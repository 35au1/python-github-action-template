Why isn't UFO hearing tearing up Google trends? | Opinion\n\nYou would think if anything could break through the noise of our news cycle, UFOs could.\n\nThis needs to be a bigger deal folks because the American people, nay people of the world, need this right now.\n\nLast week, for the second time in two years, there was a Congressional subcommittee hearing on UFOs, or as they have been foolishly rebranded \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d shortened to UAPs.\n\nOne of the visionaries helping uncover the truth is none other than Wisconsin Congressman Glenn Grothman, R-Fond du Lac, who chairs the House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs.\n\nEditorial: Hovde's election claims are false. He's blaming Milwaukee \u2013 without evidence.\n\nLast week\u2019s hearing, \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\" including a new slate of witnesses who provided testimony about UFO sightings and what the government may or may not know about them. One witness, Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence officer, went so far to say, \"Excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public, all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nAlien spacecraft and dead extraterrestrials now in Congressional Record\n\nLast year\u2019s testimony included former Pentagon official David Grusch telling a Congressional committee that he\u2019d learned of a decades-long Pentagon program focused on \u201ccrash retrieval and reverse engineering\u201d of UFOs from other planets. Grusch also said that remains found at the spacecraft crash sites were \u201cnon-human biologics.\u201d\n\nYes, crashed alien spacecraft and dead extraterrestrials made it to the Congressional Record.\n\nHowever, neither in the aftermath of last year's and last week's hearing did the terms \"UFO\" \"Alien\" \"UAP\" or even \"government coverup\" break the 25 most searched terms in Google Trends.\n\nWhat were people searching for last week? Would it surprise you if I said: \"mike tyson jake paul fight.\"\n\nTo be fair, neither of these hearings has provided real evidence to prove UFOs or UAPs are extraterrestrial in nature. But the collection of testimony indicates that UAPs are very real in the sense there are a number of as-yet-unexplained phenomena.\n\nAnd yet, apparently, most of us do not care enough to let that information even make a blip on our news cycle.\n\nAll the more reason that right now is the right time for these tight-lipped folks in defense and intelligence departments, whose jobs could very well be on the chopping block anyways in Trump's administration, to just let it rip.\n\nDeclassify everything. Tell us the truth is out there. Then send Biden and Trump out to do a tag team Bill Pullman-Independence Day-esque speech, where they encourage us to not be consumed by our petty differences and instead be united in our common interests. Give us a new enemy!\n\nOr at the very least, declassify everything just to remind humans of our standing in the universe. I don't know who said it first but right now feels like a good time for everyone to remember that we\u2019re, \"just ghosts driving meat coated skeletons made from stardust riding a rock floating through space.\"\n\nKristin Brey is the \"My Take\" columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: House committee answers questions we've long had about ET | Opinion"

Its profile, called @Nvidia_AI_PC, is dedicated to RTX AI PCs and seems to be promoting AI for the average user. Its bio says, \u201cNvidia Powers the World\u2019s AI. And Yours with RTX AI PCs,\u201d and the first pinned post says, \u201cWhether you are deep into AI or just a little curious, we\u2019re here to explore the power of AI on your local PC.\u201d\n\nThe social media profile will deliver the latest news, tech, and AI inspiration from Team Green, with the aim of promoting AI tech on consumer devices. This is particularly important as it seems that most users still haven\u2019t figured out AI, with the majority buying an AI PC not because of its AI capabilities but because it\u2019s the only available option in 2024. And although Nvidia is the leading manufacturer of AI tech in the data center and enterprise world, it probably faces its fiercest competition in the consumer space, with Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and even Apple all producing processors with built-in NPUs.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe company has previously criticized AI PCs, saying that their performance is only good for basic AI workloads and that its GPUs offer better performance, achieving 100 to more than 1,300 TOPS, depending on the model. Furthermore, we\u2019ve been hearing news and rumors that Nvidia will soon launch an Arm-based processor in 2025, which was further fueled when the heads of Nvidia, TSMC, MediaTek, and Quanta were spotted having dinner before Computex 2024. Although it\u2019s easy to brush off this event as just industry leaders enjoying some time off, it could also be a cap to an informal agreement where Nvidia produces consumer AI CPUs, especially as these four companies are what you need to produce a laptop from scratch.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s no secret that Nvidia wants to enter the CPU market. It even attempted to buy Arm, the company behind the architecture of Snapdragon X and Apple M chips. Unfortunately, the deal was shot down by several government regulators, including the U.S.\u2019s FTC and the U.K.\u2019s CMA. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Masayoshi Son, the head of SoftBank, the investment group that owns 90% of Arm, regret that they both did not take the opportunity to merge the two companies about a decade ago.\n\nThe company\u2019s move to launch the Nvidia AI PC account Twitter/X is one more sign that the company is trying to emulate its success in data center AI in the consumer space. If and when Nvidia launches its own AI CPU, it would add one more competitor in the processor market \u2014 a space that\u2019s increasingly becoming crowded with Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple all jostling for a bigger slice of the pie."

Like rivals Amazon.com and Google, Microsoft's engineers say there is a performance and price benefit to designing chips that are customized for its needs.\n\nDesigning custom chips can reduce Microsoft's reliance on processors made by Intel and Nvidia.\n\nMicrosoft's two new chips are designed to be installed deep within the company's data center infrastructure. One chip is designed to increase security and the other is for data processing.\n\nThe company makes the effort to design an array of data center processors because it aims to \"optimize every layer of infrastructure\" and ensures that Microsoft's data centers crunch information at the speed AI requires, said Rani Borkar, corporate vice president, Azure Hardware Systems and Infrastructure\n\nEngineers will install the new security chip called the Azure Integrated HSM in every new server destined for a data center beginning next year. The chip aims to keep crucial encryption and other security data inside the security module.\n\nThe data processing unit, or DPU, aims to move multiple components of a server into a single chip that is focused on cloud storage data. The company said it can run these specific tasks at three times less power and four times the performance compared with its current hardware.\n\nMicrosoft also announced a new version of a cooling system for data center servers that relies on liquid to reduce the temperature of nearby components. The cooling unit can be used to support large-scale AI systems."

Advertisement\n\nIn the more than 95 years since it was built, 272 Innisfil St. has been home to a slaughterhouse and an antique market, but according to the team from a popular YouTube series, it\u2019s also home to several ghosts.\n\nRaif Boric and Krista Maryk, who make up two-thirds of the paranormal investigative team of Walking Among Us, spent three hours inside the 25,000-square-foot building near Essa Road earlier this month after they heard of some of the not-so-normal things that have taken place there.\n\nShirley Sanford, owner of Sanford and Son Emporium which is located inside the building, told BarrieToday the team came for a visit on Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cOne of my employees was talking to one of the customers and something was brought up about the spirits that are in that building,\" she said. \"The woman said she knew some people that do the paranormal thing, so she asked if it would be OK if they phone me.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to see what was going on.\u201d\n\nIn the five years that she\u2019s been in the building, Sanford said she\u2019s seen plenty of \u201cunexplainable\u201d things take place.\n\n\u201cAbout three weeks ago, I was up in a booth. Everybody had left and I was doing my rounds at night for closing,\" she said. \"I went into this booth and was looking to see what new things they\u2019d brought in. I could hear a woman and a man's voice \u2026 I thought maybe there was a radio in the booth and it was on low and they\u2019d forgotten to turn it off, but there was no radio.\u201d\n\nSanford poked around a little more, but couldn\u2019t find any source for the noise. And despite being late and alone, she wasn\u2019t fearful.\n\nThe next week while doing her closing routine, Sanford said an Elvis clock started singing.\n\n\u201cThere is an Elvis clock hanging on the wall \u2026 so I thought OK, it\u2019s a motion-sensor thing. I went into the booth and I was singing and dancing and then all of a sudden it shut off,\" she said. \"I went back and forth three times that night into where I had triggered it and nothing.\n\nShirley Sanford is the owner of Sanford and Sons Emporium on Innisfil Street in Barrie. | Nikki Cole/BarrieToday files\n\n\"The next morning when I came into work, I went to try it and nothing. I pulled the clock off the wall and you have to push a button for it to go off,\u201d she said.\n\nShe remembers another incident which included a ladder that was found in the middle of the floor; despite the shop having been closed, it was nearby a spot where she said a man had hanged himself.\n\nThe building has been the scene of five separate deaths, Sanford told BarrieToday, including two suicides, one person who was gored by a cow, and two who were killed in a boiler-room explosion.\n\nAs for what occurred on the property prior to the building\u2019s construction in 1929, she has no idea and said it could very well play a role in the site\u2019s haunting.\n\nRaif Boric, lead investigator for Walking Among Us, said that going into their visit, they didn\u2019t know too much about the structure's history, nor were they aware of what had occurred there over the years.\n\n\u201cIt was just kind of like let\u2019s go and see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met up with Shirley \u2026 and we both went to different spots \u2026 to see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhile he was by himself with the spouse of one of the store\u2019s employees on one side of the building, he says he was drawn to a doll on a shelf, telling BarrieToday he is a collector of \u201chaunted artifacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have six haunted dolls and a haunted teddy bear at home. This doll just drew me in,\" Boric said. \"When it was time to start, I went up to the doll and set up some motion-sensored cat balls, a REM pod (which is a piece of ghost-hunting equipment that indicates changes in ambient temperature) and had my cameras going. This thing would not stop with the motion-sensored cat balls and there were noises going on all in the area,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, I was standing there asking questions and we heard a little girl call out. We looked at each other like \u2018what the (heck) was that!?\u2019\u201d\n\nBoric said they went to explore where the sound came from, which is when he heard Maryk yelling from where she was in the building.\n\n\u201cWe started running back and she was where the doll was \u2026 and asked what all the banging was about,\u201d he said, adding neither he nor the employee\u2019s wife knew what his partner was talking about. \"We\u2019d just heard the kid\u2019s voice, which is where Shirley had heard disembodied voices in the area previously.\u201d\n\nBoric told BarrieToday it felt like a game of cat and mouse trying to track down the spirits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve encountered that a lot, and it sometimes gets a little annoying because you go thinking you\u2019re going to experience something and it just leads you around the building,\" he said. \u201cIt was a good experience and there was a plethora of (paranormal) activity.\"\n\nBoric ended up bringing the \u201chaunted doll\u201d home to add to his collection.\n\n\u201cI have her in the room with the other ones,\" he said. \"I am pretty sure her arm moved the other night, so I am setting up a security camera in the haunted room.\u201d\n\nSanford says she found the entire experience \u201cfascinating,\u201d adding she \"absolutely\" believes in ghosts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get scared over any of this stuff that happens. I am all for it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen these guys came in, I saw it for myself. The white orbs and the one gentleman at the very end had forgotten something upstairs \u2026 When we got up there, one of the revolving showcases was on and (it) hadn\u2019t been on 15 minutes early when we\u2019d been up there.\u201d\n\nThe episode is expected to air on the Walking Among Us YouTube channel in January 2025."

In 2022, he developed a podcast \u201cHassing The Paranormal\u201d with KXRW, an independent radio show in Vancouver.\n\nHis advice for students interested in pursuing a career in paranormal investigations is to find a team in your area that fits your investigation type.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re into more logic-basedlike Big River does, then join a team like that. Or if you like psychic stuff, then join a team like that,\u201d Hassler said.\n\nIt is important to join an already established team because it is difficult to start one on your own, he said.\n\nIf students are interested in joining an investigation their website Big River Paranormal has investigation date options.\n\nThe two locations available are the Old Idaho State Penitentiary and the Geiser Grand Hotel.\n\nAlejandra Prado, the Student Entertainment Board\u2019s speaker director, encourages all students to take advantage of this connection.\n\nThis is Prado\u2019s first semester on the board, and her fascination with the paranormal was the inspiration to bring Hassler to campus last month.

        "article_content": "Alan Wake 2 was the game that fully connected the entire Remedy universe, but it all started with Control. Set in The Oldest House, home of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), Jesse Faden became the new director as she used her transforming gun and powers to defeat the Hiss. A DLC chapter connected her with Alan Wake, and now another piece of DLC for Alan Wake 2 has shifted the focus back on the FBC. Control 2 is the next chapter of this dark and paranormal story unlike anything else on our list of upcoming video games. It will still be a while before we return to the world of altered items of objects of power, so thankfully we have games like Civilization VII and Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows to hold us over, but there\u2019s nothing that can scratch that specific itch Control did. This is our declassified document on everything we know about Control 2.\n\nIf you\u2019re still on the lookout for the best upcoming PS5 games, we\u2019ve got you covered there too.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nRelease speculation\n\nThere\u2019s no word on when Control 2 will launch as of now. The game was first officially announced at the end of 2022 when it was first entering production, but in October of 2023 revealed that the game was still only in its \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d stage. Based on that, we might not see Control 2 until 2026 or later.\n\nPlatforms\n\nRemedy games since Quantum Break have never been platform-exclusive and we don\u2019t anticipate that changing for Control 2. You should expect to see it on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC at least, but possibly Switch 2 as well.\n\nTrailers\n\nNo footage for Control 2 has been shared yet, but it sounds like Remedy may be ready to show us the game soon based on how much it is talking about it. Who we play as, where, and what we\u2019ll be doing is all up in the air.\n\nGameplay\n\nNews from our Capital Markets day: \ud83d\udd26 Alan Wake 2 has sold over 1.8M units\n\n\ud83d\udd3b Control Ultimate Edition will release on Mac February 12th, 2025\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Control 2 will be an action RPG\n\n\ud83c\udf81 Control will receive a free update in early 2025, unlocking some previously released content \ud83d\udd0e\u2026 pic.twitter.com/AX1jqpNTkt \u2014 Remedy Entertainment (@remedygames) November 19, 2024\n\nThe only concrete detail we know about Control 2\u2018s gameplay is that it will be an action RPG. This was revealed by Remedy Entertainment itself, which lines up with how the first game played. It will also have a budget of approximately $52.9 million. This is low for most modern games, but quite a bit more than the first game\u2019s $30 million budget.\n\nControl 2 will almost certainly still be a third-person shooter with various weapon modes, psychic powers, and skill trees. How Remedy expands on those elements or what it decides to add is yet to be seen.\n\nPreorder\n\nThere will be no preorder details until Control 2 has a solid release date. As soon as they are available, we will update this article."

        "article_content": "Data engineers face numerous challenges in managing large datasets, maintaining quality control, and handling complex workflows, which can impede productivity. \u201cAlmost 70-80% of the work involves data preparation, engineering, and standardisation. It\u2019s all manual work, and frankly, the most painful activity,\u201d said DataSwitch chief Karthikeyan Viswanathan in an exclusive interview with AIM.\n\nHandling data from diverse sources presents a major obstacle for engineers managing multiple-source extractions. Beyond collection, ensuring quality and consistency across these varied inputs remains critical, as poor data can lead to flawed insights and decisions.\n\nHowever, the task is easier said than done. Merging data from different sources in varied formats and schemas is a labour-intensive job often involving custom coding and manual scripting.\n\nA frequent gripe is that data engineers spend much of their time buried in code and debugging, leaving little room for true innovation. Therefore, as data volumes continue to surge, scalable and efficient data pipelines become essential.\n\n\u201cData engineering is more than just writing pipelines with SQL and Python. It\u2019s about solving business problems and delighting end-users,\u201d said Zach Morris Wilson, the founder of Dataexpert.io. He added that data engineers who understand the business they\u2019re working in have a significant advantage because they know when to say no to low-value requests.\n\nA data engineering professional on X pointed out, \u201cWe have a data engineering problem. AI keeps getting better, but the inputs needed are trash or hard to get. The big money is going to be in securing the best quality data possible.\u201d\n\nToday, every enterprise wants to use AI, but most data isn\u2019t ready for it. This disconnect between AI aspirations and data readiness can result in failed projects, wasted resources, and missed opportunities.\n\nSeveral challenges hinder enterprise AI readiness, including data silos, quality issues, lack of governance, integration difficulties, and the overwhelming volume and velocity of data generated daily.\n\nTo bridge the gap between current data states and AI readiness, enterprises should focus on establishing an AI vision and data strategy, implementing robust data governance, improving data quality, developing scalable infrastructure, prioritising data integration, adopting DataOps practices, and investing in data engineering talent.\n\nInterestingly, a Gartner report highlights that synthetic data generated with generative AI could reduce the volume of real data needed for machine learning by half by 2024. The report recommends building AI into all capabilities, including data ingestion, data quality, cost monitoring, insight generation, and sharing, to address bottlenecks and accelerate data and analytics pipelines.\n\nDS Integrate to the Rescue\n\nThis is where DS Integrate comes into play. It offers a user-friendly interface with pre-built connectors and functionalities, enabling businesses to ingest data from various sources and transform it into a usable format without extensive coding expertise.\n\nIts toolkit supports various data formats, including structured and unstructured data, from sources such as PDFs, images, and text files. By automatically generating code for data catalogue creation, DS Integrate greatly minimises the manual effort needed for data preparation.\n\n\u201cWith no code, DS Integrate will reduce the dependency on core technology personnel, allowing business professionals themselves to perform data analysis. That is one of the objectives; it\u2019s not that DataSwitch is killing jobs,\u201d said Viswanathan.\n\nHe stressed that to get the most out of AI, the data must be well-prepared. According to him, this means prioritising both \u201cAI for data\u201d and \u201cdata for AI\u201d and making the processes more self-serviceable. \u201cWe want to make our customers\u2019 data ready, standardised, and prepared for AI use, as this is a common challenge every enterprise faces,\u201d he said.\n\nDS Integrate automatically generates code to create a knowledge base in a format compatible with cloud databases such as Spark, Talend, Matillion, DataBricks, and more.\n\nAlso, after standardising data, DS Integrate enables users to convert raw data into valuable insights without requiring advanced coding skills. This approach, termed Citizen Data Engineering, dramatically improves accessibility to data engineering and encourages innovation and agility, facilitating quick adaptation to changing market dynamics.\n\nEven though data engineering is a tough job, it is highly sought after. According to AIM Research, 10,593 job openings for data engineers across industries were listed on online job portals.\n\n(Total 13 views)"

        "article_content": "Darien Craig and Brandon Echols have known each other since they were 6 years old in small-town Hayden, Alabama. They attended the same high school and even dropped out of college in tandem, they said on Friday's episode of ABC's \"Shark Tank.\"\n\nDuring that episode, the pair hit another milestone together: agreeing to an investment offer for their jointly owned business. Craig and Echols co-own Y'all Sweet Tea, which Craig founded in 2021 \u2014 after getting fired from his previous job, he wrote on his company's website.\n\n\"The week I got fired, I had $7 to my name,\" wrote Craig. \"With the last paycheck I received, I used the $300 from that check to purchase the first jars, sugar, and tea that would eventually catapult this idea.\"\n\nY'all sells its tea direct-to-consumer and in roughly 600 grocery store locations, mostly across the southeastern United States, Echols said on \"Shark Tank.\" It brought in $4 million in revenue, including nearly $800,000 in profit, last year, he added.\n\nThose numbers included a detail that the show's investor judges found particularly interesting: Y'all added flavored teas to its lineup last year, and sold 10,000 units of its first flavor, \"Georgia Peach,\" in just 35 minutes, Craig said. The first eight of those minutes were responsible for $100,000 in sales, he noted.\n\n\"When you're dropping that amount in that short period on your own site, that's rare,\" Kevin O'Leary said. Barbara Corcoran chimed in: \"Do you know how few entrepreneurs can make that claim?\"\n\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox. Sign up for NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n\"That is beautiful. That is like beauty,\" Mark Cuban added.\n\n'You don't need me to tell you how to run this business'\n\nCraig and Echols asked the investors for $500,000, in exchange for a 5% equity stake in their company. Guest investor Rashaun Williams, a venture capitalist and minority-stake owner of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, quickly offered them $500,000 for 10%.\n\n\"I'll let you figure out if you want to go to Walmart, if you want to stay direct-to-consumer, or what balance of both,\" said Williams. \"You don't need me to tell you how to run this business ... I think you guys are a rocket ship.\"\n\nCuban and Corcoran bowed out. Y'all was a better fit for Williams' investment style, Cuban said: Craig and Echols noted that they hoped to eventually find an exit for their company, and a professional VC investor could help them grow enough to get acquired or go public.\n\nBut O'Leary wanted in. He proposed a joint offer with Williams \u2014 $500,000 for 20% of Y'all, which the two investors would split down the middle.\n\nNot to be outdone, Lori Greiner added another joint offer with Williams to the table: $500,000 for 15% of Y'all. O'Leary promptly lowered his offer to match.\n\nCraig asked if any of the investors would chip in another $250,000. They declined, with Williams saying Y'all could always raise more money in the future.
