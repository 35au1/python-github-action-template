        "article_content": "Another New Mexico city is shining a spotlight on UFOs, but not in the way you might expect.\n\nRIO RANCHO, N.M. \u2013 Another New Mexico city is shining a spotlight on UFOs, but not in the way you might expect.\n\nThe portable classrooms at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary are the new home of the National UFO Historical Records Archive. It\u2019s the largest collection of UFO sighting documents in the country, and maybe the world.\n\nNow, thanks to a partnership with Rio Rancho Public Schools, the amateur collectors who kept all these records safe over the years are finally making them available to the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally overwhelming. People don\u2019t have any conception until they come here how much material that we\u2019re talking about. And it really, I think, makes people pause and realize there\u2019s a lot more to this UFO subject than I ever thought,\u201d said David Marler, executive director of the National UFO Historical Records Center.\n\nMarler knows the idea of a UFO records archive probably sounds silly to some folks, but he says that skepticism is welcome.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t care what your take is on the UFO subject. In fact, we welcome differing opinions, differing perspectives,\u201d said Marler.\n\nThe National UFO Historical Records Center is a nonprofit organizing hundreds of thousands of declassified government documents, news clippings, photos, videos and more evidence from across the globe all under one roof.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a traditional historical archive dedicated to a non-traditional subject. We want serious research to be conducted here in the hopes ultimately of maybe gaining a better insight into this mystery that we\u2019ve been dealing with now for 75 plus years,\u201d said Marler.\n\nHe says there are countless connections to be discovered now that all these case files are together.\n\n\u201cSome organizations interviewed witnesses that the other did not, and vice versa, and sometimes there\u2019s new insights provided by one investigative organization that was never obtained by this one,\u201d said Marler. \u201cThe more minds, the more set of eyeballs we have looking at the data as with any subject, the better we\u2019re going to be if we truly want to try to understand what we\u2019re dealing with when we talk about UFOs.\u201d\n\nMarler\u2019s collection \u2013 which used to live inside his Rio Rancho home \u2013 is largely a collection of other collections sent in from fellow UFO archivists. With all this extra space donated by Rio Rancho Public Schools, Marler says they\u2019re ready for more.\n\n\u201cWe have about 10 to 12 other collections that are also in the queue,\u201d Marler said. \u201cTwo individuals I know in Ohio have stated, \u2018You\u2019re already in my will. If anything happens to me, my material is coming to Rio Rancho.'\u201d\n\nWhether or not you believe in aliens, Marler says the overwhelming amount of documentation is worth preserving.\n\n\u201cWe feel it\u2019s important because it is an element of history, it is an element of our culture. So that\u2019s really how we try to view it,\u201d said Marler. \u201cIf we can\u2019t define the answers to the UFO mystery, maybe in 40, 50, 60, years someone might, but they can only do that by looking at the data.\u201d\n\nWhile this is a public archive, it\u2019s a not a free for all. Marler says you\u2019ll have to submit a request on their website to set up a time to come and visit. The idea is that you\u2019ll have full access to everything inside.\n\nBut why would Rio Rancho Public Schools get involved with something like this.\n\n\u201cOur students find the subject matter of UFO investigation very intriguing. And so we want to do is we want to use that as a catalyst in order to get students involved in other types of learning,\u201d said RRPS Chief Operating Officer Michael Baker. \u201cSo we think that the parents, as long as the students are learning, we\u2019re not trying to persuade thinking one way or another, we think we\u2019re going to see some really good benefits from this area.\u201d\n\nDistrict officials say the partnership is expected to last at least five years.\n\nAnother New Mexico city is shining a spotlight on UFOs, but not in the way you might expect."

GPT-4 is pretty fancy, but it's not always the best option for every type of content you want to create. The only problem is if you want more options, that often means more subscriptions. At least, it would if you didn't have the option to get multiple AI models for life by getting 1minAI.\n\n1minAI users can access some of the biggest and most advanced AI tools in one convenient app. This lifetime subscription gives you access to Chat GPT-4, Mistral AI, Midjourney, Gemini, and a lot more for just \u00a330.80.\n\nWhat does 1minAI do?\n\nOne AI hub where you can access models for generating text, images, and editing audio seems a little too good to be true, so here's the catch. There's a finite amount you can generate every month, but you get 450,000 credits per month, and unused credits roll over. If you're using 1minAI for work, that means your vacation time isn't wasting credits you've already paid for.\n\nThe list of AI models included with 1min is seriously impressive. Check it out:\n\nGPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 (OpenAI)\n\nClaude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 2.1, Claude Instant 1.2 (Anthropic)\n\nGemini Pro 1.5, Gemini Pro 1.0 (GoogleAI)\n\nLlama 3, Llama 2 (MetaAI)\n\nMistralAI\n\nCommand (Cohere)\n\nThe AI writing tools are super versatile. Working on an SEO project? Save time doing keyword research. Can't remember what passive voice is? One can be helped by an AI grammar tool. There's even a paraphraser for research and a ton of social tools for writing Facebook, LinkedIn, and X content.\n\nNot all of these AI models are for generating text. You can generate images, turn text to speech or speech to text, enhance videos, or even use AI to look over a PDF file. Now, instead of skimming a whole long document, you can just ask AI to answer your questions for you.\n\nYour AI team\n\nYou don't have to subscribe to every big AI tool anymore.

Now the company is spinning off Highlight into a new entity, which has raised $10 million in a funding round.\n\nGeneral Catalyst led the funding round with Valor, SV Angel, and Conviction Embed participating in the round. Medal also put in $3 million in the new entity out of $13 million it raised in July.\n\nMedal\u2019s co-founder, Pim de Witte, is the only common link between Medal and Highlight now, as the latter has its own team, including Haris Butt, who was VP of Design at productivity company ClickUp, Medal co-founder Josh Lipson, and Medal\u2019s first head of growth Mark Bond.\n\n\u201cWe started Highlight as a research project within Medal. We wanted to explore the translation layer between LLMs (large language models) and what\u2019s going on your screen. But we realized to grow quickly and hire engineers for a specific app by offering them equity, Highlight needs to be a separate entity,\u201d de Witte told TechCrunch over a call.\n\nHighlight is a cross-platform desktop app that lets you attach your screen, a voice note, or a document as context and then ask questions to an LLM. The app can also transcribe your calls from system audio, so you can ask questions about a particular meeting later.\n\nYou can perform actions that have become pretty common with AI assistants, such as summarizing, rewriting, highlighting, and explaining the context attached to the app at the time of querying.\n\nIn July, the company had opened its platform for developers to build apps on top of Highlight. However, the startup realized that this approach would limit custom actions to a handful of developers. With the latest version, the company will allow users to prompt their way to a custom action like summarizing the first 10 minutes of a meeting. Highlight also wants to open up prompts to the community of users, helping one person discover a useful automation someone has created.\n\nFor developers with programming knowledge, the company plans to open an agentic framework that will allow them to use parts of your system and do small tasks \u2014 such as summarizing documents in a particular folder \u2014 in the background.\n\n\u201cOur idea is to create virtual employees so you can start delegating some of your tasks to them and have more time on your hands,\u201d de Witte said.\n\nImage Credits:Highlight\n\nWith today\u2019s announcement, the company is releasing a push-to-talk shortcut and new conversations app that records your meetings.\n\nNiko Bonatsos, managing director at General Catalyst, told TechCrunch over email that Highlight is easy to understand for users because of the on-screen context and the lack of complex prompts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been underwhelmed by the fact that most consumer-facing AI companies only let you interact with them via chat interfaces \u2026 This demonstrates a lack of imagination and frankly limits what is possible with this powerful new technology. We are very encouraged with the bold design choices that Pim and his team have made so far,\u201d Bonatsos said, pointing out that Highlight\u2019s combination of automation and on-screen context allows users to utilize AI better.\n\nHighlight AI is free to use for now, but the company wants to adopt a pricing plan based on the word count processed by the assistant down the line."

        "article_content": "In a pitch to investors last spring, Anthropic said it intended to build AI to power virtual assistants that could perform research, answer emails, and handle other back-office jobs on their own. The company referred to this as a \u201cnext-gen algorithm for AI self-teaching\u201d \u2014 one it believed that could, if all goes according to plan, automate large portions of the economy someday.\n\nIt took a while, but that AI is starting to arrive.\n\nAnthropic on Tuesday released an upgraded version of its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model that can understand and interact with any desktop app. Via a new \u201cComputer Use\u201d API, now in open beta, the model can imitate keystrokes, button clicks, and mouse gestures, essentially emulating a person sitting at a PC.\n\n\u201cWe trained Claude to see what\u2019s happening on a screen and then use the software tools available to carry out tasks,\u201d Anthropic wrote in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. \u201cWhen a developer tasks Claude with using a piece of computer software and gives it the necessary access, Claude looks at screenshots of what\u2019s visible to the user, then counts how many pixels vertically or horizontally it needs to move a cursor in order to click in the correct place.\u201d\n\nDevelopers can try out Computer Use via Anthropic\u2019s API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI platform. The new 3.5 Sonnet without Computer Use is rolling out to Claude apps, and brings various performance improvements over the outgoing 3.5 Sonnet model.\n\nAutomating apps\n\nA tool that can automate tasks on a PC is hardly a novel idea. Countless companies offer such tools, from decades-old RPA vendors to newer upstarts like Relay, Induced AI, and Automat.\n\nIn the race to develop so-called \u201cAI agents,\u201d the field has only become more crowded. AI agents remains an ill-defined term, but it generally refers to AI that can automate software.\n\nSome analysts say AI agents could provide companies with an easier path to monetizing the billions of dollars that they\u2019re pouring into AI. Companies seem to agree: According to a recent Capgemini survey, 10% of organizations already use AI agents and 82% will integrate them within the next three years.\n\nSalesforce made splashy announcements about its AI agent tech this summer, while Microsoft touted new tools for building AI agents yesterday. OpenAI, which is plotting its own brand of AI agents, sees the tech as a step toward super-intelligent AI.\n\nAnthropic calls its take on the AI agent concept an \u201caction-execution layer\u201d that lets the new 3.5 Sonnet perform desktop-level commands. Thanks to its ability to browse the web (not a first for AI models, but a first for Anthropic), 3.5 Sonnet can use any website and any application.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s new AI can control apps on a PC. Image Credits:Anthropic\n\n\u201cHumans remain in control by providing specific prompts that direct Claude\u2019s actions, like \u2018use data from my computer and online to fill out this form\u2019,\u201d an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cPeople enable access and limit access as needed. Claude breaks down the user\u2019s prompts into computer commands (e.g. moving the cursor, clicking, typing) to accomplish that specific task.\u201d\n\nSoftware development platform Replit has used an early version of the new 3.5 Sonnet model to create an \u201cautonomous verifier\u201d that can evaluate apps while they\u2019re being built. Canva, meanwhile, says that it\u2019s exploring ways in which the new model might be able to support the designing and editing process.\n\nBut how is this any different than the other AI agents out there? It\u2019s a reasonable question. Consumer gadget startup Rabbit is building a web agent that can do things like buying movie tickets online; Adept, which was recently acqui-hired by Amazon, trains models to browse websites and navigate software; and Twin Labs is using off-the-shelf models, including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, to automate desktop processes.\n\nAnthropic claims the new 3.5 Sonnet is simply a stronger, more robust model that can do better on coding tasks than even OpenAI\u2019s flagship o1, per the SWE-bench Verified benchmark. Despite not being explicitly trained to do so, the upgraded 3.5 Sonnet self-corrects and retries tasks when it encounters obstacles, and can work toward objectives that require dozens or hundreds of steps.\n\nThe new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model\u2019s performance on various benchmarks. Image Credits:Anthropic\n\nBut don\u2019t fire your secretary just yet.\n\nIn an evaluation designed to test an AI agent\u2019s ability to help with airline booking tasks, like modifying a flight reservation, the new 3.5 Sonnet managed to complete less than half of the tasks successfully. In a separate test involving tasks like initiating a return, 3.5 Sonnet failed roughly a third of the time.\n\nAnthropic admits the upgraded 3.5 Sonnet struggles with basic actions like scrolling and zooming, and that it can miss \u201cshort-lived\u201d actions and notifications because of the way it takes screenshots and pieces them together.\n\n\u201cClaude\u2019s Computer Use remains slow and often error-prone,\u201d Anthropic writes in its post. \u201cWe encourage developers to begin exploration with low-risk tasks.\u201d\n\nRisky business\n\nBut is the new 3.5 Sonnet capable enough to be dangerous? Possibly.\n\nA recent study found that models without the ability to use desktop apps, like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, were willing to engage in harmful \u201cmulti-step agent behavior,\u201d such as ordering a fake passport from someone on the dark web, when \u201cattacked\u201d using jailbreaking techniques. Jailbreaks led to high rates of success in performing harmful tasks even for models protected by filters and safeguards, according to the researchers.\n\nOne can imagine how a model with desktop access could wreak more havoc \u2014 say, by exploiting app vulnerabilities to compromise personal info (or storing chats in plaintext). Aside from the software levers at its disposal, the model\u2019s online and app connections could open avenues for malicious jailbreakers.\n\nAnthropic doesn\u2019t deny that there\u2019s risk in releasing the new 3.5 Sonnet. But the company argues that the benefits of observing how the model is used in the wild ultimately outweigh this risk.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s far better to give access to computers to today\u2019s more limited, relatively safer models,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cThis means we can begin to observe and learn from any potential issues that arise at this lower level, building up computer use and safety mitigations gradually and simultaneously.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Anthropic\n\nAnthropic also says it has taken steps to deter misuse, like not training the new 3.5 Sonnet on users\u2019 screenshots and prompts, and preventing the model from accessing the web during training. The company says it developed classifiers to \u201cnudge\u201d 3.5 Sonnet away from actions perceived as high-risk, such as posting on social media, creating accounts, and interacting with government websites.\n\nAs the U.S. general election nears, Anthropic says it is focused on mitigating election-related abuse of its models. The U.S. AI Safety Institute and U.K. Safety Institute, two separate but allied government agencies dedicated to evaluating AI model risk, tested the new 3.5 Sonnet prior to its deployment.\n\nAnthropic told TechCrunch it has the ability to restrict access to additional websites and features \u201cif necessary,\u201d to protect against spam, fraud, and misinformation, for example. As a safety precaution, the company retains any screenshots captured by Computer Use for at least 30 days \u2014 a retention period that might alarm some devs.\n\nWe asked Anthropic under which circumstances, if any, it would hand over screenshots to a third party (e.g. law enforcement) if asked. A spokesperson said that the company would \u201ccomply with requests for data in response to valid legal process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no foolproof methods, and we will continuously evaluate and iterate on our safety measures to balance Claude\u2019s capabilities with responsible use,\u201d Anthropic said. \u201cThose using the computer-use version of Claude should take the relevant precautions to minimize these kinds of risks, including isolating Claude from particularly sensitive data on their computer.\u201d\n\nHopefully, that\u2019ll be enough to prevent the worst from occurring.\n\nA cheaper model\n\nToday\u2019s headliner might\u2019ve been the upgraded 3.5 Sonnet model, but Anthropic also said an updated version of Haiku, the cheapest, most efficient model in its Claude series, is on the way.\n\nClaude 3.5 Haiku, due in the coming weeks, will match the performance of Claude 3 Opus, once Anthropic\u2019s state-of-the-art model, on certain benchmarks at the same cost and \u201capproximate speed\u201d of Claude 3 Haiku.\n\n\u201cWith low latency, improved instruction following, and more accurate tool use, Claude 3.5 Haiku is well suited for user-facing products, specialized sub-agent tasks, and generating personalized experiences from huge volumes of data\u2013like purchase history, pricing, or inventory data,\u201d Anthropic wrote in a blog post.\n\n3.5 Haiku will initially be available as a text-only model and later as part of a multimodal package that can analyze both text and images.\n\n3.5 Haiku\u2019s benchmark performance. Image Credits:Anthropic\n\nSo once 3.5 Haiku is available, will there be much reason to use 3 Opus? What about 3.5 Opus, 3 Opus\u2019 successor, which Anthropic teased back in June?\n\n\u201cAll of the models in the Claude 3 model family have their individual uses for customers,\u201d the Anthropic spokesperson said. \u201cClaude 3.5 Opus is on our roadmap and we\u2019ll be sure to share more as soon as we can.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Maybe.\n\nSusan Crane, a program manager for the Oak Park Park District, won\u2019t say what\u2019s there, but evidently it was enough to hire a team of paranormal investigators to find out exactly what\u2019s going on.\n\nAnd they\u2019re inviting interested spectators to join them on a \u201cthrilling journey through the dimly lit corridors and eerie rooms of this renowned estate, rumored to be a hotspot for supernatural activity,\u201d according to materials provided by the Park District.\n\nOn Friday, anyone over 21 can see, feel or hear for themselves what all lurks in the old home during a Park District event featuring paranormal experts Other Side Investigations.\n\nCrane said it will be OSI\u2019s first investigation for the Park District, though they\u2019ve been active in the Midwest for years. The team has been on site for preliminary inspection, however and Crane hosted another Pleasant Home ghost investigation a few years ago. But she\u2019s keeping mum about whatever she learned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say a word,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put any ideas into anybody\u2019s head. And when they came to look at the house, I didn\u2019t say anything. I can tell you one thing \u2014 there\u2019s nothing harmful or evil or anything like that. That\u2019s as specific as I want to get.\u201d\n\nThe event, listed on the Park District\u2019s website, has been a hot ticket item, with almost all 50 spots already gone \u2014 Crane said only about eight $50 tickets remain. At the very least, visitors are guaranteed a snack, a beverage and a tour of one of the oldest and grandest addresses in Oak Park.\n\nCrane said she wanted the event to be, above all, a fun night out for people. A chance to see friends, see history and tour a beautiful, restored local property.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old house, it was built in 1897,\u201d Crane said. \u201cWe manage two homes; both are over 100 years old. This is another way to make the patrons engaged and see the historic houses. The Pleasant Home is one of the earliest examples of prairie style architecture in the country, so it\u2019s well-known to architecture buffs and the tour is another way for people to enjoy the home.\u201d\n\nVisitors will also get to learn a bit more about what it takes to detect the paranormal. The OSI team will divide the 50 people into two or three smaller groups and introduce attendees to their gear first \u2014 equipment to measure light, temperature, noise and more.\n\n\u201cThere is a science behind it, it\u2019s not just them talking about what they feel and what they may or may not see,\u201d Crane said.\n\nFrom there the tour will continue through the home, room by room, looking, listening and feeling things that just aren\u2019t right, maybe a cold spot, a strange, sudden bump or maybe a slight glimmer in a mirror, a face in the shadow something fleeting something you\u2019re sure you saw and you hope was caught on film.\n\nWhatever happens, Crane is ready for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think when we\u2019ve done it in the past, it\u2019s been really well received and I\u2019m looking forward to Friday night.\u201d\n\nAnd who knows. Maybe the house is looking forward to the visit, too.\n\nJesse Wright is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press."

Brittany Fournier photo\n\nclick to enlarge Slevin uses every device and method in his and his team's toolbox to find out what's really going down. Bill Slevin photo\n\nWhen world-famous paranormal investigator Bill Slevin spoke during our interview about ghosts and demons, the recording device on my computer started to skip around. Listening back on our conversation, portions became fuzzy, especially as he spoke about exorcisms. The hair stood up on my neck, but the Coral Springs resident was such a compelling storyteller that it was hard to stop chatting.Slevin has been investigating these unknown forces for 35 years but has experienced paranormal events his whole life. Growing up in the 1970s and '80s, nobody talked about supernatural things. \"I never knew what an empath was. I just knew I would go places and feel weird things,\" he recalls. As an empath, he felt other people's emotions and sometimes carried them with him. As a kid, he was also into horror movies and was never scared \u2014 except when he sawHe was curious about paranormal experiences and started to research everything he could about them. He went on to get his PhD in parapsychology and metaphysical humanistic science and has studied quantum physics and mechanics.The first of his more than 1,000 residential haunting jobs was in 1989. A friend brought him in on a frightening investigation. \"Demons are very rare; it's not like TV,\" he says. \"It happened to be a rare demonic case. The guy with me got full-on attacked. That team never did this again, but it gave me a million questions.\" He realized this was his calling. \"I really wanted to know what was real and what was not,\" Slevin says.He and his team at the nonprofit Paranormal Existence Research Society (PERS) are based out of Coral Springs, with teams in other Florida cities, Georgia, Nebraska, the UK, Italy, and Greece. They don't charge people for their work \u2014 it's all free \u2014 but if someone out of state wants to work with them, they will let them pay for travel. \"We don't feel it's ethical [to charge] because it's not 100 percent science.\" His team is a diverse group of talents and includes a Peruvian shaman, hypnotherapist, licensed psychologist, mediums, and psychics.\"We're a mix of intuition and science,\" he says. \"We help these people no matter what.\" That includes people who are suffering from mental illness or substance use issues. Slevin works a day job as an IT director for a psychiatric drug and alcohol treatment facility, which has provided him with the knowledge to identify when clients are suffering from these issues and not an actual haunting.When they first get asked to investigate, the team interviews the clients. If they take the case, they go to the homes at night using a combination of his empath abilities and certain devices. \"Being IT and paranormal \u2014 a very bad mix,\" he jokes. \"I have a ridiculous amount of equipment.\" They experiment with audio and video tools and observe environmental cues with a healthy amount of skepticism. They first assess to see if there are natural causes for the experiences of the clients, like animals in the walls, and they determine if it's a case of the paranormal.\"Everything is energy. When you die, your energy doesn't die. Energy can't be destroyed or created,\" he says. The most common thing his team finds is residual hauntings, in which a person leaves behind energy. He remembers a haunting incident in New Jersey when a client in an old house said that every day at 7 p.m., they heard footsteps up the stairs. The team heard them but couldn't connect with a spirit. It was likely, he says, a \"footprint\" left by someone who passed that walked there daily. The solution? To cleanse the area is something his team teaches people to do for themselves. \"Anybody can wave sage around the house, and it's not going to do anything. It's your intention [that matters],\" and even then, energy can return.To cleanse or protect themselves and their clients, they respect the religious and spiritual beliefs of the people they're helping. If someone is Jewish, for instance, they won't come in waving crucifixes. Unless, that is, if they suspect it's a demonic entity, then they'll use everything in their arsenal to protect themselves.It's usually not anything that sinister. Even funky energy from living clients can cause hauntings. \"Sometimes people can watch five hours of, and now they're panicked, and they can actually manifest stuff to the house. It might not be real.\" He says parapsychology studies have shown that \"a lot of Poltergeist activity is caused by teenagers. That their energy shift is so strong, especially females, that it can actually make things move,\" he says. \"It's not going to pick up a couch and throw it across the room.\"In South Florida, you may not have very old houses, but there are a lot of Indigenous American burial grounds. He used to bring new members of his team to Belgrade, Florida, where there was a 280-acre abandoned prison in the middle of a sugarcane field. \"Because you can say you're into this, but when you're in an abandoned prison at two o'clock in the morning, there's a lot of activity in that place,\" he says. There's now a warehouse built in that spot. \"If they'd built houses there, I'd be going door to door to drop off my card.\"Slevin educates the public about issues related to the supernatural. He's the director and manager of the Warren Legacy Foundation for Paranormal Research, founded by Lorraine Warren and Chris McKinnell, the grandson of Ed and Lorraine Warren, who investigated the Amityville haunting. He speaks as a celebrity guest at conferences and has appeared on TV, radio, podcasts, magazines, and newspapers. He's been on the cover ofmagazine five times.He also spoke about demonology on the Travel Channel documentary, which also streams on Discovery+ and Max. It explores a possible mass possession at the Miami Aerospace Academy High School in 1970. Students ripped doors off the hinges, one girl levitated, and another boy jumped out of the second-floor window unscathed, landing face-first on the concrete and then threw the security guard across the parking lot. The interviewing process unnerved him because when the producers asked specific demonology questions, he didn't want to share any misinformation with the public. He says they're very real but very rare.Slevin will speak at upcoming events at the Coconut Grove and Coral Springs libraries. At his library shows, you can hear more of Slevin's spooky stories, learn about haunted places in South Florida, and see evidence that the paranormal is actually quite normal."

        "article_content": "Donald Johanson really had no business going bone hunting that Sunday. There were letters to write and fossils to catalog\u2014heaps of paperwork left undone while fellow paleoanthropologists were visiting his camp in Ethiopia\u2019s Afar region.\n\nBut graduate student Tom Gray was headed out to map the fossil site, Hadar, and he needed a guide to Locality 162. So Johanson ignored his better judgment in favor of what he later called a \u201cgut sense\u201d and set off with Gray and company in a Land Rover.\n\nA good two hours into the search, that gut sense had only netted them a handful of animal fossil fragments, and the late-morning temperature had already topped 100\u00b0F. They made one last sweep of a peripheral gully\u2014nothing doing\u2014and decided to call it a day.\n\nThen, \u201cas we turned to leave,\u201d Johanson recalled, \u201cI noticed something lying on the ground partway up the slope.\u201d It was 2-inch-long bone shard that he immediately recognized as \u201cpart of an elbow.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t alone: A closer scan turned up bits of a skull, a femur, a pelvis, and more.\n\n\u201cAn unbelievable, impermissible thought flickered through my mind,\u201d Johanson wrote. \u201cSuppose all these fitted together? Could they be parts of a single, extremely primitive skeleton? No such skeleton had ever been found\u2014anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe camp buzzed with the thrill of a big break long before Johanson could answer that question. That night, November 24, 1974, nobody slept, beer flowed as freely as conversation, and a tape recorder blared the Beatles\u2019 \u201cLucy in the Sky With Diamonds\u201d on repeat. By morning, the skeleton that would forever alter our understanding of human evolution had a name: Lucy.\n\nWalk Tall\n\nHadar, located in the Afar region\u2019s Awash River valley, is a dry expanse of eroded sedimentary deposits formed in part by prehistoric rivers and volcanic eruptions. Thanks to its geological backstory, it\u2019s a fossil gold mine. French geologist Maurice Taieb put Johanson on to the site\u2019s paleoanthropological potential when Johanson was still a Ph.D. student in the early 1970s, and the two teamed up for their inaugural expedition during the fall of 1973.\n\nJohanson hoped to find evidence of early species in a category now commonly known as hominins, which includes all human species and their immediate ancestors. Hominins (Hominini) are a tribe (i.e. a subgroup) of the hominid family (Hominidae), which also features chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, as well as their immediate ancestors. Modern humans are Homo sapiens, the only hominin species that exists today, and how exactly we evolved as we are is buried deep within the fossil record.\n\nOne characteristic that makes humans unique among extant mammals is that we\u2019re exclusively bipedal\u2014most of us (as adults, anyway) always walk on two feet. In the mid-20th century, the leading theory (a version of which Charles Darwin had laid out in 1871\u2019s The Descent of Man) posited that hominins evolved this way after their brains got larger and they started using tools. To put it very simply, walking upright leaves your hands free to hold things.\n\nBut during his first field season in Hadar, Johanson unearthed fossils that could complicate this timeline: part of a tibia and two femur pieces that formed a knee joint at an angle, much like a modern-day human\u2019s. Its age was ballparked at 3 million years, and its size suggested that the being it belonged to stood only a few feet tall. This could mean hominins were bipedal before big brains entered the picture.\n\nAll walking aside, what kind of hominin was this? An early Homo species\u2014or something else?\n\nFound Family\n\nThe plot thickened during the team\u2019s next dig at Hadar in 1974, which produced three hominin jaws and then, miraculously, Lucy.\n\nLucy's remains at an exhibition at the Houston Museum of Natural Science in 2007. / Dave Einsel/GettyImages\n\nLucy was so special because she was so intact: hundreds of bones and parts of bones that made up some 40 percent of a skeleton. Her large pelvic opening identified her as female, and the shape of her pelvis and legs confirmed that she walked upright. She was about 3.5 feet tall and at least 3 million years old (now dated at nearly 3.18 million), with a small brain and a jaw notably smaller than the others found there. Because of this and other discrepancies between Lucy and those jaws, Johanson guessed that she belonged to one previously unknown species, while the jaws belonged to another.\n\nBut further findings would cause him to change his tune. One was the 1975 discovery of an entire group of hominin skeletons, nicknamed the \u201cFirst Family,\u201d in Locality 333. \u201cFossils seemed to be cascading, almost as from a fountain, down the hillside,\u201d Johanson wrote. \u201cA near-frenzy seized us as we scrambled madly to pick them up.\u201d Another was the discovery of fossils in Laetoli, Tanzania, by a team led by Mary Leakey not long after that.\n\nDetermining the scientific relationship between all these fossils consumed Johanson and his collaborator Tim White in the summer of 1977. Though Lucy proved especially baffling due to her small teeth, the paleoanthropologists eventually attributed the anomaly to sexual dimorphism: differences in appearance between males and females of one species. At roughly 3.5 feet tall and likely tipping the scales at around 60 pounds, Lucy was the most diminutive adult female in the whole collection, and her teeth showed it. The largest of the bunch measured 5 feet tall and could have been as heavy as 150 pounds.\n\nIn the end, they concluded that everything from Laetoli and Hadar belonged to a single species that, as Johanson explained, \u201cstood somewhere between apes and humans and appeared to be neither one nor the other.\u201d Their brains were fairly proportional to chimps\u2019 brains, their arms hung a little lower than ours, and their faces were apish. But they ambled along more or less like we do. Johanson and White decided to categorize them in the genus Australopithecus, established by Raymond Dart after his 1924 discovery of a hominin fossil known as the Taung child\u2014also somewhere between ape and human (though Australopithecus loosely translates to \u201csouthern ape\u201d). For a species name, they settled on afarensis as a nod to the Afar region.\n\nLucy in the Rearview\n\nAs the oldest and most complete hominin skeleton at the time of her discovery, Lucy became the poster child for Australopithecus afarensis and the unofficial mother of all humans. But her legacy is much more nuanced than that, especially in light of all the fossils excavated in the decades after hers was.\n\nFor one thing, we now know that A. afarensis wasn\u2019t the origin point of bipedalism: Evidence suggests that other hominins\u2014including the 4.4-million-year-old Ardipithecus ramidus, the 6-million-year-old Orrorin tugenensis, and maybe even the 6-to-7-million-year-old Sahelanthropus tchadensis\u2014walked upright long before Lucy lived (though they likely did spend time in trees). This reinforces that bipedalism wasn\u2019t a product of brain enlargement, and it may have predated tool use, too: The earliest tools we\u2019ve found so far are only 3.3 million years old.\n\nWhy hominins began walking erect remains a subject of debate. According to one hypothesis, it could have arisen from males\u2019 need to carry food to their childrearing mates. Others believe shrinking forests meant more time traversing grasslands, which was more energy-efficient on two feet than four. Still others think hominins actually became bipedal in order to better navigate life in trees.\n\nAnother of Lucy\u2019s ambiguities is how she\u2019s related to us. Other hominins that lived around A. afarensis\u2019s time have since been uncovered, from fellow Australopithecus species like A. anamensis and A. deyiremeda to Kenyanthropus platyops (though it has been suggested that the solitary fossil found in that last species is just another afarensis relic). It\u2019s commonly thought that Australopithecus begot Homo, whose earliest fossil to date\u2014part of a jaw found in the Afar region in 2013\u2014is between 2.75 and 2.8 million years old. Lucy\u2019s species prevails as a popular possibility for Homo\u2019s direct ancestor.\n\n\u201cWe have now found afarensis in Tanzania, Chad, Kenya and Ethiopia, and we know Lucy and her kin must have lived in these parts of Africa for close to a million years. That antiquity and extensive geographical spread convince me that it is the most likely candidate to have given rise to the many species of the Homo genus and ultimately to our own species, Homo sapiens,\u201d paleoanthropologist Zeresenay Alemseged told The Guardian in June 2024. That said, it\u2019s far from a certainty.\n\nDonald Johanson, founding director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University, faces specimen AL 822-1, a reconstructed skull of an \u2018Australopithecus afarensis.\u2019 / Julesasu, Wikimedia Commons // Public Domain\n\nBut Lucy\u2019s influence transcends genealogy: She also ignited an unparalleled level of public interest in paleoanthropology. Back in the \u201970s, when Johanson told a Paris customs agent that the \u201cfunny little parcels\u201d in his suitcase were fossils from Ethiopia, the man lit up. \u201cYou mean Lucy?\u201d he said. \u201cA large crowd gathered and watched as Lucy\u2019s bones were displayed, one by one, on the Customs counter,\u201d Johanson recounted. \u201cI got my first inkling of the enormous pull that Lucy would generate from then on.\u201d Naturally, this pull was even stronger within the scientific community.\n\n\u201cOne of the major impacts of Lucy\u2019s discovery was that it encouraged so many scientists to go out and survey and explore for more fossils like Lucy,\u201d paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie said at a 50th-anniversary symposium earlier this year. Lucy wasn\u2019t the end of our hunt for humankind\u2019s origin\u2014she was just the beginning.\n\nRead More Exciting Stories About Human Origins:"

An emerging industry of expedition tourism, however, is laying open the thrill of discovery to the general public, with companies offering expert-led tours with a focus on subjects such as science, conservation and anthropology.\n\n\"People don't just want to sit on a beach anymore \u2013 there's more of an appetite for self-fulfilment,\" said Kevin Currie, director of New Scientist Discovery Tours. \"We launched in June 2019, at a time when experiential tours were growing at twice the rate of normal tourism. That's resumed since the pandemic; we're seeing exponential growth.\"\n\nNew Scientist Discovery Tours are accompanied by experts in their fields, who lead visits to conservation areas, historical sites or scientific institutions, explaining to guests in depth what it is that they're seeing and experiencing. Current tours include a trip to CERN in Switzerland with a particle physicist, and a cruise to Svalbard featuring on-board lectures from world-famous evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins."

We\u2019re so close,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard says she is officially joining the Republican Party.\n\nGabbard ran for the Democratic nomination in 2020, but broke from the party and has endorsed Trump.\n\nShe says during an appearance at his rally in North Carolina that Trump is \u201cour best and only hope in this election.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump chief of staff John Kelly says the former president \u2014 his former boss \u2014 \u201ccertainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.\u201d Speaking to the New York Times, Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, told the paper that Trump \u201ccertainly prefers the dictator approach to government.\u201d\n\nThey marked the former top aides\u2019 most extended public comments about the former Republican president and the party\u2019s 2024 nominee for the White House. Kelly declined to endorse any candidate for the White House, but told the paper, \u201cit\u2019s a very dangerous thing to have the wrong person elected to high office.\u201d\n\nTrump is lashing out at former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, who has been campaigning with Kamala Harris in a bid to appeal to Republican voters who are uneasy about Trump.\n\nTrump says of Cheney that \u201cher father brought years of war and death to the Middle East.\u201d He was referring to former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served under President George W. Bush.\n\nHe asserted that Harris would do poorly in Michigan for aligning with Cheney.\n\n\u201cWhy would a Muslim or why would an Arab want to vote for someone that has Liz Cheney as her hero,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump has a long history of Islamophobic rhetoric, including, at one point, calling for a ban on Muslims entering the country during his 2016 campaign.\n\nEminem welcomes former President Barack Obama to the stage in Detroit as the Detroit rapper\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself\u201d plays.\n\nTrump in a campaign rally is focusing heavily on border security and claiming that illegal immigrants are taking jobs from African Americans and Hispanic Americans.\n\nEconomic data shows Black and Hispanic unemployment at the lower end of recent decades. In September, the unemployment rate stood at 5.7% for Blacks and 5.1% for Hispanics, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe unemployment rates for both populations have plummeted since the pandemic.\n\nJust before the pandemic, the unemployment rate for African Americans was 5.6% in December 2019 and 4.2% for Hispanics that same month.\n\nTrump says that Madison Square Garden isn\u2019t the only big city mega rally he\u2019s hoping to hold as he closes out his third campaign for the White House.\n\nHe says his staff are looking at booking big arenas in Atlanta as well as Philadelphia, after his event in liberal Manhattan this coming Sunday.\n\nTrump is also waxing nostalgic that his campaigning days are coming to a close.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad because we\u2019re sort of wrapping it up,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re wrapping up something that has been incredible.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cIt\u2019s been great to be with you and now we want to close it out with a beautiful bang.\u201d\n\nTrump has said that, regardless of what happens, he does not plan to run again - though he has been known to change his mind.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign is seizing on President Joe Biden saying \u201clock him up\u201d in reference to Trump during an appearance in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden just admitted the truth: he and Kamala\u2019s plan all along has been to politically persecute their opponent President Trump because they can\u2019t beat him fair and square,\u201d said Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, calling on Harris to \u201ccondemn Joe Biden\u2019s disgraceful remark.\u201d\n\nBiden, during his appearance, had been casting Trump as a threat to Democracy when he made the remark.\n\n\u201cPolitically lock him up,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cLock him out, that\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d\n\nTrump has routinely blamed Biden for the indictments against him, though there is no evidence the president had anything to do with them.\n\nTrump is portraying the nation\u2019s economy as in shambles during a campaign stop in Greensboro, N.C. He claims that \u201cwith four more years of Kamala Harris, North Carolina will be an economic wasteland.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s in contrast to a CNBC study earlier this year that named North Carolina as the second best state to do business, and it\u2019s been in the top three of CNBC\u2019s survey for five years in a row.\n\nThe state\u2019s Department of Commerce says that since 2017, North Carolina has announced more than 115,300 jobs and promised capital investments of $53.45 billion. Major projects have been announced by companies including Apple, Toyota and Wolfspeed.\n\nTrump is kicking off his rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, by asking his audience if they\u2019re better off now than they were four years ago. And he\u2019s going after Harris, calling her the country\u2019s worst-ever vice president and \u201ca radical left lunatic.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s calling the country \u201ca failing nation\u201d and saying this election \u201cis a choice between whether we will have four more years of incompetent failure and disaster, or whether we\u2019ll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of you. We\u2019re going to work together\u201d\n\nTrump is urging those who were displaced by Hurricane Helene to visit his campaign\u2019s website to see how they can vote.\n\nTrump\u2019s team and Republicans have backed a series of modifications to make it easier for those in the state to vote, despite having railed against changes so that people could more safely vote during the pandemic.\n\nHe says his supporters need to make the election \u201ctoo big too rig.\u201d\n\nTrump is speaking to supporters at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, saying he\u2019s seen a lot of the state lately and has followed the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump began his rally complaining that the state\u2019s residents \u201chaven\u2019t had much help from our government in Washington. I can tell you that.\u201d\n\nHe says that following Jan. 20th, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be seeing a lot of me. We\u2019re going to fix it up and make it better than ever.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Telemundo, Harris said she will help construct an economy that \u201csupports the working class.\u201d\n\nThe Spanish-language news channel spoke to Harris in English, but her interview was dubbed into Spanish for listeners. In response to claims by Donald Trump that she\u2019s a socialist, she said she was a \u201ccapitalist. A pragmatic capitalist.\u201d\n\nAnd she said she would focus on bringing capital to community banks to help Latino men get small business loans\n\nHarris says she still believes Joe Biden is \u201ccapable in every way\u201d of being president, after his disastrous debate against Trump forced him to abandon his reelection campaign, clearing the way for her to become the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News, Harris says \u201cyou\u2019d have to ask him if that\u2019s the only reason why\u201d he dropped out of the race, but that she has \u201cno reluctance\u201d in saying he\u2019s up for the job.\n\nHarris says she\u2019s not going to \u201cget into those hypotheticals\u201d about potentially pardoning Trump if she wins the White House. Trump has been convicted in a New York hush money trial and faces federal charges over his role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAsked if she thought pardoning Trump would help the country move on, she says, \u201cLet me tell you what\u2019s going to help us move on. I get elected President of the United States.\u201d\n\nHarris tells NBC News she doesn\u2019t believe that religious exceptions should be granted as Democrats look to restore a national right to abortion. Harris says she\u2019s not \u201cgoing to engage in hypotheticals\u201d about negotiations with Congress, but appears to reject having a carve-out for providers with a religious objection to providing abortions. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be making concessions when we\u2019re talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body,\u201d she says.\n\nHarris says she\u2019s not focused on pointing out the historic nature of her candidacy. She tells NBC News: \u201cI\u2019m clearly a woman, I don\u2019t need to point that out to anyone.\u201d\n\nHarris would be the first woman elected to the White House if she wins. She says she\u2019s not worried about sexism harming her candidacy, saying she\u2019s focused on speaking to all voters.\n\n\u201cI will never assume that anyone in our country should elect a leader based on their gender or their race, instead that that leader needs to earn the vote based on substance and what they will do to address challenges and to inspire people,\u201d she said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris says that if elected she will be more focused on lowering costs for American families than President Joe Biden.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News, Harris says: \u201cMine will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. I bring my own experiences, my own ideas to it, and it has informed a number of my areas of focus.\u201d She added that those focus areas are on \u201clowering costs.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden has laid into his predecessor, Donald Trump, declaring during a visit to New Hampshire that the former president is a \u201cgenuine threat to democracy.\u201d\n\nBiden gave a speech focused on prescription drug prices but used the end to suggest that world leaders are terrified of a second Trump term. He said they often pull him aside at summits and quietly wonder what a Trump return to the White House will do to democratic rule around the world.\n\nBiden got so wrapped up in his criticism that he declared at one point of Trump, \u201clock him up,\u201d echoing similar calls that some supporters make at the rallies of Vice\n\n\u201cPolitically lock him up,\u201d Biden continued over applause from attendees. \u201cLock him out, that\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d\n\nRecord numbers of people are voting early, driven partly by a surge of Republicans convinced to do so by Donald Trump. Trump previously turned his party off voting early with his election lies, but he\u2019s changed direction this year and now encourages it.\n\nThe early vote doesn\u2019t tell you who\u2019s going to win an election. You just know who\u2019s casting a ballot, not who they\u2019re voting for. Wait until Election night to find that out.\n\n\u25b6 Meanwhile, you can see who\u2019s voting in your state here.\n\nBiden veered into talking about the election as he closed his prescription speech in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cFolks, there\u2019s so much at stake so please call your neighbors, get your friends, get your relatives,\u201d the president said, urging people to vote in the presidential election.\n\nBiden made veiled references to Trump when he said that every world leader he meets pulls him aside to tell him they don\u2019t want Trump to win.\n\n\u201cIf America walks away, who leads the world? Who?\u201d Biden asked his audience.\n\nBiden is criticizing Trump on the issue of health care, specifically the former president\u2019s attempts to unravel the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe president is in Concord, New Hampshire, to talk about prescription drug savings under the Inflation Reduction Act he signed into law.\n\nBiden noted that Trump recently said he has \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d when he was asked about his plans for health care in the United States.\n\nSaid Biden of Trump, \u201cHe has no concept of anything. No plan.\u201d\n\nFlorida-based voter advocacy group Equal Ground launched its Pastors at the Polls community initiative intended to ensure voter safety throughout the final leg of this year\u2019s election season.\n\nCommunity pastors in Florida will receive various training sessions including poll monitoring and de-escalation training. Then, over the final two weekends of early voting, they\u2019ll be deployed and stationed at precincts across the state with higher voter intimidation risks.\n\nThe 2024 election marks the first presidential since three major voter suppression laws have gone into effect. Florida is one of several states where Republicans have enacted voting restrictions that created or enhanced criminal penalties and fines for those who assist voters. A federal judge blocked portions of a Florida measure earlier this year, including the one targeting felons and those who are not citizens.\n\nEven so, the law initially had a direct effect on the operations of Equal Ground and other voter advocacy organizations in the state before the ruling.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama tells a Wisconsin audience \u201cyou\u2019d be worried if grandpa was acting like\u201d Donald Trump.\n\nCampaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris, Obama honed in on Trump\u2019s actions at some of his rallies as well as calling himself the \u201cfather of IVF,\u201d or in vitro fertilization.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what that means. You don\u2019t either,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObama said to the crowd when it comes to Trump that they would call up their brother or cousin, and ask \u2019have you noticed?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is coming from somebody who wants unchecked power,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo, Wisconsin, we do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails. America is ready to turn the page.\u201d\n\nTim Walz campaigning in Wisconsin is mocking billionaire Elon Musk for his appearance at a campaign rally for Donald Trump, saying \u201cElon\u2019s on that stage jumping around, skipping like a dipsh\u2014\u2014t on the stage. You know it.\u201d\n\nThe Madison audience roared its approval in response.\n\nWalz said Musk is \u201cliterally the richest man in the world, spending millions of dollars to help Donald Trump buy an election.\u201d\n\nHe asserts that Musk is doing so because Trump has \u201calready promised that he would put Elon in charge of government regulation that oversees the businesses that Elon runs.\u201d Trump has said he would create a government efficiency commission to audit the entire federal government, an idea suggested by Musk, who would lead it\n\n\u201cWe had a nice road trip instead,\u201d Obama said to laughs from the crowd.\n\nThe drive from Chicago to Madison takes around three hours. Obama took the stage about two hours after the rally started.\n\nDemocratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz preceded Obama, along with a host of Wisconsin candidates and officeholders.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a person familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to confirm the taping.\n\nTrump and Rogan have a complicated history. While the two shook hands and spoke briefly at a UFC fight, Trump criticized Rogan after he said that then-candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. was the only one running who made sense to him.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA2024,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site in August.\n\nBoth Trump and Harris have appeared on a slew of popular podcasts \u2014 with Trump\u2019s typically aimed at young men.\n\n\u2014 Jill Colvin\n\nThe webpage provides information for voters in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, who may be confronting lost identification, relocated polling places or other disruptions because of the hurricanes.\n\nThe Justice Department has compiled information about changes states have made to aid those affected by the storms. The page answers questions such as how people who\u2019ve been displaced can get a ballot mailed to their new location and how residents can check to see if the place where they usually cast their ballot is open for voting.\n\nGroups in Russia created and helped spread viral disinformation targeting Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, a senior U.S. intelligence official said Tuesday.\n\nThe content, which includes baseless accusations about the Minnesota governor\u2019s time as a teacher, contains several indications that it was manipulated, said the official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nAnalysts identified clues that linked the content to Russian disinformation operations, said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the office of the director.\n\nDigital researchers had already linked the video to Russia, but Tuesday\u2019s announcement is the first time federal authorities have confirmed the connection.\n\nThe disinformation targeting Walz is consistent with Russian disinformation seeking to undermine the Democratic campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz, her running mate. Russia also has spread disinformation aimed at stoking discord and division ahead of voting, officials said, and may seek to encourage violent protests after Election Day.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Russian disinformation.\n\nThe participants gathered around Trump with their hands on his shoulders. Trump remained seated and had his eyes closed.\n\nThey asked God to continue to protect Trump and give him strength. And to \u201cmake America godly again.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that switching to all-electric trucks would require rebuilding every one of the country\u2019s bridges and that solar fields kill rabbits.\n\nHe says he recently saw a solar field \u201cthat looked like it took up half the desert.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all steel and glass and wires. And it looks like hell,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see rabbits, they get caught in it.\u201d\n\nTrump often rails against wind power, saying the turbines \u201ckill all the birds\u201d and confuse whales. He\u2019s been more complimentary of electric cars since he received the backing of Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nBut he is criticizing their range and weight at an event with Latino supporters Tuesday, claiming the nation would need to rebuild every one of its bridges if truck fleets swap diesel for electric vehicles to handle the extra weight.\n\nHe called it a \u201cbad thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you imagine somebody doing that? That\u2019s the enemy. I guess that maybe is the enemy from within,\u201d he said, repeating the phrase he\u2019s used in recent speeches to refer to Democratic lawmakers such as U.S. Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff.\n\n\u201cWe just can\u2019t stand for this incompetence anymore.\u201d\n\nThe FBI said Tuesday that it\u2019s investigating the unauthorized release of these documents.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO, Bob Unanue, is a vocal supporter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite good out of the can,\u201d Trump says of the company known for its beans and other products.\n\n\u201cI eat it whenever I can,\u201d he claims.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama will also be there.\n\nSpringsteen will hold another concert with Obama on Monday in Philadelphia.\n\nA senior campaign official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said more concerts will be announced in the coming days.\n\n\u2014 Chris Megerian\n\nAt the event, Trump said Harris is \u201cslow\u201d and has a \u201clow IQ.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need another low IQ person,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not what you want.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s jabs come after Harris tried to cast him as \u201cexhausted\u201d after he pulled out of several interviews \u2014 though Trump has had a busy schedule of interviews with conservative outlets and podcasts.\n\nIn the opening remarks, notable Florida Republicans including Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott proclaimed Trump\u2019s record in supporting the Hispanic community during his previous term.\n\nSuarez was one of three Florida Republicans running for president in the earlier campaign cycle, but despite running against Trump, the mayor endorsed the former president in March. Suarez said that under Trump\u2019s term, Hispanics experienced the lowest unemployment and the biggest reduction in poverty.\n\nScott, who\u2019s running for reelection, emphasized Trump would be the best to handle Latin American conflicts and fight against dictatorial regimes, where the families of many voters in the crowd escaped from.\n\nMiami is home to one of the largest Hispanic communities in the country, with about 70% of Miami-Dade County\u2019s population identifying as Hispanic according to 2023 Census data.\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful day in Miami, with blue skies framing the property\u2019s many palm trees.\n\nScott\u2019s main message to Hispanic voters was that under Trump\u2019s presidency, Hispanic voters were better off, because the border was more secure and inflation was lower.\n\nScott is saying Harris\u2019 policy will institute price controls, which is socialism. He said her administration would raise taxes.\n\n\u201cThe Hispanic vote is the deciding factor. If you want someone to fight for Latin America, Trump\u2019s going to do it,\u201d Scott said.\n\nWhen Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and Kamala Harris jumped in, a cascade of Zoom meetings with hundreds of thousands of participants popped up seemingly out of nowhere and helped propel her to the Democratic nomination.\n\nNow organizers are trying to turn that burst of digital enthusiasm into traditional get-out-the-vote efforts like phone banking and door knocking. They\u2019ve created a loose constellation of volunteer networks operating independently of the Harris campaign, all geared toward marshaling local or online communities behind the vice president.\n\nPeople are sending postcards, texting friends, canvassing battleground states, making friendship bracelets with campaign messages, and sometimes surprising themselves by getting involved in ways they\u2019ve never done before.\n\nThe question is whether the Zoom meetings that drew so much attention during the summer \u2014 for Black women, Black men, white women, white dudes, cat ladies, Taylor Swift fans and more \u2014 will turn out to be a short-lived phenomenon or a powerful catalyst for Harris to beat Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Zoom organizing by Democrats.\n\nBut she\u2019s not necessarily trying to sway voters there. She\u2019s trying to highlight a make-or-break issue for Democrats: abortion rights.\n\nHarris will seek to show how Texas\u2019 restrictive abortion ban is creating increasing medical distress for women. During her campaign, the Democratic presidential nominee has often highlighted the increasingly perilous landscape for women since the fall of Roe, and she links it to Donald Trump, who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned the landmark abortion rights ruling.\n\nBut it\u2019s unusual for her to do it from a state she\u2019s highly unlikely to win. Campaign officials say the plan is a nontraditional way to capture the attention of voters in battleground states who are inundated with campaign ads and run-of-the-mill campaign events.\n\nBut Harris also thinks the issue is resonating with Republican voters, too, particularly women.\n\nPennsylvania is arguably the hardest fought of the battleground states and happens to have one of the fastest-growing Hispanic communities in the country, in what is known as the 222 Corridor, after the highway that connects small cities and towns west and north of Philadelphia.\n\nIt\u2019s fertile ground for both Democrats and Republicans to test their strength among Latinos in a state where small margins decide who gets 20 electoral votes. It\u2019s a place where Democratic nominee Kamala Harris can prove that her party still commands a large share of the demographic\u2019s support, and where Republican Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has been working to gain ground.\n\n\u201cThis is the epicenter for Latino voters in Pennsylvania,\u201d said Victor Martinez, who is of Puerto Rican descent and lives in and broadcasts his show from Allentown. \u201cI like the fact that Kamala Harris has to keep sending people over here to listen to us and talk to us. I like it. I like the fact that JD Vance has to keep coming back. I like it, because that means that they have to pay attention to us.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s Latino-eligible voter population has more than doubled since 2000 from 208,000 to 579,000, according to the Latino Data Hub from the University of California, Los Angeles\u2019 Latino Policy & Politics Institute. The population in cities like Allentown and Reading is now more than half Hispanic, with a majority being of Puerto Rican descent and a sizable portion of Dominican origin.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the Latino vote in this election.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration is awarding $428 million for 14 clean-energy manufacturing projects in Pennsylvania and other states hit hard by the decline of the U.S. coal industry.\n\nOne of the larger grants, $87 million, will go to a Pennsylvania company to make state-of-the-art linear generators at a plant outside Pittsburgh, a key battleground in the presidential election.\n\nLinear generators can use any fuel source to produce low-carbon power for utilities, data centers and industry. Mainspring Energy plans to use Energy Department funds to create enough electricity annually to power more than 40,000 homes. Harris, like Biden, has pledged to help workers displaced by the transition to clean energy, a key issue in energy-rich Pennsylvania.\n\nTwo weeks out from Election Day, the crisis in the Middle East is looming over the race for the White House, with one candidate struggling to find just the right words to navigate its difficult cross-currents and the other making bold pronouncements that the age-old conflict can quickly be set right.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has been painstakingly \u2014 and not always successfully \u2014 trying to balance talk of strong support for Israel with harsh condemnations of civilian casualties among Palestinians and others caught up in Israel\u2019s wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, for his part, insists that none of this would have happened on his watch and that he can make it all go away if elected.\n\nBoth of them are bidding for the votes of Arab and Muslim American voters and Jewish voters, particularly in extremely tight races in the battleground states of Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the Mideast conflict\u2019s role in the election.\n\nFor the past year, Project 2025 has endured as a persistent force in the presidential election, its far-right proposals deployed by Democrats as shorthand for what Donald Trump would potentially do with a second term at the White House.\n\nEven though the former president\u2019s campaign has vigorously distanced itself from Project 2025, the sweeping Heritage Foundation\u2019s proposal to gut the federal workforce and dismantle federal agencies aligns closely with his vision. Project 2025\u2019s architects come from the ranks of Trump\u2019s administration and top Heritage officials have briefed Trump\u2019s team about it.\n\nIt\u2019s rare for a complex 900-page policy book to figure so dominantly in a political campaign. But from its early start at a think tank, to its viral spread on social media, the rise and fall and potential rise again of Project 2025 shows the unexpected staying power of policy to light up an election year and threaten not only Trump atop the ticket but down-ballot Republicans in races for Congress.\n\nThrough it all, Project 2025 hasn't gone away. It exists not only as a policy blueprint for the next administration, but as a database of some 20,000 job-seekers who could staff a Trump White House and administration and a still unreleased \u201c180-day playbook\u201d of actions a new president could employ on Day One.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Project 2025.\n\nIn-person early voting kicks off Tuesday across battleground Wisconsin, with former President Barack Obama and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz hosting a rally in liberal Madison and Republicans holding events to encourage casting a ballot for Donald Trump before Election Day.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin by just under 21,000 votes in 2020, an election that saw unprecedented early and absentee voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are expecting another razor-thin margin in Wisconsin and both sides are pushing voters to cast their ballots early.\n\nTrump was highly critical of voting by mail in past elections, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud. But this election, he and his backers are embracing all forms of voting, including by mail and early in-person. Trump himself encouraged early voting at a rally in Dodge County, Wisconsin, earlier this month.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about early voting in Wisconsin.\n\nHarris is set to discuss how her plan will lower costs, increase their chances for homeownership and expand job opportunities for Latino men in an interview she\u2019s taping Tuesday in Washington with Telemundo, the Spanish-language TV network.\n\nThe campaign says Harris, running mate Tim Walz and her husband, Doug Emhoff, are giving interviews to several Hispanic media outlets this week in a bid to get her message across to Latino men.\n\nHarris\u2019 Telemundo interview is set to air Wednesday night."

In this dynamic environment, investors might find it prudent to monitor quality cybersecurity stocks like Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP), Trend Micro Incorporated (TMICY), and Radware Ltd.

The fiscal 2025 proposal also directs $3 billion to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), reflecting a $103 million increase over its current budget.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s analyze the fundamentals of the above-mentioned three Software \u2013 Security stocks, beginning with #3.\n\nStock #3: Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.
