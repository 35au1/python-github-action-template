Learn more \u203a\n\nIt sounds insane, but I know what I saw\u2014a UFO. Or, I think it was. Too many people have drones these days, so I guess it could\u2019ve been anything. Alas, I was sitting on my porch, enjoying my new pair of night vision binoculars, when I saw something moving in the dark. It was too fast for it to be a plane.\n\nI can see over 1,300 feet away with these bad boys, and, boy, I saw something alright. A flying saucer\u2014or a UAP as the kids call it these days. Better yet? My binoculars have a built-in camera and I started recording. Can you believe they were only $84.97 (reg. $169.99)?\n\nSeeing is believing, and you need these to see\n\nWanna know how I know that UFO was real? My footage didn\u2019t save. The binoculars work; I have dozens of 36MP photos and 4K videos of tweety birds from my backyard. But those aliens? They wiped my darn UAP pictures. Those suckers. This is all I\u2019ve got:\n\nAt least I got to see them in the flesh. I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t wipe my memory (yet). The cool thing about these binoculars, compared to night vision goggles, is that I don\u2019t have to squint through uncomfortable eyepieces to get a glimpse at some aliens\u2014just look through the 4.5-inch LCD screen. I can also use it to play videos back.\n\nThe only slightly annoying thing is that they have to be charged, which is obvious since they\u2019re digital. But a 4,000mAh rechargeable battery lasts me quite a few nights of bird-watching and now UFO hunting. I\u2019ll be waiting for my visitors to return.\n\nGrab yourself a pair of these digital binoculars with night vision and recording capabilities for only $84.97 (reg. $169.99) and save 50 percent. This price drop only lasts until February 23 at 11:59 p.m. PT.\n\nStackSocial prices subject to change.\n\n4K Night Vision Digital Binoculars with 8x Digital Zoom\n\nOnly $84.97 at Popular Science"

But this is an iconic piece of Scottish history which rightly deserves it place in a museum.\u201d\n\nMr Robinson said he has taken the trousers on exhibition tours and claimed to have turned down cash offers for them.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI\u2019ve been offered thousands of pounds by an American businessman but I have refused.\n\n\u201cI wanted to donate these trousers to the National Museums of Scotland. Sadly, they refused. I\u2019m very disappointed.\u201d\n\nBob said officials had apologised via email and said they \u201calready had similar material\u201d.\n\nA National Museums Scotland spokesman last night said this was a mistake but explained: \u201cWe are offered objects as donations to the National Collection all the time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have space or capacity to accept them all.\u201d\n\n6 National Museums Scotland said they don't want the trousers\n\n6 Mr Robinson is determined to preserve them for future generations."

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nThe Notes app built into Apple devices has long offered people a quick and convenient way to save lists, thoughts, and other random items. And while Apple initially shunned the bells and whistles found in the top note-taking apps, it has slowly beefed up Notes over time.\n\nIn 2024, Apple Intelligence added AI-powered enhancements in iOS/iPadOS 18.1 and 18.2 that can proofread, rewrite, and summarize your notes. You can also transcribe and summarize recordings of phone conversations, create images from text using Image Playground, or turn your rough sketches into professional images with Image Wand.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple Intelligence is only available on the newest Apple devices, and tips number 17 through 24 on this list require it; more on that below.\n\n1. Add a Quick Note\n\nIn a hurry? Start a Note from the Control Center. On a device running iPadOS 15+ or iOS 16 and up, go to Settings > Control Center. In the More Controls section, tap the plus (+) icon next to Quick Note. To move it up the list, drag Quick Note by its hamburger icon under the Include Controls section.\n\nNow, when you need to create a Quick Note, swipe down from the top-right corner to access the Control Center. Tap the Quick Note icon (it looks like a box with a scribble) from the menu and type your note. Tap Save when finished, and that note is automatically saved in the Notes app.\n\nYou can also create a Quick Note from an app, such as a website in Safari, a link on a specific web page, or selected text on any screen. Open the app and content you want to save to a note, tap the Share icon, and select Add to Quick Note. You can then add additional text to your note. When done, tap Save.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Lock a Note With iPhone Passcode or Password\n\nWith iOS 16 and iPadOS 16 or higher, you can protect a note through a custom password, your device passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID. To do this, open the ellipsis menu in the note and choose Lock. Keep in mind that to view the locked note on another device, it will also need to be running iOS/iPadOS 16 or higher.\n\nOnce a note is locked, you'll need to authenticate your identity to unlock it again. Select the note in question and tap the View Note link. Authenticate the note with your chosen security method, and the note will reappear on the screen.\n\n3. Switch to Gallery View\n\nWhen in List view, your notes appear by default in descending order with a title and the first few words visible. However, you can change the view by tapping the ellipsis icon in the app and selecting View as Gallery. Notes will then be shown as thumbnail images that display the name, part of the text in the note, and any photos that might be in the note (unless it's locked). Return to list view by tapping the ellipsis icon and selecting View as List.\n\n4. View All Attachments\n\nWant to see all the photos and attachments stored in your Notes app? Just tap the ellipsis icon and select View Attachments to open a window with all attached media.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Organize Your Folders\n\nThe Notes app lets you easily organize your folders and notes. Press down on a note or folder and drag it to a different location in the list. If you drag a folder onto another folder, it will turn into a subfolder. The new subfolder will then be hidden from view until you open the parent folder.\n\nYou can also change a folder into a subfolder by swiping the folder to the left and tapping the folder icon. To move a note, swipe it left, tap the folder icon, and then choose the new folder.\n\n6. Sort Notes in a Folder\n\nTo change the way notes are sorted within a folder, open the folder, tap the ellipsis icon, and select the Sort by option. By default, all notes are sorted by the last date edited, but you can sort by date created or title instead and further sort them by oldest to newest or newest to oldest (or by A-Z or Z-A, if you sort them by title).\n\n7. Share Notes and Folders\n\nYou can share notes and folders with others, and even give them view or edit permissions. You can also create a new folder specifically for sharing. Swipe the folder you wish to share to the left and tap the blue Sharing icon (or tap the ellipsis icon at the top, and select Share Note).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTap Only invited people can edit, then choose whom you want to have access to the folder\u2014only invited people or anyone with the link. Decide if you want other people to make changes or only view the folder and its notes, and if you want people to be able to share it with others. You can then share the folder via text, email, another app, or direct link.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor individual notes, tap the Share icon in the upper right then use the drop-down menu to decide if you want to send someone a copy of the note or a link to the actual note to collaborate on it. Choose how and with whom you want to share the note and send the invitation.\n\n8. Tag Your Notes\n\nIf you have iOS/iPadOS 15 or higher, you can add hashtags to notes anywhere in the text or title in order to better organize them. Just type # followed by the word you want to use as a tag, then select the word as it appears in quotes above the keyboard to create your tag. It can't contain spaces, but it does support hyphens or underscores.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve created a tag, you can use it in another note just by typing the # symbol and selecting the tag as it appears above the keyboard. To add an existing tag to multiple notes, tap the ellipsis icon and choose Select Notes. Tap all the notes you want to tag, choose the tag option at the bottom of the screen, and select the tag you want. A Tags section will appear on the main Notes screen, where you can view all tagged notes or all notes with a specific tag.\n\n9. Create Smart Folders\n\nYou can create smart folders based on your tags and other criteria. Such folders change to automatically include any notes to which you add a specific tag. At the main Notes screen, tap the folder icon in the bottom left to create a folder and name it. Choose Make Into Smart Folder and select the filters you want to apply. When finished, tap Done. Your new folder then appears with all the notes using that tag. Whenever you create a new note and use that tag, it is added to this folder.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n10. Send a Copy of a Note to an App\n\nYou can send a copy of a note to another app. For example, you could send a note to a file service such as Google Drive or Dropbox to store it as a separate text file. To do this, press down on the note and select Share Note from the pop-up menu, then just select the app to which you want to send the copy.\n\n11. Create a Checklist\n\nYou can use Notes as a to-do list app by creating a checklist of items. Open a note and tap the checkmark icon. A circle appears for the first item on your checklist. Type the entry and tap the Return key to create another circle and repeat the process as needed. Swipe an entry to the right to turn it into a sub-item. After you\u2019ve completed one of the tasks, tap its circle to show it as completed. The first time you do this, you\u2019re asked if you want completed items to move to the bottom.\n\n12. Scan a Document or Photo\n\nYou can scan a document or photo to incorporate it into a note. Create a new note or open an existing one, tap the ellipsis icon, and select Scan. Allow the scan to run, and the scanned image is added to your note.\n\n14. Mark Up Scanned Items\n\nWith iOS/iPadOS 17 or higher, you\u2019re able to mark up scanned PDFs and images. Open the note and tap that item, then select the markup icon in the lower right and choose a drawing tool. You can press down on the tool to change the thickness and shape of it. Tap the color wheel to choose a specific color. You can then mark up the scanned item as needed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n15. Add Links in Notes\n\nWith iOS/iPadOS 17 or higher, you can add links to your notes\u2014and those links can be to a web page or even to another note. To add a link, open a note, highlight the text (or press down on any empty area of the note), and select Add Link from the menu. Under the Link To section, add the URL or name of the note to be linked, then tap Done. You can then tap the link in the note to open the associated web page or note.\n\n16. Draw Text With an Apple Pencil\n\nThe Notes app works with the Apple Pencil in iPadOS 14 and higher to offer a Scribble option that converts your handwriting into editable text. Compatible iPad models include the iPad Pro, iPad (6th generation and later), iPad mini (5th gen and later), and iPad Air (3rd gen and later). To try it, just start scribbling characters in a note, and your handwriting will be converted to text.\n\nWith iPadOS 18 or higher, you can also use an Apple Pencil to turn your messy handwriting into legible text. And with an Apple Pencil Pro and an M2 iPad Air or M4 iPad Pro, you can change the current palette tool and perform other tricks by squeezing the top barrel of the pencil, hovering the tip of the pencil over a note, and switching between the current tool and eraser by double-tapping the barrel.\n\nApple Intelligence\n\nApple Intelligence works on the iPhone 15 Pro and up, iPads and Macs with an M1 chip and up, and the A17 Pro iPad mini. Those devices need to be running at least iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, though more recent versions add more features. (We're currently up to iOS 18.3, which turns Apple Intelligence on by default.) Go to Settings > General > Software Update and make sure you\u2019re running the latest version of the OS on your iPhone or iPad. You\u2019ll be told that your OS is up to date or see a prompt to download the update. Here are a few ways Apple Intelligence can help you in the Notes app.\n\n17. Use AI to Proofread a Note\n\nTo proofread a note for spelling and grammatical errors, tap the Writing Tools icon on the toolbar and select Proofread. Tap the down arrow to accept a change or choose Use Original to stick with your original words. Tap Original to view the text without the changes and select it again to see the changes. Choose Revert to go back to the original text. When finished, tap Done.\n\n18. Use AI to Rewrite a Note\n\nMaybe you want to revise a note you\u2019ve written. Tap the Writing Tools icon and select Rewrite. The AI analyzes and then rewrites the note. Don\u2019t like the changes? Tap Rewrite again to generate additional versions of the text. Tap one of the arrow keys to switch between the different versions. If you\u2019re still unhappy with the revisions, select Revert to go back to your original text. Otherwise, tap Done.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nYou can also choose a specific style for revising your note. In the Writing Tools window, select Friendly, Professional, or Concise depending on the style you wish to apply. Tap Revert or Original to go back to the original version and Done to accept the changes.\n\n19. Summarize a Note With AI\n\nApple\u2019s Writing Tools can also summarize a note. To try it, select the text you want to use, then tap Writing Tools > Summary. The tool summarizes the text in a concise format. To see a summarized list instead, pick Key Points at the Writing Tools screen. The tool displays the key points of the content in a bullet-point layout.\n\n20. Format a Note as a List or Table With AI\n\nYou can reformat any text to display it as a list or table. This works best with a text document that contains sortable information. To try this, select the text, and choose Writing Tools. Pick List to reformat the text into a bulleted list or Table to place the text into a table with multiple rows and columns.\n\n21. Use ChatGPT With Writing Tools\n\nOn supported devices, ChatGPT can help write a note. In a blank new note, tap Writing Tools > Compose > Compose with ChatGPT, then type or dictate a description of the note that you want created. You can then review, refine, and rewrite the draft and add further details to it. When finished, tap Done.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n22. Transcribe and Summarize Phone Calls With AI\n\nLooking to record a phone call? You can now use AI to transcribe and summarize phone conversations in the Notes app. To do this, you'll need to tap the Recording icon in the upper-left corner of the screen while you're on a phone call. Tap Continue, and a message announces that the call will be recorded.\n\nTo review the recording in Notes, tap the notification at the top or just open the note in the Notes app. You may automatically see a written transcript of the call. If not, tap the Transcript icon in the lower left to view the transcript of the recording. Tap Summary at the top of the screen to view an AI-generated summary of the call.\n\n23. Use Image Playground to Create Images in a Note\n\nWith the Image Playground, you can generate images in a note based on the surrounding text. To try this, view an existing note with text, then open the tool palette and select the Image Wand (the one that looks like a wand with black stem and colored tip). Draw a circle on the note near the text and a few versions of an image are generated, based on what's written. Swipe through each version; when you find one you like, tap Done to add it to the note.\n\n24. Use the Image Wand to Turn Your Sketches Into Images\n\nThe Image Wand is also able to transform your rough sketches and doodles into accomplished artwork. To do this, open the palette toolbar in a note, select one of the pen or pencil tools, and draw a rough sketch. Now, select Image Wand from the palette and draw a circle around the sketch. At the prompt, type a description of the image you want, tap Done, and an image based on your sketch and description is created. Swipe through the different versions and choose the version you want."

            "article_content": "DeepSeek: What lies under the bonnet of the new AI chatbot?\n\n14 hours ago Andrew Duncan\n\nGetty Images\n\nTumbling stock market values and wild claims have accompanied the release of a new AI chatbot by a small Chinese company. What makes it so different?\n\nThe release of China's new DeepSeek AI-powered chatbot app has rocked the technology industry. It quickly overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free iOS app in the US, and caused chip-making company Nvidia to lose almost $600bn (\u00a3483bn) of its market value in one day \u2013 a new US stock market record.\n\nThe reason behind this tumult? The \"large language model\" (LLM) that powers the app has reasoning capabilities that are comparable to US models such as OpenAI's o1, but reportedly requires a fraction of the cost to train and run.\n\nAnalysis Dr Andrew Duncan is the director of science and innovation fundamental AI at the Alan Turing Institute in London, UK.\n\nDeepSeek claims to have achieved this by deploying several technical strategies that reduced both the amount of computation time required to train its model (called R1) and the amount of memory needed to store it. The reduction of these overheads resulted in a dramatic cutting of cost, says DeepSeek. R1's base model V3 reportedly required 2.788 million hours to train (running across many graphical processing units \u2013 GPUs \u2013 at the same time), at an estimated cost of under $6m (\u00a34.8m), compared to the more than $100m (\u00a380m) that OpenAI boss Sam Altman says was required to train GPT-4.\n\nDespite the hit taken to Nvidia's market value, the DeepSeek models were trained on around 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs, according to one research paper released by the company. These chips are a modified version of the widely used H100 chip, built to comply with export rules to China. These were likely stockpiled before restrictions were further tightened by the Biden administration in October 2023, which effectively banned Nvidia from exporting the H800s to China. It is likely that, working within these constraints, DeepSeek has been forced to find innovative ways to make the most effective use of the resources it has at its disposal.\n\nReducing the computational cost of training and running models may also address concerns about the environmental impacts of AI. The data centres they run on have huge electricity and water demands, largely to keep the servers from overheating. While most technology companies do not disclose the carbon footprint involved in operating their models, a recent estimate puts ChatGPT's monthly carbon dioxide emissions at over 260 tonnes per month \u2013 that's the equivalent of 260 flights from London to New York. So, increasing the efficiency of AI models would be a positive direction for the industry from an environmental point of view.\n\nWatch DeepSeek AI bot respond to question about China\n\nOf course, whether DeepSeek's models do deliver real-world savings in energy remains to be seen, and it's also unclear if cheaper, more efficient AI could lead to more people using the model, and so an increase in overall energy consumption.\n\nIf nothing else, it could help to push sustainable AI up the agenda at the upcoming Paris AI Action Summit so that AI tools we use in the future are also kinder to the planet.\n\nWhat has surprised many people is how quickly DeepSeek appeared on the scene with such a competitive large language model \u2013 the company was only founded by Liang Wenfeng in 2023, who is now being hailed in China as something of an \"AI hero\".\n\nThe model is constructed from a group of much smaller models, each having expertise in specific domains\n\nThe latest DeepSeek model also stands out because its \"weights\" \u2013 the numerical parameters of the model obtained from the training process \u2013 have been openly released, along with a technical paper describing the model's development process. This enables other groups to run the model on their own equipment and adapt it to other tasks.\n\nThis relative openness also means that researchers around the world are now able to peer beneath the model's bonnet to find out what makes it tick, unlike OpenAI's o1 and o3 which are effectively black boxes. But there are still some details missing, such as the datasets and code used to train the models, so groups of researchers are now trying to piece these together.\n\nNot all of DeepSeek's cost-cutting techniques are new either \u2013 some have been used in other LLMs. In 2023, Mistral AI openly released its Mixtral 8x7B model which was on par with the advanced models of the time. Mixtral and the DeepSeek models both leverage the \"mixture of experts\" technique, where the model is constructed from a group of much smaller models, each having expertise in specific domains. Given a task, the mixture model assigns it to the most qualified \"expert\".\n\nDeepSeek has even revealed its unsuccessful attempts at improving LLM reasoning through other technical approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search, an approach long touted as a potential strategy to guide the reasoning process of an LLM. Researchers will be using this information to investigate how the model's already impressive problem-solving capabilities can be even further enhanced \u2013 improvements that are likely to end up in the next generation of AI models.\n\nGetty Images Modified versions of Nvidia's H100 GPUs were used by DeepSeek to train its LLM (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nSo what does this all mean for the future of the AI industry?\n\nDeepSeek is potentially demonstrating that you don't need vast resources to build sophisticated AI models. My guess is that we'll start to see highly capable AI models being developed with ever fewer resources, as companies figure out ways to make model training and operation more efficient.\n\nUp until now, the AI landscape has been dominated by \"Big Tech\" companies in the US \u2013 Donald Trump has called the rise of DeepSeek \"a wake-up call\" for the US tech industry. But this development may not necessarily be bad news for the likes of Nvidia in the long term: as the financial and time cost of developing AI products reduces, businesses and governments will be able to adopt this technology more easily. That will in turn drive demand for new products, and the chips that power them \u2013 and so the cycle continues.\n\nIt seems likely that smaller companies such as DeepSeek will have a growing role to play in creating AI tools that have the potential to make our lives easier. It would be a mistake to underestimate that.\n\n--\n\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week."

            "article_content": "DeepSeek has made Indian companies rethink AI model development, shifting focus from just applications to potential foundational models.\n\nDeepSeek has earned recognition from major tech companies, and even US President Donald Trump described China\u2019s achievement as a \u201cpositive\u201d development and a wake-up call for the American AI industry.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing it has done is just change the belief that foundational models are only for large tech companies. DeepSeek has shattered that feeling,\u201d said Sandeep Dutta, Chief Practice Officer\u2013Asia-Pacific & Middle East region, Fractal.\n\nIn a related development, Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Thursday that the government has created a framework calling for proposals to develop the country\u2019s own foundational AI model. He also stated that at least six developers, startups, and teams would be building a foundational model within 4-10 months.\n\nLLM race\n\nExperts are debating whether India needs its own large language model (LLM), given that China has firmly entered the global AI race and is challenging the dominant US players.\n\nIndian startups like Sarvam and Krutrim are making significant strides in the development of LLMs tailored to the local market and diverse languages.\n\nAI startup Sarvam, which raised around $41 million in 2023, focuses on building language models that can understand and generate in multiple Indian languages.\n\nBhavish Aggarwal-led Krutrim is working on region-specific AI models that can enable businesses to interact with customers in their native language, integrating contextual and cultural understanding.\n\nTailored applications\n\n\u201cThe DeepSeek moment is a reminder that accepting the status quo is a wrong strategy,\u201d said Narendra Bhandari, General Partner, Seafund. He emphasised that AI should be seen as a solution rather than just software, and that India\u2019s investment in massive Nvidia GPU purchases is a necessary first step.\n\nBruce Keith, Co-Founder and CEO of InvestorAi, said that innovations like DeepSeek are shifting the focus from processing power to data and application-specific models. \u201cDeepSeek has proven that game-changing innovations don\u2019t need billion-dollar investments. This democratises AI and offers countries like India an opportunity to leap ahead without extensive infrastructure,\u201d Keith explained.\n\nDutta pointed out that India\u2019s strength lies in creating applications suited to local needs, such as in agriculture, healthcare, and finance. \u201cInstead of focusing on a single, large foundational model, India can develop smaller, domain-specific models tailored for key sectors,\u201d he said. This approach could make India a global leader in AI applications.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s strength is not necessarily in building foundational models but in creating applications. People don\u2019t buy models, they buy applications,\u201d said Jaspreet Bindra, managing director of Tech Whisperer.\n\nStartup ecosystem\n\nReferring to how DeepSeek\u2019s lower cost of building models offers startups in India a unique advantage, Anil Kumar, CTO of Exotel, said, \u201cWe\u2019re at a critical moment. The AI landscape is shifting, and models are becoming cheaper to build and run. Now, the value is in building real-world applications rather than just focusing on hardware.\u201d This shift is giving rise to a new wave of AI application-first startups, he added.\n\nOn the ahead , Bindra pointed to the lack of patient capital in India\u2019s venture capital ecosystem, which traditionally expects quick returns. \u201cAI models require long-term investments. In India, we need to rethink our funding strategies to foster innovation.\u201d\n\nHe noted that India would have to focus on research as well as foster an ecosystem for deeptech startups, including funding for the sector.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

            "article_content": "Uncanny (4x60) is made by BBC Studios Specialist Factual Productions, the award-winning department behind RTS Award winning Fight The Power, Grierson and Broadcast Award winning Inside Our Autistic Minds with Chris Packham, Freedom: 50 Years of Pride, and Lucy Worsley Investigates. It was commissioned by Jack Bootle, Head of Commissioning, Specialist Factual. The Executive Producer for BBC Studios is Alan Holland. Rhian Roberts is the Commissioning Editor for the Uncanny podcast.\n\nDanny Robins is the host and writer of hit BBC Sounds / Radio 4 podcast Uncanny. He\u2019s also the creator of BBC Sounds podcasts The Battersea Poltergeist and The Witch Farm, and the writer of the award-winning West End play 2:22 \u2013 A Ghost Story. Assisting Danny in his investigations are sceptic Dr Ciar\u00e1n O\u2019Keeffe and parapsychologist Evelyn Hollow, who pick apart the details of each case to work out what might have happened. Danny also invites viewers to get in touch with their own explanations, and he provides case updates which explore viewers\u2019 theories on the stories.\n\nWere three generations of a farming family in rural Lancashire all terrorised by the presence of a small child? Did a group of charity shop workers all witness the same paranormal figure? Were a teenager and his friends preyed upon by a towering malign presence in the 90s? And was a young girl physically pushed down the stairs by a supernatural force in the early 2000s?\n\nDo ghosts exist? Are you Team Believer or Team Sceptic? Danny Robins investigates real-life stories of seemingly paranormal encounters. In the second season of the hit TV series, based on the successful BBC Sounds / BBC Radio 4 podcast, Uncanny is back on BBC Two and iPlayer. Featuring a brand new crop of terrifying real-life stories of potentially supernatural encounters told by the people they happened to - experiences that seem to defy logical explanation. Or do they? In each of the four episodes, Danny Robins investigates a different case and tries to help those involved understand what happened to them. Can their experiences be explained \u2013 or are they really evidence of something supernatural?\n\nWhat can you tell us about the new series of Uncanny?\n\nThis series is bigger, bolder, scarier, and more intriguing than ever before. The cases we feature scare me, so they will definitely scare you! They are really unsettling with bizarre frightening moments that happen in the most ordinary, normal settings. It's truly chilling because if these experiences can happen to ordinary people like those we feature, then it can happen to anyone!\n\nThe first case takes place in a classic ghost story setting on a farm in the middle of nowhere, with a very normal, sensible and rational scientific guy, Liam, who is too frightened to go upstairs in his parents\u2019 home because of what he experienced there. We find out that his mum and his dad have also experienced really strange, frightening things in that same house and it's just so intriguing!\n\nWe have also got a case set in a shop with a bunch of colleagues who don\u2019t know each other very well but are all experiencing genuinely terrifying, potential poltergeist activity and apparitions. Another episode features Julian, who to this day is still frightened by what happened to him, and there's an uncertainty in his case about whether he is making contact with someone he lost or something malicious that is out to do him harm. Our final case features a very normal family who have very abnormal things happen in their home; it's a case that takes us into a level of threat that is almost higher than anything else we've experienced on Uncanny.\n\nUncanny is unique and different to traditional paranormal shows. I think it is probably the first time that sceptics and believers have come together and enjoyed these kinds of cases in their own way. If you're a sceptic it's a \u2018howdunit\u2019, and if you're a believer it's a \u2018whodunit\u2019. You can get together and enjoy the story on your own terms and talk to your friends about it; discussing that biggest of all questions: Do ghosts exist?\n\nWhat is new and different about this series?\n\nWe have a very different spread of people in this series; different ages, personality types and very different locations as well. We've got homes, we've got workplaces, we've got people who experience things in childhood, people who experience things as adults, families that experience it together and people who experience it with mates or colleagues, so it's a real spread! It really dispels the idea that there is a certain type of person that sees a ghost or a certain type of place where you're likely to see a ghost. These stories can happen to anybody!\n\nWe've got some brilliant experiments featuring in the series too, for example sending me into a wind tunnel at 90 miles an hour to test a theory about whether convection currents - drafts in houses - can cause poltergeist activity. I had things flying towards my head at 90 miles an hour so that was quite something! We also go to Hampton Court Palace and I go around testing whether electromagnetic frequencies could explain the hauntings there. We also have me in a graveyard, checking whether people might hallucinate spectres by a sudden coming together of fog and lights. So it\u2019s quite an unusual show from that point of view. I don't think there's anything else quite like Uncanny on television. You've got all the excitement and adrenaline-fuelled thrills and scares of the ghost story but you've also got the journalistic rigour and scientific integrity of stress testing the theories.\n\nWhat reaction did you get following the success of the last series?\n\nAfter last series I did a tour around the country and so many people came up to me and said, \"Thank you for talking about this subject\u201d and \u201cWhy haven't we talked about this subject more before?\" For a long time the topic of the paranormal was treated as slightly pantomime entertainment, but the idea of really properly looking at this subject and trying to work out if it's real, what is really going on, hasn\u2019t really been done before. A lot of people have felt compelled to come forward and tell their stories, they feel Uncanny has created a safe space to talk about this subject. People who have never told their friends, never even told their partner, feel it's okay to talk to us about this and put themselves out there. I love that aspect of it.\n\nThe Uncanny fan base has also grown so much and now encompasses everyone from seven-year-olds to people in their 90s. I know families that sit down and watch Uncanny together, and that\u2019s wonderful. The Uncanny community of people who go off and do their own research, do their digging between episodes and send us their questions and theories is such a huge part of the show.\n\nWhat volume of stories get sent to you and how do you decide which ones to choose?\n\nIt\u2019s got to the point where it\u2019s gone kind of bonkers and there are thousands of stories coming in! I feel deeply privileged to receive each one, as they are all an amazing slice of someone's life. I love that people trust me with their stories.\n\nIt is very instinctive as to which stories we decide to tell; if I read a story and it makes me scared, and if it sends a shiver down my spine. I still think of myself as a sceptic who wants to believe but the thing that pushes me closest to \u2018belief\u2019 is sitting opposite somebody and hearing the tremble in their voice, seeing that look in their eyes and realizing they're still scared. It's often those stories that begin with \u201cI don't believe in ghosts, but I think I might have seen a ghost\u201d. I love that complete discombobulating life-changing confusion that something that you do not believe in, that you fundamentally don't want to accept, may have happened to you.\n\nHas your stance on being a sceptic or a believer changed at all since the last series or are you still \u2018a sceptic that wants to believe\u2019?\n\nI think I am still \u2018a sceptic who wants to believe\u2019. I've been on a journey, if you listen to the early podcasts you hear a more sceptic me, but I've not yet had that experience that pushes me over the edge. I feel like I live vicariously through the people who tell me their stories. I'd love to see a ghost, but I also feel very scared by that idea, and I think be careful what you wish for. I don't know if I'm brave enough to go through what these people have gone through.\n\nI also think it's important to keep a foot in both camps. I think Uncanny would be very different if I was a fully signed up card-carrying believer. I enjoy being torn. I love hearing our sceptic expert Ciaran\u2019s explanations and I think many of them are very convincing, and I also love Evelyn pulling me in the direction of belief. I view them as a little angel and devil on my shoulder, pushing and pulling me in different directions and hopefully the audience feel like that as well.\n\nI think if there's one message that Uncanny puts out there, it's that it\u2019s okay to not be sure; you can change your mind, or you can keep an open mind. We're encouraged all the time these days, particularly on social media, to stick to one opinion and to hate anybody who doesn't agree with you, but it\u2019s great that we can agree to disagree in this programme. We've got people who are incredibly polarised in their opinions coming together and enjoying it in their own way, agreeing to disagree and maybe changing their mind, or maybe not. I just think that's such an important thing, the idea that you can listen without judgment, respect somebody for their experiences and take home from it what you want; view it in your own way and treat it as a detective story on your own terms.\n\nIs winter the perfect time of year for ghost stories?\n\nThe winter has always been a time associated with ghost stories. The idea of telling stories around a campfire and that little thrill of the shiver down your spine that you feel at this coldest time of year. I think we are going to be delivering some truly chilling stories at this most chilling time of year. I just think there's no better time to listen to a ghost story than when you are curled up in your house, it's dark outside, there's a little chill in the air and you start to imagine it could all feel more real. There's a little bit more darkness, there's a few more shadows in the corner of your house!\n\nInterview with Dr Ciar\u00e1n O'Keeffe, Team Sceptic"

But this is an iconic piece of Scottish history which rightly deserves it place in a museum.\u201d\n\nMr Robinson said he has taken the trousers on exhibition tours and claimed to have turned down cash offers for them.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI\u2019ve been offered thousands of pounds by an American businessman but I have refused.\n\n\u201cI wanted to donate these trousers to the National Museums of Scotland. Sadly, they refused. I\u2019m very disappointed.\u201d\n\nBob said officials had apologised via email and said they \u201calready had similar material\u201d.\n\nA National Museums Scotland spokesman last night said this was a mistake but explained: \u201cWe are offered objects as donations to the National Collection all the time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have space or capacity to accept them all.\u201d\n\n6 National Museums Scotland said they don't want the trousers\n\n6 Mr Robinson is determined to preserve them for future generations."

            "article_content": "Penguins aren't the paragons of everlasting love that we often paint them out to be. In a megacolony of Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor), researchers in Australia have calculated a 'divorce' rate that is much higher than in humans.\n\nWhile many penguin species are considered socially monogamous, the idea that they choose mates for life and never even bat an eyelash at another is a common misconception.\n\nIt's true that Little Penguins on Phillip Island in Australia often find the same breeding partner from one year to the next. Yet even still, experts think divorce rates among bonded pairs can sometimes reach up to 50 percent.\n\nOver the course of 12 breeding seasons, scientists at Monash University counted nearly 250 'divorces' among a cohort of nearly one thousand paired penguins. That's roughly 21 break-ups a year between 2000 and 2013.\n\nTo put that in perspective, annual human divorce rates in the United States are about 2.4 marriages per thousand, which is nearly 10 times lower than in this species of penguin.\n\nThe whole megacolony on Phillip Island includes more than 37,000 Little Penguins, but researchers say their sample size is a good indication of what's going on more broadly.\n\nA penguin divorce was counted by researchers when a tagged penguin from the prior year's breeding season reappeared in the colony with a new mate.\n\nSimilar to our own species, a penguin's choice to leave or stay in a pair bond was often based on offspring.\n\n\"In good times, they largely stick with their partners, although there's often a bit of hanky-panky happening on the side,\" explains ecophysiologist Richard Reina from Monash, who has studied the island colony for 20 years.\n\n\"However, after a poor reproductive season they may try to find a new partner for the next season to increase their breeding success.\"\n\nLittle Penguins, as it turns out, aren't very faithful, and they aren't the only species destroying human illusions of unconditional 'love' in nature.\n\nWhile it's true that during breeding season, most penguin species pair up with the same mate as the year before, those bonds don't always last for life.\n\nEmperor penguins and Ad\u00e9lie penguins, for instance, often partake in 'extracurricular activities' even when they are paired, which means they aren't really sexually monogamous.\n\nOne study from 1999 found only 15 percent of Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) stay with the same partner for consecutive breeding seasons. Other penguin species have higher rates of social monogamy, reaching nearly 90 percent.\n\nLoyalty, it would seem, is a fickle beast that can change from species to species, year to year, and habitat to habitat.\n\nLast year, Monash University marine scientist Andre Chiaradia told the ABC that because climate change had the Little Penguins on Phillip Island breeding earlier, there was more time for infidelity.\n\n\"They finish earlier and think, 'Oh, I can have a second go',\" he said.\n\n\"Behind the scenes, they can have four to five partners in one night.\"\n\nChiaradia is an author on the newest paper, which finds that divorce rates among Little Penguins is the single most consistent factor for predicting the colony's reproductive success.\n\nIf the divorce rate stays low, at a baseline of about 18 percent, the breeding season is more likely to be successful.\n\nBut while divorce might be a sign of hard times, it's not always a bad choice in and of itself. In some cases, separation becomes a necessary risk, especially after a failed breeding season.\n\n\"Little penguins and other seabirds that prolong their pair bond over multiple seasons experience increased reproductive success over time,\" explains the research team from Monash.\n\n\"However, divorce may also be an adaptive tactic to increase longer-term reproductive success, especially when the previous breeding success was low, a higher-quality mate becomes available or usurps a lower-quality individual, or environmental events prevent or delay re-pairing.\"\n\nIt's all about weighing the short-term risks against the long-term benefits. Researchers at Monash say their findings show how important it is to consider social dynamics when it comes to animal conservation.\n\nThe study has been published in Ecology and Evolution."

            "article_content": "Two Columbus School District educators are recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.\n\nSuzy Zietlow, a third-grade teacher at the Discovery Charter School, and Mark Bussian, the district\u2019s instructional coach, have received the nation\u2019s highest honor for teachers of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\nThe two Columbus educators are among 336 educators around the country to receive the award.\n\nZietlow began her career at the Discovery Charter School in 2010.\n\n\u201cI started teaching second grade at Discovery Charter School and in 2012 I moved up to third grade,\u201d said Zietlow, who has a degree in microbiology and briefly did research before getting her teaching certificate from UW-Stevens Point.\n\nZietlow said she was nominated for the award by a friend who works for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction whom she had gone to conferences within the past.\n\n\u201cHe had seen what I did in my classroom and nominated me,\u201d Zietlow said, which started her on the application process in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn Discovery Charter School, we focus a lot on science and outdoor classroom work,\u201d Zietlow said. \u201cFor part of our culture, we have the regular math curriculum, and we follow a standards-based literacy curriculum, too, but whenever possible we are using science in those areas.\u201d\n\nStudents also are taken outside regularly to learn subjects with the help of their natural surroundings, Zietlow said.\n\nBussian has been the Columbus School District\u2019s instructional coach for the last year. He was the second-grade teacher at Token Springs Elementary School in Sun Prairie when he became a finalist for the award in 2022. Bussian said he was nominated by his principal there.\n\nBussian said he believes he was nominated for the award in part because of \u201cthe way I interact with students and look at different students\u2019 individual needs and the opportunities that I am able to give them instead of just a one size fits all approach. It is individualizing and personalizing and meeting them where they are at for their needs.\u201d\n\nHe focuses on helping all students to reflect on their learning and see where they are doing well, and where they need improvement, Bussian said.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, I am able to coach them up rather than be the person who is always in front of the class,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cIt is more an opportunity for them to learn everything based on the standards and learn from that.\u201d\n\nIn his new position in Columbus, Bussian said he likes working with a variety of different grade levels.\n\n\u201cI work with 4K all the way to high school teachers, and I am able to help them to work on best practices and things along those lines,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cI always say the teachers that I work with are the experts in their content area, and I am the one who can serve as a thought partner or can help with assessments or resources. If they have questions on why certain students might not be understanding concepts, then I\u2019m a sound board but also an extra set of eyes. I work very close with the teachers and that gives me a chance to work with a variety of students, too.\u201d\n\nWith the award, the two educators will receive $10,000 from the National Science Foundation, a certificate signed by the president and a trip to Washington, D.C. . While they are in Washington, they will participate in professional development activities and network with fellow STEM educators.\n\nBussian said they haven\u2019t been told a date yet for the trip to Washington.\n\nGALLERY: Columbus Fourth of July Parade fills the streets Columbus001.jpg Columbus002.jpg Columbus003.jpg Columbus004.jpg Columbus005.jpg Columbus006.jpg Columbus007.jpg Columbus008.jpg Columbus009.jpg Columbus010.jpg Columbus011.jpg Columbus012.jpg Columbus013.jpg Columbus014.jpg Columbus015.jpg Columbus016.jpg Columbus017.jpg Columbus018.jpg Columbus019.jpg Columbus020.jpg Columbus021.jpg Columbus022.jpg Columbus023.jpg Columbus024.jpg Columbus025.jpg Columbus026.jpg Columbus027.jpg Columbus028.jpg Columbus029.jpg Columbus030.jpg Columbus031.jpg Columbus032.jpg Columbus033.jpg Columbus034.jpg Columbus035.jpg Columbus036.jpg Columbus037.jpg Columbus038.jpg Columbus039.jpg Columbus040.jpg Columbus041.jpg Columbus042.jpg Columbus043.jpg Columbus044.jpg Columbus045.jpg Columbus046.jpg Columbus047.jpg Columbus048.jpg Columbus049.jpg Columbus050.jpg Columbus051.jpg Columbus052.jpg Columbus053.jpg Columbus054.jpg Columbus055.jpg Columbus056.jpg Columbus057.jpg Columbus058.jpg Columbus059.jpg Columbus060.jpg Columbus061.jpg Columbus062.jpg Columbus063.jpg Columbus064.jpg Columbus065.jpg Columbus066.jpg Columbus067.jpg Columbus068.jpg Columbus069.jpg Columbus070.jpg Columbus071.jpg Columbus072.jpg Columbus073.jpg Columbus074.jpg Columbus075.jpg Columbus076.jpg Columbus077.jpg Columbus078.jpg Columbus079.jpg Columbus080.jpg Columbus081.jpg Columbus082.jpg Columbus083.jpg Columbus084.jpg Columbus085.jpg Columbus086.jpg Columbus087.jpg Columbus088.jpg Columbus089.jpg Columbus090.jpg Columbus091.jpg Columbus092.jpg Columbus093.jpg Columbus094.jpg Columbus095.jpg Columbus096.jpg Columbus097.jpg Columbus098.jpg Columbus099.jpg Columbus100.jpg Columbus101.jpg Columbus102.jpg Columbus103.jpg Columbus104.jpg Columbus105.jpg Columbus106.jpg Columbus107.jpg Columbus108.jpg Columbus109.jpg Columbus110.jpg Columbus111.jpg Columbus112.jpg Columbus113.jpg Columbus114.jpg Columbus115.jpg Columbus116.jpg Columbus117.jpg Columbus118.jpg Columbus119.jpg Columbus120.jpg Columbus121.jpg Columbus122.jpg Columbus123.jpg Columbus124.jpg Columbus125.jpg Columbus126.jpg Columbus127.jpg Columbus128.jpg Columbus129.jpg Columbus130.jpg Columbus131.jpg Columbus132.jpg Columbus133.jpg Columbus134.jpg Columbus135.jpg Columbus136.jpg Columbus137.jpg Columbus138.jpg Columbus139.jpg Columbus140.jpg Columbus141.jpg Columbus142.jpg Columbus143.jpg Columbus144.jpg Columbus145.jpg Columbus146.jpg Columbus147.jpg Columbus148.jpg Columbus149.jpg Columbus150.jpg Columbus151.jpg Columbus152.jpg Columbus153.jpg Columbus154.jpg Columbus155.jpg Columbus156.jpg Columbus157.jpg Columbus158.jpg Columbus159.jpg Columbus160.jpg Columbus161.jpg Columbus162.jpg Columbus163.jpg Columbus164.jpg Columbus165.jpg Columbus166.jpg Columbus167.jpg Columbus168.jpg Columbus169.jpg Columbus170.jpg Columbus171.jpg Columbus172.jpg Columbus173.jpg Columbus174.jpg Columbus175.jpg Columbus176.jpg Columbus177.jpg Columbus178.jpg Columbus179.jpg Columbus180.jpg Columbus181.jpg Columbus182.jpg Columbus183.jpg Columbus184.jpg Columbus185.jpg Columbus186.jpg Columbus187.jpg Columbus188.jpg Columbus189.jpg"

This is tied to OpenAI\u2019s technology being proprietary, as opposed to an open source solution like DeepSeek that transparently explains how its technology works.\n\n\u201cWe are discussing [that],\u201d he answered. \u201cI personally think we have been on the wrong side of history here and need to figure out a different open source strategy. Not everyone at OpenAI shares this view, and it\u2019s also not our current highest priority.\u201d\n\nNormally, I would push that aside as a PR response to what\u2019s perceived as a crisis. But with AI changing so rapidly, and OpenAI being among the most chaotic and aggressive companies in this space, it\u2019s reasonable to believe that this will be a dramatically different company in the near future. We\u2019ve already seen Microsoft add the OpenAI o1 model\u2013which that company charges for\u2013to Copilot for free. I bet there are other major changes coming too."

            "article_content": "Minnesota's household wealth \u2014 mirroring national trends \u2014 has become more concentrated over the past six decades, a new database of household wealth.\n\nIn 1960, for instance, the bottom 50% of families owned about 10% of the state\u2019s total wealth, while the richest 1% had about 17%, according to data collected by Geowealth US.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut by 2010, the share of wealth owned by the bottom 50% fell by roughly half, while the wealth of the richest 1% more than doubled. Those shares changed little from 2010 to 2020.\n\nData by GEOWEALTH-US. Minnesota Reformer Graphic\n\nThe estimates in the database are based the federal Survey of Consumer Finances , which asks respondents about their assets and debts, as well as the Census\u2019 American Community Survey , which measures demographics, income and home ownership.\n\nBehind the numbers\n\nThe rise in wealth inequality is driven by many factors, including the loss of high-paying blue collar jobs; the growing concentration of white-collar jobs in coastal metropolitan areas and big advanced economies like the Twin Cities; and changes to the tax code favoring the already-wealthy.\n\nWealth inequality in the United States is greater than in most other democracies . Racial wealth disparities , driven in part by decades of discriminatory policymaking, are often staggering.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s racial disparities are among the worst in the nation , partly due to the state\u2019s long history of redlining , or denying mortgages and other financial services to non-white people. Those century-old policies reverberate in maps of neighborhood inequality made today.\n\nThe richest and poorest Minnesota communities are all concentrated in the Twin Cities metro.\n\nThe wealthiest communities in the Twin Cities are roughly 10 times richer than the poorest ones, according to the data.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis map by Geowealth US shows the approximate median household income across Minnesota. The map divided into Public Use Microdata Areas, which are census divisions containing at least 100,000 people. Researchers often analyze data at this geographic level in order to see variation within densely populated counties. Minnesota Reformer\n\nMedian households in parts of the west metro \u2014 including Lake Minnetonka, Plymouth and Maple Grove \u2014 have a net worth well over $400,000. Those in parts of south Minneapolis and the western part of St. Paul have closer to $40,000.\n\nIn the richest areas of the country, like Palo Alto or the New York City suburbs, the typical family is worth well over $1 million. In the poorest communities, which are in New York, Houston and Milwaukee, the typical family has only $18,000 in assets.\n\n\u201cPeople who grow up in wealthier places can reap benefits that span generations,\u201d Tom Kemeny, one of the database\u2019s compilers, explained in a recent commentary . \u201cAs a result of property taxes and philanthropy, wealthier communities have greater resources for schools, health care, transportation and other infrastructure.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story was originally published on MinnesotaReformer.com."

            "article_content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nThe Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has unveiled its 2024 report, marking a historic year for the organization and the nation\u2019s gaming industry. In a year characterized by rapid digital transformation and robust economic recovery, PAGCOR reported record-high revenues and net income figures that not only surpassed pre-pandemic levels but also set a new benchmark for growth.\n\nA Historic Financial Milestone\n\nAccording to the latest report, PAGCOR\u2019s annual revenue reached an unprecedented PHP 112 billion (approximately $1.92 billion), reflecting a remarkable 41% increase compared to the previous year. This significant surge is largely driven by the booming online gaming sector\u2014a testament to the evolving preferences of gamers and the increasing integration of technology in entertainment.\n\nBreaking down the revenue streams, the bulk of the earnings\u2014PHP 97.52 billion (around $1.67 billion)\u2014stemmed from gaming operations and license fees. Additional contributions came from business income and service fees, which added PHP 14.18 billion (roughly $240 million) to the overall figure. The detailed report shows that while licensed casino gaming contributed PHP 33.07 billion (about $570 million) and Casino Filipino venues added PHP 12.67 billion (nearly $220 million), online gaming emerged as a powerhouse with PHP 68.20 billion (approximately $1.17 billion), constituting 37.61% of the total revenue. Despite the discontinuation of Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations (POGOs) in December, these operations still generated PHP 2.99 billion (around $51 million) in revenue.\n\nThe net operating income also experienced robust growth, climbing to PHP 84.97 billion (approximately $1.45 billion) with a 51% year-on-year increase. After deducting the PHP 68.21 billion (around $1.17 billion) allocated for nation-building initiatives, PAGCOR\u2019s final net income stood at PHP 16.77 billion (roughly $290 million). This nearly doubled the net income reported in 2023, which was PHP 6.81 billion.\n\nExpanding Contributions to Nation Building\n\nBeyond its impressive financial performance, PAGCOR has substantially bolstered its contributions to national development. With a total of PHP 68.2 billion disbursed to government programs and initiatives, the agency has played a pivotal role in supporting a broad spectrum of socio-economic projects. Key allocations include PHP 46.32 billion (approximately $790 million) directed to the National Treasury, PHP 4.87 billion (around $83 million) in franchise taxes, and PHP 1.09 billion (nearly $19 million) in corporate income taxes.\n\nAdditional funds have been channelled to sports and socio-civic programs. The PAGCOR remitted PHP 2.31 billion (roughly $40 million) to the Philippine Sports Commission and allocated PHP 91.88 million (about $1.57 million) in cash incentives to successful athletes and trainers. Presidential socio-civic programs received PHP 12.37 billion (around $210 million), while cities hosting Casino Filipino properties, the Board of Claims under the Department of Justice, and the Renewable Energy Trust Fund were awarded PHP 698.6 million (approximately $11.96 million), PHP 178.8 million (around $3.06 million), and PHP 248.01 million (roughly $4.24 million), respectively.\n\nCEO Alejandro Tengco expressed gratitude to all stakeholders for their contributions to these outstanding results, particularly praising the rapid expansion of the online gaming sector. This growth, which underpins much of the record-breaking performance, highlights the increasing popularity of digital platforms and the transformative impact of technological innovations in the industry.\n\nIndustry Trends and the Digital Transformation\n\nThe continuous evolution of the e-games sector has not only redefined entertainment but also created new economic opportunities across the Philippines. The surge in online gaming reflects a broader trend seen globally, where digital platforms have become integral to the gaming experience. PAGCOR\u2019s strategic investments in technology and its agile response to market demands have positioned it well to capitalize on these emerging trends.\n\nFurthermore, PAGCOR has been proactive in integrating responsible gaming measures alongside its expansion initiatives. The organization\u2019s commitment to ensuring safe and secure gaming environments aligns with international best practices and contributes to sustainable growth in the sector.\n\nOverview of PAGCOR\u2019s Role and Future Outlook\n\nEstablished as a state-run entity, PAGCOR plays a dual role in regulating the gaming industry and driving socio-economic development through its contributions. The impressive financial figures of 2024 underscore not only the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic but also a forward-looking approach that leverages digital innovation and responsible gaming practices.\n\nAs the global gaming landscape continues to evolve, PAGCOR\u2019s strategic direction suggests that further integration of technology, coupled with robust regulatory frameworks and sustainable practices, will continue to propel the industry forward. The positive trends observed this year serve as a strong indicator of the potential for further growth and diversification in the Philippine gaming sector.\n\nProjections and Comparisons with Other SE Asian Countries\n\nStatista projects that the Asian online gambling market could hit USD 70 billion by 2025, with the Philippines capturing a significant share due to its relatively liberal laws compared to many of its neighbors. This dynamic environment has attracted a broader demographic, with estimates suggesting that about 30\u201340% of adult Filipinos participate in some form of gambling, particularly through digital channels.\n\nBy contrast, Singapore maintains a much more tightly controlled gaming market. In 2022, Singapore\u2019s integrated resorts, including Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa, reported combined revenues of SGD 3.8 billion (roughly USD 2.8 billion). However, the country\u2019s strict regulations\u2014such as mandatory entry fees for locals and a robust framework aimed at curbing problem gambling\u2014result in a lower domestic participation rate, estimated at around 5\u201310% of adults. This regulated approach ensures high revenues from international tourists while keeping local participation deliberately subdued, differing markedly from the broader engagement seen in the Philippines.\n\nMalaysia presents a nuanced picture. With legal gaming venues like Genting Highlands, Malaysia\u2019s casino sector generated approximately MYR 1.3 billion (around USD 300 million) in revenue in 2022. However, the market is naturally limited due to the country\u2019s dual legal system. While non-Muslim citizens have access to licensed gambling facilities, Malaysia\u2019s predominantly Muslim population adheres to religious guidelines that discourage gambling, resulting in an estimated participation rate of about 20% among eligible players. This scenario contrasts with the Philippines, where gambling is both culturally accepted and legally encouraged, leading to higher overall participation rates.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, nations such as Thailand and Indonesia adopt far more restrictive gambling policies. Thailand permits gambling only in state-sanctioned forms like lotteries and horse racing, leading to an estimated annual turnover of around USD 8 billion from largely unregulated activities, while official participation remains low. In Indonesia, where all forms of gambling are generally prohibited, illegal gambling networks reportedly involve several million individuals, yet official revenues are negligible. These stark contrasts highlight the Philippines\u2019 relatively open and lucrative regulatory environment, which fosters high participation and robust legal revenues, albeit with challenges in maintaining rigorous oversight. As we have previously reported, Thailand is looking to relax its gambling laws and start building casino projects that are expected to draw in a significant number of tourists.\n\nExploring Mega Dice: A Leading Crypto Casino for Responsible Gamblers\n\nFor the lovers of responsible gambling, Mega Dice stands out as one of the top online crypto casinos available today.

Bajaj discusses emerging trends, sustainability initiatives, and how Vinsak is leveraging automation and AI to stay ahead in the evolving printing and packaging industry.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a quick update on the state of the industry. How has your company fared in 2024?\n\n2024 has been a landmark year for us. One of our major milestones was the successful turnaround of Rotatek Printing and Packaging Technologies. Within just a year of acquisition, we sold three presses in Ireland, India, and the UAE.\n\nWhat achievements stand out for Vinsak this year?\n\nOur Vinsak label embellishment machine, Label-Decore, achieved its 125th installation this year. Another standout was the installation of the 880mm web width Invicta I2 press in Ahmedabad\u2014the largest and first of its kind in Asia.\n\nWhat\u2019s your outlook for 2025?\n\nIn 2025, we expect advancements in automation, increased demand for sustainable materials, and a growing focus on digital printing for personalisation and short-run production. Technologies like blockchain and enhanced security features will also gain traction.\n\nHow is Vinsak preparing for these trends?\n\nBoth Rotatek and Vinsak have made significant R&D investments to ensure our products keep our customers ahead of the curve.\n\nWhich has been your most popular press in the last 12 months?\n\nIn 2024, the Label-Decore machine was our most popular product, with its 125th installation reflecting the growing demand for premium labels.\n\nWhy is Label-Decore so popular?\n\nPackaging today is about more than just protection\u2014it\u2019s about engaging customers at first glance. Label-Decore is a modular machine for converting and label embellishments, making it highly versatile.\n\nHave you seen increased demand for other products?\n\nYes, we\u2019ve also seen increased demand for our Vinsak inkjet systems, driven by the rise in barcodes, QR codes, variable data printing, and personalisation features.\n\nThe industry is shifting towards digital printing. How is your company adapting?\n\nWe\u2019re investing in digital technologies while also offering hybrid solutions that combine digital and offset methods. This allows us to cater to both short-run and long-run printing needs.\n\nCan you give an example of a hybrid solution?\n\nThe new Brava 450 from Rotatek, currently under R&D, is designed to handle both types of prints efficiently. By integrating digital and traditional approaches, we\u2019re ensuring that offset printing remains relevant in niche markets like high-quality, large-volume prints.\n\nAccording to research, the global offset printing market is projected to grow modestly, while digital printing is expected to surge. Is this trend reflected in the Indian market?\n\nIn India, the growth rates for offset and digital printing align with global trends, though local factors like technological adoption and economic conditions play a role.\n\nIs there room for improvement in the offset printing market?\n\nWhile the 1.8% growth rate for offset is modest, there\u2019s potential for improvement through innovation, automation, and exploring new niches like high-end packaging.\n\nHow is Vinsak meeting the demand for shorter print runs and personalisation?\n\nWe\u2019ve focused on offering solutions like Vinsak Inkjet Systems for variable and personalised printing, as well as enhanced security features such as QR codes and connected packaging.\n\nSustainability is a growing concern. How is your company addressing this?\n\nWe\u2019re committed to sustainability through energy-efficient technologies, waste recycling, and the use of non-toxic, food-grade inks.\n\nHow do these practices benefit your customers?\n\nThese practices not only reduce our environmental impact but also improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness for our customers.\n\nHow is Vinsak leveraging automation and AI?\n\nIn 2024, key trends included increased automation, sustainability initiatives, and the adoption of digital technologies. We\u2019ve been proactive in integrating AI and IoT to optimise operations and meet the growing demand for personalised and secure packaging.\n\nCan you give an example of how AI is being used?\n\nOur Vinsak Inkjet Systems, for example, are designed to offer variable data printing and enhanced security features, keeping our clients ahead in the market.\n\nWhat are the latest innovations in offset technology?\n\nInnovations like tactile varnishes, soft-touch coatings, and advanced ink formulations are enhancing the sensory appeal of packaging.\n\nHow is Vinsak leading in this space?\n\nWe\u2019re exploring hybrid printing solutions that combine offset with digital techniques, allowing printers to cater to both high-volume and personalised jobs. Additionally, we\u2019re integrating smart packaging features like QR codes and NFC technology to create more engaging consumer experiences.\n\nWhat do you see as the key challenges and opportunities for the industry in the next five years?\n\nThe next five years will bring challenges like cost pressures, sustainability demands, and labour shortages, but also opportunities in personalisation, smart packaging, and hybrid printing.\n\nHow is Vinsak preparing for these challenges?\n\nAt Vinsak, we\u2019re addressing these challenges through significant R&D investments and expanding into new markets, including Saudi Arabia. Our machines are becoming more sustainable, and our focus on innovation ensures we\u2019re well-positioned to meet the evolving demands of the industry.\n\n"

Photo credit: David T.\n\nAs you approach Michael\u2019s, you might be forgiven for thinking you\u2019ve made a wrong turn.\n\nThe exterior is modest, to say the least.\n\nA simple white building with a burgundy awning bearing the restaurant\u2019s name in white lettering.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly screaming \u201cculinary hotspot\u201d from the rooftops.\n\nBut as any seasoned food lover knows, it\u2019s often the most unassuming places that hold the greatest treasures.\n\nStep inside, and you\u2019re transported to a world that feels frozen in time \u2013 in the best possible way.\n\nDecisions, decisions!

It\u2019s a plate that screams \u201ctreat yo\u2019 self!\u201d Photo credit: ben adams\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on their crab cakes.\n\nIn a city famous for its crab, Michael\u2019s manages to stand out from the crowd.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about their specials.\n\nOh boy, the specials.\n\nThey\u2019ve got a different one for each day of the week, and each one is like a little celebration on a plate.\n\nMonday nights?\n\nThat\u2019s when you can sink your teeth into a 24 oz.

Whole Steamed Maine Lobster for $28.95.\n\nIt\u2019s like a mini vacation to the coast of Maine, minus the long drive and the lobster traps.\n\nWednesday is for the indecisive food lovers among us.\n\nFor $25.95, you can get 2 Broiled Soft Lump Crabcakes AND a Whole Maine Lobster.\n\nIt\u2019s the culinary equivalent of having your cake and eating it too.\n\nThursday is when things get serious.\n\nA steak so good, it might just propose to you! This char-grilled beauty is ready for a long-term relationship with your palate. Photo credit: Charleston N.\n\nWe\u2019re talking Steak Night, people.\n\nA 40 oz. Prime Rib (yes, you read that right, FORTY OUNCES) for $25.95.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of meal that makes you want to cancel your plans for the next day because you\u2019ll be too busy basking in the afterglow of steak perfection.\n\nAnd Friday?\n\nWell, Friday is when you treat yourself to a 32 oz. Crab Cake for $34.95.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect way to kick off the weekend \u2013 with a crab cake so big it could probably qualify for its own zip code.\n\nBottoms up! This bar is stocked like a liquid library, with every spirit ready to tell its own intoxicating story.

This dining area feels like the cozy cabin of a luxury liner, minus the seasickness. Photo credit: David T\n\nThey\u2019ll regale you with stories of the restaurant\u2019s history if you let them, each tale more colorful than the last.\n\nSpeaking of history, Michael\u2019s has been serving up stellar steaks and seafood since 1980.\n\nThat\u2019s over four decades of culinary excellence, folks.\n\nIn restaurant years, that\u2019s practically ancient.\n\nBut like a fine wine, Michael\u2019s has only gotten better with age.\n\nThe restaurant has weathered changing food trends, economic ups and downs, and even the recent pandemic.\n\nWhere everybody knows your name\u2026 or at least your favorite cut of steak. Diners enjoying the warm, convivial atmosphere. Photo credit: Jay B.\n\nThrough it all, they\u2019ve stayed true to their roots, serving up consistently delicious food with a side of warm hospitality.\n\nNow, I know what some of you health-conscious readers might be thinking.\n\n\u201cBut what about my diet?\u201d\n\nWell, let me tell you something.\n\nSometimes, you need to treat yourself.\n\nAnd when you do, it should be somewhere special.\n\nSomewhere like Michael\u2019s.\n\nPull up a stool and stay awhile! This bar\u2019s got more character than a Dickens novel and twice the spirits. Photo credit: Michael Edwards\n\nBesides, they do have some lighter options on the menu.\n\nThere\u2019s grilled fish, salads, and even some vegetable sides that aren\u2019t drowning in butter.\n\nBut let\u2019s be real \u2013 you don\u2019t come to Michael\u2019s for a salad.\n\nYou come here to indulge.\n\nOne of the things that sets Michael\u2019s apart is their commitment to quality.\n\nThey\u2019re not trying to reinvent the wheel here.\n\nInstead, they\u2019re focused on doing the classics, and doing them exceptionally well.\n\nA bowl of liquid comfort! This chicken and rice soup looks like it could cure anything from a cold to a broken heart. Photo credit: Tamara M.\n\nTheir steaks are USDA Prime, which for the uninitiated, is the cream of the crop when it comes to beef.\n\nOnly about 2% of beef in the U.S. earns this designation.\n\nIt\u2019s like the valedictorian of the cow world.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget about their seafood.\n\nBeing in Baltimore, they have access to some of the freshest catches around.\n\nTheir crab comes straight from the Chesapeake Bay, and you can taste the difference.\n\nThe sea\u2019s finest on ice! These oysters are dressed up and ready to party on your palate. Photo credit: Monica Hall\n\nBut perhaps the most remarkable thing about Michael\u2019s is how it manages to feel both timeless and relevant.\n\nIn a world of constantly changing food trends and Instagram-worthy dishes, there\u2019s something refreshing about a place that knows exactly what it is and doesn\u2019t try to be anything else.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of restaurant where you can bring your grandparents, your boss, or your date, and everyone will find something to love.\n\nIt\u2019s equally suited for special occasions and \u201cjust because\u201d dinners.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying you should eat at Michael\u2019s every day.\n\nYour cardiologist might have a few words to say about that.\n\nThe Godzilla of seafood has arrived! This lobster is so impressive, it deserves its own action movie franchise. Photo credit: Valarie J.\n\nBut for those times when you want to treat yourself, when you want to experience a true Baltimore institution, or when you just really, really need a good steak \u2013 Michael\u2019s is the place to be.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself in Baltimore, do yourself a favor.\n\nSkip the trendy new spots with their deconstructed this and foam-infused that.\n\nInstead, head to Michael\u2019s Steak & Lobster House.\n\nOrder a steak, maybe splurge on some crab cakes, and prepare for a meal that\u2019ll have you planning your next visit before you\u2019ve even finished dessert.\n\nBecause in a world of culinary fads and fleeting food trends, Michael\u2019s stands as a testament to the enduring power of good food, done right.\n\nDeath by chocolate? Sign me up! This supreme chocolate cake looks sinfully delicious enough to be worth the risk. Photo credit: Hannah C.\n\nIt\u2019s more than just a meal \u2013 it\u2019s an experience.\n\nAn experience that\u2019ll leave you full, happy, and wondering why you don\u2019t eat like this more often.\n\nJust remember to bring your appetite \u2013 and maybe some stretchy pants.\n\nTrust me, you\u2019re going to need them.\n\nFor more information about Michael\u2019s Steak & Lobster House, including their full menu and hours of operation, be sure to visit their Facebook page.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re ready to experience this Baltimore institution for yourself, use this map to find your way to steak paradise.\n\nWhere: 6209 Eastern Ave, Baltimore, MD 21224\n\nLife\u2019s too short for mediocre meals.

            "article_content": "Two Columbus School District educators are recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.\n\nSuzy Zietlow, a third-grade teacher at the Discovery Charter School, and Mark Bussian, the district\u2019s instructional coach, have received the nation\u2019s highest honor for teachers of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\nThe two Columbus educators are among 336 educators around the country to receive the award.\n\nZietlow began her career at the Discovery Charter School in 2010.\n\n\u201cI started teaching second grade at Discovery Charter School and in 2012 I moved up to third grade,\u201d said Zietlow, who has a degree in microbiology and briefly did research before getting her teaching certificate from UW-Stevens Point.\n\nZietlow said she was nominated for the award by a friend who works for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction whom she had gone to conferences within the past.\n\n\u201cHe had seen what I did in my classroom and nominated me,\u201d Zietlow said, which started her on the application process in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn Discovery Charter School, we focus a lot on science and outdoor classroom work,\u201d Zietlow said. \u201cFor part of our culture, we have the regular math curriculum, and we follow a standards-based literacy curriculum, too, but whenever possible we are using science in those areas.\u201d\n\nStudents also are taken outside regularly to learn subjects with the help of their natural surroundings, Zietlow said.\n\nBussian has been the Columbus School District\u2019s instructional coach for the last year. He was the second-grade teacher at Token Springs Elementary School in Sun Prairie when he became a finalist for the award in 2022. Bussian said he was nominated by his principal there.\n\nBussian said he believes he was nominated for the award in part because of \u201cthe way I interact with students and look at different students\u2019 individual needs and the opportunities that I am able to give them instead of just a one size fits all approach. It is individualizing and personalizing and meeting them where they are at for their needs.\u201d\n\nHe focuses on helping all students to reflect on their learning and see where they are doing well, and where they need improvement, Bussian said.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, I am able to coach them up rather than be the person who is always in front of the class,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cIt is more an opportunity for them to learn everything based on the standards and learn from that.\u201d\n\nIn his new position in Columbus, Bussian said he likes working with a variety of different grade levels.\n\n\u201cI work with 4K all the way to high school teachers, and I am able to help them to work on best practices and things along those lines,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cI always say the teachers that I work with are the experts in their content area, and I am the one who can serve as a thought partner or can help with assessments or resources. If they have questions on why certain students might not be understanding concepts, then I\u2019m a sound board but also an extra set of eyes. I work very close with the teachers and that gives me a chance to work with a variety of students, too.\u201d\n\nWith the award, the two educators will receive $10,000 from the National Science Foundation, a certificate signed by the president and a trip to Washington, D.C. . While they are in Washington, they will participate in professional development activities and network with fellow STEM educators.\n\nBussian said they haven\u2019t been told a date yet for the trip to Washington.\n\nGALLERY: Columbus Fourth of July Parade fills the streets Columbus001.jpg Columbus002.jpg Columbus003.jpg Columbus004.jpg Columbus005.jpg Columbus006.jpg Columbus007.jpg Columbus008.jpg Columbus009.jpg Columbus010.jpg Columbus011.jpg Columbus012.jpg Columbus013.jpg Columbus014.jpg Columbus015.jpg Columbus016.jpg Columbus017.jpg Columbus018.jpg Columbus019.jpg Columbus020.jpg Columbus021.jpg Columbus022.jpg Columbus023.jpg Columbus024.jpg Columbus025.jpg Columbus026.jpg Columbus027.jpg Columbus028.jpg Columbus029.jpg Columbus030.jpg Columbus031.jpg Columbus032.jpg Columbus033.jpg Columbus034.jpg Columbus035.jpg Columbus036.jpg Columbus037.jpg Columbus038.jpg Columbus039.jpg Columbus040.jpg Columbus041.jpg Columbus042.jpg Columbus043.jpg Columbus044.jpg Columbus045.jpg Columbus046.jpg Columbus047.jpg Columbus048.jpg Columbus049.jpg Columbus050.jpg Columbus051.jpg Columbus052.jpg Columbus053.jpg Columbus054.jpg Columbus055.jpg Columbus056.jpg Columbus057.jpg Columbus058.jpg Columbus059.jpg Columbus060.jpg Columbus061.jpg Columbus062.jpg Columbus063.jpg Columbus064.jpg Columbus065.jpg Columbus066.jpg Columbus067.jpg Columbus068.jpg Columbus069.jpg Columbus070.jpg Columbus071.jpg Columbus072.jpg Columbus073.jpg Columbus074.jpg Columbus075.jpg Columbus076.jpg Columbus077.jpg Columbus078.jpg Columbus079.jpg Columbus080.jpg Columbus081.jpg Columbus082.jpg Columbus083.jpg Columbus084.jpg Columbus085.jpg Columbus086.jpg Columbus087.jpg Columbus088.jpg Columbus089.jpg Columbus090.jpg Columbus091.jpg Columbus092.jpg Columbus093.jpg Columbus094.jpg Columbus095.jpg Columbus096.jpg Columbus097.jpg Columbus098.jpg Columbus099.jpg Columbus100.jpg Columbus101.jpg Columbus102.jpg Columbus103.jpg Columbus104.jpg Columbus105.jpg Columbus106.jpg Columbus107.jpg Columbus108.jpg Columbus109.jpg Columbus110.jpg Columbus111.jpg Columbus112.jpg Columbus113.jpg Columbus114.jpg Columbus115.jpg Columbus116.jpg Columbus117.jpg Columbus118.jpg Columbus119.jpg Columbus120.jpg Columbus121.jpg Columbus122.jpg Columbus123.jpg Columbus124.jpg Columbus125.jpg Columbus126.jpg Columbus127.jpg Columbus128.jpg Columbus129.jpg Columbus130.jpg Columbus131.jpg Columbus132.jpg Columbus133.jpg Columbus134.jpg Columbus135.jpg Columbus136.jpg Columbus137.jpg Columbus138.jpg Columbus139.jpg Columbus140.jpg Columbus141.jpg Columbus142.jpg Columbus143.jpg Columbus144.jpg Columbus145.jpg Columbus146.jpg Columbus147.jpg Columbus148.jpg Columbus149.jpg Columbus150.jpg Columbus151.jpg Columbus152.jpg Columbus153.jpg Columbus154.jpg Columbus155.jpg Columbus156.jpg Columbus157.jpg Columbus158.jpg Columbus159.jpg Columbus160.jpg Columbus161.jpg Columbus162.jpg Columbus163.jpg Columbus164.jpg Columbus165.jpg Columbus166.jpg Columbus167.jpg Columbus168.jpg Columbus169.jpg Columbus170.jpg Columbus171.jpg Columbus172.jpg Columbus173.jpg Columbus174.jpg Columbus175.jpg Columbus176.jpg Columbus177.jpg Columbus178.jpg Columbus179.jpg Columbus180.jpg Columbus181.jpg Columbus182.jpg Columbus183.jpg Columbus184.jpg Columbus185.jpg Columbus186.jpg Columbus187.jpg Columbus188.jpg Columbus189.jpg"

Jan Balatka, Managing Director of Semantic Visions, brings nearly two decades of experience in consulting and AI leadership to this challenge. His expertise shapes the company\u2019s efforts to use advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and data-driven tools to help businesses tackle these issues head-on.\n\nUnderstanding Today\u2019s Challenges\n\nModern supply chains are under pressure from increasing regulations, globalization, and rapid technological change. \u201cThese challenges are creating difficulties not just for manufacturers but for every layer of the supply chain,\u201d says Balatka. Drawing from his years working with global businesses, he understands the critical need for solutions that provide visibility and control across supply networks. Semantic Visions addresses this by offering AI-powered tools that monitor risks and identify opportunities, even within often-overlooked lower tiers of the supply chain.\n\nHow Technology is Driving Change\n\nSemantic Visions employs a range of technologies to transform supply chain management:\n\nAI and Automation: Advanced AI models analyze structured and unstructured data, providing faster and more accurate decision-making. Balatka\u2019s background in AI leadership ensures these models meet the diverse needs of supply chain operations.\n\nGlobal Monitoring: Their system tracks over 13 million companies worldwide, scanning information in 12 languages to detect potential disruptions like financial instability or delays at ports.\n\nSeamless Integration: Using low-code/no-code platforms, Semantic Visions helps businesses connect legacy systems to modern tools, reducing inefficiencies\u2014a challenge Balatka frequently encountered in his consulting career.\n\nRemoving Barriers to Transformation\n\nDespite the benefits of digital tools, many businesses face challenges like limited IT resources and fragmented systems. \u201cSupply chain teams often have to compete with other departments for IT support,\u201d Balatka notes. His experience in working with resource-constrained organizations informs Semantic Visions\u2019 approach: start small by focusing on areas with the most significant impact and gradually expand efforts. Outsourcing IT resources or using AI tools to bridge language and time zone gaps can also help.\n\nThe Future of Supply Chains\n\nBalatka predicts that automation and the use of both software and hardware robots will play a key role in addressing labor shortages and improving efficiency. For companies just starting their digital transformation journey, he advises focusing on critical pain points and adopting widely used platforms for smoother transitions.\n\nA Practical Lesson in Supply Chain Management\n\nBalatka\u2019s experience in consulting often revealed how small oversights could have significant impacts. In one case, a client\u2019s packaging strategy led to inefficiencies, with single pens being shipped in oversized boxes\u2014wasting resources and driving up costs. By combining open-source intelligence (OSINT) data with AI, Semantic Visions enables companies to uncover similar inefficiencies that might otherwise go unnoticed. For example, their AI-driven tools can detect subtle supply chain disruptions, such as delays caused by specific suppliers or inefficient processes, by analyzing unstructured data from global sources. This ability to pinpoint overlooked details helps businesses refine their operations and avoid costly mistakes, ensuring greater efficiency throughout the supply chain.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nSemantic Visions aims to expand its reach and provide greater visibility into multi-tiered supply chains. \u201cOur goal is to help businesses understand their supply chains beyond the first tier,\u201d Balatka explains. By integrating his deep industry knowledge into Semantic Visions\u2019 strategy, Balatka is positioning the company to lead the digital transformation of supply chains worldwide.\n\nAs digital transformation accelerates, leaders like Balatka with Semantic Visions are paving the way for a more resilient and efficient supply chain industry."

After a chilly start, today was the warmest day since last December.\n\nThat huge jump in temperature was due to brisk south winds, low humidity, and plenty of sunshine. Typically, you add 20 degrees to the morning low to get the afternoon high. Today, you added 34 degrees.\n\nIt won't be as cold tomorrow morning, with upper 40s in most locations across North Texas.\n\nNothing but sunshine and way-above-normal temperatures to start the new month. Highs are expected to be between 15 and 22 degrees above normal for this time of year.\n\nOn Monday, we could draw close to a record high for the date, with two days this week potentially hitting the 80s. Looking back at the 126-year record, this has happened only five other times in the first week of February. If the forecast holds, this would be the warmest start to February in 114 years, with 1911 being the warmest start ever.\n\nIt'll be dry as well. The rainfall forecast looks bone dry for the next seven days.\n\nDon't expect this weather to last. It will feel like spring all week, but by the end of next weekend, the chill of winter will return.\n\nEnjoy the weather this week, it'll be a great week to spend time outdoors."

            "article_content": "Chris Gallagher\n\nContributor\n\nAny quality research churns out huge amounts of data. This data needs to be analyzed and depending on the amount of information waiting for processing, you may be in it for a while. But that won't be the case if you have excellent research software for data analysis. This software comes with plenty of benefits that make it a worthy partner in your research process.\n\nHere are the benefits you can gain when you pick the right system for your research.\n\nIncreased Efficiency and Timesaving\n\nSay you're working on a large dataset. Maybe it\u2019s survey responses from hundreds\u2014or even thousands\u2014of people. Now, analyzing that data manually could take days. You\u2019d need to sift through entries, remove duplicates, and standardize formats like dates and numbers. Tedious, isn\u2019t it?\n\nReputable research software like ATLAS.ti or any others you're well-versed with can significantly help here. These tools can streamline data management and improve analytical accuracy, which can accelerate the research process while ensuring comprehensive and insightful analysis.\n\nAlso, many of these tools come with AI-powered features, which can help improve productivity almost 5 times over. Instead of struggling with repetitive tasks, you can focus on more exciting things like analyzing trends, drawing conclusions, or preparing that killer presentation.\n\nImproved Accuracy and Reduced Errors\n\nEven with your most careful efforts, you can still enter a number incorrectly or miss a detail when calculating averages. And when you\u2019re working with a lot of data, those small errors can snowball into major problems. Research software helps eliminate this risk.\n\nMost of these tools come programmed to follow strict rules, ensuring consistent and accurate results. However, this level of accuracy is contingent on you finding the best software to handle the type of data you're analyzing. If you're curious about what to go for, read more here or in any other guide to be well-informed.\n\nHaving the right tool for the job can allow you to replicate calculations easily. Also, if you need to double-check or share your work, you won\u2019t have to start from scratch. This accuracy boosts confidence, whether you\u2019re presenting findings to stakeholders or publishing your research.\n\nAdvanced Analytical Capabilities\n\nSometimes, basic calculations or charts just don\u2019t cut it. Say you\u2019re a social scientist trying to predict trends in public opinion. Or maybe you\u2019re a business analyst looking for hidden patterns in customer purchase behavior. Manually spotting these trends is nearly impossible, especially with large datasets.\n\nResearch software opens up a world of advanced analytics. These tools can handle qualitative data, like open-ended survey responses or interview transcripts. It helps you identify recurring themes without the headache of manually combing through piles of text.\n\nThis software also lets you run complex statistical tests. For example, you could compare how two groups respond to a new product or predict future sales using regression models. The good thing about many of these tools is that they come with user-friendly interfaces or tutorials. So, even if you\u2019re not a data scientist, you can perform high-level analyses with a bit of practice.\n\nEnhanced Data Visualization\n\nYou\u2019ve just finished analyzing your data, and the results are groundbreaking. But when you present it, your audience just stares at a table filled with rows of numbers. The message gets lost, and your hard work feels wasted.\n\nWith the proper research software, this may not be the case, as they often come with data visualization tools. These tools can transform raw numbers into stunning visuals that tell a story. You can use them to create bar charts, heatmaps, scatter plots, and even interactive dashboards.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re presenting sales performance to your team, a heatmap can highlight top-performing regions at a glance. Or, if you\u2019re a health researcher, a line graph could show the rise and fall of disease cases over time.\n\nYour audience can drill down into the data themselves. They can click on a chart to see more details or filter data by categories that interest them. Strong visuals don\u2019t just make your work look professional. They help you communicate findings more effectively.\n\nCollaboration and Accessibility\n\nIn some cases, you might be working on a research project with a team scattered across different cities\u2014or even continents. If so, then sharing files back and forth through email becomes chaotic. Files get lost, versions get mixed up, and you waste precious time trying to sort it all out.\n\nResearch software can solve this headache. Many tools are cloud-based, meaning your entire team can access the same data and work in real time. This is a big deal, given that data analytics takes the biggest bite of the apple when it comes to cloud usage, at 86%, followed by software engineering at 83%.\n\nThese tools can go a long way when it comes to collaboration. One person can clean the data while another creates visuals\u2014all at the same time. These tools also track changes. So, if someone edits a dataset or adjusts a chart, you can easily see who did what and when. This transparency reduces misunderstandings and ensures accountability.\n\nPlus, the accessibility factor is unbeatable. Whether you\u2019re at home, in the office, or on the go, you can log in and pick up right where you left off. That kind of flexibility is a game-changer for teamwork and productivity.\n\nScalability for Large Datasets\n\nSay you\u2019re a small business owner today, working with customer data from a few hundred people. But what happens when your business grows? Suddenly, you\u2019re dealing with thousands\u2014or even millions\u2014of entries. Handling that kind of scale manually is impossible.\n\nResearch software is designed to grow with you. These tools can process massive datasets as they\u2019re built for speed and efficiency, even when the numbers are in the millions. Another benefit is that these tools don\u2019t just handle the data\u2014they make it easy to securely store and access. So, even if your data keeps growing, you\u2019ll never run out of space.\n\nThe best part? Many of these tools are modular. You can start small and upgrade features as your needs expand. This scalability makes research software a long-term investment, saving you time, money, and stress as your data needs evolve.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nResearch software is a tool that can 100% turn your data analysis around. This guide has introduced you to the benefits that come with having one on board. If indeed it's the path you want to take, take your time, do your research and settle for the right fit for your project."

Vishwanatha, PhD, principal investigator of the AIM-AHEAD Coordinating Center, said the program's mission is to tackle health inequities through collaboration between AI experts, health care professionals, and community organizations.\n\nVishwanatha pointed at the challenges these organizations face in securing federal funding for initiatives focused on health disparities.\n\n\"Many awards and all, it is extremely, very difficult for community organizations to actually compete for federal grants. So to overcome these challenges, what NIH did is to start a program for enabling a new mechanism. It is called another transaction,\" he said. \"So that way, we cut down all of the pain, red tape, and we cut down all the procedures that we have.\"\n\nCollaboration is key for the program to not only work but prosper.\n\nThe program's strength, he said, lies in uniting stakeholders from cancer registries, health care centers, and academic departments to find innovative solutions.\n\nAIM-AHEAD has two primary goals: advancing health equity and increasing researcher diversity in AI and machine learning development.\n\nLack of diversity in data\n\nThe initiative emerged in response to concerns raised about the rapid development of AI, particularly regarding the lack of diversity in the data used.\n\nVishwanatha said much of today\u2019s health data, which comes from large hospitals' electronic health records, does not reflect the diversity of the U.S. population.\n\n\"If we don't address that, we don't address the biases in data. Any resulting model that comes out of there, which is applied in a clinic, will actually result in more health disparities, will result in more inequity,\" Vishwanatha said.\n\nHe pointed to an example of how AI could unintentionally perpetuate inequality.\n\n\"If you call a clinic to set an appointment...A lot of times they use algorithms to tell you whether this patient actually needs a really quick appointment or can be scheduled later but the algorithm doesn't know whether this person is a single mother who doesn't have transportation and has to drop her kid at school,\" Vishwanatha said.\n\nTo counter this, Vishwanatha emphasized the need to include social determinants of health\u2014such as income, education, and environment\u2014into AI and machine learning models to ensure they are more inclusive and reflective of the challenges people face.\n\nAs AIM-AHEAD advances its efforts to create more inclusive AI applications, Vishwanatha pointed out the field\u2019s lack of diversity, particularly along the U.S. coasts.\n\n\"If you're not at the table, then you're not contributing your ideas,\" he said. He stressed the importance of including voices from underrepresented communities in AI development.\n\nReal-world impact\n\nDuring the workshop, Vishwanatha shared examples of AIM-AHEAD\u2019s impact on underserved communities.\n\nOne example involved a community organization in Honolulu that had collected valuable social determinants data but didn\u2019t know how to use it. AIM-AHEAD helped transform that data into machine learning-ready information, enabling community health workers to develop an AI tool to better address local health needs.\n\nVishwanatha also highlighted a project in which AI improved breast cancer imaging. Initially, the model showed significant biases when tested on Black and Hispanic populations. Through AIM-AHEAD\u2019s intervention, the algorithm was retrained with more diverse data, improving its accuracy to over 99%.\n\nOther projects include a machine learning model to predict colorectal cancer in American Samoa, where limited resources make regular screenings difficult. AIM-AHEAD provided funding and technical support to help local hospitals leverage existing data for better cancer detection.\n\nVishwanatha said Guam's health discrepancies, including cancers, obesity, and hypertension mirror those seen in other ethnic and racial groups in the U.S.\n\n\"The AIM-AHEAD program is addressing these disparities through community engagement, research, and workforce development programs,\" he said.\n\nRegarding the program\u2019s plans for Guam, Vishwanatha called attention to the importance of developing collaborations between local groups and organizations to better tailor the program to the island\u2019s specific health care needs.\n\n\"Developing collaborations between different stakeholder groups in Guam is an important goal of AIM-AHEAD,\" he said. \"We are particularly interested in promoting programs for community engagement, capacity building, and workforce development.\""

            "article_content": "The conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo risks escalating into a broader regional war, Burundi's president said Saturday, as Africa's top health agency warned the fighting could spark new outbreaks of serious diseases.\n\nThe Rwanda-backed armed group M23 has vowed to march on the capital Kinshasa after capturing eastern DRC's biggest city of Goma earlier this week.\n\nThe lightning offensive is the latest to scar the mineral-rich region, which has seen relentless conflict involving dozens of armed groups kill an estimated six million people over three decades.\n\nThe fall of Goma has rattled the continent, prompting international condemnation and fears of a humanitarian crisis.\n\n\"If it continues like this, war risks becoming widespread in the region,\" Burundi's President Evariste Ndayishimiye said.\n\n\"It is not only Burundi, it is Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya -- it is the whole region, it is a threat,\" he said in an official video posted to YouTube.\n\nHis comments echoed similar remarks by UN chief Antonio Guterres on Thursday.\n\nIllustrating the complicated nature of the conflict, Burundi itself has at least 10,000 soldiers in the east of the DRC, a Burundian military source told AFP.\n\nRwanda accused Burundian troops of actively engaging in fighting against the M23.\n\nRwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said on X that Burundian forces had been \"more engaged in open fighting against the M23\" since October 2023.\n\nMany of the Burundian troops, who are there under a previous military agreement with Kinshasa, have been redeployed to the South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu.\n\nLocals at the market there expressed their concerns Saturday.\n\n\"The M23 says that after having taken Goma, they are coming here to our home in South Kivu,\" said Henriette Butuna, a seller at Bukavu market. \"That's why we are scared, because we don't know either the day or the hour\" they could arrive.\n\n\"We are buying to stock up at home,\" said Josee Zabibu, one customer.\n\nUganda's army meanwhile said Friday it would adopt a \"forward defensive posture\" in eastern DRC.\n\nA UN expert report last July said Rwanda had around 4,000 troops in the east of Democratic Republic of Congo, accusing Kigali of having \"de facto\" control over the M23.\n\nRwanda denies any military involvement, maintaining its goal in eastern DRC is to eradicate a Hutu-led armed group formed in the wake of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\n\nBut the DRC accuses Rwanda of seeking to profit from the region's rare minerals, which are used in technology such as smartphones across the world -- a claim Kigali also denies.\n\nSince M23 and Rwandan troops entered North Kivu province's capital Goma last Sunday, at least 700 people have been killed and another 2,800 wounded in intense clashes, says the United Nations.\n\nThe M23 have outmatched the ill-equipped and poorly paid Congolese forces, who have resorted to hastily recruiting volunteers to fight back.\n\nIn recent days, M23 fighters have advanced into the neighbouring South Kivu province towards the town of Kavumu and its strategic military airport. This is where the Congolese forces have set their main line of defence.\n\nThe fighting in Goma has sparked a \"full-scale public health emergency\", warned the African Union's public health agency.\n\nEven before the latest violence, \"extreme conditions, combined with insecurity and mass displacement have fuelled the mutation of the mpox virus,\" said Africa CDC head Jean Kaseya. \"If decisive action is not taken, it will not be bullets alone that claim lives -- it will be the unchecked spread of major outbreaks and potential pandemics,\" Kaseya added."

            "article_content": "On the night of February 3, 2023, the lives of the residents of East Palestine, Ohio were forever changed. Thirty-eight cars of a Norfolk Southern freight train derailed, erupting into a massive fire that released toxic chemicals into our air, water, and land, just a mile from my home. The sight of a huge fireball from my driveway felt like a scene from an apocalyptic movie. Little did I know, this was only the beginning.\n\nNorfolk Southern released and ignited 115,000 gallons of vinyl chloride, a lethal flammable gas used to make PVC plastic, along with a variety of other chemicals and petroleum products. The smoke wafted for miles, and we braved evacuation orders, health scares, a federal investigation, and a cleanup that is still ongoing. Nearly two years later, my community remains profoundly affected.\n\nEast Palestine and Norfolk Southern recently reached a $22 million settlement. And next week, Vice President JD Vance is expected to visit our town.\n\nA Norfolk Southern train passes through the center of town in East Palestine, May 16, 2023. Rebecca Kiger for TIME\n\nAs we continue to navigate the aftermath of this disaster, now is the time for President Donald Trump and Vance to address the challenges we still face. Their presence in East Palestine, especially in the early days after the disaster, comforted many of us who felt abandoned by government and corporate entities. They gave us hope that even in times of partisan division, leaders could come together to support those in need.\n\nWhile we all felt the immediate effects of this disaster, it is the ongoing recovery that is truly testing our resilience. I am the Chair of the Community Advisory Board for the East Palestine Train Derailment Health Tracking Study spearheaded by Dr. Erin Haynes from the University of Kentucky. One third of study participants show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and these levels have continued to rise through our last reporting period. In addition, around half of the participants indicated they continue to experience upper airway symptoms and non-sinus headaches as well, highlighting the ongoing physical health issues that the community is facing. These findings underscore the severe and lasting impact of the disaster on the residents of East Palestine, emphasizing the urgent need for continued support and intervention.\n\nBoth Trump and Vance have criticized the federal response to the East Palestine disaster. \"We stand with you. We pray for you. And we will stand with you and your fight to help ensure the accountability that you deserve,\u201d said Trump in 2023. \u201cYou have a President going to Ukraine and you have people in Ohio that are in desperate need of help.\u201d\n\nJessica Conard addresses the media outside of the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio, June 14, 2023. Residents from East Palestine assembled to petition Governor DeWine to issue an emergency declaration. Rebecca Kiger for TIME\n\n\"Biden and FEMA said they would not send federal aid to East Palestine under any circumstance. They're not going to send aid,\" Trump also said. (The situation did not qualify for FEMA disaster relief, although the Environmental Protection Agency, National Transportation Safety Board, and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) all contributed resources in the aftermath of the crash.)\n\nAdditionally, Vance also strongly criticized the Biden Administration\u2019s response. \u201cThe Biden administration has ignored Ohio\u2019s pleas for help. This is inexcusable: a disaster declaration would guarantee the delivery of resources the community needs to save itself,\u201d Vance wrote in an August 2023 op-ed. \u201cCleanup efforts overseen by Joe Biden\u2019s environmental protection officials have also been woefully inadequate\u2026Despite the federal government\u2019s vast resources, it appears to be woefully incapable of monitoring the long-term health impacts of a chemical spill.\u201d\n\nNow in their roles as the President and Vice President of the United States, Trump and Vance can address the critiques they lobbed at the previous administration and directly make good on their promises.\n\nBeyond lip service, there are several concrete steps they must take in order to truly support East Palestine.\n\nContaminated soil is removed and loaded onto trucks at the site of the Norfolk Southern toxic train derailment, Oct. 16, 2023. Rebecca Kiger for TIME\n\nProvide long-term healthcare\n\nImpacted residents are still experiencing health effects from chemical exposure and contamination lingering from the 2023 incident, and there is still no organized healthcare guidance nor a funding source for necessary care. It is critical that everyone can access the medical support they need. The President can enact an emergency declaration or urge the HHS to declare a public health emergency to ensure treatment for short- and long-term health impacts for anyone exposed to environmental health hazards from the train derailment and its aftermath.\n\nIn 2023, both Vance and his fellow Ohio Senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, supported an emergency declaration to activate provisions under Section 1881A of the Social Security Act which allows for emergency funding to be distributed to communities affected by disasters. These funds would be a lifeline for many families here who are still grappling with health concerns, economic hardship, and ongoing cleanup efforts. Now as Vice President, Vance needs to ensure federal funds are expediently and strategically allocated to ensure the healthcare needs of our impacted community are safeguarded both in the short term and long term.\n\nMisti Allison instructs East Palestine residents on how to monitor their indoor air quality using a mobile app, Aug. 18, 2023. After a private donor donated 70 indoor air monitors in Aug. 2023, Allison volunteered to design an indoor air quality study. Rebecca Kiger for TIME\n\nIncrease funding for health research\n\nFamilies in East Palestine deserve to understand the long-term health implications of the Norfolk Southern train derailment. Trusted and respected research institutions that were awarded six National Institutes of Health grants to study the short- and long-term impacts of what happened in East Palestine need prolonged funding to help us understand and address the potential health risks faced by our community. Without prolonged funding, these research studies will expire at the end of the year.\n\nMisti Allison and Robin Seman, along with three of Seman\u2019s children, meet with the EPA local response coordinator Mark Durno, Sept. 19, 2023. Rebecca Kiger for TIME\n\nSafeguard environmental monitoring and testing\n\nThe cleanup, monitoring, and testing efforts of our town must continue for decades to ensure that our environment remains safe and habitable. Ongoing support for these efforts is crucial to the health and well-being of our community. This support should include comprehensive environmental testing of our water, land, and air. Additionally, it is essential to regularly test private wells, as they could become contaminated years from now, posing long-term health risks to residents.\n\nTwo years ago, Trump promised our community that he would do everything in his power to ensure our safety and well-being, and that he would not rest until the truth was uncovered. And Vance has repeatedly assured us of his unwavering commitment to working with organizations to ensure East Palestine gets the help it desperately needs and that those responsible are held accountable. Their efforts have given us a glimmer of hope that meaningful change can arise from this disaster.\n\nHowever, we have not yet seen Trump and Vance\u2019s promises turn into action. And we still face a daunting journey ahead in terms of public health, economic recovery, and environmental cleanup. But with the right federal support, I am confident we can implement a comprehensive plan to protect those affected.\n\nOur community demands answers and results, not more excuses. President Trump and Vice President Vance must step up and get East Palestine back on track and set a precedent for how the federal government should support an American community."

            "article_content": "The cyberthreat landscape of 2024 was rife with increasingly sophisticated threats, and encryption played a pivotal role\u2014a staggering 87.2% of threats were hidden in TLS/SSL traffic. The Zscaler cloud blocked 32.1 billion attempted encrypted attacks, a clear demonstration of the growing risk posed by cybercriminals leveraging encryption to evade detection.\n\nThreatLabz reported that malware continues to dominate as the leading encrypted threat, with phishing, cryptojacking, and cross-site scripting (XSS) rapidly on the rise. From nation-state-backed APT groups abusing cloud services to generative AI amplifying phishing, encrypted threats are evolving fast. Industries like manufacturing, technology, and services are bearing the brunt, and the United States and India remain prime targets.\n\nEncrypted threats are showing no signs of slowing down in 2025. The following ThreatLabz predictions explore the shifting dynamics of these stealthy attacks\u2014and the actions your organization must take to stay protected.\n\nTop encrypted attack predictions for 2025Prediction 1: Artificial intelligence and automation will drive a surge in encrypted threatsThe convergence of AI and encrypted traffic will pose escalating challenges for security teams, especially those relying on outdated security tools. Generative AI is likely already fueling threats hidden in encrypted channels with its ability to automate and scale malicious operations, from crafting localized and personalized phishing emails to automating the creation of malicious scripts and payloads. By embedding these threats in TLS/SSL traffic, cybercriminals make detection even more challenging.\n\nPrediction 2: Threat actors will archive encrypted communication for future post-quantum decryptionWith advancements in quantum computing, threat actors are preparing for a future where today\u2019s encryption standards can be broken. More cybercriminals will begin archiving encrypted communications with the intent to decrypt them once post-quantum cryptography becomes viable.\n\nIn August 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) finalized the first post-quantum encrypted standards. Although cryptanalytically relevant quantum computers are not expected until the 2030s, threat actors are already planning for this eventuality. Organizations must prioritize adopting post-quantum encrypted standards to safeguard their data against future decryption threats.\n\nPrediction 3: Abuse of legitimate cloud services will drive encrypted attack growthAs organizations increasingly rely on trusted cloud platforms, cybercriminals will also increasingly turn to these cloud platforms to deliver encrypted threats, capitalizing on the inherent trust in these services. By leveraging default TLS/SSL encryption and the trust granted to widely used cloud providers and their certificates, attackers can embed malicious content within encrypted traffic, making detection far more difficult.\n\nThreatLabz research revealed a rise in cloud service abuse by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups in 2024, revealing Dropbox, OneDrive, and Telegram are the three most abused legitimate cloud services globally.\n\nPrediction 4: Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups will intensify their use of encrypted channels to conceal activitiesNation-state-backed APT groups are poised to weaponize encrypted channels as a core tactic to conduct stealthy and persistent cyber operations, making encrypted threats a dominant challenge in the APT landscape. These groups have the resources and expertise to abuse weaknesses in encrypted protocols, posing heightened risks to government agencies and critical infrastructure.\n\nA notable trend observed by ThreatLabz in 2024 is the rise of APT groups exploiting cloud platforms. By blending in with legitimate traffic, these groups extend the lifespan of their campaigns and make their command-and-control infrastructure harder to trace. This growing misuse of cloud services highlights the urgent need for advanced inspection of encrypted traffic across cloud environments. For further insights into this, check out the ThreatLabz 2024 Encrypted Attacks Report.\n\nPrediction 5: Encrypted command-and-control (C2) activity will become stealthierMalware typically relies on C2 servers to receive information and exfiltrate data. The next wave of malware threats will be defined by a shift toward encrypted, low-profile C2 methods as attackers adapt to evade AI-driven defense systems that detect volume-based anomalies.\n\nRather than generating large volumes of traffic that can be easily detected, attackers will minimize the volume and signature of C2 communications. By using encrypted channels to conceal their activities, they can evade detection by traditional security systems. This trend will set a new standard for sophisticated threat tactics, making it even more difficult for organizations to identify and block malicious communications.\n\nHow to stop encrypted attacks in 2025Stopping encrypted attacks requires advanced security solutions capable of inspecting encrypted traffic without compromising performance. The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange\u2122 offers a comprehensive approach to tackling encrypted threats at every stage of an attack:Minimize the attack surfaceUnchecked encrypted connections, such as those through VPNs or exposed workloads, can expand the attack surface. Zscaler eliminates this risk by keeping applications and services invisible to the internet, effectively reducing the attack surface. By adopting a zero trust architecture, organizations can ensure that only authorized users can access specific applications, preventing attackers from exploiting encrypted connections to reach critical systems.Prevent initial compromiseZscaler Internet Access\u2122 (ZIA) performs full TLS/SSL inspection to verify every connection and stop hidden threats without sacrificing performance. ZIA uses AI-powered analysis and inline detection to identify and block sophisticated threats within encrypted traffic. Unlike traditional, resource-intensive physical appliances, ZIA\u2019s cloud native approach allows organizations to scale encrypted traffic inspection capabilities without performance bottlenecks. This ensures that encrypted threats are detected and blocked before they can cause harm.Eliminate lateral movementOnce attackers gain entry to a network, they often attempt to move laterally to access other systems and data. Zscaler Private Access\u2122 (ZPA) prevents this by enforcing zero trust segmentation and granular access controls. ZPA\u2019s context-aware policies limit users to specific applications, reducing the risk of lateral threat movement. Additionally, Zscaler Deception technology sets decoys to detect and thwart lateral movement attempts, providing an additional layer of defense.Block command-and-control callbacksMalware frequently relies on encrypted channels to communicate with C2 servers. ZIA inspects outgoing and incoming encrypted traffic to disrupt C2 communications, preventing attackers from executing commands, downloading additional malware, or exfiltrating sensitive data. Zscaler\u2019s AI-powered data loss prevention detects and blocks malicious traffic, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure.The rise of encrypted attacks presents a significant challenge for organizations across industries. Threat actors will continue to take advantage of encryption to evade traditional security measures and carry out more sophisticated attacks. By adopting a zero trust architecture and platforms like the Zero Trust Exchange, organizations can minimize the attack surface, prevent initial compromise, and block C2 callbacks within encrypted traffic.To learn more about existing and emerging encrypted threats:\n\nRead the Zscaler ThreatLabz 2024 Encrypted Attacks Report.\n\nRequest a custom demo on how Zscaler can help address your organization\u2019s ransomware protection needs.\n\nFollow Zscaler ThreatLabz on X (Twitter) and our Security Research Blog to stay on top of the latest cyberthreats and security research.

            "article_content": "Are IAM Innovations the Future of Cybersecurity?\n\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) has become instrumental in maintaining an effective cybersecurity strategy. As the digital sphere continues to expand, fostering innovations in IAM is crucial to ensuring robust access security. The management of Non-Human Identities (NHIs) and Secrets security is spearheading this evolution, but how exactly do they contribute to improved security measures?\n\nThe Strategic Role of NHIs and Secrets in Access Security\n\nNHIs are machine identities utilized in cybersecurity. They\u2019re generated by fusing a \u201cSecret\u201d (an encrypted password, token, or key similar to a passport) and the permissions provided to that Secret by a server (much like a visa granted based on your passport). Essentially, managing NHIs and their secrets includes securing both the identities (the \u201ctourist\u201d) and their access credentials (the \u201cpassport\u201d) while concurrently monitoring their behaviors within the system.\n\nComprehensive management of NHIs ascertains the protection of machine identities and secrets at every stage of their lifecycle, from discovery and classification to threat detection and remediation. This robust approach is a step up from solutions like secret scanners which offer limited protection. NHI management platforms provide insights into ownership, permissions, usage patterns, and potential vulnerabilities, enabling contextual security.\n\nBenefits of NHI Management\n\nEffective management of NHIs delivers several benefits, including:\n\nReduced Risk: Proactively identifying and mitigating security risks helps in reducing the chances of breaches and data leaks.\n\nProactively identifying and mitigating security risks helps in reducing the chances of breaches and data leaks. Improved Compliance: NHI management aids in meeting regulatory requirements through policy enforcement and audit trails.\n\nNHI management aids in meeting regulatory requirements through policy enforcement and audit trails. Increased Efficiency: Automation of NHIs and secrets management allows security teams to focus on strategic initiatives.\n\nAutomation of NHIs and secrets management allows security teams to focus on strategic initiatives. Enhanced Visibility and Control: It offers a centralized view for access management and governance.\n\nIt offers a centralized view for access management and governance. Cost Savings: It decreases operational costs by automating secrets rotation and NHIs decommissioning.\n\nThese benefits underline the importance of incorporating NHI management into cybersecurity strategies for holistic security.\n\nSecurity and Innovation: Walking Hand-In-Hand\n\nWhile organizations across financial services, healthcare, travel, DevOps, and SOC teams accustom themselves to operating in the cloud, the need for innovative solutions for identity and access management becomes paramount. This need is met by the evolving principles of NHI and Secret management.\n\nGroundbreaking solutions are necessitating a shift in orientation to think beyond the scope of conventional IAM practices. The introduction of machine identities is a testament to innovation. The management of NHIs aids in addressing security gaps that result from the disconnect between security and R&D teams by creating a secure cloud environment. The security of machine identities and their secrets can significantly decrease the risk of breaches and data leaks, making cybersecurity more effective and efficient. Hence, the success of cybersecurity measures resides not just in their application but also in their evolution.\n\nPaving the Way for a Secure Digital Future\n\nThe importance of IAM innovations for bolstering access security cannot be overstated. Cybersecurity is no longer just about securing systems and networks; it\u2019s also about managing and protecting identities. The management of NHIs and secrets is a stepping stone towards a more secure digital future. While machine learning and artificial intelligence continue to revolutionize how we approach cybersecurity, the strategic management of NHIs sets the foundation for this transformation.\n\nInnovations in Identity and Access Management, especially through the strategic management of NHIs and secrets, will play an increasingly vital role in ensuring robust access security. As cyber threats evolve, so must our defense mechanisms. To stay one step ahead, we must continue to innovate, adapt, and evolve. With the right tools and strategies, organizations can navigate the digital age securely and confidently, championing cybersecurity innovations to protect not only their systems but their identities as well.\n\nFor more insights about our market, follow these useful resources:\n\ncybersecurity predictions,\n\nremediation in cloud environments,\n\npreparation for 2025.\n\nAs we move ahead\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to stay informed and abreast of emerging trends and practices. IAM innovations, especially the management of NHIs and secrets, represent a significant shift in how we approach and manage cybersecurity. Accommodating these changes is essential for organizations striving to secure their digital identities and operations.\n\nUnderstanding the Implications of Managing NHIs for Cybersecurity\n\nAs access management increasingly plays an instrumental role in cybersecurity strategies, breakthroughs in the management of Non-Human Identities (NHIs) and Secrets are leading the way. An understanding of how these mechanisms contribute to fortified security measures is paramount for technologists, CISOs, and organizations alike. Data-driven insights offer a more comprehensive perspective on the transformative role of NHIs and secrets management.\n\nUnpacking the Lifecycle of NHIs\n\nSuccessfully utilizing NHIs involves managing code identities or apps throughout their lifespan, including both their active and inactive stages. This comprehensive life cycle from creation to deactivation encapsulates various stages including provision, use, rotation, and decommission. End-to-end NHI lifecycle management ensures improved visibility and oversight, resulting in effective risk mitigation.\n\nEach stage within the lifecycle of an NHI presents unique challenges and opportunities for security enhancement. Proactively deploying access control measures and monitoring access behaviors at each stage allows organizations to pre-emptively address potential vulnerabilities. Data-backed insights have shown us that approximately 30% of corporate software vulnerabilities stem from the misuse or mismanagement of NHIs, underscoring the crucial role of comprehensive management strategies.\n\nShift from Reactive to Proactive Security Paradigms\n\nTraditionally, cybersecurity measures often operate on the principle of reaction, responding to threats as they arise. With the widespread adoption and implementation of NHI and secrets management, the paradigm is shifting towards proactive defense mechanisms. These innovative approaches pre-emptively identify and mitigate potential security risks, reducing the risk of security breaches and data leaks.\n\nEffective NHI management, therefore, structures an inherent resilience to threats into the cybersecurity architecture of an organization.\n\nHow Data-Powered Insights Influence Change\n\nComplimenting this strategic stance, leveraging data insights can drastically improve risk mitigation. Security teams equipped with comprehensive insights and metrics are more adept at identifying risk factors and making informed decisions. These include, but are not limited to, understanding ownership, permissions, usage patterns, and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nData-driven security models offer organized real-time visibility and analytics to reduce blind spots. A cybersecurity strategy is significantly more impactful when guided by accurate, actionable intelligence provided by these insights, helping organizations stay ahead of potential threats.\n\nTransitioning Gatekeepers: From Humans to Machines\n\nWhere data is the new currency, data gatekeepers have transformed. What was once the sole responsibility of human operators has progressively shifted to machines or Non-Human Identities (NHIs). These NHIs, coupled with their access credentials or \u201cSecrets\u201d, are now responsible for accessing, processing, and managing vast pools of data within organizations.\n\nThis transformation cautions us to shift the epicenter of our security focus from traditional IAM models to innovative and encompassing NHI management. After all, NHIs today constitute approximately 80% of all organizational identities, a significant rise from just a decade ago.\n\nCollaborative Approach Towards Enhanced Cybersecurity\n\nThe future of cybersecurity lies in collective coexistence. By amalgamating the principles of traditional IAM practices with the innovative approaches of NHI and secrets management, organizations can bolster their cybersecurity architecture for improved resilience against threats.\n\nThe constant collaboration between identity and access management and rapidly evolving NHIs is the key to remaining robust and dynamic security challenges.\n\nMoving Toward a Secure Future\n\nBy focusing on strategic management of NHIs and secrets, organizations can adopt an effectively future-forward approach. As technology continues to leap with advancements in AIM and machine identities, it\u2019s important to remain agile and adaptive. Here\u2019s to realizing the potential of NHI management and innovating toward more secure, resilient, and robust cybersecurity ecosystems.\n\nThe post Innovations in Identity and Access Management appeared first on Entro.\n\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from Entro authored by Amy Cohn.

            "article_content": "Two Columbus School District educators are recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.\n\nSuzy Zietlow, a third-grade teacher at the Discovery Charter School, and Mark Bussian, the district\u2019s instructional coach, have received the nation\u2019s highest honor for teachers of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\nThe two Columbus educators are among 336 educators around the country to receive the award.\n\nZietlow began her career at the Discovery Charter School in 2010.\n\n\u201cI started teaching second grade at Discovery Charter School and in 2012 I moved up to third grade,\u201d said Zietlow, who has a degree in microbiology and briefly did research before getting her teaching certificate from UW-Stevens Point.\n\nZietlow said she was nominated for the award by a friend who works for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction whom she had gone to conferences within the past.\n\n\u201cHe had seen what I did in my classroom and nominated me,\u201d Zietlow said, which started her on the application process in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn Discovery Charter School, we focus a lot on science and outdoor classroom work,\u201d Zietlow said. \u201cFor part of our culture, we have the regular math curriculum, and we follow a standards-based literacy curriculum, too, but whenever possible we are using science in those areas.\u201d\n\nStudents also are taken outside regularly to learn subjects with the help of their natural surroundings, Zietlow said.\n\nBussian has been the Columbus School District\u2019s instructional coach for the last year. He was the second-grade teacher at Token Springs Elementary School in Sun Prairie when he became a finalist for the award in 2022. Bussian said he was nominated by his principal there.\n\nBussian said he believes he was nominated for the award in part because of \u201cthe way I interact with students and look at different students\u2019 individual needs and the opportunities that I am able to give them instead of just a one size fits all approach. It is individualizing and personalizing and meeting them where they are at for their needs.\u201d\n\nHe focuses on helping all students to reflect on their learning and see where they are doing well, and where they need improvement, Bussian said.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, I am able to coach them up rather than be the person who is always in front of the class,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cIt is more an opportunity for them to learn everything based on the standards and learn from that.\u201d\n\nIn his new position in Columbus, Bussian said he likes working with a variety of different grade levels.\n\n\u201cI work with 4K all the way to high school teachers, and I am able to help them to work on best practices and things along those lines,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cI always say the teachers that I work with are the experts in their content area, and I am the one who can serve as a thought partner or can help with assessments or resources. If they have questions on why certain students might not be understanding concepts, then I\u2019m a sound board but also an extra set of eyes. I work very close with the teachers and that gives me a chance to work with a variety of students, too.\u201d\n\nWith the award, the two educators will receive $10,000 from the National Science Foundation, a certificate signed by the president and a trip to Washington, D.C. . While they are in Washington, they will participate in professional development activities and network with fellow STEM educators.\n\nBussian said they haven\u2019t been told a date yet for the trip to Washington.\n\nGALLERY: Columbus Fourth of July Parade fills the streets Columbus001.jpg Columbus002.jpg Columbus003.jpg Columbus004.jpg Columbus005.jpg Columbus006.jpg Columbus007.jpg Columbus008.jpg Columbus009.jpg Columbus010.jpg Columbus011.jpg Columbus012.jpg Columbus013.jpg Columbus014.jpg Columbus015.jpg Columbus016.jpg Columbus017.jpg Columbus018.jpg Columbus019.jpg Columbus020.jpg Columbus021.jpg Columbus022.jpg Columbus023.jpg Columbus024.jpg Columbus025.jpg Columbus026.jpg Columbus027.jpg Columbus028.jpg Columbus029.jpg Columbus030.jpg Columbus031.jpg Columbus032.jpg Columbus033.jpg Columbus034.jpg Columbus035.jpg Columbus036.jpg Columbus037.jpg Columbus038.jpg Columbus039.jpg Columbus040.jpg Columbus041.jpg Columbus042.jpg Columbus043.jpg Columbus044.jpg Columbus045.jpg Columbus046.jpg Columbus047.jpg Columbus048.jpg Columbus049.jpg Columbus050.jpg Columbus051.jpg Columbus052.jpg Columbus053.jpg Columbus054.jpg Columbus055.jpg Columbus056.jpg Columbus057.jpg Columbus058.jpg Columbus059.jpg Columbus060.jpg Columbus061.jpg Columbus062.jpg Columbus063.jpg Columbus064.jpg Columbus065.jpg Columbus066.jpg Columbus067.jpg Columbus068.jpg Columbus069.jpg Columbus070.jpg Columbus071.jpg Columbus072.jpg Columbus073.jpg Columbus074.jpg Columbus075.jpg Columbus076.jpg Columbus077.jpg Columbus078.jpg Columbus079.jpg Columbus080.jpg Columbus081.jpg Columbus082.jpg Columbus083.jpg Columbus084.jpg Columbus085.jpg Columbus086.jpg Columbus087.jpg Columbus088.jpg Columbus089.jpg Columbus090.jpg Columbus091.jpg Columbus092.jpg Columbus093.jpg Columbus094.jpg Columbus095.jpg Columbus096.jpg Columbus097.jpg Columbus098.jpg Columbus099.jpg Columbus100.jpg Columbus101.jpg Columbus102.jpg Columbus103.jpg Columbus104.jpg Columbus105.jpg Columbus106.jpg Columbus107.jpg Columbus108.jpg Columbus109.jpg Columbus110.jpg Columbus111.jpg Columbus112.jpg Columbus113.jpg Columbus114.jpg Columbus115.jpg Columbus116.jpg Columbus117.jpg Columbus118.jpg Columbus119.jpg Columbus120.jpg Columbus121.jpg Columbus122.jpg Columbus123.jpg Columbus124.jpg Columbus125.jpg Columbus126.jpg Columbus127.jpg Columbus128.jpg Columbus129.jpg Columbus130.jpg Columbus131.jpg Columbus132.jpg Columbus133.jpg Columbus134.jpg Columbus135.jpg Columbus136.jpg Columbus137.jpg Columbus138.jpg Columbus139.jpg Columbus140.jpg Columbus141.jpg Columbus142.jpg Columbus143.jpg Columbus144.jpg Columbus145.jpg Columbus146.jpg Columbus147.jpg Columbus148.jpg Columbus149.jpg Columbus150.jpg Columbus151.jpg Columbus152.jpg Columbus153.jpg Columbus154.jpg Columbus155.jpg Columbus156.jpg Columbus157.jpg Columbus158.jpg Columbus159.jpg Columbus160.jpg Columbus161.jpg Columbus162.jpg Columbus163.jpg Columbus164.jpg Columbus165.jpg Columbus166.jpg Columbus167.jpg Columbus168.jpg Columbus169.jpg Columbus170.jpg Columbus171.jpg Columbus172.jpg Columbus173.jpg Columbus174.jpg Columbus175.jpg Columbus176.jpg Columbus177.jpg Columbus178.jpg Columbus179.jpg Columbus180.jpg Columbus181.jpg Columbus182.jpg Columbus183.jpg Columbus184.jpg Columbus185.jpg Columbus186.jpg Columbus187.jpg Columbus188.jpg Columbus189.jpg"

            "article_content": "In a networked society, secure communication is essential. Quantum physics delivers the necessary foundation by allowing practicable technologies such as quantum key distribution. With the new fiber optic test facility at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), which opened on January 22, 2025, researchers aim to transmit, test and refine quantum keys. They also plan to set up a quantum network to link quantum computers.\n\n\n\nTo generate and transmit the quantum keys, the researchers will use cutting-edge technologies such as ultra-coherent lasers with the new fiber optic test facility. Quantum keys are crucial for secure communication because they are based on physical laws instead of the mathematical assumptions underlying earlier encryption keys, which future quantum computers will be able to break.\n\n\n\nSpanning 20 kilometers, the quantum-optical transmission line connects laboratories specially equipped with complex lasers and cryostats on KIT\u2019s Campus South and Campus North. The light-guiding core of a fiber optic cable is only about 9 micrometers in diameter. For comparison, the thickness of a human hair is about 60 micrometers.\n\n\n\nImportant Quantum Research Platform\n\n\u201cQuantum communication is a strategically important field for KIT, so I\u2019m especially pleased that with the finished test facility, KIT is providing its researchers with important infrastructure for investigating the opportunities offered by quantum physics,\u201d said Oliver Kraft, Vice President for Research at KIT. \u201cWith this facility, we\u2019re making an important contribution to the advancement of research and development in quantum network technology, with an eye to practical applications.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the fiber-optic test facility, we have a platform for improving quantum key distribution, investigating its basic properties, and integrating it in classical communication,\u201d said Professor David Hunger of the Physikalisches Institut at KIT, who heads the project. Based on this work, the scientists aim to develop new transmission protocols for the keys. \u201cWith the new methods we develop, we want to make quantum cryptography more efficient and practical. We\u2019re working on this e.g. with KEEQuant, a quantum communication start-up,\u201d added Hunger. \u201cFurthermore, using novel materials such as molecular quantum emitters, we want to generate ultrapure quantum light \u2013 individual photons \u2013 to increase transmission rates.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuilding a Quantum Network\n\nThe researchers will also be progressively building a quantum network to investigate the quantum internet of the future. Their work focuses on two crucial steps: storing quantum information in special quantum memories, and quantum entanglement of the memories. This will make it possible to implement quantum repeaters for the transmission of quantum information over long distances. Since entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum computers, such computers can be connected with one another in a quantum internet via optical transmission of the entanglement.\n\n\n\nTest Facility Part of Chem4Quant Cluster of Excellence Initiative\n\nThe project is a key part of the infrastructure for the Chem4Quant Cluster of Excellence initiative, in which researchers from KIT, Ulm University and the University of Stuttgart will design materials for future quantum technologies and focus on molecular quantum systems, a new field of quantum technology. In addition, the project plays an important role in the quantum repeater research conducted in the Quantenrepeater.Net (QR.N) joint project of Germany\u2019s Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and in the QuantumBW Innovation Campus.\n\n\n\nMore information\n\nDetailed caption: Opening of the fiber optic test facility at KIT: (from left to right) Prof. Sebastian Randel (KIT), Prof. Marc Weber (Head of Division B V, KIT), Prof. Oliver Kraft (Vice President Research, KIT), Prof. Mario Ruben (KIT), Prof. David Hunger (KIT) (Photo: Daryoush Djavadi)\n\n\n\nBeing \u201cThe Research University in the Helmholtz Association\u201d, KIT creates and imparts knowledge for the society and the environment. It is the objective to make significant contributions to the global challenges in the fields of energy, mobility, and information. For this, about 10,000 employees cooperate in a broad range of disciplines in natural sciences, engineering sciences, economics, and the humanities and social sciences. KIT prepares its 22,800 students for responsible tasks in society, industry, and science by offering research-based study programs. Innovation efforts at KIT build a bridge between important scientific findings and their application for the benefit of society, economic prosperity, and the preservation of our natural basis of life. KIT is one of the German universities of excellence."
