It was funny at first, but then it started feeling like I was back in school making excuses for my late homework. But it\u2019s not the bird\u2019s fault! I just learn more from listening and speaking than from memorization. That\u2019s actually why I\u2019ve been looking at Babbel. Babbel\u2019s lessons are pretty short (10-15 minutes), and you can choose from listening, speaking, writing, or vocabulary exercises. Plus, the price for a lifetime subscription just dropped. Instead of paying $599, now it\u2019s $129.99.\n\nWhat does Babbel have that Duolingo doesn\u2019t?\n\nBabbel just dropped its own dedicated AI that can talk to you in the language you\u2019re learning. So, instead of just memorizing terms, now you can actually have a conversation. You can practice your pronunciation and listen to the AI\u2019s response. It\u2019s like talking to a native speaker without the performance anxiety.\n\nWhat language do you want to learn first? Babbel has over 10,000 hours of material to study and 14 different languages to practice. Here\u2019s a sampling\n\nFrench\n\nSpanish\n\nGerman\n\nItalian\n\nPortuguese\n\nSwedish\n\nLessons are all geared toward practical topics like asking directions, dining, shopping, making friends, conducting business, and just having normal conversations. That also means you can quickly learn a few useful phrases before you travel, or you can take the long road and work toward fluency. With a lifetime subscription, there\u2019s certainly time.\n\nYou can access Babbel on as many devices as you want. It works on desktop and mobile, and your progress syncs across all your devices.\n\nThis sale isn\u2019t going to last much longer.\n\nUse code LEARN40 by February 2 at 11:59 p.m. PT to get a lifetime subscription to Babbel for $129.99.\n\nStackSocial prices subject to change.\n\nBabbel Language Learning: Lifetime Subscription (All Languages) \u2013 $129.99\n\nSee Deal"

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s note: Welcome to the world of \u201cParanormal PA,\u201d a PennLive series that delves into Pennsylvania-grown stories of spirits; cryptids; oddities and legends; and the unexplained. Sign up here to get our Paranormal PA newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nBy all accounts, Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s life is pretty sweet.\n\nHe\u2019s immortal. He\u2019s got a great wife and kids. And his only job requirement is going outside once a year.\n\nBut before anyone poo-poos what many view as one of Pennsylvania\u2019s \u2014 or, indeed, the country\u2019s \u2014 more bizarre traditions, Paranormal Pa. will have you know that Phil is a product of a storied tradition (and superstition) that stretches back for years and years.\n\nGerman immigrants brought the tradition over when they settled in Pennsylvania hundreds of years ago. (AP Photo/Barry Reeger)AP\n\nThe Punsutawney Groundhog Club explains how the first time \u201cWeather Wags\u201d recognized Groundhog Day was in 1886, although the first official trek to Gobbler\u2019s Knob was the following year.\n\nBut the concept of having animals predict the weather goes way back before the 19th century. According to the Library of Congress Blogs, Groundhog Day\u2019s lineage can be traced back to ancient pre-Christian festivals celebrated by the Celts that served as midway points between equinoxes. Halloween \u2014 originally Samhain \u2014 falls into this category, too.\n\nFormerly known as \u201cImbolc\u201d before it eventually became the Christianized Candlemas, Groundhog Day was once considered the first day of spring. And while little is known about how the Celts celebrated the day, one traditional practice was attempting to divine the weather.\n\nNow, here\u2019s how animals figure into this: Ancient people used to observe animal behavior as part of their own farming practices, so the idea of watching how a groundhog to see whether or not spring was on its way makes sense.\n\nVisitPa.com adds how Roman legions, in their conquest of northern Europe, eventually spread the Candelmas Day tradition of candles being blessed and distributed. Those living in what\u2019s now Germany soon began to believe that if the sun made an appearance on the day, an animal who cast his shadow would predict six more weeks of cruddy weather.\n\nGroundhog Club President Tom Dunkel taps on the immortal groundhog's door so the weather oracle can make his prediction. (AP Photo/Barry Reeger)AP\n\nIn his book \u201cGroundhog Day (2003),\u201d Dan Yoder writes how the Germans who brought this tradition over to the U.S. used to watch badgers to see how far away spring was (the German folk expression for the holiday was \u201cDachstag,\u201d or \u201cBadger Day\u201d). Then somewhere along the line, that badger became a groundhog.\n\nNot to say that early Groundhog Day celebrations in Pennsylvania didn\u2019t maintain a bit of their mysticism: Yoder describes late 19th century celebrations of involving ritualized Groundhog Hunts in September which drew in \u201cdevotees from Pittsburgh and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nOne parade in 1909, as staged by the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, was deemed \u201cthe Circumgyratory Pageant of the Astrologers, Horoscopists, Magicians, Soothsayers, and Meteorological Attach\u00e9s of Punxsutawney Weather Works.\u201d A man named Clymer Freas \u2014 credited as conceiving of the idea for the holiday \u2014 even created \u201cGroundhogese,\u201d the language Groundhog Club presidents learn in order to discern the groundhog\u2019s annual predictions.\n\nThere may not be any more astrologists or soothsayers involved, but Groundhog Day remains a celebration: More than 30,000 people from across the globe drop by Knobbler\u2019s Creek on the day, getting up at the crack of dawn in the dead of winter to watch Phil make his prediction.\n\nTo be fair, though, even back in the day, people raised their eyebrows at the idea of watching a rodent predict how much longer winter would last.\n\n\u201cIn consequence, probably of having given all spiritual matters to the exclusive supervision of the clergy, newspaper editors are somewhat skeptical about many things which are popularly accepted with absolute faith,\u201d read an 1876 edition of the Harrisburg Daily Patriot.\n\n\u201cThis may account for the reason that some of them have failed to appreciate the sentiment\u2026in favor of a legal recognition of Ground Hog Day.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, editorial skepticism be damned, Groundhog Day won out, and did, indeed, spawn an industry. And inspired a Bill Murray movie. And tons of Punxsutawney wannabes like Staten Island Chuck, who did, it should be noted, tragically lost his life after former New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio quite literally fumbled him (never forget).\n\nYes, the holiday has come very far from its very old roots. And whether you\u2019re an eyebrow-raiser to the holiday or all-in, it doesn\u2019t look like Groundhog Day is going away any time soon.\n\nThat is, unless PETA has their way."

            "article_content": "For centuries, we\u2019ve viewed the Moon as dead, its surface frozen in time since ancient volcanic activity faded billions of years ago. However, new research suggests this might not be entirely true. A study published in The Planetary Science Journal reveals that our Moon lives\u2014or at least has been geologically active much more recently than we once believed.\n\nScientists from the University of Maryland (UMD) have identified 266 small ridges on the far side of the Moon\u2014a region we never see from Earth. These formations, called mare ridges, appear to be significantly younger than previously expected.\n\nEstimating the age of these ridges, the researchers believe that the most recent movement of the Moon\u2019s geological structures may have occurred just 14 million years ago\u2014a mere blink of an eye in the Moon\u2019s expansive 4.5-billion-year history. This discovery could mean that the Moon still lives, though it isn\u2019t nearly as active as it once was.\n\nImage source: helen_f / Adobe\n\nThis, of course, challenges long-held beliefs that lunar activity ended around 3 billion years ago when the Moon\u2019s molten surface cooled. Scientists previously believed the only changes after this time came from meteor impacts. However, these ridges cut through much younger impact craters, indicating that tectonic activity continued within the last 200 million years.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Scientists believe these maria were created when asteroid impacts triggered massive lava eruptions billions of years ago.\n\nThe far side of the Moon was bombarded more heavily than the near side, leading researchers to assume it cooled and solidified faster. But these new ridges suggest that internal movement continued much later and that the Moon may still live.\n\nThat last point is extremely importantly, as it raises more questions and the evidence points towards another revelation\u2014the Moon is still contracting as it slowly cools. This causes surface wrinkles similar to those seen on a shrinking apple.\n\nBut is the Moon still changing today? Does it still live? Perhaps future manned missions to the Moon will help us determine that or\u2014at the least\u2014provide us with more data to investigate."

It is the subject of multiple lawsuits along those lines, including from The New York Times, which claims the company built its model in part by ingesting millions of the newspaper\u2019s stories without permission.\n\nOn Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted a congratulations to DeepSeek on X, saying it had developed \u201can impressive model, particularly around what they\u2019re able to deliver for the price.\u201d\n\nThe OpenAI spokesperson indicated the White House may get involved in the dispute.\n\n\u201cWe take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the U.S. government to protect the most capable models being built here,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump\u2019s AI adviser, David Sacks, told Fox News that he believed DeepSeek did distill from OpenAI, but stopped short of declaring that the White House would take action.\n\n\u201cI think one of the things you\u2019re going to see over the next few months is our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would definitely slow down some of these copycat models.\u201d\n\nBrian Hughes, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in an email to NBC News that the White House was looking into the broader issue but didn't specifically address OpenAI's distillation accusation.\n\n\u201cAt the President\u2019s direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government are working in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security. As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nWeb client runtime security (WCRS) refers to the security or behavior of the code executed in users' internet browsers during their web interactions. The first part of this article series includes details of why WCRS as a security discipline warrants specific focus in addition to traditional web application security practices. Traditional approaches to web application security have often focused on scanning code for vulnerabilities, as well as scanning and monitoring for security weaknesses from the perspective of the web hosting provider.\n\nThis second article describes the limitations of traditional security solutions in addressing WCRS risk and proposes implementation options for purpose-built security solutions. Specifically, the strengths and limitations of three key traditional application security mechanisms are covered, before proposing certain viable implementation options for addressing WCRS needs. These mechanisms include static analysis, dynamic analysis, and manual code reviews, each offering unique benefits and challenges in the context of web application security.\n\nStatic Application Security Testing\n\nStatic application security testing (SAST)1 involves analyzing source code for vulnerabilities while the application is being developed or analyzing any code changes that are made to an existing application. This is a traditional approach to code scanning that is utilized by many organizations. SAST can catch many vulnerabilities before applications are released into production. Some vendor products generate a report of potential vulnerabilities. Others go a step further, by scanning code while a developer is typing, and highlighting potential problems in the integrated development environment. After reviewing the vulnerability report produced by one of these tools, developers might go through multiple code remediation and re-scanning cycles until a passing scan is achieved. This approach is beneficial for early vulnerability detection, allowing developers to address issues before the code is deployed. Figure 1 summarizes the pros and cons of SAST.\n\nFigure 1 \u2014 Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Considerations\n\n\n\nHowever, SAST does not account for runtime behaviors or interactions with dynamically loaded scripts, which are common in modern web applications. As a result, vulnerabilities introduced through third-party scripts or supply chain attacks can go undetected. SAST tools are designed to assess code as it is written, not as it is executed in the varied web application environments, limiting their effectiveness in addressing WCRS threats.\n\nStrengths\u2014SAST analyzes source code for vulnerabilities, offering early detection during the development phase.\n\nLimitations\u2014SAST does not cover runtime behaviors or interactions with dynamically loaded scripts. It may also not detect vulnerabilities introduced through third-party scripts or supply chain attacks.\n\nDynamic Application Security Testing\n\nDynamic application security testing (DAST)2 involves testing applications in their running state and simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities. This method provides insights into application behavior while under attack and can uncover issues that static analysis might miss. Many organizations supplement their SAST processes with DAST because DAST scans can detect vulnerabilities in the deployed environment, which would not be evident from reviewing application code. Server misconfigurations, weak authentication, and security headers are some examples of vulnerabilities detected by DAST scans. The pros and cons of DAST are depicted in figure 2.\n\nFigure 2 \u2014 Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Considerations\n\n\n\nDAST has its limitations, particularly in detecting vulnerabilities that manifest only in specific web client runtime environments. Malicious code can evade DAST by activating only under certain conditions that the testing environment does not replicate. Additionally, DAST cannot fully understand and evaluate the behavior of third-party scripts, rendering it less effective against the threats that exploit these external dependencies. Last, DAST scans are detective by nature, offering few preventive capabilities that would protect organizations during supply chain attacks at runtime.\n\nStrengths\u2014DAST tests applications in their running state, simulating real-world attacks.\n\nLimitations\u2014DAST might miss vulnerabilities that only manifest in specific web client runtime environments. Malicious code can hide from DAST by only executing in specific user contexts, and DAST does not provide real-time protection from unwanted script behavior.\n\nInteractive Application Security Testing\n\nInteractive application security testing (IAST)3 combines elements of SAST and DAST by analyzing applications in real time during normal operations. This method allows for more comprehensive detection of vulnerabilities by observing code execution and interactions from within the application, as opposed to external DAST scanning. It enables organizations to detect issues that may go unnoticed by SAST or DAST, such as vulnerabilities arising from specific application workflows or interactions between components. Figure 3 depicts relevant IAST considerations for organizations.\n\nFigure 3 \u2014 Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) Consideration\n\n\n\nWhile IAST provides deeper insights compared to purely static or dynamic testing, it still faces challenges in WCRS. IAST tools require integration into the application, which can be complex and resource intensive. Moreover, they may not fully capture the behavior of third-party scripts or adequately monitor client-side code that executes in user browsers, limiting their effectiveness in preventing client-side attacks.\n\nStrengths\u2014IAST combines elements of SAST and DAST by analyzing applications in real time during normal operations.\n\nLimitations\u2014IAST tools require integration into the application, which can be complex and may not detect client-side script vulnerabilities introduced by third parties.\n\nTraditional Security Mechanisms are Limited\n\nSAST, DAST, IAST, and other traditional security tools, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems are limited by their perspective of application and infrastructure runtime states from a provider\u2019s point of view. They might inspect the observable network traffic between client web browsers and the trusted private hosting environment where much of the web application content might be hosted. However, these tools may overlook unintentional data leaks between client browsers and third-party services, as well as Magecart attacks that could exploit these trusted third-party services. The gaps in coverage of the traditional security tools are illustrated as potential risk in figure 4.\n\nFigure 4 \u2014 WCRS Limitations of Traditional Security Solutions\n\n\n\nThese limitations underscore the need for specialized client-side security solutions. Such specialized solutions should examine runtime states from a client\u2019s perspective and address the unique challenges of securing client-side code.\n\nTechnology Solutions for WCRS\n\nAs traditional application security mechanisms or approaches do not provide necessary safeguards against WCRS risk, organizations may need to consider other options for their WCRS capabilities. This section proposes certain mechanisms, each of which may have distinct approaches and corresponding benefits.\n\nThe web client-side security market has witnessed significant growth in recent years, driven by the increasing recognition of the risk associated with third-party scripts and supply chain attacks. This rapidly maturing space features a variety of solutions, each with distinct approaches and benefits.\n\nOrganizations should evaluate each approach carefully before selecting the most suitable options for their specific website contexts.\n\nCDN and Proxy-Based Solutions\n\nMany internet-facing web applications are already deployed behind content delivery networks (CDNs) to protect them from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and improve performance by caching content closer to end users. Given their strategic position in the delivery chain, CDN providers are well-suited to enhance client-side security by examining all resources before they reach client browsers. By intercepting and analyzing web traffic, CDNs can identify and block malicious scripts, ensuring that only safe and verified content is delivered.\n\nCDN and proxy-based solutions offer a transparent layer of security without requiring significant changes to existing infrastructure. This transparency is a major advantage, as it simplifies deployment and reduces the burden on development and operations teams.\n\nThese solutions typically feature a web-based portal that offers near real-time visibility into the resources loaded by clients. Through this portal, customers can monitor scripts and other elements being delivered to end users.\n\nStrengths\u2014 CDN and proxy-based solutions require minimal effort for the initial deployment if monitored web applications are already protected by the CDN solution from DDoS attacks. In such cases, the CDN provider is already able to monitor web traffic, and the client security module is simply enabled by the third-party CDN provider upon purchase. This solution also avoids the introduction of third-party code into web applications, often shortening implementation timelines and avoiding delays due to vetting by other cybersecurity and third-party risk teams within the purchasing organization.\n\nLimitations\u2014Visibility of third-party script behavior is limited to data transmitted via the CDN network and is not always representative of third-party script behavior on customer browsers, particularly once they begin interacting with the web application. Furthermore, this solution is only offered by a limited number of CDN providers. Internally facing applications, including traffic that is not routed through a particular CDN, would require a different approach for client-side protection.\n\nRemote Scanning Solutions\n\nRemote scanning solutions provide an external perspective on the security of web applications by assessing them from outside the organization\u2019s network. These tools are designed to identify vulnerabilities and malicious code that may be present in the client-side scripts and resources delivered to users. By periodically loading and crawling an internet-facing web application, remote scanners can detect and analyze scripts, security headers, and other resources that would be loaded by client browsers while interacting with a monitored web application, offering a simplified view with minimal effort from customers.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of remote scanning is its ease of implementation. Since these tools operate externally, they require minimal configuration and do not require updates to the existing infrastructure or code. Remote scanning can quickly provide a high-level overview of the security posture of web applications, highlighting areas of concern that require further investigation. However, while remote scanning is effective at identifying many common vulnerabilities, it has its limitations. For example, it may struggle to access and analyze content behind authentication barriers, and sophisticated malicious code can sometimes hide from these scans by only activating under specific conditions.\n\nRemote scanning solutions often include a web-based interface that offers detailed reports on the findings. These reports provide insights into the resources that would be loaded by client browsers. Customers can justify the presence of certain scripts, ensuring that they are necessary for enterprise operations while maintaining compliance. Additionally, these tools can notify users of any changes to the scripts or security headers, enabling timely responses to new risk and maintaining the integrity of client-side security measures.\n\nStrengths\u2014Remote scanning solutions are easy to implement and provide a basic, limited view into a monitored web application.\n\nLimitations\u2014Limited visibility and accuracy can lead to potential blind spots, especially when dealing with sophisticated threats. Resources that require user login, or those requiring more complicated actions from users before they are loaded and executed, may be overlooked. Furthermore, this solution offers no protection or remediation capabilities, as it is used for detection only.\n\nVendor Solutions Based on CSP Headers\n\nThe HTTP Content Security Policy (CSP) response header, universally supported by modern web browsers, provides advanced client-side security capabilities. Web applications can instruct client browsers via detailed policies on what resources are necessary parts of a web application and which safe locations they can be loaded from. Web browsers can also be instructed to block or report unexpected behavior.\n\nIn their simpler form, WCRS solutions may leverage a custom CSP header directive that does not directly block any suspicious behavior and simply instructs all client browsers to report what content was loaded in near real time. Dashboards display script inventories and observe script behavior for monitored applications. Many vendor solutions will take this a step further, leveraging proprietary and open-source threat intelligence feeds to alert their customers to any known malicious content and behavior. To further protect their customers, some vendor solutions will suggest more advanced CSPs that could be implemented in \u201cprevent mode\u201d. This mode will automatically block unexpected scripts. However, this option works best for simple web applications managed by technically savvy organizations due to the complexity and operational stability risk.\n\nIntegrating CSP headers requires customers to modify their web applications, which can delay implementation. Despite this, the header directive is transparent in its function and does not necessitate extensive vetting. By providing accurate and timely reporting without the need for more complex vendor-provided script integration, CSP header-based monitoring offers a balanced solution that enhances security while keeping code changes minimal and transparent to customers.\n\nStrengths\u2014CSP headers provide accurate real-time reporting of resources and scripts executed by client browsers. This solution requires minimal changes to the web application code.\n\nLimitations\u2014CSP headers require basic changes to the web application, which may necessitate change control, testing, and approvals. These necessary steps may delay implementation. Moreover, implementation of optional custom CSP policies may only work well for simple web applications, as these policies are often much more complex and can cause operational impact. They can block external resources and other essential web application functionality if they are not explicitly approved ahead of time.\n\nSolutions Based on Custom Vendor-Provided JavaScript\n\nMany WCRS solutions require monitored applications to include custom JavaScript provided by the vendor. This option introduces risk and can extend timelines for approval and vetting. However, despite these challenges, it provides additional granular visibility of script behavior at the data element level and enables dynamic policy evaluation and enforcement.\n\nThis approach allows for the implementation of script behavior policies, which go beyond the detection and reporting of unauthorized script behaviors and actively block unwanted actions in real time. For example, certain scripts can be authorized to access credit card fields and/or perform keystroke logging, while all others are denied from performing such actions. Vendor-provided JavaScript solutions can dynamically adjust policies based on the ongoing evaluation of script behaviors, enabling more proactive and robust client-side security controls.\n\nImplementing CSP headers with custom JavaScript requires significant changes to the web application, necessitating rigorous change control, testing, and approvals. Although preparations for this solution tend to be robust, its ability to provide granular control and advanced security features makes it a compelling choice for organizations that require high levels of WCRS.\n\nStrengths\u2014This solution offers granular real-time visibility and control over client-side resources at the data element level. It also offers dynamic policy evaluation and enforcement, including advanced security measures such as data firewalls.\n\nLimitations\u2014This solution\u2019s granular nature requires slightly more significant changes to web applications, leading to longer timelines for vetting third-party vendor code, approval, and implementation. To this end, vendor JavaScript code must be trusted by all monitored applications, introducing additional supply chain risk.\n\nVendor Solution Summary\n\nThere are several options available for organizations looking to gain better insights and control over WCRS, depending on organizational security needs. These options\n\nFigure 5 \u2014 Web Client Runtime Security Integration Options\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nOrganizations may consider the pros and cons of each of the above options before selecting solutions for their WCRS objectives. It may be the case that a single solution may not suit every website and organization, given the likely differences in the criticality of the business functions supported by the websites and the sensitivity of the information processed.\n\nThe next and final article (part 3) in this series will cover certain guidelines that organizations may find useful in operationalizing their WCRS programs.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 OWASP, Static Application Security Testing (SAST)\n\n2 OWASP, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)\n\n3 OWASP, Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)\n\nSergei Vasilevsky, CISSP\n\nIs the founder and president of ILIAM Consulting.

This discovery could mean that the Moon still lives, though it isn\u2019t nearly as active as it once was.\n\nImage source: helen_f / Adobe\n\nThis, of course, challenges long-held beliefs that lunar activity ended around 3 billion years ago when the Moon\u2019s molten surface cooled. Scientists previously believed the only changes after this time came from meteor impacts. However, these ridges cut through much younger impact craters, indicating that tectonic activity continued within the last 200 million years.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Scientists believe these maria were created when asteroid impacts triggered massive lava eruptions billions of years ago.\n\nThe far side of the Moon was bombarded more heavily than the near side, leading researchers to assume it cooled and solidified faster. But these new ridges suggest that internal movement continued much later and that the Moon may still live.\n\nThat last point is extremely importantly, as it raises more questions and the evidence points towards another revelation\u2014the Moon is still contracting as it slowly cools. This causes surface wrinkles similar to those seen on a shrinking apple.\n\nBut is the Moon still changing today? Does it still live? Perhaps future manned missions to the Moon will help us determine that or\u2014at the least\u2014provide us with more data to investigate."

            "article_content": "Kore.ai unveils no-code platform for creating and deploying knowledge-based agentic AI\n\nKore.ai, a global leader in enterprise AI, is debuting AI for Process, a no-code, agentic AI platform designed to streamline knowledge-intensive, complex business processes. With AI for Process, enterprises can quickly build, deploy, and manage custom AI agents, or Agentic Apps at scale, that can understand context, make complex decisions, and more.\n\nAutonomous AI agents have struggled to implement its value in highly intricate operations and do so at scale, according to Kore.ai. AI for Process aims to rectify this challenge, transforming rules-based process automation to intelligent process orchestration.\n\n\"Traditional enterprise process automation was limited by rigid, rule-based systems lacking any autonomy,\" said Raj Koneru, CEO and founder of Kore.ai. \"With the advent of advanced AI models capable of evaluation and reasoning, we\u2019re ushering in a new era where intelligent AI agents can independently manage business processes, reducing over-reliance on human support. AI for Process enables enterprises to design scalable, reliable Agentic Apps that redefine efficiency while elevating humans into more strategic, supervisory roles.\"\n\nThrough the help of proprietary agentic RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), AI for Process combines advanced retrieval with intelligent agent orchestration to deliver highly accurate, contextual AI agent technology. Paired with a no-code, highly intuitive visual workflow designer that comes with over 65 pre-built prompt templates, enterprises can achieve the promises of agentic AI with ease.\n\nSpecialized agents work together to intelligently execute a variety of knowledge-based tasks. For example, the Orchestrator Agent coordinates workflows while Reasoning Agents handle complex decision-making; the Task Agents automate workflows, Knowledge Agents process enterprise information, and API Agents manage system integrations.\n\nEach agent is centralized under an advanced Agent Evaluation Framework, ensuring that agents are continuously assessed and analyzed for utmost efficiency and alignment. Furthermore, Kore.ai\u2019s human-in-the-loop strategy incorporates human touchpoints within automated workflows, enabling asynchronous human actions, approvals, and form inputs.\n\nAdditionally, AI for Process seamlessly integrates with commercial and open source large language models (LLMs), as well as major cloud providers\u2014including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud\u2014eliminating vendor lock-in. Kore.ai\u2019s solution offers pre-built connectors for enterprise data sources and APIs and delivers real-time data synchronization across systems.\n\nAs far as security and governance, AI for Process features data anonymization, protection against prompt injection attacks, custom content filters, and audit trails, as well as centralized governance controls for managing role-based access and AI guardrails.\n\n\u201cThe future of enterprise operations lies in AI agents collaborating to manage and optimize processes under human supervision,\u201d said Prasanna Arikala, CTO and head of products at Kore.ai. \u201cThese agents will operate autonomously, seamlessly discovering and working with each other. Achieving this vision requires a robust AI agent platform integrating autonomous agents, advanced knowledge retrieval, and intelligent orchestration. With AI for Process, we\u2019re delivering these future-ready capabilities today.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about AI for Process, please visit https://kore.ai/.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."

            "article_content": "Short-term rental properties will be regulated for the first time in Niskayuna after the Town Board approved a package of regulations on Tuesday.\n\nThe rules will require minimum seven-day bookings at rental homes and mandate that property owners in residential neighborhoods stay overnight at their homes for the duration of their guests\u2019 stays.\n\nThe regulations were approved by a 3-1 margin during the board\u2019s Tuesday night meeting, with board members John Della Ratta, Bill McPartlon and Jason Moskowitz voting in favor of the regulations and board member Jessica Brennan opposed.\n\nTown Supervisor Erin Cassady-Dorion recused herself from the discussions and vote, noting that her family has a personal friendship with Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, a Niskayuna native.\n\nThe rules are effective immediately.\n\nThe town Planning Board began crafting proposed zoning for short-term rentals after a group of town residents brought concerns to the Town Board last spring about a six-bedroom rental property at 1230 Milton Keynes Drive that neighbors said was drawing crowds of out-of-town revelers each weekend.\n\nUnder the restrictions approved by the Town Board on Tuesday, permits will be required for all rental properties. Hosted rentals where the property owner stays on site are permitted in all zoning districts, while unhosted rentals will only be permitted in the town\u2019s neighborhood commercial district.\n\nThe distinction between hosted and unhosted rentals became a sticking point in the Town Board\u2019s deliberations, with the Planning Board recommending the two categories.\n\nThe Town Board held a public hearing on the Planning Board\u2019s proposed zoning in November, then a second hearing on Jan. 14 on an amended set of regulations that removed the seven-day minimum stay and the rule that property owners in residential neighbors must stay overnight during their guests\u2019 bookings.\n\nDella Ratta put forth the original planning board recommendations on Tuesday and the board adopted them.\n\n\u201cI think the hosted rentals is what makes the big difference and keeps the community character intact,\u201d Della Ratta said after Tuesday\u2019s meeting. \u201cWhen it\u2019s unhosted, things kind of go off the rails. But when the homeowner is there, the occupants keep things in control. That was the big factor.\u201d\n\nDella Ratta said Tuesday that he believes the new regulations will solve the issues neighbors have raised about the Milton Keynes property. Current short-term rental properties are not grandfathered in and will face all regulations in the new code.\n\n\u201cAs soon as this goes into effect, then everybody will have to follow them,\u201d Della Ratta said.\n\nBrennan said she would have preferred that the board adopt the regulations that did not include the distinction between hosted and unhosted rentals, noting that the newly approved code includes language that allows the town to pull short-term rental permits from property owners who don\u2019t comply with the new rules.\n\n\u201cI was concerned because we\u2019re going from no code to basically regulating them out of town,\u201d Brennan said on Wednesday. \u201cWe have a piece of the code that says we could revoke a permit immediately for a violation. There\u2019s different steps from a warning all the way to an immediate revocation of the permit. I felt like we didn\u2019t need to restrict it that extremely when we had language in the code that gave the town complete authority to regulate anyone who violates the code.\u201d\n\nMoskowitz said he was torn on the short-term rental restrictions, but ultimately voted in favor of the new rules.\n\nMoskowitz, a real estate agent, said he received feedback from rental owners opposed to the new regulations, but that residents\u2019 concerns over the rentals swayed his vote.\n\n\u201cI thought about it every single day since the original draft was shown to us [last year] and there were some days I was 150% for it and there were other days where I was adamantly against it and that it was something that we really shouldn\u2019t be entertaining,\u201d Moskowitz said after Tuesday\u2019s meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re elected to protect the quality of life for our residents, and the residents on Milton Keynes and those surrounding streets in the neighborhood really don\u2019t seem to have a quality of life and they came to us begging for help. So as their elected representatives, how do we not help them?\u201d\n\nThe new regulations limit the number of vehicles allowed on a rental property to one per rented bedroom, with a limit of four vehicles total on any property. Town residents have complained about rental properties attracting a dozen vehicles on summer weekends, crowding town streets.\n\nThe rental code also limits the number of guests to two per bedroom rented, with weddings, corporate events and commercial functions barred at short-term rental properties.\n\nUnder the new regulations, residents can file complaints about short-term rental properties with the town building department, with town code officers to handle potential violations with potential suspension or revocation of rental permits.\n\nResident Natalie Tiberio noted during Tuesday\u2019s meeting that Niskayuna has not historically been a municipality like Saratoga Springs that is a tourist destination that may necessitate more short-term rentals.\n\n\u201cNiskayuna has traditionally been a quiet, suburban bedroom community where residents live primarily for the peaceful atmosphere, often commuting to other areas for work,\u201d she told the board.\n\nUnder the new regulations, the town will publish a list of short-term rental properties in the town on its website each quarter.\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s a good starting point for us for short-term rentals in the town of Niskayuna,\u201d McPartlon said during the Tuesday meeting. \u201cSome people came forward and said they didn\u2019t want any short-term rentals, none at all. We got legal opinions that it wouldn\u2019t really be possible, so the Planning Board put a code together and I think they did an exceptional job.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Top of the Champions League table and into the last 16 with the most money banked.\n\nThis was the perfect return to Europe\u2019s elite competition for Liverpool, setting up Arne Slot\u2019s side for a crack at lifting the trophy for a seventh time and significantly boosting the club\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nAfter recording seven wins out of eight games, Liverpool are closing in on at least \u20ac100million (\u00a383.8m; $104m) in Champions League prize money alone, with a further \u20ac56.5m still to play for. Factor in the additional matchday revenue that big fixtures at Anfield bring \u2014 the club earn between \u00a33m and \u00a34m for each home game, with sellout crowds as good as guaranteed \u2014 and the importance of being back in Europe\u2019s premier competition after a year away becomes clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlot will rightly focus on his side\u2019s positive on-field performances, which included memorable victories against Real Madrid, Milan and Bayer Leverkusen, but the influx of such a large amount of cash will fuel the angst among the fans who want to see greater investment from Fenway Sports Group (FSG, the club\u2019s owner).\n\nSeeing that money flow in certainly makes it harder for FSG to stick so resolutely to its careful approach to spending. Such prudence could easily be justified last season, when Liverpool were playing in the Europa League while building the new Anfield Road End (which took capacity to over 60,000), but less so now.\n\nYet history suggests that more money coming into the club does not always equate to a big investment in the squad. FSG places sustainability at the heart of its operations and prefers to wait for the right player to become available, rather than being lured into overspending. An example came last summer with Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi: he was Liverpool's top transfer target but, when that deal could not be done, they opted not to go for an alternative in his defensive midfield position.\n\nThere is no sign it will stretch the club beyond its means anytime soon, despite seeing the value of its asset multiply considerably since its \u00a3300m takeover in 2010.\n\nLiverpool were the lowest spenders in last summer's transfer window, signing only Federico Chiesa for a deal worth up to \u00a312.5m. A \u00a329m deal for goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili was also agreed, although he stayed at Valencia until the end of this season, and with four days of the current transfer window remaining, Liverpool are yet to do any business.\n\nFederico Chiesa was Liverpool's only summer arrival (Jan Kruger/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cPeople haven\u2019t seen us do a lot in the transfer window but we\u2019re happy with the squad,\" Slot told the BBC this week. \"In the background, we are working on strengthening the squad for the summer. That would mean that for the upcoming years, we will be able to challenge for every trophy we are playing for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKey to the future are also the three soon-to-be out-of-contract players \u2014 Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk \u2014 available to discuss free moves away this summer when their deals expire.\n\nSalah, Alexander-Arnold and Van Dijk have been offered extensions but are yet to agree terms. Tension among the Anfield crowd continues to grow, with a recent banner reading, \u201cNow give Mo his dough,\u201d referencing the importance of FSG securing Salah beyond this season.\n\nOf course such negotiations aren\u2019t that simple. Neither is it as straightforward to suggest that now Liverpool are doing well in the Champions League again, they should break from a structure that, despite criticism, has served them well over the years.\n\nThere is still a little catching up to do, too. Liverpool dropped a place in the annual Deloitte Football Money League this year as the impact of no Champions League football last season was laid bare.\n\nAccording to the figures, which are expected to be backed up when the club's official accounts are released, total revenue was up to around \u20ac714m, an increase on the previous season, which had stood at \u00a3594m. Much of that was down to a \u20ac45m increase in commercial revenue and a \u20ac29m boost to matchday revenue, helped by the opening of the new Anfield Road Stand.\n\nA \u20ac42m drop in broadcast revenue, however, highlighted the missed opportunity in the Champions League and allowed Arsenal to leapfrog Liverpool in the standings.\n\nThat Liverpool are back in the competition and the favourites to win it, is a good start to the recovery. Never before has it been more important to be in the competition than now with the prize pot bubbling away.\n\nAnfield makes huge sums for every home game (Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nA 22 per cent increase in the money distributed from UEFA this year means that if Liverpool lift the trophy in May they can expect to earn around \u20ac160m. First they will have to progress through the last-16 against either Paris Saint-Germain, Benfica, Monaco or Brest. But even finishing as a runner-up or semi-finalist may be enough to record Liverpool's most profitable season in Europe, largely because of their early form and history in the competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs The Athletic's Phil Buckingham explained in more detail, the prize pot is split in three ways: first through an equal share (\u20ac18.62m for each club), then performance-related extras before a third part \u2014 a new 'value pillar' shaped by market pools and coefficients \u2014 completes the total.\n\nWe already know what some of these figures are in advance so they can be totted up along the way. Each win is worth \u20ac2.1m, with a draw bringing \u20ac700,000, then additional payments are made for the final league position, qualifying for the last 16 (\u20ac11m), the quarter-finals (\u20ac12.5m), the semi-finals (\u20ac15m) and the final (\u20ac18.5m). The winners also get \u20ac6.5m, as well as an additional \u20ac4m for featuring in the following season's European Super Cup.\n\nLiverpool's total for performance payments currently stands at almost \u20ac40m. The value pillar is the more complex of the three and relates to the size of each club\u2019s domestic TV deal and historical performances in Europe. Liverpool were among the highest and are expected to bring in around \u20ac40million, which, added to their on-field performance, represents a good start to 2025.\n\nThe club's accountants will be thrilled, and Slot himself does not seem to be agitating for the kind of spending that some of his Premier League rivals are indulging in.\n\nBut given the sums pouring in, another quiet summer would lead to more awkward questions being asked of FSG and its long-term ambitions.\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"

Whether DeepSeek fundamentally upends those plans remains to be seen. But at a bare minimum, it has shaken investors who have poured money into OpenAI, a company that reportedly believes it won't turn a profit until the end of the decade.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman concedes that the DeepSeek R1 model is \"impressive,\" but the company is taking steps to protect its models (both language and business); OpenAI told the Financial Times and other outlets that it believed DeepSeek had used output from OpenAI's models to train the R1 model, a method known as \"distillation.\" Using OpenAI's models to train a model that will compete with OpenAI's models is a violation of the company's terms of service.\n\n\"We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the US government to protect the most capable models being built here,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told Ars.\n\nSo taking data without permission is bad, now?\n\nI'm not here to say whether the R1 model is the product of distillation. What I can say is that it's a little rich for OpenAI to suddenly be so very publicly concerned about the sanctity of proprietary data."

            "article_content": "Emergency response teams are scrambling to rescue passengers involved in a mid-air collision between a passenger plane and a US Army helicopter in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe incident happened late on Wednesday evening when the plane crashed with a Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk as it approached Ronald Reagan Washingotn National Airport. The plane, a Bombadier CRJ700, had departed from Wichita, Kansas.\n\nThe Black Hawk helicopter had left Fort Belvoir, Virginia and had three US soldiers aboard on a training flight. CBS has reported that 18 people have been confirmed as dead but the final death toll will likely be significantly higher. Investigators are still struggling to establish the cause of the crash.\n\nWhat is the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter?\n\nThe \u2018Black Hawk\u2019 helicopter is one of the most storied in US military history and it has been in active use since 1979. The prototype was submitted by Sikorsky Aircraft in 1972 and was selected by the US Army in 1976, and given the moniker UH-60.\n\nSince then it have proven remarkably tough, used in ware zones around the world and being tasked with some of the most difficult air missions in US military history. The Black Hawk features self-sealing, crash-resistant fuel tanks that limit the risk posed by small-arms fire in conflict zone. The tail rotor blade design includes ballistically resilient materials and the cockpit has an armoured shell.\n\nWith two engines and a four-blade propeller the Black Hawk is also surprisingly fast, capable of cruising at over 100mph and lifting 8,0000 pounds. The design also allows it to be broken down easily and transported in heavy-lift aircrafts, meaning that it can be quickly deployed wherever in the world it is needed.\n\nBlack Hawk US military history\n\nOver the past 45 years the Black Hawk has been used in combat in Grenada, Panama, Iraq, Ukraine, the Balkans and Afghanistan, amongst other countries.\n\nThe most famous use, however, was in the Somalia where a Black Hawk helicopter was shot down in 1993. The crew were attempting to capture Somalian faction leader Mohamed Farrah Aidad but ended up in a close combat battle in Mogadishu, the country\u2019s capital. The incident was immortalised in the Mark Bowden book \u2018Black Hawk Down\u2019, later turned into a Ridley Scott film. That was the most cinematic of the Black Hawk\u2019s military escapades across nearly a half-century of action.\n\nGet your game on!

            "article_content": "Analysts warn that stretched valuations and weakening credit cycles signal further downside risks.\n\nHeightened volatility, an FII sell-off, and tightening liquidity have caused the markets to enter a sharp corrective territory. However, the small- and mid-cap segment of the equities has taken a sharper fall compared to their large-cap peers, falling as much as 15 percent since the end of September.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe BSE400 small and midcap index is poised for its fifth 20 percent-plus correction post-GFC.\n\nIs this a blip or a bear market?\n\nHowever, is this fall a blip or a serious correction? According to analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities, this downturn could be the beginning of a bear market as domestic growth slows and durable liquidity slips into a deficit. Further, despite the 15 percent correction, SMID valuations are still high.\n\nThe past corrections can be classified as blips, such as those seen in 2015\u201316 and 2021\u201322 or bear markets, which was seen in 2011\u201313 and 2018\u201319.\n\nAs per Nuvama Institutional Equities, blips are short-lived, lasting two\u2013three quarters as SMIDs fall in line with large-caps. On the other hand, bear markets are prolonged correction phases with a 30\u201340 percent correction over two\u2013three years and large underperformance to the Nifty 50 and Sensex.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nDuring blips, all sectors decline, with little difference in sectoral performance. However, during bear markets cyclicals (real estate and industrials) tend to experience large underperformance and usually tend to correct by more than 50 percent.\n\nFurther, the brokerage noted that SMIDs are more exposed to the domestic economy than large-caps. Thus, it is only when domestic growth slackens do SMIDs tend to experience bear market and correct.\n\n\"The best way to assess the same is by looking at the domestic credit cycle and exports trend. If the credit cycle is weakening, then it is a sign of domestic weakness in which SMIDs will invariably underperform,\" said Nuvama analysts.\n\nBear markets are preceded by large 5Y returns (20 percent or above) while blips occur in the initial phases of bull markets and tend to have 10\u201315 percent 5Y returns in the run-up. Therefore, bear markets typically occur when domestic credit slows, liquidity tightens and midcaps experience a strong five-year rally on an absolute as well as relative basis.\n\nAlso Read | Budget cheer coming for railways? RVNL, Railtel, other rail stocks surge ahead of Budget 2025\n\nBlips on the other hand are an outcome of global weakness while domestic growth and liquidity conditions are generally stable. Furthermore, they are not preceded by a large medium-term rally.\n\nSo is this current correction a blip or bear market? Most signs point towards the SMIDs space entering a bear market. Domestic growth that is slackening this, which is evident in the credit cycle, while it was strong in 2023, in H1CY24 it has experienced a sharp moderation.\n\nAlso, excluding BFSI, SMID earnings are now underperforming large-cap peers and have moved into contraction. \"In fact, even in the Q3FY25 results season so far, SMID earnings have been disappointing and experienced large downgrades,\" noted the brokerage.\n\nThe performance of SMIDs relative to the Nifty 50 have been the highest in a post GFC-world. Even after the correction, they remain quite elevated \u2013 a trend that is typically observed in market corrections preceding bear markets.\n\nWith a sharp run up comes stretched valuations. Even, after the 15 percent correction, valuations are higher than the previous peaks.\n\nWay forward\n\nAs domestic growth is slackening, liquidity conditions are tightening and valuations as well as 5Y returns are quite elevated, Nuvama Institutional Equities believes there could be risks of a bear market. \"These have higher resemblance to the 2011\u201313 and 2018\u201319 phases. Thus, it is perhaps not yet a time to buy the dip,\" noted analysts.\n\nThe reversal from the previous bear markets, especially in 2018\u201319, was due to the US Federal Reserve. Hence, it is very important to monitor Fed actions and global liquidity hereon, as that will shape the SMIDs outcome.\n\nInvestors should maintain a very low beta bias as growth is still subdued and liquidity remains tight. \"In sectors, where margins are close to cyclical lows, and demand has stabilised, we think consolidation/costs focus could happen and those stocks/sectors could see larger upside,\" said Nuvama, adding, \"Despite the sharp correction, we recommend avoiding cyclical exposure in SMID portfolio.\"\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

            "article_content": "A recent study conducted by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay analyzed the financial impact of floods and cyclones across 25 states in India. The study, which covers a span of 23 years (1995\u20132018), highlights how the damage caused by these natural disasters severely affects the states\u2019 budgets on an annual basis. The research also offers solutions for better disaster preparedness and economic protection, providing a roadmap to help mitigate the financial repercussions of such crises.\n\nPublished in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, the study titled, \u2018The impact of floods and cyclones on fiscal arrangements in India: An empirical investigation at the sub-national level\u2019 is conducted by Nandini Suresh,a research scholar with the Center for Climate Studies, IIT Bombay, Professor Trupti Mishra, and Professor D. Parthasarathy of IIT Bombay.\n\nAlso Read | Natural disasters caused 2.5 million internal displacements in India in 2022, report says\n\nTraditionally, disaster response funding relies on estimating the cost of damages based on evaluating economic losses, the number of deaths, and the number of people affected. \u201cThese evaluations are often inconsistent and biased,\u201c Ms. Suresh said. \u201cWe relied on data from weather and geographic sources [IBTrACS and the India Meteorological Department] to accurately measure cyclone strength [using wind speeds] and flood severity [based on unusual rainfall],\u201d she explained.\n\nBy combining this information, the researchers created a Disaster Intensity Index (DII), ensuring all types of disasters are treated fairly. This method avoids inconsistencies and biases and gives a clearer picture of disaster impacts, especially for floods and cyclones, which caused 80% of disaster-related losses in India during the study period.\n\nThe study uses a statistical model called panel Vector Auto Regression (VAR) to examine how revenue and expenditure affect each other from one year to the next few years. The model allows accounting for differences between states and ensures that past economic conditions do not unfairly influence disaster severity measurements, giving a reliable way to study the financial impacts of disasters.\n\nAlso Read | Wanted: a strategy to turn climate research into disaster management\n\nThe findings from the study show that disasters put a heavy financial burden on the affected States by increasing their expenditure while also reducing their revenue. As a result, the States allocate substantial funds for immediate relief efforts such as evacuation, medical aid, food, and shelter. The government also invests in rebuilding essential infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and homes. As agriculture, trade, and business operations are frequently disrupted by these disasters, tax collection and income from these sectors also decline.\n\nThe study highlights a cycle in which increased expenditures and falling revenues lead to significant budget deficits.\n\nMs. Mishra said, \u201cHowever, the DII shows that disasters impact States differently. Less disaster-prone States like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which experience droughts and occasional floods, can handle relief with their own resources and suffer less financial damage. The disaster intensity is not high enough to affect people\u2019s income or production; hence, there is no decrease in tax or non-tax revenues. On the other hand, disaster-prone coastal States like Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal, which frequently experience cyclones and floods, have higher recovery expenses and higher revenue losses. As a result, they often need to rely on external funding like loans, increasing state debt and making it difficult to fund other development projects.\u201d\n\nThe assistance offered by the National and State Disaster Response Funds (NDRF and SDRF) could be optimised for improved efficiency and faster disbursal. \u201cCertain regulations, such as the 25% cap on SDRF allocations for relief operations and some procedural requirements, may create hurdles in utilising these funds in a timely manner. By simplifying these processes, there may be an opportunity to enhance the overall impact of disaster relief initiatives,\u201d Mr. Parthasarathy said.\n\nThe study emphasises the need for proactive disaster risk financing mechanisms such as resilience bonds, disaster insurance, and catastrophe bonds.\n\nResilience bonds encourage investments in disaster prevention projects and offer incentives for reducing the effects of disasters. Disaster insurance supports individuals, companies, or governments in recovering from losses brought on by natural disasters. Catastrophe bonds allow governments or organisations to shift disaster risk to investors who receive interest unless a disaster occurs. \u201cThese provide quick funds during emergencies and reduce the need to take external loans after disasters,\u201d Ms. Nandini said.\n\nOpinion | The lapses in the disaster management Bill\n\nHowever, implementing such measures in India is challenging due to a lack of awareness and understanding among stakeholders, including governments and the public, about the benefits of such instruments, she added. The other key challenges include the high cost of disaster insurance premiums and a lack of a clear financial and legal framework for issuing resilience bonds or incorporating them into state budgets.\n\nPublic-private partnerships are also essential for building a climate-resilient economy. Governments can offer tax incentives for businesses to invest in climate resilience infrastructure and enforce sustainability regulations.\n\nDiverting funds from other projects is a usual way for governments to handle disasters while staying within budget. However, it is difficult to move money from fixed expenses like debt payments, salaries, or pensions as these take up most of the budget and are already set by law. Governments need flexible budgets, backup plans, and quick ways to adjust spending based on what is required so that they can quickly reallocate funds during emergencies.\n\nOpinion | India\u2019s disaster management story as a work in progress\n\n\u201cThe states need to invest in early warning systems, cyclone shelters, and resilient infrastructure and promote sustainable land use that can minimise the economic impact of climate change and lower the long-term costs of dealing with disasters. Many states have already made progress: Tamil Nadu has installed advanced cyclone monitoring systems, Kerala has adopted climate-adaptive urban planning, and Odisha and many others have introduced budget tracking for climate-related spending,\u201d Ms. Nandini said.\n\nWith climate change driving an increase in the frequency and intensity of disasters, the researchers warned that Indian states will face even greater financial challenges in the future. However, by adopting the recommended measures, they believe India can mitigate long-term financial risks, protect lives and infrastructure, and work toward building a stronger, more sustainable future."

            "article_content": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $500 million policy-based loan aimed at providing the Philippine government with quick access to financing for disaster response and recovery in the event of natural disasters or health-related emergencies. This program is designed to support ongoing reforms that will boost the country\u2019s disaster resilience, ensuring timely recovery efforts to mitigate the impact of disasters on the economy and people's lives.\n\nStrengthening Disaster Resilience and Response Capacity\n\nThe Second Disaster Resilience Improvement Program is a multiyear contingent disaster financing program with the option to replenish the funds twice, subject to approval by the ADB Board. Renewals are allowed if there are unused funds following the initial 5-year term.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines is one of the fastest growing economies in Southeast Asia but is at high risk for earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons, rising sea levels, and flooding,\u201d said Pavit Ramachandran, ADB Country Director for the Philippines. \u201cWith this program, we aim to help boost the country\u2019s capacity for disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) nationally and locally, including for state-owned and controlled corporations; strengthen DRRM policies and frameworks; and attain long-term resilience to lessen the impact of disasters, especially for the most vulnerable sectors.\u201d\n\nAddressing the Philippines' High Disaster Risk\n\nAccording to the World Risk Report 2024, the Philippines ranks as the highest in disaster risk among 193 countries. At least 60% of the country\u2019s land area is exposed to multiple hazards, and nearly three-fourths of the population is at risk from these threats. The country experiences at least 20 typhoons annually and an average of 150 earthquakes of at least magnitude 4 each year.\n\nKey Program Objectives\n\nThe new program will focus on the following key objectives:\n\nHarmonizing DRRM planning processes across national, provincial, and city levels, integrating disaster risk reduction into the broader public financial management (PFM) reforms.\n\nIncorporating gender equity, disability, and social inclusion into DRRM plans to ensure the most vulnerable communities are supported.\n\nEnhancing the disaster response capabilities of state-owned corporations, ensuring they are better equipped to support recovery efforts.\n\nIntroducing additional sources of financing, such as a voluntary city parametric disaster insurance scheme, which enables faster payouts for damages caused by earthquakes, typhoons, and other natural hazards.\n\nBuilding on Previous Reforms and Past ADB Support\n\nThis new program builds on the achievements of the first Disaster Resilience Improvement Program, as well as ADB\u2019s past assistance in climate and disaster resilience. Notably, ADB has supported initiatives like the Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (KALAHI-CIDSS) program, which addressed post-disaster recovery needs at the community level.\n\nThe program also complements ADB\u2019s Integrated Flood Resilience and Adaptation Project (Phase 1), which is helping local government units (LGUs) prepare and implement disaster risk management plans to reduce their vulnerability to floods and other disasters. Additionally, it strengthens efforts outlined in the Climate Change Action Plan Subprograms 1 and 2, which focus on implementing national climate policies and scaling up climate adaptation and mitigation projects at both national and local levels.\n\nA Critical Part of ADB's Ongoing Support to the Philippines\n\nThe program represents a central component of ADB\u2019s ongoing support to the Philippines in its efforts to improve disaster resilience and sustainable recovery. By enhancing disaster preparedness and risk financing mechanisms, the Philippines will be better equipped to respond to future disasters while building a more resilient economy and society."

            "article_content": "Getty Image\n\nA wild, rather star-studded sports-related antitrust trial is currently taking place in a Brooklyn federal court. The case being litigated is the defunct second version of the North American Soccer League (NASL) versus the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) and Major League Soccer (MLS).\n\nThe North American Soccer League, led by its former chairman Rocco Commisso, the billionaire founder, CEO, and owner of cable company Mediacom, is seeking up to $170 million in damages from USSF and MLS. The amount would be tripled if NASL gets a favorable verdict, as is the case in all antitrust lawsuits.\n\nWhen the trial first began earlier this month, among those who were expected to testify were MLS commissioner Don Garber, FC Dallas and Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, Big East commissioner Val Ackerman (a former USSF board member), and former NBA star Carmelo Anthony, who owned the NASL Puerto Rico FC franchise.\n\nCommisso, who owned the NASL New York Cosmos franchise and still owns ACF Fiorentina, and NASL attorney Jeff Kessler claim that MLS and USSF conspired to stop NASL from competing with MLS and then conspired to remove the soccer league\u2019s Division II status, leading to it folding in 2018.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the trial so far, occurred this week when Kessler, who is also representing Michael Jordan in his race team\u2019s lawsuit against NASCAR, asked Commisso about a Twitter account that used to make derogatory statements about the USSF and MLS.\n\nCommisso, who previously admitted during the lawsuit\u2019s discovery phase that he ran the account anonymously, said he created the account so his posts wouldn\u2019t interfere with his media company\u2019s business. He also admitted creating a second anonymous Twitter account, and, Front Office Sports reports, ordered a public relations executive at Mediacom to post negative things about MLS and USSF on that account.\n\nAmong the tweets Rocco Commisso wrote on Twitter using the anonymous \u201cGlobal Soccer Fan\u201d account was one in which he wrote, \u201cUSSF has been raped by the Harvey Weinstein of US Soccer \u2013 Garber, who with MLS owners and Gulati, have engineered a Madoff-type scam on all of American soccer.\u201d\n\nCommisso was referring to MLS commissioner Don Garber, USSF president Sunil Gulati, convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein and Bernie Madoff, mastermind of the largest known Ponzi scheme in history.\n\nWhen asked by Ruskin, \u201cYou chose to equate someone with rape over a business grievance where you didn\u2019t get what you wanted, correct? That\u2019s when you decided to do this, yes or no?\u201d Commisso replied \u201cYes\u201d to both questions."

            "article_content": "Never before had cleaning off so shaped history. But when an Egyptian princess went to take a quick dip in the Nile, her discovery and rescue of baby Moses in his basket set the Israelites on their path toward that eventual dramatic escape from the shackles of Egypt.\n\nThe second chapter of Exodus sets the scene: \u201cThe daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her attendants walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid (amatah) to bring it. When she opened it, she saw the child. He was crying, and she took pity on him. \u2018This must be one of the Hebrews\u2019 children,\u2019 she said.\u201d\n\nMiriam, Moses\u2019 sister, having held out hope at the riverbank that somehow her brother might sail past the clutches of Pharaoh\u2019s decree that all male Jewish children be slaughtered, saw what unfolded and helpfully offered to find a nursemaid to suckle the child. That volunteer caretaker she recommended, of course, was secretly Moses\u2019 biological mother, Yocheved. Moses then grew up in the palace of the king but with the spiritual and national mentorship of his Jewish family, uniquely positioning him to lead his people to freedom.\n\nThe act of warm-heartedness of this unnamed Egyptian was, ever since, celebrated by the Jewish tradition.\n\nMoses\u2019s rescue-by-princess was depicted on the western wall of the ruins of the ancient synagogue ruins found in Dura-Europos, modern-day Syria, in a rendering dated to the mid-third century C.E. In it, Pharaoh is off to the side, seated on his throne. A scribe next to him writes down the royal commands \u2014 no doubt the order to execute babies, the very edict his own daughter disobeys.\n\nRabbinic texts also parsed every aspect of the brief episode. Why did she need to go bathe, they wondered? Sefer HaYashar suggests a sunburn. God had sent a heatwave, which seared the Egyptians and left them seeking a means of cooling off. Perhaps, came another conjecture, she had that awful skin disease, tzara\u2019at. Thus Shemot Rabbah\u2019s proposal that \u201cPharaoh\u2019s daughter was a leper; that is why she went to bathe. When she touched the basket she was cured. That is why she had compassion for Moses and loved him exceedingly.\u201d\n\nPirkei deRebbe Eliezer adds that her sensitive skin required the cold Nile water, as opposed to the warm water of an indoor facility. Her subsequent reward, though unspecified in the Bible itself, was eternal bliss \u2013 \u201cWhosoever preserves a life is as though he had kept alive the whole world. Therefore was she worthy to (inherit) the life in this world and the life in the world to come.\u201d Mystical texts record her entering the heavenly realm alive, sitting alongside Elijah and the Messiah.\n\nThe Talmud, in turn, senses a sign of her personal fealty to the Jewish cause as an aspiring convert to the faith. \u201cRabbi Yohanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai: This teaches that she came down to the river to cleanse herself from the impurity of her father\u2019s idols, as she was immersing herself as part of the conversion process.\u201d\n\nNo doubt miracles enabled the shocking rescue. She felt compelled to head to the site because of a dream, offered the first-century work Biblical Antiquities. Other texts add that the princess saw the Divine Presence hovering above Moses. When her maidens tried to convince her not to save him, the angel Gabriel came from heaven and struck them down. Though perhaps it wasn\u2019t a maiden she sent to grab the basket, but rather her arm stretched many cubits (amot) to enable her to grab it.\n\nAnother Talmudic tractate gives the anonymous-in-the-Bible heroine a name reflecting her loyalty to Israel\u2019s God. Actually, two names. She was called Bityah (\u201cGod\u2019s daughter) or Yehudiyah (\u201cJewess\u201d).\n\nWas she even Pharaoh\u2019s biological daughter? A surprising Midrash Talpiot argued that she was not. Rather, she and Moses\u2019 future wife Tziporah were Moses\u2019 biological sisters (!). The former was seized by force by the Egyptian king, and the latter by Jethro, Pharaoh\u2019s adviser and Moses\u2019 eventual father-in-law, and raised in their respective homes. (Lest one be shocked that Moses, according to this text, eventually married his sister, the midrash notes that this was permissible prior to Sinai, and Tziporah was uniquely righteous.)\n\nOf course, suggests the Arukh HaShulchan, Pharaoh\u2019s daughter was spared the death of the firstborn \u2014 the 10th of those notorious Plagues \u2014 in the merit of Moshe, whose life she had saved.\n\nMoses undoubtedly expressed gratitude for the rescue. As the scholar of the Second Temple period Malka Simkovich has noted, Ezekiel the Tragedian, a second- or first-century B.C.E. Jew who lived in Egypt, composed a Greek play whose verses have Moses reminiscing how: \u201cThroughout my boyhood years the princess did, for princely rearing and instruction apt, provide all things, as though I were her own, the circle of the days then being full.\u201d\n\nSimkovich also notes that the second century BCE Book of Jubilees calls Bityah a different name, Thermuthis, as does the historian Josephus. A popular Greek name for Egyptian women at the time, it\u2019s a variation of the Egyptian Renen\u016btet, the Egyptian goddess of nourishment, from the verb meaning \u201cto nurse or rear,\u201d a fitting appellation for the adoptive figure.\n\nIn Josephus\u2019 dramatic detailing, after the extraordinary rescue, she hoped Moses would himself become king: \u201c\u2026 one day she brought Moses to her father and showed him to him, and told him how she had been mindful for the succession, were it God\u2019s will to grant her no child of her own, by bringing up a boy of divine beauty and generous spirit, and by what a miracle she had received him of the river\u2019s bounty, \u2018and I thought,\u2019 she said, \u2018to make him my child and heir to your kingdom.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlas, in playing with his adopted grandson, Pharaoh freaks out. \u201cTo please his daughter, [he] placed his diadem upon [Moses\u2019] head. But Moses tore it off and flung it to the ground, in mere childishness, and trampled it underfoot; and this was taken as an omen of evil import to the kingdom.\u201d\n\nWhen the adult Moses led his people to liberation, Bityah joined her now-fellow Jews and went too. In her old age, she married Caleb, who, alongside Joshua, encouraged the desert-wandering Israelite tribes to ignore the bad report of the spies who had returned from scouting the Promised Land. As the Talmud tells it, \u201cThe Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let Caleb, who rebelled against the advice of the spies, come and marry the daughter of Pharaoh, who rebelled against the idols of her father\u2019s home.\u201d\n\nModern literary scholars have suggested the princess\u2019 salvation foreshadows God\u2019s own extension of His saving hands to His people. Pharaoh\u2019s daughter\u2019s coming down and seeing a baby crying is mirrored by God\u2019s actions in Exodus\u2019 third chapter, which has Him telling the now adult Moses \u201cI have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out \u2026 So I have come down to rescue them.\u201d\n\nThe bath of Bityah (or Yehudiyah or Thermuthis) then, even without the rabbinic accounts of the many miracles involved in her saving of Moses and subsequent religious conversion, offers a model for those non-palace-dwellers of us to follow. If her dunk to cool off on that hot Egyptian afternoon teaches us anything, it\u2019s that small acts of kindness to the other might very well draw forth God\u2019s salvation for us all.\n\nRabbi Dr. Stuart Halpern is Senior Adviser to the Provost of Yeshiva University and Deputy Director of Y.U.\u2019s Straus Center for Torah and Western Thought.

            "article_content": "During World War II, American submarines in the Pacific proved effective at slipping past enemy patrols, mounting surprise attacks on vulnerable targets and dodging retaliation, flexing the power of their stealth as they destroyed supply lines and naval fleets of the Imperial Japanese Navy. As submarine detection technology evolved over the last century, introducing passive and active sonar, surface-scanning radar, and magnetic anomaly detectors, submarines only got stealthier.\n\nYet one practical issue is stymying America\u2019s progress toward the ultimate undersea stealth platform: submarines must creep near the surface every few weeks to reorientate themselves and maintain accurate navigation.\n\nBecause the radio waves emitted from GPS satellites cannot penetrate water, subs rely on a method called inertial navigation (also known as \u201cdead-reckoning\u201d) to determine their position, orientation, and velocity. But due to a phenomenon known as integration drift, these systems gradually lose accuracy over time; small errors in measuring angular velocity and acceleration compound until they become massive errors. So, every few weeks, submarines must expose themselves at the surface to allow a retractable satellite antenna to retrieve GPS data, effectively course-correcting the ship.\n\nHowever, this indiscretion time near the surface not only breaks a submarine\u2019s stealth, but may prove pointless in the end, should an enemy destroy or jam satellite navigation signals. As such, the U.S. Navy has been scrambling toward a quantum physics-based solution that could not only help submarines sense where they are without having to risk exposure near the surface, but also elevate their tactical advantage in anti-submarine warfare and intelligence-gathering. If implemented, this technology could buttress the operation of sensors and navigation systems, extend detection range, and greatly enhance computing power.\n\nBut the real trick will be putting quantum sensors onto subs before China does. Otherwise China could beat the U.S. in developing spy technology that can see our subs long before we see them.\n\nTypically, submarines leverage several methods to remain concealed: the massive volume of ocean water, acoustic silence, and measures to reduce their electromagnetic signature\u2014the distortions created by the metal of the vessel\u2019s hull.\n\nBut if quantum technology becomes the standard, these methods will no longer be enough.\n\nCurrently, detecting submerged submarines with sonar or electromagnetic sensors requires relative physical proximity\u2014but two odd properties of quantum physics could greatly increase detection range.\n\nOne of them is quantum entanglement. This refers to the odd phenomenon by which one particle\u2019s behavior can be closely related, or \u201centangled,\u201d with another, potentially distant particle. That makes it possible for some quantum sensors that read nearby particles to also provide information on the activity of a faraway particle.\n\nSecondly, quantum superposition\u2014the ability to maintain more than one state simultaneously\u2014would potentially facilitate an exponential increase in computing power for onboard instruments that receive sensor data. Today\u2019s quantum computers already do this, storing data not only like a classical computer that works in binary (either 0 or 1), but in qubits, which consider additional possibilities such as both 0 and 1 simultaneously.\n\nCurrently, detection instruments called gravimeters and magnetometers enable detection of the submarines several hundred feet away. However, they can be adapted, using quantum technology, to detect subs from several miles away.\n\nQuantum gravimeters are already used in multiple fields, including for the study of volcanoes and melting ice sheets. They detect miniscule gravitational fields by sensing how they \u201cpull\u201d free-falling atoms that have been laser-cooled and super-positioned into multiple states simultaneously. Adapted for a submarine, a quantum -equipped magnetometer could be used to read the subtle variations of the Earth\u2019s magnetic fields like a map. Because it accurately determines position, it would obviate a submarine\u2019s need for indiscretion time near the surface.\n\nQuantum sensors might also give submarines a new tool to quietly detect enemies without resorting to noisy active sonar. And, such sensors would provide the means to receive more detailed communication signals while more deeply submerged. A quantum gravimeter could also be used to more accurately detect and analyze enemy transmissions, since the quantum tech could simultaneously survey a broader bandwidth than is possible using traditional systems.\n\nFurthermore, quantum navigation might\u2014if sufficiently miniaturized\u2014also enable long-range weapons to precisely strike a target over huge distances, even when denied satellite navigation access.\n\nToday, submarine-hunting aircraft use conventional magnetometers that are mostly effective just above half a mile. However, engineers have come up with a type of magnetometer called a SQUID (for Superconducting Quantum Interference Device), which has the potential to boost detection range to 3.7 miles\u2014hypothetically covering over a hundred times more surface area. SQUID technology for submarine detection could eventually become lighter, smaller, and more practical, and offer orders-of-magnitude higher resolution than conventional magnetometers.\n\nLastly, quantum technology\u2019s potential to massively increase computing power could one day enable autonomous submarine combat missions\u2014without the need for a crew. The first relatively large, fully autonomous XLUUV-class drone submarines are entering U.S. military service to perform specialized missions. But more powerful AI with quantum computing might enable XLUUVs to perform a wider range of combat missions at a fraction of the cost and size of manned submarines.\n\nQuantum detection sensors could give vessels plying the surface of the water an advantage, too. Installing such sensors on patrolling aircraft carriers or transport ships could make it very dangerous for submarines to infiltrate close to key targets.\n\nWhen it comes to spearheading the naval arms race towards quantum sensor integration, China appears to be winning. However, the U.S. and its allies in the Pacific and Europe are also making major investments in quantum technologies for naval warfare, with France being first to adopt quantum gravimeters for operational use in 2024.\n\nTo date, the nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational Information Technology and Innovation Foundation estimates that China\u2019s government has spent over $15 billion on quantum research\u2014though the figure is debated, as Beijing\u2019s budgeting is notoriously opaque. The U.S. has reportedly spent $3.8 billion.\n\nThough Congress has passed resolutions calling on the Pentagon to close the gap with China, U.S. defense spending on quantum systems remains tentative, due to the immaturity of many existing quantum technologies.\n\nSetting aside long-term developments, quantum technologies seem poised to render submarines more vulnerable to detection in the mid-term. But it\u2019s far too early to tell whether quantum technology will give submarine hunters an enduring edge, or be just another temporary leg up in a continually evolving technological arms race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "The contemporary workforce is undergoing a seismic shift, transitioning from a reliance on manual labour towards a pronounced demand for digital proficiency. This paradigm shift, catalysed by the inexorable rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, necessitates a proactive approach to workforce development to ensure future economic prosperity.\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Future of Jobs Report underscores this urgency, projecting the displacement of 92 million jobs while simultaneously creating 170 million new roles, largely contingent upon digital literacy.\n\nRecognising this impending transformation, the Imo State government under the leadership of Governor Hope Uzodimma, has taken a pioneering stride with the establishment of SkillUpImo, a comprehensive human capacity and digital skills literacy programme.\n\nThis initiative, spearheaded by the Ministry of Digital Economy and e-Government, represents a strategic investment in the state\u2019s human capital, positioning Imo at the forefront of the digital revolution in Nigeria, Africa, and the world.\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodimma\u2019s administration has demonstrated a remarkable commitment to youth empowerment and technological advancement. Recognising the pivotal role of youth in driving economic growth and societal progress, the government has prioritised leveraging technology to combat unemployment and position Imo State as a leader in the digital economy.\n\nImo possesses a wealth of human capital, boasting a vibrant youth demographic, a robust educational infrastructure, and a deeply ingrained entrepreneurial spirit in the people both locally and outside the state. The SkillUpImo project, an ambitious undertaking aimed at equipping 300,000 Imolites with in-demand 4IR skills between 2022 and 2026, embodies this commitment. By fostering a digitally proficient workforce, SkillUpImo seeks to unlock the state\u2019s immense potential, transforming Imo into a global hub for IT talent and attracting significant tech-driven investments.\n\nHowever, the SkillUpImo project transcends a mere skills acquisition initiative; it represents a comprehensive strategy to create a digital workforce capable of competing on a global scale. As the world embraces the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the demand for digital skills is skyrocketing.\n\nBy 2030, a staggering 41 per cent of employers will downsise their workforce, with 39 per cent of job skills becoming obsolete. This underscores the urgent need for continuous upskilling and reskilling to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\n\nThe global digital skills gap poses a significant challenge, affecting both individuals and organisations worldwide. Approximately 87 per cent of organisations globally report talent shortages or anticipate facing them in the near future. Many positions, particularly in technology, remain unfilled due to a lack of qualified candidates.\n\nFurthermore, rapid technological advancements are rendering nearly 49 per cent of employees\u2019 current skills obsolete by the end of 2025. The technology sector is particularly impacted, with a severe shortage of professionals in emerging fields such as AI, data science, and cybersecurity.\n\nThe consequences of neglecting the digital skills gap are dire. By the end of 2025, the global economic output could suffer a staggering $2.5 trillion loss due to decreased productivity and stifled innovation. Over 54 per cent of employees globally require significant upskilling to meet the evolving demands of their job roles, emphasising the imperative for continuous learning and adaptation across industries.\n\nPrior to the Uzodimma administration, Imo State predominantly relied on industrial or manual labor, resulting in a relatively low supply of tech talent. This poses a significant economic risk as development expands and new industries emerge, creating a demand for hundreds of thousands of skilled workers.\n\nWithout the necessary tech know-how and digital literacy, Imo youths risk being left behind in the job market, leading to further unemployment and the influx of tech talent from outside the state.\n\nWith foresight and hindsight born out of pure visionary leadership, SkillUpImo was launched not only to upskill and reskill Imolites for local employment but also to prepare them for the global tech workforce. By equipping Imo\u2019s youth with in-demand digital skills, the project aims to position Imo as a go-to destination for tech talent and a hub of digital innovation.\n\nThis strategic move will not only benefit Imo\u2019s economy but also contribute to the global workforce by providing a pool of highly skilled and competitive individuals.\n\nSkillUpImo strategically focuses on critical 4IR domains such as software development, artificial intelligence, data science, cybersecurity, computer appreciation, and cloud computing, recognising these as the pillars of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the bedrock of modern economies.\n\nTo date, the programme has achieved significant milestones. With the successful completion of cohorts 1, 2 and cohort 3 currently underway, over 40,000 youths have received training in diverse areas encompassing cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, mobile app development, software development, blockchain, fintech, entrepreneurship, and digital marketing.\n\nNotably, the programme demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity, with 43 per cent male and 53 per cent female participation ,and 2 per cent participation from individuals with disabilities.\n\nSkillUpImo has forged strategic partnerships with global technology leaders, enhancing the programme\u2019s impact and global reach. Collaborations with Microsoft (Wootlab Foundation) and Cisco Networking Academy provide access to internationally recognised certifications, and enhance their employability prospects.\n\nFurthermore, the Memorandum of Understanding with the European Digital SME Alliance facilitates a mutually beneficial exchange, connecting Imo State talent with employment opportunities in Europe while simultaneously enriching the West African tech ecosystem.\n\nThe programme extends beyond classroom training, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of innovation. The establishment of dedicated innovation hubs and centers provides trainees with access to mentorship, advanced tools, and funding opportunities, empowering them to translate their skills into tangible solutions.\n\nThe ministry actively encourages innovation through the organisation of hackathons and tech-focused events, such as Hack4FUTO, which serve as platforms for collaboration, creativity, and the development of innovative solutions to real-world challenges. These initiatives have fostered a thriving entrepreneurial environment, with notable startups like Technamedia emerging as testaments to the programme\u2019s success in nurturing young talent.\n\nRecognising the importance of early exposure to technology, the Ministry of Digital Economy and e-Government extends its digital literacy programme to encompass younger learners. A specially curated curriculum, aligned with the SkillUpImo framework, is implemented during school holidays to introduce children in basic and elementary schools to fundamental digital concepts.\n\nDr Amadi is Imo State Commissioner for Digital Economy and E-Government.\n\nThis initiative, grounded in the principle of \u201ccatch them young,\u201d equips young minds with essential skills such as computer appreciation, introductory programming, and game development.\n\nBy fostering a digital literacy foundation at an early age, the programme aims to cultivate a generation of digitally adept individuals who are not only consumers of technology but also creators and innovators.\n\nBeing the first state in the federation to combat socio-economic issues like unemployment, amongst many other challenges faced before the current administration, Imo State has now emerged as a regional leader in workforce development, serving as a model for other states across Nigeria.\n\nHowever, the programme goes beyond technical skills development, also incorporating training in remote work and freelancing. This equips graduates with the ability to collaborate and deliver services for companies worldwide, fostering location independence and expanding their earning potential.\n\nThe Ministry\u2019s commitment to this vision is further exemplified by the launch of \u201cTechosphere,\u201d a dedicated freelance platform connecting SkillUpImo graduates with remote tech gigs.\n\nThe SkillUpImo Project has garnered widespread recognition for its innovative approach to equipping citizens with in-demand digital skills. This pioneering initiative has been lauded by stakeholders across the South-East region, culminating in the prestigious award for Best State MDA in ICT Human Capacity Development at the inaugural Nigeria Gov-Tech Public Service Awards.\n\nFurthermore, the strategic partnership with the European Digital SME Alliance positions Imo as a net exporter of skilled talent. SkillUpImo graduates, armed with in-demand skills, are contributing to the global tech landscape through remote work and on-site employment opportunities in Europe.\n\nThe success of the SkillUpImo Project aligns seamlessly with the Federal Government\u2019s National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS), which aims to achieve a $1 trillion digital economy by 2030. By prioritising skill development and fostering a digitally empowered workforce, Imo State is making a significant contribution to Nigeria\u2019s broader digital economy strategy.\n\nThe Ministry of Digital Economy and e-Government has actively cultivated public-private partnerships to drive this vision forward. Collaborations with leading technology companies such as Microsoft, Konga, Zinox, and local tech firms have provided SkillUpImo graduates with valuable employment opportunities and access to mentorship and resources.\n\nMoreover, Imo State is actively engaged in national and international tech forums, advocating for policies that support the growth of the digital economy. This proactive engagement ensures that Imo\u2019s voice is heard in shaping Nigeria\u2019s digital future and solidifies the state\u2019s position as a key contributor to the nation\u2019s technological advancement.\n\nThe digital revolution is reshaping the global landscape, and Imo State is at the forefront of this transformation. The SkillUpImo Project represents a visionary initiative that empowers citizens, fosters innovation, and positions Imo as a key player in the global digital economy. By harnessing the potential of its youthful population, Imo State is not only shaping its own future but also emerging as a leading source of talent and innovation for the world. The journey has just begun, and Imo State is poised to make its mark on the global stage in the years to come.\n\n"
