            "source": "AOL",
            "article_content": "SoundHound AI has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in the past year, rising a stunning 602% as of this writing on the back of the company's phenomenal growth, as well as a small investment by artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer Nvidia in this small but fast-growing voice AI solutions provider.\n\nSoundHound's terrific rise has brought its market capitalization to $4.7 billion as of this writing. However, the company has been prone to wild swings in its stock price in the past year. SoundHound stock is down 35% as of this writing in 2025 even in the absence of any company-specific information that could have caused such a steep sell-off.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nOne reason why investors may be hitting the sell button and booking profits in SoundHound stock is because of its extremely expensive valuation. The stock is currently trading at 58 times sales. That's richer than even Nvidia, a company that's much bigger and has been growing at a faster pace than SoundHound.\n\nThe rich valuation explains why SoundHound's 12-month median price target of $9 suggests that the stock could drop nearly 30% from current levels. So, investors looking to capitalize on the AI boom may consider looking elsewhere as SoundHound's valuation indicates that the stock may have gotten ahead of itself. This is where C3.ai (NYSE: AI) and DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN) come into play.\n\nBoth of these tech companies have been growing at a steady pace and are trading at reasonable valuations, and it won't be surprising to see them overtaking SoundHound's market cap in the coming year. Let's look at the reasons why.\n\n1. C3.ai\n\nC3.ai carries a 12-month consensus price target of $40, which would be a 30% jump from current levels. Assuming C3.ai hits that mark in the coming year, its market cap could jump to almost $5.2 billion from the current level of $3.99 billion. And if SoundHound AI stock drops as much as consensus estimates are projecting, there is a good chance that C3.ai will become a more valuable company in the span of a year.\n\nThe good part is that C3.ai's recent results demonstrate that it is indeed capable of delivering the upside that Wall Street is expecting from the company in the next year. The company's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on Oct. 31, 2024) increased 29% year over year to $94.3 million. That was a solid improvement over the 21% year-over-year revenue growth that C3.ai reported in the first quarter of the fiscal year.\n\nC3.ai also increased its full-year revenue guidance to a midpoint of $388 million from the previous estimate of $382.5 million. The updated guidance would translate into a 25% improvement over fiscal 2024 levels when the company's top line increased at a relatively slower pace of 16%. So, C3.ai's growth has accelerated nicely in the ongoing fiscal year, and that trend seems here to stay considering the huge addressable market opportunity the company is sitting on.\n\nMordor Intelligence estimates that the cloud AI services market could generate $89 billion in revenue this year. It is expected to clock a compound annual growth rate of 32% through 2030, generating $363 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period. C3.ai has set its sights on this opportunity through a wide portfolio of more than 100 enterprise AI applications that can be deployed in multiple industries ranging from oil and gas to manufacturing, to defense and intelligence, to retail, to government applications.\n\nMore importantly, it is offering these services through popular cloud computing platforms such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud. These channel partners are helping C3.ai drive strong growth in the number of agreements that it is signing with customers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, C3.ai closed 62% of its 58 agreements through the partner network. Google Cloud alone accounted for 20 of those agreements, a jump of 180% from the prior year.\n\nThis solid sales momentum through the partner network is here to stay as C3.ai has been tightening its relationship with the likes of Microsoft, which should allow it to reach a wider customer base and tap the massive opportunity present in the cloud AI market.\n\nFinally, C3.ai is trading at a sales multiple of 11, much more affordable than SoundHound AI. Moreover, C3.ai's improving growth profile means that it can justify its valuation, suggesting that the stock can indeed head higher in the coming year and overtake SoundHound's market cap.\n\n2. DigitalOcean\n\nDigitalOcean is another company that's on track to capitalize on the growing adoption of cloud-based AI services. The company provides an on-demand cloud infrastructure platform that customers can rent to build, deploy, and scale applications. DigitalOcean is now offering cloud infrastructure services powered by graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia to customers so that they can train AI models, generate images, and render videos in the cloud without having to incur any hardware costs.\n\nThese moves could pave the way for stronger growth at DigitalOcean as its AI-focused offerings could encourage customers to spend more money. The good part is that DigitalOcean is already winning a bigger share of its customers' wallets. The company's average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 11% year over year in the third quarter of 2024 to $102.51.\n\nThe increase in the ARPU explains why DigitalOcean's earnings increased at a faster pace of 18% year over year to $0.52 per share as compared to the 12% jump in its revenue. The company's 2024 guidance of $776 million points toward a 12% increase in its top line from 2023. Analysts are expecting an acceleration in DigitalOcean's growth in 2025 and 2026.\n\nDOCN Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nDOCN Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\n\nHowever, don't be surprised to see the company delivering stronger growth in both 2025 and 2026. It is worth noting that DigitalOcean's 2024 revenue guidance has increased from its original forecast of $765 million issued in February last year. With the addition of AI-specific offerings into its portfolio, DigitalOcean may be able to capture a bigger share of its addressable market, which it expects to hit $213 billion in 2027, and clock stronger-than-expected growth.\n\nAs such, buying DigitalOcean stock right now looks like a good idea as it is trading at just 4.4 times sales and 18 times forward earnings. Moreover, analysts are expecting the stock to hit a median price target of $40 in the next year, which would be a 19% jump from current levels. DigitalOcean is capable of achieving that target in the coming year or even beating it.\n\nIf that's indeed the case and DigitalOcean jumps 19% in the next year, its market cap could jump to $3.7 billion, which would be enough to help it overtake SoundHound if the latter's stock price drops as much as analysts are anticipating.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in DigitalOcean right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in DigitalOcean, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and DigitalOcean wasn\u2019t one of them.

We have REM pods that basically do the same thing, but they stay in a stationary area and they will make a lot of noise,\u201d said Covey. \u201cWe have cat balls that, you know, you wouldn\u2019t think would be anything, but they will just be sitting in there on something solid and they will start to light up.\u201d\n\nAlthough the house is simply a museum by day, even those familiar with the home have experienced unexplained happenings.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been times when I\u2019ve been in this house by myself and heard footsteps and nobody\u2019s been in the house, so yeah, I think that there\u2019s something going on, but I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s malicious in any way,\u201d said Carol Jackson, President of the Board of Trustees over the Campbell-Flannagan-Murrell House Museum.\n\nThis event is part of an ongoing effort for more paranormal tourism in Appalachia, bringing attention to smaller communities that are rich with folklore and paranormal history.\n\n\u201cSouthern West Virginia is absolutely overflowing with the haunted stories, the paranormal, there is an energy here like no other and there is a history here like no other,\u201d explained Pamela Huff, a member of Appalachian Ghost Tours.\n\nFor more information on the museum, you can view their website or Facebook page, and to keep up to date with Appalachian Ghost Tours, click here.\n\nCopyright 2025 WVVA.

Does his restless spirit still wander beneath the trees there? Why are there so many paranormal reports in that small area of Bedford? And who is the shadowy figure often reported along side the spectre of Black Tom?\n\nWe also look at other myths and legends attached to highwaymen with connections to Bedfordshire including Biggleswade and beyond.

            "article_content": "In a groundbreaking discovery that sounds like science fiction but is absolutely real, researchers have found that your eyes contain hidden signals that could predict your risk of having a stroke. This revolutionary finding isn\u2019t just another medical study, it\u2019s a potential game-changer in how we approach stroke prevention and early detection.\n\nThe incredible science behind retinal fingerprints\n\nScientists have identified 29 unique vascular indicators in your retina that serve as warning signs for stroke risk. These tiny blood vessels in your eyes create patterns as unique as your fingerprints, and their condition can reveal crucial information about your overall health. Within these indicators, 17 are density-related markers that can increase your stroke risk by up to 19% when altered. These changes are like tiny red flags waving in your eyes, signaling potential danger before other symptoms appear. The remaining indicators focus on the size and twistedness of blood vessels, with changes potentially raising stroke risk by nearly 20%. Think of these vessels as tiny roads in your eyes, their condition reflecting the health of your entire cardiovascular system.\n\nWhy this discovery is absolutely mind-blowing\n\nTraditional stroke risk assessments often involve invasive procedures and expensive tests. But this new method requires nothing more than a specialized photograph of your eye. The implications are enormous, especially for communities where access to advanced medical testing is limited or cost-prohibitive.\n\nThe beauty of this breakthrough lies in its simplicity. During a routine eye exam, doctors can capture detailed images of your retina and analyze them for these crucial indicators. It\u2019s painless, quick, and could potentially save countless lives through early detection.\n\nThe fascinating connection between your eyes and brain\n\nYour retina isn\u2019t just a window to your soul, it\u2019s actually an extension of your brain. Every tiny blood vessel in your eye tells a story about the health of your brain\u2019s blood vessels. This connection explains why changes in your retinal vasculature can predict stroke risk with remarkable accuracy.\n\nWhat makes this discovery revolutionary\n\nThe research team analyzed data from over 45,000 participants. This massive study revealed that retinal analysis combined with basic demographic information could predict stroke risk as accurately as traditional methods.\n\nWhat\u2019s truly remarkable is how this technology could transform preventive healthcare. Imagine walking into your local eye clinic and getting a comprehensive stroke risk assessment during your regular eye exam. This isn\u2019t just convenient, it\u2019s revolutionary for global health care accessibility.\n\nThe global impact of this breakthrough\n\nThis discovery could dramatically change how we approach stroke prevention worldwide. In regions where advanced medical facilities are scarce, a simple eye scan could become a lifesaving tool. The technology could help identify at-risk individuals years before they might experience a stroke, allowing for early intervention and prevention strategies.\n\nHealthcare providers are particularly excited about implementing this technology in primary care settings. It could become as routine as checking blood pressure, but with the potential to reveal much more detailed information about cardiovascular health.\n\nWhat this means for the future of healthcare\n\nThe implications extend far beyond stroke prediction. Researchers believe similar retinal analysis could help predict other conditions like heart disease and dementia. This opens up endless possibilities for early detection and prevention of various diseases through simple eye examinations.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, we might see artificial intelligence systems analyzing these retinal images in real-time, providing instant risk assessments and recommendations. This could revolutionize how we approach preventive healthcare, making it more accessible and effective than ever before.\n\nThe discovery of retinal vascular fingerprints as predictors of stroke risk isn\u2019t just a scientific breakthrough, it\u2019s a glimpse into the future of medicine. It shows us that sometimes the most powerful diagnostic tools are hidden in plain sight, waiting to be understood and utilized. As this technology develops and becomes more widely available, it could transform how we approach disease prevention and ultimately save countless lives through early detection and intervention."

Recent discoveries have revealed ancient crust hidden deep within the mantle. This \"sunken world\" challenges our understanding of the planet's dynamic processes. What lies beneath could redefine geological history.\n\nNew Method Unveils Hidden Mantle Anomalies\n\nScientists have identified unexpected sections of Earth's crust deep inside the mantle. Using advanced seismographic imaging, researchers mapped these anomalies in unprecedented detail. The study, published in Scientific Reports, highlights unknown structures under areas with no tectonic activity.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nOne key discovery was beneath Easter Island, where sunken crust sections were detected. Researchers believe these anomalies could be remnants of the mantle's creation. Alternatively, they might contain dense material formed over millions of years.\n\nRead More: 'Moon at risk of huge damage': Earth's natural satellite added to endangered heritage list; here's why\n\nDoctoral candidate Thomas Schouten from ETH Zurich said, \"With the high-resolution model, we see anomalies everywhere. But their true nature is still unclear.\"\n\nRevolutionary Techniques Offer Clearer Insight\n\nUnlike traditional methods using isolated earthquake data, this research combines global seismographs into a cohesive model. Full-waveform inversion, the technique used, required the Piz Daint supercomputer in Switzerland to process vast datasets.\n\nCo-author Thue Fichtner likened the discovery to medical imaging breakthroughs. \"It\u2019s like finding a new artery in an unexpected location,\" Fichtner said.\n\nDespite similarities to known subducted slabs, the anomalies raise new questions. Further research will delve into their composition and origins. Scientists hope these findings will unlock deeper insights into Earth\u2019s evolving structure."

            "article_content": "Revelations that OpenAI secretly funded and had access to the FrontierMath benchmarking dataset are raising concerns about whether it was used to train its reasoning o3 AI reasoning model, and the validity of the model\u2019s high scores.\n\nIn addition to accessing the benchmarking dataset, OpenAI funded its creation, a fact that was withheld from the mathematicians who contributed to developing FrontierMath. Epoch AI belatedly disclosed OpenAI\u2019s funding only in the final paper published on Arxiv.org, which announced the benchmark. Earlier versions of the paper omitted any mention of OpenAI\u2019s involvement.\n\nScreenshot Of FrontierMath Paper\n\nCloseup Of Acknowledgement\n\nPrevious Version Of Paper That Lacked Acknowledgement\n\nOpenAI 03 Model Scored Highly On FrontierMath Benchmark\n\nThe news of OpenAI\u2019s secret involvement are raising questions about the high scores achieved by the o3 reasoning AI model and causing disappointment with the FrontierMath project. Epoch AI responded with transparency about what happened and what they\u2019re doing to check if the o3 model was trained with the FrontierMath dataset.\n\nGiving OpenAI access to the dataset was unexpected because the whole point of it is to test AI models but that can\u2019t be done if the models know the questions and answers beforehand.\n\nA post in the r/singularity subreddit expressed this disappointment and cited a document that claimed that the mathematicians didn\u2019t know about OpenAI\u2019s involvement:\n\n\u201cFrontier Math, the recent cutting-edge math benchmark, is funded by OpenAI. OpenAI allegedly has access to the problems and solutions. This is disappointing because the benchmark was sold to the public as a means to evaluate frontier models, with support from renowned mathematicians. In reality, Epoch AI is building datasets for OpenAI. They never disclosed any ties with OpenAI before.\u201d\n\nThe Reddit discussion cited a publication that revealed OpenAI\u2019s deeper involvement:\n\n\u201cThe mathematicians creating the problems for FrontierMath were not (actively)[2] communicated to about funding from OpenAI. \u2026Now Epoch AI or OpenAI don\u2019t say publicly that OpenAI has access to the exercises or answers or solutions. I have heard second-hand that OpenAI does have access to exercises and answers and that they use them for validation.\u201d\n\nTamay Besiroglu (LinkedIn Profile), associated director at Epoch AI, acknowledged that OpenAI had access to the datasets but also asserted that there was a \u201choldout\u201d dataset that OpenAI didn\u2019t have access to.\n\nHe wrote in the cited document:\n\n\u201cTamay from Epoch AI here. We made a mistake in not being more transparent about OpenAI\u2019s involvement. We were restricted from disclosing the partnership until around the time o3 launched, and in hindsight we should have negotiated harder for the ability to be transparent to the benchmark contributors as soon as possible. Our contract specifically prevented us from disclosing information about the funding source and the fact that OpenAI has data access to much but not all of the dataset. We own this error and are committed to doing better in the future. Regarding training usage: We acknowledge that OpenAI does have access to a large fraction of FrontierMath problems and solutions, with the exception of a unseen-by-OpenAI hold-out set that enables us to independently verify model capabilities. However, we have a verbal agreement that these materials will not be used in model training. OpenAI has also been fully supportive of our decision to maintain a separate, unseen holdout set\u2014an extra safeguard to prevent overfitting and ensure accurate progress measurement. From day one, FrontierMath was conceived and presented as an evaluation tool, and we believe these arrangements reflect that purpose. \u201c\n\nMore Facts About OpenAI & FrontierMath Revealed\n\nElliot Glazer (LinkedIn profile/Reddit profile), the lead mathematician at Epoch AI confirmed that OpenAI has the dataset and that they were allowed to use it to evaluate OpenAI\u2019s o3 large language model, which is their next state of the art AI that\u2019s referred to as a reasoning AI model. He offered his opinion that the high scores obtained by the o3 model are \u201clegit\u201d and that Epoch AI is conducting an independent evaluation to determine whether or not o3 had access to the FrontierMath dataset for training, which could cast the model\u2019s high scores in a different light.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\u201cEpoch\u2019s lead mathematician here. Yes, OAI funded this and has the dataset, which allowed them to evaluate o3 in-house. We haven\u2019t yet independently verified their 25% claim. To do so, we\u2019re currently developing a hold-out dataset and will be able to test their model without them having any prior exposure to these problems. My personal opinion is that OAI\u2019s score is legit (i.e., they didn\u2019t train on the dataset), and that they have no incentive to lie about internal benchmarking performances. However, we can\u2019t vouch for them until our independent evaluation is complete.\u201d\n\nGlazer had also shared that Epoch AI was going to test o3 using a \u201choldout\u201d dataset that OpenAI didn\u2019t have access to, saying:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to evaluate o3 with OAI having zero prior exposure to the holdout problems. This will be airtight.\u201d\n\nAnother post on Reddit by Glazer described how the \u201choldout set\u201d was created:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll describe the process more clearly when the holdout set eval is actually done, but we\u2019re choosing the holdout problems at random from a larger set which will be added to FrontierMath. The production process is otherwise identical to how it\u2019s always been.\u201d\n\nWaiting For Answers\n\nThat\u2019s where the drama stands until the Epoch AI evaluation is completed which will indicate whether or not OpenAI had trained their AI reasoning model with the dataset or only used it for benchmarking it.\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/Antonello Marangi"

OpenAI recently introduced the Tasks feature, allowing users to schedule and execute tasks, with plans for broader availability soon.\n\nChatGPT-maker OpenAI could soon introduce its first-ever AI agent with super-intelligence, the report stated. This follows rumors that CEO Sam Altman has arranged a meeting with US government representatives on January 30 to demonstrate the AI agent\u2019s capabilities. Additionally, according to the report, the new AI agent, named Operator, will be made available in the first half of 2025.\n\nThis AI agent will require very little human intervention to complete complex tasks. The report added that it will be capable of making choices, adjusting and responding to various circumstances, analyzing bigger data sets, and providing accurate responses.\n\nCEO Sam Altman is also expected to discuss AI growth and impact at the meeting. According to reports, Altman is currently in Washington attending Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States and could discuss the implementation of AI software systems for the enhancement of the US economy.\n\nAlso read: ChatGPT Search is rolling out to all users for free: Here\u2019s what you need to know\n\nHowever, the company has not yet confirmed the release of the AI super agent. OpenAI has been discussing the super agent and details for a while now stating that the AI agent may be capable of performing a wide range of tasks, including writing code, booking a flight, researching a topic, and performing any other complex task that requires multiple actions.\n\nOn the other hand, companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have introduced AI agents that are capable of performing specific tasks within certain limitations. OpenAI\u2019s forthcoming AI agent can offer more than these offerings, the report added.\n\nPreviously, the company introduced a new feature called Tasks which allows users to schedule and execute tasks in the future. It also helps in setting reminders turning the chatbot into a personal assistant. This feature is currently in beta for Plus, Pro, and Team users and can be used for one-time or recurring tasks like reminders, daily briefings, and workouts. It will be introduced to the users in the coming weeks."

            "article_content": "WhatsApp, with its billions of users worldwide, has become a major target for scammers seeking to exploit its popularity. Understanding the various types of scams and learning how to avoid them is essential to protect yourself and your personal information.\n\nHow to Stay Safe on WhatsApp\n\nTo protect yourself from WhatsApp scams, it\u2019s crucial to adopt a healthy level of skepticism. Be cautious when interacting with unknown contacts, especially if they are requesting money or personal information. Avoid clicking on unsolicited links, scanning random QR codes, or downloading suspicious files. Always verify the identity of anyone who contacts you unexpectedly, and enable two-step verification on your WhatsApp account for extra security.\n\nThis article will explore some of the most common WhatsApp scams and provide tips on how to stay safe from these fraudulent schemes.\n\n1. Fake Donation Schemes\n\nIn this scam, fraudsters pose as charitable organizations or individuals in need of donations for personal or community causes. Once you send the money, the \u201ccharity\u201d disappears, and the scammer pockets the funds.\n\nAlways verify the legitimacy of charitable organizations before making donations. Reputable charities don\u2019t rely on random messages through WhatsApp to solicit donations. If you\u2019re inclined to donate, go through official websites or established fundraising platforms.\n\n2. Two-Step Verification Scams\n\nSome scammers may message you, claiming they mistakenly sent their two-step verification code to your phone number and ask you to forward it to them. This is an attempt to hijack your WhatsApp account by tricking you into providing the code they need to gain access.\n\nIf you receive such a message, do not share the verification code. Instead, secure your account by enabling two-step verification within WhatsApp settings and regularly updating your PIN. This adds an extra layer of protection to your account, making it harder for scammers to take control.\n\n3. Romance/Catfishing and Prostitution Scams\n\nSome scammers take advantage of people looking for relationships by pretending to be interested in romance. Over time, they build trust before inventing a crisis and asking for financial help. Similarly, you may be approached by someone offering illicit services, which is often just a way to get you to click on phishing or malware links.\n\nTo avoid falling for romance scams, be skeptical of people you meet online, especially if they avoid meeting in person or making video calls. Check their social media presence, and use tools like reverse image search to verify their photos. If someone asks for money early in the relationship, it\u2019s likely a scam.\n\n4. Fake Family or Friend Emergency\n\nIn this scam, someone poses as a friend or family member, claiming to be messaging from a new phone number due to an emergency. The scammer engages in conversation before eventually asking for money or personal information. These tactics often exploit the urgency of the situation to trick people into acting without verifying the identity of the sender.\n\nTo prevent falling for this scam, ask the individual for specific details that only the real person would know, such as their old phone number or personal details not readily available online. If the person cannot provide this information, it\u2019s likely a scam. Always double-check before sending any money or sharing sensitive information, and contact the real person through other methods if you have doubts.\n\n5. Free Gift Cards or Vouchers\n\nA common scam that continues to circulate on WhatsApp involves messages claiming that you\u2019ve won a free gift card or voucher, often from major retailers. These messages usually contain links that direct you to phishing sites or download malware onto your device.\n\nThe easiest way to avoid this scam is to remember that reputable companies do not give out free gift cards or vouchers through random messages. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Always verify the legitimacy of any offer by visiting the company\u2019s official website directly rather than clicking on any suspicious links.\n\n6. Fake Tech Support or Account Verification\n\nIn this scam, someone pretends to be from WhatsApp or another tech company, asking you to verify your account details or provide sensitive information. They might direct you to a phishing website or attempt to hijack your account.\n\nTo avoid this, remember that WhatsApp will never contact you directly through the app to ask for verification details. If you need to verify your account, this process will typically happen through a phone call or SMS. Never provide personal information or passwords through in-app messages.\n\n7. WhatsApp Gold Scam\n\nOne of the oldest WhatsApp scams is the \u201cWhatsApp Gold\u201d hoax, where users receive an unsolicited message offering a supposed upgraded version of WhatsApp with exclusive features. The message includes a link to download this non-existent app, which often leads to phishing attempts or malware downloads.\n\nTo avoid falling victim to this scam, always be skeptical of unsolicited messages offering upgrades or special versions of apps. Official app updates come directly from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, so ensure that any downloads are from these legitimate sources. If the message contains a URL that doesn\u2019t look like it comes from an official app store or WhatsApp website, it\u2019s best to avoid it altogether.\n\n8. Fake Lotteries and Giveaways\n\nAnother scam involves messages claiming you\u2019ve won a lottery or giveaway. To claim the prize, you\u2019re instructed to click on a link or provide personal information. These scams usually result in phishing attacks or malware.\n\nLegitimate companies do not notify winners of contests or lotteries via WhatsApp. If you receive such a message, do not engage with it. Instead, research the company or promotion to verify whether it\u2019s real before taking any action.\n\n9. Cryptocurrency and Investment Scams\n\nWith the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, scammers often prey on people\u2019s desire to invest and make quick profits. Scammers might message you, promising large returns for a small investment or offering secret investment tips in exchange for money.\n\nBefore making any investments, always do thorough research. Avoid deals that seem too good to be true, and only invest through reputable platforms. Remember, high returns always come with high risks, and legitimate investments require careful consideration, not spontaneous decisions made over WhatsApp.\n\n10. Unsolicited QR Codes\n\nSome scammers send codes instead of links, asking you to scan the code for many reasons. When you scan these codes, they take you to fake websites or put your phone at risk for malware or scams.\n\nTo stay safe, do not scan codes sent from people you do not know. In apps like WhatsApp, there is no good reason for someone to send you a code instead of a link unless they want to hide something. Real codes are on boxes, screens, or known sites, not in messages from unknown people.\n\nBy staying alert and using these tips, you can lower the risk of falling for scams and keep your info safe.\n\nDisclaimer: We may be compensated by some of the companies whose products we talk about, but our articles and reviews are always our honest opinions.

            "article_content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an incredible technology, and we've only scratched the surface of its potential. Currently, it's being used as a program on the side of normal work, but it's about to enter a new phase: Agentic AI. Agentic AI, often called AI agents, involves setting up software programs to do tasks that humans normally do. This next phase in implementing AI is critical, as it will allow those at the cutting edge to do more with fewer resources.\n\nOne of the leaders in agentic AI is Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). The software company is making a heavy push to promote and integrate agentic AI, and it also has one of the best platforms for implementing it.\n\nSalesforce's platform is ripe for agentic AI integration\n\nSalesforce makes customer relationship management (CRM) software. CRM is an incredibly broad sector but can generally be summarized as a business interaction with a potential customer from the marketing stage to after-sale support. There's a lot that happens between those two points, and Salesforce software is there to offer support along the way.\n\nMany customer interactions can be automated by AI agents, which is why agentic AI is such a massive trend for Salesforce. As with most software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, the more add-ons you have from the base software package, the more expensive it gets. This unlocks another milestone for the generative AI trend; we're reaching a point where many companies are starting to monetize their AI investments.\n\nSalesforce's CEO and co-founder, Marc Benioff, is extremely bullish on agentic AI. During the company's 2024 Dreamforce conference, he stated, \"This is what AI was meant to be.\" That's a big statement, but the ability for companies to become more efficient and free their workers up to do tasks that require original thinking will be a huge change for many in the workforce.\n\nHowever, does this one technology have the ability to drive Salesforce's stock to new heights?\n\nSalesforce needs this new technology to kick-start growth again\n\nSalesforce is a mature software company that started to shift from growth-at-all-costs to maximizing profitability a few years ago. However, its sales growth has been a bit slow, by most software company standards, over the past few quarters. In its fiscal 2025's third quarter (ended Oct. 31), revenue was up 8% year over year to $9.44 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) were $1.60 versus $1.26 a year ago -- a 27% gain.\n\nEPS growth outpaced revenue growth because of Salesforce's rising margins. During last year's third quarter, Salesforce posted operating margins of 17.8%. This year, it delivered 20.6% operating margins. This will be a key trend to watch, as some of the most profitable software companies can reach profit margins of up to 30%. It will likely be some time before Salesforce can reach that level (if it can), but shareholders will be elated if it does.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is concerned about collaborations between large cloud providers and leading developers of generative artificial intelligence (AI). It is particularly concerned about Microsoft's investment of USD 13 billion in OpenAI and the collaboration between Google and Anthropic. The latter two are actually competing with each other with their Gemini and Claude models, but are also strategic partners. In these cases, the FTC sees an increased risk that the younger AI companies could be completely bought up or otherwise taken over by the technology giants in the near future. The authority is also skeptical about the billion-euro investment by cloud market leader Amazon in Anthropic.\n\nAnzeige\n\nThe relevant report published by the antitrust watchdog on Friday \"sheds light on the question of how partnerships between large technology companies lead to lock-ins\", explained FTC boss Lina Khan. Such collaborations could deprive other start-ups of important AI research results, which could undermine competition. More and more companies are relying on generative AI, Khan explained. Regulators and policy makers must therefore remain vigilant to ward off business strategies \"that undermine open markets, opportunities and innovation\".\n\nThe authors of the report shed light on aspects of the structure of partnerships between cloud providers and AI developers. For example, they look at the equity and revenue-sharing rights as well as certain advisory, control and exclusivity rights that Microsoft & Co. receive as part of their financing. The competition watchdogs are also concerned about obligations that require OpenAI and Anthropic to spend a large proportion of their partner's investments on their cloud services. The deals also include access to \"large amounts of computer resources at reduced prices\", intellectual property rights relating to the latest AI models and certain financial and training data. In addition, there would be opportunities to expand current products \u2013 such as the integration of AI applications into cloud offerings or other solutions.\n\nEU antitrust watchdogs also have questions\n\nFurthermore, the FTC is critical of the ability of collaborations to influence access to computer resources and highly skilled workers in a way that could massively impair competition. It also criticizes the potential of the deals to increase contractual and technical switching costs for AI developer partners. This would make it more difficult for OpenAI and Anthropic to find other cloud service providers. It remains to be seen what the new leadership of the FTC under the second Trump administration, which takes office next week, will do with the results.\n\nFormer EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in the summer that Microsoft's investment in OpenAI was not yet a case for a review under merger control rules. However, she said that both companies would be asked questions under antitrust rules \"to understand whether certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative impact on competitors\". The EU executive also wants to scrutinize the impact of the agreement between Google and Samsung to pre-install Gemini Nano on certain Samsung devices. There is a risk that tech giants could make it difficult for smaller developers of AI models to \"reach end users\".\n\n(axv)"

            "article_content": "\u2018Funny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to Democrats,\u2019 says one tech titan.\n\nTwo Democratic senators are accusing tech giants of trying to \u201cinfluence and sway the actions and policies of the incoming administration\u201d by donating millions of dollars to President Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. In response, some of those tech titans are remarking that they never got similarly stern letters when they donated to Democrats in the past.\n\nSenator Warren and Senator Bennet, two members of the tax-writing Finance Committee, first raised their concerns about the donations in a letter to OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, a longtime Democratic donor who this year personally gave $1 million of his own money to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund.\n\n\u201cBig Tech companies have come under increased scrutiny from federal regulators for antitrust violations, violations of privacy, and harms to workers, consumers, and competition,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cWe are concerned that your company and other Big Tech donors are using your massive contributions to the inaugural fund to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration in an effort to avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to democrats,\u201d Mr. Altman wrote on X in response to the letter.\n\nMr. Altman is just one Silicon Valley titan who is personally giving money to the inauguration fund. The chief executive of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, and the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook, have also given $1 million of their own money to support Monday\u2019s inaugural activities.\n\nCompanies, too, are showering Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing-in celebrations with cash. Amazon is giving $1 million after donating just over $50,000 to Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration, and just over $250,000 to President Biden\u2019s inauguration ceremony. Google \u2014 which donated $285,000 to the 2017 inauguration and just over $337,000 to the 2021 inauguration \u2014 is giving $1 million to Trump this time around. Microsoft gave $500,000 to both Trump\u2019s first inauguration and Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration, though they have given $1 million to the 2025 inauguration fund.\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has already given $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund via his company, after not giving a penny to any past inauguration funds. Some of Trump\u2019s closest allies and supporters don\u2019t necessarily see these tech leaders as true converts to the movement, but rather businessmen who are just trying to survive in Trump\u2019s political landscape.\n\nThe president-elect\u2019s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, compared men like Messrs. Altman and Zuckerberg to military leaders who have issued full surrenders. \u201cI look at this, and I think most people at our movement look at this, as: President Trump broke the oligarchs. He broke them, and they surrendered,\u201d Mr. Bannon told ABC News on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI view this as September of 1945 on the [USS] Missouri. You have the Imperial high command, and [Trump] is like Douglass MacArthur,\u201d Mr. Bannon added, comparing tech giants to the defeated Japanese Empire.\n\nIn their letter, Ms. Warren and Mr. Bennet asked Mr. Altman to provide answers to a number of questions aimed not only at him, but at all the tech leaders who are suddenly coming around to the Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that federal regulators continue to evenhandedly apply competition, consumer protection, anti-discrimination laws and any other rule or law that applies to your company, But the industry\u2019s efforts suggest that Big Tech companies are trying to curry favor and skirt the rules,\u201d the senators write."

            "article_content": "A tech professional recently shared valuable insights on social media about navigating layoffs after being let go by a prominent tech company. Reflecting on his experience, he emphasized the importance of financial preparedness , skill enhancement, and leveraging professional networks. Building an emergency fund with 6\u201312 months of living expenses provided him the flexibility to focus on finding the right opportunity. He also credited certifications in AI and machine learning, such as Google Cloud ML Engineer and Microsoft Azure AI Engineer, for helping his resume stand out and accelerating interview calls. Networking proved critical, with referrals from ex-colleagues, mentors, and LinkedIn posts opening new doors. He also recommended exploring roles in non-tech industries like finance and healthcare, which are increasingly hiring for AI and automation projects. Freelancing, he noted, was another avenue to maintain skills, expand networks, and gain experience while job hunting.In a similar situation, another techie sought advice online after being laid off in September. Having returned to India after working abroad and boasting nine years of experience in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and data, he faced challenges in the local job market, including rejections or significantly lower salary offers. The lack of preparation in competitive coding practices like DSA and Leetcode further added to his struggles. The tech professional expressed frustration and embarrassment after three months without an offer.Online responses suggested exploring opportunities abroad, especially in regions like the Middle East, where AI and tech roles are in demand. Others advised accepting lower-paying offers temporarily while continuing to search for better roles. Some users expressed surprise at the challenges faced by AI and ML professionals, questioning whether the demand in these fields was dwindling or if entry into data science had become increasingly competitive."

The Japanese automaker unveiled the e-Vitara and e-Access at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025. Toshihiro Suzuki, Representative Director and President, Suzuki Motor Corporation addressed the media gathering and shared the company's roadmap and product strategy.\n\n\n\nTarget 50% Market Share: Toshihiro Suzuki emphasises on the brand's target of regaining the market share with newer SUV models. \"Our priority is to regain the 50 per cent market share. We are committed to bringing in new products to excite the market, actively increasing our portfolio with special emphasis on SUVs\"\n\n\n\nMaruti Suzuki's market share has sharply dropped in the last few years. The Japanese automaker held 41% market share in 2024, down from 52% in 2024.\n\n\n\nBy 2030, the company expects to approach customers with a multi-fuel strategy with a sizable mix of gasoline, CNG, EVs and hybrids. Suzuki hopes the small car demand will revive, calling it a 'bread-and-butter' segment. Production and Exports: The automaker aims to manufacture 4 million units annually and its upcoming plant in Kharkhoda, Haryana is likely to contribute 1 million units once operational. Suzuki said India's production expertise and economy of scale will be pivotal in exporting products and making 'India a global EV export hub'.\n\n\n\nThe company exported 3.26 lakh units in 2024, registering an annual growth of 121 per cent. Suzuki said the company is exporting 'Made-in-India' Fronx to over 70 countries. The e-Vitara will also be exported to Japan, Europe and other markets from India, Suzuki added. Suzuki At The Expo 2025: Maruti Suzuki unveiled the e Vitara at the Expo, which will be available in two battery pack options: 49 kWh and 61 kWh. The e Vitara is a grounds-up electric vehicle and will be exported to several global markets. Its India launch is expected later this year. The company also showcased the Fronx Turbo Concept, Grand Vitara Adventure Concept, Jimny Conqueror Concept, Swift Champion Concept and Brezza Powerplay Concept. Suzuki Motorcycles launched the new Access 125 at the Expo, alongside the unveiling of e-Access.\n\n"

            "article_content": "The quantum computing revolution is changing technology as we know it. Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations far beyond the capabilities of traditional computers.\n\nThis transformative technology has the potential to revolutionize diverse sectors, including medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence (AI). Underscoring this point, a recent McKinsey & Co. research report projects that quantum computing could generate a whopping $1.3 trillion in economic value by 2035.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nA swirling, colorful, abstract image representing the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nJust as the internet boom created giants like Amazon and Google, quantum computing could give rise to a new generation of industry-leading companies, offering early investors the potential for extraordinary gains. Imagine a future with personalized medicines, revolutionary materials, and supercharged AI -- all made possible by quantum computing.\n\nLet's take a closer look at two quantum computing stocks that could represent once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for early shareholders.\n\nTrapped-ion quantum computing leader\n\nIonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is emerging as a potential leader in the commercialization of quantum computing through its trapped-ion technology approach. Unlike traditional superconducting quantum competitors, IonQ's architecture operates at room temperature and demonstrates strong qubit connectivity, with the company's Forte system delivering 36 algorithmic qubits at 99.9% fidelity -- marking significant performance advantages that could translate into a formidable competitive moat as the technology matures.\n\nWhile some quantum computing companies focus on the number of physical qubits, IonQ uses \"algorithmic qubits\" to represent the computational power available after accounting for error correction and other factors that affect algorithm performance. This metric aims to provide a more practical measure of a quantum computer's ability to solve real-world problems.\n\nBeyond the core technology, IonQ's execution has been notable. The company has consistently beaten aggressive roadmap timelines, secured a major $54.5M Air Force Research Lab contract, and established partnerships with heavyweights like pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and engineering simulation software leader Ansys.\n\nWhile quantum computing stocks are notoriously speculative, IonQ's manufacturing facility opening and modular multicore architecture as a potential path to scaling suggest the company has a credible shot at capturing a meaningful share of the vast and potentially unparalleled quantum computing market.\n\nSuperconducting quantum pioneer\n\nRigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) takes a distinctive approach to quantum computing, focusing on superconducting technology and vertical integration. Unlike room-temperature trapped-ion systems, Rigetti's architecture leverages established semiconductor manufacturing processes at the company's dedicated Fab-1 quantum foundry, potentially offering advantages in scaling and gate speeds in the years ahead.\n\nWhile qubit count is one progress metric, Rigetti emphasizes gate fidelity as a key performance metric. The company's latest Ankaa-3 system achieves 99% median iSWAP gate fidelity and 99.5% median fidelity for fSim gates -- critical benchmarks that reflect the system's ability to perform reliable quantum operations with minimal errors, which is necessary for practical applications.\n\nBeyond the technical foundations, Rigetti's execution showcases strategic positioning. The company has secured its role as the quantum hardware provider for the U.K.'s National Quantum Computing Centre, established partnerships with financial leaders like HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, and maintains strong ties with the Air Force Research Lab and Fermilab's SQMS Center.\n\nWhile quantum computing remains an emerging field with significant technological hurdles, including maintaining qubit coherence, Rigetti's full-stack approach and innovative multichip architecture, combined with flexible deployment options through major cloud platforms and the QCS Direct cloud service, suggest the company is well positioned to compete in the evolving quantum computing landscape.\n\nA quantum computing revolution\n\nAs quantum computing advances from research labs toward commercial reality, IonQ and Rigetti demonstrate the potential technological paths that could make quantum computing a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity. Each company combines innovative architectures with strategic partnerships and clear commercialization strategies that could provide paths to capturing market share.\n\nWhile the technology remains highly speculative and faces significant technical hurdles, companies that successfully scale their systems while maintaining high performance could deliver unprecedented returns. As these potential quantum leaders emerge, investors must monitor technical progress, partnership momentum, and execution against stated roadmaps.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and IonQ wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $843,960!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The Space Age Restaurant\u2019s exterior is a retro-futuristic feast for the eyes, complete with porthole windows and a sign that screams \u201cThe Jetsons were here!\u201d Photo Credit: Ellen M.\n\nEver had one of those days when you\u2019re cruising down the highway, stomach grumbling, and you think to yourself, \u201cGee, I could really go for some cosmic cuisine right about now\u201d?\n\nWell, buckle up, space cadets, because I\u2019ve got just the place for you.\n\nThe Space Age Restaurant isn\u2019t just a pit stop; it\u2019s a full-blown extraterrestrial experience that\u2019ll have you questioning whether you\u2019ve accidentally stumbled onto the set of a B-movie sci-fi flick.\n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking.\n\n\u201cAnother themed restaurant? Haven\u2019t we seen it all before?\u201d\n\nStep inside and prepare for liftoff! The interior of Space Age Restaurant is a cosmic collision of diner charm and space-race chic. Houston, we have a hunger situation! Photo Credit: Patricia Hayes\n\nBut trust me, this place is about as far from ordinary as Pluto is from the sun (and yes, I\u2019m still counting Pluto as a planet, fight me).\n\nAs you approach the Space Age Restaurant, the first thing you\u2019ll notice is its unmistakable retro-futuristic exterior.\n\nThe building looks like it was plucked straight out of a 1950s comic book about what diners would look like in the year 2000.\n\nWith its sleek, curved lines and a sign that practically screams \u201cWe come in peace\u2026 and we brought pancakes!\u201d, you know you\u2019re in for something special.\n\nThe entrance is flanked by vibrant blue planters, adding a pop of earthly color to the otherwise otherworldly facade.\n\nThis menu is your passport to culinary space exploration. From \u201cLunar Lunch\u201d to \u201cExtraterrestrial Dinner,\u201d each page is a star chart of taste bud adventures. Photo Credit: travelingCAgal\n\nAnd those round windows?\n\nThey\u2019re not just for show \u2013 they\u2019re clearly designed for optimal UFO spotting while you munch on your fries.\n\nAs you step inside, prepare for your jaw to drop faster than a meteorite hitting Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThe interior is a masterpiece of kitschy space-age design, with every nook and cranny carefully crafted to transport you to a galaxy far, far away.\n\nThe ceiling is a marvel in itself, with exposed industrial elements painted a deep blue to mimic the night sky.\n\nHanging light fixtures dangle like stars, casting a warm glow over the dining area.\n\nHouston, we have a problem \u2013 this chicken sandwich looks too good to eat! Crispy, juicy, and served with a side of space-sized onion rings. Photo Credit: Mike Warde\n\nBut the real showstopper is the massive mural adorning one wall.\n\nIt\u2019s a collage of iconic space imagery \u2013 rockets blasting off, astronauts floating in zero gravity, and planets swirling in the cosmos.\n\nIt\u2019s like someone took NASA\u2019s greatest hits album and slapped it on the wall.\n\nThe booths are upholstered in a silvery material that looks suspiciously like the stuff they use to make space blankets.\n\nI half expected to see my own reflection every time I reached for the ketchup.\n\nThe club sandwich: a timeless classic that\u2019s out of this world. Stacked higher than a Saturn V rocket and just as powerful! Photo Credit: George E.\n\nAnd speaking of condiments, even the salt and pepper shakers are shaped like little flying saucers.\n\nIt\u2019s attention to detail like this that really makes the Space Age Restaurant shine brighter than Sirius in the night sky.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the menu, because that\u2019s where things really start to get interesting.\n\nIt\u2019s divided into sections with names like \u201cLunar Lunch\u201d and \u201cExtraterrestrial Dinner,\u201d because why settle for boring old \u201cappetizers\u201d and \u201centrees\u201d when you can have \u201cMartian Munchies\u201d and \u201cCosmic Main Courses\u201d?\n\nThe \u201cLunar Lunch\u201d section is a treasure trove of out-of-this-world delights.\n\nYou\u2019ve got your classic diner fare, but with a galactic twist.\n\nThese waffles are so heavenly, they must have been beamed down from the breakfast planet. Topped with strawberries redder than the surface of Mars! Photo Credit: Gerard C.\n\nTake the \u201cAsteroid Belt Burger,\u201d for instance.\n\nIt\u2019s a hefty patty topped with crispy onion rings that form a ring around the burger, mimicking Saturn\u2019s iconic feature.\n\nAnd let me tell you, it\u2019s a taste explosion that\u2019ll have your taste buds doing zero-gravity somersaults.\n\nFor those looking for something a little lighter, there\u2019s the \u201cMeteor Shower Salad.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a mix of crisp greens, cherry tomatoes (because they\u2019re round like little planets, get it?), and a sprinkle of feta cheese that looks suspiciously like space dust.\n\nFrench toast that\u2019s golden brown and out of this world! Paired with bacon strips that could double as fuel rods for your interstellar journey. Photo Credit: Sy_Bal\n\nThe dressing comes on the side in a little rocket-shaped container, because of course it does.\n\nBut the real star of the show (pun absolutely intended) is the \u201cBlack Hole Sundae.\u201d\n\nPicture this: a swirl of dark chocolate and vanilla ice cream, spiraling into a center of hot fudge so dense that no spoon can escape its gravitational pull.\n\nIt\u2019s topped with whipped cream \u201cstars\u201d and a cherry \u201cred dwarf.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a dessert so intense, it might just alter the fabric of space-time in your mouth.\n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking.\n\nForget rocket fuel, this coffee is the real power behind space exploration. Served in mugs that are more photogenic than a Hubble telescope snapshot! Photo Credit: TheGatesClan\n\n\u201cSure, the theme is cute, but how\u2019s the food?\u201d\n\nWell, let me tell you, it\u2019s not just all flash and no substance.\n\nThe kitchen staff at Space Age Restaurant clearly knows their way around a grill better than most astronauts know their way around a space shuttle.\n\nThe burgers are juicy, the fries are crispy, and the milkshakes are so thick, you might need a rocket booster to suck them through the straw.\n\nRelated: The Legendary Steaks from the Stockyards in Arizona are so Tantalizing, They\u2019ve been Drawing Diners for Generations\n\nRelated: Transport Your Taste Buds to Munich at this Cozy German Eatery in Arizona\n\nRelated: The Hole-in-the-Wall Mexican Food from Carolina\u2019s Mexican Food in Arizona is so Good, Locals Call It the Best in the State\n\nBut what really sets this place apart is the attention to detail in every dish.\n\nTake the \u201cCosmic Club Sandwich,\u201d for example.\n\nIt\u2019s your standard club, but it\u2019s cut and arranged to look like a rocketship on your plate.\n\nMeet your extraterrestrial host! This alien decoration adds a touch of Area 51 charm to your dining experience. Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s more interested in your leftovers than probing. Photo Credit: travelingCAgal\n\nThe toothpick holding it together even has a little paper flag on top, as if it\u2019s just landed on the surface of Planet Lunch.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the \u201cUFO Onion Rings.\u201d\n\nThese crispy, golden hoops are stacked in a tower that would make any alien spacecraft jealous.\n\nThey come with a side of \u201cArea 51 Sauce\u201d that\u2019s so good, it\u2019s probably classified.\n\nBut the Space Age Restaurant isn\u2019t just about the food \u2013 it\u2019s about the experience.\n\nThe staff here are clearly having as much fun as the customers.\n\nThey\u2019re decked out in silver uniforms that look like a cross between a 1960s stewardess outfit and something you\u2019d see in \u201cThe Jetsons.\u201d\n\nEarthlings of all ages, unite! The Space Age Restaurant brings families together faster than the gravitational pull of a black hole. Photo Credit: Becky Tran\n\nAnd let me tell you, these folks are committed to the bit.\n\nI overheard one waiter telling a group of kids that he was actually from Mars, and he\u2019d only come to Earth because he heard the milkshakes were better here.\n\nThe kids were enthralled, and honestly, so was I.\n\nI mean, who am I to argue with a Martian about dairy products?\n\nAs you dine, you\u2019ll notice that the atmosphere is a perfect blend of family-friendly fun and tongue-in-cheek humor that adults can appreciate.\n\nThe walls are adorned with vintage sci-fi movie posters and fake newspaper clippings about UFO sightings in Gila Bend.\n\nAt this cosmic counter, you\u2019re more likely to order a Milky Way Milkshake than a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. But hey, a space cadet can dream!

Analysts now project that quantum computing will drive $1 trillion in economic impact by 2035 \u200b.\n\nThe numbers tell the story of a on the cusp of explosive growth. Enterprise quantum computing alone is set to expand at a staggering 29.7% CAGR , reaching $18.3 billion by 2030 \u200b.\n\nMeanwhile, the broader quantum technology market is forecast to hit $8.3 billion by 2033 , fueled by advancements in quantum sensors, cryptography, and hardware\u200b.\n\nFor retail investors, the opportunities are clear: Quantum computing is transitioning from experimental labs to real-world applications.\n\nRecent breakthroughs, like Google's quantum chip performing calculations faster than any supercomputer\u200b, highlight just how close this technology is to mainstream adoption. Companies securing contracts with major organizations like NASA are laying the groundwork for rapid commercialization\u200b.\n\nRead on to learn how quantum computing is unlocking unprecedented opportunities across industries, and why investors are taking notice.\n\nWhat Is Quantum Computing? Why It Matters\n\nAt its core, quantum computing is a revolutionary technology that leverages the laws of quantum physics to process information in a way that classical computers simply cannot.\n\nUnlike traditional computers, which use bits to represent data as 1s or 0s, quantum computers use qubits , which can exist in multiple states simultaneously through a property called superposition .\n\nThis means quantum computers can perform calculations exponentially faster, solving problems that would take today's most powerful supercomputers years to complete.\n\nAnother critical principle is quantum entanglement , where qubits become interconnected, enabling them to work together to solve complex problems with unparalleled speed and accuracy. Together, these principles allow quantum computers to perform tasks that are currently impossible for classical systems.\n\nRecent breakthroughs are proving that this technology isn't theoretical anymore-it's becoming reality. For example, Google's\u201cWillow\u201d quantum chip recently demonstrated its ability to perform calculations faster than any supercomputer in the world, marking a major step toward practical, large-scale quantum computing\u200b.\n\nThe real-world applications are already staggering:\n\n\n\nCryptography : Quantum computers can crack existing encryption methods while also enabling next-generation quantum-resistant security systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug Discovery : Pharmaceutical companies are using quantum algorithms to simulate molecules and discover life-saving treatments faster and more efficiently.\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) : Quantum computing accelerates machine learning, enabling AI models to analyze vast datasets and improve decision-making in seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply put, quantum computing has the power to reshape entire industries by solving challenges that classical computers can't even approach.\n\nMarket Growth: Quantum Computing Is Scaling Fast\n\nThe quantum computing market is expanding at a pace rarely seen in emerging technologies, offering early investors a unique opportunity to capitalize on exponential growth.\n\nQuantum computing stocks are currently soaring, signalling that the space is\u201cthe next big thing\u201d in tech. Recently the Defiance Quantum Computing ETF (QTUM) surpassed $400 million , showing a 40%+ year-to-date performance.\n\nBut it's worth looking at the companies driving this surge.\n\nRECENT QUANTUM STOCK HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n\u00b7 Quantum Computing (NASDAQ: QUBT) recently announced it had been a prime contract by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to apply its entropy quantum optimization machine, Dirac-3, to support NASA's advanced imaging and data processing demands.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) recently announced the successful application of AI to automate the calibration of a quantum computer with Quantum Machines , the leading provider of processor-based quantum controllers.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) recently completed $175 million in gross proceeds from its $100 million and $75 million\u201cat-the-market\u201d equity offering programs.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 IonQ, Inc. (NYSE: IONQ) recently unveiled its first quantum computer in Europe, achieving the record breaking milestone of #AQ36.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Spectral Capital (OTCQB: FCCN) recently announced a groundbreaking advancement in digital asset management through its partnership with FYNTRA , a pioneer in secure wallet technology, to launch the world's first Quantum Wallet : QVaultTM a leap to providing a Web5 intuitive and secure solution that enables users to seamlessly manage their digital assets in a quantum-powered future.\n\nThe Time to Invest is Now\n\nQuantum computing is on the brink of transforming industries worldwide, marking what experts consider one of the most significant technological breakthroughs of our time. With the potential to drive trillions of dollars in economic impact , this sector offers a rare opportunity for investors to get in early on a revolution that will shape the future.\n\nThe clock is ticking. Quantum computing is no longer a distant dream-it's becoming a reality, with leading companies making rapid advances in both hardware and software. Forward-thinking investors who act now can position themselves to capitalize on the exponential growth this technology promises.\n\nThis is more than an investment in a rising market; it's a chance to be part of a paradigm shift -one that could redefine how industries function, solve problems, and innovate for decades to come."

            "article_content": "Fundamental research in cryptography that\u2019s used worldwide to facilitate internet banking, e-commerce services, and secure messaging systems is now taking root in India as well.\n\nThe principal goal of those developing or using cryptographic systems is to improve system security. Cryptography \u2014 from the English roots of \u201chidden writing \u2014 is the name for techniques that secure information by converting plain text into ciphertext. It is concerned with the creation and use of encrypted messages that only the sender and the receiver can understand and which a malicious actor who interferes with the communication can\u2019t.\n\nSending secret messages isn\u2019t new. Archaeologists have unearthed clay tablets made by the ancient Mesopotamians in which they wrote down cryptic formulae to make ceramic glazes. In the first century BC, the Roman dictator Julius Caesar used the eponymous Caesar cipher to relay messages of strategic value to his generals.\n\nMore recently, many Polish codebreakers fled their country after Adolf Hitler invaded it in 1939 to work with reputed British mathematicians, including the father of modern computing Alan Turing, to crack Germany\u2019s famed Enigma cryptosystem. Turing\u2019s work in particular established much of the foundational theory for modern algorithmic computing.\n\nScientists have devised many sophisticated methods to prevent adversaries from cracking secret codes and gaining unauthorised access to sensitive information. These methods achieve their goals by using algorithms and protocols to protect some data\u2019s confidentiality, integrity, authenticatability, and non-repudiation.\n\n\u2018Hard\u2019 problems\n\nCryptographic algorithms convert messages in ways that make it very difficult, very expensive or both to decode them. A common way to achieve this has been to place some sensitive information behind the answer to a very difficult problem. An agent can access the information by solving the problem, so the harder the problem, the more inaccessible the information.\n\n\u201cHence the search for harder and harder problems \u2014 for instance, even those that quantum computers may find hard to solve,\u201d R. Ramanujam of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, said.\n\nAs computational techniques evolve, particularly with advancements in quantum computing, the interplay between complexity and cryptography will continue to be a crucial area of research and development, he added.\n\nModern cryptographic systems are built on problems that demand far too many resources to be solved.\n\n\u201cAs they say in the crypto community, if your cryptosystem is broken, either a spy is dead or a million dollars is missing,\u201d Ayan Mukherjee, an assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, said. \u201cSuch is the seriousness of the effect of a broken cryptosystem. Thus, oftentimes, people use the old and the trusted to secure their communications.\u201d\n\nThis is also why, he added, \u201cThe field of cryptography is very slow-moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a close connection between complexity theory and cryptography, hence many [researchers] work on these connections, clarifying notions and building finer techniques,\u201d Ramanujam said.\n\nAreas where Indian researchers are working extensively include communication complexity (the amount of communication required to complete a computational task), proof complexity (the computational resources required to prove or disprove statements), and algebraic coding theory (using algebra to encode and decode data).\n\nLocks and keys\n\nThe goal is to make sure an adversary, especially one with enormous computational resources, can\u2019t crack the code. At the heart of any cryptosystem is the key: a secret value an algorithm uses to encrypt or decrypt data.\n\nThe Caesar cipher is a simple example. It works by mapping the existing alphabet to one where the starting letter is offset by some number of letters. This number is the key. For example, if the key is 14, the encrypted alphabet begins with the letter O (the 14th letter) rather than A. Thus the words FIGHT FOR ROME become TWUVH TCF FCAS.\n\nWhen the sender encrypts data with a key, only someone who knows the key can decrypt the message and read it. More sophisticated systems use two keys \u2014 one each for the sender and the receiver \u2014 and map them in a separate secret way.\n\nA famous example is public-key cryptography, which is used to secure information over the internet. The receiver uses a single algorithm to generate two keys called the public key and the private key, and shares the public key with the sender. Any message the sender encrypts with the public key can be decrypted by the private key.\n\nResearchers prefer the algorithms that generate keys to be one-way functions, a name in mathematics for functions that are simple to use but hard to crack. In cryptography, this means they can be used to easily encrypt messages but can\u2019t be cracked without knowing the key. As Ramanujam put it, the challenge is like protecting a house with a strong alarm system that the house\u2019s residents can still use without training.\n\nSome one-way functions are very difficult to crack and thus very secure \u2014 but which also take a long time to decrypt messages. This is one of the principal reasons mining for bitcoins has become a very energy-intensive process. The bitcoin system uses a one-way function that has required more computational resources to decrypt messages as the size of its blockchain has increased.\n\nThis is why some cryptography researchers in India and abroad are working on simplifying the decryption side in particular. Researchers are also considering whether shorter proofs (of the hard problems) can be used to verify the integrity of data in artificial intelligence and large language models.\n\nCryptography isn\u2019t just a mathematical or academic curiosity but is of considerable practical interest, Yael Kalai, whose work on proofs won her the 2022 Turing Award, told the 11th Heidelberg Laureate Forum in September (the author was in the audience). \u201cIn today\u2019s world, the biggest problem we have to solve is trustworthiness,\u201d she said.\n\nSince researchers have solved the problem of authentication and security in communications, she added, the current problem is computation.\n\n\u201cPeople are computing things for us. How do we know that they are computing correctly? How do we certify the huge and often crazy computations people are coming up with? That is a huge new research problem now.\u201d\n\nPossibility of disruption\n\nTwo research areas that could disrupt current cryptographic systems with significant economic and social consequences are homomorphic encryption and quantum information technologies, per a recent paper by the Organisation of Economically Developed Countries (OECD).\n\nHomomorphic encryption is a cryptographic method that allows certain calculations to be performed on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first and without accessing the secret key. The result of such computations remains in encrypted form and can be revealed later, when necessary. According to the paper, this technique could surmount the problem of processing encrypted data without decrypting it first, which increases risk.\n\nSecond, a mature quantum computer could easily break some encryption methods widely used today. Some researchers are thus working on algorithms that can resist attacks powered by a quantum computer, an enterprise called quantum resistant cryptography (QRC). In fact marrying cryptography with quantum physics paves the way for encryption technologies based on the laws of quantum physics, which can be more convoluted than mathematical concepts alone.\n\nResearchers worldwide have been working on QRC since 2006, including in publicly funded research projects in the European Union and Japan. In India, Mukherjee\u2019s group at IISER Pune, and those at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the Raman Research Institute (RRI), both in Bengaluru; the Centre for Development of Telematics, New Delhi; and at Pondicherry University are working on it as well.\n\n\u2018A huge deal\u2019\n\nCryptography research in India is taking off in other aspects, too, catching up with that in the European Union, the U.S., and China. The National Quantum Mission the Cabinet approved in 2023 includes a research hub for quantum communication. The mission is to enable satellite-based secure quantum communications between ground stations over 2,000 km, long-distance secure quantum communications with other countries, inter-city quantum key distribution over 2,000 km, and multi-node quantum networks, among other outcomes.\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation is also planning to launch a satellite with ultra-secure quantum communication capabilities.\n\nIn July, a team of Indian scientists from RRI, IISc, IISER Thiruvananthapuram, and the Bose Institute in Kolkata published a paper describing a way to generate true random numbers that are crucial to making secure private keys and nearly unhackable passwords.\n\n\u201cThis new method offers the enhanced protection we all need in our daily lives, by using truly random numbers to generate keys that will be used to encrypt the passwords,\u201d the Department of Science & Technology said in a statement.\n\nApart from the Ministry of Science & Technology, major government funders for cryptography research in the country include the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Department of Telecommunications.\n\n\u201cThe present status of quantum cryptography is to build quantum-secure cryptosystems,\u201d Mukherjee said. \u201cIt\u2019s based on the idea that, in the near future, we will have quantum computers. When that happens the current cryptosystems will fail. This is a huge deal.\u201d\n\nThe consequences will also affect India\u2019s cryptography policy. According to a recent study commissioned by the Thales Group, the volume of sensitive data in the cloud could surge from 51% of all organisational data to 68% by 2027. As more data enters and lives in the cloud, \u201cencryption techniques for data at rest, in motion, and in use are becoming more pervasive, evolving into a standard practice for protecting cloud-resident sensitive information against emerging cyber threats,\u201d the report said.\n\nThere is widespread data loss as well: the report said almost three-fourths of all organisations have faced multiple data breaches in the past year, foremost due to inadequate encryption. Some 71% initiated formal cryptographic programmes and 81% have dedicated encryption teams.\n\nT.V. Padma is a science journalist in New Delhi."

Alexa and Siri are two names she is familiar with, just like 'Mama' and 'Papaa.'\n\nWhen she cries, we say, \"Alexa, tell Raaha to stop crying,\" Alexa blinks blue and green, luring her to think it's her friend. And she stops crying.\n\nWhen tears roll down her cheeks, Alexa's soothing lullabies often succeed where parenting hacks fail. A simple command transforms chaos into calm. This isn't the splashy tech revolution futurists warned about.\n\nDon't forget the foundation. AI here is not forced. It didn't announce itself. It's here to weave itself into the fabric of daily life. Like a flawless merger.\n\nA decade ago, Skype calls felt like science fiction; toddlers swipe through virtual classrooms today without batting an eye.\n\nSimilarly, today's AI-powered toys, chatbots, and voice assistants will become as banal as microwaves by the time Generation Alpha enters middle school. The shift is happening in the mundane moments.\n\nAlgorithms suggest learning apps tailored to individual needs. Toys respond to emotional cues, fostering a strange form of companionship. And yet, these tools are less about transforming life and more about streamlining it. For today's kids, there's no awe or fear. It's just life.\n\nAI's creeping omnipresence creates a paradox.\n\nOn one hand, it's a miracle of modernity. Need a quick science lesson? AI tutors have you covered. Want to track developmental milestones? Machine learning apps will cheerfully send reminders. But this efficiency comes at a cost. If Alexa answers every curious \"why,\" will children still learn the joy of discovery? If empathy is simulated, will they grasp the depth of real human connection?\n\nAlso Read: AI in the real world\n\nI wrestle with these questions daily. I marvel at AI's ability to ease daily burdens. As a sceptic, I wonder: Are we outsourcing too much? AI may smooth the edges of chaos, but it also raises a nagging fear\u2014what happens when the lines between human and machine blur too much?\n\nOutside the home, the AI ecosystem is reshaping every facet of society. Schools are piloting AI tutors that promise personalised education, a far cry from one-size-fits-all classrooms. In healthcare, AI tools detect patterns in patient data, offering diagnostics faster than human doctors. Even our social interactions are subtly guided by recommendation algorithms dictating what we see, read, and share.\n\nBut with ubiquity comes complacency. Who ensures these systems remain ethical while children grow up surrounded by invisible, algorithmic hands? Bias in AI is no theoretical issue. A 2019 study found that facial recognition software misidentified Black and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more frequently than white ones. When these systems shape our children's realities, vigilance isn't optional\u2014it's imperative.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe next frontier for AI isn't innovation\u2014it's normalisation. Systems will become more personalised, more humanlike, and more integrated into the spaces we inhabit. Picture this: smart homes seamlessly adapting to moods, smart cities optimising every resource, and AI tools that learn not just how we think but how we feel. Our children will inherit this reality\u2014a world where AI doesn't stand out; it blends in.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI will be part of their lives. It's whether it will shape them more than they shape it.\n\nA Quiet Revolution, Carefully Tended\n\nIt's to make life a little smoother, a little easier quietly. As parents, educators, professionals and citizens, our responsibility is to ensure this transition is thoughtful and deliberate. AI shouldn't raise our children. It should support us in raising them.\n\nIn business, think of AI as a dependable assistant. It simplifies tasks, spots problems, and lets leaders focus on big-picture decisions. It's not the boss; the behind-the-scenes helper keeps everything running smoothly.\n\nIn education, AI works like a helpful tutor. It finds where students struggle and offers the right tools to support them. But the teacher inspires creativity, critical thinking, and emotional growth\u2014skills no machine can truly replace.\n\nAlso Read: Human intelligence must guide artificial intelligence\n\nFor now, I'll keep asking Alexa to play lullabies when the chaos peaks. But I'll also keep asking myself harder questions. Will this ecosystem of AI enhance our humanity\u2014or dilute it? The answer, perhaps, lies in how we choose to nurture this strange, quiet revolution. Maybe it's not as scary as it's portrayed in the movies, as it's quietly evolving into our regular ecosystem anyway.\n\nPersonally, I'm okay with AI if it can help my baby stop crying. More okay with it helping me automate the most boring task in my profession."

            "article_content": "The quantum computing revolution is changing technology as we know it. Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations far beyond the capabilities of traditional computers.\n\nThis transformative technology has the potential to revolutionize diverse sectors, including medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence (AI). Underscoring this point, a recent McKinsey & Co. research report projects that quantum computing could generate a whopping $1.3 trillion in economic value by 2035.\n\nJust as the internet boom created giants like Amazon and Google, quantum computing could give rise to a new generation of industry-leading companies, offering early investors the potential for extraordinary gains. Imagine a future with personalized medicines, revolutionary materials, and supercharged AI -- all made possible by quantum computing.\n\nLet's take a closer look at two quantum computing stocks that could represent once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for early shareholders.\n\nTrapped-ion quantum computing leader\n\nIonQ (IONQ -6.40%) is emerging as a potential leader in the commercialization of quantum computing through its trapped-ion technology approach. Unlike traditional superconducting quantum competitors, IonQ's architecture operates at room temperature and demonstrates strong qubit connectivity, with the company's Forte system delivering 36 algorithmic qubits at 99.9% fidelity -- marking significant performance advantages that could translate into a formidable competitive moat as the technology matures.\n\nWhile some quantum computing companies focus on the number of physical qubits, IonQ uses \"algorithmic qubits\" to represent the computational power available after accounting for error correction and other factors that affect algorithm performance. This metric aims to provide a more practical measure of a quantum computer's ability to solve real-world problems.\n\nBeyond the core technology, IonQ's execution has been notable. The company has consistently beaten aggressive roadmap timelines, secured a major $54.5M Air Force Research Lab contract, and established partnerships with heavyweights like pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and engineering simulation software leader Ansys.\n\nWhile quantum computing stocks are notoriously speculative, IonQ's manufacturing facility opening and modular multicore architecture as a potential path to scaling suggest the company has a credible shot at capturing a meaningful share of the vast and potentially unparalleled quantum computing market.\n\nSuperconducting quantum pioneer\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI -12.54%) takes a distinctive approach to quantum computing, focusing on superconducting technology and vertical integration. Unlike room-temperature trapped-ion systems, Rigetti's architecture leverages established semiconductor manufacturing processes at the company's dedicated Fab-1 quantum foundry, potentially offering advantages in scaling and gate speeds in the years ahead.\n\nWhile qubit count is one progress metric, Rigetti emphasizes gate fidelity as a key performance metric. The company's latest Ankaa-3 system achieves 99% median iSWAP gate fidelity and 99.5% median fidelity for fSim gates -- critical benchmarks that reflect the system's ability to perform reliable quantum operations with minimal errors, which is necessary for practical applications.\n\nBeyond the technical foundations, Rigetti's execution showcases strategic positioning. The company has secured its role as the quantum hardware provider for the U.K.'s National Quantum Computing Centre, established partnerships with financial leaders like HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, and maintains strong ties with the Air Force Research Lab and Fermilab's SQMS Center.\n\nWhile quantum computing remains an emerging field with significant technological hurdles, including maintaining qubit coherence, Rigetti's full-stack approach and innovative multichip architecture, combined with flexible deployment options through major cloud platforms and the QCS Direct cloud service, suggest the company is well positioned to compete in the evolving quantum computing landscape.\n\nA quantum computing revolution\n\nAs quantum computing advances from research labs toward commercial reality, IonQ and Rigetti demonstrate the potential technological paths that could make quantum computing a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity. Each company combines innovative architectures with strategic partnerships and clear commercialization strategies that could provide paths to capturing market share.\n\nWhile the technology remains highly speculative and faces significant technical hurdles, companies that successfully scale their systems while maintaining high performance could deliver unprecedented returns. As these potential quantum leaders emerge, investors must monitor technical progress, partnership momentum, and execution against stated roadmaps."
