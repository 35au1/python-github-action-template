            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nOver a span of several days last week, multiple sightings of UFOs were made in the Fresno, California area with no explanation ever revealed. A couple of the UFO sightings were even reported to the local airport tower by pilots.\n\nThe first UFO sighting occurred early in the morning when a light was recorded in the sky by a news tower camera just after 4 a.m. Fox 26 News reported that \u201cthe light appeared to hover over downtown Fresno.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you see that object move at the clip it moves and it\u2019s hovering again,\u201d said Earl Grey Anderson from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), who reviewed the footage. \u201cThat one I would probably actually give an unknown classification to which is a UFO.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I thought was very interesting about the second video is the clip. It suddenly moves. I\u2019m not sure what distance we\u2019re looking at there. It wasn\u2019t light speed or anything like that but that was awfully fast. You\u2019ve got an interesting capture there somebody saw what I would technically call a UFO.\u201d\n\nThe day after the initial UFO sighting, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara captured video of another UFO in the time, this time in broad daylight.\n\nThree days later, during the afternoon, a private pilot radioed the Fresno airport tower with a report of something unidentified in the sky. A second pilot reported an object following him at 3,500 feet.\n\nTower: \u201cYou saw something over downtown at 3,500?\u201d Pilot: \u201cCorrect. It looked like a white object.\u201d Tower: \u201cHow long was this?\u201d Pilot: \u201cI just lost it right now.\u201d\n\nSeveral other people in the area also reported taking video of similar objects in the sky at the time. Jeanette Herrera of Fresno reported seeing it on back-to-back days, and it\u2019s not the first time she has seen UFOs over the city.\n\n\u201cI saw that one video of the orb and I was like\u2026 well, wait a second. I\u2019ve got good video of these things,\u201d said Herrera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve filmed that particular orb at least three or four times in the last two weeks,\u201d Herrera continued, \u201cIt almost does this like firework thing where it blows up and then reappears in a different area. So, it just does that constantly and then sometimes it won\u2019t. It\u2019ll just stay like a little solid looking orb.\u201d\n\nA Fresno police helicopter, which investigated the one of the pilot\u2019s reports, and efforts to reach the Federal Aviation Administration in Fresno both proved fruitless for providing an explanation for the mysterious UFO sightings."

            "article_content": "Nobody expected anything special when the squadron of Navy F/A-18 fighter jets headed out for routine aerial maneuvers off of the coast of Virginia Beach one day in 2013. The F/A-18s, a Naval workhorse, owned the local air space that day\u2014but only until they didn\u2019t.\n\nAll at once, the jets\u2019 radar picked up a cluster of half a dozen objects flying along with them, moving erratically\u2014and entirely acrobatically. At some moments they ripped along side-to-side at speeds exceeding 350 knots\u2014or 402 mph. Then, suddenly, they would stand utterly still in winds that themselves were moving at 150 knots (172 mph)\u2014gusts that had the jets struggling to maintain position. Then the objects would accelerate again. They had no visible exhaust, no discernible means of propulsion, and indeed looked nothing like any aircraft in the nation\u2019s civilian or military arsenal.\n\nMeasuring five to 15 ft. across, they were a \u201cdark gray or black cube inside a clear sphere,\u201d former Navy Lieutenant Ryan Graves, who was aloft that day, tells TIME. \u201cWe almost hit one of the objects; they came within 50 ft. of the lead aircraft, and that's really when we knew we were dealing with something a bit abnormal here. There's no aircraft in our inventory I'm aware of that has the ability to operate at very low speeds, or no speeds, and then accelerate and operate like a fighter.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the last time the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP)\u2014the genteel, modern-day term for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO)\u2014harrassed the Navy. \u201cWe saw them in Virginia Beach between 2013 and 2015,\u201d says Graves. \u201cLater, when we executed training operations aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt off the coast of Jacksonville, Fla., they were either already down there or they had followed us down, because we had over a dozen incidents, two of which were recorded [by the Navy] and released by The New York Times in 2017.\u201d\n\nThose videos, known popularly as \u201cthe Gimbal,\u201d after the objects\u2019 pinwheeling motion, are just part of the eyewitness visuals featured in the new PBS NOVA documentary \u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d premiering on PBS stations on Jan. 22. And Graves is just one of the many people who have borne witness to them who offers his accounts. The documentary traces the arc of UFOs and UAPs in American skies, from June 24, 1947, when aviator and businessman Kenneth Arnold reported the first widely publicized sightings of flying saucers, to the present, when accounts of UAPs have exploded, with 801 reported to the military since 2023 alone. Within the Pentagon\u2019s $65 billion \u201cblack budget\u201d of classified expenditures, an estimated $22 million has reportedly been spent on its Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which investigates UAPs.\n\nEven before that contemporary program, the U.S. military was keenly interested in the provenance of UFOs and UAPs, as the NOVA film documents. From 1947 to 1969, the Air Force ran a secret\u2014though since declassified\u2014program dubbed Project Blue Book, which investigated 12,618 sightings of flying objects. Of these, 701 remain unidentified. Some of the earliest reports, from 1947 to 1949, were sightings of military assets that were part of the Department of Defense\u2019s Project Mogul, under which the Air Force lofted high altitude balloons carrying sensitive microphones designed to pick up sonic signatures of Soviet nuclear tests. The initial rumors of extraterrestrial doings at Roswell, N.M. stemmed from a local rancher collecting debris from a balloon that descended on his land.\n\nIn the 21st century there is a lot more airborne traffic giving rise to a lot more potential false UAP alarms. More than 1,800 weather balloons are launched worldwide everyday, according to the NOVA documentary, and the Federal Aviation Administration reports that over one million registered drones are in private hands in the U.S. Plenty of what is reputed to be aliens likely has a perfectly banal terrestrial explanation. But sightings like the gimbal are a lot harder to explain away\u2014a point proven by another UAP incident known colloquially as the Tic Tac.\n\nIn 2004, the U.S.S. Nimitz Carrier strike group off the coast of southern California picked up repeated radar reflections of flying objects that would rapidly appear and disappear from tracking screens. During those intervals when they were visible, they would fly in a looping, diving, and skittering path, rapidly dropping from 80,000 ft. to 20,000 ft. and hovering there. Finally, Naval pilot David Fravor and others were sent aloft to investigate and found their quarry\u2014a 45-ft. long flying machine that for all the world resembled in both color and shape a Tic Tac breath mint.\n\n\u201cAll four of us looked down and saw a Tic Tac object with a longitudinal axis pointed north-south and moving very abruptly over the water, like a ping pong ball,\u201d said Fravor in 2023 testimony before Congress. \u201cThere were no rotors, no rotor wash, or any sign of visible control surfaces like wings. The object suddenly shifted its longitudinal axis, aligned it with my aircraft and began to climb. As we pulled nose onto the object within about a half mile of it, it rapidly accelerated and disappeared.\u201d\n\nVideo of the encounter was released by the Navy which has never offered a theory as to what it was.\n\nLike the Tic Tac and the Gimbal, the hundreds of other unexplained UAPs continue to flummox experts. Graves is now executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, a nonprofit that collects sightings of UAPs with an eye toward helping to shape the public conversation around unidentified objects and deconflict airspace. He does not pretend to know what the bogeys are\u2014but he\u2019s pretty sure what they\u2019re not.\n\n\u201cI don't think that we're seeing an adversary demonstrating capability beyond our state of the art during these relatively low reward, high risk operations,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be able to take these technologies that we're not aware exist and to put them basically directly over our homeland, in a position to be captured and reverse engineered\u2026I don't see that. I don't see that logic.\u201d\n\nEqually unlikely is that the craft are highly classified domestic technology that much of the military has not been tipped off about. \u201cThese were airborne assets that were exhibiting capabilities beyond our state of the art,\u201d Graves says. \u201cAnd what I mean by state of the art is technology that would take greater than 10 years for the U.S. to develop, if they started now.\u201d\n\nThat leaves non-earthly origins and Graves, for one, does not speculate on that score. \u201cI don't think we have the proper definitions to go down that road,\u201d he says, \u201cwithout having a better way of defining how we would determine whether something is truly from another star system\u2026[whether] these objects are using magical physics that we don't understand.\u201d\n\nThe NOVA film does offer other explanations. Conspiracy debunker Mick West, author of Escaping the Rabbit Hole, theorizes that it\u2019s not the object in the gimbal video that\u2019s doing the moving but the camera that captured the image, creating merely the illusion of motion\u2014though that doesn\u2019t explain what the object, which would be stationary in this case, actually is. In another\u2014infrared\u2014video in which the object appears to disappear and reappear, West suggests that the camera might be capturing the image of a bird that reached thermal equilibrium with the background temperature and thus simply seemed to vanish.\n\nThe filmmakers leave viewers with pretty much as many questions as they greet them with\u2014which fairly matches the state of the UAP art. With up to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way and an estimated 200 billion galaxies in the universe, there are uncounted trillions of planets that could host a highly technological civilization. Whether one of those civilizations would send any of their flying machines to our lonely world\u2014and why they\u2019d bother\u2014is impossible to say. But the sightings keep coming\u2014even if the answers remain elusive."

            "article_content": "Credit: Rainer Fuhrmann/Shutterstock\n\nAccording to a 2022 poll from YouGov, 39% of Americans believe they have some form of paranormal ability. About a quarter of that group think they can sense other people's auras or emotion; 15% say they can hear voices or sounds from ghosts; and about 13% think they can see events from the past or future.\n\nThis is a public service announcement to the nearly 13 million Americans who believe they have supernatural powers: You are leaving a lot of money on the table. Various groups of skeptics worldwide have put a total of $1,408,424 (and one goat) on the table, and all that filthy lucre is just waiting to be collected by anyone who can manifest paranormal power.\n\nThe specific kinds of powers you need to demonstrate to win the prizes run the gamut. Dutch organization Stichting Skepsis will shell out 12 grand to practitioners of some forms of alternative medicine who can demonstrate its effectiveness (so if you're into applied kinesiology, give 'em a shot), and you can get a free goat from Fayetteville Freethinkers for proving a \"fulfilled Biblical prophecy.\" But whether you're able to see the future, move objects with your mind, or talk to spirits, there's a prize out there for you.\n\nThe history of paranormal prizes\n\nThe first monetary prize for proof of paranormal activity was offered by Scientific American in 1922. In the midst of the spiritualism movement, the publication offered $2,500 for anyone who could produce a \"spirit photograph\" (a photo that captures an image of a ghost) under controlled conditions, and $2,500 for anyone able to produce a \"visible psychic manifestation.\"\n\nFamous (at the time) medium George Valiantine gave it a shot and was able to create the illusion of a trumpet floating in the air in a dark room, but the test committee (which included Harry Houdini) had connected his chair to a light in an adjoining room, which lit up whenever Valiantine left his chair, which was also every time the trumpet appeared. Valiantine was proven a fraud, and Scientific American kept their cash.\n\nThe most famous bounty for psychic ability is the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi, a magician turned professional skeptic, first offered a prize of $1,000 back in 1964, but the cash grew to a million by 1996. Between 1964 and 2015 when the prize was discontinued, over 1,000 people applied, but none were successful at demonstrating their supernatural power under controlled conditions. No remote viewers were able to remote view. No dowsers were able to find hidden objects. No mind reader was able to read minds.\n\nHow paranormal prizes can backfire\n\nYou'd think that a 100% failure rate might make people question the reality of psychic abilities, but for a lot of people, public failure can make psychic abilities seem more plausible. At least that's how it worked for Uri Geller. Geller, who's still around and still claiming supernatural power, began gaining attention in the early 1970s for his supposed ability to bend spoons with his mind.\n\nWhile he never tried for James Randi's prize, the two had a famous run-in on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show that demonstrated the problems with disproving paranormal activity. Carson, who had been magician, was skeptical of Geller's claims, and brought him on his show and presented him with some tests that Randi helped develop.\n\nIf you want to see some uncomfortable TV, check it out:\n\nIf you don't have the 20 minutes to spare, Carson lets Geller take his time and try any of a series of test of his ability, but Geller can't. With Carson watching carefully and not allowing Geller control of any of the props, Geller can't bend a spoon with his mind; he can't determine whether a container holds water. He can't do anything.\n\nYou'd think a public failure this complete would have ended Geller's career, but it had the opposite effect. Geller blamed his failure on \"not feeling strongly\" and claimed he might have been \"blocking himself\" that night. Many apparently saw Geller's failure as proof that he was the real thing; after all, if he was a magician, the tricks would have worked. Geller then became a popular guest on other talk shows where he was able to perform his tricks successfully under less controlled conditions, and a star was born.\n\nWhy disproving anything is difficult\n\nWhile Uri Geller and other high-profile psychics are performers and are no doubt aware of how they're achieving their results, the 13 million or so Americans who believe they possess special powers aren't being deceitful\u2014it's just easy to believe in the supernatural. When something unusual happens, when a one-in-a-million occurrence occurs, it's easy to see that as proof of a mysterious, unexplainable something. If you're thinking about a friend and they text you that very minute, how can you not see that as evidence of some weird connection? But one-in-a-million events happen to over 300 people in America every single day, and there's no James Randi or Johnny Carson around to provide a controlled experiment to prove it's just a coincidence, to explain that you probably think of people all the time who don't text you that minute.\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong. If I am, there's over a million dollars and a goat out there waiting for the right person to come along and claim them."

            "article_content": "Steven Soderbergh has never made a horror movie, and certainly not of the ghostly, haunted variety. His movies tend to be exacting, precise, so even when they\u2019re frightening, as with the stalker nightmare Unsane or the chilling disease thriller Contagion, that fear comes from witnessing a process failing with just as much efficiency as when it succeeds. Death, as depicted in his new horror thriller Presence, has no such clarity of success and failure. The sense of loss left behind feels like a kind of failure, yet it is both inevitable and unknowable. These are some of the mysteries eating away at teenage Chloe (Callina Liang), who has just lost her best friend Nadia to a drug overdose and is now moving into a new house with her semi-functional family.\n\nYes, it\u2019s the old something-not-quite-right-with-this-house-that\u2019s-supposed-to-solve-everything business: Chloe feels shivers of offness in her new home, which concerns her sweet-natured but frustrated father Chris (Chris Sullivan) and mostly annoys her jock brother Tyler (Eddy Maday)\u2014who is the clear favorite of distracted mother Rebecca (Lucy Liu), further bedeviled by some vague but obviously Soderberghian financial malfeasance at work. As far as Rebecca is concerned, that\u2019s the issue that should require discussion in hushed tones, not the creaks and chills of otherness that Chloe feels. Is it Nadia, Chloe wonders? Or just, as her parents assume, an expression of her grief and loneliness?\n\nThe identity question may linger, but there\u2019s no fake suspense over whether Chloe is imagining things. To depict this haunting, Soderbergh imposes a system onto a spiritual dimension where none should necessarily exist: He shoots the entire movie from the point of view of an unseen spirit that does indeed drift through the house; \u201cpresence\u201d is also, essentially, the title character. It\u2019s a Paranormal Activity movie turned inside-out: Rather than a largely stationary camera capturing flickers of spooky but eerily realistic movement in the frame, the camera remains mobile and hovering, its ghostliness an invisible but driving force. Like the Paranormal films, there is an element of surveillance: The camera travels through rooms unnoticed, overhearing bits of conversation and observing actions kept secret from other characters. It\u2019s at once omniscient and deeply subjective. There\u2019s also another technical challenge on hand for Soderbergh, who has professed far more affinity for the cut than the epically long take: to stay true to his POV gimmick, most scenes are staged in single unbroken shots. Cuts move forward in time, not within a scene.\n\nThe simultaneous braininess and gimmickry of this technique, applied to a David Koepp screenplay that unapologetically eschews A Ghost Story-style metaphysical traversing, could have stranded Presence in a liminal zone between shlock and airless experiment. What Soderbergh winds up achieving is more reminiscent of his throwback crime pictures, like the Criss Cross remake The Underneath or more recent thrillers like the period noir No Sudden Move and the intensely Early 2020s Kimi. That is to say that Presence has the story, limited scope, and 85-minute runtime of a 1940s B-picture, infused\u2014as those pictures often were, and as his crime movies usually are\u2014with a disciplined style and contemporary electricity. It\u2019s budget Gothic that\u2019s worth every penny and then some.\n\nIn that context, it\u2019s less surprising that Soderbergh didn\u2019t recruit anyone from his ever-growing unofficial rep company for this cast: No Matt Damon as the dad, no Catherine Zeta-Jones as the mom, no Riley Keough as a cool aunt dropping by. (Julia Fox, however, does have one scene as a real-estate agent. No word on whether she\u2019s bumpin\u2019 that.) The central quartet playing the family all does wonderful work, and in a movie with several talented young performers, frequent stage/TV/character actor Sullivan feels like the belated discovery as the flustered but loving father. The familial relationships that Soderbergh and Koepp set up aren\u2019t necessarily wide-ranging or unpredictable, but as Presence ticks toward an inevitable confrontation, they\u2019re surprisingly involving. There\u2019s a circularity to Presence that is both entirely in keeping with a haunted-house story and, in this telling, even moving. It\u2019s yet another genre that Soderbergh has worked like a problem, and produced an elegant solution.\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nWriter: David Koepp\n\nStarring: Callina Liang, Chris Sullivan, Lucy Liu, Eddy Maday, Julia Fox\n\nRelease Date: January 24, 2025"

Fans are lucky because, in this bottomless ocean of sci-fi content, there are a ton of projects worth seeing or reading for one reason or another.\n\nGiven the amount of sci-fi television, there are dozens of great series that fail to capture mainstream audience attention on par with Battlestar Galactica or Star Trek. However, that doesn't mean these are the only shows worthy of praise.\n\nFrom cult space operas to overlooked gems from the United Kingdom, here are 25 of the best, most underrated sci-fi TV series ever made.\n\nHeroes\n\nImage Credit: NBC Universal Television Studio.\n\nAcross the globe, ordinary people begin to discover that they have superhuman abilities. These individuals include an indestructible Texas cheerleader (Hayden Panettiere), a Japanese office worker who can teleport (Masi Oka), and a serial killer able to absorb other people's powers (Zachary Quinto).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIgnoring the disastrous final two and a half seasons, you're left with a taut, realistic superhero show that nearly dethroned Lost in its exceptional first two seasons.\n\nV\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Television.\n\nShortly after the events of V: The Final Battle, the hostile alien race known as the Visitors have returned to Earth, planning to conquer the planet with the help of several traitorous humans.\n\nA continuation of the 1983 miniseries and its follow-up, V: The Final Battle, V is a bold and imaginative space opera start-up in the same overly stylized mold as Star Wars (in the best way imaginable, of course).\n\nAlmost Human\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Television.\n\nIn the near future, a depressed human detective (Karl Urban) is assigned an android partner (Michael Ealy), and their professional relationship slowly blossoms into friendship.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore Karl Urban was fouling up superheroes on The Boys, he was a sci-fi sensation with vastly underrated works like Dredd and this AI-focused study of man and machine.\n\nDr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\n\nImage Credit: Mutant Enemy Productions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAspiring to one day join the prestigious Evil League of Evil, up-and-coming supervillain Dr. Horrible's (Neil Patrick Harris) plans are complicated when he falls for a kind-hearted woman who begins dating his nemesis (Nathan Fillion).\n\nA wonderfully written musical comedy, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog skewers the superhero genre in two, coming across a more adult version of Megamind.\n\nManiac\n\nImage Credit: Michele K. Short / Netflix.\n\nAnnie (Emma Stone) and Owen (Jonah Hill) are strangers drawn into a strange pharmaceutical company's test program for an experimental new drug.\n\nLed by solid performances from Stone and Hill \u2014 along with a memorably odd Justin Theroux \u2014 Maniac is a hallucinatory trip where, like the characters, you're never entirely sure of what you're seeing.\n\nRed Dwarf\n\nImage Credit: Grant Naylor Productions.\n\nDave Lister (Craig Charles) is a low-ranking technician aboard the mining spaceship Red Dwarf. Awaking from a three million-year-long cryogenic hibernation, Lister is shocked to find himself the last human in the universe.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis little-known British export may not have much of a fanbase in the States, but its success speaks for itself: 12 seasons, four novels, and even a magazine from '92 to '94.\n\nPlanetes\n\nImage Credit: Sunrise.\n\nIn 2075, galactic travel has become an average part of life. However, debris from spacecraft has become commonplace, requiring specialists to collect the waste and ensure smoother trips for passing ships.\n\nThough that premise may sound comedic, the joy of Planetes is its basis in hard science and its heavy focus on existential themes.\n\nSpace Battleship Yamato\n\nImage Credit: Office Academy.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn 2199, Earth has been turned into a radioactive wasteland by an invasive alien race. In desperate need of an environment to sustain them, the spaceship Yamato travels to the planet Iscandar, believing the planet has the means to make their home hospitable again.\n\nReleased in 1974, Space Battleship Yamato has regularly been one of the most influential anime series there is, inspiring everything from Mobile Suit Gundam and Neon Genesis Evangelion to the iconic video game sensation Space Invaders.\n\nLost in Space\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Fox Television.\n\nThree decades into the future, Earth begins establishing colonies on distant planets across the stars. Crash-landing on a habitable world, the Robinson family defends themselves against their hostile environment and tries to return to their expeditionary party.\n\nWhenever a remake of a beloved '60s show premieres, there's bound to be a comparison between the original and the remake. Hinging heavily on its emotional undertones, Lost in Space does much to set itself apart from its earlier counterpart.\n\nThe Wild Wild West\n\nImage Credit: CBS Productions.\n\nIn a steampunk version of the Wild West, two government agents (Robert Conrad and Ross Martin) travel the frontier, ridding the land of any dangerous threats they come across.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDesigned to be a Western version of James Bond (complete with wacky gadgets, physically imposing henchmen, and dastardly villains), it's one thousand times better than that godawful Will Smith movie.\n\nFinal Space\n\nImage Credit: Conaco.\n\nWhile working off his prison sentence, astronaut Gary finds companionship in a mysterious yet adorable alien \u2014 who also happens to be one of the most dangerous creatures in the universe.\n\nBrimming with an all-star cast (David Tennant, Steven Yeun, Fred Armisen, Conan O'Brien, Jane Lynch, and Keith David), Final Space starts as your typical Adult Swim comedy before slowly morphing into an out-and-out space opera of epic proportions.\n\nThe 100\n\nImage Credit: The CW Network/CBS Television Studios.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNearly a century after a nuclear war has ended civilization on Earth, the remnants of humanity send 100 troubled youths to the world's surface in the hopes of reestablishing humankind's presence on the planet.\n\nA post-apocalyptic version of Lord of the Flies, The 100 is an acquired taste for some, but those who love a good, teen-driven drama won't be disappointed.\n\nThe OA\n\nImage Credit: Plan B Entertainment/Anonymous Content.\n\nHaving gone missing seven years ago, a blind young woman named Prairie (Brit Marling) returns home, her eyesight somehow completely restored.\n\nCanceled at the worst time imaginable, leaving infuriated fans with an unresolved cliffhanger, The OA has regularly been called one of the best sci-fi shows of all time by publications like Empire, Wired, and the BBC.\n\nResident Alien\n\nImage Credit: Universal Content Productions/SYFY.\n\nTasked with destroying Earth, an alien disguised as a friendly Colorado doctor (Alan Tudyk) wrestles with the morality of his mission, made even more complicated by all the kind-hearted humans he meets along the way.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nResident Alien's greatest strength is always entertaining Alan Tudyk, but more than that, it's an unexpectedly emotional look at a very different kind of alien invasion.\n\nOrphan Black\n\nImage Credit: Christos Kalohoridis/Temple Street Productions.\n\nAfter witnessing the suicide of a woman who looks exactly like her, the street-savvy Sarah (Tatiana Maslany) decides to take the woman's place, pulling her into a world of sinister conspiracies around every corner.\n\nIn her transformative performance as Sarah, Maslany propels Orphan Black to sci-fi heights, the show existing an intense and intelligent meditation on cloning and the ethics (or lack thereof) involved in the process.\n\nThe Venture Bros.\n\nImage Credit: World Leaders Entertainment.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOnce a famous boy inventor, Dr. Rusty Venture has since grown up to be a depressed, crotchety middle-aged mad scientist. Together with his two less-than-intelligent sons and their burly bodyguard, the four embark on numerous adventures the world over.\n\nA spoof of classic '60s Hanna-Barbera cartoons like Jonny Quest, The Venture Bros has amassed a significant following since its 2003 debut. However, even the most dedicated of fans can't deny it tends to be overshadowed by more recent Adult Swim series like Rick and Morty.\n\nBabylon 5\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Television.\n\nIn the 23rd century, the galaxy is once again beginning to stabilize after a massive war between the Earth Alliance and the Minbari. Stationed at a strategic neutral zone is the station Babylon 5, a site of political intrigue and maneuvering by both sides of the conflict.\n\nIf ever you were looking for a more political space opera, this is it. Tackling such themes as political factions, Cold War power struggles, and racism, Babylon 5's reputation among sci-fi enthusiasts has only improved with time.\n\nFuture Boy Conan\n\nImage Credit: Nippon Animation Co.\n\nTwenty years after World War 3, the remnants of mankind live on a chain of islands as they slowly try to rebuild society. In the middle of it all is Conan, a 12-year-old boy with superhuman strength trying to find an 11-year-old girl who's been kidnapped by the insidious forces of Industria.\n\nA very early work from anime giant and Studio Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki, Future Boy Conan bears all the charm and imagination of Miyazaki's later work, serving as a direct precursor to his breakthrough Castle in the Sky.\n\nLegion\n\nImage Credit: Michelle Faye/FX Networks/The Donners' Company/Bad Hat Harry Productions/Kinberg Genre/Marvel Television/FXP.\n\nDavid Haller (Dan Stevens) is a powerful telepathic mutant diagnosed with acute schizophrenia. After he's contacted by a fellow patient (Rachel Keller) in a psychiatric facility, David starts to suspect that there's more to his mental illness than he originally believed.\n\nFrom Noah Hawley (creator of the similarly underrated FX series Fargo), Legion is about as heady and psychedelic a superhero show as you can get.\n\nThe Outer Limits\n\nImage Credit: United Artists Television.\n\nThe immediate competitor to The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits is a '60s anthology series exploring tales of sci-fi and cosmic horror.\n\nSure, The Outer Limits is commonly recognized as a classic example of the TV anthology, but its contribution to pop culture tends to pale in comparison with Rod Serling's monumental fantasy-based series.\n\nThe Expanse\n\nImage Credit: Penguin in a Parka.\n\nIn the 24th century, a weary police detective (Thomas Jane) and a hardened freighter captain (Steven Strait) search for a missing young woman, threatening the balance of power amongst the colonized planets of the galaxy.\n\nA deft blend between space opera and neo-noir, The Expanse is a rich mystery series wrapped around an audacious sci-fi war story \u2014 one that may rival the likes of Stargate SG-1 or Babylon 5.\n\nFringe\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Television.\n\nWith mounting cases of unexplained, possibly supernatural phenomena spreading throughout the country, the FBI establishes a small team of investigators (Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson, and John Noble) to research and solve any mysteries they deem paranormal in nature.\n\nWhat The X-Files did for government conspiracy theories, Fringe does for fringe science. Delving into an expansive mythology as rich as Supernatural's, it's the best monster-of-the-week show viewers have never seen.\n\nUtopia\n\nImage Credit: Kudos.\n\nDiscovering a strange comic book that holds predictions for future events, a group of people are hunted down by an enigmatic organization known as The Network, who wish to keep the comic a secret.\n\nForget the horrendous American remake, the original British series is an ambitious and affecting piece of storyline, despite its heavy dose of extreme, often off-putting violence.\n\nFirefly\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Fox Television.\n\nFive hundred years into the future, a ragtag crew aboard the transport ship Serenity do their best to find their place in the galaxy, running from authoritarian government regimes, bounty hunters, and a horrendous subhuman race known as Reavers.\n\nNowadays, it seems almost a given that any list of underrated sci-fi shows ends with Firefly. Unjustly canceled after a single season, it's continued to live on in the form of numerous comics, board games, and a feature film continuation."

An Oscar winner was demanding more, not the minimum, of a reporter\u2019s time?\n\nIt was noteworthy then when a rep for Steven Soderbergh emailed to say that the director of \u201cErin Brockovich,\u201d \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d and the \u201cOcean\u2019s\u201d trilogy was doing interviews for his new movie, but would not agree to any conversation of less than 45 minutes.\n\nNormally, a week or two before a movie is released, the \u201ctalent\u201d is made available for interviews. But time is always tight and, in the end, reporters are lucky if they can wrangle 15 minutes on the phone with an actor or director.\n\n\u201cThis is for my mental health,\u201d Soderbergh, 62, explained a few weeks later. \u201cI realized very early on that an interview in which you only have enough time to ask the three things you know you have to ask wasn\u2019t very satisfying for me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy favorite interview I ever gave was four hours with a German newspaper when \u2018Sex, Lies and Videotape\u2019 was being released,\u201d he said.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nThe Globe did not get four hours of the filmmaker\u2019s time \u2014 the publicist politely called a halt after about an hour. But Soderbergh, who has directed, on average, a movie a year for more than three decades, delights in what he does. \u201cIt\u2019s the best job in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I could prove that in a court of law.\u201d Hence he was keen to talk, not only about his latest film, \u201cPresence,\u201d but whatever else a journalist unconstrained by the clock might want to ask.\n\nIn style and substance \u201cPresence,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, is a departure for Soderbergh. It\u2019s not a heist film (\u201cLogan Lucky\u201d); crime drama (\u201cTraffic\u201d); sci-fi flick (\u201cSolaris\u201d); disaster movie (\u201cContagion\u201d); unconventional biopic (\u201cChe,\u201d \u201cBehind the Candelabra\u201d); or shameless crowd-pleaser (\u201cMagic Mike.\u201d) It\u2019s a ghost story.\n\nChris Sullivan and Lucy Liu in \"Presence.\" Peter Andrews/The Spectral Spirit Company\n\nThe supernatural tale starring Lucy Liu, Chris Sullivan, Callina Liang, Eddy Maday, and Julia Fox is about a suburban family who moves into a new house and quickly discovers that something else also lives there. But what makes \u201cPresence\u201d so unnerving isn\u2019t the story, it\u2019s the way Soderbergh has chosen to tell it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film, which takes place in a single location, is shot entirely from the phantom\u2019s point of view; the audience sees and experiences everything that happens from the perspective of the ghost. Soderbergh filmed the POV himself, which effectively put him in every scene. (To avoid making a sound, the director wore slippers as he moved through the house with the camera.)\n\n\u201cI was excited by the all-or-nothing aspect of the gimmick,\u201d he said. \u201cI always operate the camera, but this was next level. I\u2019m really in there with the actors.\u201d\n\nCallina Liang, Chris Sullivan, Eddy Maday, Lucy Liu, and Julia Fox in \"Presence.\" Peter Andrews/The Spectral Spirit Company\n\nA POV approach is not uncommon in horror. (Examples include \u201cThe Blair Witch Project,\u201d \u201cCloverfield,\u201d and \u201cParanormal Activity.\u201d) But the perspective here is stable; Soderbergh\u2019s ghost doesn\u2019t have the same fidgety field of vision as many other cinema specters.\n\n\u201cWhen you walk down the street, your point of view is not shaking,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been nauseating to have your eyeballs dancing like that for 85 minutes.\u201d\n\nLiang, who plays Chloe, the teenage daughter who first senses that something isn\u2019t quite normal about the family\u2019s new home, didn\u2019t know what to expect when she showed up on set. \u201cIf Steven\u2019s going to be doing a horror film, he\u2019s going to be doing it his way,\u201d Liang said.\n\nCallina Liang in \"Presence.\" Sundance Institute\n\nShe soon realized that the director would be her primary scene partner for the 11-day shoot. \u201cA lot of my scenes, obviously, were with Steven because a lot of my scenes were with the ghost,\u201d the actress said. \u201cIt was fun. We were able to choreograph it, almost like a dance, stepping around each other and making sure our movements are in sync.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA willingness to experiment has been a hallmark of Soderbergh\u2019s career. There was the time he tried to distribute and market his movies himself. (It didn\u2019t work.) And his decision to use an iPhone to make the 2018 psychological thriller \u201cUnsane\u201d and the 2019 sports drama \u201cHigh Flying Bird.\u201d (Soderbergh said he was inspired by the aesthetic of Sean Baker\u2019s 2015 movie, \u201cTangerine,\u201d which was shot on an iPhone.)\n\n\u201cThere are endless possibilities for how to do something, and your job as a director is to arrive at the optimal version of what this thing wants to be,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile many of his films have enjoyed enormous commercial success \u2014 the \u201cOcean\u2019s\u201d franchise has grossed over $1 billion worldwide and \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d earned $250 million and five Academy Award nominations \u2014 Soderbergh, who won a best director Oscar for \u201cTraffic\u201d in 2000, said he isn\u2019t bidding for a box-office triumph every time out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a diet,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to just make movies that are going to travel the art-house circuit, and I don\u2019t want to just make things that I think are broadly commercial. I want to do both.\u201d\n\nIt looked for a while like he might not get the chance. After his first film, 1989\u2019s \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape,\u201d won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival, as well as the audience award at Sundance Film Festival and an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay, Soderbergh made several films \u2014 \u201cKafka,\u201d \u201cKing of the Hill,\u201d \u201cThe Underneath,\u201d and \u201cSchizopolis\u201d \u2014 that bewildered more than bowled over audiences. But 1998\u2019s \u201cOut of Sight\u201d flipped the script. Nominated for two Academy Awards (best adapted screenplay and best film editing), the action-comedy, starring George Clooney as a smooth criminal and Jennifer Lopez as the federal agent on his tail, established Soderbergh as a director capable of making a Hollywood hit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s certainly a known quantity now, but Soderbergh doesn\u2019t believe he has the cache of some filmmakers \u2014 and that\u2019s fine with him.\n\nSteven Soderbergh attends \"Presence\" New York premiere at AMC Lincoln Square Theater on Jan. 16 in New York City. Arturo Holmes/Getty\n\n\u201cNobody is going into a meeting and pitching a project saying, \u2018I want it to be like a movie directed by (Soderbergh).\u2019 They may say, \u2018I want it to be a movie like \u2018Out of Sight,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut my name alone isn\u2019t enough to make a movie a hit. There are only a couple of people who meet that metric.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy to exist in a space that allows me access to restaurants, but nobody stops me on the street ever,\u201d he said.\n\nBarely an hour before the Globe interview, the death of David Lynch was announced. Asked about the director of \u201cEraserhead,\u201d \u201cElephant Man,\u201d \u201cBlue Velvet,\u201d and \u201cMulholland Drive,\u201d Soderbergh praised him as a one-of-a-kind artist.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re either an original or you\u2019re a synthesist. I\u2019m a synthesist and David Lynch was an original,\u201d said Soderbergh. \u201cPart of the way to measure the worth of someone like David Lynch is to imagine if none of his work existed and what a hole there would be in American cinema.\n\n\u201cFor David Lynch to have never been is unthinkable,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s left for Soderbergh? A lot, it seems. The director, who once famously retired because he was frustrated with the business of making movies, said he continues to think of new stories and of creative ways to tell them on screen. (His 2013 retirement lasted just a few months.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ll never get to the end,\u201d Soderbergh said of directing. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s impossible to figure out a formula that solves all the problems on every movie, and that\u2019s humbling in a way that keeps me hungry to learn more.\u201d\n\nMark Shanahan can be reached at mark.shanahan@globe.com.

In recent months, leading AI labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic got involved in pushing the narrative of \u201cbeating China\u201d in what appeared to be an attempt to align themselves with the incoming Trump administration. The belief that the US can win in such a race was based mostly on the early advantage it had over China in advanced GPU compute resources and the effectiveness of AI\u2019s scaling laws.\n\n\n\nBut now it appears that access to large quantities of advanced compute resources is no longer the defining or sustainable advantage many had thought it would be. Read the full story.\n\nMeet the divers trying to figure out how deep humans can go\n\nFiguring out how the human body can withstand underwater pressure has been a problem for over a century, but a ragtag band of divers is experimenting with hydrogen to find out.\n\nThis is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we\u2019re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

            "article_content": "The UK retail industry is at a pivotal juncture, driven by technological advancements, evolving consumer expectations, and a heightened focus on sustainability. With 2025 on the horizon, retailers are keenly adapting to key trends that promise to redefine the shopping experience. From artificial intelligence-enhanced operations to the rise of ethical retailing, along with innovative financial solutions, these developments are all playing a crucial role in shaping the future of retail.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and machine learning power personalised retail\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing the retail industry, driving significant transformations across businesses of all sizes. While large multinational retailers are at the forefront of adopting these technologies, other sectors, including healthcare and iGaming platforms like crypto casinos UK players can sign up to are also finding innovative ways to harness AI-driven insights.\n\nAcross sectors, AI is being used to provide highly customized client experiences. In the casino sector, personalised promos and game suggestions based on user history are just two uses of AI. Elsewhere, machine learning algorithms are enhancing operational efficiency by optimising inventory levels, predicting demand, and improving supply chain management.\n\nAI chatbots and virtual assistants are becoming indispensable in customer service, offering instant support and resolving queries in real time. Studies indicate that retailers using AI and ML have witnessed an increase in sales and a boost in profitability.\n\nOmnichannel retail becomes the new norm\n\nConsumers increasingly expect a seamless shopping journey across multiple channels, whether they\u2019re browsing online, visiting a physical store, or using a mobile app. As a result, retailers are doubling down on their omnichannel strategies to create a unified experience.\n\nKey initiatives include the implementation of Click and Collect services, real-time inventory visibility across platforms, and streamlined return processes. Retailers are also investing in mobile-friendly shopping platforms, ensuring customers can switch between devices without losing progress in their shopping journeys.\n\n\n\nA notable example is the integration of social media with e-commerce platforms. Through social commerce, brands are allowing consumers to shop directly through platforms like Instagram and TikTok, blurring the line between social engagement and online retail.\n\nSustainability takes centre stage\n\nEnvironmental consciousness has become a deciding factor for today\u2019s consumers, prompting retailers to prioritise sustainability. From product sourcing to packaging, every aspect of retail operations is being scrutinised for its environmental impact.\n\nMajor players in the UK market, including grocery giants and fashion retailers, are stepping up their efforts to reduce carbon footprints. Initiatives such as switching to biodegradable packaging, committing to zero waste, and promoting circular fashion through resale or rental services are becoming increasingly common.\n\nRetailers that emphasise transparency in their supply chains and communicate their sustainability goals effectively are finding favour with environmentally conscious shoppers. This trend is not only shaping buying behaviour but also fostering brand loyalty among a growing segment of eco-minded consumers.\n\nAdvanced technologies streamline operations\n\nTechnological innovation continues to drive efficiencies in the retail sector. A prominent development in this regard is the gradual replacement of traditional barcodes with QR codes. Unlike barcodes, QR codes can store more information and offer consumers additional product details, enhancing the overall shopping experience.\n\nLeading UK supermarkets, including Tesco and Ocado, have already begun rolling out QR codes on select products, such as milk cartons. This move is part of a broader trend towards digitisation aimed at improving both back-end operations and front-end customer interaction.\n\nIn addition to QR codes, retailers are adopting in-store technologies such as smart shelves and automated checkout systems to enhance convenience. The ultimate goal is to reduce friction at various touchpoints, making shopping faster and more enjoyable for consumers.\n\nRising trend: responsible consumerism and the decline of \u2018haul culture\u2019\n\nThe introduction of \u2018haul culture,\u2019 popularised by social media, has led to increased consumption and, consequently, higher return rates. This phenomenon, driven by younger consumers eager to showcase their shopping hauls online, poses significant challenges for retailers in terms of logistics and sustainability.\n\nIn response, many brands are adopting strategies to curb excessive returns, including improved product descriptions, enhanced sizing tools, and augmented reality (AR) fitting solutions. Retailers are also working to educate consumers on the environmental impact of returns and promote thoughtful purchasing habits.\n\nAdditionally, there is a growing emphasis on responsible consumerism. Retailers are encouraging shoppers to make more sustainable choices by highlighting the longevity and ethical sourcing of products. This trend reflects a broader cultural shift towards mindful consumption and away from fast fashion and impulsive buying.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe retail landscape in 2025 is set for significant transformation as businesses adapt to technological advancements, sustainability pressures, and changing consumer behaviours. Retailers that successfully navigate these trends stand to benefit from increased customer loyalty, operational efficiencies, and long-term profitability.\n\nAs AI-driven personalisation, omnichannel experiences, and ethical practices become standard, the future of retail promises to be both exciting and dynamic. Brands that remain agile and responsive to these developments will not only survive but thrive in this evolving marketplace."

            "article_content": "DeepSeek, a Chinese Artificial Intelligence startup, has launched a new model that it claims is on par with OpenAI-o1.\n\nIn a recently released paper, the startup noted that its new flagship AI model, R1, showed a new level of reasoning. It tweeted, \u201cDeepSeek-R1 is here. Performance on par with OpenAI-o1. Fully open-source model and technical report. MIT licensed: distill and commercialise freely.\u201d\n\nAccording to experts, this product is a huge leap in terms of scale and efficiency and may upend expectations of how much power and computing will be needed to manage the AI revolution, considering it was done on a cheaper budget than AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nRead also: Investment in GenAI to rise by 60% in 3 years\n\n\u201cDeepSeek R1 is 100 percent open source and 96.4 percent cheaper than OpenAI o1 while delivering similar performance. OpenAI o1: $60.00 per 1M output tokens DeepSeek R1: $2.19 per 1M output tokens,\u201d tweeted Shubham Saboo, a senior AI product manager in the US.\n\nArnaud Bertrand, founder of HouseTrip and Me & Qi, noted on X, \u201cIt\u2019s essentially as if someone had released a mobile on par with the iPhone but was selling it for $30 instead of $1000.\u201d\n\nAccording to DeepSeek, R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. Its research paper states that this is possible because of pure reinforcement learning. According to Jim Fan, senior research manager at Nvidia, this technique is why Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaZero is a master at games like Go and Chess from scratch.\n\nDeepSeek, launched in 2023, explained in its paper that its goal is to explore the potential of AI to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data. It noted that an earlier version of R1, called R1-Zero, gave it an \u201caha moment\u201d in which the AI \u201clearned to allocate more thinking time to a problem to reevaluating its initial approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are living in a timeline where a non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive \u2013 truly open, frontier research that empowers all. It makes no sense. The most entertaining outcome is the most likely,\u201d tweeted Jim Fan.\n\nHe noted that DeepSeek\u2019s R1 is not only an open source but also spills all the training secrets of AI models. Bertrand of Me & Qi explained that the open source nature of R1 will enable plenty of AI applications that were unaffordable before.\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cSay, for instance, that you want to build a service that helps people summarize books (random example). In AI parlance, the average book is roughly 120,000 tokens (since a \u201ctoken\u201d is about 3/4 of a word and the average book is roughly 90,000 words).\n\nRead also: Artificial Intelligence (AI) \u2013What impact will it have on education?\n\n\u201cAt OpenAI\u2019s prices, processing a single book would cost almost $2 since they charge $15 per 1 million tokens. DeepSeek\u2019s API, however, would cost only $0.07, which means your service can process about 30 books for $2 vs just 1 book with OpenAI: suddenly your book summarizing service is economically viable.\u201d\n\nHe noted that DeepSeek has changed the AI game. OpenAI began the AI race when it launched ChatGPT in November 2022. However, models from tech giants such as Google and Meta and those from across the world are catching up.\n\nShare"

            "article_content": "(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Alex Gerko\u2019s quantitative-trading firm XTX Markets is investing more than \u20ac1 billion ($1 billion) building five data centers in Finland to underpin its growing use of machine learning.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe London-based market maker, which uses complex algorithms to trade over $250 billion worth of assets a day, will build the hub in the area around Kajaani, in central Finland, where it owns a 478-acre site, XTX said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe first data center, which it expects to complete next year, will have a floorspace of 15,000 square meters \u2014 approximately equivalent to two football pitches \u2014 and the whole project may take about five years.\n\nXTX is bucking the industry trend of farming out its computational needs to third-party run infrastructure \u2014 which can be a comparatively fast process. Chief Technology Officer Joshua Leahy says the firm\u2019s big bet on using machine learning to produce price forecasts means it\u2019s ultimately more cost-effective and easier to guarantee capacity with its own infrastructure.\n\n\u201cBy building things ourselves, we can build ahead of our needs,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBecause of the way we use machine learning to build our trading strategies, we have been confident that we can apply more compute power to ultimately generate better returns.\u201d\n\nFinland\u2019s cool climate has attracted similar investments from other companies and Alphabet Inc. also announced a \u20ac1 billion investment last year. Kajaani is already home to Europe\u2019s LUMI supercomputer, one of the fastest globally.\n\nA former Deutsche Bank AG trader, Gerko has built XTX Markets into one of the world\u2019s largest algorithmic firms, trading in equities, fixed income, currencies, crypto and more. In a sign of its AI ambitions, XTX has launched a new division for machine-learning researchers and amassed over 25,000 graphics processing units \u2014 the chips often used in training AI models.\n\nThe first data center will host 22.5 megawatts of power and include a 50-person office space, the firm said. On paper, the facility will produce more waste heat annually than Kajaani \u2014 with a population of about 40,000 \u2014 uses year-round, XTX said.\n\nThe area\u2019s \u201cnatural low air temperature\u201d will be used for cooling purposes to avoid taking water away from the locality, it said. XTX is also looking at ways that the heat generated by the data center can be provided free of charge to the local community, according to the statement."

            "article_content": "Rupay Credit Card on UPI\n\nCustomers using RuPay credit cards linked to UPI do 40 transactions per month average, eight times higher than traditional credit card users, according to an analysis done by RuPay credit card fintech Kiwi.\n\nThe higher frequency helped RuPay corner a 12 percent market share for card transaction volume in 2024, compared to the three percent the payment network had in 2023, the Kiwi report said.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nBoth RuPay and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) are run by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). UPI is the country\u2019s most popular digital payment method cornering around 85 percent of all such transactions.\n\nRuPay is a domestic card network that competes with global giants Visa and Mastercard. Only RuPay cards are allowed to be linked to UPI as per the regulations.\n\nThe cumulative monthly transaction value of RuPay is around Rs 14,000 crore, while the overall credit card network value is around Rs 1.8 lakh crore, which translates into a 7.5 percent market share in value.\n\nAround two-thirds of all RuPay credit card transactions happen through UPI. A year ago, RuPay was doing around Rs 10,000 worth of transactions in a month, of which 50 percent came through UPI.\n\nWhile RuPay is the most successful debit card platform with more than 80 percent of the market share in cards issued, it trails Visa and Mastercard in credit cards, where the spending is much higher. However, with the linking of RuPay credit cards with UPI, the platform has now cornered a 25 percent market share in new credit cards issued in the country. There are around 10.5 crore active credit cards in the country as per the Reserve Bank of India data.\n\nHowever, RuPay network's popularity has been surging over the last year as customers get the best of credit card rewards with the convenience and reach of UPI. While there are only 9o lakh card-accepting merchants, there are an estimated 32 crore UPI merchants.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nRuPay credit card spending is growing at 5 percent monthly, reaching an average of Rs 40,000 per user, according to data available with Kiwi. The company, is one of the early adopters of enabling virtual RuPay credit cards (issued by Axis Bank and Yes Bank) that can be linked with their UPI accounts. Kiwi has raised a little less than $20 million until now and does around Rs 300 crore worth of transactions in a month.\n\nHowever, the average transaction value is Rs 1,100, much lower compared to Visa and Mastercard, where the average transaction value is around Rs 4,000. This is mostly because the cards are still mostly used for daily small-value payments, where the customers earlier used to pay with UPI.\n\n\u201cUPI-enabled credit cards are transforming how millions of Indians engage with credit, By combining the convenience and widespread acceptance of UPI with the power of credit, we are seeing a new wave of financial inclusion. This empowers individuals with more responsible, accessible, and transparent financial tools, driving a shift towards smarter spending habits and responsible credit usage,\u201d says Mohit Bedi, cofounder of Kiwi.\n\nThis surge is benefiting local retailers and small merchants, with 75 percent of transactions being conducted at grocery shops and other small businesses in the country.\n\nDue to a high merchant discount rate \u2013 or the commission that merchants pay to card issuing banks and payment providers \u2013 most small merchants are reluctant to accept credit cards. On the other hand, merchants using RuPay credit cards on UPI are charged fees only for transactions exceeding Rs 2,000, making them particularly attractive to small businesses that previously avoided credit cards. RuPay had also faced some resistance from merchants in the past.\n\nMost credit card users have more than one credit card and customers are increasingly opting for virtual RuPay credit cards as their second or third, with 50 percent of these cards being digital ones. They are also more popular with younger customers with around 45 percent of users in the under 30 age group, and another 30 percent of users between ages 31 and 40.\n\nThe rise of RuPay has been helped by the regulatory diktats. Last year, RBI mandated all card issuers (mostly banks) to offer consumers the option to choose their card network when applying for a new credit card or when renewing their credit cards. This ended the decades-old way of banks entering into exclusive agreements with Visa and Mastercard. In August, NPCI also directed banks to ensure RuPay credit cardholders receive rewards on par with other networks.\n\nRuPay\u2019s growing foothold in the domestic credit card market is particularly significant as geopolitical tensions highlight the importance of domestic payment systems. The recent exclusion of Russian payment systems from global networks like Visa and Mastercard has underscored the need for nations to develop independent solutions.\n\nNPCI is working with several countries to develop a similar domestic card network. It is also entering into bilateral partnerships with other countries that will enable international RuPay card payments without the help of other card networks."

            "article_content": "PC makers are of the view that quick commerce players with strong execution will be able to drive sales, as demand for high-value electronics on quick commerce continues to rise.\n\nAfter delivering groceries, daily essentials, medicines, and smartphones in ten minutes, quick commerce platforms like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart are now adding laptops to their offerings.\n\nOver the last month, several of the largest personal computer (PC) makers in India\u2014including HP, Lenovo, Acer, and Asus\u2014have listed their products on at least one of the major quick commerce platforms.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nMarket leader HP recently announced a partnership with Blinkit to sell laptops, monitors, printers, and other accessories on the platform.\n\n\u201cThe initial response has been promising\u2026We are also gradually diversifying our presence by introducing laptops on quick commerce platforms, adopting a phased approach to better understand consumer behaviour and preferences,\u201d Vineet Gehani, Senior Director, Personal Systems, HP India, told Moneycontrol.\n\nSimilarly, Acer has listed a limited range of its offerings, including laptops, on platforms like Flipkart Minutes and Zepto in select locations. It is also in \u201cactive talks\u201d with Blinkit and others to bring a complete range of Acer products \u2013 including laptops, monitors, tablets and accessories \u2013 to quick commerce.\n\n\u201cWe are confident of this channel for long-term growth. Quick commerce players are actively solving challenges related to inventory management and last-mile delivery for high valued Items like laptops, tablets, and other electronic items,\u201d said Sudhir Goel, Chief Business Officer Acer India.\n\nLaptops are the latest development in the ongoing strategy of quick commerce firms to deliver big-ticket products. Electronic gadgets like smartphones and laptops drive up average order values (AOVs), which in turn fuels margin improvements for quick commerce platforms. In fact, Blinkit, on January 22, announced a partnership with Xiaomi and Nokia to expand its smartphone category beyond iPhones.\n\nTesting the waters\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nWhile firms like HP and Acer have started selling laptops, other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are testing the waters by listing accessories like keyboards, mice, and printers, to gauge initial demand.\n\nTaiwanese PC manufacturer Asus, for instance, announced a partnership with Zepto last week to list a range of accessories, including keyboards and mice, on the platform, made available in major cities like Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru.\n\n\u201cWe also plan to expand its presence on other quick commerce platforms such as Blinkit and Instamart further broadening our reach and ensuring greater accessibility for consumers across India,\u201d said Arnold Su, Vice President, Consumer and Gaming PC, System Business Group, Asus.\n\nLenovo, India\u2019s second-largest PC marker, is adopting a similar approach of listing smaller tech accessories. It is, however, seeing sales gradually pick up for larger ticket items. Its products are currently available on Blinkit.\n\n\u201cCurrently, on Zepto, our Lenovo Tab M11 is the most purchased tablet and we\u2019re optimistic about scaling this channel further to enhance accessibility and convenience for our customers,\u201d said Dinesh Nair, Director of Consumer Business, Lenovo India.\n\nNew growth channel\n\nIndia\u2019s traditional PC market (inclusive of desktops, notebooks, and workstations) shipped an all-time high of 4.49 million units in the third quarter of calendar year 2024, up 0.1 percent year-over-year (YoY), amid the festival season last year, according to a report by the International Data Corporation (IDC).\n\nHP led the market with a share of 29 percent, followed by Lenovo and Dell Technologies with a market share of 17.3 percent and 14.6 percent, respectively. The Acer Group occupied the fourth spot at 14.6 percent again, with Asus rounding out the top five at 9.7 percent, the report showed.\n\nAs the country\u2019s PC market continues to grow, India's $5.5 billion quick commerce market is emerging as the next phase of online growth for many PC manufacturers.\n\n\u201cWe believe quick commerce is the future of e-commerce and offers us a new avenue to expand our reach and serve more customers,\u201d said Su.\n\nAccording to the Asus executive, traditional e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon have not been able to meet the growing need for faster deliveries, and quick commerce has emerged as a channel that can complement existing online platforms.\n\n\u201cWhile some may perceive quick commerce as a threat to established online players, we view it as an opportunity to reach a niche customer base in need of products beyond just daily groceries or FMCG items,\u201d he said.\n\nFor other OEMs, it is still early days and quick commerce is currently just another channel that they want to expand their presence to.\n\n\u201cAs a brand, our focus remains on serving our customers across all platforms\u2014whether it\u2019s through offline retail stores, online and e-commerce channels, or emerging quick commerce solutions. By embracing innovative distribution models, we are ensuring that our customers can access HP products wherever and whenever they need them,\u201d said HP\u2019s Gehani.\n\nEarly days for laptops on quick commerce\n\nWhether laptops take off in a big way via quick commerce remains to be seen. Analysts tracking the sector expect the category to make up a small share of quick commerce sales for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cIt will require considerable effort to scale the laptop and PC category on quick commerce. Sales in this category are expected to remain between 2-3 percent in the medium term,\u201d said an internet sector analyst.\n\nRegardless, PC makers are of the view that quick commerce players with strong execution will be able to drive sales, as demand for high-value electronics on quick commerce continues to rise.\n\n\u201cThis depends on how quick commerce players are going to solve the need for a larger selection for buyers along with the convenience of delivery in 10-30 minutes,\u201d said Goel."

            "article_content": "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are needed for businesses to have good control over key processes such as accounting, supply chain, manufacturing, HR and many more. In recent years, however, with the advent of cloud computing, businesses now have a choice to deploy ERP solutions on-premise or in the cloud.\n\nCloud and on-premise ERPs have vastly different integration capabilities and methods. In order to decide which integration approach would be better for a business, you need to consider factors like cost, scalability, data security and customizability.\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive comparison between cloud and on-premise ERP integrations across critical factors that technology decision-makers must consider before selecting an integration approach. It also offers advice on determining if your business is better suited for the cloud or on-premise ERP ecosystem based on your operating model, growth objectives and enterprise architecture.\n\nCloud ERP Integration Overview\n\nERP solutions for the cloud from ERP software development services can be hosted on vendor or third-party servers and accessed through the Internet. With this deployment model, businesses don\u2019t have to invest in on-premise hardware and ERP infrastructure.\n\nCloud ERP systems such as Oracle NetSuite, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, and Infor CloudSuite are more commonly built using modern API-led connectivity protocols rather than traditional on-premise approaches like batch data transfers or point-to-point integration.\n\nKey integration capabilities with cloud ERP deployments include:\n\nReal-time data sync between cloud ERP and other SaaS apps via APIs\n\nSimple app integration through cloud ERP marketplaces\n\nPrebuilt connectors to popular SaaS platforms like ecommerce, payments, marketing automation etc\n\nEDI and supply chain integration through cloud B2B networks\n\nIntegration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) for interfacing legacy on-premise systems\n\nAgility and Speed\n\nThe API-led architecture of cloud ERP systems integration accelerates the implementation of new apps and workflows to keep pace with business priorities. IT can build integrations in days/weeks rather than months with on-premise ERPs.\n\nLower TCO\n\nWith cloud ERP system integration, there is no need for upfront capital expenditure on integration software, hardware and middleware. Businesses only pay for used capacity as an operating expense.\n\nScalability\n\nYou can easily scale prebuilt and custom integrations to handle higher transaction loads as your ERP data integration volume grows without disruption. Usage-based pricing allows paying for only additional capacity.\n\nEnhanced Data Security\n\nCloud ERP vendors spend a lot of money on advanced security controls like encryption, tokenization, role-based access etc., and the integrations built using these systems also come with the same security capabilities.\n\nInnovation Velocity\n\nCloud ERP platforms are often updated, so their integration capabilities utilize the latest technologies, such as AI/ML, blockchain, advanced analytics, etc. On-premise systems do not provide these latest integration features.\n\nKey Challenges with Cloud ERP Integration\n\nWhile cloud ERP integrations accelerate digitization, some downsides need consideration:\n\nVendor dependence risk\n\nBusinesses become technologically wedded to the cloud ERP vendor. Migrating large data volumes across systems is challenging if the provider relationship turns sour later.\n\nCustomization constraints\n\nAlthough configuration is possible, custom-coding cloud ERPs like SAP S/4HANA Cloud are restricted. It limits bespoke modification of prebuilt integrations.\n\nIntegration costs add up\n\nWhile cloud ERP software integration needs lower initial investment, custom development and licensing connector apps in the marketplace incur ongoing costs.\n\nIntegration testing limitations\n\nCloud ERP vendors don\u2019t always fully simulate live production scenarios during integration ERP system testing, which can hinder the anticipation of post-go-live issues.\n\nCloud vendor technical support\n\nWhile some cloud ERP vendors provide prompt, expert technical support for complex integration issues and niche troubleshooting that requires troubleshooting skills, others don\u2019t.\n\nOn-Premise ERP Integration Overview\n\nSAP ECC, Oracle E-Business Suite, and Infor LN are ERP software installed on on-premises servers in the company system. The administration of the ERP platform and databases and the management of upgrades, security patches, and fixes are all the responsibilities of the IT team.\n\nLegacy B2B protocols like EDI and point-to-point middleware have historically dominated integration architectures for on-premise ERP deployments. However, modern integration tools like Boomi, MuleSoft and Microsoft BizTalk now empower API-based connectivity even with on-premise ERPs.\n\nHere are some of the prominent ERP integration methods with on-premise ERP platforms:\n\nEDI for B2B data interchange with supply chain partners\n\nPoint-to-point integration using middleware\n\nAPI connectivity to/from ERP using an integration platform (iPaaS)\n\nBatch data integration for periodic large data transfers\n\nOn-premise or hosted integration platform installations\n\nChange data capture for detecting and propagating updates\n\nEnterprise service buses (ESB) for routing integration traffic\n\nProcess integration with business process management (BPM) tools\n\nWhile cloud integration delivers agility, on-premise ERP integration brings other strategic advantages:\n\nCustomization Freedom\n\nOn-premise ERPs allow modifications to source code to enhance and tailor prebuilt integrations. They offer greater flexibility than cloud ERPs.\n\nBetter Legacy Connectivity\n\nOn-premise ERP software integration tools have well-established legacy protocol adapters that seamlessly interface with outdated systems. Thus, it is easier to retain legacy compatibility while upgrading an integrated ERP system.\n\nContinuity During Outages\n\nIntegration processes are minimally disrupted when the internet goes down as servers are inside the corporate firewall. The problem is that if externally hosted systems become unavailable, cloud integration workflows stop.\n\nStricter Data Security\n\nDirect control over servers without surrendering them to cloud vendors for stringent compliance and security reasons are some highly regulated industries such as defense and banking, etc.\n\nSuperior Support Mechanisms\n\nOn-premise ERP platforms allow easier leveraging of internal IT talent and external system integrators for technical support during complex integration issues. Resolution times are faster.\n\nKey Challenges with On-Premise ERP Integration\n\nHowever, businesses pay a steep price for the wide-ranging control and customizability delivered by on-premise ERP integration in certain areas:\n\nInflexible and slow\n\nDiplomatic protocols and point-to-point links between on-premise ERP and surrounding systems make agile integration challenging. Responding to changing needs involves prolonged development and testing cycles.\n\nSubstantial hardware demands\n\nMaintaining high-performance infrastructure for integration middleware, databases, backup systems etc., drives up capital expenditure costs with on-premise ERP integration.\n\nScaling limitations\n\nPhysical capacity in the on-premise data center constricts the addition of integration infrastructure to handle higher transaction volumes during business growth.\n\nVendor dependence\n\nWhile customization is possible, skilled resources for legacy ERP platforms like SAP ECC are dwindling. This compels businesses to pay premiums for vendor consulting.\n\nWaning innovation\n\nVendors are focused on developing their cloud ERP offerings. As a result, fewer cutting-edge features reach on-premise product versions through upgrades, causing integration capabilities to lag.\n\nMaking the Right Choice: Cloud vs On-Premise ERP Integration\n\nWhile both cloud and on-premise ERP integration models have trade-offs, the right choice depends on your business priorities and IT landscape:\n\nTransaction volume \u2013 High-volume integration needs may require on-premise for optimal performance\n\nHigh-volume integration needs may require on-premise for optimal performance Budget \u2013 Cloud integration with pay-per-usage may suit mid-market firms reluctant to large upfront investment\n\nCloud integration with pay-per-usage may suit mid-market firms reluctant to large upfront investment Agility needs \u2013 Frequently changing integration needs favor cloud ERPs for swift reconfiguration\n\nFrequently changing integration needs favor cloud ERPs for swift reconfiguration Compliance needs \u2013 Heavily regulated industries may prefer on-premise for localized security control\n\nHeavily regulated industries may prefer on-premise for localized security control Legacy landscape \u2013 Lots of outdated surround systems prefer on-premise integration with better legacy bridges\n\nLots of outdated surround systems prefer on-premise integration with better legacy bridges Innovation culture \u2013 Businesses that reward innovation gravitate towards cloud ERP\u2019s latest integration features\n\nBusinesses that reward innovation gravitate towards cloud ERP\u2019s latest integration features Application landscape \u2013 A predominantly cloud-based application portfolio suits cloud ERP integration, while on-premise apps align with on-premise ERP integrations\n\nIn addition, if an organization has a long-term hybrid enterprise architecture strategy, it can use both cloud and on-premise integration models at the same time.\n\nFor example, you can keep legacy on-premise ERP integration and cloud ERP integration with new SaaS capabilities. It allows you to pivot from existing systems to becoming cloud native at a sensible pace, keeping the critical operations running.\n\nThe bimodal integration architecture will align business IT objectives in terms of agility, innovation and risk mitigation.\n\nConclusion\n\nCloud ERP integration addresses serious challenges like inflexibility, upgrade headaches, and high total cost of ownership of legacy on-premise ERP platforms, albeit with its limitations: vendor dependency and customization constraints.\n\nWhile cloud ERP integration has compelling advantages for most modernizing enterprises, it deserves a careful analysis of your integration needs, IT ecosystem, business priorities and target operating model before you leap.\n\nAs cloud ERP adoption picks up sharply through 2025, the selection of integration technology now represents a watershed moment for the right digital transformation and innovation cadence.\n\nAfter methodically weighing the pros and cons of available integration approaches, choose wisely when to go with one, and then avoid modernization journeys that are completely misaligned and can seriously impede what you are trying to achieve with modernization."

            "article_content": "Sharing Data Makes Every Agency Stronger\n\nIn the realm of public safety and security, the integration of open architecture surveillance systems promises to significantly enhance interagency collaboration and operational efficiency.\n\nOpen architecture surveillance dissolves traditional barriers of proprietary systems, enabling a seamless flow of information among public sector entities, including law enforcement, emergency services, municipal administrations and even private sector organizations.\n\nThe collaborations that stem from these central, shared insights foster a unified approach to public safety that helps all factions involved do more with less. This, in turn, augments the collective capacity to respond to emergencies, manage resources and ensure safer cities.\n\nRELATED: Law enforcement agencies and utilities will digitize physical security in 2025.\n\nData-Driven Decision-Making Enhances Law Enforcement Outcomes\n\nIn 2019, law enforcement in Canada deployed a real-time intelligent center that integrates various streams of information, including live surveillance footage from stationary or body-worn cameras, social media monitoring, actionable insights, data analytics and other intelligence sources. This stream of data provides law enforcement officers with improved awareness into ongoing incidents and potential threats.\n\nBeyond law enforcement, these centers often support broader public safety efforts, including emergency response coordination, disaster management and event security planning. For example, officers can work with other units, government entities and private organizations to centrally access aggregated event video feeds, data analytics and intelligence that may indicate emerging threats or criminal activities. This allows for a swift and unified response to incidents, where personnel are better equipped and directed where they are most needed.\n\nWith open architecture, surveillance systems shift toward interoperability and flexibility, and devices such as sensors, infrared cameras and even lighting controls can all run on the same communication protocol.\n\nIn the U.S., Project Green Light Detroit similarly uses open architecture and seamless collaboration between public and private entities. The Detroit Police Department initiated the project in 2016, partnering with eight gas stations equipped with real-time camera connections to police headquarters. The innovative public-private community partnership enhances neighborhood safety, supports local businesses and strengthens crime prevention efforts.\n\nOver the years, participants have installed high-definition cameras, upgraded network connections and improved lighting on their properties. The police department and the city provide staff to monitor and analyze video feeds in the real-time crime center.\n\nLEARN MORE: Moving physical security to the cloud boosts efficiency.\n\nSharing Resources Yields a Reduced Environmental Impact\n\nAnother key benefit of open architecture systems is that they allow multiple agencies to share surveillance infrastructure and data, reducing the need for each entity to deploy its own hardware. This collaborative approach can decrease the environmental impact associated with manufacturing, operating and disposing of electronic surveillance equipment. Open architecture systems also allow for the use of cloud-based services and more efficient data centers, which consume less energy compared with traditional, decentralized systems.\n\nOpen architecture systems are also inherently flexible and scalable, allowing for easier updates and integration of new technologies without complete system overhauls. For example, you can add features such as network speakers to improve communication and even provide verbal warnings to deter certain behaviors. Network intercoms can provide audiovisual identification and remote entry control.\n\nOther examples might include body-worn solutions for private security and law enforcement, analytics to improve operator efficiency, radar to follow intruders, and even strobe sirens for safety and deterrence.\n\nLater expansion of the systems would make it possible to extend the lifespan of existing infrastructure while reducing waste and demand for new materials.\n\nDIVE DEEPER: State and local governments can build data centers sustainably.\n\nCost Sharing Minimizes Expenditures\n\nThe collaborative nature of open architecture surveillance allows for cost sharing among participating units, government agencies and organizations. This can include shared expenses for acquisition, maintenance and upgrades. The net results of cost sharing include significant savings and more efficient use of public funds.\n\nAgencies and entities that buy in will ultimately experience a higher ROI. They can integrate and upgrade systems as needed without replacing entire setups, which helps ensure that investments remain valuable over a longer period, further contributing to economic sustainability.\n\nIn the end, public agencies and law enforcement can optimize their use of available resources through the sharing of surveillance data and open architecture systems. This leads to more efficient deployment of personnel and equipment, further reducing unnecessary expenditures and environmental impact.\n\nAdhering to Privacy and Data Protection Requirements\n\nWhile the benefits are substantial, the implementation of open architecture surveillance systems is not without challenges; in particular, privacy, data protection and cybersecurity need to be placed front and center to safeguard all data in transit among agencies and other entities, and at rest.\n\nNevertheless, the transition to open architecture surveillance systems represents a forward-thinking approach to public sector operations and safety. By overcoming the limitations of siloed, proprietary systems, agencies can enhance their collaborative efforts, operational efficiency and, ultimately, their service to the community.\n\nWith that in mind, this transition requires a commitment to technological innovation, but the principles of privacy, security and ethical governance must remain priorities. As we move forward, the main goal should remain leveraging technology to serve the public good, ensuring safer, more secure and united cities and towns.\n\nUP NEXT: Cybersecurity mesh strengthens security for state and local governments."

            "article_content": "Nobody expected anything special when the squadron of Navy F/A-18 fighter jets headed out for routine aerial maneuvers off of the coast of Virginia Beach one day in 2013. The F/A-18s, a Naval workhorse, owned the local air space that day\u2014but only until they didn\u2019t.\n\nAll at once, the jets\u2019 radar picked up a cluster of half a dozen objects flying along with them, moving erratically\u2014and entirely acrobatically. At some moments they ripped along side-to-side at speeds exceeding 350 knots\u2014or 402 mph. Then, suddenly, they would stand utterly still in winds that themselves were moving at 150 knots (172 mph)\u2014gusts that had the jets struggling to maintain position. Then the objects would accelerate again. They had no visible exhaust, no discernible means of propulsion, and indeed looked nothing like any aircraft in the nation\u2019s civilian or military arsenal.\n\nMeasuring five to 15 ft. across, they were a \u201cdark gray or black cube inside a clear sphere,\u201d former Navy Lieutenant Ryan Graves, who was aloft that day, tells TIME. \u201cWe almost hit one of the objects; they came within 50 ft. of the lead aircraft, and that's really when we knew we were dealing with something a bit abnormal here. There's no aircraft in our inventory I'm aware of that has the ability to operate at very low speeds, or no speeds, and then accelerate and operate like a fighter.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the last time the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP)\u2014the genteel, modern-day term for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO)\u2014harrassed the Navy. \u201cWe saw them in Virginia Beach between 2013 and 2015,\u201d says Graves. \u201cLater, when we executed training operations aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt off the coast of Jacksonville, Fla., they were either already down there or they had followed us down, because we had over a dozen incidents, two of which were recorded [by the Navy] and released by The New York Times in 2017.\u201d\n\nThose videos, known popularly as \u201cthe Gimbal,\u201d after the objects\u2019 pinwheeling motion, are just part of the eyewitness visuals featured in the new PBS NOVA documentary \u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d premiering on PBS stations on Jan. 22. And Graves is just one of the many people who have borne witness to them who offers his accounts. The documentary traces the arc of UFOs and UAPs in American skies, from June 24, 1947, when aviator and businessman Kenneth Arnold reported the first widely publicized sightings of flying saucers, to the present, when accounts of UAPs have exploded, with 801 reported to the military since 2023 alone. Within the Pentagon\u2019s $65 billion \u201cblack budget\u201d of classified expenditures, an estimated $22 million has reportedly been spent on its Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which investigates UAPs.\n\nEven before that contemporary program, the U.S. military was keenly interested in the provenance of UFOs and UAPs, as the NOVA film documents. From 1947 to 1969, the Air Force ran a secret\u2014though since declassified\u2014program dubbed Project Blue Book, which investigated 12,618 sightings of flying objects. Of these, 701 remain unidentified. Some of the earliest reports, from 1947 to 1949, were sightings of military assets that were part of the Department of Defense\u2019s Project Mogul, under which the Air Force lofted high altitude balloons carrying sensitive microphones designed to pick up sonic signatures of Soviet nuclear tests. The initial rumors of extraterrestrial doings at Roswell, N.M. stemmed from a local rancher collecting debris from a balloon that descended on his land.\n\nIn the 21st century there is a lot more airborne traffic giving rise to a lot more potential false UAP alarms. More than 1,800 weather balloons are launched worldwide everyday, according to the NOVA documentary, and the Federal Aviation Administration reports that over one million registered drones are in private hands in the U.S. Plenty of what is reputed to be aliens likely has a perfectly banal terrestrial explanation. But sightings like the gimbal are a lot harder to explain away\u2014a point proven by another UAP incident known colloquially as the Tic Tac.\n\nIn 2004, the U.S.S. Nimitz Carrier strike group off the coast of southern California picked up repeated radar reflections of flying objects that would rapidly appear and disappear from tracking screens. During those intervals when they were visible, they would fly in a looping, diving, and skittering path, rapidly dropping from 80,000 ft. to 20,000 ft. and hovering there. Finally, Naval pilot David Fravor and others were sent aloft to investigate and found their quarry\u2014a 45-ft. long flying machine that for all the world resembled in both color and shape a Tic Tac breath mint.\n\n\u201cAll four of us looked down and saw a Tic Tac object with a longitudinal axis pointed north-south and moving very abruptly over the water, like a ping pong ball,\u201d said Fravor in 2023 testimony before Congress. \u201cThere were no rotors, no rotor wash, or any sign of visible control surfaces like wings. The object suddenly shifted its longitudinal axis, aligned it with my aircraft and began to climb. As we pulled nose onto the object within about a half mile of it, it rapidly accelerated and disappeared.\u201d\n\nVideo of the encounter was released by the Navy which has never offered a theory as to what it was.\n\nLike the Tic Tac and the Gimbal, the hundreds of other unexplained UAPs continue to flummox experts. Graves is now executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, a nonprofit that collects sightings of UAPs with an eye toward helping to shape the public conversation around unidentified objects and deconflict airspace. He does not pretend to know what the bogeys are\u2014but he\u2019s pretty sure what they\u2019re not.\n\n\u201cI don't think that we're seeing an adversary demonstrating capability beyond our state of the art during these relatively low reward, high risk operations,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be able to take these technologies that we're not aware exist and to put them basically directly over our homeland, in a position to be captured and reverse engineered\u2026I don't see that. I don't see that logic.\u201d\n\nEqually unlikely is that the craft are highly classified domestic technology that much of the military has not been tipped off about. \u201cThese were airborne assets that were exhibiting capabilities beyond our state of the art,\u201d Graves says. \u201cAnd what I mean by state of the art is technology that would take greater than 10 years for the U.S. to develop, if they started now.\u201d\n\nThat leaves non-earthly origins and Graves, for one, does not speculate on that score. \u201cI don't think we have the proper definitions to go down that road,\u201d he says, \u201cwithout having a better way of defining how we would determine whether something is truly from another star system\u2026[whether] these objects are using magical physics that we don't understand.\u201d\n\nThe NOVA film does offer other explanations. Conspiracy debunker Mick West, author of Escaping the Rabbit Hole, theorizes that it\u2019s not the object in the gimbal video that\u2019s doing the moving but the camera that captured the image, creating merely the illusion of motion\u2014though that doesn\u2019t explain what the object, which would be stationary in this case, actually is. In another\u2014infrared\u2014video in which the object appears to disappear and reappear, West suggests that the camera might be capturing the image of a bird that reached thermal equilibrium with the background temperature and thus simply seemed to vanish.\n\nThe filmmakers leave viewers with pretty much as many questions as they greet them with\u2014which fairly matches the state of the UAP art. With up to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way and an estimated 200 billion galaxies in the universe, there are uncounted trillions of planets that could host a highly technological civilization. Whether one of those civilizations would send any of their flying machines to our lonely world\u2014and why they\u2019d bother\u2014is impossible to say. But the sightings keep coming\u2014even if the answers remain elusive."

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nOver a span of several days last week, multiple sightings of UFOs were made in the Fresno, California area with no explanation ever revealed. A couple of the UFO sightings were even reported to the local airport tower by pilots.\n\nThe first UFO sighting occurred early in the morning when a light was recorded in the sky by a news tower camera just after 4 a.m. Fox 26 News reported that \u201cthe light appeared to hover over downtown Fresno.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you see that object move at the clip it moves and it\u2019s hovering again,\u201d said Earl Grey Anderson from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), who reviewed the footage. \u201cThat one I would probably actually give an unknown classification to which is a UFO.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I thought was very interesting about the second video is the clip. It suddenly moves. I\u2019m not sure what distance we\u2019re looking at there. It wasn\u2019t light speed or anything like that but that was awfully fast. You\u2019ve got an interesting capture there somebody saw what I would technically call a UFO.\u201d\n\nThe day after the initial UFO sighting, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara captured video of another UFO in the time, this time in broad daylight.\n\nThree days later, during the afternoon, a private pilot radioed the Fresno airport tower with a report of something unidentified in the sky. A second pilot reported an object following him at 3,500 feet.\n\nTower: \u201cYou saw something over downtown at 3,500?\u201d Pilot: \u201cCorrect. It looked like a white object.\u201d Tower: \u201cHow long was this?\u201d Pilot: \u201cI just lost it right now.\u201d\n\nSeveral other people in the area also reported taking video of similar objects in the sky at the time. Jeanette Herrera of Fresno reported seeing it on back-to-back days, and it\u2019s not the first time she has seen UFOs over the city.\n\n\u201cI saw that one video of the orb and I was like\u2026 well, wait a second. I\u2019ve got good video of these things,\u201d said Herrera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve filmed that particular orb at least three or four times in the last two weeks,\u201d Herrera continued, \u201cIt almost does this like firework thing where it blows up and then reappears in a different area. So, it just does that constantly and then sometimes it won\u2019t. It\u2019ll just stay like a little solid looking orb.\u201d\n\nA Fresno police helicopter, which investigated the one of the pilot\u2019s reports, and efforts to reach the Federal Aviation Administration in Fresno both proved fruitless for providing an explanation for the mysterious UFO sightings."

And Graves is just one of the many people who have borne witness to them who offers his accounts. The documentary traces the arc of UFOs and UAPs in American skies, from June 24, 1947, when aviator and businessman Kenneth Arnold reported the first widely publicized sightings of flying saucers, to the present, when accounts of UAPs have exploded, with 801 reported to the military since 2023 alone. Within the Pentagon\u2019s $65 billion \u201cblack budget\u201d of classified expenditures, an estimated $22 million has reportedly been spent on its Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which investigates UAPs.\n\nEven before that contemporary program, the U.S. military was keenly interested in the provenance of UFOs and UAPs, as the NOVA film documents. From 1947 to 1969, the Air Force ran a secret\u2014though since declassified\u2014program dubbed Project Blue Book, which investigated 12,618 sightings of flying objects. Of these, 701 remain unidentified. Some of the earliest reports, from 1947 to 1949, were sightings of military assets that were part of the Department of Defense\u2019s Project Mogul, under which the Air Force lofted high altitude balloons carrying sensitive microphones designed to pick up sonic signatures of Soviet nuclear tests. The initial rumors of extraterrestrial doings at Roswell, N.M. stemmed from a local rancher collecting debris from a balloon that descended on his land.\n\nIn the 21st century there is a lot more airborne traffic giving rise to a lot more potential false UAP alarms. More than 1,800 weather balloons are launched worldwide everyday, according to the NOVA documentary, and the Federal Aviation Administration reports that over one million registered drones are in private hands in the U.S. Plenty of what is reputed to be aliens likely has a perfectly banal terrestrial explanation. But sightings like the gimbal are a lot harder to explain away\u2014a point proven by another UAP incident known colloquially as the Tic Tac.\n\nIn 2004, the U.S.S. Nimitz Carrier strike group off the coast of southern California picked up repeated radar reflections of flying objects that would rapidly appear and disappear from tracking screens. During those intervals when they were visible, they would fly in a looping, diving, and skittering path, rapidly dropping from 80,000 ft. to 20,000 ft. and hovering there. Finally, Naval pilot David Fravor and others were sent aloft to investigate and found their quarry\u2014a 45-ft. long flying machine that for all the world resembled in both color and shape a Tic Tac breath mint.\n\n\u201cAll four of us looked down and saw a Tic Tac object with a longitudinal axis pointed north-south and moving very abruptly over the water, like a ping pong ball,\u201d said Fravor in 2023 testimony before Congress. \u201cThere were no rotors, no rotor wash, or any sign of visible control surfaces like wings. The object suddenly shifted its longitudinal axis, aligned it with my aircraft and began to climb. As we pulled nose onto the object within about a half mile of it, it rapidly accelerated and disappeared.\u201d\n\nVideo of the encounter was released by the Navy which has never offered a theory as to what it was.\n\nLike the Tic Tac and the Gimbal, the hundreds of other unexplained UAPs continue to flummox experts. Graves is now executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, a nonprofit that collects sightings of UAPs with an eye toward helping to shape the public conversation around unidentified objects and deconflict airspace. He does not pretend to know what the bogeys are\u2014but he\u2019s pretty sure what they\u2019re not.\n\n\u201cI don't think that we're seeing an adversary demonstrating capability beyond our state of the art during these relatively low reward, high risk operations,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be able to take these technologies that we're not aware exist and to put them basically directly over our homeland, in a position to be captured and reverse engineered\u2026I don't see that. I don't see that logic.\u201d\n\nEqually unlikely is that the craft are highly classified domestic technology that much of the military has not been tipped off about. \u201cThese were airborne assets that were exhibiting capabilities beyond our state of the art,\u201d Graves says. \u201cAnd what I mean by state of the art is technology that would take greater than 10 years for the U.S. to develop, if they started now.\u201d\n\nThat leaves non-earthly origins and Graves, for one, does not speculate on that score. \u201cI don't think we have the proper definitions to go down that road,\u201d he says, \u201cwithout having a better way of defining how we would determine whether something is truly from another star system\u2026[whether] these objects are using magical physics that we don't understand.\u201d\n\nThe NOVA film does offer other explanations. Conspiracy debunker Mick West, author of Escaping the Rabbit Hole, theorizes that it\u2019s not the object in the gimbal video that\u2019s doing the moving but the camera that captured the image, creating merely the illusion of motion\u2014though that doesn\u2019t explain what the object, which would be stationary in this case, actually is. In another\u2014infrared\u2014video in which the object appears to disappear and reappear, West suggests that the camera might be capturing the image of a bird that reached thermal equilibrium with the background temperature and thus simply seemed to vanish.\n\nThe filmmakers leave viewers with pretty much as many questions as they greet them with\u2014which fairly matches the state of the UAP art. With up to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way and an estimated 200 billion galaxies in the universe, there are uncounted trillions of planets that could host a highly technological civilization. Whether one of those civilizations would send any of their flying machines to our lonely world\u2014and why they\u2019d bother\u2014is impossible to say. But the sightings keep coming\u2014even if the answers remain elusive."

However, certain diseases and medical conditions continue to receive less funding and attention compared to others.\n\nPatients with rare medical conditions and diseases are often part of a traditionally underserved population. However, \u201corphan drugs\u201d provide hope by offering treatment options that improve their quality of life and potentially extend life expectancy.\n\nImage Credit: unoL/Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat is an Orphan Drug?\n\n\u201cOrphan\u201d diseases affect small patient populations. In the US, to be considered an orphan disease, it must affect under 200,000 patients. Typically, funding for treatment can be difficult to come by, with only 600 \u201corphan\u201d drugs approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1\n\nThe term\u2019s origin can be found in the 1960s when Dr Harry Shirkey wrote an article called \u201cTherapeutic Orphans.\u201d Changes in legislation and regulation in that decade led to some drugs being \u201corphaned\u201d as they were no longer cost-effective for drug companies due to a lack of market demand. Thus, there has historically been little financial incentive for pharma companies to develop drugs to treat rare diseases.2\n\nMarket Report 2025: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing\n\nUnderstanding Rare Diseases\n\nWhilst a rare disease is defined as affecting under 200,000 patients in the US, the global patient population living with these types of disease is estimated at 3.5-5.9%. This is in the range of 263 to 446 million people worldwide.3\n\nRare diseases include well-known types of diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis, ALS, and hemophilia, as well as rarer types of cancers.\n\nMetabolism disorders, autoimmune diseases, autoinflammatory syndromes, cerebrovascular disorders, degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (a prion disease) all fall under the umbrella of rare diseases.\n\nThere are over 10,000 known medical diseases with a significant cumulative burden. Not only patients are affected, but family members and communities can feel the impact of these rare and hard-to-treat conditions.\n\n5 Myths About Orphan Drugs and the Orphan Drug Act Play\n\nThe Role of Orphan Drug Legislation\n\nAs explained above, the rarer a disease is, the less financial incentive there is for pharma companies to research and develop a drug to treat it. However, whether there is any financial incentive or not, patients still suffer the effects of these diseases.\n\nThe role of legislation has been critical for the development of drugs for these diseases. It would be the drafting of legislation such as the Orphan Drug Act (1983) in the US and the EU Regulation on orphan medicinal products that would make it easier for orphan drugs to come to market.4,5\n\nThe Orphan Drug Act (1983) incentivizes the development of orphan drugs by providing tax incentives, research subsidies, and exclusive marketing rights for companies for 7 years once an orphan drug comes to market. Since the act was introduced, over 880 orphan drugs have been approved for use by the FDA.4 Similarly, in the EU, over 200 orphan drugs have been authorized due to legislation.\n\nWhy are Orphan Drugs Important?\n\nAs can be seen, orphan drugs have been historically critically underfunded, and in some cases, even today, they can face financial pressures that limit their release onto the market. However, at the foundation of orphan drug research can be found the patients themselves and their unmet medical needs.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the inequalities and disparities across different patient populations and demographics, and this has parallels in the rare disease sector.\n\nThe UN has now recognized the importance of addressing these disparities, promoting greater integration of rare and orphan diseases into policies.3 The goals of rare disease research and universal health coverage targets share a commonality.\n\nOrphan drugs do not just improve the lives of those suffering from rare diseases, as mentioned previously in this article. Better funding and improved access to therapies also impact the families and communities of patients.\n\nThese drugs bring social and economic benefits; for example, relieving the symptoms of a rare disease can reduce care needs and burdens on family members.\n\nFurthermore, orphan drugs drive advancements in precision medicine and biotechnology. Innovation in this area can have a positive impact on related biomedical fields.\n\nChallenges in Developing Orphan Drugs\n\nThere are still several challenges with orphan drugs, although bringing them to market has been made easier by legislation.\n\nHigh development costs, limited financial returns, difficulty in conducting trials due to small patient populations, and the high price of orphan drugs are all roadblocks to their market adoption.\n\nHigh costs create access issues for patients and healthcare providers. Moreover, insurance companies may be less willing to cover the costs of orphan drugs due to the high costs and perceived lack of financial return associated with them.\n\nDrug Delivery: An Overview\n\nRecent Advances and Success Stories\n\nSince the introduction of legislation such as the Orphan Drug Act, there have been several success stories in the orphan drug and rare disease sector.\n\nIvalfactor and Kalydeco are drugs that treat Cystic Fibrosis, a debilitating condition that affects nearly 200,000 people worldwide. Spinraza is an orphan drug used to treat spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nCoagulation factor IX has been developed to prevent bleeding in hemophilia B patients. Rucaparib is a drug that was approved for ovarian cancer. Porphyria can be treated using Haem arginate.\n\nInnovations such as targeted therapies and gene therapy are accelerating research into rare diseases and orphan drugs. Personalized medicine is having an impact on areas such as orphan drug designation and pricing strategies.6\n\nThe Future of Orphan Drugs\n\nThe need for orphan drugs and therapeutics options for traditionally underserved patient populations has driven legislation and cooperation between governments, pharma companies, and patient advocacy groups in recent years.\n\nThis is likely to continue over the coming years and will continue to impact health outcomes for millions of patients worldwide.\n\nFurthermore, innovations in areas such as AI-powered drug discovery, machine learning, synthetic biology, and genomics are accelerating orphan drug development.\n\nThe emerging role of AI, for instance, is a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical research, improving the speed of drug target discovery exponentially. Novel molecules can be designed, and patient response markers can be better identified.\n\nSynthetic biology can help target identification. Novel biopharmaceuticals can be designed using these innovations. This can only benefit the development of orphan drugs for rare disease treatment in the future.\n\nIn Summary\n\nMillions of patients worldwide suffer from rare diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cancers, neurological disorders, and autoimmune diseases.\n\nOrphan drugs offer hope to these historically underserved patient populations, but a lack of funding and research focus makes releasing them to market problematic.\n\nHowever, legislation, innovation, and increasing collaboration between multiple stakeholders, including patient advocacy groups, have resulted in more orphan drugs being approved in recent years, improving patients' quality of life and health outcomes.\n\nFurther innovation and continued focus on advocacy for orphan drugs will be necessary to build on this global medical success story.\n\nReferencing\n\nChao, S (2024) What is an Orphan Drug?
