            "article_content": "If 2024 is going to be remembered for anything, it likely will be remembered as the first year that generative AI took hold of the cultural zeitgeist. It seemed everywhere you looked, you saw something about AI. At Google, the company went all-in on AI, injecting its Gemini systems into pretty much every product and service it offers.\n\nAs it turns out, this also applies to its security teams. The Google Play security team, for example, just released its annual report on what\u2019s been happening behind the scenes as they protect us all from harmful apps, bad developers, malware, and other issues. In 2024, this team stopped more bad apps than any other year prior \u2014 2.36 million apps, to be precise, which is wild to even think about. Google says that AI played a considerable role here.\n\nAccording to Google, human app reviewers on the Google Play security team used AI in their work in 92% of cases. That\u2019s a massive amount. Google claims AI tools help the team act more quickly and take more accurate action against developers who are trying to sneak bad apps onto the Play Store.\n\nThe Google Play security team is not the only way we are protected from bad apps, though. In 2024, Google also introduced a bunch of new security features to its Play Protect service that prevent attackers that do get through its defenses from doing any significant harm to you. Here are three examples:\n\nReminder to turn on Play Protect: The Play Protect service on Android phones scans all apps \u2014 whether they come from Google Play or the wider internet \u2014 for viruses, malware, and other attacks. Sometimes, user turn this feature off so that they can install something they know to be safe. To help prevent attacks during this Play Protect downtime, Chrome now reminds users to turn Play Protect back on if it has been turned off.\n\nThe Play Protect service on Android phones scans all apps \u2014 whether they come from Google Play or the wider internet \u2014 for viruses, malware, and other attacks.

To help prevent attacks during this Play Protect downtime, Chrome now reminds users to turn Play Protect back on if it has been turned off. Disabling Play Protect toggle during calls: One method attackers use to exploit Android users is to call them and ask them to turn Play Protect off during the call. To combat this, Android now disables the Play Protect toggle during both regular calls as well as voice calls through popular chat apps. In order to toggle Play Protect off, you would need to end the call first, which will hopefully be enough time for the user to figure out that that\u2019s not a great idea.\n\nOne method attackers use to exploit Android users is to call them and ask them to turn Play Protect off during the call.

Automatic permissions revoking: When you install and use an app, you sometimes need to grant it permissions. Sometimes, the app you\u2019ve installed is malicious, and the permissions you\u2019ve granted it put you in danger. Now, Play Protect automatically revokes permissions for apps like these. The user can still manually restore those permissions if they want to, but once again, this will give that malicious app less of an opening to do any damage.\n\nConsidering how many Android devices are out there (over two billion) and how open the Android ecosystem is compared to other operating systems, it\u2019s a wonder it isn\u2019t completely overrun with bad actors. Many people reading this have likely never faced a significant security problem on their Android device, which is a direct result of what the Google Play security team does every day."

So, that's the coolest part about this building specifically.\"\n\nThe crew even attempts to contact one specific prisoner \u2014 Glenn \u2014 at the very spot he was murdered. \"Can you make this ball of light turn on?\" Bernstein asks, immediately resulting in a strange array of lights.\n\nWatch it all in Episode 11 directly below.\n\nREAD MORE: Inkcarceration Festival 2025 Full Daily Lineups Revealed\n\nAbout Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival and Danny Wimmer Presents\n\nInkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival is held each year at the historic Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield.\n\nConstruction began back in 1886 and the prison was operational from 1896 through 1990 and it was also used in a scene in the classic movie, The Shawshank Redemption. While the prison remains open to tourism, the most exciting moment of the year is certainly when the fest rolls into town for a long weekend of rock and metal.\n\nFans are already looking forward to the 2025 installment, which takes place July 18, 29 and 20 with headliners Falling in Reverse, Slipknot and Five Finger Death Punch.\n\nInkcarceration is one of many of Danny Wimmer Presents' premiere festivals.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s note: Welcome to the world of \u201cParanormal PA,\u201d a PennLive series that delves into Pennsylvania-grown stories of spirits; cryptids; oddities and legends; and the unexplained. Sign up here to get our Paranormal PA newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nBy all accounts, Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s life is pretty sweet.\n\nHe\u2019s immortal. He\u2019s got a great wife and kids. And his only job requirement is going outside once a year.\n\nBut before anyone poo-poos what many view as one of Pennsylvania\u2019s \u2014 or, indeed, the country\u2019s \u2014 more bizarre traditions, Paranormal Pa. will have you know that Phil is a product of a storied tradition (and superstition) that stretches back for years and years.\n\nGerman immigrants brought the tradition over when they settled in Pennsylvania hundreds of years ago. (AP Photo/Barry Reeger)AP\n\nThe Punsutawney Groundhog Club explains how the first time \u201cWeather Wags\u201d recognized Groundhog Day was in 1886, although the first official trek to Gobbler\u2019s Knob was the following year.\n\nBut the concept of having animals predict the weather goes way back before the 19th century. According to the Library of Congress Blogs, Groundhog Day\u2019s lineage can be traced back to ancient pre-Christian festivals celebrated by the Celts that served as midway points between equinoxes. Halloween \u2014 originally Samhain \u2014 falls into this category, too.\n\nFormerly known as \u201cImbolc\u201d before it eventually became the Christianized Candlemas, Groundhog Day was once considered the first day of spring. And while little is known about how the Celts celebrated the day, one traditional practice was attempting to divine the weather.\n\nNow, here\u2019s how animals figure into this: Ancient people used to observe animal behavior as part of their own farming practices, so the idea of watching how a groundhog to see whether or not spring was on its way makes sense.\n\nVisitPa.com adds how Roman legions, in their conquest of northern Europe, eventually spread the Candelmas Day tradition of candles being blessed and distributed. Those living in what\u2019s now Germany soon began to believe that if the sun made an appearance on the day, an animal who cast his shadow would predict six more weeks of cruddy weather.\n\nGroundhog Club President Tom Dunkel taps on the immortal groundhog's door so the weather oracle can make his prediction. (AP Photo/Barry Reeger)AP\n\nIn his book \u201cGroundhog Day (2003),\u201d Dan Yoder writes how the Germans who brought this tradition over to the U.S. used to watch badgers to see how far away spring was (the German folk expression for the holiday was \u201cDachstag,\u201d or \u201cBadger Day\u201d). Then somewhere along the line, that badger became a groundhog.\n\nNot to say that early Groundhog Day celebrations in Pennsylvania didn\u2019t maintain a bit of their mysticism: Yoder describes late 19th century celebrations of involving ritualized Groundhog Hunts in September which drew in \u201cdevotees from Pittsburgh and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nOne parade in 1909, as staged by the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, was deemed \u201cthe Circumgyratory Pageant of the Astrologers, Horoscopists, Magicians, Soothsayers, and Meteorological Attach\u00e9s of Punxsutawney Weather Works.\u201d A man named Clymer Freas \u2014 credited as conceiving of the idea for the holiday \u2014 even created \u201cGroundhogese,\u201d the language Groundhog Club presidents learn in order to discern the groundhog\u2019s annual predictions.\n\nThere may not be any more astrologists or soothsayers involved, but Groundhog Day remains a celebration: More than 30,000 people from across the globe drop by Knobbler\u2019s Creek on the day, getting up at the crack of dawn in the dead of winter to watch Phil make his prediction.\n\nTo be fair, though, even back in the day, people raised their eyebrows at the idea of watching a rodent predict how much longer winter would last.\n\n\u201cIn consequence, probably of having given all spiritual matters to the exclusive supervision of the clergy, newspaper editors are somewhat skeptical about many things which are popularly accepted with absolute faith,\u201d read an 1876 edition of the Harrisburg Daily Patriot.\n\n\u201cThis may account for the reason that some of them have failed to appreciate the sentiment\u2026in favor of a legal recognition of Ground Hog Day.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, editorial skepticism be damned, Groundhog Day won out, and did, indeed, spawn an industry. And inspired a Bill Murray movie. And tons of Punxsutawney wannabes like Staten Island Chuck, who did, it should be noted, tragically lost his life after former New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio quite literally fumbled him (never forget).\n\nYes, the holiday has come very far from its very old roots. And whether you\u2019re an eyebrow-raiser to the holiday or all-in, it doesn\u2019t look like Groundhog Day is going away any time soon.\n\nThat is, unless PETA has their way."

Now a new study claims to have discovered a massive reserve of hydrogen beneath the earth surface which could power the planet for decades and centuries to come. The research shows that earth may be holding trillions of tons of hydrogen reserves which could power the planet for centuries to come.\n\nAccording to a geological survey by Geoffrey Ellis of US, the hydrogen reverse beneath the earth surface could power the earth for the next 1,000 years and reduce world\u2019s dependency on the fossil fuels.\n\nThe research further says that the earth\u2019s surface could be holding up an estimated 6.2 trillion tons of Hydrogen, which is also considered as one of the low-carbon source of energy.\n\nWhat's the challenge?\n\nThe discovery of Hydrogen reserves is not new to the world as they have already been identified in Albania and Mali.\n\nHowever, the latest research claiming on the existence of hydrogen are believed to be too deep beneath the surface, and will become a very tough challenge for its excavation.\n\nThe study further says that even just 2 per cent utilisation of this hydrogen will meet our energy demand for the next 2 centuries \u2013 200 years \u2013 and that too as a low carbon source.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, an expert from University College London has said that the extraction of hydrogen from beneath will be a huge challenge for the world and something which would require a joint effort."

It is the subject of multiple lawsuits along those lines, including from The New York Times, which claims the company built its model in part by ingesting millions of the newspaper\u2019s stories without permission.\n\nOn Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted a congratulations to DeepSeek on X, saying it had developed \u201can impressive model, particularly around what they\u2019re able to deliver for the price.\u201d\n\nThe OpenAI spokesperson indicated the White House may get involved in the dispute.\n\n\u201cWe take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the U.S. government to protect the most capable models being built here,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump\u2019s AI adviser, David Sacks, told Fox News that he believed DeepSeek did distill from OpenAI, but stopped short of declaring that the White House would take action.\n\n\u201cI think one of the things you\u2019re going to see over the next few months is our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would definitely slow down some of these copycat models.\u201d\n\nBrian Hughes, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in an email to NBC News that the White House was looking into the broader issue but didn't specifically address OpenAI's distillation accusation.\n\n\u201cAt the President\u2019s direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government are working in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security. As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\u201d"

The company says these smarter Gemini features are targeted toward small business owners, marketers, or anyone else working with a lot of data in Google Sheets.\n\nSpecifically, Gemini in Sheets can now spot \"contextual trends, patterns, and correlations between different variables in your data\" when you ask it questions via the sidebar. From there, it can create charts from your data automatically when requested. You can insert those charts as images in your Google Sheets document, or use them elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough these features might seem simple, Gemini is doing some impressive work behind the scenes. For complex queries, Gemini is actually converting your written entries into Python code, executing the code, and drawing conclusions based on the result. This is how Gemini in Sheets can now provide multilayered analysis, according to Google.\n\nSimpler Gemini requests might leverage Sheets formulas instead of Python code, but the latter will help for larger and more complex needs. For instance, Google says Gemini in Sheets performs consistently in documents up to one million cells in size.\n\nCredit: Google\n\nTo get the best results, make sure your Gemini prompts are clear and specific. In your document, use consistent formats and organization techniques, like clear headers and complete values. Remember that since graphs generated with Gemini are static images, they won't update when you update your cells. Instead, you'll need to generate a new graph when updating a document's contents.\n\nThese features are available starting today for paid Gemini in Workspace customers. That includes Business Standard and Plus users, Enterprise Standard and Plus users, customers with the Gemini Education or Gemini Education Premium add-ons, or Google One AI Premium subscribers. Legacy purchasers of Gemini Business and Enterprise will also get the Gemini in Sheets features.\n\nGoogle is using an extended rollout for these tools for both rapid and scheduled release Workspace domains. You'll start seeing these tools as of today, Jan. 29, 2025, but some users and domains may have to wait until Feb. 20, 2025 for completion."

            "article_content": "Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Google has announced new features for Gemini in Google Sheets, aimed at making data analysis easier.\n\nGemini can now generate charts, analyze trends, and answer data-related questions, even running Python code for deeper insights.\n\nThese features are rolling out now and will be available to select Google Workspace and Google One AI Premium subscribers.\n\nIf spreadsheets have ever left you squinting at rows of data or scrambling to build charts, Gemini\u2019s latest update might be a welcome relief. The company announced today that its Gemini AI assistant, already embedded in Google Workspace apps, is learning some new tricks for Google Sheets.\n\nStarting today, Gemini in Sheets can process user queries to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within spreadsheet data. This means users can ask questions about their data and receive actionable insights without needing advanced technical skills. For example, a marketing analyst could request insights into their top-performing channels, while a financial analyst could use Gemini to detect anomalies in inventory levels.\n\nAnother major addition is Gemini\u2019s ability to generate charts based on spreadsheet data. These charts, inserted as static images, provide a visual representation of key insights but do not automatically update when the data changes.\n\nGemini in Sheets can now also translate user requests into Python code, execute that code, and analyze the results. This would allow for more complex data analysis, enabling users to identify trends and drill deeper into their findings \u2014 all without needing to write a single line of Python themselves. However, for simpler queries, Gemini may still rely on spreadsheet formulas instead of Python.\n\nTo ensure the best results, Google recommends that users maintain a clean and well-structured dataset, free of missing values, with clear headers. Additionally, Sheets with more than one million cells may experience performance limitations when using Gemini for complex analysis.\n\nThe new features are rolling out starting today, with a full rollout expected by February 20. For those eager to test out the new features, Gemini in Sheets can be accessed through the side panel in Google Sheets by clicking on the \u201cAsk Gemini\u201d button in the top-right corner.\n\nHowever, not all users will have immediate access. Gemini\u2019s expanded capabilities in Sheets will be available to subscribers of Google Workspace Business Standard and Plus, Enterprise Standard and Plus, as well as users with the Gemini Education, Gemini Education Premium, or Google One AI Premium add-ons.\n\nGot a tip?

The speculation surrounding whether the forthcoming Apple iPhone SE 4 will have a notch at the top of its screen, or adopt the Dynamic Island format introduced on the Apple iPhone 14 series, has reached such a ridiculous point, I no longer want to hear about it until the phone is officially revealed.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about it.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWill it or won\u2019t it?\n\nWhat has got me to breaking point? It\u2019s the repeated flip-flopping. One day a report comes out saying the phone will have a notch, and the next there\u2019s another report claiming it\u2019ll have the Dynamic Island. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if it was just two reports spaced by weeks or even months, but instead, it\u2019s multiple reports coming in the space of days, and over a long period of time.\n\nBased on what has been reported to me, the iPhone SE could have a design very similar to that of the current iPhone 16 still in development. The new iPhone SE will most likely have a single camera instead of the double one of the iPhone 16 models, otherwise it seems that the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Z1Gio4nBRu \u2014 Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) February 8, 2024\n\nLet me illustrate it for you. It all traces back to February 2024, when the 4th generation iPhone SE was linked with the iPhone 16\u2019s shape and with the iPhone XR\u2019s dimensions, and the claim was that it would include a pill-shape cutout for the Dynamic Island at the top of the screen. Fast forward to January 28, 2025, after a whole lot of speculation on both sides of the fence, and we\u2019re told the iPhone SE 4 will have a notch.\n\nNotch like iPhone 14 is correct \u2014 Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) January 28, 2025\n\nOver a year we\u2019ve seen multiple conflicting reports and various images and videos, each not really confirming the situation one way or the other, but appearing adamant their conclusion was the correct one. Once 2025 hit, talk of the notch and Dynamic Island reached fever pitch, with snippets of code apparently showing the Dynamic Island, and the source of the original rumor that started it all now saying the phone will have a notch. I know this is how the rumor mill works, but rarely is there such division.\n\nTrusted sources\n\nIt\u2019s not like the reports are solely coming from anonymous sources, or can be marked down as idle speculation by fans. Most come from trusted industry watchers, known insiders, or individuals in the business of leaking details about unreleased devices, and with a good track record for accuracy. This makes it all even more infuriating because I\u2019d usually trust these sources, yet something is clearly amiss here.\n\nNew iPhone models are always hotly anticipated, but the iPhone SE 4 seems to have risen above Apple\u2019s previous SE models in terms of the buzz around it, and it\u2019s surprising to see most of the talk centered on one aspect, and the opinions so opposite. What\u2019s got phone pundits so sweaty and eager to chime in? The Dynamic Island is a delightful way to add functionality to the necessary cutout at the top of the screen and would be a big update for the SE line. However, it\u2019s not what I\u2019d call transformative, and if it wasn\u2019t there I doubt I\u2019d really miss it.\n\nThe notch looks old and has been controversial ever since it made its first appearance on the Essential Phone in 2017 and subsequently on the iPhone X in the same year. Few like the design, a lot hate the design, but most just tolerate it. Today it can be seen as an outdated way of dealing with the multiple cameras and sensors required on the front of our phones, and not an especially attractive one. No one wants the notch, but many expect the notch.\n\nSomeone is wrong\n\nWhat all this means is that the situation could go either way, and that\u2019s the impression we\u2019ve been given by the endless speculation over the last 12 months too. It also means someone out there is wrong.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4, or iPhone 16E depending on what Apple decides to call its next budget model, either has a notch or the Dynamic Island. It can\u2019t have both. Or can it? The Dynamic Island is really a hardware and software solution, enlarging the usable space around the pill-shaped cutout at the top of the iPhone\u2019s screen for features like Live Activities. A notch shapes the screen around a cutout at the top of the device, and the software ignores it entirely. Apple could adapt the Dynamic Island for use with a notch, if the SE 4 ends up using one, technically making everyone right.\n\nThough possible, it\u2019s probably unlikely. We must remember the iPhone SE 4 is Apple\u2019s budget device, and compromises have to be made to keep the cost down. Using up supplies of notched screens would be one way to do it. On the other hand, the Dynamic Island would bring the iPhone SE 4 in-line with the iPhone 16\u2019s design (and presumably, the iPhone 17, but the Dynamic Island seems to be clouding that model too), and adapting the notch to include some of the Dynamic Island\u2019s functionality in iOS would give the SE 4 a \u201cmodern\u201d feature to increase value.\n\nNothing suggesting the iPhone SE 4\u2019s screen will do any of this has been seen in code for beta versions of iOS though, so it\u2019s just speculation on my part.\n\nThe judge rules\n\nThe fact I\u2019m adding my own speculation to the speculation, which can\u2019t agree on the situation anyway, only makes me more angry about the whole thing. The will-it, won\u2019t-it back-and-forth about the iPhone SE 4\u2019s screen has reached the point where nothing new should be added to the conversation unless it has conclusive proof to back it up.\n\nWhether that\u2019s a leaked image of the actual device and not a render or mockup based on code, or Apple officially revealing it during an event, it doesn\u2019t matter. No more speculation, please. We\u2019ve seen and heard the arguments from both sides and now all that\u2019s left is for the judge to rule. I\u2019m the judge here, and I\u2019m throwing the whole thing out because the entire case is based on hearsay.\n\nI don\u2019t care what the iPhone SE 4\u2019s screen looks like anymore, or if it will feature the Dynamic Island or not, and I won\u2019t until Apple shows me."

We talked to local experts who mentioned everything from color to dining experiences as this season\u2019s trends, where couples revoke the traditional and instead prioritize the intentional.\n\nColor, Color, Color\n\nMinimalism is out, and bold, textured color that reflects a couple\u2019s personality is in. Textiles and fabrics can truly help liven up a space, and that\u2019s exactly what professionals in the wedding industry are expecting to see more of in 2025. Think less neutral, more personal, says Over the Moon Events & Experiences owner and creative director Krysta Stoddard. \u201cThere\u2019s so much freedom, design wise, when you start working with different elements and colors,\u201d she says. That can be anything from eccentric tablescapes covered in a dramatic textile to draping in uncommon colors and fabrics.\n\nDramatic Drapes\n\nAny space can be immediately transformed with draping, but a single sheath of chiffon isn\u2019t going to cut it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be steering away from the white and blushes, and instead people are getting adventurous and using more color,\u201d says Cristina Bentley, VP director of operations at Bella Vista Designs. \u201cAnd draping plays a huge part in that.\u201d Imagine an extra layer of elegance, where yards of deep green velvet or vibrant patterns help transform spaces into something lush and luxurious.\n\nBella Vista Designs, a premier production company that just celebrated 20 years in business, has been doing draping since day one. \u201cA trend that we\u2019re seeing with draping is a lot of asymmetries \u2014 so it\u2019s not just a flat wall \u2026 [but] very eclectic layers on top of layers,\u201d says Bentley.\n\nDrapery drama by Bella Vista Designs | Credit: James and Jess Photography\n\nIntentional Design\n\nThis year, with color playing a huge factor in design, there\u2019s a shift from traditional to personal. That\u2019s reflected in nontraditional color palettes, but also in every element throughout the event; people are not just going to offer gifts because they\u2019ve been told to. Instead, says Tyler Speier of Tyler Speier Events, couples are requesting \u201creally intentional pieces that tell a story.\u201d\n\nThose high-touch elements can appear in the form of elaborate lighting like huge lantern or globe installations, or custom dance floors that tie the whole space together. \u201cI think people are going to start getting really creative with their dance floors,\u201d says Stoddard. Vendors like RCD Dance Floors can incorporate a monogram or introduce a vinyl overlay that matches a color or floral scheme to transform the space.\n\nDress Codes\n\nGone are the days where guests just show up for the ceremony, a meal, and maybe a dance. Couples are planning weekend-long celebrations for everyone; think coordinated hikes, yoga retreats, and wine tastings. With fewer and fewer couples asking friends and family to be part of the \u201cofficial\u201d wedding party, says Stoddard, dress codes and color palettes for three days of activities means everyone is part of the wedding. \u201cNot only is the bride, groom, or anyone in the bridal party going to make some fashion statement, but I think people are going to start giving mood boards or dress codes to their guests,\u201d she says.\n\nInteractive Experiences\n\nFor much of the population getting hitched, they\u2019ve placed a particular emphasis on experience. Couples are vying for grabbing guests\u2019 attention in a world of ephemeral design, which translates to more interactive wedding experiences. \u201cThe focus is so much on the experience,\u201d says Speier, that everything down to the smells, sounds, and tastes is being curated.\n\nTraditionally, says Speier, the festivities centered around the dance floor at the reception. Today, weddings are steering more toward \u201csexier, elevated dinner parties,\u201d he says, which translates to separate rooms for cocktail hour, dancing, and dinner \u2014 each with its own \u201cwow moment.\u201d That experiential moment can come in the shape of a poet with a vintage typewriter coming to cocktail hour or custom scent bars or upscale taco bars like Nomada or oyster bars where chefs shuck.\n\nContent Creators\n\nAs we mentioned last year, industry experts expect the demand for content creators to rise. In line with the desire to create a \u201cfeeling,\u201d on-site content creators can give couples something others can\u2019t: real-time content. Capturing the real-life moments allows for everyone to put down their phones and be more present \u2014 a feeling that will enhance the overall guest experience."

            "article_content": "The earth has been for long remained dependent on coal as a major source of energy before scientists discovered various different resources including thermal, solar, biomass or later nuclear energy. Now a new study claims to have discovered a massive reserve of hydrogen beneath the earth surface which could power the planet for decades and centuries to come. The research shows that earth may be holding trillions of tons of hydrogen reserves which could power the planet for centuries to come.\n\nAccording to a geological survey by Geoffrey Ellis of US, the hydrogen reverse beneath the earth surface could power the earth for the next 1,000 years and reduce world\u2019s dependency on the fossil fuels.\n\nThe research further says that the earth\u2019s surface could be holding up an estimated 6.2 trillion tons of Hydrogen, which is also considered as one of the low-carbon source of energy.\n\nWhat's the challenge?\n\nThe discovery of Hydrogen reserves is not new to the world as they have already been identified in Albania and Mali.\n\nHowever, the latest research claiming on the existence of hydrogen are believed to be too deep beneath the surface, and will become a very tough challenge for its excavation.\n\nThe study further says that even just 2 per cent utilisation of this hydrogen will meet our energy demand for the next 2 centuries \u2013 200 years \u2013 and that too as a low carbon source.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, an expert from University College London has said that the extraction of hydrogen from beneath will be a huge challenge for the world and something which would require a joint effort."

Having a managed service provider can help by being proactive in providing alerts on upcoming compliance and licensing changes,\u201d Desai says.\n\n\u201cThat was important for us, making sure we are not behind the curve and mitigating instead of being proactive. The \u2018how\u2019 was through constant reporting, proper reporting. When the time came for a compliance audit, I didn\u2019t have to ask my team. We had the reports already, due to our regular quarterly interaction with our MSPs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt allowed me to use our internal resources for purposes other than managing software licensing complexity.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Application rationalization can reduce application sprawl.\n\nSoftware Licensing Benefits from Centralized Effort\n\nA centralized approach to software licensing helps, giving IT leaders visibility into and control over the licensing landscape.\n\n\u201cYou have to manage your software assets in a central place,\u201d Gardner says. \u201cWe use ServiceNow and Flexera: They give us visibility and allow us to control the licensing, to have a better understanding of it.\u201d\n\nTo ensure users are supported, and redundancy minimized, \u201cyou need a tool that you can use to scan the environment. You can use security tools, or you can use ServiceNow for discovery and learn that this machine has all of these applications, and this user doesn\u2019t use these applications,\u201d he says. \u201cServiceNow knows we have 15 of these Office365 licenses, and if we see this user isn\u2019t active on Office365, we can reclaim that license and repurpose it to somebody that needs it,\u201d\n\nGardner says it\u2019s important to track version changes in software to avoid buying more than you need.\n\n\u201cSoftware vendors often will call something by a different name each year. You can end up with five versions, and you\u2019re going to have to do some manual normalization \u2014 like, application A is really application B, because they changed the name,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that an agency won\u2019t need licenses for both, but it will need to know about those changes in order to adjust the licenses."

            "article_content": "Finding patterns and reducing noise in large, complex datasets generated by the gravitational wave-detecting LIGO facility just got easier, thanks to the work of scientists at the University of California, Riverside.\n\nThe UCR researchers presented a paper at a recent IEEE big-data workshop, demonstrating a new, unsupervised machine learning approach to find new patterns in the auxiliary channel data of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO. The technology is also potentially applicable to large scale particle accelerator experiments and large complex industrial systems.\n\nJonathan Richardson\n\nLIGO is a facility that detects gravitational waves \u2014 transient disturbances in the fabric of spacetime itself, generated by the acceleration of massive bodies. It was the first to detect such waves from merging black holes, confirming a key part of Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity. LIGO has two widely-separated 4-km-long interferometers \u2014 in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana \u2014 that work together to detect gravitational waves by employing high-power laser beams. The discoveries these detectors make offer a new way to observe the universe and address questions about the nature of black holes, cosmology, and the densest states of matter in the universe.\n\nEach of the two LIGO detectors records thousands of data streams, or channels, which make up the output of environmental sensors located at the detector sites.\n\n\u201cThe machine learning approach we developed in close collaboration with LIGO commissioners and stakeholders identifies patterns in data entirely on its own,\u201d said Jonathan Richardson, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy who leads the UCR LIGO group. \u201cWe find that it recovers the environmental \u2018states\u2019 known to the operators at the LIGO detector sites extremely well, with no human input at all. This opens the door to a powerful new experimental tool we can use to help localize noise couplings and directly guide future improvements to the detectors.\u201d\n\nRichardson explained that the LIGO detectors are extremely sensitive to any type of external disturbance. Ground motion and any type of vibrational motion \u2014 from the wind to ocean waves striking the coast of Greenland or the Pacific \u2014 can affect the sensitivity of the experiment and the data quality, resulting in \u201cglitches\u201d or periods of increased noise bursts, he said.\n\n\u201cMonitoring the environmental conditions is continuously done at the sites,\u201d he said. \u201cLIGO has more than 100,000 auxiliary channels with seismometers and accelerometers sensing the environment where the interferometers are located. The tool we developed can identify different environmental states of interest, such as earthquakes, microseisms, and anthropogenic noise, across a number of carefully selected and curated sensing channels.\u201d\n\nVagelis Papalexakis, an associate professor of computer science and engineering who holds the Ross Family Chair in Computer Science, presented the team\u2019s paper, titled \u201cMultivariate Time Series Clustering for Environmental State Characterization of Ground-Based Gravitational-Wave Detectors,\u201d at the IEEE's 5th International Workshop on Big Data & AI Tools, Models, and Use Cases for Innovative Scientific Discovery that took place last month in Washington, D.C.\n\nVagelis Papalexakis is seen here at the Livingston site.\n\n\u201cThe way our machine learning approach works is that we take a model tasked with identifying patterns in a dataset and we let the model find patterns on its own,\u201d Papalexakis said. \u201cThe tool was able to identify the same patterns that very closely correspond to the physically meaningful environmental states that are already known to human operators and commissioners at the LIGO sites.\u201d\n\nPapalexakis added that the team had worked with the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to secure the release of a very large dataset that pertains to the analysis reported in the research paper. This data release allows the research community to not only validate the team\u2019s results but also develop new algorithms that seek to identify patterns in the data.\n\n\u201cWe have identified a fascinating link between external environmental noise and the presence of certain types of glitches that corrupt the quality of the data,\u201d Papalexakis said. \u201cThis discovery has the potential to help eliminate or prevent the occurrence of such noise.\u201d\n\nThe team organized and worked through all the LIGO channels for about a year. Richardson noted that the data release was a major undertaking.\n\n\u201cOur team spearheaded this release on behalf of the whole LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which has about 3,200 members,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first of these particular types of datasets and we think it\u2019s going to have a large impact in the machine learning and the computer science community.\u201d\n\nRichardson explained that the tool the team developed can take information from signals from numerous heterogeneous sensors that are measuring different disturbances around the LIGO sites. The tool can distill the information into a single state, he said, that can then be used to search for time series associations of when noise problems occurred in the LIGO detectors and correlate them with the sites\u2019 environmental states at those times.\n\nPooyan Goodarzi\n\n\u201cIf you can identify the patterns, you can make physical changes to the detector \u2014 replace components, for example,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hope is that our tool can shed light on physical noise coupling pathways that allow for actionable experimental changes to be made to the LIGO detectors. Our long-term goal is for this tool to be used to detect new associations and new forms of environmental states associated with unknown noise problems in the interferometers.\u201d\n\nPooyan Goodarzi, a doctoral student working with Richardson and a coauthor on the paper, emphasized the importance of releasing the dataset publicly.\n\n\u201cTypically, such data tend to be proprietary,\u201d he said. \u201cWe managed, nonetheless, to release a large-scale dataset that we hope results in more interdisciplinary research in data science and machine learning.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation awarded through a special program, Advancing Discovery with AI-Powered Tools, focused on applying artificial intelligence/machine learning to address problems in the physical sciences.\n\nRichardson, Papalexakis, and Goodarzi were joined in the research by Rutuja Gurav, a doctoral student working with Papalexakis; Isaac Kelly, a summer undergraduate REU student; Anamaria Effler of the LIGO Livingston Observatory; and Barry Barish, a UCR distinguished professor in physics and astronomy.\n\nHeader image shows LIGO Livingston, which is located in Livingston, Louisiana, and operates in tandem with LIGO Hanford.

            "article_content": "There are people in Britain today who currently deal with war-like situations. As a psychologist working in an NHS trauma service, I see the effects up close, in those who\u2019ve been caught up in disaster and in the emergency first responders sent to help them. My patients tell me traumatic experiences shift everything; those who come onto my radio show, Life Changing, say the same.\n\nSome traumatic experiences are one-offs, even if the effects last a lifetime. What, then, must it be like for those living through military conflict, day after day, month after month, year after year, with little or no respite? This is what is happening in Ukraine, where trauma is a daily reality and where stress and anxiety affect almost 80 per cent of people living there.\n\nImagine waking up every day not knowing if your home will still be standing by nightfall or whether the people you love will return \u2013 the anxiety of what might happen keeping you in a constant state of high alert.\n\nThere are the sights, sounds and smells of war, too: the constant blasts of air-raid sirens, the destruction of neighbourhoods, the smell of burning, and the regular power cuts. All of it creates a pervasive sense of fear and insecurity \u2013 a multisensory attack on minds and bodies.\n\nResearch suggests that prolonged exposure to stress in conflict zones can change the way the brain functions. The amygdala, the brain\u2019s fear centre, can become hyperactive, scanning for danger, like an alarm that\u2019s constantly ringing, quietening other important brain regions responsible for memory, decision-making and emotional regulation. It puts people in fight-flight-freeze mode, unable to switch off, or even to process what\u2019s happening effectively.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the brain that\u2019s affected. Ten years ago, Dutch psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk published a seminal best-selling book called The Body Keeps the Score. Its core message is that trauma leaves its mark not just on the mind but also on the body.\n\nOn a physical level, the body\u2019s stress response \u2013 including the release of cortisol and adrenalin \u2013 goes into overdrive. Over time, this leads to fatigue, sleep disturbances and a weakened immune system, raising the risk of other health conditions.\n\nDiane is a psychologist working for Humanity & Inclusion (HI) in Kharkiv in the north-east of Ukraine. She says the population has had to learn to adapt quickly. Practically, giving them instructions and safety rules provides them with a structure to help them navigate bombings and air alerts. Even so, she says, everyone is still living in a climate of uncertainty. It\u2019s hard to think about and build a future when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the next few seconds.\n\nHI\u2019s mental health team has identified various negative coping strategies that people are using, such as drinking more alcohol and taking medicines without a prescription; becoming cut off from others or having a negative attitude to life, and transferring negative emotions to friends and family."

            "article_content": "Analysts warn that stretched valuations and weakening credit cycles signal further downside risks.\n\nHeightened volatility, an FII sell-off, and tightening liquidity have caused the markets to enter a sharp corrective territory. However, the small- and mid-cap segment of the equities has taken a sharper fall compared to their large-cap peers, falling as much as 15 percent since the end of September.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe BSE400 small and midcap index is poised for its fifth 20 percent-plus correction post-GFC.\n\nIs this a blip or a bear market?\n\nHowever, is this fall a blip or a serious correction? According to analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities, this downturn could be the beginning of a bear market as domestic growth slows and durable liquidity slips into a deficit. Further, despite the 15 percent correction, SMID valuations are still high.\n\nThe past corrections can be classified as blips, such as those seen in 2015\u201316 and 2021\u201322 or bear markets, which was seen in 2011\u201313 and 2018\u201319.\n\nAs per Nuvama Institutional Equities, blips are short-lived, lasting two\u2013three quarters as SMIDs fall in line with large-caps. On the other hand, bear markets are prolonged correction phases with a 30\u201340 percent correction over two\u2013three years and large underperformance to the Nifty 50 and Sensex.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nDuring blips, all sectors decline, with little difference in sectoral performance. However, during bear markets cyclicals (real estate and industrials) tend to experience large underperformance and usually tend to correct by more than 50 percent.\n\nFurther, the brokerage noted that SMIDs are more exposed to the domestic economy than large-caps. Thus, it is only when domestic growth slackens do SMIDs tend to experience bear market and correct.\n\n\"The best way to assess the same is by looking at the domestic credit cycle and exports trend. If the credit cycle is weakening, then it is a sign of domestic weakness in which SMIDs will invariably underperform,\" said Nuvama analysts.\n\nBear markets are preceded by large 5Y returns (20 percent or above) while blips occur in the initial phases of bull markets and tend to have 10\u201315 percent 5Y returns in the run-up. Therefore, bear markets typically occur when domestic credit slows, liquidity tightens and midcaps experience a strong five-year rally on an absolute as well as relative basis.\n\nAlso Read | Budget cheer coming for railways? RVNL, Railtel, other rail stocks surge ahead of Budget 2025\n\nBlips on the other hand are an outcome of global weakness while domestic growth and liquidity conditions are generally stable. Furthermore, they are not preceded by a large medium-term rally.\n\nSo is this current correction a blip or bear market? Most signs point towards the SMIDs space entering a bear market. Domestic growth that is slackening this, which is evident in the credit cycle, while it was strong in 2023, in H1CY24 it has experienced a sharp moderation.\n\nAlso, excluding BFSI, SMID earnings are now underperforming large-cap peers and have moved into contraction. \"In fact, even in the Q3FY25 results season so far, SMID earnings have been disappointing and experienced large downgrades,\" noted the brokerage.\n\nThe performance of SMIDs relative to the Nifty 50 have been the highest in a post GFC-world. Even after the correction, they remain quite elevated \u2013 a trend that is typically observed in market corrections preceding bear markets.\n\nWith a sharp run up comes stretched valuations. Even, after the 15 percent correction, valuations are higher than the previous peaks.\n\nWay forward\n\nAs domestic growth is slackening, liquidity conditions are tightening and valuations as well as 5Y returns are quite elevated, Nuvama Institutional Equities believes there could be risks of a bear market. \"These have higher resemblance to the 2011\u201313 and 2018\u201319 phases. Thus, it is perhaps not yet a time to buy the dip,\" noted analysts.\n\nThe reversal from the previous bear markets, especially in 2018\u201319, was due to the US Federal Reserve. Hence, it is very important to monitor Fed actions and global liquidity hereon, as that will shape the SMIDs outcome.\n\nInvestors should maintain a very low beta bias as growth is still subdued and liquidity remains tight. \"In sectors, where margins are close to cyclical lows, and demand has stabilised, we think consolidation/costs focus could happen and those stocks/sectors could see larger upside,\" said Nuvama, adding, \"Despite the sharp correction, we recommend avoiding cyclical exposure in SMID portfolio.\"\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

            "article_content": "Once the dominant force in the Indian electric scooter segment, Ola Electric has lost significant market share to rival brands like Bajaj Chetak and TVS Motor. The Bengaluru-based electric mobility provider seems to have had a \u2018flew too close to the sun\u2019 moment as the roaring and dominant sales have been dulled down significantly.\n\nWhile Ola is still the highest-selling 2W EV manufacturer, it is not the dominant force anymore. Rivals like Bajaj and TVS have come a long way and they are poised to surpass Ola\u2019s figures and take over any time now. Their share price has also hit an all time low of Rs 64.6 on 28th Jan, which comes after the company launched 4,000 physical stores across India. In this post, we will analyse Ola\u2019s sales performance across CY24 and see just how much downfall Ola has had when compared to Bajaj and TVS.\n\nOla Electric CY24 Sales\n\nIf we take CY24 (Jan 2024 to Dec 2024), we can see how Ola has been losing market share with time. Ola kick-started CY24 with a 58.33% share (within this trio) in Q1 2024 which used to be close to three times more than Bajaj and TVS at 19.36% and 22.31%, respectively. By the end of CY2024, that number was reduced to 35.74%, while Bajaj was at 32.74% and TVS at 31.52%. In Q1 2024, Ola sold 1,19,418 units and accounted for 58.33% of sales within this trio. At the same time, Bajaj managed 39,628 units and TVS managed to sell 45,680 units. In Q2 2024, Ola sold 1,07,641 units, losing 11,777 units QoQ and the percentage share dropped to 54.46%. In Q2 2024, we can see that Bajaj and TVS showed QoQ growth and increased their percentage share among this trio.\n\nThis trio managed to clock a total of 4,02,374 units in H1 2024. Breaking the numbers, 2,27,059 units were from Ola, 80,482 from Bajaj and 94,833 from TVS. In Q3 2024, Ola\u2019s sales were reduced to 93,820 units, losing 13,821 units QoQ and accounted for 39.42% of sales within this trio, down from 54.46%.\n\nLowest numbers in Dec 2024 for Ola\n\nAt the same time, Bajaj and TVS showed significant growth as they sold 70,387 and 73,774 units respectively. Bajaj registered 29,533 units volume growth QoQ, while it was 24,621 for TVS. Bajaj\u2019s percentage share grew from 20.67% to 29.58%, while TVS\u2019 grew from 24.87% to 31% QoQ.\n\nThe results got a lot more interesting in Q4 2024 as Ola registered its worst-ever sales of CY24 in December 2024 at just 13,771 units. Ola\u2019s sales took a downfall from 93,820 units in Q3 2024 to 84,626 units in Q4 2024, losing 9,194 units in volume QoQ. At the same time, Bajaj and TVS sold 77,524 and 74,635 units respectively, registering positive growth QoQ.\n\nIn H2 2024, Ola, Bajaj and TVS managed to sell 4,74,766 electric scooters, up from 4,02,374 units in H1 2024. However, the impressive heavy lifting is done by Bajaj and TVS, while Ola has registered a massive decline in sales. Breaking the numbers, Ola sold 1,78,446 units, Bajaj 1,47,911 units and 1,48,409 units by TVS in H2 2024.\n\nThe numbers still place Ola at the top spot with 33,792 units monthly average in CY24, while it was 19,033 for Bajaj and 20,270 for TVS. However, that might change in CY25, with Bajaj and TVS likely to take off further in sales, leaving Ola behind, considering its sales pattern."

            "article_content": "Talk to many architects, and they\u2019ll likely tell you that Autodesk\u2019s software, including AutoCAD and Revit, has been indispensable to their work for decades.\n\nBut despite their widespread use, Autodesk\u2019s former co-CEO and chief product officer Amar Hanspal says that the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is using 20th century tools to design 21st century buildings. His latest startup, Motif \u2014 a company that Hanspal describes as a \u201cnext-generation design platform for buildings\u201d \u2014 is setting out to change that. It\u2019s now raised $46 million in aid of that effort.\n\nHanspal is coming to the problem on the heels of a long career already in the space of AEC technology. He spent about 20 years at Autodesk, and then in 2018 he co-founded Bright Machines, a manufacturing automation company (which itself has raised significant funding). Six years later, Hanspal left Bright Machines and was looking for his next act.\n\nHis exploration of the AEC industry revealed significant frustration among architects with existing software, which is largely not cloud-based and can take up to 45 minutes to process even simple edits.\n\nIn 2023, Hanspal teamed up with Brian Matthews, former product CTO at Autodesk, to work on Motif.\n\nMotif\u2019s first product won\u2019t be ready until the first half of this year but Hanspal gave a rough picture of what it would be. He said that Motif is working on building a platform that will offer a set of cloud-native 3D computer-aided design tools that will have elements of machine learning and AI.\n\nMotif founders Amar Hanspal and Brian Matthews. Image Credits:Motif\n\nThe $46 million that the startup has now raised is a combination of seed and Series A funding. The Series A was led by Capital G, Alphabet\u2019s growth fund, while Redpoint Ventures led the seed round.\n\nCapital G partner Jill Chase told TechCrunch that she was researching the software for architects before meeting Motif. She noticed that it\u2019s a very large market with outdated products.\n\nShe wondered why existing tools still haven\u2019t been disrupted and learned that putting 3D architecture models in the cloud is technically very difficult.\n\nIn addition to the engineering complexity, selling these tools could be challenging, Chase said. \u201cYou have to have some element of trust and relationships with big architecture firms for them to even let you in the door.\u201d\n\nWhen she met Henspal and Matthews, she immediately knew that their combined 40 years of experience in the AEC software industry will help them create a company that can take on incumbents.\n\nAs for why it is taking so long to release the first product, Henspal compared Motif\u2019s effort to design company Figma, which was in stealth mode for three years before releasing anything.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big and ambitious venture that we know will take a substantial amount of effort to pull off,\u201d Hanspal said.\n\nMotif is not alone in trying to disrupt AEC software. Other startups in the sector include Snaptrude and Arcol.\n\nBut Hanspal is certain that Motif has the best chance of winning in this market.\n\n\u201cIt really requires a very special team that is willing to do the hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s us.\u201d"

He has since denied the charges and pleaded not guilty.\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs was arrested on multiple charges last year (NBC via Getty Images)\n\nDiddy\u2019s Miami mansion was raided last year, with the unsettling discovery being made of large amounts of baby oil, lubricant, guns, and ammunition.\n\nThe lubricant and baby oil are thought to be linked to allegedly violent and drug-fuelled sex parties known as 'freak offs'.\n\nAdvert\n\nPines came forward and spoke about these parties which Combs would have him arrange for a 'laundry list' of paraphernalia.\n\nPines worked for the rapper and mogul from 2019 to 2021, and said he never personally attended the 'freak off' parties.\n\nThe former assistant did say, however, that other parties called Wild King Nights events would lead to him arranging the list of items Diddy required.\n\nPhil Pines opened up about working for the rapper in a new interview (Investigation Discovery)\n\nAdvert\n\nIn the interview, conducted by Investigation Discovery, he said: \"We usually had a laundry list of items that included lights, alcohol, marijuana, ketamine, Molly.\n\n\"You have mushrooms on the top there \u2026 baby oil and astroglide [lubricant] are very important; candles, incense, Apple TVs, electronics, computers, iPads.

Is this a test for entertainment, does he know he's doing this? Is he that gone?' I didn't know what to do.\"\n\nHarrowing allegations have come out about the rapper and his 'freak off' parties (Samir Hussein via Getty Images)\n\nPines said the woman consented to the sex and 'performed' until Diddy was out of sight, at which point he ran away.\n\nHe claimed that he had 'never really recovered from' the incident.\n\nCombs currently awaits trial in Brooklyn, New York, and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article and wish to speak to someone in confidence, contact The Survivors Trust for free on 08088 010 818, available 10am-12.30pm, 1.30pm-3pm and 6pm-8pm Monday to Thursday, 10am-12.30pm and 1.30pm-3pm on Fridays, 10am-12.30pm on Saturdays and 6pm-8pm on Sundays."

            "article_content": "Never before had cleaning off so shaped history. But when an Egyptian princess went to take a quick dip in the Nile, her discovery and rescue of baby Moses in his basket set the Israelites on their path toward that eventual dramatic escape from the shackles of Egypt.\n\nThe second chapter of Exodus sets the scene: \u201cThe daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her attendants walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid (amatah) to bring it. When she opened it, she saw the child. He was crying, and she took pity on him. \u2018This must be one of the Hebrews\u2019 children,\u2019 she said.\u201d\n\nMiriam, Moses\u2019 sister, having held out hope at the riverbank that somehow her brother might sail past the clutches of Pharaoh\u2019s decree that all male Jewish children be slaughtered, saw what unfolded and helpfully offered to find a nursemaid to suckle the child. That volunteer caretaker she recommended, of course, was secretly Moses\u2019 biological mother, Yocheved. Moses then grew up in the palace of the king but with the spiritual and national mentorship of his Jewish family, uniquely positioning him to lead his people to freedom.\n\nThe act of warm-heartedness of this unnamed Egyptian was, ever since, celebrated by the Jewish tradition.\n\nMoses\u2019s rescue-by-princess was depicted on the western wall of the ruins of the ancient synagogue ruins found in Dura-Europos, modern-day Syria, in a rendering dated to the mid-third century C.E. In it, Pharaoh is off to the side, seated on his throne. A scribe next to him writes down the royal commands \u2014 no doubt the order to execute babies, the very edict his own daughter disobeys.\n\nRabbinic texts also parsed every aspect of the brief episode. Why did she need to go bathe, they wondered? Sefer HaYashar suggests a sunburn. God had sent a heatwave, which seared the Egyptians and left them seeking a means of cooling off. Perhaps, came another conjecture, she had that awful skin disease, tzara\u2019at. Thus Shemot Rabbah\u2019s proposal that \u201cPharaoh\u2019s daughter was a leper; that is why she went to bathe. When she touched the basket she was cured. That is why she had compassion for Moses and loved him exceedingly.\u201d\n\nPirkei deRebbe Eliezer adds that her sensitive skin required the cold Nile water, as opposed to the warm water of an indoor facility. Her subsequent reward, though unspecified in the Bible itself, was eternal bliss \u2013 \u201cWhosoever preserves a life is as though he had kept alive the whole world. Therefore was she worthy to (inherit) the life in this world and the life in the world to come.\u201d Mystical texts record her entering the heavenly realm alive, sitting alongside Elijah and the Messiah.\n\nThe Talmud, in turn, senses a sign of her personal fealty to the Jewish cause as an aspiring convert to the faith. \u201cRabbi Yohanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai: This teaches that she came down to the river to cleanse herself from the impurity of her father\u2019s idols, as she was immersing herself as part of the conversion process.\u201d\n\nNo doubt miracles enabled the shocking rescue. She felt compelled to head to the site because of a dream, offered the first-century work Biblical Antiquities. Other texts add that the princess saw the Divine Presence hovering above Moses. When her maidens tried to convince her not to save him, the angel Gabriel came from heaven and struck them down. Though perhaps it wasn\u2019t a maiden she sent to grab the basket, but rather her arm stretched many cubits (amot) to enable her to grab it.\n\nAnother Talmudic tractate gives the anonymous-in-the-Bible heroine a name reflecting her loyalty to Israel\u2019s God. Actually, two names. She was called Bityah (\u201cGod\u2019s daughter) or Yehudiyah (\u201cJewess\u201d).\n\nWas she even Pharaoh\u2019s biological daughter? A surprising Midrash Talpiot argued that she was not. Rather, she and Moses\u2019 future wife Tziporah were Moses\u2019 biological sisters (!). The former was seized by force by the Egyptian king, and the latter by Jethro, Pharaoh\u2019s adviser and Moses\u2019 eventual father-in-law, and raised in their respective homes. (Lest one be shocked that Moses, according to this text, eventually married his sister, the midrash notes that this was permissible prior to Sinai, and Tziporah was uniquely righteous.)\n\nOf course, suggests the Arukh HaShulchan, Pharaoh\u2019s daughter was spared the death of the firstborn \u2014 the 10th of those notorious Plagues \u2014 in the merit of Moshe, whose life she had saved.\n\nMoses undoubtedly expressed gratitude for the rescue. As the scholar of the Second Temple period Malka Simkovich has noted, Ezekiel the Tragedian, a second- or first-century B.C.E. Jew who lived in Egypt, composed a Greek play whose verses have Moses reminiscing how: \u201cThroughout my boyhood years the princess did, for princely rearing and instruction apt, provide all things, as though I were her own, the circle of the days then being full.\u201d\n\nSimkovich also notes that the second century BCE Book of Jubilees calls Bityah a different name, Thermuthis, as does the historian Josephus. A popular Greek name for Egyptian women at the time, it\u2019s a variation of the Egyptian Renen\u016btet, the Egyptian goddess of nourishment, from the verb meaning \u201cto nurse or rear,\u201d a fitting appellation for the adoptive figure.\n\nIn Josephus\u2019 dramatic detailing, after the extraordinary rescue, she hoped Moses would himself become king: \u201c\u2026 one day she brought Moses to her father and showed him to him, and told him how she had been mindful for the succession, were it God\u2019s will to grant her no child of her own, by bringing up a boy of divine beauty and generous spirit, and by what a miracle she had received him of the river\u2019s bounty, \u2018and I thought,\u2019 she said, \u2018to make him my child and heir to your kingdom.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlas, in playing with his adopted grandson, Pharaoh freaks out. \u201cTo please his daughter, [he] placed his diadem upon [Moses\u2019] head. But Moses tore it off and flung it to the ground, in mere childishness, and trampled it underfoot; and this was taken as an omen of evil import to the kingdom.\u201d\n\nWhen the adult Moses led his people to liberation, Bityah joined her now-fellow Jews and went too. In her old age, she married Caleb, who, alongside Joshua, encouraged the desert-wandering Israelite tribes to ignore the bad report of the spies who had returned from scouting the Promised Land. As the Talmud tells it, \u201cThe Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let Caleb, who rebelled against the advice of the spies, come and marry the daughter of Pharaoh, who rebelled against the idols of her father\u2019s home.\u201d\n\nModern literary scholars have suggested the princess\u2019 salvation foreshadows God\u2019s own extension of His saving hands to His people. Pharaoh\u2019s daughter\u2019s coming down and seeing a baby crying is mirrored by God\u2019s actions in Exodus\u2019 third chapter, which has Him telling the now adult Moses \u201cI have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out \u2026 So I have come down to rescue them.\u201d\n\nThe bath of Bityah (or Yehudiyah or Thermuthis) then, even without the rabbinic accounts of the many miracles involved in her saving of Moses and subsequent religious conversion, offers a model for those non-palace-dwellers of us to follow. If her dunk to cool off on that hot Egyptian afternoon teaches us anything, it\u2019s that small acts of kindness to the other might very well draw forth God\u2019s salvation for us all.\n\nRabbi Dr. Stuart Halpern is Senior Adviser to the Provost of Yeshiva University and Deputy Director of Y.U.\u2019s Straus Center for Torah and Western Thought.
