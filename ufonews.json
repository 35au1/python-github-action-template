        "article_content": "The Argentine comedy \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs\u2019 tells the story of entertainment journalist Jos\u00e9 de Zer in the 1980s. After hearing reports of a UFO sighting in La Candelaria, Jos\u00e9 embarks on a trip with his cameraman, Chango, to find the truth behind the paranormal claims. However, when paltry field evidence surfaces, the protagonist devises a different method to turn the story into a media sensation.\n\nDirected by Diego Lerman, the Netflix film plots a whimsical tale brimming with nostalgia and amusement centered on making aliens believable to the watching public and one man\u2019s efforts to fabricate his own version of events. As the attention grows on the subject matter, the lines between reality and fiction are blurred in a complex drama about personal conceit and the power of belief.\n\nThe Man Who Loved UFOs is a Vague Retelling of a Real Journalist\u2019s Story\n\nOriginally titled \u2018El Hombre Que Amaba Los Platos Voladores\u2019 in Spanish, \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs\u2019 is loosely inspired by the exploits of a real Argentine journalist, Jos\u00e9 de Zer. Written by Diego Lerman and Adri\u00e1n Biniez, the film taps into a mission led by Jos\u00e9 in 1986, when he concocted a report about an alleged UFO landing site close to Uritorco Mountain in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain. The actual evidence was meager and only amounted to some burnt pasture in the middle of nowhere. Jos\u00e9 had heard about it from tabloid reports while working in an area outside C\u00f3rdoba. Subsequently, he recorded footage of the pasture, burnt insects, cave hieroglyphics, and weird lights in the night sky as examples of the alien hauntings in the rural area.\n\nJos\u00e9 spent six months in C\u00f3rdoba, becoming a household name among the public as viewership numbers spiked for his TV network. However, years later, his reports were discovered to be false, and so was the evidence he had presented. For instance, the lights in his videos were found to be cigarettes and flashlights, the burnt insects were planted by Jos\u00e9, and the cave hieroglyphics were nothing more than rock paintings done in his hotel room. The movie attempts to explain the motivations behind Jos\u00e9\u2019s actions by stating it as a form of escapism. For the news-watching public who are tired of the regular coverage of politics, a fabricated truth allows them to believe in something greater than themselves.\n\nThe Movie Blurs the Lines Between Fiction and Reality\n\nWhile Jos\u00e9 de Zer\u2019s real-life case may have inspired the film, much of the narrative deviates from the actual events, including the presence of strange, inexplicable things that border on the paranormal. Even outside the various plot elements, director Diego Lerman stated that while crafting the ins and outs of Jos\u00e9\u2019s life, he had to imagine a majority of the character\u2019s backstory and the people around him. \u201cHe did his public things, but he guarded his private life. So I imagined a lot,\u201d the filmmaker said. The movie places great emphasis on the protagonist\u2019s relationship with his daughter, Martina, whose approval seems to dictate a lot of Jos\u00e9\u2019s motivations. However, the familial dynamics pale in comparison to some of the other exaggerated elements of the story, most importantly the nature of the UFO sightings themselves.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Lerman explained, \u201cThe film does the same thing that Jose did. You don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real or not. It\u2019s all this fiction machine to build a dream or whatever in your imagination. And I did the same. It was so much fun and so great to do the film. I enjoyed it so much, like a kid. The film shows that this is a machine that will make you dream for a moment.\u201d The director insisted that at its heart, the film targets the notion of faith, existence, and believing in a higher power, all amidst an outlandish scenario where a lot of fakery is involved. As such, the story maintains an air of mystery surrounding the possibility of aliens, never disclosing the truth either way except by layering it through the reporter\u2019s eyes.\n\nJos\u00e9 de Zer passed away on April 2, 1997, while battling against Parkinson\u2019s disease and esophageal cancer. His work pioneered a wave of popularity for Argentine TV despite its questionable methods. However, Director Lerman characterized his actions as \u201cmuch more innocent\u201d than they might be viewed today, given the context surrounding 80s media. It also highlighted one of the key themes he wanted to capture in the movie \u2013 fake news, which is a topic that also plagues contemporary discourse. Still, the filmmaker wanted to acknowledge the importance of the other motifs that contribute heavily to the subtext within the narrative. \u201cThere are several levels, different layers that I wanted to develop. It\u2019s a kind of comedy, so I try to tell everything through the eyes of Jose,\u201d Lerman summed up.\n\nRead More: Best Biopics on Netflix"

        "article_content": "UFO 50 is a good game. In fact, according to our UFO 50 review, it's a great game. Yet one dedicated fan thought that just admiring it from afar wasn't good enough. Building a dedicated PC specifically for playing the game is the answer, and I admire them for it.\n\nAn aptly named LukeTheMaker over on Twitter shared the original concept for a mockup of the LX computer found in the fictional world of UFO 50 earlier this month. In it, they shared that \"UFO 50 has taken over my life\". Then, Luke proceeded to spend weeks continuing to build it.\n\nNow, mere weeks later, they have a fully playable build. The UFO 50 computer has a retro tinge to it, with a blocky build, and angular uses of grey, black, and red, to accentuate its design. You can spot the original at the start of the launch trailer for the game but it seems like a very faithful rendition from the videos shown.\n\nTo put into context why this all matters, UFO 50 is a video game made up of 50 arcade-style titles, all created by Mossmouth (Spelunky), Moppin (Downwell), and FourbitFriday (Catacomb Kids). It's a celebration of retro games and seems intended to convoke the feeling of playing an arcade or one of those dodgy 200-in-1 plug-and-play machines you'd buy as a kid.\n\nThe version Luke has built seems to be a shell that you can essentially wrap around a small PC, but it has inputs on the front for plugging in an NES-style controller and a select button on the shell itself. Curiously, the machine even plays a small sound when you plug in a controller, which is a lovely touch.\n\nIt's done. Thanks for all the support and the new followers! If you're interested in getting the files I will likely be making them available for 5-10 dollars via my Printables and Etsy store in a week or so. Happy to answer any questions about it! pic.twitter.com/KB8sTuuv7KOctober 17, 2024\n\nNotably, there's also an adapter for its inputs that allows you to connect a more modern USB controller. It's a gorgeous interpretation of the game's arcade machine, and the files to 3D print it yourself \"will likely\" be available on Luke's Etsy next week.\n\nIf you're going to play UFO 50, you might as well play it in style.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

Currently, it's only available to subscribers of Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu versions of ChatGPT, and users can download it for free in the Microsoft Store for Windows.\n\nOpenAI is positioning the release as a beta test. \"This is an early version, and we plan to bring the full experience to all users later this year,\" OpenAI writes on the Microsoft Store entry for the app. (Interestingly, ChatGPT shows up as being rated \"T for Teen\" by the ESRB in the Windows store, despite not being a video game.)\n\nCredit: Benj Edwards A screenshot of the new Windows ChatGPT app captured on October 18, 2024. A screenshot of the new Windows ChatGPT app captured on October 18, 2024. Credit: Benj Edwards\n\nUpon downloading the app and running it, OpenAI requires users to log into a paying ChatGPT account, and from there, the app is basically identical to the web browser version of ChatGPT. You can currently use it to access several models: GPT-4o, GPT-4o with Canvas, 01-preview, 01-mini, GPT-4o mini, and GPT-4. Also, it can generate images using DALL-E 3 or analyze uploaded files and images.\n\nIf you're running Windows 11, you can instantly call up a small ChatGPT window when the app is open using an Alt+Space shortcut (it did not work in Windows 10 when we tried). That could be handy for asking ChatGPT a quick question at any time.\n\nCredit: Benj Edwards A screenshot of the new Windows ChatGPT app listing in the Microsoft Store captured on October 18, 2024.

As OpenAI says in a small disclaimer at the bottom of the app window: \"ChatGPT can make mistakes.\""

        "article_content": "\u201cWe\u2019re really firm believers that by contributing to the community and building upon open-source data models, the whole community moves further, faster,\u201d says Larry Zitnick, the lead researcher for the OMat project.\n\nZitnick says the newOMat24 model will top the Matbench Discovery leaderboard, which ranks the best machine-learning models for materials science. Its data set will also be one of the biggest available.\n\n\u201cMaterials science is having a machine-learning revolution,\u201d says Shyue Ping Ong, a professor of nanoengineering at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the project.\n\nPreviously, scientists were limited to doing very accurate calculations of material properties on very small systems or doing less accurate calculations on very big systems, says Ong. The processes were laborious and expensive. Machine learning has bridged that gap, and AI models allow scientists to perform simulations on combinations of any elements in the periodic table much more quickly and cheaply, he says.\n\nMeta\u2019s decision to make its data set openly available is more significant than the AI model itself, says G\u00e1bor Cs\u00e1nyi, a professor of molecular modeling at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work.\n\n\u201cThis is in stark contrast to other large industry players such as Google and Microsoft, which also recently published competitive-looking models which were trained on equally large but secret data sets,\u201d Cs\u00e1nyi says.\n\nTo create the OMat24 data set, Meta took an existing one called Alexandria and sampled materials from it. Then they ran various simulations and calculations of different atoms to scale it.\n\nMeta\u2019s data set has around 110 million data points, which is many times larger than earlier ones. Others also don\u2019t necessarily have high-quality data, says Ong."

Learn more about the growth and key trends in India's software export sector.\n\nMumbai, Oct 18 (PTI) India's total exports of software services, including services delivered by foreign affiliates of Indian companies, increased to USD 205.2 billion during 2023-24 from USD 200.6 billion in the previous fiscal, according to a Reserve Bank survey.\n\n\n\nIndia's exports of software services (excluding their sales through overseas commercial presence) increased by 2.8 per cent during 2023-24 to USD 190.7 billion, according to the data related to the 2023-24 round of RBI annual survey on computer software and information technology enabled-services (ITES) exports.\n\n\n\nThe US was the major software export destination with a 54 per cent share, followed by Europe (31 per cent share), where the United Kingdom was a major destination country, according to the data.\n\n\n\nIn the survey, 7,226 software export companies were contacted, of which 2,266 firms, including most of the large companies, responded. The participating companies together accounted for nearly 89 per cent of total software services exports.\n\n\n\n\"Computer services accounted for over two-thirds of India's total software services exports during the year; BPO services remained the dominant component of ITES exports,\" the survey said, adding private limited companies recorded higher growth in export of software services when compared to that by public limited companies.\n\n\n\nFurther, the US dollar remained the principal invoicing currency for India's software exports with a 72 per cent share, followed by the euro, rupee and pound sterling.\n\n\n\nIn terms of modes of delivery, cross-border supply of software services inched up to 83.5 per cent in 2023-24, whereas the share of overseas commercial presence mode of delivery declined to 7 per cent from 7.5 per cent in the previous year and 13.7 per cent in 2013-14.\n\n\n\nOffsite services accounted for 90 per cent of the total export of software services.

        "article_content": "Earlier today, OnePlus confirmed plans for its next-gen software overhaul based on Android 15, but so far, details of its upcoming flagship have remained tightly under wraps. Well, it seems leaks have other intentions.\n\nOn the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo, an image allegedly depicting the OnePlus 13 has been making rounds. Moreover, the material comes from a reliable source (Digital Chat Station), which lends further credibility to the leak.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhen it comes to the design, it seems that OnePlus is playing it close home once again. The camera island at the back appears to have been borrowed from the OnePlus 12. This time around, however, we have a small metallic line linking the camera hump to the right edge of the frame.\n\nAbove the line is a minimalist \u201cH\u201d logo, which is again a clear sign that Hasselblad camera tuning will also be used on the OnePlus 13. The most notable change, however, seems to be flat metallic sides.\n\nOver the past few generations, OnePlus flagships have sided with curved metallic frames, which actually feel a lot more comfortable to hold. The imminent tweak seems like an undesirable change and one that follows in the aesthetic footsteps of Samsung and Apple.\n\nBut what sets the OnePlus 13 apart is the texture on the rear shell, which is apparently inspired by rocks or minerals of some kind, with a familiar matte texture to it. I am quite fond of the surface finish on the OnePlus 12, and the leaked image suggests that the upcoming phone won\u2019t stray too far.\n\nOnePlus recently told Digital Trends that it is experimenting with natural materials like marble to design its phones, and so far, the results have been mighty impressive.\n\nIn addition to a black trim, it seems a pearl-white color option is also on the design table for the OnePlus 13. The company already offers something similar on the OnePlus 12, and my colleague Tushar Mehta liked it so much that he labeled it as \u201cElvis Presley of Android Phones.\u201d\n\nAs far as the innards go, there will be three camera lenses at the back, while the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 silicon will provide the firepower. We are also hearing rumors of a unique localized refresh rate tech for the screen, a larger battery, and some AI boost for the OxygenOS software experience.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems a price hike will also tag along with the long list of generation-over-generation changes. The phone is expected to launch close to the end of October, but that\u2019s likely the release timeline for the Chinese market, while a global debut will commence a few weeks later."
