            "article_content": "A viral photo showing four mysterious lights hovering above the Statue of Freedom on the US Capitol dome in Washington, D.C., has sparked panic and fueled theories of an extraterrestrial coup. The image, captured by US Air Force veteran and licensed tour guide Dennis Diggins, has prompted a mix of concern, curiosity, and skepticism among online users.\n\nThe photo quickly spread across social media, igniting debates about whether the lights were evidence of extraterrestrial activity. Some onlookers believed the lights were UFOs and that aliens \"have arrived on Earth.\"\n\nAdding to the intrigue, the alleged UFO sighting comes just weeks after a U.S. Congressional hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\" where witnesses testified about secret government programs allegedly aimed at concealing evidence of non-human intelligence.\n\nWhile speculation ran rampant, skeptics and experts have been quick to offer alternative explanations. John Greenewald Jr., a ufologist and researcher, took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the controversy surrounding the lights captured in Diggins's photo. Greenewald explained that the lights at the U.S. Capitol building have been causing \"UFO sightings\" in camera lenses for decades, attributing the lights in Diggins's photo to a common optical phenomenon.\n\nSimilarly, \"Average Chris,\" a former paranormal investigator, argued that the lights were merely lens flares. \"The picture is clearly a glare reflection off of the lens of the camera of the street lights below it. Same spacing, just inverted pattern,\" he stated, as reported by Vice News. Despite these explanations, other eyewitnesses in the Washington area believed they had recorded similar UFOs on video during the same afternoon, Newsbomb reported.\n\nAn anonymous witness who recorded the event on video stated, \"My girlfriend and I spotted a mix of multiple steady hovering and slowly moving lights from the rooftop of her apartment in Washington. They seem to be hovering over the hill.\"\n\nAn ominous quartet of gleaming lights above the US Capitol building, like landing lights on some otherworldly craft, have left some afraid the alien invasion has finally arrived.

Vice News reported that Gough stated to Daily Mail, \"I don't have anything for you on this,\" and suggested reporters check with local police.\n\nFormer Pentagon intelligence officer Chris Mellon highlighted concerns about unidentified aerial phenomena. In an interview with Daily Mail.com, he stated that the \"craft are making no effort to remain concealed.\"\n\nIn its March report, the Pentagon addressed ongoing UFO sightings, concluding that most were misidentified ordinary objects or natural phenomena.

            "article_content": "The recent congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly known as UFOs, has ignited a call for transparency from lawmakers across the political spectrum.\n\nDuring the hearing, Chairwoman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, Nancy Mace, said:\n\n\u201cI obviously would like to know how much taxpayers are spending on this. You have the right to know. And if we are spending money on something that doesn\u2019t exist, why are we spending the money? And if it does exist, why are we hiding it from the public? Of course, national security is a big issue and if there is technology that could harm us or our allies that are in the hands of our adversaries, we obviously want to stay ahead of that to the best of our abilities.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Defense, which oversees UAP research, is set to receive a proposed budget of $850 billion in 2025. However, the exact amount spent on UAP research remains unclear, contributing to congressional frustration over the perceived secrecy surrounding the issue. The Department of Defense\u2019s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established in 2022, is tasked with investigating these phenomena.\n\nA group of bipartisan lawmakers in Congress introduced the UAP Transparency Act, which would require the declassification of all federal documents related to UAPs. The bill mandates that the president instruct federal agencies to release UAP research documents to the public within 270 days and provide Congress with quarterly progress reports. The UAP Transparency Act was referred to the House Oversight and Accountability Committee in May, but no further action has been taken.\n\nAARO reviewed 757 new UAP reports between May 2023 and June 2024, identifying 21 cases that \u201cmerit further analysis\u201d due to their \u201canomalous characteristics and/or behaviors.\u201d Despite these findings, AARO\u2019s report stated there is no evidence to suggest extraterrestrial life is responsible for these sightings.\n\n\u201cThere are interesting cases that I, with my physics and engineering background and time in the intelligence community, do not understand. And I don\u2019t know anybody else who understands them either,\u201d said Jon Kosloski, the director of AARO.\n\nHave a news tip? Contact Emma Withrow at ewithrow@sbgtv.com or at x.com/emma_withrow.

            "article_content": "(Stacker) - When pilot Kenneth Arnold took off from Chehalis, Washington, in his single-engine airplane one afternoon in June 1947, he was looking for a lost military aircraft that had crashed. But what he found was something completely different\u2014something that would set off a cultural obsession in the U.S. that persists today.\n\nWhile flying around Mount Rainier, Arnold reportedly encountered nine curious, wingless objects speeding through the sky at 1,200 mph, faster than any plane at the time could. Arnold spent years afterward trying to describe what he had seen, reportedly using a term that has been ingrained in the American lexicon ever since: \"flying saucer.\"\n\nSince then, Americans have been uniquely fixated on the idea that aliens are somewhere in the sky above us\u2014and the number who believe that to be true is growing. In 2019, a Gallup survey found that 33% of Americans believed some UFOs were alien spacecrafts, while 60% felt they could all be explained by human activity or some natural phenomenon. Just two years later, in 2021, 41% of respondents said they believed at least some UFOs were alien-related compared to 50% who were confident any sightings could be explained by human behavior or scientific events.\n\nThere are two main reasons that belief in aliens has become so prevalent in the United States: government hearings and pop culture.\n\nAmerica\u2019s film industry has always been one of the most influential in the world, and a wave of science fiction films in the 1950s, like \u201cThe Day the Earth Stood Still\u201d and \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d perpetuated the idea that there are other life-forms out there. This continues today with alien-centric sci-fi staples like the \u201cAvatar\u201d franchise and the \u201cQuiet Place\u201d movies dominating the box office.\n\nRather than leave flying saucers to the domain of Hollywood, the U.S. government has addressed the question of UFOs, only adding further speculation. In April 2020, the Department of Defense released multiple videos filmed by military pilots that were thought to possibly capture UFOs. In July 2023, an Air Force veteran came forward to the House of Representatives claiming that the U.S. military has been keeping important information on \u201cnonhuman\u201d sightings secret since the 1930s.\n\nJust like it did in the 1950s amid Cold War paranoia, the lore of UFOs is also currently experiencing a resurgence as many Americans grow concerned about national security. The infamous Chinese spy balloon panic in 2023 and fears over being infiltrated by the Russian government have led to many reporting seeing UFOs in the sky. People are also mistaking the spike in Starlink satellites for extraterrestrial activity. In November 2024, the Pentagon announced that most reported sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs, as they\u2019re now known) can be attributed to balloons, drones, and other regular objects, while still noting that many objects lack a sufficient explanation.\n\nUAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it\u2019s easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they\u2019ve seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWhile New Mexico and Nevada are perhaps best known for UFO sightings, the National UFO Reporting Center data shows that the state with the most sightings is California, with more than 16,500 reports as of Nov. 21, 2024. But what do the numbers look like in your metro area?\n\nStacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Wisconsin using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis.\n\nFor now, the U.S. government\u2019s official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America\u2019s alien obsession.\n\nNote: The images in this article are stock photos and do not necessarily depict the specific cities or events described listed.\n\nSergey Tinyakov // Shutterstock\n\n#10.

            "article_content": "A man has revealed the spooky moment he spotted a 'UFO' on camera flying over a UK city.\n\nGerard Delaney, 47, took the photo from Mart Street in central Glasgow at around 8.45am on Saturday while working to fix the road there - but at first, he said he didn't even notice the set of lights up in the sky in front of him.\n\nThe workman from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, who used to be in the military, said: \"I didn't actually notice it at first, I sent the photo to my girlfriend to show her the job I was doing in the town. She text me and asked what it was, then that's when I saw it and realised I had to get the photo out there on the internet.\"\n\nHis photo has not gone unnoticed among alien-hunters. One said the pic was \"one of better captures of UFO activities I've seen\" because it was a clear day, the 'craft' was below the clouds and there was no obvious lens flare.\n\nImage: Gerard Delaney/Triangle News) Gerard Delaney/Triangle News) Image: Gerard Delaney/Triangle News) Gerard Delaney/Triangle News)\n\nSome said they thought it was a light from Elon Musk's satellite constellation Starlink, but they were immediately rebuffed. \"How anyone can say that is Starlink has obviously never seen Starlink,\" one person said on the Facebook group for UFO hunters. Someone else said: \"What a catch and in broad daylight too! No way is that Starlink!\". And another added: \"That is strange, I wouldn't say that was Starlink. It is by definition a UFO, good pic.\"\n\nBut Gerard was also hit with a host of scathing jokes about how little green men would have swiftly returned home if they'd got out of their spaceship in the area. One commenter said: \"Glasgow? Had to move that fast or someone would steal it. If it landed in Glasgow it'd pretty soon leave again!!!\" said another. One added: \"Imagine the language barrier if they met a couple of bams from Easterhouse??!! I'd feel sorry for the aliens.\" Another joked: \"l'd have given them a wee taste of the Buckie.\"\n\nAnother person described the image as \"weird and strange\", while someone else thought it was Father Christmas. One poster said: \"Definitely a UFO as it's under the clouds and Starlink are very high up.\" Another added: \"Good photo, Starlink is low orbit, but not that low. In front of cloud, no sun shadow on the ground, obviously too cloudy so not obviously lens flair unless there is a strong artificial light off camera.\n\n\n\n\"Unless some people are trying out a synchronised drone display, or that's a very high wire of Christmas lights or Christmas Market lazer spot light display, this holds up well. Well done, one of the better captures of UFO activities I've seen on this group.\"\n\n\n\nIt comes days after a UFO was also seen by a mum in Kirkwood near Glasgow. Sabine Gilbert, 36, was left \"flabbergasted\" by the weird orb she witnessed just before 9pm on Thursday night."

            "article_content": "A viral photo showing four mysterious lights hovering above the Statue of Freedom on the US Capitol dome in Washington, D.C., has sparked panic and fueled theories of an extraterrestrial coup. The image, captured by US Air Force veteran and licensed tour guide Dennis Diggins, has prompted a mix of concern, curiosity, and skepticism among online users.\n\nThe photo quickly spread across social media, igniting debates about whether the lights were evidence of extraterrestrial activity. Some onlookers believed the lights were UFOs and that aliens \"have arrived on Earth.\"\n\nAdding to the intrigue, the alleged UFO sighting comes just weeks after a U.S. Congressional hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\" where witnesses testified about secret government programs allegedly aimed at concealing evidence of non-human intelligence.\n\nWhile speculation ran rampant, skeptics and experts have been quick to offer alternative explanations. John Greenewald Jr., a ufologist and researcher, took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the controversy surrounding the lights captured in Diggins's photo. Greenewald explained that the lights at the U.S. Capitol building have been causing \"UFO sightings\" in camera lenses for decades, attributing the lights in Diggins's photo to a common optical phenomenon.\n\nSimilarly, \"Average Chris,\" a former paranormal investigator, argued that the lights were merely lens flares. \"The picture is clearly a glare reflection off of the lens of the camera of the street lights below it. Same spacing, just inverted pattern,\" he stated, as reported by Vice News. Despite these explanations, other eyewitnesses in the Washington area believed they had recorded similar UFOs on video during the same afternoon, Newsbomb reported.\n\nAn anonymous witness who recorded the event on video stated, \"My girlfriend and I spotted a mix of multiple steady hovering and slowly moving lights from the rooftop of her apartment in Washington. They seem to be hovering over the hill.\"\n\nAn ominous quartet of gleaming lights above the US Capitol building, like landing lights on some otherworldly craft, have left some afraid the alien invasion has finally arrived.

Vice News reported that Gough stated to Daily Mail, \"I don't have anything for you on this,\" and suggested reporters check with local police.\n\nFormer Pentagon intelligence officer Chris Mellon highlighted concerns about unidentified aerial phenomena. In an interview with Daily Mail.com, he stated that the \"craft are making no effort to remain concealed.\"\n\nIn its March report, the Pentagon addressed ongoing UFO sightings, concluding that most were misidentified ordinary objects or natural phenomena.

            "article_content": "A groundbreaking discovery in the field of paleoanthropology has shed light on a new human species called Homo juluensis, with distinctively large skulls. Dubbed \"Large Head People,\" this enigmatic group once lived alongside Homo sapiens in eastern Asia. According to Science Alert, fossilised remains unearthed from sediment layers dated over 200,000 years ago revealed individuals with disproportionately large cranial volumes. Initial measurements indicate that their braincases were up to 30% larger than those of Homo sapiens.\n\nHomo juluensis lived approximately 300,000 years ago in eastern Asia, hunted wild horses in small groups, and made stone tools and possibly processed animal hides for survival before disappearing around 50,000 years ago.\n\n\"Collectively, these fossils represent a new form of large-brained hominin,\" Paleoanthropologist Xiujie Wu from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and anthropologist Christopher Bae from the University of Hawai'i wrote in the journal PaleoAnthropology earlier this year.\n\nThe unique combination of characteristics exhibited by the Large Head People suggests a complex ancestry, resulting from interbreeding between different hominin groups that coexisted in Asia between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago, the researchers said.\n\n\"Although we started this project several years ago, we did not expect to be able to propose a new hominin (human ancestor) species and then to be able to organize the hominin fossils from Asia into different groups,\" said Christopher Bae.\n\nFossils attributed to H. juluensis, primarily consisting of facial and jaw remains, exhibit dental characteristics reminiscent of Neanderthals. However, certain distinctive traits are unlike those found in any other known hominin species, including the Denisovans, setting H. juluensis apart from its ancient human relatives.\n\n\"It is becoming increasingly clear that [in] the eastern Asian hominin fossils\u2026 a greater degree of morphological variation is present than originally assumed or anticipated,\" wrote Wu and Bae.\n\nThe emergence of the 'Large Head People' raises fundamental questions about human evolution, diversity, and migration patterns. Some scientists speculate that this group might have played a significant role in shaping the genetic landscape of modern humans.\n\n"

Close Read more\n\nA breakthrough brain circuit discovery may lead to new treatments for anxiety and stress disorders, and potentially a pill providing the benefits of yoga.\n\nResearchers from the Salk Institute in the US have discovered the pathway behind voluntary breathing and emotional regulation in mice brains.\n\nTheir study, published recently in the journal Nature Neuroscience, reveals connections between the brain\u2019s more complex regions and the breathing centre of the primitive brainstem which enables breathing coordination with emotional state.\n\nWhile breathing is mainly automatic, human beings and some animals can self-soothe by slowing breathing, an approach that\u2019s a central part of practices like mindfulness and yoga.\n\nHow exactly the brain regulates breathing and how this impacts anxiety and one\u2019s emotional state is little understood. Scientists say only subconscious breathing mechanisms in the brainstem have been thoroughly understood so far.\n\nNeurons in mouse brain behind breathing regulation ( Salk Institute )\n\nIn the new study, researchers set out to find conscious top-down mechanisms connecting emotional regulation and breathing.\n\nThey first assessed a brain connectivity database to probe connections between different brain areas. The analysis revealed a potential breathing circuit connecting a frontal region, called the anterior cingulate cortex, to an intermediate brainstem area, which then connected to the medulla just below.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the medulla, when active, initiates breathing but signals coming down from a brainstem region are known to inhibit this activity and slow down breathing.\n\nResearchers hypothesised that certain emotions or behaviours could lead to the activation of the brainstem region, which in turn could lower activity in the medulla and slower breath.\n\nHow Breathing Exercises Can Reduce Anxiety\n\nTo test the theory, they recorded brain activity in mice when their breathing was altered during activities like sniffing, swimming, and drinking as well as during conditions inducing fear and anxiety.\n\nResearchers found that when the connection between the cortex and the brainstem region was activated, mice were calmer and breathed more slowly.\n\nThis communication decreased when they were in anxiety-inducing situations, and breathing rates went up.\n\nBy following this pathway, researchers discovered a group of neurons in the frontal cortex of the mice brain that connects to the brainstem and governs essential functions like breathing.\n\n8 Foods That Help With Anxiety According To Experts\n\nThis connection, researchers say, enables mice to coordinate their breathing with their current behaviour and emotional state.\n\nFurther analysis of the connection revealed a new set of brain cells and molecules which scientists believe can be targeted with drugs.\n\nResearchers say the findings may lead to long-term solutions for people with anxiety, stress, and panic disorders.\n\n\u201cOur findings got me thinking: could we develop drugs to activate these neurons and manually slow our breathing or prevent hyperventilation in panic disorder?\u201d study co-author Jinho Jhang said.\n\n\u201cI want to use these findings to design a yoga pill. It may sound silly, and the translation of our work into a marketable drug will take years, but we now have a potentially targetable brain circuit for creating therapeutics that could instantly slow breathing and initiate a peaceful, meditative state,\u201d Sung Han, another author of the study, said."

If you don\u2019t do your best or have a history of dishonesty, it becomes a risk factor, and we won\u2019t move forward.\u201d\n\nRead also: African agrotech startups raised $1.56bn in one decade \u2014 Briter Bridges\n\nAboyeji stressed that founders must manage their perceptions and ensure their actions align with the values they want to project.\n\nSecondly, for Aboyeji, the act of launching separates an idea from a startup. \u201cThe barrier to launching is purely psychological,\u201d he remarked.\n\nHe advised founders not to wait for perfect conditions before putting their ideas into the market.\n\n\u201cWhen startups come to me and say, \u2018I need investment to launch,\u2019 I tell them, \u2018No, just launch. No matter how bad or crude, just get started.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe highlighted the abundance of no-code tools as a reason founders have fewer excuses not to start. \u201cIf you figure out how to launch, I believe you have a business, and then the conversation can begin,\u201d he said.\n\nThe third strategy Aboyeji outlined is for founders to contribute to the startup ecosystem actively.\n\n\u201cWhen we see people giving back to the ecosystem, whether by mentoring others, sharing resources, or leading initiatives, it shows us their ability to lead beyond just their startup,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe noted that founders who engage with their peers and the ecosystem often attract top talent and gain a reputation for leadership.\n\n\u201cLeadership isn\u2019t about calling yourself a CEO. It\u2019s about how you work with your peers and contribute to the ecosystem. These are the founders who tend to succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the chat, Future Africa\u2019s founder noted the importance of fostering healthier relationships between founders and investors, likening the relationship to a marriage.\n\n\u201cWhether you like it or not, you\u2019re tied to each other for a long time, sometimes 10 years or more,\u201d he said. He encouraged founders to see investors as more than just sources of funding.\n\n\u201cMoney is just one part of the relationship,\u201d he noted. \u201cA good investor brings mentorship, networks, and support. But the relationship should always focus on what truly matters, the business.\u201d\n\nHe advised early-stage founders that trust is earned through consistent actions, a willingness to lead, and a proactive approach to execution.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s not just about the money. It is about building something meaningful together,\u201d he added.\n\nShare"
