            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nConnecticut police officer Robert Klein, a 25-year law enforcement veteran, says he had a UFO encounter that was like something straight out of a movie. He told his wild story to Ashleigh Banfield on her show last week.\n\nKlein explained to Banfield that in April 2022 an intense, glowing light filled his police car, changed colors, and flew through the air at speeds that defied the laws of physics as we know them. He says he got a good look at the UFO, and it was a \u201cperfect sphere\u201d about the size of a Mini Cooper as it hovered just 30 feet from his vehicle.\n\nThe UFO encounter occurred on a dark stretch of road near a local reservoir in Fairfield County, Connecticut about 40 minutes into his shift.\n\nKlein claims the UFO had a \u201cplasma-like\u201d look to it and its color changed between red, green, white, and orange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen my fair share of drones and meteors,\u201d Klein told Banfield. \u201cThis was something I\u2019ve never come across before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a really strong light. It lit up the entire cab of my cruiser to the point where I was having a hard time driving because I really couldn\u2019t see,\u201d Klein continued. \u201cI was blinded by it.\n\n\u201cSo I immediately put [his car] into park, rolled down the window and blocked the light with my hand because it was very intense to see where it was coming from and what exactly it was. At that point the lights started to move along the left side of the cruiser. So it stopped right in front, off to the left. As I looked up, that\u2019s when I saw this object.\u201d\n\nHe says the UFO emitted \u201ca low hum, which was very distinct.\u201d When he trained his car\u2019s spotlight on the UFO it made an \u201cinstantaneous\u201d movement and flew across the water at an extremely high rate of speed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I sort of snapped out of it and took out my camera and started recording and taking pictures,\u201d Klein explained. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see it go from A to B, that\u2019s how fast it moved.\u201d\n\nRoss Coulthart, an Australian investigative journalist and author who believes governments are covering up their knowledge of UFOs, was later asked to address Officer Klein\u2019s claims on another show which aired on NewsNation.\n\n\u201cIn this case we have a very senior police officer, a man of high credit who\u2019s worked for his community for 25 years,\u201d Coulthart very validly pointed out. \u201cWhy would he expose himself to public vilification and ridicule, or at least the risk thereof, by speaking about UFOs?\u201d"

Who knows. But we do know that the truth is out there.\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster. com/wordplay/words-were- watching-uap\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/ newsround/57344606\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/ what-are-uaps-unexplained- aerial-phenomenon-ufos-new- name/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/ caileygleeson/2024/03/08/ pentagon-probe-finds-no- evidence-of-extraterrestrial- visits-technology/"

            "article_content": "Have you ever wondered when you\u2019ll die? Well, a new app called Death Clock aims to help you answer that question. The app uses trained death prediction AI, which looks at various answers provided by the app\u2019s users. The AI then predicts when you\u2019ll die, as well as offers some additional ways to improve your health and live longer.\n\nConsidering how important the quest to slow human aging has become for many scientists, the actual want for an app like this is pretty high. Additionally, the information could help elderly people who are worried about outliving their money, the folks behind it told Bloomberg. Being able to more accurately determine when they might reach the end of the road is important.\n\nThe big thing with this new death prediction AI is that the app it powers is supposedly a \u201cpretty significant\u201d improvement on the current standard life tables that we utilize to determine mortality estimates.\n\nThe app\u2019s questionnaire asks many questions about the user, including things like age, gender, family history, mental health, and even information about chronic conditions. The studies it was trained on also included more than 50 million participants, so it should have a nice baseline to build off of.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nHowever, the real meat of the app is locked behind a $40 subscription fee\u2014which could be a turnoff for many, especially as this is where it hides the various suggestions for improving your habits. Subscribing will also show you a clock that counts down to your estimated death, in case you want to let the death prediction AI make things even more morbid than they already might be.\n\nWhether or not this kind of app is for you is up to you to decide. While I can definitely see the appeal of knowing how your health conditions and all might affect your mortality, I\u2019m also of the mind that I\u2019d rather not have a clock counting down to the day I\u2019m going to die\u2014even if it is just a rough estimate. That\u2019s a bit too morbid for me to think about consistently. But, if you do want to know when you\u2019re going to die, Death Clock can tell you."

Talking to Dermot O'Leary on his Audible podcast, he said: 'I wish it was a little bit more interesting.\n\n'A lot of the time it feels like they don't take risks any more, which they used to.\n\nIn July, it was reported that Jonathan could be set for a BBC comeback as he is reportedly in talks for to take part in the celebrity spin-off of The Traitors\n\nAn insider said: 'Jonathan is the ideal target for producers because he's a high-profile celebrity who doesn't regularly appear on the reality TV circuit'\n\nJonathan previously claimed the BBC has become more risk-averse and dull in the wake of his Sachsgate scandal on Radio 2. Pictured are Brand and Ross singing an apology for Sachsgate\n\n'Obviously I'm part of the reason they don't do that any more because of the huge cock-up of me and Russell on his show.\n\n'It's one of the reasons they allowed themselves to be beaten back into a position of, 'Oh, don't take risks, don't take chances.\n\n'To an extent I sympathise with that, but at the same time that's why I don't listen to a lot.'\n\nDespite the public outcry over what became known as Sachsgate \u2013 which was even discussed in Parliament \u2013 Ross did not consider walking away from the broadcaster, claiming the issue had been 'blown out of all proportion'.\n\nRecalling the incident, Jonathan added: 'I didn't want the people who were going for me and going for Russell to win. That would have been their victory.\n\n'I didn't want to throw anyone under the bus, but after the recording I actually said, 'You know you can't put that out unless we have his [Sachs's] permission? You've got to make sure\u2026' That's why the BBC couldn't fire me.'\n\nSachs, who died in 2016 aged 86, said that the pair's 'lewd banter was deeply hurtful'."

            "article_content": "Dandadan has recently become a hot topic in the anime scene, as it has become a standout for its unique blend of paranormal thrills, alien encounters, and quirky high school drama. At its heart are Okarun and Momo, two misfit teens brought together by bullies, bound by their opposing beliefs in aliens and spirits, and thrown into a world where the line between reality and the supernatural blurs.\n\nDandadan | Credit: Science SARU\n\nAside from Yukinobu Tatsu\u2019s masterful storytelling, the creative brilliance of the entire team \u2014 whether it\u2019s Japanese or Western, can\u2019t be overlooked. Among them, A.J. Beckles and Abby Trott\u2019s portrayal of Okarun and Momo, respectively, has particularly resonated with the global audience for their nuance and charm in voice acting. However, perhaps, the most fascinating thing is Beckles\u2019 admiration for Stranger Things, as they have a significant contribution to Okarun\u2019s portrayal in Dandadan.\n\nShaping Okarun and Momo from Dandadan: A.J. Beckles and Abby Trott\u2019s Insights\n\nAfter their panel at Anime NYC, A.J. Beckles, and Abby Trott sat down for an interview with Screenrant, shedding light on their creative process and the inspirations that shaped their performances. For Beckles, voicing Okarun meant stepping into the shoes of a high schooler whose unshakable belief in aliens drives much of the story\u2019s early tension. But Beckles\u2019 connection to the character runs deeper than just the script of Dandadan.\n\nMomo and Okarun from Dandadan | Credit: Science SARU\n\nIn the interview, Beckles referenced his childhood fascination with aliens and the mysteries of space. He cited shows like Ancient Aliens and Ghostbusters, as well as Stranger Things, as significant influences on his approach, stating,\n\nIt reminded me of Stranger Things, Ghostbusters, but growing up, I loved space. I watched shows about aliens on the History channel. I was a little nerd for that too, like Ancient Aliens, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Ancient Egypt?\u201d\n\nWhile Beckles drew from his love of sci-fi, Abby Trott found inspiration in her previous work. She compared Momo to Junichi, a character she voiced in Gamera: Rebirth. Both characters share an interest in the paranormal, often seen engrossed in niche sci-fi magazines. This prior experience gave Trott a head start in understanding the theme of Dandadan\u2018s world.\n\nTrott pointed out how Japan\u2019s culture of sci-fi magazines and supernatural lore adds a layer of authenticity to Momo\u2019s character, as in her eyes, \u201cMomo is interesting\u201d. For Trott, voicing Momo meant finding a balance between the character\u2019s headstrong determination and the emotional depth that makes her so relatable.\n\nDandadan\u2018s Spectacular Moments According to A.J. Beckles and Abby Trott\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of Dandadan is the dynamic between Okarun and Momo. Beckles and Trott worked hard to ensure their chemistry came through in their performances. Beckles highlighted how Okarun\u2019s earnestness often clashes with Momo\u2019s more grounded perspective, creating moments of humor, conflict, and eventual mutual respect.\n\nOkarun from Dandadan | Credit: Science SARU\n\nBeckles particularly emphasized the importance of episodes 2 and 3, which were even showcased in theaters. However, Trott remained tight-lipped about spoilers but at the same time assured fans that the villains in the early episodes are \u201cso interesting and unique\u201d.\n\nBoth actors also raved about the anime\u2019s music, with Trott praising the blend of traditional Enka vibes with modern lo-fi beats in Dandadan. The soundtrack has not only enhanced the series\u2019 tone but also reflects the quirky, genre-bending nature of Yukinobu Tatsu\u2018s story itself.\n\nRelated Dandadan is Guilty of Abusing the Same Strategy That Started With KonoSuba and Jujutsu Kaisen\n\nAs the series continues to unfold, one thing is clear: Dandadan isn\u2019t just a story about aliens and ghosts, it\u2019s about finding connection and strength in the most unexpected places. And with Beckles and Trott at the helm of voicing two of the main leads, the series promises to be as heartfelt as it is thrilling.\n\nDandadan is currently available to watch on Crunchyroll.\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "An idea of an ethics code appears to have riven the Supreme Court, marking the folly of an effort to bind the Nine that was ill-conceived from the get-go. For the court\u2019s critics \u2014 largely Democrats ruing Roe v. Wade \u2014 no code, not even Hammurabi\u2019s, would be draconian enough to hem in a court with a conservative tilt. That makes it all the more shocking that the liberal justices have joined this effort to mortgage the court\u2019s independence.\n\nA report of division among the sages comes from the Times. It reckons that disagreement has broken out over whether the Code of Conduct adopted by the court last year is remiss in not including an enforcement mechanism \u2014 likely lower court judges who would sit in judgment of their superiors. Justice Neil Gorsuch, the Times relates, was \u201cespecially vocal in opposing any enforcement mechanism beyond voluntary compliance.\u201d\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito also oppose a move toward compelled enforcement. The Times reports they see the \u201ccourt\u2019s critics as politically motivated and unappeasable.\u201d They should know. The two have borne the brunt of the left\u2019s outrage, and know whereof they speak. The Times says that \u201call three liberals \u2014 Justices Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson \u2014 supported enforcement.\u201d Justice Kagan appears especially frantic.\n\nIn public remarks in September the justice floated the idea that district and circuit court judges \u201cwould be assigned the task of dealing with complaints about our behavior,\u201d meaning that of the Nine. She also broke new ground \u2014 not good turf, we reckon \u2014 when for the first time she appended to a notice of recusal a reference to the Code of Conduct for United States Judges \u2014 which binds all federal judges but not the justices.\n\nThis space has acknowledged Justice Kagan\u2019s qualities as a jurist. \u201cChief Justice Kagan\u201d has a convincing ring to it. All the more baffling, then, that she would contemplate having the highest court \u2014 the only court established in the Constitution itself \u2014 bound by ones that convened at the command of Congress. As legal scholar Joshua Blackman put it to our A.R. Hoffman: \u201cThere is a reason the Supreme Court justices sit at the top of the pyramid.\u201d\n\nThe Times discloses that Justice Gorsuch was so troubled by an ethics code slicing into the court\u2019s sovereignty that he authored a memorandum \u201craising questions and cautions\u201d that exceeded 10 pages. The first draft of that code was prepared by \u201cJudge Robert M. Dow Jr., a staff member who advises the chief justice.\u201d We harbor no ill will toward Judge Dow, but note that he was not confirmed by the Senate, nor is his tenure for a lifetime.\n\nThe interest of the court\u2019s liberals in more supervision occurs amid the Democratic scheme to reshape the high court in more drastic ways \u2014 a push that Trump\u2019s electoral victory has likely halted, at least for now. Best be careful, though. Both President Biden and Vice President Harris support action to end lifetime tenure and cripple the court in respect of immunity. It appears their cause now has support within the chambers."

            "article_content": "A previously undocumented threat activity cluster dubbed Earth Minotaur is leveraging the MOONSHINE exploit kit and an unreported Android-cum-Windows backdoor called DarkNimbus to facilitate long-term surveillance operations targeting Tibetans and Uyghurs.\n\n\"Earth Minotaur uses MOONSHINE to deliver the DarkNimbus backdoor to Android and Windows devices, targeting WeChat, and possibly making it a cross-platform threat,\" Trend Micro researchers Joseph C Chen and Daniel Lunghi said in an analysis published today.\n\n\"MOONSHINE exploits multiple known vulnerabilities in Chromium-based browsers and applications, requiring users to update software regularly to prevent attacks.\"\n\nCountries affected by Earth Minotaur's attacks span Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Nepal, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, and the U.S.\n\nMOONSHINE first came to light in September 2019 as part of cyber attacks targeting the Tibetan community, with the Citizen Lab attributing its use to an operator it tracks under the moniker POISON CARP, which overlaps with threat groups Earth Empusa and Evil Eye.\n\nAn Android-based exploit kit, it's known to make use of various Chrome browser exploits with an aim to deploy payloads that can siphon sensitive data from compromised devices. Particularly, it incorporates code to target various applications like Google Chrome, Naver, and instant messaging apps like LINE, QQ, WeChat, and Zalo that embed an in-app browser.\n\nEarth Minotaur, per Trend Micro, has no direct connections to Earth Empusa. Primarily targeting Tibetan and Uyghur communities, the threat actor has been found to use an upgraded version of MOONSHINE to infiltrate victim devices and subsequently infect them with DarkNimbus.\n\nThe new variant adds to its exploit arsenal CVE-2020-6418, a type confusion vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript engine that Google patched in February 2020 following reports that it had been weaponized as a zero-day.\n\n\"Earth Minotaur sends carefully crafted messages via instant messaging apps to entice victims to click an embedded malicious link,\" the researchers said. \"They disguise themselves as different characters on chats to increase the success of their social engineering attacks.\"\n\nThe phony links lead to one of at least 55 MOONSHINE exploit kit servers that take care of installing the DarkNimbus backdoor on the target's devices.\n\nIn a clever attempt at deception, these URLs masquerade as seemingly innocuous links, pretending to be China-related announcements or those related to online videos of Tibetans' or Uyghurs' music and dances.\n\n\"When a victim clicks on an attack link and is redirected to the exploit kit server, it reacts based on the embedded settings,\" Trend Micro said. \"The server will redirect the victim to the masqueraded legitimate link once the attack is over to keep the victim from noticing any unusual activity.\"\n\nIn situations where the Chromium-based Tencent browser is not susceptible to any of the exploits supported by MOONSHINE, the kit server is configured to return a phishing page that alerts the WeChat user that the in-app browser (a custom version of Android WebView called XWalk) is out of date and needs to be updated by clicking on a provided download link.\n\nThis results in a browser engine downgrade attack, thereby allowing the threat actor to take advantage of the MOONSHINE framework by exploiting the unpatched security flaws.\n\nA successful attack causes a trojanized version of XWalk to be implanted on the Android device and replace its legitimate counterpart within the WeChat app, ultimately paving the way for the execution of DarkNimbus.\n\nBelieved to have been developed and actively updated since 2018, the backdoor uses the XMPP protocol to communicate with an attacker-controlled server and supports an exhaustive list of commands to hoover valuable information, including device metadata, screenshots, browser bookmarks, phone call history, contacts, SMS messages, geolocation, files, clipboard content, and a list of installed apps.\n\nIt's also capable of executing shell commands, recording phone calls, taking pictures, and abusing Android's accessibility services permissions to collect messages from DingTalk, MOMO, QQ, Skype, TalkBox, Voxer, WeChat, and WhatsApp. Last but not least, it can uninstall itself from the infected phone.\n\nTrend Micro said it also detected a Windows version of DarkNimbus that was likely put together between July and October 2019 but only used more than a year later in December 2020.\n\nIt lacks many of the features of its Android variant, but incorporates a wide range of commands to gather system information, the list of installed apps, keystrokes, clipboard data, saved credentials and history from web browsers, as well as read and upload file content.\n\nEven though the exact origins of Earth Minotaur are presently unclear, the diversity in the observed infection chains combined with highly capable malware tools leaves no doubt that this is a sophisticated threat actor.\n\n\"MOONSHINE is a toolkit that is still under development and has been shared with multiple threat actors including Earth Minotaur, POISON CARP, UNC5221, and others,\" Trend Micro theorized."
