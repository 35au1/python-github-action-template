        "article_content": "Over the last two years, Congressional hearings on UFOs have introduced new terms to the popular vernacular. From hearings on Navy pilots who spotted a \u201cTic-Tac\u201d UFO in 2004, we got the term \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d (UAP). Then reports of strange objects hovering above the ocean gave us \u201cUnidentified Submerged Objects\u201d (USOs).\n\nNow, believers and skeptics alike can add another new bit of vocabulary to the debate around these bizarre happenings, which may tie them all together: \u201cImmaculate Constellation.\u201d\n\nDuring last week\u2019s UAP hearings on Capitol Hill, multiple witnesses described the elaborately named program as an alleged information-gathering and evidence-retrieval program conducted by the Pentagon without Congressional oversight. The Immaculate Constellation program, they say, has been withholding a treasure trove of high-resolution images and other data about UAP sightings from the public for decades.\n\nThe November 13 hearings followed up on the June 2023 Congressional event in which retired Navy Comm. David Fravor and fellow pilot Lt. Comm. Alex Dietrich described how their F/A-18 Hornets spotted and chased a white \u201cTic-Tac\u201d-shaped UAP for several minutes. According to analysis of radar tracks and grainy infrared video shot by the F/A-18s, the object displayed speeds of more than 45,000 miles per hour and pulled more than 2,000 Gs.\n\nJump ahead to 2024, and a new crop of believers have come forward about the function of Immaculate Constellation\u2014gathering reports of major UAP sightings and possible encounters; investigating possible crash or landing sites; and gathering physical UAP evidence, biological material, or technology.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. military and intelligence community are sitting on a huge amount of visual and other information\u2014still photos, video photos, other sensor information\u2014and they have for a very long time,\u201d said journalist Michael Shellenberger, one of the witnesses at the November 13 hearing. Meanwhile, the public has only ever seen fuzzy photos of some of those incidents.\n\nShellenberger delivered an 11-page report to Congress during the hearing, detailing claims about Immaculate Constellation; he says a current or former official and UAP whistleblower authored the report.\n\nThe November testimony lineup also included one-time Air Force Intelligence officer David Grusch\u2014who claimed during a prior hearing last summer that crashed UAPs had not only been recovered and studied for reverse-engineering, but that \u201cnon-human biologics\u201d had also been discovered inside\u2014and Lue Elizondo, who formerly headed the Pentagon\u2019s secretive UFO unit.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: UAP are real,\u201d Elizondo said in his opening testimony. \u201cAdvanced technologies not made by our government\u2014or any other government\u2014are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe. Furthermore, the U.S. is in possession of UAP technologies, as are some of our adversaries.\u201d Elizondo says it all adds up to a \u201cmultidecade, secretive arms race.\u201d\n\nHowever, skeptics point to the fact that none of the assembled witnesses presented anything by way of physical evidence or direct testimony from the witnesses or whistleblowers referenced. Department of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough stated the Pentagon denies the existence of such a program, while representatives of the U.S. Government agency AARO (All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office) continue to claim there is no evidence that UAPs are alien in nature.\n\nAvi Loeb, Ph.D.\u2014a physicist and professor at Harvard University who heads the Galileo Project, which seeks out alien intelligence or artifacts\u2014acknowledges the possibility of Immaculate Constellation, but highlighted the lack of any real proof. \u201cAll we have seen is written text,\u201d Loeb says. \u201cNo credible scientific evidence was made public.\u201d\n\nLoeb says his firm belief is that all major nations have programs to \u201cimage or retrieve relics from crash sites.\u201d However, he insists the purpose of such programs is to learn about technologies developed by adversarial nations and manage reverse-engineering efforts to reproduce such technologies.\n\n\u201cThere might also be biologics in such crash sites if the equipment carried pilots,\u201d he added. \u201cThe fundamental question is whether some of the data collected by these programs indicates an extraterrestrial technological origin. If such data exists, I would love to see it and help the Department of Defense or the Intelligence agencies figure out what it means.\u201d\n\nLoeb generally questions the usefulness of the ongoing series of congressional hearings, stressing that it is unlikely any meaningful admissions will come from the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cThe Galileo Project Observatory at Harvard University released its first commissioning data on half a million objects that it monitored in the sky over five months,\u201d Loeb says. \u201cWe also retrieved materials from the crash site of the first interstellar meteor in the Pacific Ocean.\u201d\n\nLoeb promises his team will openly share with the public any data they collect and any discoveries they make.\n\n\u201cThis standard scientific practice is far more informative than political maneuvers aimed to disclose classified information from stubborn government agencies,\u201d he says. \u201cA robust answer to Enrico Fermi\u2019s old question of \u2018where is everybody?\u2019 will originate from scientists\u2014not from politicians or journalists.\u201d"

Schaefer said most of the envisaged job cuts at the German carmaker, which the group has not quantified, could be done via normal attrition and early retirement, adding however that this would not be enough."

CoAgent\u2019s Agentic Generative UI creates dynamic, AI-generated interfaces that adapt to user needs and agent outputs, providing visibility into the agent\u2019s state and building trust.\n\nIf you like the features stated earlier, you might want to consider using CoAgents for your business, let us see how to do that.\n\nBuild AI CoAgents or apps powered by Copilot\n\nFollow the steps below to build AI CoAgents or apps powered by Copilot.\n\nInstall CopilotKit Configure Remote Backend Endpoint Add LangGraph agent\n\nLet us talk about them in detail.\n\n1] Install CopilotKit\n\nBefore we begin with CoAgents, we need to first install CopilotKit on your device. We are presumming that you have already installed Node.js and npm on your computer and have created a folder for React applications, however, the last part is optional for this step. CopilotKit uses an open source LLM model, in this tutorial we will be using OpenAI API key. Without further ado, let\u2019s get started.\n\nOpen Windows Terminal and go to the location where you have created the React app using cd (change directory) command.\n\ncd C:\\React\\myapplication\n\nNow, run the following command.\n\nnpm install @copilotkit/react-core @copilotkit/react-ui @copilotkit/runtime\n\nThen, execute the command mentioned below to install OpenAI.\n\nnpm install openai\n\nIn your project, go to the .eve file, it will be located in the root, and add the following line.\n\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n\nAfter making changes to the file, we recommend you navigate to docs.copilot.ai/quickstart to know how to configure the End Point and configure CopilotKit provider in your project.\n\n2] Configure Remote Backend Endpoint\n\nIn order to integrate Python-based services (or any other Node.js alternative), we have to connect Copilot app to a Remote Backend endpoint. To do that, let us first install Copilot dependencies in Windows Terminal using the following query.\n\npip install copilotkit fastapi uvicorn --extra-index-url https://copilotkit.gateway.scarf.sh/simple/\n\nNow, we need to setup FastAI server, to do that, run the commands mentioned below.\n\nmkdir my_copilotkit_remote_endpoint\n\ncd my_copilotkit_remote_endpoint\n\necho. > server.py\n\nIf the echo didn\u2019t work, you can open the folder in Visual Studio Code, and then create server.py file.\n\nOpen the server.py file in VSCode and then paste the following lines of code.\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n\nNow, go back to Windows Terminal and install FastAPI and Uvicorn.\n\npip install fastapi uvicorn\n\nOnce you are done with that, go to docs.copilot.ai guides to learn more.\n\n3] Add LangGraph agent\n\nNext up, we need to integrate LangGraph agent to the server.py file. First, locate the CopilotKitSDK instance within your Python Remote Endpoint, usually found in server.py. Next, adjust the CopilotKitSDK instance (established in the preceding step) to accommodate LangGraph agents. You need to add the following lines of code.\n\nagents=[ LangGraphAgent( name=\"basic_agent\", description=\"Agent that answers questions about the weather\", graph=the_langraph_graph, # copilotkit_config={ # if you use Google Gemini, uncomment this code (and import `copilotkit_messages_to_langchain`, see above) # \"convert_messages\": copilotkit_messages_to_langchain(use_function_call=True) # } ) ],\n\nThis should be enclosed under CopilotKitSDK tag.\n\nTo know more, we recommend you follow the guide mentioned in docs.copilotkit.ai/coagents.\n\nRead: What are best free AI Extensions for Visual Studio Code?\n\nHow do I build my own Copilot?\n\nTo create a new copilot, go to the Copilot Studio home page (at /copilotstudio.microsoft.com) and select Create in the left navigation, then choose the Copilots page. Alternatively, you can select + New copilot on the Copilots page. Use the chat to describe your copilot, guided by the provided questions, or select Skip to configure and fill out the form. Finally, select \u201cCreate\u201d to complete the process.\n\nRead: Best AI tools for Developers\n\nCan Copilot generate code?\n\nYes, Copilot can generate code. However, it can not be perfect; there can be multiple glitches and bugs. Therefore, one should not integrate the code provided by any AI chatbot without thorough manual inspections. You can use Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in Edge, the built-in app or use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio using extension.\n\nAlso Read: Use Copilot to Refractor Code."

        "article_content": "The creators of The Room are preparing to launch a new spooky VR game. And fans couldn\u2019t be more excited. The trailer already shows good promise, as is the overall concept for the upcoming game. Fireproof Games have already proven themselves to be highly creative in coming up with engaging puzzles. Perhaps the same level of ingenuity will go into the new game, in addition to the immersive nature of virtual reality. Here\u2019s everything we know so far about Ghost Town.\n\nWhat is Ghost Town?\n\nGhost Town is an upcoming single-player VR puzzle adventure game. It\u2019ll take you to London in 1983, following a ghost hunter named Edith Penrose. She\u2019s been the go-to exorcist and ghost hunter of the town, which, having been named a ghost town, must be rampant with lots of deadly spirits. However, trouble hits close to home when Penrose\u2019s brother disappears. And now, she must muster her ghost-hunting skills and knowledge of the paranormal to uncover the mystery behind his disappearance and bring him back home.\n\nStory\n\nGhost Town is an actual town plagued by supernatural wonders. Its story is about the mysterious disappearance of your brother. Thankfully, your job has been working as a ghost hunter in a paranormal detective agency, which you manage with your flatmate. Of late, you\u2019ve been busy solving cases that have helped pay the bills. Steam also mentions dealing with some \u201cghosts in your bathroom mirror,\u201d which have become less haunting.\n\nTables turn, though, when your brother goes missing. So, you set out chasing leads that lead you down even more twisted paths. You enlist the help of other professionals, one of which is a gifted clairvoyant based in a remote Scottish island. And with each step into the unknown, you uncover damning secrets and mysteries, culminating in a captivating adventure.\n\nGameplay\n\nAs a single-player VR puzzle adventure game, exploration will be at the center stage of your gameplay. You\u2019ll take advantage of virtual reality to explore various areas in the first person. These will all be steeped in an alluring atmospheric vibe. Mechanically, you\u2019ll use your controller and carry a torch to see through the dark.\n\nWhile exploring, Ghost Town will introduce new characters. Some will be alive from the real world and reveal new information about the story. Others, however, will be dead spirits that add compelling secrets that further explain the hauntings that have been occurring.\n\nThe Room fans will be happy to know that there will be puzzles to solve, likely just as intricate and engaging. This time, you\u2019ll use your hands' dexterity to break out of tactile puzzles. Additionally, you can also cast spells and even summon restless spirits to transition them from the real world into the afterlife.\n\nKey Features\n\nAmong the features you can expect include:\n\nVirtual reality \u2013 Ghost Town plans to deliver an atmospheric trip down an authentic sense of realism and intricate puzzles to solve.\n\nDiverse locations \u2013 Lots of exciting locations await discovery and exploration.\n\nCompelling story \u2013 You\u2019ll unravel a rich story complete with exciting characters to interact with.\n\nVR comfort \u2013 Thanks to multiple settings, you can fine-tune your VR experience exactly how you like it.\n\n3D audio \u2013 You can look forward to spooky vibes best relayed via spatial 3D sound effects that are both dynamic and immerse you in the adventure.\n\nLanguages \u2013 Ghost Town will have translations from English to French, Italian, German, and Spanish.\n\nDevelopment\n\nDeveloper Fireproof Games is currently working on Ghost Town. They\u2019ll be publishing the game, too, once it's ready. You probably know the studio from their highly successful work in The Room series. It\u2019s an escape room puzzle game that first hit iOS platforms and became an instant hit. Since then, the studio has released five titles that have all received mostly positive reviews.\n\nFireproof Games itself is a small indie studio operating out of Guildford, UK. The studio has been working on Ghost Town for the past four years now. It\u2019s great that the studio has taken the time to work on a new franchise. Hopefully, the final product will be just as good as The Room or possibly even surpass its praises.\n\nTrailer\n\nGhost Town - Teaser Trailer\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nCheck out Ghost Town\u2019s official teaser trailer, which was launched on YouTube. Right off the bat, the visuals stand out. Fireproof has really outdone itself, crafting a deeply spooky and atmospheric environment. The trailer is also well done, building on suspense and mystery to an invigorating close.\n\nYou\u2019re operating your ghost-hunting business from the premises of a particularly impatient landlord. And when the landlord can\u2019t take any more of the haunting noises and creepy sounds coming from your flat, he gives you a piece of his mind. But you have bigger fish to fry with some nightmarish creatures emerging from your bathroom wall.\n\nOverall, the graphics are fantastic in capturing an eerie and atmospheric vibe. They seem to dwell more on the spooky front than the horrific extreme. It\u2019s also unclear at the moment what kind of puzzles you\u2019ll be solving. Still, the trailer is an excellent first look at what\u2019s to come, and we can\u2019t wait for even more updates ahead of the launch.\n\nRelease Date, Platforms, & Editions\n\nGhost Town will be coming soon. Rumors have it that the launch window will fall sometime in 2025. However, official confirmation remains unclear. In the meantime, you can always add the game to your wishlist, either via Steam, PlayStation, or Meta Quest. That way, you can receive a notification as soon as the game drops.\n\nSimilarly, Fireproof confirms the upcoming game will be a virtual reality title that will launch on Meta Quest 1 and 2, PlayStation VR 2, and Steam VR. As for the editions, they remain under wraps for now. Yet you can always keep track of new announcements on the official social media handle here while also checking out updates on the game\u2019s website here.\n\nSo, what\u2019s your take? Will you be grabbing a copy of Ghost Town when it drops? Let us know over on our socials here."
