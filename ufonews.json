Sign up here to get our Paranormal PA newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nBy all accounts, Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s life is pretty sweet.\n\nHe\u2019s immortal. He\u2019s got a great wife and kids. And his only job requirement is going outside once a year.\n\nBut before anyone poo-poos what many view as one of Pennsylvania\u2019s \u2014 or, indeed, the country\u2019s \u2014 more bizarre traditions, Paranormal Pa. will have you know that Phil is a product of a storied tradition (and superstition) that stretches back for years and years.\n\nGerman immigrants brought the tradition over when they settled in Pennsylvania hundreds of years ago. (AP Photo/Barry Reeger)AP\n\nThe Punsutawney Groundhog Club explains how the first time \u201cWeather Wags\u201d recognized Groundhog Day was in 1886, although the first official trek to Gobbler\u2019s Knob was the following year.\n\nBut the concept of having animals predict the weather goes way back before the 19th century. According to the Library of Congress Blogs, Groundhog Day\u2019s lineage can be traced back to ancient pre-Christian festivals celebrated by the Celts that served as midway points between equinoxes. Halloween \u2014 originally Samhain \u2014 falls into this category, too.\n\nFormerly known as \u201cImbolc\u201d before it eventually became the Christianized Candlemas, Groundhog Day was once considered the first day of spring. And while little is known about how the Celts celebrated the day, one traditional practice was attempting to divine the weather.\n\nNow, here\u2019s how animals figure into this: Ancient people used to observe animal behavior as part of their own farming practices, so the idea of watching how a groundhog to see whether or not spring was on its way makes sense.\n\nVisitPa.com adds how Roman legions, in their conquest of northern Europe, eventually spread the Candelmas Day tradition of candles being blessed and distributed. Those living in what\u2019s now Germany soon began to believe that if the sun made an appearance on the day, an animal who cast his shadow would predict six more weeks of cruddy weather.\n\nGroundhog Club President Tom Dunkel taps on the immortal groundhog's door so the weather oracle can make his prediction. (AP Photo/Barry Reeger)AP\n\nIn his book \u201cGroundhog Day (2003),\u201d Dan Yoder writes how the Germans who brought this tradition over to the U.S. used to watch badgers to see how far away spring was (the German folk expression for the holiday was \u201cDachstag,\u201d or \u201cBadger Day\u201d). Then somewhere along the line, that badger became a groundhog.\n\nNot to say that early Groundhog Day celebrations in Pennsylvania didn\u2019t maintain a bit of their mysticism: Yoder describes late 19th century celebrations of involving ritualized Groundhog Hunts in September which drew in \u201cdevotees from Pittsburgh and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nOne parade in 1909, as staged by the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, was deemed \u201cthe Circumgyratory Pageant of the Astrologers, Horoscopists, Magicians, Soothsayers, and Meteorological Attach\u00e9s of Punxsutawney Weather Works.\u201d A man named Clymer Freas \u2014 credited as conceiving of the idea for the holiday \u2014 even created \u201cGroundhogese,\u201d the language Groundhog Club presidents learn in order to discern the groundhog\u2019s annual predictions.\n\nThere may not be any more astrologists or soothsayers involved, but Groundhog Day remains a celebration: More than 30,000 people from across the globe drop by Knobbler\u2019s Creek on the day, getting up at the crack of dawn in the dead of winter to watch Phil make his prediction.\n\nTo be fair, though, even back in the day, people raised their eyebrows at the idea of watching a rodent predict how much longer winter would last.\n\n\u201cIn consequence, probably of having given all spiritual matters to the exclusive supervision of the clergy, newspaper editors are somewhat skeptical about many things which are popularly accepted with absolute faith,\u201d read an 1876 edition of the Harrisburg Daily Patriot.\n\n\u201cThis may account for the reason that some of them have failed to appreciate the sentiment\u2026in favor of a legal recognition of Ground Hog Day.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, editorial skepticism be damned, Groundhog Day won out, and did, indeed, spawn an industry. And inspired a Bill Murray movie. And tons of Punxsutawney wannabes like Staten Island Chuck, who did, it should be noted, tragically lost his life after former New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio quite literally fumbled him (never forget).\n\nYes, the holiday has come very far from its very old roots. And whether you\u2019re an eyebrow-raiser to the holiday or all-in, it doesn\u2019t look like Groundhog Day is going away any time soon.\n\nThat is, unless PETA has their way."

            "article_content": "In the first three episodes of the second season of Paramount+\u2019s supernatural teen drama series \u2018School Spirits,\u2019 the friends of Maddie Nears search for her without knowing that her body is possessed by Janet Hamilton. In addition, Xavier Baxter, the protagonist\u2019s former boyfriend, is even temporarily transported to the world of the dead. To make sense of what he sees during this short period, he goes through an online discussion portal named \u201cWeird Wisconsin,\u201d on which many talk about their experiences with anything or anyone paranormal. Meanwhile, Claire tries to find Maddie using a social media app named Snapati. They all also use a common internet browser named InQuest!\n\nWeird Wisconsin Does Not Exist in Reality\n\nWeird Wisconsin is a fictional discussion portal based in the Badger State that is dedicated to supernatural entities and paranormal occurrences. In \u2018School Spirits,\u2019 the web address to the portal is \u201chttp://weird-wisconsin.com/.\u201d However, the same won\u2019t lead you to any forum or active website. It is solely created as a part of Xavier\u2019s second-season storyline. However, the name \u201cWeird Wisconsin\u201d reminds us of Linda Godfrey and Richard D. Hendricks\u2019 travel guide with the same title. Originally published in 2005, the book explores some of the myths, legends, and alleged paranormal happenings or figures that shook the state, including Highway 13\u2019s Reptile Man and Madison\u2019s Loony Lawyer.\n\nInterestingly, \u201cWeird Wisconsin\u201d is also the name informally given to a collection of movies made by Bill Rebane, the filmmaker behind \u2018Monster a Go-Go\u2019 and \u2018The Giant Spider Invasion.\u2019 He is also reportedly credited as the creator of the Wisconsin Film Office. As far as the teen drama is concerned, the discussion portal must have been conceived to establish two major developments: Xavier\u2019s introduction to the world of the dead and his communication with Nicole. After his supernatural experience, he becomes more receptive towards Maddie\u2019s predicament, which happens when he reads the discussions in the portal.\n\nFurthermore, the portal also sets the stage for Xavier and Nicole\u2019s chats without them knowing the real identity of their respective chatmate. The bond they build as two anonymous users of Weird Wisconsin may turn out to be integral in the upcoming episodes of the second season.\n\nInQuest and Snapati Do Not Have Real-Life Counterparts\n\nSimilarly, InQuest and Snapati are applications that exist only in the fictional universe of \u2018School Spirits.\u2019 The former can be seen as a carbon copy of Google without even a complete web address. On the other hand, Snapati is, more or less, a clone of Instagram with a similar menu. Its icon, however, reminds us of Shazam rather than a social media application. The production department might have created these fictional apps because of several reasons, including trademark or licensing concerns.\n\nIn reality, an \u201cInQuest\u201d does exist, but it is a cyber security firm that is based in Austin, Texas, and releases products such as FileTAC, MailTAC, and InSights. Needless to say, neither the firm nor its products have any connection with the internet browser in the show. In the case of \u201cSnapati,\u201d the social media app does not even have a namesake connection with real life beyond its inspiration, Instagram. These fictional applications and the discussion portal contribute to the world-building within the narrative of the teen drama series. Even though they cannot be used by viewers, they succeed in leaving an impression among the audiences.\n\nRead More: Why Can Simon See Maddie in School Spirits, Explained"

It is the subject of multiple lawsuits along those lines, including from The New York Times, which claims the company built its model in part by ingesting millions of the newspaper\u2019s stories without permission.\n\nOn Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted a congratulations to DeepSeek on X, saying it had developed \u201can impressive model, particularly around what they\u2019re able to deliver for the price.\u201d\n\nThe OpenAI spokesperson indicated the White House may get involved in the dispute.\n\n\u201cWe take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the U.S. government to protect the most capable models being built here,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump\u2019s AI adviser, David Sacks, told Fox News that he believed DeepSeek did distill from OpenAI, but stopped short of declaring that the White House would take action.\n\n\u201cI think one of the things you\u2019re going to see over the next few months is our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would definitely slow down some of these copycat models.\u201d\n\nBrian Hughes, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in an email to NBC News that the White House was looking into the broader issue but didn't specifically address OpenAI's distillation accusation.\n\n\u201cAt the President\u2019s direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government are working in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security. As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\u201d"

He was reinstated five days later, but OpenAI has lost several prominent employees since then, including Ilya Sutskever, its chief scientist and a co-founder.\n\nIn October, OpenAI completed a $6.6 billion fund-raising deal that valued the company at $157 billion, nearly doubling the high-profile company\u2019s valuation from just nine months earlier. SoftBank was part of that deal.\n\nIn December, OpenAI unveiled new A.I. technology called OpenAI o3. But not long after, a little-known Chinese start-up called DeepSeek shocked the tech industry with the release of an A.I. system that could match leading A.I. products made in the United States.\n\nThe Chinese company said it built its new A.I. technology at a lower price and with fewer hard-to-get computer chips than its American competitors, challenging an industrywide belief that bigger and better A.I. would cost many billions of dollars. OpenAI said on Wednesday that it was investigating whether DeepSeek may have improperly harvested OpenAI\u2019s data to help build its own systems."

The company says these smarter Gemini features are targeted toward small business owners, marketers, or anyone else working with a lot of data in Google Sheets.\n\nSpecifically, Gemini in Sheets can now spot \"contextual trends, patterns, and correlations between different variables in your data\" when you ask it questions via the sidebar. From there, it can create charts from your data automatically when requested. You can insert those charts as images in your Google Sheets document, or use them elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough these features might seem simple, Gemini is doing some impressive work behind the scenes. For complex queries, Gemini is actually converting your written entries into Python code, executing the code, and drawing conclusions based on the result. This is how Gemini in Sheets can now provide multilayered analysis, according to Google.\n\nSimpler Gemini requests might leverage Sheets formulas instead of Python code, but the latter will help for larger and more complex needs. For instance, Google says Gemini in Sheets performs consistently in documents up to one million cells in size.\n\nCredit: Google\n\nTo get the best results, make sure your Gemini prompts are clear and specific. In your document, use consistent formats and organization techniques, like clear headers and complete values. Remember that since graphs generated with Gemini are static images, they won't update when you update your cells.

The speculation surrounding whether the forthcoming Apple iPhone SE 4 will have a notch at the top of its screen, or adopt the Dynamic Island format introduced on the Apple iPhone 14 series, has reached such a ridiculous point, I no longer want to hear about it until the phone is officially revealed.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about it.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWill it or won\u2019t it?\n\nWhat has got me to breaking point? It\u2019s the repeated flip-flopping. One day a report comes out saying the phone will have a notch, and the next there\u2019s another report claiming it\u2019ll have the Dynamic Island. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if it was just two reports spaced by weeks or even months, but instead, it\u2019s multiple reports coming in the space of days, and over a long period of time.\n\nBased on what has been reported to me, the iPhone SE could have a design very similar to that of the current iPhone 16 still in development. The new iPhone SE will most likely have a single camera instead of the double one of the iPhone 16 models, otherwise it seems that the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Z1Gio4nBRu \u2014 Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) February 8, 2024\n\nLet me illustrate it for you. It all traces back to February 2024, when the 4th generation iPhone SE was linked with the iPhone 16\u2019s shape and with the iPhone XR\u2019s dimensions, and the claim was that it would include a pill-shape cutout for the Dynamic Island at the top of the screen. Fast forward to January 28, 2025, after a whole lot of speculation on both sides of the fence, and we\u2019re told the iPhone SE 4 will have a notch.\n\nNotch like iPhone 14 is correct \u2014 Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) January 28, 2025\n\nOver a year we\u2019ve seen multiple conflicting reports and various images and videos, each not really confirming the situation one way or the other, but appearing adamant their conclusion was the correct one. Once 2025 hit, talk of the notch and Dynamic Island reached fever pitch, with snippets of code apparently showing the Dynamic Island, and the source of the original rumor that started it all now saying the phone will have a notch. I know this is how the rumor mill works, but rarely is there such division.\n\nTrusted sources\n\nIt\u2019s not like the reports are solely coming from anonymous sources, or can be marked down as idle speculation by fans. Most come from trusted industry watchers, known insiders, or individuals in the business of leaking details about unreleased devices, and with a good track record for accuracy. This makes it all even more infuriating because I\u2019d usually trust these sources, yet something is clearly amiss here.\n\nNew iPhone models are always hotly anticipated, but the iPhone SE 4 seems to have risen above Apple\u2019s previous SE models in terms of the buzz around it, and it\u2019s surprising to see most of the talk centered on one aspect, and the opinions so opposite. What\u2019s got phone pundits so sweaty and eager to chime in? The Dynamic Island is a delightful way to add functionality to the necessary cutout at the top of the screen and would be a big update for the SE line. However, it\u2019s not what I\u2019d call transformative, and if it wasn\u2019t there I doubt I\u2019d really miss it.\n\nThe notch looks old and has been controversial ever since it made its first appearance on the Essential Phone in 2017 and subsequently on the iPhone X in the same year. Few like the design, a lot hate the design, but most just tolerate it. Today it can be seen as an outdated way of dealing with the multiple cameras and sensors required on the front of our phones, and not an especially attractive one. No one wants the notch, but many expect the notch.\n\nSomeone is wrong\n\nWhat all this means is that the situation could go either way, and that\u2019s the impression we\u2019ve been given by the endless speculation over the last 12 months too. It also means someone out there is wrong.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4, or iPhone 16E depending on what Apple decides to call its next budget model, either has a notch or the Dynamic Island. It can\u2019t have both. Or can it? The Dynamic Island is really a hardware and software solution, enlarging the usable space around the pill-shaped cutout at the top of the iPhone\u2019s screen for features like Live Activities. A notch shapes the screen around a cutout at the top of the device, and the software ignores it entirely. Apple could adapt the Dynamic Island for use with a notch, if the SE 4 ends up using one, technically making everyone right.\n\nThough possible, it\u2019s probably unlikely. We must remember the iPhone SE 4 is Apple\u2019s budget device, and compromises have to be made to keep the cost down. Using up supplies of notched screens would be one way to do it. On the other hand, the Dynamic Island would bring the iPhone SE 4 in-line with the iPhone 16\u2019s design (and presumably, the iPhone 17, but the Dynamic Island seems to be clouding that model too), and adapting the notch to include some of the Dynamic Island\u2019s functionality in iOS would give the SE 4 a \u201cmodern\u201d feature to increase value.\n\nNothing suggesting the iPhone SE 4\u2019s screen will do any of this has been seen in code for beta versions of iOS though, so it\u2019s just speculation on my part.\n\nThe judge rules\n\nThe fact I\u2019m adding my own speculation to the speculation, which can\u2019t agree on the situation anyway, only makes me more angry about the whole thing. The will-it, won\u2019t-it back-and-forth about the iPhone SE 4\u2019s screen has reached the point where nothing new should be added to the conversation unless it has conclusive proof to back it up.\n\nWhether that\u2019s a leaked image of the actual device and not a render or mockup based on code, or Apple officially revealing it during an event, it doesn\u2019t matter. No more speculation, please. We\u2019ve seen and heard the arguments from both sides and now all that\u2019s left is for the judge to rule. I\u2019m the judge here, and I\u2019m throwing the whole thing out because the entire case is based on hearsay.\n\nI don\u2019t care what the iPhone SE 4\u2019s screen looks like anymore, or if it will feature the Dynamic Island or not, and I won\u2019t until Apple shows me."

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nWeb client runtime security (WCRS) refers to the security or behavior of the code executed in users' internet browsers during their web interactions. The first part of this article series includes details of why WCRS as a security discipline warrants specific focus in addition to traditional web application security practices. Traditional approaches to web application security have often focused on scanning code for vulnerabilities, as well as scanning and monitoring for security weaknesses from the perspective of the web hosting provider.\n\nThis second article describes the limitations of traditional security solutions in addressing WCRS risk and proposes implementation options for purpose-built security solutions. Specifically, the strengths and limitations of three key traditional application security mechanisms are covered, before proposing certain viable implementation options for addressing WCRS needs. These mechanisms include static analysis, dynamic analysis, and manual code reviews, each offering unique benefits and challenges in the context of web application security.\n\nStatic Application Security Testing\n\nStatic application security testing (SAST)1 involves analyzing source code for vulnerabilities while the application is being developed or analyzing any code changes that are made to an existing application. This is a traditional approach to code scanning that is utilized by many organizations. SAST can catch many vulnerabilities before applications are released into production. Some vendor products generate a report of potential vulnerabilities. Others go a step further, by scanning code while a developer is typing, and highlighting potential problems in the integrated development environment. After reviewing the vulnerability report produced by one of these tools, developers might go through multiple code remediation and re-scanning cycles until a passing scan is achieved. This approach is beneficial for early vulnerability detection, allowing developers to address issues before the code is deployed. Figure 1 summarizes the pros and cons of SAST.\n\nFigure 1 \u2014 Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Considerations\n\n\n\nHowever, SAST does not account for runtime behaviors or interactions with dynamically loaded scripts, which are common in modern web applications. As a result, vulnerabilities introduced through third-party scripts or supply chain attacks can go undetected. SAST tools are designed to assess code as it is written, not as it is executed in the varied web application environments, limiting their effectiveness in addressing WCRS threats.\n\nStrengths\u2014SAST analyzes source code for vulnerabilities, offering early detection during the development phase.\n\nLimitations\u2014SAST does not cover runtime behaviors or interactions with dynamically loaded scripts. It may also not detect vulnerabilities introduced through third-party scripts or supply chain attacks.\n\nDynamic Application Security Testing\n\nDynamic application security testing (DAST)2 involves testing applications in their running state and simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities. This method provides insights into application behavior while under attack and can uncover issues that static analysis might miss. Many organizations supplement their SAST processes with DAST because DAST scans can detect vulnerabilities in the deployed environment, which would not be evident from reviewing application code. Server misconfigurations, weak authentication, and security headers are some examples of vulnerabilities detected by DAST scans. The pros and cons of DAST are depicted in figure 2.\n\nFigure 2 \u2014 Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Considerations\n\n\n\nDAST has its limitations, particularly in detecting vulnerabilities that manifest only in specific web client runtime environments. Malicious code can evade DAST by activating only under certain conditions that the testing environment does not replicate. Additionally, DAST cannot fully understand and evaluate the behavior of third-party scripts, rendering it less effective against the threats that exploit these external dependencies. Last, DAST scans are detective by nature, offering few preventive capabilities that would protect organizations during supply chain attacks at runtime.\n\nStrengths\u2014DAST tests applications in their running state, simulating real-world attacks.\n\nLimitations\u2014DAST might miss vulnerabilities that only manifest in specific web client runtime environments. Malicious code can hide from DAST by only executing in specific user contexts, and DAST does not provide real-time protection from unwanted script behavior.\n\nInteractive Application Security Testing\n\nInteractive application security testing (IAST)3 combines elements of SAST and DAST by analyzing applications in real time during normal operations. This method allows for more comprehensive detection of vulnerabilities by observing code execution and interactions from within the application, as opposed to external DAST scanning. It enables organizations to detect issues that may go unnoticed by SAST or DAST, such as vulnerabilities arising from specific application workflows or interactions between components. Figure 3 depicts relevant IAST considerations for organizations.\n\nFigure 3 \u2014 Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) Consideration\n\n\n\nWhile IAST provides deeper insights compared to purely static or dynamic testing, it still faces challenges in WCRS. IAST tools require integration into the application, which can be complex and resource intensive. Moreover, they may not fully capture the behavior of third-party scripts or adequately monitor client-side code that executes in user browsers, limiting their effectiveness in preventing client-side attacks.\n\nStrengths\u2014IAST combines elements of SAST and DAST by analyzing applications in real time during normal operations.\n\nLimitations\u2014IAST tools require integration into the application, which can be complex and may not detect client-side script vulnerabilities introduced by third parties.\n\nTraditional Security Mechanisms are Limited\n\nSAST, DAST, IAST, and other traditional security tools, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems are limited by their perspective of application and infrastructure runtime states from a provider\u2019s point of view. They might inspect the observable network traffic between client web browsers and the trusted private hosting environment where much of the web application content might be hosted. However, these tools may overlook unintentional data leaks between client browsers and third-party services, as well as Magecart attacks that could exploit these trusted third-party services. The gaps in coverage of the traditional security tools are illustrated as potential risk in figure 4.\n\nFigure 4 \u2014 WCRS Limitations of Traditional Security Solutions\n\n\n\nThese limitations underscore the need for specialized client-side security solutions. Such specialized solutions should examine runtime states from a client\u2019s perspective and address the unique challenges of securing client-side code.\n\nTechnology Solutions for WCRS\n\nAs traditional application security mechanisms or approaches do not provide necessary safeguards against WCRS risk, organizations may need to consider other options for their WCRS capabilities. This section proposes certain mechanisms, each of which may have distinct approaches and corresponding benefits.\n\nThe web client-side security market has witnessed significant growth in recent years, driven by the increasing recognition of the risk associated with third-party scripts and supply chain attacks. This rapidly maturing space features a variety of solutions, each with distinct approaches and benefits.\n\nOrganizations should evaluate each approach carefully before selecting the most suitable options for their specific website contexts.\n\nCDN and Proxy-Based Solutions\n\nMany internet-facing web applications are already deployed behind content delivery networks (CDNs) to protect them from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and improve performance by caching content closer to end users. Given their strategic position in the delivery chain, CDN providers are well-suited to enhance client-side security by examining all resources before they reach client browsers. By intercepting and analyzing web traffic, CDNs can identify and block malicious scripts, ensuring that only safe and verified content is delivered.\n\nCDN and proxy-based solutions offer a transparent layer of security without requiring significant changes to existing infrastructure. This transparency is a major advantage, as it simplifies deployment and reduces the burden on development and operations teams.\n\nThese solutions typically feature a web-based portal that offers near real-time visibility into the resources loaded by clients. Through this portal, customers can monitor scripts and other elements being delivered to end users.\n\nStrengths\u2014 CDN and proxy-based solutions require minimal effort for the initial deployment if monitored web applications are already protected by the CDN solution from DDoS attacks. In such cases, the CDN provider is already able to monitor web traffic, and the client security module is simply enabled by the third-party CDN provider upon purchase. This solution also avoids the introduction of third-party code into web applications, often shortening implementation timelines and avoiding delays due to vetting by other cybersecurity and third-party risk teams within the purchasing organization.\n\nLimitations\u2014Visibility of third-party script behavior is limited to data transmitted via the CDN network and is not always representative of third-party script behavior on customer browsers, particularly once they begin interacting with the web application. Furthermore, this solution is only offered by a limited number of CDN providers. Internally facing applications, including traffic that is not routed through a particular CDN, would require a different approach for client-side protection.\n\nRemote Scanning Solutions\n\nRemote scanning solutions provide an external perspective on the security of web applications by assessing them from outside the organization\u2019s network. These tools are designed to identify vulnerabilities and malicious code that may be present in the client-side scripts and resources delivered to users. By periodically loading and crawling an internet-facing web application, remote scanners can detect and analyze scripts, security headers, and other resources that would be loaded by client browsers while interacting with a monitored web application, offering a simplified view with minimal effort from customers.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of remote scanning is its ease of implementation. Since these tools operate externally, they require minimal configuration and do not require updates to the existing infrastructure or code. Remote scanning can quickly provide a high-level overview of the security posture of web applications, highlighting areas of concern that require further investigation. However, while remote scanning is effective at identifying many common vulnerabilities, it has its limitations. For example, it may struggle to access and analyze content behind authentication barriers, and sophisticated malicious code can sometimes hide from these scans by only activating under specific conditions.\n\nRemote scanning solutions often include a web-based interface that offers detailed reports on the findings. These reports provide insights into the resources that would be loaded by client browsers. Customers can justify the presence of certain scripts, ensuring that they are necessary for enterprise operations while maintaining compliance. Additionally, these tools can notify users of any changes to the scripts or security headers, enabling timely responses to new risk and maintaining the integrity of client-side security measures.\n\nStrengths\u2014Remote scanning solutions are easy to implement and provide a basic, limited view into a monitored web application.\n\nLimitations\u2014Limited visibility and accuracy can lead to potential blind spots, especially when dealing with sophisticated threats. Resources that require user login, or those requiring more complicated actions from users before they are loaded and executed, may be overlooked. Furthermore, this solution offers no protection or remediation capabilities, as it is used for detection only.\n\nVendor Solutions Based on CSP Headers\n\nThe HTTP Content Security Policy (CSP) response header, universally supported by modern web browsers, provides advanced client-side security capabilities. Web applications can instruct client browsers via detailed policies on what resources are necessary parts of a web application and which safe locations they can be loaded from. Web browsers can also be instructed to block or report unexpected behavior.\n\nIn their simpler form, WCRS solutions may leverage a custom CSP header directive that does not directly block any suspicious behavior and simply instructs all client browsers to report what content was loaded in near real time. Dashboards display script inventories and observe script behavior for monitored applications. Many vendor solutions will take this a step further, leveraging proprietary and open-source threat intelligence feeds to alert their customers to any known malicious content and behavior. To further protect their customers, some vendor solutions will suggest more advanced CSPs that could be implemented in \u201cprevent mode\u201d. This mode will automatically block unexpected scripts. However, this option works best for simple web applications managed by technically savvy organizations due to the complexity and operational stability risk.\n\nIntegrating CSP headers requires customers to modify their web applications, which can delay implementation. Despite this, the header directive is transparent in its function and does not necessitate extensive vetting. By providing accurate and timely reporting without the need for more complex vendor-provided script integration, CSP header-based monitoring offers a balanced solution that enhances security while keeping code changes minimal and transparent to customers.\n\nStrengths\u2014CSP headers provide accurate real-time reporting of resources and scripts executed by client browsers. This solution requires minimal changes to the web application code.\n\nLimitations\u2014CSP headers require basic changes to the web application, which may necessitate change control, testing, and approvals. These necessary steps may delay implementation. Moreover, implementation of optional custom CSP policies may only work well for simple web applications, as these policies are often much more complex and can cause operational impact. They can block external resources and other essential web application functionality if they are not explicitly approved ahead of time.\n\nSolutions Based on Custom Vendor-Provided JavaScript\n\nMany WCRS solutions require monitored applications to include custom JavaScript provided by the vendor. This option introduces risk and can extend timelines for approval and vetting. However, despite these challenges, it provides additional granular visibility of script behavior at the data element level and enables dynamic policy evaluation and enforcement.\n\nThis approach allows for the implementation of script behavior policies, which go beyond the detection and reporting of unauthorized script behaviors and actively block unwanted actions in real time. For example, certain scripts can be authorized to access credit card fields and/or perform keystroke logging, while all others are denied from performing such actions. Vendor-provided JavaScript solutions can dynamically adjust policies based on the ongoing evaluation of script behaviors, enabling more proactive and robust client-side security controls.\n\nImplementing CSP headers with custom JavaScript requires significant changes to the web application, necessitating rigorous change control, testing, and approvals. Although preparations for this solution tend to be robust, its ability to provide granular control and advanced security features makes it a compelling choice for organizations that require high levels of WCRS.\n\nStrengths\u2014This solution offers granular real-time visibility and control over client-side resources at the data element level. It also offers dynamic policy evaluation and enforcement, including advanced security measures such as data firewalls.\n\nLimitations\u2014This solution\u2019s granular nature requires slightly more significant changes to web applications, leading to longer timelines for vetting third-party vendor code, approval, and implementation. To this end, vendor JavaScript code must be trusted by all monitored applications, introducing additional supply chain risk.\n\nVendor Solution Summary\n\nThere are several options available for organizations looking to gain better insights and control over WCRS, depending on organizational security needs. These options\n\nFigure 5 \u2014 Web Client Runtime Security Integration Options\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nOrganizations may consider the pros and cons of each of the above options before selecting solutions for their WCRS objectives. It may be the case that a single solution may not suit every website and organization, given the likely differences in the criticality of the business functions supported by the websites and the sensitivity of the information processed.\n\nThe next and final article (part 3) in this series will cover certain guidelines that organizations may find useful in operationalizing their WCRS programs.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 OWASP, Static Application Security Testing (SAST)\n\n2 OWASP, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)\n\n3 OWASP, Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)\n\nSergei Vasilevsky, CISSP\n\nIs the founder and president of ILIAM Consulting.

We talked to local experts who mentioned everything from color to dining experiences as this season\u2019s trends, where couples revoke the traditional and instead prioritize the intentional.\n\nColor, Color, Color\n\nMinimalism is out, and bold, textured color that reflects a couple\u2019s personality is in. Textiles and fabrics can truly help liven up a space, and that\u2019s exactly what professionals in the wedding industry are expecting to see more of in 2025. Think less neutral, more personal, says Over the Moon Events & Experiences owner and creative director Krysta Stoddard. \u201cThere\u2019s so much freedom, design wise, when you start working with different elements and colors,\u201d she says. That can be anything from eccentric tablescapes covered in a dramatic textile to draping in uncommon colors and fabrics.\n\nDramatic Drapes\n\nAny space can be immediately transformed with draping, but a single sheath of chiffon isn\u2019t going to cut it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be steering away from the white and blushes, and instead people are getting adventurous and using more color,\u201d says Cristina Bentley, VP director of operations at Bella Vista Designs. \u201cAnd draping plays a huge part in that.\u201d Imagine an extra layer of elegance, where yards of deep green velvet or vibrant patterns help transform spaces into something lush and luxurious.\n\nBella Vista Designs, a premier production company that just celebrated 20 years in business, has been doing draping since day one. \u201cA trend that we\u2019re seeing with draping is a lot of asymmetries \u2014 so it\u2019s not just a flat wall \u2026 [but] very eclectic layers on top of layers,\u201d says Bentley.\n\nDrapery drama by Bella Vista Designs | Credit: James and Jess Photography\n\nIntentional Design\n\nThis year, with color playing a huge factor in design, there\u2019s a shift from traditional to personal. That\u2019s reflected in nontraditional color palettes, but also in every element throughout the event; people are not just going to offer gifts because they\u2019ve been told to. Instead, says Tyler Speier of Tyler Speier Events, couples are requesting \u201creally intentional pieces that tell a story.\u201d\n\nThose high-touch elements can appear in the form of elaborate lighting like huge lantern or globe installations, or custom dance floors that tie the whole space together. \u201cI think people are going to start getting really creative with their dance floors,\u201d says Stoddard. Vendors like RCD Dance Floors can incorporate a monogram or introduce a vinyl overlay that matches a color or floral scheme to transform the space.\n\nDress Codes\n\nGone are the days where guests just show up for the ceremony, a meal, and maybe a dance. Couples are planning weekend-long celebrations for everyone; think coordinated hikes, yoga retreats, and wine tastings. With fewer and fewer couples asking friends and family to be part of the \u201cofficial\u201d wedding party, says Stoddard, dress codes and color palettes for three days of activities means everyone is part of the wedding. \u201cNot only is the bride, groom, or anyone in the bridal party going to make some fashion statement, but I think people are going to start giving mood boards or dress codes to their guests,\u201d she says.\n\nInteractive Experiences\n\nFor much of the population getting hitched, they\u2019ve placed a particular emphasis on experience. Couples are vying for grabbing guests\u2019 attention in a world of ephemeral design, which translates to more interactive wedding experiences. \u201cThe focus is so much on the experience,\u201d says Speier, that everything down to the smells, sounds, and tastes is being curated.\n\nTraditionally, says Speier, the festivities centered around the dance floor at the reception. Today, weddings are steering more toward \u201csexier, elevated dinner parties,\u201d he says, which translates to separate rooms for cocktail hour, dancing, and dinner \u2014 each with its own \u201cwow moment.\u201d That experiential moment can come in the shape of a poet with a vintage typewriter coming to cocktail hour or custom scent bars or upscale taco bars like Nomada or oyster bars where chefs shuck.\n\nContent Creators\n\nAs we mentioned last year, industry experts expect the demand for content creators to rise. In line with the desire to create a \u201cfeeling,\u201d on-site content creators can give couples something others can\u2019t: real-time content. Capturing the real-life moments allows for everyone to put down their phones and be more present \u2014 a feeling that will enhance the overall guest experience."

            "article_content": "Why ServiceNow (NOW) Shares Are Plunging Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of enterprise workflow software maker ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) fell 13% in the morning session after the company reported fourth quarter results: With shares up roughly 20% in the last three months (before this print) and the stock making a 52-week high just earlier this week, the market was pricing in good news for ServiceNow. With that said, roughly in line subscription revenue and total revenue this quarter did not meet heightened expectations. Additionally, RPO (remaining performance obligations, a key leading indicator of revenue), missed Wall Street's expectations by roughly 2%, although the 23% year on year growth was certainly healthy for a company of this scale. Moving down the income statement, adjusted operating margin of 29.5% beat expectations very slightly.\n\nLooking ahead, ServiceNow guided to Q1 subscription revenue of roughly $3.0 billion, in line with Wall Street's expectations. Adjusted operating margin of 30% is expected in Q1, again in line with expectations.\n\nA top priority for ServiceNow continues to be AI. Recent developments include AI Agent Orchestrator, which connects teams of AI agents working across tasks, systems, and departments to maximize efficiency. AI Agent Studio is a low code/no-code tool allowing businesses to build fully-customized AI agents. AI Agents is a product featuring ready-to-deploy agents designed for every workflow across IT, customer service, HR, and more.\n\nOverall ServiceNow reported Q4 2024 results and gave Q1 2025 guidance that was largely in line with expectations. Said differently, the business is tracking, with healthy, profitable growth. However, the valuation and recent run-up in the stock tell us that expectations were high heading into the print. It is therefore no surprise that the stock traded down.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy ServiceNow? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nServiceNow\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. Moves this big are rare for ServiceNow and indicate this news significantly impacted the market\u2019s perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago when the stock gained 14.1% on the news that the company reported an impressive \"beat and raise\" quarter, which was powered by what management considered \"elite-level execution.\" ServiceNow beat on the RPO (remaining performance obligations, a proxy for future revenues) line. Improvement in new large contract wins this quarter was another plus. Adjusted operating income also beat by a meaningful amount, and the company slightly raised its full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Analysts warn that stretched valuations and weakening credit cycles signal further downside risks.\n\nHeightened volatility, an FII sell-off, and tightening liquidity have caused the markets to enter a sharp corrective territory. However, the small- and mid-cap segment of the equities has taken a sharper fall compared to their large-cap peers, falling as much as 15 percent since the end of September.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe BSE400 small and midcap index is poised for its fifth 20 percent-plus correction post-GFC.\n\nIs this a blip or a bear market?\n\nHowever, is this fall a blip or a serious correction? According to analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities, this downturn could be the beginning of a bear market as domestic growth slows and durable liquidity slips into a deficit. Further, despite the 15 percent correction, SMID valuations are still high.\n\nThe past corrections can be classified as blips, such as those seen in 2015\u201316 and 2021\u201322 or bear markets, which was seen in 2011\u201313 and 2018\u201319.\n\nAs per Nuvama Institutional Equities, blips are short-lived, lasting two\u2013three quarters as SMIDs fall in line with large-caps. On the other hand, bear markets are prolonged correction phases with a 30\u201340 percent correction over two\u2013three years and large underperformance to the Nifty 50 and Sensex.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nDuring blips, all sectors decline, with little difference in sectoral performance. However, during bear markets cyclicals (real estate and industrials) tend to experience large underperformance and usually tend to correct by more than 50 percent.\n\nFurther, the brokerage noted that SMIDs are more exposed to the domestic economy than large-caps. Thus, it is only when domestic growth slackens do SMIDs tend to experience bear market and correct.\n\n\"The best way to assess the same is by looking at the domestic credit cycle and exports trend. If the credit cycle is weakening, then it is a sign of domestic weakness in which SMIDs will invariably underperform,\" said Nuvama analysts.\n\nBear markets are preceded by large 5Y returns (20 percent or above) while blips occur in the initial phases of bull markets and tend to have 10\u201315 percent 5Y returns in the run-up. Therefore, bear markets typically occur when domestic credit slows, liquidity tightens and midcaps experience a strong five-year rally on an absolute as well as relative basis.\n\nAlso Read | Budget cheer coming for railways? RVNL, Railtel, other rail stocks surge ahead of Budget 2025\n\nBlips on the other hand are an outcome of global weakness while domestic growth and liquidity conditions are generally stable. Furthermore, they are not preceded by a large medium-term rally.\n\nSo is this current correction a blip or bear market? Most signs point towards the SMIDs space entering a bear market. Domestic growth that is slackening this, which is evident in the credit cycle, while it was strong in 2023, in H1CY24 it has experienced a sharp moderation.\n\nAlso, excluding BFSI, SMID earnings are now underperforming large-cap peers and have moved into contraction. \"In fact, even in the Q3FY25 results season so far, SMID earnings have been disappointing and experienced large downgrades,\" noted the brokerage.\n\nThe performance of SMIDs relative to the Nifty 50 have been the highest in a post GFC-world. Even after the correction, they remain quite elevated \u2013 a trend that is typically observed in market corrections preceding bear markets.\n\nWith a sharp run up comes stretched valuations. Even, after the 15 percent correction, valuations are higher than the previous peaks.\n\nWay forward\n\nAs domestic growth is slackening, liquidity conditions are tightening and valuations as well as 5Y returns are quite elevated, Nuvama Institutional Equities believes there could be risks of a bear market. \"These have higher resemblance to the 2011\u201313 and 2018\u201319 phases. Thus, it is perhaps not yet a time to buy the dip,\" noted analysts.\n\nThe reversal from the previous bear markets, especially in 2018\u201319, was due to the US Federal Reserve. Hence, it is very important to monitor Fed actions and global liquidity hereon, as that will shape the SMIDs outcome.\n\nInvestors should maintain a very low beta bias as growth is still subdued and liquidity remains tight. \"In sectors, where margins are close to cyclical lows, and demand has stabilised, we think consolidation/costs focus could happen and those stocks/sectors could see larger upside,\" said Nuvama, adding, \"Despite the sharp correction, we recommend avoiding cyclical exposure in SMID portfolio.\"\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

With over six years of experience in the tech industry, he has established himself as a thought leader in scalable architecture and cloud computing. In a recent conversation, Karthik shared his journey, insights into modern software engineering, and his vision for the future of the industry.\n\n\"I've always been drawn to solving complex problems, especially when it comes to scale,\" Karthik reflects, describing how his passion for software engineering developed early on. His academic journey at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, where he earned his Master of Science in Computer Science, gave him a strong foundation. \"It was in grad school that I realized how much I enjoyed breaking down complicated technical challenges and finding scalable solutions,\" he adds.\n\nWhen discussing his approach to managing large-scale technical projects, Karthik explains the importance of evaluating system design through multiple lenses. \"When designing systems, I always start with performance, scalability, and security,\" he shares. \"Using advanced cloud services, we\u2019re able to build solutions that are both efficient and resilient. Regular architecture reviews are key to ensuring that systems continue to evolve with the changing demands of businesses.\"\n\nIn today's landscape, balancing system performance with data privacy compliance is a significant challenge. \"Data privacy is a core concern, especially when building scalable systems,\" Karthik notes. \"I design systems with privacy-by-design principles in mind, ensuring compliance with major privacy regulations while keeping performance intact. It's a delicate balance, but one that is achievable with careful planning and robust security measures.\"\n\nKarthik is a firm believer in using data to measure success. \"I always monitor performance metrics like system latency, throughput, and resource utilization,\" he says. \"But just as important is ensuring that engineering solutions align with business KPIs. By tracking both technical and business metrics, I can optimize systems to directly contribute to business objectives.\"\n\nInnovation is at the heart of Karthik's philosophy. \"I encourage my team to experiment and continuously learn,\" he explains. \"With emerging cloud services and big data technologies, there are always new approaches to explore. It\u2019s important to foster a culture of experimentation to stay ahead of the curve.\" He credits this mindset for many of the successful solutions he\u2019s pioneered.\n\nCollaboration with cross-functional teams has played a significant role in his career. \"Working with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders is essential,\" he reflects. \"I pride myself on being able to explain complex technical concepts in a way that everyone can understand. It\u2019s about making sure that the entire team is aligned, from a technical and business perspective.\"\n\nLooking to the future, Karthik is excited about the direction of cloud computing. \"Serverless architecture, machine learning operations, and edge computing are all areas I'm particularly excited about,\" he reveals. \"The integration of AI and ML capabilities with traditional systems is a game-changer for scalability and efficiency.\"\n\nAs Karthik continues to innovate and lead in the tech space, he also sees a growing emphasis on sustainable computing. \"There\u2019s a rising awareness about the environmental impact of technology,\" he says. \"Efficient system design can reduce carbon footprints, and I\u2019m proud to contribute to that movement.\"\n\nWith his unique blend of technical expertise and leadership, Karthik Venkatesan is shaping the future of software engineering, ensuring that it remains both cutting-edge and responsible."

            "article_content": "Never before had cleaning off so shaped history. But when an Egyptian princess went to take a quick dip in the Nile, her discovery and rescue of baby Moses in his basket set the Israelites on their path toward that eventual dramatic escape from the shackles of Egypt.\n\nThe second chapter of Exodus sets the scene: \u201cThe daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her attendants walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid (amatah) to bring it. When she opened it, she saw the child. He was crying, and she took pity on him. \u2018This must be one of the Hebrews\u2019 children,\u2019 she said.\u201d\n\nMiriam, Moses\u2019 sister, having held out hope at the riverbank that somehow her brother might sail past the clutches of Pharaoh\u2019s decree that all male Jewish children be slaughtered, saw what unfolded and helpfully offered to find a nursemaid to suckle the child. That volunteer caretaker she recommended, of course, was secretly Moses\u2019 biological mother, Yocheved. Moses then grew up in the palace of the king but with the spiritual and national mentorship of his Jewish family, uniquely positioning him to lead his people to freedom.\n\nThe act of warm-heartedness of this unnamed Egyptian was, ever since, celebrated by the Jewish tradition.\n\nMoses\u2019s rescue-by-princess was depicted on the western wall of the ruins of the ancient synagogue ruins found in Dura-Europos, modern-day Syria, in a rendering dated to the mid-third century C.E. In it, Pharaoh is off to the side, seated on his throne. A scribe next to him writes down the royal commands \u2014 no doubt the order to execute babies, the very edict his own daughter disobeys.\n\nRabbinic texts also parsed every aspect of the brief episode. Why did she need to go bathe, they wondered? Sefer HaYashar suggests a sunburn. God had sent a heatwave, which seared the Egyptians and left them seeking a means of cooling off. Perhaps, came another conjecture, she had that awful skin disease, tzara\u2019at. Thus Shemot Rabbah\u2019s proposal that \u201cPharaoh\u2019s daughter was a leper; that is why she went to bathe. When she touched the basket she was cured. That is why she had compassion for Moses and loved him exceedingly.\u201d\n\nPirkei deRebbe Eliezer adds that her sensitive skin required the cold Nile water, as opposed to the warm water of an indoor facility. Her subsequent reward, though unspecified in the Bible itself, was eternal bliss \u2013 \u201cWhosoever preserves a life is as though he had kept alive the whole world. Therefore was she worthy to (inherit) the life in this world and the life in the world to come.\u201d Mystical texts record her entering the heavenly realm alive, sitting alongside Elijah and the Messiah.\n\nThe Talmud, in turn, senses a sign of her personal fealty to the Jewish cause as an aspiring convert to the faith. \u201cRabbi Yohanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai: This teaches that she came down to the river to cleanse herself from the impurity of her father\u2019s idols, as she was immersing herself as part of the conversion process.\u201d\n\nNo doubt miracles enabled the shocking rescue. She felt compelled to head to the site because of a dream, offered the first-century work Biblical Antiquities. Other texts add that the princess saw the Divine Presence hovering above Moses. When her maidens tried to convince her not to save him, the angel Gabriel came from heaven and struck them down. Though perhaps it wasn\u2019t a maiden she sent to grab the basket, but rather her arm stretched many cubits (amot) to enable her to grab it.\n\nAnother Talmudic tractate gives the anonymous-in-the-Bible heroine a name reflecting her loyalty to Israel\u2019s God. Actually, two names. She was called Bityah (\u201cGod\u2019s daughter) or Yehudiyah (\u201cJewess\u201d).\n\nWas she even Pharaoh\u2019s biological daughter? A surprising Midrash Talpiot argued that she was not. Rather, she and Moses\u2019 future wife Tziporah were Moses\u2019 biological sisters (!). The former was seized by force by the Egyptian king, and the latter by Jethro, Pharaoh\u2019s adviser and Moses\u2019 eventual father-in-law, and raised in their respective homes. (Lest one be shocked that Moses, according to this text, eventually married his sister, the midrash notes that this was permissible prior to Sinai, and Tziporah was uniquely righteous.)\n\nOf course, suggests the Arukh HaShulchan, Pharaoh\u2019s daughter was spared the death of the firstborn \u2014 the 10th of those notorious Plagues \u2014 in the merit of Moshe, whose life she had saved.\n\nMoses undoubtedly expressed gratitude for the rescue. As the scholar of the Second Temple period Malka Simkovich has noted, Ezekiel the Tragedian, a second- or first-century B.C.E. Jew who lived in Egypt, composed a Greek play whose verses have Moses reminiscing how: \u201cThroughout my boyhood years the princess did, for princely rearing and instruction apt, provide all things, as though I were her own, the circle of the days then being full.\u201d\n\nSimkovich also notes that the second century BCE Book of Jubilees calls Bityah a different name, Thermuthis, as does the historian Josephus. A popular Greek name for Egyptian women at the time, it\u2019s a variation of the Egyptian Renen\u016btet, the Egyptian goddess of nourishment, from the verb meaning \u201cto nurse or rear,\u201d a fitting appellation for the adoptive figure.\n\nIn Josephus\u2019 dramatic detailing, after the extraordinary rescue, she hoped Moses would himself become king: \u201c\u2026 one day she brought Moses to her father and showed him to him, and told him how she had been mindful for the succession, were it God\u2019s will to grant her no child of her own, by bringing up a boy of divine beauty and generous spirit, and by what a miracle she had received him of the river\u2019s bounty, \u2018and I thought,\u2019 she said, \u2018to make him my child and heir to your kingdom.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlas, in playing with his adopted grandson, Pharaoh freaks out. \u201cTo please his daughter, [he] placed his diadem upon [Moses\u2019] head. But Moses tore it off and flung it to the ground, in mere childishness, and trampled it underfoot; and this was taken as an omen of evil import to the kingdom.\u201d\n\nWhen the adult Moses led his people to liberation, Bityah joined her now-fellow Jews and went too. In her old age, she married Caleb, who, alongside Joshua, encouraged the desert-wandering Israelite tribes to ignore the bad report of the spies who had returned from scouting the Promised Land. As the Talmud tells it, \u201cThe Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let Caleb, who rebelled against the advice of the spies, come and marry the daughter of Pharaoh, who rebelled against the idols of her father\u2019s home.\u201d\n\nModern literary scholars have suggested the princess\u2019 salvation foreshadows God\u2019s own extension of His saving hands to His people. Pharaoh\u2019s daughter\u2019s coming down and seeing a baby crying is mirrored by God\u2019s actions in Exodus\u2019 third chapter, which has Him telling the now adult Moses \u201cI have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out \u2026 So I have come down to rescue them.\u201d\n\nThe bath of Bityah (or Yehudiyah or Thermuthis) then, even without the rabbinic accounts of the many miracles involved in her saving of Moses and subsequent religious conversion, offers a model for those non-palace-dwellers of us to follow. If her dunk to cool off on that hot Egyptian afternoon teaches us anything, it\u2019s that small acts of kindness to the other might very well draw forth God\u2019s salvation for us all.\n\nRabbi Dr. Stuart Halpern is Senior Adviser to the Provost of Yeshiva University and Deputy Director of Y.U.\u2019s Straus Center for Torah and Western Thought.
