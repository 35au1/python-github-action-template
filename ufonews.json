            "article_content": "With global interest in UFOs at an all-time high, particularly in the United States where mysterious drone sightings have been driving everyone crazy, two Israeli researchers have uncovered fascinating patterns in who reports these mysterious sightings \u2014 and when.\n\nTheir study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, reveals that UFO reports might tell us less about what\u2019s in the sky and more about what\u2019s happening on the ground, particularly in our bank accounts.\n\nOhad Raveh from Hebrew University and Nathan Goldstein from Bar-Ilan University were trying to solve an interesting puzzle: How can we measure what the public is paying attention to in different places and at different times? This is important for understanding the economy, but it\u2019s difficult to measure.\n\nThey looked at years of data cataloguing recorded sightings of UFOs \u2014 or as they refer to them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena).\n\nTheir assumption was that when people report seeing something strange in the sky, they\u2019re clearly paying attention to their surroundings. The researchers thought this could be a useful way to measure public attention.\n\n\u201c We set out to understand what the association is between attention given to the sky and attention given to the economy,\u201d explains Raveh.\n\nTwo contradictory findings?\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of reports from the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States and discovered that more wealthy areas consistently report more UFO sightings than less wealthy regions.\n\nRaveh and Goldstein initially believed that this phenomenon could be explained by understanding attention as a hierarchical system: you give attention to the most pressing issues before you worry about other things.\n\n\u201cOnce you give attention to the fundamental things, then you may give attention to things that are more luxurious,\u201d Raveh elaborates. \u201cAttention to the economy is a fundamental thing, because in the end that\u2019s what brings food to your table. But once you attend to that, then you have more time on your hands to start looking at the sky.\u201d\n\nSo, because people who are more financially secure can let their minds (and eyes) wander from their budgets, they\u2019re more likely to see UAPs, right?\n\nHowever, that theory runs into some turbulence when considering the second pattern they uncovered during their research: Across the board, both poor and wealthy areas saw an increase in UFO sightings during economic downturns \u2013 a pattern that caught the researchers by surprise.\n\n\u201c We thought that the two types of attention would be substitutable. Because attention is a limited resource, and if you give attention to, say, the sky, that would be at the expense of other types of attention that you can give to other factors like the economy,\u201d says Raveh. \u201cBut apparently it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: Wealthy areas generally report more UFOs than poor areas, but when any area hits hard economic times, UFO reports increase.\n\nTurns out rich people get to spend more time looking for aliens. Photo by Jonas Von Werne via Pexels\n\nIt\u2019s all about attention\n\nThis apparent contradiction makes sense when you realize UFO reports are really measuring how much attention people are paying to their surroundings.\n\nWealthy people generally have more free time and mental space to notice unusual things in the sky. But during economic downturns, people everywhere have more time on their hands (often due to job losses or reduced work hours) and thus spot more UFOs.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by what the researchers saw during Covid lockdowns: When people were forcibly given more free time (even if they weren\u2019t necessarily experiencing economic hardship), UFO sightings increased.\n\nOverall, the research findings serve as strong evidence that UFO/UAP sightings serve as a reliable indicator of public attention patterns, which opens new possibilities for understanding how public attention influences economic outcomes.\n\nOnly one question remains, though \u2014 have the researchers seen any UFOs themselves?\n\n\u201c I wish!\u201d jokes Raveh. \u201cActually, since we started to work, I\u2019ve tried to give more attention to the skies. But I haven\u2019t seen anything, unfortunately. I hope they visit Israel sometime.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

More info\n\nRobbie Williams might be setting his sights on extraterrestrial affairs, as the Angels star has been courted to act as the face of UFOs in the UK. Leading ufologist and documentary maker Mark Christopher Lee believes that Robbie has been picked to potentially be an Earthly ambassador for alien beings.\n\nRobbie is no stranger to alien life either having openly admitted to encountering a UFO so near he could have lobbed a tennis ball at it, reports the Daily Star. He also spoke of the appearance of a 'gold ball of light' during a recording session for his song Arizona which touches on alien encounters.\n\nMr Lee is confident that the evidence presented in his forthcoming documentary, set to release later in 2025, will solidify the reality of alien life. He has also envisioned Robbie as an ideal spokesperson for their existence due to his celebrity status and ability to communicate with the masses.\n\nREAD MORE: Netflix Missing You viewers all notice same problem with Harlan Coben's new series\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nMr Lee has approached Robbie through George Knapp, chief investigative reporter for Nevada's Channel 8 I-Team and creator of 'Hunt For The Skinwalker', which featured the pop icon. He said: \"I do believe what Robbie says. I've spoken to George Knapp, who is friends with him, who is a filmmaker, presenter, journalist. We were chatting about Robbie Williams.\n\n\"I'm trying to reach out to Robbie to push forward for UFO disclosure in the UK. I think he could be a figurehead. We need someone like him in the UK. I want to get together and talk about how we can do that.\"\n\nMr Lee also touched upon the mysterious link between musicians and UFOs, saying: \"People love Robbie, he speaks the truth, he's from the heart. And there is this link between musicians and UFOs. I do think there is that element. I think it's the part of the brain that we're using, that creative side, which is making that contact and what these phenomena is picking up on. It's the collective unconscious. We're all connected and connected to the universe and beyond.''\n\nRobbie's extraterrestrial experiences span three decades. Mark said he believes they keep happening because he has allowed himself to be open to contact.\n\nHe said: \"It's the collective unconscious. We're all connected and connected to the universe and beyond. There's the synchronicities in your life - meaningful coincidences.\""

Learn more \u203a\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to ignore the rapid rise in the capabilities of artificial intelligence tools in recent months. Microsoft hasn\u2019t been shy in stuffing Windows full of AI features: Windows computers now come with a dedicated key for launching Copilot, Microsoft\u2019s AI assistant, which has been integrated into the operating system.\n\nWe\u2019ll guide you through everything you can use Copilot for on your Windows laptop or desktop, and how you can get it up and running. We\u2019ll also explain the difference between Copilot and a Copilot+ PC, which is a label you might have spotted if you\u2019ve been shopping for a Windows computer lately.\n\nCopilot on Windows\n\nWhen it comes to the Copilot assistant inside Windows, it\u2019s very similar to the Copilot app on the web. You can jump between the web app and the app in Windows, using the same Microsoft account, and carry on where you left off. Your chat history should also be synced between Windows and the web.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. Email address Sign up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nThere are a number of ways to launch Copilot on Windows. You can launch it from the Start menu like any other program: Just search for it or find it in the main apps list. You might also find WIndows has pinned it to the taskbar. Copilot can also be launched by pressing the Copilot key on your keyboard (two curved rectangles next to each other), if you\u2019ve got a newer PC with the key included.\n\nCopilot gives you some ideas for getting started. Screenshot: Microsoft\n\nOnce you\u2019re into Copilot, you can sign in with your Microsoft account, and start chatting. You\u2019ll see some suggestions for conversation topics: daily news, motivation or meditation tricks, or prompts for a short story, as examples. Just type in the Message Copilot box to get started, or click the microphone icon to the right, if you\u2019d rather talk instead. Bear in mind that your chats are still saved when you quit the app and open it up again (click the clock icon to see your chat history).\n\nYou can ask Copilot questions (like how DNA works or when Brazil became a country), get it to generate text for everything from emails to poems, and use it for advice too\u2014with the usual caveats about AI hallucinations. It\u2019s always worth double-checking what AI tells you, though you will notice that for some answers you\u2019ll get references back to the web, so you can verify the accuracy of the information.\n\nCopilot can work with images as well. Screenshot: Microsoft\n\nCopilot can be useful in the same way that AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini can be. You can ask about how to boost your confidence, for example, or how to do something on Windows, or how to best wrap an oddly shaped present. Click the + (plus) button to the left of the input box, and you can start a new chat or upload an image to use with Copilot. You can ask about the contents of an image, or use them as prompts (so something like \u201cgive me a recipe with this ingredient\u201d).\n\nYou\u2019re also able to create your own AI art with Copilot\u2014just ask it to draw something or create an image of something. As with other similar AI tools, the more specific you are about what you want to see and its style, the more likely you are to get something close to what you wanted. Each image comes with a download button next to it (the downward arrow), so you can save it somewhere else.\n\nUsing Copilot+ PCs\n\nYou may have noticed you can now buy Windows laptops that are classed as Copilot+ PCs too. Rather confusingly, these don\u2019t have a different version of Copilot installed, but they do have a specific bit of hardware inside: A neural processing unit (NPU), which means more AI processing can be done faster on the actual device, without having to transfer data to and from the cloud.\n\nYou can get Copilot on Windows 11 whether or not you have a Copilot+ PC in front of you, and you\u2019ll be able to access all of the features mentioned above. There are some extra features that a Copilot+ PC gives you, including Windows Studio Effects, which lets you add AI-powered visual enhancements to your video calls.\n\nUse AI to enhance your Paint pictures. Screenshot: Microsoft\n\nAnother additional feature is something called Cocreator in Paint. Load up the application, use a text prompt to describe what you\u2019d like a picture of, and then start drawing: The Cocreator AI will soup up your scribblings so they enhance what you\u2019ve already done. Just click Cocreator in the toolbar at the top to get started.\n\nThen there\u2019s Windows Recall, though this is only in testing for early adopters at the moment. It takes snapshots over time of what you\u2019re doing on your PC\u2014snapshots that are kept local and encrypted\u2014and then lets you search back through them to find a file, webpage, idea, or whatever else. It makes it easier to get back to something you\u2019ve previously been working on.\n\nRecall helps you go back in time on your PC. Screenshot: Microsoft\n\nIf you\u2019re part of the Windows Insider program, Recall is available as a preinstalled app. Once it\u2019s up and running, you can load it from the Start menu or taskbar, and see a timeline of screenshots going back from the current point. You can browse these images manually, or search for something specific (so searching for \u201cPopular Science,\u201d for example, would bring up all the times you were looking at the Popular Science website).\n\nCopilot+ PCs also give you Automatic Super Resolution, which can tweak screen resolution during gaming to improve quality, and Live Translate, which translates any audio on your computer in real time. There\u2019s also a Cocreator-like tool in Photos, that lets you reimagine existing images in different styles or with different elements."

The clip was posted by Myra Moore, a content creator who identifies as a paranormal expert and has since received about 5 million views. The caption of the post reads as follows, \u201cA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?\u201dIn the video, Myra explains that the video was shot by a passenger on a plane. \u201cThey were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there. What did they capture,\u201d she continued.Reacting to the post, one user commented, \u201cThis is crazy, is that aliens or humans in the cloud?\" However, some were a little more skeptical, \u201cWhy does the person with the camera keep panning around? Why can't they focus on those \"people\" and see if they move or see what they are doing?\u201d Some even straight-up called this a creation of AI, \u201cEveryone is getting fooled so hard by AI! If you haven\u2019t seen it in the last 30-40 years, then it\u2019s probably AI!\u201dOne user in the comment section reasoned that maybe what one can see in the video is an interplay of light, shadows, and human imagination. The human mind tries to find patterns and assigns meaning to random shapes\u2014a phenomenon known as pareidolia, where we see familiar forms, such as faces or figures, in otherwise abstract visuals. It is thus suggested, to not spread fear based on such videos until they are not authenticated."

            "article_content": "Viral Video: A new video circulating on social media has ignited wild speculation and widespread curiosity, as a mysterious sighting captured by a passenger on a commercial flight is stirring up online chatter. The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it?

Some viewers suggest that the figures could merely be people in a snowy landscape, while others propose more outlandish theories, including the idea that the sight could be steam rising from industrial gases or fog.\n\nA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?#theparanormalchic #alien #airline #paranormal #ufo #fyp pic.twitter.com/CARF6XFGxD \u2014 Myra Moore- The Paranormal Chic (@t_paranorm_chic) December 30, 2024\n\nThe clip\u2019s lack of clear location and timing has only added to the mystery, leaving many to wonder whether the sighting could have an otherworldly explanation. \"What did they capture?\" Moore asked, encouraging her followers to share their opinions and theories. The video has since gone viral on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where users are divided between humorous interpretations and more serious discussions about the potential implications of the footage.\n\nUsers Reaction to the Viral Post\n\nThe most conclusive explanation of the video was given by a twitter user with an image and he said that, \u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks.\u201d\n\nAnother one said, \u201cThat\u2019s wild.

The program was initially announced back in November and is officially available in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, and Australia starting Thursday.\n\nThe program is expected to enhance Spotify's video podcast library, likely aimed at competing with YouTube, which currently dominates the overall video space. According to Spotify, over 65% of eligible podcast shows have already enrolled in the Partner Program since the company revealed it at its Now Playing event. This includes Smart Money Happy Hour, The Paranormal Podcast, The Makeshift Podcast, Girls Rewatch Podcast, and more.\n\nSpotify has also begun allowing Premium users to watch video podcasts without ads. It also launched a new tool called Podcast Clips, which are short-form videos uploaded by creators to promote their shows and help users discover them more easily. Since the feature's launch in select markets in November, the company claims that clips are \u201c33% more effective than previews at converting browsers into engaged listeners.\u201d"

After all, the ghostly multiplayer game has been out for over four years. That\u2019s a considerable amount of time to familiarize yourself with all the spookiness. Kinetic Games seems aware of that, because changes are coming to every single contract.\n\nIn a landscape full of co-op games, Phasmophobia manages to get the balance just right between slightly absurd comedy and genuine scares. You and a group of intrepid paranormal investigators look into some spectral happening, with the goal being to chart whatever the paranormal entity actually is before it gets angry and aggressive and traps you all.\n\nIt\u2019s often harder than it sounds, but in the right group it\u2019s a good laugh. As part of an overhaul for 2025, the horror game is getting a substantial rework. Areas are getting changed, new tools are being added, and the general structure of a round is being tweaked.\n\nStarting on the latter, rather than grading findings on quality now, the multiplayer game offers rewards for \u2018unique\u2019 captures on different devices. Essentially, the first person of the group to get a reading of something in a particular media form will get a specific bonus for doing so, encouraging everyone to use their entire inventory.\n\nTo complement this, a tape recorder is now part of your arsenal, for auditory field recordings. Anything you pick up can be played back afterward, and it\u2019s suggested that the longer you stick around the weirder those sounds will get \u2013 jinkies!\n\nTiny peeks are given of the Bleasdale and Grafton Farmhouses, both of which will look different in due time. Several rooms in the former are being done up, encouraging fresh visits to admire the d\u00e9cor and see what fresh poltergeists are floating around.\n\nThese updates are coming throughout 2025, according to the developer\u2019s post \u2013 something to look forward to or anxiously await, depending on your temperament. Have a look at our lists of the best zombie games and the best ghost games if you\u2019re a scarehound who wants to really jump out of your skin.\n\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides, or join our community Discord to stay in the know."

            "source": "BGR",
            "article_content": "OpenAI held a massive ChatGPT-centric event before Christmas, making several key announcements for ChatGPT and other genAI tools it currently offers. The reasoning ChatGPT model o1 and the text-to-video Sora service got public releases. OpenAI also demoed the o3 model coming later this year, released Canvas, and even made ChatGPT available via WhatsApp texting.\n\nWhat OpenAI failed to do is keep a privacy promise made earlier this year. The company announced a Media Manager feature back in May. The tool is meant to allow creators of all sorts of content to opt out of ChatGPT and other genAI models training.\n\nOpenAI said Media Manager will be available by 2025, but that hasn\u2019t happened. Not only that, but the company might not be actively working on the feature, and there\u2019s no telling when it will come out.\n\nTraining models like ChatGPT require lots of data so the AI can learn to predict what the user needs. OpenAI uses all sorts of data from the internet to train its AI, including copyright content from creators it didn\u2019t obtain access to. Several creators sued the company after finding their works were used to train the AI.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nMedia Manager should be a tool that lets creators opt out of training for all sorts of media content, not just written text. OpenAI described Media Manager as a cutting-edge tool to protect user privacy:\n\nThis will require cutting-edge machine learning research to build a first-ever tool of its kind to help us identify copyrighted text, images, audio, and video across multiple sources and reflect creator preferences.\n\nWhile that sounded great on paper, we have all forgotten about it. OpenAI has not mentioned Media Manager since May, and development for the privacy tool might not have advanced. Says TechCrunch, which talked to people familiar with the project.\n\nThe blog has learned that Media Manager was rarely viewed as an important project internally. A former OpenAI employee told TechCrunch that Media Manager wasn\u2019t a priority. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember anyone working on it,\u201d they said.\n\nAlso, a person who doesn\u2019t work at OpenAI but coordinates work with the AI firm said they discussed the tool with the company but haven\u2019t received any updates.\n\nTechCrunch also notes that an OpenAI legal team member involved with Media Manager transitioned to a part-time consultant role.\n\nNone of this comes directly from OpenAI. Insiders who shared information might not have access to the bigger picture. But even if TechCrunch\u2019s information isn\u2019t accurate, there\u2019s still the fact that OpenAI has been quiet on the Media Manager feature for half a year.\n\nIf it were finished, the privacy tool could have easily been a \u201c12 Days\u201d announcement. At the very least, OpenAI could have updated the timeline.\n\nA more cynical view is that OpenAI is biding its time. Recent reports said that training next-gen ChatGPT versions isn\u2019t working as planned. OpenAI saw delays for GPT-5, and access to better-quality training data might be one factor impacting development. Copyrighted content that makes it into AI training data could be better quality than other types of content. I\u2019m just speculating here.\n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at is that a Media Manager tool might be released eventually, maybe once the copyright lawsuits against OpenAI are concluded and the company knows exactly what it can and can\u2019t do when training new AI models. Who knows if Media Manager might be needed once that happens. Also, ChatGPT\u2019s GPT-5 upgrade might get out of development and closer to release by then.\n\nFinally, even if Media Manager were available, it would still require some work from creators to flag out copyrighted content that should not train the AI. Despite that, copyright content might be found in all sorts of places on the internet that creators would not flag. OpenAI would crawl those places and the content might still make it into training data sets.\n\nMedia Manager delays aside; regular ChatGPT users have privacy settings at their disposal to opt out of having the data in their prompts train the AI."

            "article_content": "Hinton, who left Google in 2023 to focus on ethical concerns in AI, has also previously criticised OpenAI. Illustration: Desk\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, widely regarded as the 'godfather of AI', has voiced strong opposition to OpenAI's move to transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit company, as per a recent report by Business Insider. In a statement shared by Encode, an organisation advocating for ethical AI, Hinton criticised the shift as a betrayal of the company's founding principles.\n\n\"OpenAI was established as a safety-focused nonprofit and made commitments to that mission in its charter,\" said Hinton, who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in neural networks. \"It received significant tax and other benefits under that structure. Abandoning those commitments now sets a troubling precedent for others in the AI field.\"\n\nAs per Business Insider, Hinton's remarks align with legal efforts by Elon Musk, who cofounded OpenAI in 2015 but left its board in 2018. Musk has filed an injunction to block OpenAI's transition, arguing that the company is prioritising profits over its original goal of ensuring AI safety and public accountability.\n\nEncode has also lent its support to Musk's case. \"OpenAI's pivot to a profit-driven model shows why public oversight is crucial in shaping the future of transformative technologies,\" said Adam Billen, Encode's vice president of public policy, as per the Business Insider report.\n\nHinton, who left Google in 2023 to focus on ethical concerns in AI, has previously criticised OpenAI. At an October press conference, he described CEO Sam Altman as \"more focused on profits than safety,\" calling the situation \"unfortunate\".\n\nThe debate now comes as OpenAI, now valued at $157 billion after a recent $6.6 billion funding round, faces increasing scrutiny over its commercial ambitions, further states the report."

            "article_content": "There is very little movement in markets over the Christmas period, so this week we are looking at selling and what might affect markets in the new year.\n\nThis time of the year is quieter on tillage farms.\n\nYes, there is still work to be done, but there is time to catch up on crop records, costs and returns.\n\nKnowing the costs and returns of all your crops is essential.\n\nIn order to decide on what price to sell your grain at, you need to know your costs, so get this job done as soon as possible and decide on a price that you are happy to sell at to spread risk.\n\nThis was brought up numerous times at Tillage Day 2024 and it was clear it is a job that more farmers need to do.\n\nHaving those figures to hand and deciding on a number to sell at makes the decision easier to make once you get a text message with prices from your co-op or merchant.\n\nForward selling\n\nIn recent years, harvest prices have worked out very well for people, but that doesn\u2019t say it will happen every year.\n\nThat said, you are probably better off to either take the harvest price every year or do some forward selling every year, rather than dipping in and out of both of them, or else you may lose out badly in certain years.\n\nIf you are forward selling grain, then you should only be selling about 50% on your estimated production. You should be a little bit pessimistic with yield predictions as well.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be in a situation where you have sold grain, but don\u2019t have that grain. At Tillage Day, Donal Moloney of Tirl\u00e1n explained that farmers can sell as little as 20t at a time when forward selling grain.\n\nIf you think about that, you could be selling small amounts of grain every week or every two weeks or even once a month to get an average price from the season.\n\nThis would be spreading risk - something similar to the Boortmalt pricing system where an average price is taken every week from the middle of April to the middle of September.\n\n2025 prices\n\nLooking ahead to prices and it is very hard to know where they will end up this season. There was a lift in prices in December.\n\nTeagasc economist Fiona Thorne estimated that prices could rise by 5% in 2025 at their recent Outlook Conference.\n\nThis prediction was based on the difference between historic predicted values of French wheat prices and the actual outcomes.\n\nTeagasc estimated an increase in EU cereal production and an increase in Irish cereal yields. Looking at costs and Teagasc placed fertiliser prices down 5%, but fertiliser use up on a whole-farm basis."

Dinosaur fossils are displayed at auction house Christie's in London, Britain, in his undated handout photo. (credit: Christie's/Handout via REUTERS)\n\nMegalosaurus was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named and described in 1824, kick-starting the last 200 years of dinosaur science and public interest.\n\nEmma Nicholls, vertebrate paleontologist ay the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, said: \"Scientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found.\"\n\nThe buried prints came to light when quarry worker Gary Johnson felt \"unusual bumps\" as he was stripping the clay back with his vehicle in order to expose the quarry floor.\n\nMore than one hundred researchers then excavated in the site in June, where they found around 200 footprints, the universities said in a statement."

This guide by Christian Peverelli provides a detailed roadmap to help you create and monetize a no-code AI business focused on resume optimization for job seekers. By addressing a specific problem, using no-code platforms, and targeting the right audience, you can develop a functional and revenue-generating product in a short timeframe.\n\nChristian Peverelli takes you behind the scenes of a whirlwind 3 day journey, showing how a simple yet impactful idea\u2014an AI-powered resume optimization tool\u2014was transformed into a functional, revenue-generating product. Whether you\u2019re an aspiring entrepreneur, a tech enthusiast, or just someone curious about how to bring an idea to life, you\u2019ll find actionable insights here. From brainstorming and branding to building and selling, this guide breaks down the process step by step, offering a roadmap to help you create your own no-code business.\n\nCreating an AI Business\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Identified a clear problem: Job seekers struggle with resume customization, addressed by an AI-powered resume optimization tool with a freemium model.\n\nBuilt a strong brand (\u201cGet Get Job\u201d) with professional branding elements and a user-focused landing page to attract and convert users.\n\nDeveloped the product using no-code platforms like Bolt, Supabase, and Make.com, allowing rapid creation without coding expertise.\n\nAcquired customers through LinkedIn outreach, using tools like Outbond and Smartlead, and offered discounted plans to attract early adopters.\n\nAchieved profitability within 72 hours, generating $348 in revenue against $110 in costs, showcasing the feasibility of launching a no-code AI business quickly.\n\n1: Identify the Problem and Validate Your Idea\n\nThe foundation of any successful business lies in solving a real-world problem. In this case, the challenge was clear: job seekers often struggle to tailor their resumes to specific job descriptions. This process is not only time-consuming but also tedious, leaving many job seekers frustrated. The solution? An AI-powered resume optimization tool that simplifies and streamlines this task.\n\nThe target audience was identified as active job seekers, particularly those using platforms like LinkedIn. These individuals could benefit significantly from a tool that automates resume customization. To validate the idea, a freemium business model was chosen. This model offered basic features for free while charging $29 per month (or discounted annual plans) for premium features. This pricing strategy ensured accessibility while providing a clear path to revenue generation.\n\n2: Build a Strong Brand\n\nA strong and cohesive brand identity is critical for building trust and attracting users, especially in the early stages of a business. The business was named \u201cGet Get Job,\u201d a memorable and relevant name that resonated with the target audience. Branding elements such as a professional logo, a consistent color palette, and a user-friendly landing page were created using tools like Namecheap, Luca, and Coolors.\n\nThe landing page played a pivotal role as the primary point of interaction with potential users. It clearly outlined the product\u2019s features, benefits, and pricing structure, making it easier to convert visitors into users. A well-designed landing page is not just a marketing tool; it is the cornerstone of any successful online business, as it establishes credibility and communicates value effectively.\n\nBuild a Profitable AI Business in 72 Hours (No-Coding)\n\nEnhance your knowledge on AI business optimization by exploring a selection of articles and guides on the subject.\n\n3: Develop the Product Without Coding\n\nThanks to advancements in no-code platforms, creating a functional product without writing a single line of code is now possible. For this project, the app was built using Bolt, a no-code app builder, while automation workflows were implemented through Make.com. Supabase was used to handle backend tasks such as user authentication and data storage.\n\nThe core functionality of the product revolved around solving the identified problem. Users could upload their resumes, link job descriptions, and receive AI-generated, optimized resumes tailored to specific roles. This feature directly addressed the pain point of resume customization, offering a practical and valuable solution for job seekers. By using no-code tools, the development process was not only faster but also more cost-effective, allowing the focus to remain on delivering a high-quality user experience.\n\n4: Acquire Customers\n\nWith the product ready, the next step was to attract users. LinkedIn emerged as the ideal platform for outreach due to its large base of job seekers. Tools like Outbond and Smartlead were used for lead generation, contact enrichment, and email automation. These tools enabled personalized communication at scale, making it easier to connect with potential users.\n\nTo incentivize early adopters, discounted annual plans were offered. This strategy not only encouraged sign-ups but also provided valuable feedback for refining the product. Early customer acquisition often involves unscalable, hands-on efforts, such as personalized outreach and direct engagement. While these methods can be time-intensive, they are crucial for validating the business model and building an initial user base.\n\n5: Overcome Challenges\n\nLaunching a business in such a short timeframe is not without its challenges. Technical issues, such as database integration and automation workflow errors, required troubleshooting and persistence. These obstacles underscored the importance of adaptability and problem-solving skills in the startup process.\n\nOperational challenges also arose, including managing outreach campaigns and responding to user inquiries. These tasks demanded significant time and effort but were essential for securing initial customers and establishing a foundation for growth. Overcoming these hurdles required a combination of strategic planning, resourcefulness, and a willingness to learn from setbacks.\n\n6: Measure Results\n\nDespite the challenges, the project achieved profitability within the 72-hour timeframe. Two sales were made, generating $348 in revenue against $110 in costs, resulting in a profit of $238. This outcome demonstrated the feasibility of launching a profitable no-code AI business quickly and efficiently. By focusing on a specific problem and using the right tools, it is possible to achieve tangible results in a short period.\n\nTools and Platforms That Made It Possible\n\nThe success of this project was made possible by a variety of tools and platforms, each playing a crucial role in different aspects of the business:\n\nAI and Automation: Make.com, ChatGPT, Dumpling API.\n\nMake.com, ChatGPT, Dumpling API.

In terms of departure from normal temperatures, the coldest weather will actually be south of us, but it will be plenty chilly here.\n\nA storm system that brought rain to the area the middle part of the week will be in northern Quebec at the same time a new massive ocean storm starts developing hundreds of miles to our east this weekend. This upper-level pattern is going to pull down much colder air than we saw at the end of December and the start of the new year.\n\nWith the new year and a new month upon us, our first weekend of January is looking calm and tranquil \u2014 although it will be cold. If you\u2019re looking to partake in outdoor activities, at least you won\u2019t have to worry about any snow or ice.\n\nTemperatures on Friday will be mostly in the 30s across New England. Boston Globe\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriday will be the least cold day with temperatures reaching the mid- to upper 30s, but the Augusta wind will make it feel a lot colder. Morning wind chills will be in the upper teens to 20s.\n\nLook for highs only reaching around 30 degrees on Saturday and Sunday. The wind will continue to be gusty throughout the weekend, knocking wind chills back into the teens and perhaps even single digits first thing in the morning.\n\nWind chills on Saturday will keep temperatures feeling bitterly cold. Boston Globe\n\nTemperatures continue to trend down with Boston barely reaching the freezing mark on Saturday, with colder temps north and west. Boston Globe\n\nThe cold will cause an icy layer on many lakes and ponds, although it will not be at its required 4 inches or greater depth for safety just yet. Older ice is also weaker, so we have to wait for the new ice to form and grow for the greatest support.\n\nSaturday morning will also mark something we call \u201cperihelion.\u201d This is when the Earth is at its closest to the sun as our planet follows its elliptical orbit orbit. This may seem counter-intuitive since it\u2019s the coldest time of the year, but the angle of the sun is much more important than the changing distance throughout the year.\n\nBut the good news is this weekend means our sunrises start getting earlier, so now we are gaining time in both the afternoon and the morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeekend breakdown\n\nSouthern New England: Look for breezy and cold conditions throughout the weekend with temperatures around 30 degrees, starting near 20 each morning.\n\nWestern Mass.: Look for partly the mostly cloudy skies this weekend with temperatures in the 20s. The winds will continue to be gusty especially in the afternoon both days.\n\nCape and Islands: Look for blustery conditions both Saturday and Sunday. Temperatures will reach near freezing but start in the 20s each morning.\n\nNorthern New England: Wind will be the main weather feature this weekend along with colder temperatures. Readings will be in the 20s during the day and single digits and teens at night.\n\nHighs on Sunday will stick around freezing near Boston. Boston Globe\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "Fast-paced markets, shrinking budgets, and increasing shareholder scrutiny are just a few of the factors piling pressure onto today\u2019s project managers. Projects are also becoming more complex, thanks to the increasing integration of emerging technologies like AI, heightened regulatory requirements, and the necessity for adaptability in volatile economies.\n\nIt is imperative that project managers keep an eye on what is around the corner in the industry so they are prepared to take advantage of new processes or avoid pitfalls. TechRepublic spoke to industry experts to find out the top trends to watch in 2025.\n\nFeatured Partners Advertisement TechRepublic is able to offer our services for free because some vendors may pay us for web traffic or other sales opportunities.

Interest in agile is waning, and many agilists say it is dead. Hybrid projects combine elements of one or more project approaches. For decades, project managers have pragmatically blended processes and practices based on context and specific project needs.\n\nHybrid allows project managers to move away from the binary waterfall-agile world to one where patterns of practice include lean, kanban, and DevOps. Successful project managers must make intentional choices when deciding how to execute their projects.\u201d\n\nSEE: Explore the key features and benefits of hybrid project management.\n\nTrend 2: Squad-based teams reduce bureaucracy\n\nJack Skeels, CEO of training firm AgencyAgile\n\n\u201cThe shift to squad-based teams reflects growing dissatisfaction with traditional approaches and the perceived ineffectiveness of agile as it\u2019s often implemented. Leaders and stakeholders are weary of overly complex management structures and expensive project management software tools that fail to deliver meaningful results.\n\nInstead, leaders are embracing simpler, more effective models: small, self-managed teams\u2014typically small squads of five to 15 people. These small teams embody the original spirit of agile by collaborating and getting things done quickly with innovation.\n\nThe model encourages a culture of innovation, collaboration, and responsiveness to change\u2014key traits for businesses competing in fast-paced markets.\u201d\n\nTrend 3: Move to decentralized project management\n\nMolly Beran, founder of project management consultancy Projects By Molly\n\n\u201cI expect to see a lot of organizations re-thinking their approach to creating centralized Project Management Offices. In the past few years, PMOs have been all the rage\u2014companies rush to set them up, build templates and processes, and then usually start to see them slowly wither.\n\nWhy? There are many reasons, of course, but I find that one of the most prevalent reasons is that while there is a rush to stand-up tools and processes, there are rarely enough people skilled in project management to actually use the tools and get the work done.\n\nAlso, in the rush to set up an office, it\u2019s really typical for companies to lose sight of their larger strategic or organizational priorities. In a sense, they get so caught up in creating a centralized PMO that they forget why it exists in the first place\u2014to get the work done that best aligns with the strategic priorities of an organization.\n\nI predict that in 2025 and beyond, companies will start pulling back on centralized PMOs and go back to more decentralized project management, where each department or area has in place experts who understand the core business processes, and also get asked to manage projects.\u201d\n\nSEE: Read TechRepublic\u2019s guide to the top project management certifications.\n\nTrend 4: Focus on AI literacy among project managers\n\nCornelius Fichtner, president of Project Management PrepCast and host of The Project Management Podcast\n\n\u201cProject managers should experience a \u2018rude awakening\u2019 as they recognize the limitations of their current generative AI interactions. The difference between successful and struggling projects hinges primarily on the project manager\u2019s depth of AI understanding.\n\nMany project managers forget that they not only need to use AI on their projects, but they will also be asked to lead projects intended to bring AI capabilities to various departments in their company. They need a really broad and solid understanding of what AI is and can do in order to serve stakeholders from marketing and finance as these departments are augmented with AI.\u201d\n\nSEE: 9 Best AI Project Management Tools for 2024\n\nTrend 5: Accelerated job training through AI\n\nJustin Tan, IT Project Management Office leader at Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\n\u201cImagine AI systems that can instantly generate comprehensive project plans based on the context and conditions, predict potential risks with greater accuracy, optimize resource allocation, and provide contextual decision support that historically required years of professional experience.\n\nJunior professionals without extensive traditional experience will leverage such AI-powered platforms to access institutional knowledge and best practices, effectively compressing years of learning into actionable recommendations\u2014accelerating learning and project execution capabilities.\n\nFrom my experience playing a key role in leading digital transformation initiatives, the most successful organizations will be those that strategically integrate AI not as a replacement for human intelligence, but as a collaborative tool that amplifies human potential.\u201d\n\nSEE: Read more artificial intelligence coverage from TechRepublic.\n\nTrend 6: Resource management software grows in importance\n\nMichele Badie, Professional Development Strategist at Skills Recharged\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue skills-centric resource management discussions, and action plans to connect the right skills to the right tasks while ensuring teams thrive and stay on task. Real-time tools\u2014for example, resource planning software, AI-driven allocation, employee well-being, and collaboration and communication tools\u2014will support making resource allocation seamless.\n\nAt the same time, project managers, as integral parts of the process, will focus on balancing workloads to prioritize mental health and job satisfaction. In 2025, there will continue to be an amplified focus on not just getting the work done\u2014it\u2019s about ensuring your people avoid decision fatigue or burnout and succeed in their roles, too.\u201d\n\nSEE: TechRepublic Premium\u2019s Mental Health Policy.\n\nWill project managers be replaced by AI?\n\nAI is unlikely to replace project managers entirely, but it is reshaping their roles. Research indicates that while AI can automate administrative tasks like scheduling, data collection, and reporting, it lacks severely in other human elements that are essential for effective project management.\n\nThese human elements include making decisions and empathy, which assists with team motivation and conflict resolution\u2014two things project managers do almost daily.\n\nProfessor Adam Boddison, the Chief Executive of Association for Project Management, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cHybrid work environments demand stronger digital communication and leadership skills, while sustainability and diversity initiatives are becoming integral to organisational strategies. Project management is, in effect, future-state planning.\n\n\u201cWith APM research showing that over 50% of businesses anticipate an increase in the number of projects they undertake over the next three years, the importance of the project profession is clear. The role of the skilled project professional will be pivotal across all industries.\u201d\n\nIt has been predicted that 25 million new project professionals will be needed by 2030 to keep up with industry demand.

Explained\n\nCurated By :\n\nNews18.com\n\nEdited By: Shilpy Bisht\n\n\n\nLast Updated: January 02, 2025, 18:05 IST\n\nRussia-Ukraine war refuses to die down with both sides digging their heels in. Israel has devastated Gaza after the October 2023 attack led by Hamas. Syria\u2019s civil war took a shocking turn with rebels ousting Bashar al-Assad. A brutal civil war has broken out in... Read More\n\nSyrian opposition fighters celebrate after the Syrian government collapsed in Damascus, Syria, on December 8, 2024. (AP Photo)\n\nThe Ukraine-Russia war that began in February 2022 led to a series of conflicts for various reasons in different parts of the world, including Israel, Gaza, Syria, Sudan and Myanmar, taking a huge toll on not only the stakeholders, but the world at large.\n\nWill 2025 continue to witness the rage or will be there an end to this violence? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nrelated stories\n\nWhat Is The Status Of The Gaza War?\n\nGaza Strip, which is small territory along the Mediterranean Sea, became the hotbed of violence in October 2023 when Palestinian extremist group Hamas unleashed attacks on Israel, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities in the area.\n\nAbout 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. More than 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry said.\n\nOn January 1, 2025, Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children, officials said. Israel\u2019s military said it \u201celiminated\" Hamas fighters.\n\nDefense Minister Israel Katz has warned that Hamas will \u201csuffer blows of a magnitude not seen in Gaza for a long time\" if it doesn\u2019t release the remaining hostages and stop firing at Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military has stated quite often that it only targets militants and has blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army said it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nSome 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million have been displaced, many of them multiple times, due to the war.\n\nThe US and Arab mediators have spent nearly a year trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release, but those efforts have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting truce, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until \u201ctotal victory.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in November issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former defence chief Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe war has impacted Israeli citizens. More than 82,000 Israelis moved abroad in 2024 and 33,000 people immigrated to the country, Israel\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics said. Another 23,000 Israelis returned after long periods abroad.\n\nBut there is a chance that the war could end this year. Donald Trump had told Netanyahu that he wanted the conflict to end before he returns to the White House on January 20. After he was declared a winner, Trump had said in his address that he wants all wars to end.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly said Israel will keep hold of Gaza for the \u201cforeseeable future\" after the war ends. He also wants the Palestinian Authority to take a role in Gaza\u2019s administration.\n\nJosef Federman, Associated Press\u2019 news director (Israel-Palestinian territories-Jordan), said there are signs that the war is in its final stages. \u201cBut even if it ends, I don\u2019t see how anybody would want to invest into rebuilding Gaza again, given the history where every three or four years there is another war where all your work gets destroyed. So for them to get investment this time on that the scale that\u2019s needed, there are going to have to be some big changes in the way people think.\"\n\nIs Putin Ending The Ukraine Conflict?\n\nExperts predict that Russian President Vladimir Putin could up the ante against Ukraine as he would be set to reclaim the territories that were once part of the Soviet Union.\n\nProfessor Anthony Glees from the University of Buckingham told the Mirror that Putin is unlikely to be satisfied with a peace deal imposed by the West and aim for further expansion, targeting post-1997 NATO states.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, Putin will advance his strategic plan to undermine and force post-1997 NATO states, including Poland, Finland, and the Baltic nations, to leave the alliance,\" Glees warns. He told the Mirror that this \u201cbig grab\" could cause a global war.\n\nWith Trump promises his electorate to end the Ukraine war within a day by negotiating a peace deal, reports suggest his plan may embolden Putin rather than deter him. Trump proposed deal includes freezing the current front lines, establishing a buffer zone, and delaying Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership by 20 years.\n\nAs per Kyiv Independent, Putin had said Russia would agree to a ceasefire and peace talks only if Ukraine withdrew from Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia and disavowed its goal of joining the North-Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Putin has also demanded that Ukraine acknowledge Crimea and Sevastopol as Russian territory.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Kyiv declares readiness for such a decision and begins a real withdrawal of troops, as well as officially abandons its NATO ambitions, we will immediately cease fire and begin negotiations,\" Putin had said at the time.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, and since then, Moscow has made steady gains in eastern Ukraine. Russian troops have taken over 30 square kilometres of Kyiv\u2019s territory.\n\nUkraine had responded to Russia\u2019s offensive by using US long-range Army Tactical Missile System. Though experts insist that Kyiv being given permission to use these missiles is not a game changer, Moscow has responded by lowering its threshold for using nuclear weapons.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose term was due to end in May 2024 has been extended due to martial law. He would need to be re-elected for Russia to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, Putin had said.\n\nSamya Kullab, Associated Press correspondent in Ukraine, told the Guardian that the situation is far different from when the war began. \u201cThe jubilation and the joy from those initial moments has kind of turned into this incredible feeling of gloom and coming to terms with what we\u2019ve always known \u2014 that Ukraine is at a terrible disadvantage. I would describe it as being bled out slowly,\" Kullab wrote.\n\nEuropean Union leaders believe Ukraine needs to hold on and maybe placate Trump to open ideas for negotiations with Russia. The EU will have to continue to sanction individuals and companies in Russia.\n\nWho Is In Charge In Syria After The Government Collapse?\n\nIn Syria, protests began against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad, who came to power in 2000. Pro-democracy protesters during the peak of Arab Spring in 2011 took to the streets in Syria, calling for the ouster of the dictator. But the movement was crushed by Assad\u2019s forces, leading to the establishment of small militias and armed opposition groups from the Syrian military.\n\nAs anti-establishment forces grew, the Syrian allies stepped up support. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards and Lebanon\u2019s proxy Hezbollah helped the armed rebel groups, while Russia bolstered the Syrian Air Force with warplanes. Soon, al-Qaeda started taking interest in the cause of Syria\u2019s opposition forces. By 2014, extremists, including ISIS swept the country.\n\nThe US then created the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 comprising Kurdish fighters \u2013 to eliminate ISIS without confronting the Syrian regime. The SDF fought against the ISIS and ended their territorial existence in Syria. In 2020, Russia and Turkey agreed to a ceasefire in the opposition-held region of Idlib.\n\nIn 2024, the war was triggered by a coalition of rebel forces calling themselves the Military Operations Command. They swept through the villages outside Aleppo\u2014the second largest city in Syria \u2013 and eventually seized Damascus \u2013 the capital city.\n\nAssad has vowed that Syria will continue \u201cto defend its stability and territorial integrity in the face of all terrorists and their supporters\". The defence ministry said it was preparing to launch a counteroffensive. \u201cJoint Syrian-Russian warplanes\" have intensified precise strikes on rebel positions, killing and wounding dozens, it said in a statement.\n\nBut some experts have already expressed scepticism over Assad\u2019s chances. Aron Lund of the Century International think tank told CBS, \u201cAleppo seems to be lost for the regime. And a government without Aleppo is not really a functional government of Syria.\"\n\nThey cited the fact that Russia was heavily distracted by the war in Ukraine and that Iran and Hezbollah were left weakened by their conflict against Israel.\n\nThe experts said the rebels had been biding their time for years. \u201cThis has to do with geopolitics and local opportunity,\" Emile Hokayem, senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies told The Washington Post. \u201cThe rebellion at large had regrouped, rearmed and retrained for something like this.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden had called the fall of Assad a \u201cfundamental act of justice\" but also a \u201cmoment of risk and uncertainty,\" and said rebel groups are \u201csaying the right things now\" but the US would assess their actions.\n\nExperts predict that West Asia could see massive changes in 2025. A US official told CNN that developments in Syria mark the collapse of \u201cIran\u2019s artifice\" across the region.\n\nWhatever happens in Syria will have a major impact on its neighbours Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Israel. \u201cIn a matter of weeks, Iran lost its pillars in the Axis of Resistance. After the heavy blow that Hezbollah suffered at the hands of Israel, the fall of Assad is a fatal strike on Iran\u2019s influence efforts in the Middle East,\" Danny Citrinowicz, a non-resident fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Middle East Programs, told Council for Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nWhat\u2019s The Status Of Civil War In Sudan?\n\nThe Sudanese civil war between two military factions, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began in September 2024. It started as a power rivalry between the military heads of the SAF and the RSF, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Hamdan Dagalo respectively. What began as a conflict in the capital city of Khartoum has spread to Omdurman, Bahri, Port Sudan, El Fasher and the Port Sudan cities, as well as the Darfur and Kordofan states.\n\nThe war is taking place as both warring parties are adamant about gaining ground and legitimising their power. The SAF, which came to power through a coup in 2021, claims to be the legitimate government, with the UN just about recognising them. However, the RSF has territorial gains around the capital and other war zones. It opposes the SAF\u2019s efforts to represent Sudan internationally, claiming legitimacy. The RSF, a former Arab militia known as Janjaweed, seeks alliances from several Arab countries to support its claim to power.\n\nSudan has been under the UN arms embargo, since the 2004 Darfur crisis, which has been now been extended for another year. However, the embargo has not blocked the flow of weapons. A Human Rights Watch report in July claimed that the warring parties have been using armed drones, anti-tank guided missiles, truck-mounted multi-barrel rocket launchers, and mortar munitions produced by companies registered in China, Iran, Russia, Serbia, and the UAE.\n\nAround nine rounds of peace talks led by the US and Saudi Arabia have been held, but all failed in the initial stage. The latest round of US-led peace talks was held in Geneva, Switzerland, on August 14, 2024. But, neither of the warring parties attended.\n\nAny new administration ruling Sudan would be a challenge to the internationally recognised and army-led national government which was forced out of Khartoum last year and now operates on the Red Sea coast in Port Sudan. A group of civilian politicians and armed group leaders have agreed to set up a \u201cpeace government\", RSF members told Reuters.\n\nThey said it would be civilian-led, independent of the RSF and set up to replace the government in Port Sudan which they accused of prolonging the war.\n\nThe civil has impacted several regions, with more than 2 million people seeking shelter in neighbouring Chad, South Sudan and Ethiopia. The refugee camps are overflown and have raised concerns in Europe that many will attempt to reach the continent. In February, dozens of Sudanese drowned when a migrant boat capsized along the Tunisia-Italy route. A lack of law and order has triggered ethnic clashes along the South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea borders. More than 100 deaths were reported in ethnic violence in the Abiey region, a disputed land between Sudan and South Sudan, according to the UN.\n\nThere is a fear that the military rivals would divide Sudan, leading to a similar situation in Libya. Unlike Ukraine and Gaza, the Sudanese war has not gained international traction, but the repercussions have been the same \u2014 fatalities, fear and destroyed livelihood.\n\nWhere Does Myanmar Stand In 2025?\n\nThe ongoing civil war in Myanmar, since the military toppled the civilian government in 2021, has killed more than 50,000 people and displaced around 3 million.\n\nThe fighting between the junta and armed resistance groups in the first two years of the war led to a stalemate while 2024 saw the military on the back foot. With the active Ukraine and Middle East wars, violence in Myanmar conflict has been received global attention.\n\nIn February 2021, the Myanmar\u2019s military staged a coup to overthrow the civilian government\u2014on the same day the parliament is set to swear in the winners of the 2020 election, in which Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won by a landslide. As a result, international condemnation and pro-democracy protests swept across the country, with the junta responding with a brutal crackdown. Nearly 500 were killed in the first two months of the coup.\n\nIn May 2021, the National Unity Government (NUG), comprising ousted lawmakers, protesters and ethnic minorities, announced its armed wing \u2013 the People\u2019s Defence Force (PDF). But in August, Min Aung Hlaing named himself the Prime Minister, and announced a potential extension to the state of emergency.\n\nIn 2022, resistance forces become more united, with many PDF units and ethnic armies forming partnerships to launch joint attacks against junta troops.\n\nIn October 2023, the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a coalition of ethnic armies, launched \u2018Operation 1027\u2019, seizing control of key areas from the military, marking a key victory for the resistance and a turning point in the war.\n\nIn January 2024, China brokered ceasefire between junta and the Three Brotherhood Alliance. But the junta announced mandatory conscription for all men between 18 and 35 years old and all women between 18 and 27 in February. The embattled military proposed a peace agreement with the resistance in September, urging them to \u201csolve political problems politically,\" but it is widely snubbed by the NUG.\n\nRebels in December took control of the country\u2019s western border with Bangladesh after insurgents of the Arakan Army (AA) drove out the junta\u2019s Border Guard Police (PGP5) in northern Rakhine State. The 270 km border with Bangladesh is now governed by the rebels.\n\nThe AA will likely be the first insurgent group to take complete control of a state in Myanmar, as per BBC.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nMyanmar\u2019s neighbours are tense. Thailand in December held talks to resolve the political crisis. The meeting was attended by foreign ministers and high-level representatives from Myanmar as well as Laos, China, India, Bangladesh and host Thailand. But experts think the approach is unlikely to fructify.\n\nDavid Scott Mathieson, an independent analyst working on conflict and human rights issues on Myanmar, told Deutsche Welle, \u201cUnless the Myanmar military is serious about peace, these talks will be extremely limited. You can\u2019t approach any diplomacy on Myanmar without a clear understanding that the military is the root cause of all the problems.\"\n\nFirst Published: January 02, 2025, 18:04 IST"

            "article_content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The following is a guest post from Ang Troy, senior director analyst at Gartner.\n\nMost IT organizations have cloud services in place or have made conscious decisions regarding its adoption. Such decisions may include adopting the cloud quickly and wholly, to proceed methodically with cloud services or to delay for a period of time.\n\nIn any of these strategies, IT organizations face major obstacles building, deploying, consuming, managing, securing and integrating cloud services.\n\nThe adoption of cloud computing is multidimensional, and it must be run like a multiyear program, not a fixed-duration project. As a result, the complexity of cloud adoption requires at least one accountable architectural leader to guide the organization through the transformation. This is the task of a role that many IT organizations are now finding to be mandatory: the enterprise cloud architect.\n\nMany organizations can clearly point to their lead enterprise cloud architect, but others have yet to formally name this individual or have piled the cloud responsibilities onto an already overburdened enterprise architect. Organizations that are the most successful have formally assigned cloud architecture responsibilities to ensure that a single, accountable architect is in charge.\n\nWhat is an enterprise cloud architect?\n\nAn enterprise cloud architect is responsible for the cloud computing initiatives in an organization and for directing the architectural aspects of the cloud team across all aspects of IT and the business.\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect should be the foundation of a cloud center of excellence, or what will become the CCOE \u2014 the enterprise architecture function that governs the organization\u2019s approach to the cloud.\n\nCommon alternative names for a CCOE include: the cloud business office, the cloud transformation office, the cloud brokerage team and the cloud enablement team.\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect is usually a senior individual contributor who serves as the leader of the CCOE \u2014 or, if there is no cloud EA function, then as the leader of cloud initiatives.\n\nOften, the role of the enterprise cloud architect is largely self-directed, and day-to-day responsibilities are usually fluid. The specific tasks vary, depending on the level of the organization\u2019s cloud maturity and the maturity of its CCOE.\n\nEnterprise cloud architects are typically not \u201chands-on.\u201d They will make decisions, but hand off responsibility for their technical implementation to a cloud engineering function. Cloud technical architects may be hands-on, but they are associated with the cloud engineering function, not the CCOE.\n\nWhere cloud sits in the organization\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect is the foundation of the CCOE, and may be the only member of this hub in some organizations.\n\nCompanies may not have a structured center of excellence in name, and may rely on the enterprise cloud architect to effectively assume the role of this center. This is a common and acceptable practice, though Gartner recommends building out the CCOE with additional members.\n\nRegardless of the organizational design, the enterprise cloud architect has six key relationships:\n\nAdvisory-level access to senior IT leaders, either directly or through the EA team Direct and collaborative access to senior EA teams Direct and collaborative access to domain architecture teams Collaborative access to technical architects and teams Collaborative access to central function architects and teams Collaborative access to business unit representatives to discern business needs for specific solutions\n\nSkill sets of enterprise cloud architects\n\nDue to the broad applicability of cloud computing in an organization, it\u2019s unlikely that any individual will possess all the skills that the enterprise cloud architect role demands. However, the enterprise cloud architect should possess as many of the desired skills as possible.\n\nWhere a specific skill is lacking, the enterprise cloud architect should be able to collaborate or engage the relevant, resident experts in the organization. For example, if the enterprise cloud architect does not have a skill or strength in IT service management (ITSM), that individual needs to build a strong relationship with an ITSM expert to drive objectives to completion.\n\nAt the core, enterprise cloud architects are enterprise architects. Therefore, they need to have the competencies of good enterprise architects in order to drive business outcomes, empower business partners and develop and build effective architecture disciplines\n\nCloud computing is not a matter of \u201cif\u201d; it\u2019s a matter of \u201chow.\u201d Adopting cloud services is similar to a complex IT program that has no clear end in sight. Guiding cloud adoption requires strong leadership, not just at an executive level, but also at an architectural level.\n\nEnterprise cloud architects are paramount to the eventual success of cloud adoption. Organizations should not delay placing the right individual into this crucial IT role."

            "article_content": "When many people hear the word \u201ccamp,\u201d images of summer excursions full of hiking, canoeing, craft making and new friends leap to mind. And, while Camp Susque certainly offers those things, the organization also functions as a beacon of community goodwill.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we struggle with is, there\u2019s that impression. Some people ask, \u2018what do you do the rest of the year?\u2019 We are a year round camp. There is always something going on at Susque,\u201d said Peter Swift, executive director for the camp for the past 10 years.\n\nSwift\u2019s family has a long history with the camp, dating back to 1947, when his grandfather, Bob Dittmar, founded the camp. In the 1990\u2019s, Swift\u2019s parents filled the very role he holds today, and his younger brother is the current operations director.\n\n\u201cWe have a deep and inviting love for the ministry, so my family just keeps coming back,\u201d Swift said.\n\nSome of the more traditional camp-oriented offerings Susque is known for include overnight residential and family summer camps, wilderness trips during the summer and short term \u201ctry it out\u201d camps for younger kids.\n\n\u201cWe like to be a resource to the community anytime there\u2019s any kind of crisis, especially locally in Trout Run, whether it\u2019s weather related, like the hurricane this summer, or whether it\u2019s an extended power outage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe camp was instrumental in helping area residents stay connected in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, as schoolwork turned remote.\n\n\u201cWe are blessed with exceptionally good internet, so we set up antennas in our parking lot and offered drive-in WiFi, where students that needed to do remote work, or have a Zoom meeting, but didn\u2019t have the internet, could just come to our parking lot and do it there,\u201d Swift said.\n\nAdditionally, the camp opened its facilities to healthcare professionals and first responders that may need to self isolate.\n\nDuring the 2020-21 school year, as hybrid learning took hold, working with local school districts and county commissioners, the camp would rent out eight churches throughout the city, during the weekdays, when they are largely empty, and hire 80 staff, starting what they called \u201cschool learning sites,\u201d Swift explained.\n\n\u201cWe ended up serving more kids that fall than we would have through our summer camps,\u201d he said.\n\nThe initiative was a win-win for the camp.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a Christian organization, and for us, that was an opportunity to do gospel ministry, to connect with these kids. We included Bible studies as an optional part of it. We gave kids the option to opt out. We didn\u2019t want to force our beliefs on anyone,\u201d Swift said.\n\n\u201cOur mission is Biblical evangelism and growth of Christian character for youth, young adults and families, and finding a way to do that in the midst of the pandemic was really cool. And we put it together in two weeks,\u201d Swift said, proudly.\n\nMore recently, the camp was heavily involved in recovery efforts following the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene.\n\n\u201cThis summer, when there was the hurricane and Trout Run was flooding, we hosted families that were displaced and we provided laundry and shower facilities,\u201d Swift explained.\n\n\u201cWe have good backup generators and internet and things like that, so it\u2019s a good and safe place to come, if you, for some reason, can\u2019t be in your home,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the firehall not yet fully operational, the camp has taken on several of its normal services, including hosting Red Cross blood drives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been involved with disaster relief. The fire company knows that if there\u2019s a family that\u2019s displaced, they can come to Susque,\u201d Swift said.\n\nCamp Susque\u2019s reach extends far beyond the bounds of home, as they partnered with Heather Newhart, of Compassion Campers, and others to purchase and send 29 RVs to Tennessee and North Carolina to house families displaced by Helene\u2019s affects.\n\n\u201cA number of our staff have driven the RVs down there, and they\u2019re doing that on their own dime,\u201d Swift said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking time off from work. They\u2019re paying for gas. It\u2019s been a pretty amazing thing to see,\u201d he said.\n\nA big part of fulfilling the camp\u2019s mission and community outreach has been securing a way for each prospective camper to meet the sometimes hefty cost of enrollment.\n\n\u201cWe are about 1/5 of the national average when it comes to cost for residential camps, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re cheap,\u201d Swift said, explaining that the average cost per camper is around $600, while the national average is closer to $3,000.\n\n\u201cWe only collect around $350 to $400 after discounts, financial aid and scholarships, and that gap is primarily made up for by our community and our alumni making donations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe never want someone to avoid coming to camp because of the price. We do not turn people down for financial aid,\u201d Swift stressed.\n\n\u201cWe want everybody to have that opportunity. We want to encourage people, don\u2019t be daunted by the sticker price,\u201d he said.\n\nThose opportunities continue to grow as Swift and co. continue to pursue new ways to serve the community, as they wrap up a capital campaign for the construction of a new handicap accessible pool.\n\nA gap year program for recent high school graduates to take the time to decide their next path in life before entering college or the workforce is also under development by Camp Susque at two properties they acquired during the pandemic, Swift said.\n\n\u201cIn the interim, we\u2019ve primarily been providing either emergency housing or respite housing for families with domestic issues or pastoral retreats,\u201d he said.\n\nSwift credits the success of the camp to its staff as well as its alumni base.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of our staff, both our year round staff and our summer staff. They\u2019re just the highest quality,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd our alumni are incredible. I\u2019m always amazed by them. We\u2019ve been around for 77 years now, and I\u2019m really impressed by the Susque community and how generous they are with their time, their talents and their wallets,\u201d Swift said.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that surprises a lot of people about Susque is that we don\u2019t have an endowment, we\u2019re not affiliated with a church. It\u2019s just the community and our alumni base that takes care of us,\u201d he explained.\n\nAdditionally, Swift gives great credit to the camp\u2019s continued dedication to the word of God.\n\n\u201cOur mission has remained consistent, and I think as long as we faithfully and doggedly pursue that mission, God provides for us through his people and we\u2019re very blessed to be able to kind of a front row seat for all of that,\u201d he said."

The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it?

The video has since gone viral on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where users are divided between humorous interpretations and more serious discussions about the potential implications of the footage.\n\nUsers Reaction to the Viral Post\n\nThe most conclusive explanation of the video was given by a twitter user with an image and he said that, \u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks.\u201d\n\nAnother one said, \u201cThat\u2019s wild.

            "article_content": "With global interest in UFOs at an all-time high, particularly in the United States where mysterious drone sightings have been driving everyone crazy, two Israeli researchers have uncovered fascinating patterns in who reports these mysterious sightings \u2014 and when.\n\nTheir study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, reveals that UFO reports might tell us less about what\u2019s in the sky and more about what\u2019s happening on the ground, particularly in our bank accounts.\n\nOhad Raveh from Hebrew University and Nathan Goldstein from Bar-Ilan University were trying to solve an interesting puzzle: How can we measure what the public is paying attention to in different places and at different times? This is important for understanding the economy, but it\u2019s difficult to measure.\n\nThey looked at years of data cataloguing recorded sightings of UFOs \u2014 or as they refer to them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena).\n\nTheir assumption was that when people report seeing something strange in the sky, they\u2019re clearly paying attention to their surroundings. The researchers thought this could be a useful way to measure public attention.\n\n\u201c We set out to understand what the association is between attention given to the sky and attention given to the economy,\u201d explains Raveh.\n\nTwo contradictory findings?\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of reports from the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States and discovered that more wealthy areas consistently report more UFO sightings than less wealthy regions.\n\nRaveh and Goldstein initially believed that this phenomenon could be explained by understanding attention as a hierarchical system: you give attention to the most pressing issues before you worry about other things.\n\n\u201cOnce you give attention to the fundamental things, then you may give attention to things that are more luxurious,\u201d Raveh elaborates. \u201cAttention to the economy is a fundamental thing, because in the end that\u2019s what brings food to your table. But once you attend to that, then you have more time on your hands to start looking at the sky.\u201d\n\nSo, because people who are more financially secure can let their minds (and eyes) wander from their budgets, they\u2019re more likely to see UAPs, right?\n\nHowever, that theory runs into some turbulence when considering the second pattern they uncovered during their research: Across the board, both poor and wealthy areas saw an increase in UFO sightings during economic downturns \u2013 a pattern that caught the researchers by surprise.\n\n\u201c We thought that the two types of attention would be substitutable. Because attention is a limited resource, and if you give attention to, say, the sky, that would be at the expense of other types of attention that you can give to other factors like the economy,\u201d says Raveh. \u201cBut apparently it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: Wealthy areas generally report more UFOs than poor areas, but when any area hits hard economic times, UFO reports increase.\n\nTurns out rich people get to spend more time looking for aliens. Photo by Jonas Von Werne via Pexels\n\nIt\u2019s all about attention\n\nThis apparent contradiction makes sense when you realize UFO reports are really measuring how much attention people are paying to their surroundings.\n\nWealthy people generally have more free time and mental space to notice unusual things in the sky. But during economic downturns, people everywhere have more time on their hands (often due to job losses or reduced work hours) and thus spot more UFOs.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by what the researchers saw during Covid lockdowns: When people were forcibly given more free time (even if they weren\u2019t necessarily experiencing economic hardship), UFO sightings increased.\n\nOverall, the research findings serve as strong evidence that UFO/UAP sightings serve as a reliable indicator of public attention patterns, which opens new possibilities for understanding how public attention influences economic outcomes.\n\nOnly one question remains, though \u2014 have the researchers seen any UFOs themselves?\n\n\u201c I wish!\u201d jokes Raveh. \u201cActually, since we started to work, I\u2019ve tried to give more attention to the skies. But I haven\u2019t seen anything, unfortunately. I hope they visit Israel sometime.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

            "article_content": "A combination of Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity and quantum physics may help explain the expansion of the universe from a singular entity, P. Ajith, astrophysicist with the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bengaluru, has said.\n\nHe was at the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium (RSCP) in Kozhikode on Thursday (January 2) to deliver a lecture demonstration on \u2018Universe: yesterday, today and tomorrow\u2019. It is the first in the \u2018Cosmic Snapshots\u2019 series of lectures being organised by the RSCP.\n\nMr. Ajith pointed out that the concept of a primordial atom, proposed in the early 20th century by Georges Lemaitre, who is considered the father of the Big Bang theory, was just a \u201cstory\u201d and not a scientific fact. According to Lemaitre, the universe began with an explosion from a single particle at a specific moment in time. \u201cThe primordial atom is just a way of explaining what might have happened. At some point, the universe shrank into one tiny entity. To understand what happened then, we need to combine Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity with quantum physics,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ajith traced the history of our understanding of the universe, starting with Nicolaus Copernicus, who first suggested a sun-centered universe, and Galileo Galilei, who proved it through observations. \u201cGalileo\u2019s discoveries changed how we saw the universe and sparked the age of enlightenment and the Renaissance, leading to modern science and technology,\u201d he said. German astronomer Kepler improved Copernicus\u2019 ideas, discovering that planets move in elliptical orbits. Isaac Newton later proposed that the same force making an apple fall also keeps planets revolving around the Sun.\n\nMr. Ajith highlighted that Newton\u2019s laws of motion are still used today, especially in rocket science. He explained how the sun-centered universe concept evolved, revealing the Sun as just a small part of the Milky Way. Later, astronomers debated whether Earth was part of a single galaxy or many. Edward Hubble then developed a telescope to measure the distance to distant galaxies. Mr. Ajith also mentioned Einstein\u2019s theory, which described gravity not as a force, but as the effect of space-time, a concept he introduced to explain how gravity impacts space and the flow of time."

            "article_content": "The Cuban Revolution was an armed uprising in Cuba that overthrew the government of Fulgencio Batista on January 1, 1959\n\nThe Cuban Revolution was an armed uprising in Cuba that overthrew the government of Fulgencio Batista on January 1, 1959. The revolution\u2019s leader, Fidel Castro, went on to rule Cuba from 1959 to 2008. This article highlights the significance of this revolution and the revolutionary transformation of Latin America.\n\nOne day, Che said to the guerrilla fighters in Bolivia: \u201cThis type of fight gives us the opportunity of becoming revolutionaries, the highest level of the human species, and it also permits us to graduate as men; those that cannot reach either of these two stages should say so and give up the fight.\u201d\n\nThose that fought with them until the end have become worthy of such honours. They symbolise the type of revolutionaries and men whom history is now summoning for a truly hard and difficult task: the revolutionary transformation of Latin America.\n\nThe enemy which faced our forefathers during the first fight for independence was a decadent colonial power. The revolutionaries of today have as their enemy the most powerful bulwark of the imperialist camp, equipped with the most modern techniques and industries. This enemy not, only newly organized equipped the Bolivian army, where the people had destroyed the previous military repressive forces and immediately helped with weapons and military assistants for the fight against the guerrillas, but they also offer military and technical aid to the same degree to all the repressive forces on this continent. And when these measures were not sufficient, they intervened directly with their troops, as they did in Santo Domingo.\n\nThe North American people themselves, who are becoming conscious of the fact that the monstrous political superstructure which prevails in their country is no longer the idyllic. The bourgeois republic established by its founders almost two hundred years ago, is undergoing to an ever greater degree the moral barbarousness of an irrational, obsessed, brutal and inhuman system which engulfs more victims from among the North American people in its aggressive wars, political crimes, racial aberration, niggardly regard for the human being, and the repugnant squandering of economic, scientific and human resources. All these events happen in the middle of a world which is seventy five per cent underdeveloped and hungry.\n\nBut only the revolutionary transformation of Latin America could permit the people of the United States to settle accounts with imperialism itself. At the same time and at the same rate the rising struggle of the North American people against imperialist policy could become a decisive ally of the revolutionary struggle in Latin America.\n\nIf this part of the hemisphere does not undergo a profound revolutionary transformation, the enormous difference and lack of balance at the beginning of the century between this powerful nation - which was rapidly industrialised at the same rate as it progressed by its own law of social and economic dynamics toward imperial heights - and the group of weak and thwarted nations in the other Balkanised part of the American continent will be but a pale reflection. A reflection of not the already great lack of economic, scientific and technical balance which now exists, but of the frightful lack of balance which the imperialist superstructure will impose at a greater speed on the peoples of Latin America in the next twenty years.\n\nThis way we shall become poorer, weaker and more dependent upon and enslaved by imperialism. This dark perspective equally affects the underdeveloped countries of Asia and Africa.\n\nIf the industrialised and well-instructed nations of Europe, with their Common Market and supranational scientific institutions become perturbed by the possibility of getting left behind and contemplate with fear the perspective of being converted into economic colonies of Yankee imperialism, what does the future have to offer to the peoples of Latin America?\n\nIf this real and unquestionable situation decisively affects the destiny of our peoples, some liberal or bourgeois reformist or pseudo-revolutionary charlatan, incapable of action, may have an answer that is not for a profound and urgent revolutionary transformation. It could gather together all the moral, material and human forces to launch them forth in this part of the world in order to recover from the economic and scientific-technical backwardness of centuries, greater when compared to the industrialised world of which we are tributaries, and will continue to be a greater degree, especially of the United States \u2013 and furthermore is able to give the formula, the magic way to accomplish this, different from the way conceived by Che. In turn it can wipe out oligarchies, despots, petty politicians, that is to say, nursemaids, and Yankee monopolies, the masters, and to be able to do it with all the urgency which the situation requires.\n\nChe wrote his last line on October 7. The following day, at 13 hours, in a narrow ravine where he proposed waiting for the night in order to break the encirclement, a large number of enemy troops made contact with them. The reduced number of men of which the detachment was composed on this date, fought heroically until dusk from individual positions located in the bed of the ravine and on the top edges against the mass of soldiers that had surrounded and attacked them. Among those who fought in positions close to Che, there were no survivors. Besides him were the doctor, in a grave state of health, and a Peruvian guerrilla, also in bad condition, which seems to indicate that Che, until wounded, did his utmost to protect the withdrawal of these two comrades to a more secure place. The doctor was not killed during the same battle but several days later at a not very distant point from the Quebrada del Yuro. The abruptness of the rocky irregular terrain made visual contact among the guerrilla fighters very difficult and at times impossible. Those defending the position at the other entrance of the ravine several hundred metres from Che, among them Inti and Coco Peredo, held off the attack until dusk when they managed to get away from the enemy and left for the previously agreed point of contact.\n\nIt has been established that Che continued fighting, though wounded until the barrel of his M-2 rifle was destroyed by a shot, rendering it completely useless. The pistol he was carrying had no magazine. These incredible circumstances explain how he could have been captured alive. The wounds in his legs kept him from walking without help but they were not fatal.\n\nMoved to the town of Higueras, he lived approximately 24 hours more. He refused to exchange words with his captors and a drunken officer who tried to vex him received a slap across the face.\n\nGathered in La Paz, Barrientos, Ovando and other high military chiefs coldly made the decision to assassinate him. The details of the way they proceeded to carry out the treacherous agreement at the school in the town of Higueras are well known. Majo Miguel Ayoroa and Colonel Andres Selnich, rangers trained by the Yankees, instructed officer Mario Teran to proceed with the killing. When the latter, completely drunk, went into the place, Che, who had heard the shots which had just killed a Bolivian and a Peruvian guerrilla fighter, seeing that the assassin vacillated said firmly, \u201cShoot, don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d The latter left and again it was necessary for his superiors, Ayoroa and Selnich, to repeat the order, which he then proceeded to fulfill, firing with his machine-gun from the waist down. Word had already gone around that Che had died several hours after combat and therefore his executors had orders not to shoot at his chest or head so as not to induce fatal wounds. Such a procedure is in brutal contrast to the respect that Che had, without a single exception, for the lives of numerous officials and soldiers of the Bolivian army whom he had taken prisoner.\n\nThe final hours of his existence in the power of his despised enemies must have been very bitter ones for him, but there was no man better prepared than Che to be put to such a test.\n\nThe way that the Diary came into our hands cannot be divulged at the moment; it is enough to say that it required no monetary remuneration. It contains all the notes he wrote from November 7, 1966, the day Che arrived at Nancahuazu, until October 7, 1967, the evening before the combat in the ravine in Yuro. There are only a few pages missing which are not in our hands but they correspond to dates on which nothing of any importance took place and therefore do not alter the content of the Diary in any way.\n\nAlthough there was no doubt as to the authenticity of the document, all the photo static copies were submitted to a rigorous examination for the purpose not only of proving the authenticity but also to check on any possible alteration, no matter how small. Furthermore, the data was compared with the diary of one of the surviving guerrillas. Both documents coincide in all respects. The detailed testimony of the remaining guerrilla survivors who were witnesses to each and every one of the events also contributes to the proof of its authenticity. The conclusion was reached with absolute certainty that all the Photostats were true copies of Che\u2019s Diary.\n\nIt was a fatiguing job to decipher the small and difficult handwriting, a task carried out with the laborious participation of his wife and comrade, Aleida March de Guevara.\n\nThe Diary was published almost simultaneously in France, by the French Editorial Francois Maspero; in Italy by the Editorial Feltrinelli; Trikont Verlag of the German Federal Republic ; the Ramparts Magazine in USA; Ediciones Ruedo Iberico in Spain ; Revista Punto Final in Chile and in other countries."
