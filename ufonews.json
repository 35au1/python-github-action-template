        "article_content": "Ever since the bombshell expos\u00e9 about the US Government\u2019s UFO research program in 2017, the subject of extraterrestrial visitors has moved steadily from the conspiracy world into the mainstream.\n\nIn recent years we have seen military experts testify under oath to the US Congress that the Pentagon conducted a \u201cmulti-decade\u201d program which collected, and attempted to reverse-engineer, crashed alien craft.\n\nBut still, the official government \u201cdisclosure\u201d of contact with aliens \u2013 whether it\u2019s in the form of landings from interstellar craft or the recently-reported \u201cnon-human technological signature\u201d allegedly detected by an Australian radio telescope \u2013 seems as far away as ever.\n\nAnd one leading expert in the field of UFO research has deeply worrying theory on why that might be. Nick Pope, once responsible for the Ministry of Defence's analysis of UFO reports, offered his disturbing explanation to Simon Holland in a leaked email.\n\nSimon made headlines around the world earlier this month when he claimed evidence of alien life has been found by an Oxford-backed satellite programme. He even claimed it could be announced to coincide with the US election on November 5.\n\nImage: wikimedia commons) wikimedia commons)\n\nBut in the email \u2013 which surfaced on Reddit and has been confirmed to the Mirror as being genuine \u2013 Nick suggests that any potential message detected by the extraterrestrial research group should be very carefully analysed before being released to the public \u201cin case it contains a truth too terrible to be told\u201d.\n\nSpeculating on why disclosure has been so long-delayed, with Nick writing: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the US presidential election, or the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East or Ukraine have a bearing on the timescale. One factor that might have a bearing on timing relates to a scenario where the assessment is that we\u2019re looking at not just a signal, but a message.\n\n\u201cIt would be prudent to have a go at decoding the message before making an announcement \u2013 in case it contains a truth too terrible to be told.\u201d\n\nSome of these potential truths he exclusively told the Mirror, include the possibility that humanity is simply \u201ca science experiment\u201d for some advanced civilisation, or that \u201caliens are demonic\u201d.\n\nProfessor Simon Holland described Nick Pope\u2019s speculation as \u201cdeeply disturbing,\u201d and several commentators have put forward the idea that mankind, as a whole, might suffer some sort of collective breakdown as a result of the \u201contological shock\u201d of encountering a truly alien civilisation.\n\nPope has previously commented that humanity, as a whole, might not be psychologically ready to cope with confirmation that non-human intelligence is real. He claimed: \"I believed people were ready for Disclosure. The response to Covid made me rethink this. I overestimated societal resilience, and underestimated the panic generated by something unfamiliar and threatening.\u201d\n\nAnother theory that he has floated in the past is that our reality is little more than an advanced video-game being played by beings so far advanced from us that they may as well be gods.\n\n\u201cOften in cosmology, there seems to be a disconnect between theory and observation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn religious terms, it would be as if several different gods all had a hand in creating the universe, and all had their different styles.\u201d"

        "article_content": "On a recent Sunday night at Katie\u2019s of Smithtown, a group of about a dozen people stood in the dark. But they weren\u2019t in search of a drink \u2014 they were there to find a ghost.\n\nMichael Cardinuto, president of the group Long Island Paranormal Investigators, told guests to turn their phones off and recounted the tale of bartender Charlie Klein, who is said to haunts Katie\u2019s. There are stories of glasses flying off the bar and tables, and the sound of unexplained footsteps.\n\nFrom left, Tanya Leib at a weekly meeting of the Long Island Paranormal Investigators in Selden. Top right, Michael Cardinuto, seated at center, with members of the group. Bottom right, some of the equipment members use to conduct their investigations. Credit: Newsday/Elizabeth Sagarin\n\nCardinuto then led the group \u2014 a mix of guests and other paranormal investigators \u2014 past a poster for the A&E show \u201cParanormal,\u201d which filmed at Katie\u2019s in 2008, as he pointed a flashlight down a wide, green staircase to the basement.\n\nHe interrogated a possible ghost, asking questions of the air and hoping to capture on video, tape recorder or EchoVox app signs that something supernatural might be present.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty quiet,\u201d said Cardinuto, 44, of Selden. But he was undaunted: \u201cConsider it like fishing. You throw in your line and you hope you catch a fish. Every time I don\u2019t catch something, I still have fun doing it.\u201d\n\nSign up for the NewsdayTV newsletter From breaking news to special features and documentaries, the NewsdayTV team is covering the issues that matter to you. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\n\nInterest in ghosts has become more mainstream, with shows like the Travel Channel\u2019s \u201cGhost Hunters\u201d and \u201cParanormal Caught on Camera\u201d showcasing mysterious phenomena around the world. There\u2019s also the \u201cLong Island Medium,\u201d Theresa Caputo, who claims to communicate with spirits.\n\nBut while ghost hunting may be Halloween entertainment for some, for those who believe in the paranormal \u2014 essentially anything that doesn\u2019t have a scientific explanation \u2014 it\u2019s a constant search for validation that there is indeed a reality beyond ours.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do it for entertainment purposes. We\u2019re documenting everything that happens, whether we capture something or not,\u201d Cardinuto said. \u201cI never expect to find anything. When it does happen, it happens.\u201d\n\nTHE NEW PARANORMAL\n\nWhether or not ghosts exist, what is certain is the popularity of the paranormal. In addition to the many television shows on the subject, there are lectures, documentaries and conventions, including The Warren\u2019s Seekers of the Supernatural Paracon in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Long Island Paranormal Investigators has grown from 17 dues-paying members five years ago to 33 today, and Stony Brook University even has a paranormal club.\n\n\u201cBack 25 years ago if you were into this, you kept it hush hush,\u201d said Cardinuto, who attended the latest Gettysburg convention in September. \u201cNow you keep it very open.\u201d\n\nAuthor and historian Kerriann Flanagan Brosky, of Huntington, had already written two books about the town\u2019s history, both of which included ghost stories, when her father died in 2005.\n\nKerriann Flanagan Brosky and paranormal investigator Joe Giaquinto at the Hallockville Museum Farm in Riverhead. Credit: Elizabeth Sagarin\n\n\u201cI had always been interested in the paranormal, even as a child,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter my father died my husband suggested I get involved in another book project to help get me past the grief I was feeling.\u201d\n\nShe said people who attended her lectures had encouraged her to write a book combining local history and ghost stories. \u201cSo at that point I decided to do so.\u201d\n\nBrosky has since written several books about the paranormal, including \u201cThe Ghosts of Long Island,\u201d \u201cHistoric Haunts of Long Island,\u201d \u201cHaunted Long Island Mysteries\u201d and \u201cHistoric Crimes of Long Island.\u201d\n\n\u201cI interview people about their experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are legitimate people. The stories combine history.\u201d\n\nBrosky often teams with paranormal investigator Joe Giaquinto, of West Sayville, on lectures and investigations at libraries, historical societies and other locations.\n\n\u201cWhat better way to teach local history than through a ghost story?\u201d Brosky said. \u201cI\u2019m a historian first, a ghost investigator second.\u201d\n\nCardinuto sets up a sensor during the investigation at Katie's of Smithtown. Credit: Elizabeth Sagarin\n\nLOOKING FOR EVIDENCE\n\nCardinuto said religion started him on the road to the paranormal. \u201cI always questioned, \u2018Is there a God?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cDo you just die and that\u2019s it?\u201d\n\nWhen he was 23, he said he and a few friends took a video camera to the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, which operated from 1885 to 1996 and is said to be haunted. (State parks officials recently announced stepped-up patrols on the property starting Oct. 30 to discourage people from visiting the remaining buildings, which are not safe to enter.)\n\nDuring Cardinuto\u2019s visit two decades ago, he said his friends went in, heard a bang before the camera turned off on its own, and ran out. While many things could have caused both, Cardinuto said he began looking into the paranormal.\n\n\u201cWe bought some stuff (equipment used in paranormal investigations) and started looking up some locations on Long Island,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to see what people were experiencing at these locations. We started investigating.\u201d\n\nTwenty-one years and 850 investigations later, Cardinuto said he has visited many sites on Long Island that are believed by some to be haunted, including Lake Ronkonkoma, where an Indigenous princess\u2019 spirit is said to return each year to claim the life of a young man.\n\n\u201cThrough investigation and capturing evidence, a lot through audio, I feel there\u2019s something I can\u2019t explain,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we die, there is something.\u201d\n\nNIGHT HIKES\n\nParanormal investigator Daniel Hoffman, 40, of Floral Park, remembers waking one night, startled at the sight of a figure balanced on the edge of his bed that he said vanished as he woke.\n\n\u201cI jumped out of my bed and turned my light on,\u201d Hoffman, a Federal Express courier, said during a Long Island Paranormal Investigators meeting in the basement of Ciro\u2019s Nice Italian Barbershop in Selden.\n\nAfter that experience, he recalled, \u201cI was becoming curious about the paranormal. Then I saw \u2018Ghost Hunters.\u2019 \u201d He realized, he said, \u201cThere were teams that do this.\u201d\n\nHoffman and other investigators often go on night hikes and visit places believed to be haunted, searching for signs of something supernatural.\n\nThe members are serious about the work they do, but they also have a sense of humor \u2014 like the moment when an electronic scream filled the room during the meeting.\n\n\u201cThat was my notification,\u201d said Bianca Perricone, 34, of Shirley, who also goes by Medium Bianca Rose. \u201cMy phone screamed to notify me that I got a text message.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Long Island Paranormal Investigators at a weekly meeting. Credit: Elizabeth Sagarin\n\nCAPTURING THE SIGNS\n\nParanormal investigators apply scientific principles to occurrences that don\u2019t necessarily have clear, scientific proof. They often use ultraviolet cameras, motion sensors, Geiger counters, barometers, thermometers and video and tape recorders in their work.\n\n\u201cThe theory behind it is when a ghost is manifested, it will give off some type of radiation,\u201d Cardinuto said. \u201cWe use Geiger counters to detect all sorts of radiation.\u201d\n\nAttuned to any anomaly, paranormal investigators capture flickering lights, footstep-like sounds, objects moving and appearances that they believe are evidence of apparitions.\n\n\u201cWe look for orbs, which are light anomalies that appear on images that are thought to be spirits,\u201d Brosky said. \u201cIt comes in and out of the frame, so it\u2019s not a dust particle.\u201d\n\nEquipment can capture electrical and other phenomena, which they take as reinforcing the possibility, if not necessarily proof, of things.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very big on trying to debunk things,\u201d said Cardinuto, who by day works with people with special needs. \u201cEven when somebody captures something in our group today, we play it and try to debunk.\u201d\n\nFear can fuel feelings and lead people to hear or imagine things that may not be there, the way someone who falls asleep watching a horror movie can have nightmares, Cardinuto said. Still, he talked about \u201cunexplained\u201d voices and images, including sounds he said his group picked up at the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe in Shoreham, which was damaged in a fire last year. \u201cWe captured some audio evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cVoices captured on audio not there at the time of the investigation.\u201d\n\nMembers do free house investigations for people who say they heard or saw disturbing things, he said. He estimated they have conducted between 100 and 125 investigations. About 20% of the time, he said they detect signs of possible paranormal activity.\n\n\u201cYou look in someone\u2019s eyes and you see the fear,\u201d Cardinuto said. \u201cThey have no one else to turn to.\u201d\n\n\n\nHAUNTED BY HISTORY\n\nSarah Kautz, executive director of the Southampton History Museum, said the facility has hosted paranormal investigations and welcomes groups like Cardinuto\u2019s to help pique visitors\u2019 interest in history.\n\n\u201cWe get folks coming to the museum who wouldn\u2019t come to the museum for any other reason,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sort of tricks you into learning history.\u201d\n\nHalloween is, unsurprisingly, a popular time for such events. But Kautz said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just about ghost hunting. You learn about science. They use some really cool stuff. You learn about the history of the site.\u201d\n\nCardinuto\u2019s Gateway laptop has a Halloween-like ghost on it, but he, Brosky and others passionate about the paranormal are ambivalent about the Halloween rush. \u201cI love Halloween. It\u2019s skeletons and ghosts and witches,\u201d Cardinuto said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I do.\u201d\n\nBrosky said she believes there\u2019s a hunger for information about the supernatural. \u201cPeople love ghost stories,\u201d she said. \u201cI take the creepiness out of them. What we do is positive. It\u2019s not negative, not demonic. It\u2019s not Hollywood.\u201d\n\nShe understands the reaction some have to discussions of the paranormal: \u201cIf people want to be skeptics, they can be skeptics,\u201d she said. But, Brosky added, \u201cThere are things that can\u2019t be explained.\u201d\n\nShe talks about \u201cundoing perceptions of ghosts and spirits\u201d as demonic forces. \u201cThey\u2019re not out to kill or possess you,\u201d Brosky said. \u201cLong Island is more than the \u2018Amityville Horror.\u2019 We\u2019re rich in history.\u201d\n\nKautz said the world is full of enough that\u2019s difficult to explain to prompt curiosity. \u201cCan you hear something that sounds like a voice on a frequency we can\u2019t hear with our human ears?\u201d Kautz asked. \u201cUsually, you can find something weird. Explaining it isn\u2019t that easy.\u201d\n\nWhile Cardinuto said he\u2019s searching for possible evidence of the paranormal, members of Long Island Paranormal Investigators do come away with something definite: \u201cThere is an experience you have.

        "article_content": "A major discovery in Iraq\u2019s historic Babylon Governorate is a significant breakthrough in better understanding the evolution of the ancient city.\n\nThere are parts of the excavation site that date back to the Sasanian Empire of the 3 rd through 7 th centuries, but a majority of the best-preserved parts of the site are remnants of the Old Babylonian era of over 3,000 years ago.\n\nthrough 7 centuries, but a majority of the best-preserved parts of the site are remnants of the Old Babylonian era of over 3,000 years ago. In addition to physical structures remaining from the ancient civilization, there were plenty of individual artifacts discovered, including ancient seals and cuneiform tablets.\n\nFor most archaeologists, discovering a single ancient artifact is probably a thrilling experience. Finding three? A monumental moment. 10? A dream come true.\n\nWhat about nearly 500?\n\nIs there a feeling that can even capture the magnitude? To find out, you\u2019d have to ask Quhtan Abbas Hassan Aboud, the lead on an archaeological excavation in Iraq\u2019s Babylon Governorate. In mid-October, the team\u2014working on a dig in the Al-Fayadiya district\u2014discovered a major section of ancient Babylon that spans two periods of the city\u2019s development. The find contained 478 artifacts from both periods, including ancient seals, cuneiform tablets, and more, according to Archaeology Magazine.\n\nThe team separated the discovery into two sections (A and B), according to a statement from the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage. Section A covered about 6,000 square meters of the excavation site, and within it, archaeologists found remains that represented two distinct time periods. The top layer dates back to the Sasanian period, which stretched from 224 to 651 A.D. during the reign of the Sasanian Empire\u2014one of the last pre-Islamic empires of Iran.\n\nUnfortunately, because they\u2019ve spent a millennium and a half much closer to the surface of the soil, the ruins of the empire suffered plenty of erosion and deterioration. So, while the discovery is key in tracing the history of ancient Babylon, it pales in comparison to what the archaeologists found underneath it.\n\nThe second layer of Section A was much more well-preserved and much, much older\u2014experts traced it back to the Old Babylonian era, which stretched from 1894 to 1595 B.C.\n\nHowever, the excitement around Section B far outshone that for either layer of the first section. Section B was notably larger than Section A, at about 9,000 square meters, and contained a massive bounty of Babylonian antiquities. The whole section dates back to the same era as the lower layer of Section A, and\u2014in addition to the individual artifacts like pottery and cylindrical seals\u2014Aboud\u2019s crew was able to map out what they believed to be residential homes.\n\nRelated Story Archaeologists Find New Ancient Board Game Tablets\n\nTwo housing units that the archaeologists uncovered contained multiple, various-sized rooms that could have served as living spaces, work areas, or storage, providing significant insight into the living habits and conditions of Old Babylon\u2019s common residents.\n\nThe smaller, individual pieces of history\u2014the pottery, writing tablets, seals, and more\u2014that were part of the discovery are just as important as the structures unearthed in the area. The cylindrical seals, for instance, were in pristine condition despite being over 3,000 years old. Once used to sign documents and denote ownership, seals were an important person item and were often ornately decorated. While they served a functional purpose, they also now serve as crucial pieces of the history of aesthetics and symbolism\u2014not just in Babylon, but across ancient Mesopotamia and the rest of the world.\n\nJust as important a find are the various cuneiform tablets. The logo-syllabic writing style is one of the earliest in civilized history, and translations of the ancient Babylonian tablets are essentially windows into the civilization\u2019s commerce, government, and other facets of life. They provide a direct path to better understanding the ancient city.\n\nBut then again, so does the entire discovery. How lucky."

These processors, built in the 1990s, are often unable to meet the modern demands of businesses, leading to fragmented solutions and significant reconciliation issues.\n\nIn contrast, Finix has positioned itself as a \u2018flexible\u2019 and \u2018future-proof\u2019 alternative for businesses of all sizes, especially those without in-house development teams.\n\nAddressing the shortage of engineering resources and the competitive landscape for developer talent, Finix has developed a suite of no-code/low-code payment solutions.\n\nIt aims to continue driving innovation in the payments sector with features such as no-code/low-code capabilities, omnichannel support, multinational capabilities, and real-time payouts.\n\nIn February this year, Finix launched its unified payment suite in Canada through a partnership with Peoples Trust Company, part of Peoples Group.\n\n\"Payment processor Finix secures $75m in Series C funding\" was originally created and published by Electronic Payments International, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\n\n"

Since 2019-20, the Indian space industry\u2019s growth has picked up pace as the government has gone about opening the sector for more private activities, liberalising investments norms, and coming up with a space policy and rules and guidelines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the fund will \u201chave a phenomenal impact on the youth\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt will give opportunities to several innovative minds and add momentum to our space programme,\u201d said Modi further.\n\nhttps://x.com/narendramodi/status/1849456201131847711\n\nHere is how the VC fund is expected to help India\u2019s space ambitions take flight.\n\n1. 40 start-ups to be supported over next five years\n\nThe Rs 1,000 crore fund will be utilised over the next five years to support around 40 space start-ups, said the Cabinet in a statement.\n\nThe average deployment amount could be Rs 150-250 crore per year depending on the investment opportunities and fund requirements, said the statement.\n\nAs for the break-up of funds disbursed in a year, Rs 10-60 crore are expected to be invested in a start-up.\n\n\u201cThe indicative range of investment is proposed to be Rs 10-60 crore, contingent upon the stage of the company, its growth trajectory, and its potential impact on national space capabilities. Indicative Equity Investment Range could be: Rs 10-30 crore for growth Stage and Rs 30-60 crore for late growth stage,\u201d said the Cabinet statement following the approval.\n\n2. The multiplier effect\n\nCapital infusion into start-ups is expected to drive a multiplier effect in the Indian space industry as a whole.\n\nThe investment in selected start-ups is expected to lead to additional funding for later-stage development. This is expected to instil confidence in private investors.\n\nAs selected start-ups will work on scaling up manufacturing and services, several indirect jobs as well as investment opportunities are expected to be created across the entire supply chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Boost to India\u2019s \u2018aatmanirbhar\u2019 ambitions\n\nThe fund is also set to boost India\u2019s ambition to be \u2018aatmanirbhar\u2019 (self-reliant) in critical sectors like space.\n\nThe creation of the fund will lead to the retention of space companies domiciled within India and countering the trend of Indian companies domiciling abroad, said the Cabinet in the statement.\n\n4. Help reach target of 5x growth of space sector\n\nIndia\u2019s space economy is currently pegged at around $8.4 billion and the Modi government seeks to grow it five times to $44 billion over the next decade. The VC fund is expected to be a key step in the direction of the space growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the space sector itself is quite new in India, so many of the companies are also start-ups instead of traditional companies. This means that much of the growth of India\u2019s space sector will also be led by start-ups. Therefore, support to start-ups will go a long way in the growth of India\u2019s space economy.\n\nIndia currently has around 250 space start-ups, according to Reuters.\n\nAcross the world, Indian space start-ups are known for cost-effective services and manufacturing solutions. The space start-ups also provide services to communications, agriculture, and commodities, where high-quality data is a precious resource, as per the news agency.\n\nThe agency further reported that private equity (PE) investment in the Indian space industry has risen by 7 per cent from $118 million in 2022 to $126 million raised in 2023 and by 235 per cent from $37.6 million raised in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Create jobs and boost R&D\n\nThe VC fund us expected to fund the entire supply chain of the Indian space-sector.\n\nThe fund will help businesses scale, invest in research and development (R&D), and expand their workforce, said the Cabinet in a statement.\n\n\u201cEach investment could generate hundreds of direct jobs in fields like engineering, software development, data analysis, and manufacturing, along with thousands of indirect jobs in supply chains, logistics, and professional services. By fostering a strong startup ecosystem, the fund will not only create jobs but also develop a skilled workforce, driving innovation and enhancing India\u2019s global competitiveness in the space market,\u201d said the Cabinet in a statement."

        "article_content": "Smartphones are constantly getting bigger, and the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL both stretch the boundaries of what\u2019s comfortable to use with one hand. Thankfully, Apple and Google also launched the iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro, which offer the same premium flagship experience in a smaller, more ergonomic form factor.\n\nEach phone boasts reasons to buy it over the other, and many of these have to do with AI. Both phones also cost $1,000, So, which one should you buy? Which phone has the best mix of hardware and software, and utilizes AI in ways that will improve your life? Let\u2019s dive into the details.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: specs\n\nSpecs iPhone 16 Pro Pixel 9 Pro Size 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm (5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches) 152.8 x 72 x 8.5mm (6.02 x 2.83 x 0.32 inches) Weight 199 grams (7.03 ounces) 199 grams (7.02 ounces) Screen 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR OLED 1206 x 2622 pixels ProMotion with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate Dolby Vision, 2,000 nits brightness 460 pixels per inch 6.3-inch OLED 1280 x 2856 pixels 120Hz dynamic refresh rate 3,000 nits peak brightness 495 pixels per inch Operating system iOS 18 Android 14, upgradable to Android 15 RAM and storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 8GB RAM 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 16GB RAM Processor Apple A18 Pro Six-core CPU Six-core GPU Google Tesnor G4 Octa-core CPU Mali-G715 GPU Camera Rear: 48-megapixels primary, f/1.8, 1/1.28\u2033, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 120\u00b0 FOV 12MP telephoto, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Front: 12MP, f/1.9, 1/3.6\u2033 Rear: 50MP primary, f/1.7, 1/1.31\u2033, PDAF, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/1.7, 123\u00b0 FOV 48MP telephoto, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Front: 42MP, f/2.2, PDAF Video Rear: 4K, up to 120 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Rear: 8K, up to 30fps\n\n4K, up to 60 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, tri-band Bluetooth 5.3 Wi-Fi 7, tri-band Bluetooth 5.3 Ports USB-C Gen 3.2 DisplayPort USB-C Gen 3.2 Water resistance IP68 (maximum depth of 6m up to 30 minutes) IP68 (maximum depth of 1.5m up to 30 minutes) Battery & charging 3,582 mAh 30W fast charging 25W wireless charging via MagSafe 15W Qi2 wireless charging 4,700 mAh 27W fast charging 21W wireless charging with Pixel Stand 12W Qi wireless charging Colors Black Titanium,\n\nWhite Titanium,\n\nNatural Titanium,\n\nDesert Titanium Porcelain,\n\nRose Quartz,\n\nHazel,\n\nObsidian Price Starts at $999 Starts at $999\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: design and display\n\nBoth phones have undergone subtle changes from their predecessors, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pixel 8 Pro. Unlike previous years, both now feature near-identical specs sheets to their bigger siblings, and they both offer the same flagship experience in a smaller, more ergonomic size.\n\nThe big difference is in style: Apple uses titanium in the build of the iPhone 16 Pro, which feels lighter and more premium than the Pixel 9 Pro, which uses aluminum, but comes in more vibrant colors. Even though they weigh the same 199 grams, the iPhone 16 Pro feels slightly lighter than the Pixel 9 Pro thanks to the titanium build.\n\nThe choice of titanium also means the iPhone 16 Pro features more muted colors than the Pixel 9 Pro. The four titanium color choices are beautiful, but none are quite as vibrant as the Rose Quartz Pixel 9 Pro. The pink color choice means your Pixel 9 Pro can stand out, although there are more traditional color choices available if Pink isn\u2019t your preference.\n\nMeasuring 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm, the iPhone 16 Pro is 3mm shorter, 0.5mm narrower, and 0.25mm thinner than the Pixel 9 Pro, but they feel virtually identical in the hand. The iPhone 16 Pro also has a Camera Control button on the right side,and the Action button on the left, while the Pixel 9 Pro has a mmWave antenna cutout on the top, even in countries where mmWave isn\u2019t available.\n\nBoth phones have a 6.3-inch OLED display, with a dynamic refresh rate of up to 120Hz. The Pixel 9 Pro display is slightly higher resolution, resulting in a higher pixel density (495 pixels per inch versus 460 ppi), but the difference is minimal. The Pixel 9 Pro has a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, while the iPhone 16 Pro doesn\u2019t get as dark at 2,000 nits. However, there\u2019s functionally little difference in the quality or brightness of the displays during day-to-day use.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro has a slightly better display, but there\u2019s no denying how good the titanium build on the iPhone 16 Pro feels in the hand. This one\u2019s a stalemate.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: performance and battery\n\nRecent Pixel devices have been plagued by problems with Google\u2019s Tensor GPU, and while Google has stuck with its chipset, the Tensor G4 chip in the Pixel 9 Pro is vastly improved. It\u2019s designed with performance and AI in mind and fixes many of the problems in the previous generation, including poor battery life and overheating. It\u2019s paired with a whopping 16GB of RAM inside the Pixel 9 Pro, which results in fast performance that left us impressed.\n\nIn comparison, the iPhone 16 Pro is powered by the new Apple A18 Pro chipset that\u2019s designed with performance, battery life, and yes, AI, in mind. Compared to the A17 Pro chipset, it offers up to 15% faster CPU performance, 20% faster graphics performance, and 2x faster ray tracing. The neural processing unit (NPU) performance is very similar, but the improved heat dissipation on the iPhone 16 Pro means it\u2019ll be harder to overheat your iPhone.\n\nThat\u2019s what all the numbers say, but as we discovered in our iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro reviews, both phones offer excellent performance in most conditions. The A18 Pro chipset inside the iPhone 16 Pro is faster than the Tensor G4 and more likely to handle future use cases, but neither phone disappoints in the experience offered today.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro features a battery capacity of around 3,582mAh while the Pixel 9 Pro has a much larger 4,700mAh capacity. However, the tight integration of hardware and software means the iPhone 16 Pro can have a smaller technical capacity and deliver slightly better battery life than the Pixel 9 Pro. In our testing, Apple\u2019s flagship lasts up to two hours longer, but both phones offer all-day battery life with some juice to spare.\n\nBoth phones offer \u201cfast\u201d charging that is among the slowest in the industry, and both phone makers have opted to use their own standard for faster wireless charging. The iPhone 16 Pro uses MagSafe for 25-watt wireless charging, while the Pixel 9 Pro requires the Pixel Stand to achieve 21W. However, both also support the Qi standard, with the iPhone 16 Pro offering up to 15W speeds when charging with Qi2 and the Pixel 9 Pro being capable of 12W charging when connected to a Qi charger.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is very similar to the Pixel 9 Pro, but offers slightly better battery life and overall performance. The Tensor G4 is no slouch \u2014 and vastly improved over previous years \u2014 but Apple still holds the lead.\n\nWinner: Apple iPhone 16 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: cameras\n\nBoth phones use a triple-camera setup and advanced algorithms to capture photos at a variety of focal lengths. The Pixel 9 Pro has better hardware on paper, but each phone has its pros and cons. Google has a slight advantage in still photography and software features, but the iPhone 16 Pro is better for creators and anyone focused on video.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro has a 50-megapixel main camera, a 48MP ultrawide camera, and a 48MP periscope telephoto camera that offers up to 5x zoom. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 Pro uses a 48MP main camera (with the Fusion branding) that captures high-resolution 24MP photos by default. There\u2019s also a 48MP ultrawide camera with a smaller f/2.2 aperture and a 12MP periscope telephoto camera that also offers up to 5x zoom.\n\nThere are many hardware similarities between these two cameras, but it\u2019s in the wider feature set where they diverge. The Pixel 9 Pro comes with features like Add Me \u2014 which makes it easy to include everyone in a group shot, even the photographer \u2014 Auto Frame in the Magic Editor, Zoom Enhance to capture more detail at higher zoom lengths, and Reimagine to help you reimagine photos using generative AI.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro also comes with a slate of camera features, although they\u2019re more geared toward creators. The Camera Control button makes it easy to launch the camera, swipe through different functions, and zoom in or out of a photo or video. The camera control button will also enable Vision Intelligence features later this year, offering a similar experience to Google Lens, where you can point the camera at something and learn more about it straightaway.\n\nThe upgrade of the ultrawide camera to 48MP offers far more detail and better color reproduction. The revamped Photography Styles allow you to tweak and refine your photos before you take them. There\u2019s also the ability to take 4K video portraits at 120 frames per second (fps), Dolby Vision recording, and improvements to audio recording. Audio Mix allows you to choose from four different styles and edit the audio in a video to match this professional style.\n\nBoth phones take fantastic photos, and personal preference will play into this. The iPhone 16 Pro ekes out a win, however, thanks to better photographic styles and video recording.\n\nWinner: Apple iPhone 16 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: software and updates\n\nBoth companies have made strong promises about software and updates, with Google promising seven years of security and software updates for the Pixel 9 Pro. At the same time, Apple makes no guarantees, but its phones have usually been supported for just as long, if not longer.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro launched on Android 14, but can be updated to Android 15 after the recent launch. The update for the Pixel 9 Pro brings a host of new features, including the ability to hide sensitive apps and improvements in theft protection, the ability to generate passkeys, and App Pairing. This last feature allows you to save combinations of two apps and launch them with a single tap.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro, meanwhile, ushers in iOS 18, which introduces one of the biggest overhauls to the iPhone experience. If you\u2019re an Android user, many of the new features in iOS 18 will feel familiar, because it\u2019s the closest that the iPhone has ever come to replicating the Android experience.\n\nSome of the biggest iOS 18 features include a customizable home screen \u2014 you can finally move apps wherever you want \u2014 a customizable control center, a new private folder for your apps, and the ability to lock apps behind a paywall. There are also huge overhauls of Apple Photos, new features in iMessage, support for the RCS standard for messaging, a new Passwords manager, and much more. It\u2019s a huge overhaul of the iPhone experience.\n\nBoth companies are also betting big on AI. Google dedicated much of its Pixel event to showcasing the power of Gemini as your voice assistant. There are new tools for creating and editing images, custom weather reports, a new screenshots app, and many more features that leverage Generative AI to usher in a host of new features.\n\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 16 Pro also bets big on AI, but takes a different approach. Apple Intelligence powers the revamped Siri, but it isn\u2019t launching until later this month. The full rollout of the new Apple Intelligence features won\u2019t be available until early next year, and while features like Apple Intelligence Summaries are some of the best use cases for AI, it\u2019ll take six months from launch for the iPhone 16 Pro to get the full suite of AI features.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel 9 Pro comes with one year of Gemini Advanced for free (after which, it\u2019s $20 per month), while the Apple Intelligence features on the iPhone 16 Pro are entirely free \u2014 except for the ChatGPT integration, which uses your existing subscription \u2014 although Apple may choose to charge for some features in the future.\n\nBoth phones focus on AI, and while Apple Intelligence has a lot of promise, the delay in launch means the Pixel 9 Pro offers better overall software and AI features right now.\n\nWinner: Pixel 9 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: price and availability\n\nBoth phones cost $999 for 128GB of storage, and each charges a $100 premium for the 256GB version. The Pixel 9 Pro costs $1,219 for the 512GB and $1,449 for the 1TB models, while the iPhone 16 Pro costs $1,299 and $1,499, respectively.\n\nThings get a little confusing when you consider the Pixel 9 Pro colors, however. The Porcelain and Hazel colors only come with up to 512GB of storage, while the Rose Quartz model is bizarrely only available with 256GB of storage. If you want the top storage, you have to go for the Obsidian (aka Black) color.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is far simpler. The four titanium color choices \u2014 Natural Titanium, White Titanium, Black Titanium, and the hero, Desert Titanium \u2014 are available in all storage options.\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: verdict\n\nTwo similar phones, from two companies that you\u2019ve heard of. This sums up this comparison, at least on paper. Once you dive in, you realize that the differences are subtle, but they do exist.\n\nBoth phones weigh the same, but the iPhone 16 Pro feels lighter. The cameras are very similar, and each camera excels in different ways. Even the software is fairly similar, with iOS 18 taking great strides to offer Android-esque levels of customization.\n\nWhich smartphone is best depends on which platform you prefer. If you prefer iOS, then buy the iPhone 16 Pro. For Android lovers, the Pixel 9 Pro is a fantastic smartphone. If you want to make the switch in either direction, there\u2019s no better time, but if you\u2019re thinking of switching to Android, it\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel 9 Pro is a great alternative, but the OnePlus 12 is the best Android alternative to the iPhone."
