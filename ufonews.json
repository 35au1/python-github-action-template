        "article_content": "Many of the reported cases of alleged alien encounters, flying saucers, or abductions take place in remote locations, far from the eyes and cameras of almost anyone, or in conditions that make it difficult to see anything clearly. For those who fabricate such experiences, it is a necessary alibi. The case of New Yorker Linda Napolitano, a housewife of Italian descent who said she was abducted by aliens in 1989, generated huge media coverage for exactly the opposite reason: she claimed that a UFO had taken her from her bedroom by means of a tractor beam in the early hours of the morning, in the middle of Manhattan.\n\nTogether with researcher Budd Hopkins, one of the most famous figures in ufology, she brought 23 witnesses to the table who supported her story and said they had seen her fly over the Brooklyn Bridge. The family not only confirmed the veracity of her experiences, but also declared themselves victims of interventions from outer space. And they all stand firm, to the point that Napolitano, who is now 77 years old, has just sued Netflix over a documentary that casts serious doubts on what some media dubbed \u201cthe abduction of the century.\u201d\n\nThe three-episode series, The Manhattan Alien Abduction, was written by Linda Napolitano herself and premiered in the U.S. on October 30, just in time for Halloween. It certainly has terrifying elements, not so much in the dramatizations of the abduction itself, but testimonies such as that of her son, who appears with his face obscured and claims to have been in psychological treatment for years over the trauma of alien visits of which he, who experienced the coverage of the case as a child, is entirely convinced. However, there is another woman who manages to displace Napolitano from the center of the documentary: Carol Rainey, Hopkins\u2019 ex-wife and a notable skeptic of her former husband\u2019s work, especially on the Manhattan case. The basis of the complaint against Netflix is that the participation of Rainey, who died in 2023, is much greater than the aggrieved party expected. Napolitano says she was assured Rainey would make only one appearance, but she is, by all accounts, the co-star.\n\nThe apartment block in Manhattan where Linda Napolitano was allegedly abducted by aliens in 1989. General (\u00a92005 Credit:TopFoto/Fortean)\n\nAs such, The Manhattan Alien Abduction is much more interesting than a mere reconstruction of a 35-year-old UFO file. Its unexpected focus on Rainey allows us to access another story, that of someone who, out of respect for the man she had once loved, for the credibility and objectivity she once had, made the tough decision to disavow him in a shattering publication that questioned his rigor and methodology. \u201cI saw that I was losing objectivity. I loved Budd. He seemed to me to have complete integrity. Completely honest. But if it was a hoax, I needed to know if my husband was complicit,\u201d Rainey states in the documentary. Peter Robbins, Hopkins\u2019 assistant and friend, who blames Rainey for Hopkins\u2019 book Witnessed: The True Story Of The Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions (1996) not being republished or made into a film adaptation, doesn\u2019t see it that way: \u201cHer goal in life was to destroy this man and destroy his reputation.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a harpy,\u201d Napolitano goes so far as to say on camera.\n\nThe housewife\u2019s story contained bizarre elements that went beyond the 1989 abduction. A year later, Napolitano alerted Hopkins that she was being harassed by two men named Dan and Richard, who had witnessed the event from an official car in which they were transporting none other than then-Secretary General of the United Nations Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar. Hopkins, who never saw them himself, gave credence to the letters she received signed in their name and that of the diplomat. According to Napolitano, the men kidnapped her and Dan, who was madly in love with her, ended up in a psychiatric hospital. She also underwent an X-ray test to prove that a lump in her nose was the result of an alien graft. The X-ray revealed that it did appear to house a small cylindrical object, but when she later agreed to undergo surgery to remove it, the object never appeared.\n\nI want to believe\n\nSociologist, writer and editor Pablo Vergel, a contributor to Spanish TV show Cuarto Milenio, which covers mysteries and enigmas, spoke to Napolitano several years ago via Facebook. His intention was to have her participate in a report on the show, although he was unable to get her to appear in front of the cameras. Vergel acknowledges to EL PA\u00cdS that it is \u201ca very problematic case,\u201d which owes its popularity to the context and \u201cthe series of incredible twists and turns that followed, a real soap opera, thanks to which it had a lot of coverage in the tabloid press [...] Iconically, this UFO that lifts someone from their apartment with a ray, takes them out and crosses the most famous skyline in the world, over the Brooklyn Bridge, cannot be more powerful,\u201d he says. In 2021, Vergel published in Spain a book by Budd Hopkins, Intruders, originally from 1987 and one of the key titles in the abduction phenomenon in the United States.\n\nWhitley Strieber photographed in 2016. David Livingston (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cBudd Hopkins is part of the triad of researchers who created the great wave of abductions in the United States, almost a sociological phenomenon, along with Whitley Strieber and John E. Mack,\u201d explains the editor. \u201cHe did have a certain courage; he created support groups for people who said they had been abducted, he established mechanisms and protocols\u2026 Whitley Strieber, the famous author of Communion (1987), turned to Budd Hopkins and said in his book that he helped him a lot in managing his emotional crisis after the traumatic experience he had [his alleged encounter with extraterrestrials]. But at a certain point he began to act like a devotee, like an absolute believer who could not conceive of any alternative explanation. Many people have accused him of having been an evangelist of the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial hypothesis, rather than of investigating it. He abused hypnosis a lot. If you read his books, hypnosis does not follow methodological controls, it leaves suggestion very open. There is even the possibility of ending up implanting memories in the person. Budd Hopkins \u2014 and I say this as his editor \u2014 seems to me to be an interesting author, but also very questionable.\u201d\n\nThe sociologist refers to a study of the Napolitano case published in 1993 by parapsychologist George P. Hansen, together with Joseph J. Stefula and Richard D. Butler, who was critical of Hopkins for not verifying the \u201cvery close\u201d relationship between the housewife and the professional who performed the X-ray test, or the independence of the supposed 23 witnesses to the phenomenon. Among the testimonies that Hopkins had accepted as valid was that of a woman who said she had not been able to see clearly because of the fog \u2014 on a morning when such weather conditions did not occur \u2014 or that of another who, excusing herself on the grounds of her fear, did not close the curtains at her window that night. Hansen and his colleagues found as many as 16 parallels between Napolitano\u2019s story and Garfield Reeves-Stevens\u2019 1989 science fiction novel Nighteyes. They also questioned Hopkins\u2019 honesty, noting that the alleged abductee said he had promised her half the profits from his book about her case.\n\nRobbins, the colleague who backs Hopkins in The Manhattan Alien Abduction, brings up in his statements that Rainey, the researcher\u2019s ex-wife, grew up in a fundamentalist Christian family belonging to the Plymouth Brethren, to suggest that she opposed the extraterrestrial hypothesis because of her religion. Rainey argues in the documentary that, precisely, her experience with Hopkins reopened a wound from the past, when she was estranged from her entire family for questioning the faith: \u201cHis dogma was as radical as my father\u2019s. They both never doubted and seemed to be in possession of the truth. I could not tolerate what he was doing to very vulnerable people,\u201d Rainey said in reference to Hopkins\u2019 hypnosis sessions with people convinced they were being visited by extraterrestrials.\n\nNapolitano, who is said in the series to have had a frustrated vocation as a music star, has called the late Rainey \u201cresentful and alcoholic\u201d in her lawsuit, as well as damaging to her reputation. Nevertheless, The Manhattan Alien Abduction is conciliatory to anyone who really wants to believe her story. Through the theme of faith, the documentary does allow us to glimpse that, among the scholars or mere lovers of the UFO phenomenon, there are those who, with more or less rigor, try to collate their research, and those who only seek to confirm their own beliefs.\n\nDepending on your preferences, the Brooklyn Bridge story generated a previous documentary that completely takes the authenticity of the matter for granted: Linda Napolitano: The Alien Abduction of the Century (2022). Although Napolitano does not participate in it, we are told, based on the thesis of a certain Corrado Malanga, an Italian researcher of the holographic universe, that humans are the most spiritually developed creatures in the universe and that aliens abduct us to imprint their memories in our unconscious, in order to become immortal with our soul.

        "article_content": "Those curious of life outside our world can find fun Saturday at the Carbondalien Festival, which celebrates the milestone of a mysterious event in Carbondale\u2019s history.\n\nThe Carbondalien Festival marks the 50th anniversary of the infamous incident near Russell Park in Carbondale that many believe was a UFO crash landing on Nov. 9, 1974. The festival will be held Saturday at the park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nThe event is hosted by the Carbondale Arts Alliance and will have vendors, food trucks, speakers, art and live music.\n\nNicole Curtis, the Carbondalien Festival\u2019s organizer, \u201cCarbondalien-in-Chief\u201d and co-owner of the City Line Shop Cafe in Carbondale, was inspired to start the festival as an alien art walk after seeing how art helped save other nearby small towns.\n\nMany townspeople are not aware of the UFO event since many did not want to discuss it for fear of being ridiculed. There were many sightings of the UFO that allegedly crashed from around the county, from the Scranton area to Carbondale, according to Curtis.\n\nWhat occurred 50 years ago is an \u201camazing incredible thing that not many people know about that should be celebrated and not be ashamed about,\u201d said Curtis. On that day, \u201csomething glowed in the water for nine hours and left on a flatbed truck,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the newspaper archives, the legend began on Nov. 9, 1974, when three teenage boys alerted police after witnessing a \u201cred, whirring ball\u201d fall from the sky and into a mine pond. The incident drew police, military and the curious to the city and concluded with a dive team pulling a battery-powered mine lantern from the pond.\n\nCurtis started planning for the Carbondalien Festival a year ago by looking for an artist to design an alien and reached out to Jennifer Forgione, known as JFo, studio artist of JFo Generation in Spring Brook Twp.\n\nForgione\u2019s mother was an eyewitness to the UFO while observing the sky at her home in Dunmore. This synchronistic event is \u201cwhy I am so passionate about it and it is a very good thing,\u201d said Forgione, who is excited to participate in the festival linked to her mother\u2019s UFO sighting.\n\nThose wanting to know about the legend can watch the theatrical performance, \u201cThe Russel Park Experience,\u201d presented in partnership with the Lackawanna Historical Society. The performance immerses the audience as a member of the press at the crash site trying to get the facts of what happened. Performances will take place at Russell Park at 11:45 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m.\n\nThe festival is a \u201cgreat opportunity to meet interesting people and learn new things,\u201d as well as a place to meet \u201clike-minded people in the cryptid and UFO world,\u201d said Curtis.\n\nFestivalgoers can learn more about UFO topics at the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite. Speakers include: James Krug with \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers & How to Become a MUFON Investigator,\u201d Bill Weber with \u201cUFO Sightings and Cover Ups,\u201d Tim Renner with \u201cThe 1920\u2019s Bigfoot Flap in Pennsylvania\u201d and Alan B. Smith with \u201cExposing UFO Debunkers.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Carbondalien Festival will have a ticketed after-party event at the ballroom of the Hotel Anthracite with a cocktail hour, dinner and presentation of \u201cWorld of the Weird\u201d by Heather Taddy, known as the team documentarian on A&E\u2019s hit television series \u201cParanormal State,\u201d from 6 to 8:30 p.m.\n\nThroughout the city, 34 local businesses are hosting a scavenger hunt with 7-foot-tall wooden aliens unique to each location. Visitors can vote for their favorite design on the festival\u2019s website.\n\nOther activities include a free Alien Swim at the Carbondale YMCA, and an Alien Storytime and Craft, Alien Teen Bingo and Extraterrestrial Film Festival at the Carbondale Public Library.\n\nAccording to Forgione, the more people who get excited about the festival, the less people will be afraid of aliens.\n\n\u201cYou see a cute little heinie on the alien and smile and laugh,\u201d Forgione said of her artwork. Forgione will be selling handmade 7-foot-tall, 4-foot-tall and 2-foot-tall wooden aliens at the event, along with alien ornaments.\n\nCurtis said the event is to keep \u201can openness to what the story could be.\u201d This gives people an opportunity to not argue over the story, but ponder the possibilities.\n\n\u201cMany feel ostracized talking and sharing their story,\u201d said Forgione. \u201cThere might be so many stories that people are afraid to tell.\u201d\n\nAn eyewitness who wishes to remain anonymous and was first on the scene has donated stacks of photos, business cards of reporters who came to town and typed-up reports about the event to the Lackawanna Historical Society, according to Curtis.\n\nCurtis hopes the Carbondalien Festival helps to build tourism for the town by getting people to see what the town has to offer. She wants the Carbondalien Festival to evolve into an annual event.\n\nThose attending the event will find \u201can escape from a regular day and have a magical one-of-a-kind experience,\u201d said Forgione.\n\nFor more information about the Carbondalien Festival and to purchase tickets for the after-party, go to carbondalienfestival.com.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Carbondalien Festival\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: Russell Park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown.\n\nEvents: The immersive \u201cThe Russel Park Experience\u201d at the park, the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite, a citywide scavenger hunt, alien-themed activities at the Carbondale Public Library and more.

To this day, Notepad remains one of the more handy Windows apps thanks to its fast, lightweight, distraction-free approach to text editing.\n\nHowever, even this simple app is getting an AI makeover thanks to new rewrite features debuting in version 11.2410.15.0. Adding to earlier updates that included tabbed documents and auto-saving is an option to rewrite text using generative AI.\n\nThe new Rewrite tool allows users to highlight portions of text within Notepad and ask for them to be rewritten to fit various tones or formats, with the option to expand on certain sections or cut them down in size.\n\nWindows Notepad Rewrite tool in use on Windows 11, offering a generative AI rewrite of a highlighted portion of text.\n\nIt's a blessing for students struggling to crawl past the finish line on those strict word-count essays, and a handy tool for all when it comes to fleshing out the fleeting ideas that Notepad is most often used to capture while at your machine.\n\nOutlook\n\nUpdates to Windows Paint and Notepad are now in the process of rolling out to Windows Insider Program members in the Canary and Dev Channels.\n\nUsers interested in checking out these new features can join the Windows Insider program by heading to the Settings panel in Windows, clicking on \"Windows Update\" in the left pane, and \"Windows Insider Program\" in the right pane, before then clicking the \"Get started\" button and linking their Microsoft account.\n\nAfter reading through the Insider Program agreements, you can then choose which Insider channel you wish to join.\n\nIt's great to see Microsoft continue to use AI to empower its classic range of apps, adding some impressive functionality to the Windows platform out of the box.\n\nTools like Generative fill and erase are impressively useful, which makes their inclusion in bundled software like Paint all the more impressive.\n\nThere's still a long way to go before Microsoft can hope to challenge Adobe on its image editing prowess, but who knows where things will go if Microsoft remains committed to using AI to overhaul its classic software in this way.\n\nMore from Laptop Mag"

        "article_content": "Microsoft\u2019s been pretty crafty with integrating AI in multiple Windows 11 native apps. Paint got an AI overhaul last year when it debuted with \u201cCocreator, an AI-powered image generation feature.\n\nThe company later rebranded the feature to \u201cImage Creator\u201d and reserved the Cocreator feature for Copilot+ PCs. Now, it is testing Generative Erase and Fill features in the Insider channel.\n\nThe names are self-explanatory. Generative Fill uses AI models to add elements to the existing image. So, you can select an image area and enter a simple prompt like \u201cadd a cat,\u201d and it\u2019ll do that for you.\n\nSimilarly, the Generative Erase detects the highlighted area, wipes it, and blends it with the background colors, like there wasn\u2019t anything there.\n\nThere isn\u2019t any submenu for Generative Fill and Erase. These options appear after selecting the image area with the selection tool.\n\nWe installed the latest version of Paint that contains both these features, aka version 11.2410.28.0, but remember the new experience is only for Windows 11 Canary and Dev Insiders. Generative Fill is only available and works on Copilot+ Insider PCs, while the Erase feature works on every machinein the Insider Program.\n\nGenerative Fill and Erase AI features in MS Paint\n\nDue to the lack of a Copilot+ PC, we could only test the Generative Erase feature on our AMD hardware. We were happy with the overall performance as it didn\u2019t struggle much while removing an object from the image.\n\nThe feature works without the internet, so you don\u2019t have to worry about exhausting daily credits like the Image Cocreator feature. Generative Fill must also work on the same idea because Copilot+ PC has local AI models that can create AI images quickly.\n\nNote that the Erase feature isn\u2019t something new. The Photos app has had it for quite some time, and the feature underwent multiple name rebrandings before Microsoft settled on \u201cGenerative Erase.\u201d\n\nWe like this approach as the name is less confusing, and having similar names for identical features is helpful for end users.\n\nHow to use Paint AI\u2019s Generative Fill and Erase features in Windows 11\n\nAs mentioned above, the selection tool is the entry point to invoke both these features. Click on the Selection Tool and choose the \u201cRectangle\u201d or \u201cFree-form\u201d option. Then, drag the cursor to select a portion of the image.\n\nYou\u2019ll see the \u201cFill\u201d and \u201cErase\u201d icons along with the \u201cBackground Remover\u201d icon. Click on the Fill icon and describe the element you want to add to the image. Then, click the Create button to generate the image with locally stored AI models.\n\nIf you\u2019re satisfied, click on the Keep option to finalize the image. Otherwise, click the retry icon to generate the image again and experiment with designs.\n\nNext, we tried the Generative Erase option, which doesn\u2019t need a Copilot+ PC to work. We selected a portion of the image and clicked on the Erase icon. It worked its AI magic and removed the Insider build watermark in the image with the background.\n\nYou can also use it with the Eraser tool. Select the Eraser tool from the menu bar, and you\u2019ll see the same Erase icon on the left side.\n\nDrag the slider to adjust the brush size and then drag it to highlight the area.

        "article_content": "Anthropic has been gaining on arch rival OpenAI in recent months, according to data from a popular developer tool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI SDK is a toolkit that helps developers build AI-powered applications. It provides code libraries that developers install to get their apps to communicate with different AI models. Data is publishes showing how many times these code packages are downloaded each week.\n\nThis is a useful window into how popular the top AI models are with developers, a key constituency of early tech adopters.\n\nThe data shows that OpenAI remains in the lead. However, Anthropic has been growing faster lately in terms of developer mindshare.\n\nIn the week of August 18, the OpenAI code library was downloaded almost 229,000 times by developers. The equivalent Anthropic library was downloaded almost 38,000 times, according to the data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late October, OpenAI downloads had remained relatively unchanged, while Anthropic downloads were much higher: about 244,000 for OpenAI and 100,000 for Anthropic.\n\nData from NPM Trends NPM Trends\n\nThe recent adoption trends can be partly explained by a new AI model that Anthropic released in the summer.\n\n\"Anthropic's recent gains can be attributed to their Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, which, among many tasks, excels at understanding and generating code,\" said Jared Palmer, VP of AI at Vercel, a startup that offers the AI SDK and other developer tools. \"Its combination of speed, cost, and output quality has won over the developer community for the time being.\"\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet came out in June, and it has been particularly useful for tasks that developers need to do regularly, such as understanding and generating software code.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, OpenAI has maintained its lead among developers, according to the data. That's primarily due to its first-mover advantage and other factors such as cheap pricing of its GPT-4o-mini AI model and strong developer tooling and documentation.\n\nThere's also pretty widespread adoption of their API, or application programming interface. This is a common way for different software applications to communicate and share data.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that OpenAI's lead is slightly inflated by the download data. That's because many AI model providers have adopted OpenAI's API specification as a de facto standard. That allows developers to use the same OpenAI code library package but point their apps to different models.\n\nIt's hard to quantify how much this exaggerates OpenAI's lead, but it also supports the general conclusion that Anthropic has been gaining on its main rival in recent months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said usage of the startup's API has doubled since it released its GPT-4o mini AI model in July. OpenAI has also tripled the number of active apps running in production on its platform in the past year.\n\nThe OpenAI spokesperson shared a critique of the NPM data, saying downloads of these code libraries are not technically an accurate representation of developer audience since it doesn't reflect actual usage or spending.\n\nAnthropic had no problem with the data and what it shows. The company said its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model helps developers handle complex software architecture and multi-step processes. It also noted that enterprises are increasingly adopting Claude for business-critical functions where accuracy is key, such as software development and data analysis.\n\n\"Our new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model is the ideal choice for developers to build AI-powered applications with state-of-the-art performance across the board, including coding, complex financial analysis, and live chat support,\" Dianne Penn, product lead at Anthropic, told Business Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenn cited DoorDash, Sourcegraph, and GitLab as companies that are using Claude to reduce development time, increase code acceptance rates, and build AI features."

Apple also sent out corresponding beta releases for iPad, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision and the development environment XCode 16.2 beta 2.\n\nWhat does iOS 18 beta 2 add?\n\nExpanded AI features, including ChatGPT\u2019s integration with Siri, are highlights of the iOS 18.2 beta. The new Apple Intelligence AI features include:\n\nImage Playground and Image Wand bring generative AI picture generation and editing tools.\n\nbring generative AI picture generation and editing tools.

This is intended to make the voice assistant respond to natural language and handle some writing queries.\n\niOS 18 beta 2 also adds:\n\nThe new camera controls focus the image with one press and take the picture with a second. This appealingly evokes an analog camera, but time will tell whether it will feel clunky on the phone.\n\nFind My will now allow users to share the location of a lost item with another person.

Still, it will be interesting to see if Siri loyalty attracts an energetic new audience to the possibility of custom \u2014 or even agentic \u2014 AI voice commands.\n\nHowever, in the release notes for iOS 18.2, Apple notes that requesting ChatGPT to create images in Writing Tools might not work. Users may also need to reboot their device after downloading the beta so that messages can appear in the Messages app.\n\nSEE: The UK offers a free AI self-assessment tool for businesses to help manage the risks of AI.\n\nUpcoming feature may estimate how much time it will take for your phone battery to charge\n\n9to5Mac was the first to report that iOS 18.2 includes a handy feature called Battery Intelligence, which provides a time estimate for how long it will take to charge your phone battery.\n\nI can envision this as a pleasant, small reduction of range anxiety when I\u2019m in an airport for a work trip or out in the city for the day. 9to5Mac searched the beta\u2019s code for the charge time estimate, so don\u2019t expect the feature to be available in the beta or the public release. Furthermore, with \u201cintelligence\u201d in the name, I wonder whether Apple considered attaching AI to this estimate\u2014but that may just be a matter of branding.\n\nGet a first look at the app transaction options now required in the EU\n\nThe iOS 18.2 beta will show Apple\u2019s upcoming changes to comply with the Digital Markets Act in the EU.\n\nThese include options for developers to offer iOS and iPadOS apps on app stores outside of the Apple Store. Developers can create their own app marketplaces, and users can choose which app marketplace and contactless transaction app to set as their default and which to delete. To comply, support for exporting user data in Safari and for web browsers to import user data was also added in iOS 18.2.\n\nApple isn\u2019t happy about the changes, saying the EU directives introduce new possibilities for \u201cmalware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.\u201d The EU says Apple\u2019s \u2018walled garden\u2019 ecosystem prevents competition from other app stores, payment methods, and creators.\n\nHow to download the iOS 18.2 beta\n\nTo participate, sign up for the free Apple Beta Software Program. Apple Intelligence features require iPhone 15 Pro or later to run generative AI on-device."

The study ranked counties and local authorities based on reports of paranormal activity per square mile, creating a \"paranormal activity score\" to determine the most supernaturally dense areas in the UK. This approach highlights where ghostly encounters are most concentrated.\n\nSo which town is officially the most haunted with a Paranormal Activity Score of 100 and 43 reported paranormal activities and haunted locations all concentrated in just 15 square miles? The would be Ipswich. The Ancient House is known for ghostly monk sightings and mysterious footsteps, while Christchurch Mansion is home to the ghost of a young Victorian maid. The Ipswich Museum, with reported sightings of a phantom Edwardian lady, offers a cultural twist to ghostly encounters.\n\nAlex Wilson, CEO and founder of Affordable Urns, said: \"Our research reveals some exciting destinations for paranormal enthusiasts. The high concentration of reported hauntings in these areas speaks to the rich history and enduring legends of the UK. While we encourage people to explore these fascinating locations, we also urge visitors to approach them with respect and caution.

The festival will be held Saturday at the park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nThe event is hosted by the Carbondale Arts Alliance and will have vendors, food trucks, speakers, art and live music.\n\nNicole Curtis, the Carbondalien Festival\u2019s organizer, \u201cCarbondalien-in-Chief\u201d and co-owner of the City Line Shop Cafe in Carbondale, was inspired to start the festival as an alien art walk after seeing how art helped save other nearby small towns.\n\nMany townspeople are not aware of the UFO event since many did not want to discuss it for fear of being ridiculed. There were many sightings of the UFO that allegedly crashed from around the county, from the Scranton area to Carbondale, according to Curtis.\n\nWhat occurred 50 years ago is an \u201camazing incredible thing that not many people know about that should be celebrated and not be ashamed about,\u201d said Curtis. On that day, \u201csomething glowed in the water for nine hours and left on a flatbed truck,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the newspaper archives, the legend began on Nov. 9, 1974, when three teenage boys alerted police after witnessing a \u201cred, whirring ball\u201d fall from the sky and into a mine pond. The incident drew police, military and the curious to the city and concluded with a dive team pulling a battery-powered mine lantern from the pond.\n\nCurtis started planning for the Carbondalien Festival a year ago by looking for an artist to design an alien and reached out to Jennifer Forgione, known as JFo, studio artist of JFo Generation in Spring Brook Twp.\n\nForgione\u2019s mother was an eyewitness to the UFO while observing the sky at her home in Dunmore. This synchronistic event is \u201cwhy I am so passionate about it and it is a very good thing,\u201d said Forgione, who is excited to participate in the festival linked to her mother\u2019s UFO sighting.\n\nThose wanting to know about the legend can watch the theatrical performance, \u201cThe Russel Park Experience,\u201d presented in partnership with the Lackawanna Historical Society. The performance immerses the audience as a member of the press at the crash site trying to get the facts of what happened. Performances will take place at Russell Park at 11:45 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m.\n\nThe festival is a \u201cgreat opportunity to meet interesting people and learn new things,\u201d as well as a place to meet \u201clike-minded people in the cryptid and UFO world,\u201d said Curtis.\n\nFestivalgoers can learn more about UFO topics at the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite. Speakers include: James Krug with \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers & How to Become a MUFON Investigator,\u201d Bill Weber with \u201cUFO Sightings and Cover Ups,\u201d Tim Renner with \u201cThe 1920\u2019s Bigfoot Flap in Pennsylvania\u201d and Alan B. Smith with \u201cExposing UFO Debunkers.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Carbondalien Festival will have a ticketed after-party event at the ballroom of the Hotel Anthracite with a cocktail hour, dinner and presentation of \u201cWorld of the Weird\u201d by Heather Taddy, known as the team documentarian on A&E\u2019s hit television series \u201cParanormal State,\u201d from 6 to 8:30 p.m.\n\nThroughout the city, 34 local businesses are hosting a scavenger hunt with 7-foot-tall wooden aliens unique to each location. Visitors can vote for their favorite design on the festival\u2019s website.\n\nOther activities include a free Alien Swim at the Carbondale YMCA, and an Alien Storytime and Craft, Alien Teen Bingo and Extraterrestrial Film Festival at the Carbondale Public Library.\n\nAccording to Forgione, the more people who get excited about the festival, the less people will be afraid of aliens.\n\n\u201cYou see a cute little heinie on the alien and smile and laugh,\u201d Forgione said of her artwork. Forgione will be selling handmade 7-foot-tall, 4-foot-tall and 2-foot-tall wooden aliens at the event, along with alien ornaments.\n\nCurtis said the event is to keep \u201can openness to what the story could be.\u201d This gives people an opportunity to not argue over the story, but ponder the possibilities.\n\n\u201cMany feel ostracized talking and sharing their story,\u201d said Forgione. \u201cThere might be so many stories that people are afraid to tell.\u201d\n\nAn eyewitness who wishes to remain anonymous and was first on the scene has donated stacks of photos, business cards of reporters who came to town and typed-up reports about the event to the Lackawanna Historical Society, according to Curtis.\n\nCurtis hopes the Carbondalien Festival helps to build tourism for the town by getting people to see what the town has to offer. She wants the Carbondalien Festival to evolve into an annual event.\n\nThose attending the event will find \u201can escape from a regular day and have a magical one-of-a-kind experience,\u201d said Forgione.\n\nFor more information about the Carbondalien Festival and to purchase tickets for the after-party, go to carbondalienfestival.com.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Carbondalien Festival\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: Russell Park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown.\n\nEvents: The immersive \u201cThe Russel Park Experience\u201d at the park, the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite, a citywide scavenger hunt, alien-themed activities at the Carbondale Public Library and more.

Despite the Bengals struggles early in the year, I like them to keep things close and potentially win tonight.\n\nBut remember, the FanDuel promo code only rewards your $150 bonus bet if your first wager wins. So play things safe and take Cincinnati Bengals +14.5 alternate spread (-430) to ensure you capitalize on the offer."

        "article_content": "Utah quarterback Brandon Rose looks to pass against Houston Saturday, Oct. 26, 2024, in Houston. Rose took over for an ineffective Isaac Wilson during the Utes' loss to the Cougars and could be called on to play when Utah hosts BYU Saturday at Rice-Eccles Stadium.\n\nIn the current age of college football, Utah quarterback Brandon Rose is somewhat of an anomaly.\n\nThe three-star signal-caller, who had offers from Arizona State, Boise State, Northwestern, Colorado and Kansas before committing to Utah, arrived on campus in 2022.\n\nUntil two Saturdays ago, he had never seen the field, aside from three snaps in garbage time in this year\u2019s season-opening win over Southern Utah.\n\nSpecial Collector's Issue: \"1984: The Year BYU was Second to None\" Get an inclusive look inside BYU Football's 1984 National Championship season. Buy Now\n\nRose\u2019s arrival in Salt Lake City coincided with the second of back-to-back Pac-12 titles for the Utes, led by starting quarterback Cam Rising. With Rising entrenched as the starter in 2022, Rose redshirted, with Bryson Barnes winning the QB2 job that year.\n\nLast year, the competition to be Rising\u2019s backup was intriguing, with the more-experienced Barnes battling it out with relative newcomers Nate Johnson and Rose. By the end of spring, it was Rose who had emerged in pole position to be Rising\u2019s backup, which eventually turned into the starting job after Rising missed the entire 2023 season.\n\nBut Rose suffered an injury during fall camp, which kept him out for the better part of two months. By the time he was healthy, Barnes had a solid grip on the starting job, and the time missed was deemed by Utah coach Kyle Whittingham as too much of a setback to overcome.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done well and he was really doing well last year in addition, but had that injury that knocked him out for six or eight weeks, which really set him back and then didn\u2019t get much of anything going last year because of that,\u201d Whittingham said.\n\nThough Utah\u2019s coach said Rose \u201ctook a step forward in just about everything\u201d this spring, he was beat out by true freshman Isaac Wilson in fall camp for the QB2 job, which again essentially turned into the QB1 job after Rising\u2019s season-ending injury.\n\n\u201cSpring ball, had some reps, Isaac got a bunch of the reps as well, but Brandon has made steady and continual progress since he\u2019s been in the program,\u201d Whittingham said.\n\nOnce again, Rose had to start the season watching from the bench.\n\nBut in the third quarter of Utah\u2019s 17-14 loss to Houston, his number was called.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair to pin the entirety of Utah\u2019s offensive struggles on Wilson \u2014 everyone\u2019s had a hand in it \u2014 play-calling, offensive line, wide receivers, tight ends and running backs \u2014 but after another less-than-inspiring performance from the true freshman, coaches had seen enough, and inserted Rose, trying to spark the offense.\n\n\u201cTrying to get a spark, trying to create something,\u201d Whittingham said of the quarterback change. \u201cWe\u2019d only scored one touchdown and just didn\u2019t seem to be gaining any momentum offensively, so we figured it was time to give Brandon an opportunity.\u201d\n\nJust like Wilson, who has played injured since the Arizona game, hasn\u2019t been put in a great situation, it was a tough spot for Rose in his first action \u2014 a tie game on the road without a ton of first-team snaps.\n\nIn his quarter-and-a-half of play, Rose looked slightly more comfortable than Wilson but couldn\u2019t do much to turn around Utah\u2019s offensive fate. He completed 7 of 15 passes \u2014 a couple were dropped by receivers \u2014 for 45 yards and threw an interception on the Utes\u2019 final drive of the game.\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t the result Rose, or the Utes, wanted, for the sophomore from Temecula, California, finally getting the chance to play was a dream come true.\n\n\u201cI mean, everybody dreams of that moment when they\u2019re a kid, wanting to play big Division I football, so it was a dream come true, but we fell short. We got a loss, but shake it off and we\u2019re on to the next.\u201d \u2014 Utah QB Brandon Rose\n\n\u201cI mean, everybody dreams of that moment when they\u2019re a kid, wanting to play big Division I football, so it was a dream come true, but we fell short. We got a loss, but shake it off and we\u2019re on to the next,\u201d Rose said.\n\nIn his third year in the program, after remaining loyal to Utah and sticking it out even as others got opportunities over him, it seems like Rose may get his shot to start in the Utes\u2019 most important game on the schedule.\n\nAbout all that\u2019s left this season for Utah is to play spoiler against its rival \u2014 BYU enters the renewal of the rivalry with an undefeated record and No. 9 ranking \u2014 and try to win two games to become bowl eligible.\n\nThe book has been out on Wilson, but there\u2019s not a ton of game film out on Rose, something that could work in Utah\u2019s favor against BYU. Still, the Cougars won\u2019t be caught off guard no matter which quarterback runs out there and are preparing for both.\n\n\u201cWe have to take a look at all the quarterbacks on their roster and be ready for them,\u201d BYU coach Kalani Sitake said. \u201cI think Jay (Hill) has a good start on that. I don\u2019t think you can give Utah (coaches) a hard time about it. We have been there before, trying to figure out who will be the best guy to earn the spot. We have to prepare for all those guys.\u201d\n\nAt 6-foot-2 and 212 pounds, Rose is bigger than Wilson and has a strong arm. He might not be as mobile as the former Corner Canyon High star, but is still a bit of a threat in the run game.\n\nIf the plan is indeed to start Rose, then he\u2019ll have had a full week of first-team reps and a week for offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian \u2014 who will have had two weeks to put more of his spin on Utah\u2019s offense \u2014 to game plan around him.\n\nEven with the relative unknown of Rose in game situations, with Wilson dinged up and unable to get the offense to that next level, could he provide a better chance for the Utes to beat their rival?\n\nUtes on the air Utah (4-4, 1-4) vs. BYU (8-0, 5-0) Saturday, 8:15 p.m. MST\n\nRice-Eccles Stadium\n\nTV: ESPN\n\nESPN Radio: 700 AM/92.1 FM\n\n\n\nWe may soon find out.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a production-based business, right?\u201d Rose said. \u201cSo if you produce, you\u2019re producing and putting up numbers and everything, offense is rolling, offense is scoring, you\u2019re likely to see that (QB) position stay.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Whittingham says Rose has played his \u201cbest football as a Ute\u201d lately in practice. Whether that translates in the game Saturday, if Rose starts, remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a big body of work to gauge it off in a game situation, but he\u2019s done a nice job in practice and continues to get better and that\u2019s why you coach \u2018em is to hopefully make \u2018em better,\u201d Whittingham said."

        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump now has a 75-day transition period to build out his team before Inauguration Day arrives on Jan. 20. Read more\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump\u2018s impending return to the White House means he\u2019ll want to stand up an entirely new administration from the one that served under President Joe Biden. His team is also pledging that the second won\u2019t look much like the first one Trump established after his 2016 victory.\n\nThe president-elect now has a 75-day transition period to build out his team before Inauguration Day arrives on Jan. 20. One top item on the to-do list: filling around 4,000 government positions with political appointees, people who are specifically tapped for their jobs by Trump\u2019s team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: The latest news and updates following Election Day\n\nThat includes everyone from the secretary of state and other heads of cabinet departments to those selected to serve part time on boards and commissions. Around 1,200 of those presidential appointments require Senate confirmation, which should be easier with the Senate now shifting to Republican control.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump announced his first significant appointment. He named Susie Wiles, the de facto manager of his victorious campaign, as his White House chief of staff, the first woman to hold the influential role.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect:\n\nWhat will the transition look like?\n\nThough the turnover in the new administration will be total, Trump will be familiar with what he needs to accomplish. He built an entirely new administration for his first term and has definite ideas on what to do differently this time.\n\nHe\u2019s already floated some names.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: To win Pennsylvania, Donald Trump did exactly what he needed to in Philly: Improved slightly\n\nTrump said at his victory party early Wednesday that former presidential hopeful and anti-vaccination activist Robert Kennedy Jr. will be tapped to \u201chelp make America healthy again,\u201d adding that \u201cwe\u2019re going to let him go to it.\u201d Ahead of the election, Trump didn\u2019t reject Kennedy\u2019s calls to end fluoridated water. Trump has also pledged to make South African-born Elon Musk, a vocal supporter of the Trump campaign, a secretary of federal \u201ccost-cutting,\u201d and the Tesla CEO has suggested he can find trillions of dollars in government spending to wipe out.\n\nThe transition is not just about filling jobs. Most presidents-elect also receive daily or near-daily intelligence briefings during the transition.\n\nIn 2008, outgoing President George W. Bush personally briefed President-elect Barack Obama on U.S. covert operations. When Trump was preparing to take office in 2016, Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice, briefed Michael Flynn, her designated successor in the new administration. In 2020, Trump\u2019s legal challenges of the election\u2019s results delayed the start of the transition process for weeks, though, and presidential briefings with Biden didn\u2019t begin until Nov. 30.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump won Pa. with more votes than any statewide Republican candidate in history. Here\u2019s how he did it.\n\nWho is helping Trump through the process?\n\nTrump\u2019s transition is being led primarily by friends and family, including Kennedy Jr. and former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, as well as the president-elect\u2019s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and his running mate, JD Vance. Transition co-chairs are Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, Haverford College\u2019s largest donor, and Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who previously led the Small Business Administration during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nLutnick said this year\u2019s operation is \u201cabout as different as possible\u201d from the 2016 effort, which was first led by Chris Christie. After he won eight years ago, Trump fired Christie, tossed out plans the former New Jersey governor had made and gave the job of running the transition to then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Pa. Democrats on what went wrong against Donald Trump and what\u2019s next\n\nAt the start of his first term, Trump assembled an original cabinet that featured some more mainstream Republicans and business leaders who ultimately disappointed, or broke publicly with him, or both. This time, Trump has promised to value loyalty as much as possible \u2014 a philosophy that may ensure he makes picks that are more closely aligned to his ideological beliefs and bombastic professional style.\n\nUnlike the campaign of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump\u2019s team didn\u2019t sign any pre-Election Day transition agreements with the General Services Administration, which essentially acts as the federal government\u2019s landlord. He has therefore already missed deadlines to agree with GSA on logistical matters like office space and tech support and with the White House on access to agencies, including documents, employees, and facilities.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Disappointed voters and organizers in Philadelphia say gender and racial biases contributed to Harris\u2019 loss\n\nNew transition rules\n\nIn 2020, Trump argued that widespread voter fraud \u2014 which hadn\u2019t actually occurred \u2014 cost him the election, delaying the start of the transition from his outgoing administration to Biden\u2019s incoming one for weeks.\n\nFour years ago, the Trump-appointed head of the GSA, Emily Murphy, determined that she had no legal standing to determine a winner in the presidential race because Trump was still challenging the results in court. That held up funding and cooperation for the transition.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump\u2019s win touches off a mix of celebration and trepidation in the Philly region\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Trump\u2019s efforts to subvert election results had collapsed across key states that Murphy agreed to formally \u201cascertain a president-elect\u201d and begin the transition process. Trump eventually posted on social media that his administration would cooperate.\n\nTo prevent that kind of holdup in future transitions, the Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 mandates that the transition process begin five days after the election \u2014 even if the winner is still in dispute. That is designed to avoid long delays and means that \u201can \u2018affirmative ascertainment\u2019 by the GSA is no longer a prerequisite for gaining transition support services,\u201d according to agency guidelines on the new rules.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump\u2019s growing support among Latino voters helped him clinch battleground Pennsylvania\n\nThe uncertainty stretched even longer after the 2000 election, when five weeks elapsed before the Supreme Court settled the contested election between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. That left Bush with about half the usual amount of time to manage transitioning the government from the outgoing Clinton administration. That ultimately led to questions about national security gaps that may have contributed to the U.S. being underprepared for the Sept. 11 attacks the following year."
