UK\u2019s most famous UFO sighting could finally be solved 45 years on \u2013 as expert reveals \u2018electromagnetic PLASMA\u2019 theory\n\nTHE UK's most famous UFO sighting could finally be solved 45 years on - as an expert revealed a new \"electromagnetic plasma\" theory.\n\nMystery lights spotted by SAS troopers in December 1980 could have been down to a \"mass psychosis\" caused by \"electromagnetic plasma\" coming from the earth, they revealed.\n\n3 The mystery lights are believed to be down to a 'mass psychosis'. Pictured, a sculpture now at the site Credit: Alamy\n\n3 The Rendlesham Forest UFO incident information board Credit: Alamy\n\n3 The plasma theory was first put forward by Dr Ron Haddow Credit: Alamy\n\nMany high ranking officers from the US Air Force personnel reported seeing a triangular alien craft in Rendlesham Forest, a remote part of Suffolk.\n\nOne even claimed to have got close enough to touch a \"triangular spacecraft\".\n\nBut despite multiple investigations into the sighting no explanation for the glowing scenes was ever found.\n\nPhilip Mantle, an expert in UFO sightings, has revealed he may know what really happened that night.\n\n\"If you look at what those involved said to begin with, the only concrete info was that they saw strange lights in the forest - that's what we start with,\" he told Metro.\n\nThe plasma theory was first put forward by Dr Ron Haddow.\n\nPhillip said: \"He was concerned this plasma emitted a type of electromagnetic energy, which could interfere with aircraft communications of cause cognitive impairment.\"\n\nBritish UFO expert Albert Budden later showed that the Earth produces electromagnetic forces which can emit light - otherwise called the plasma.\n\nPhillip added: \"Some people can be hypersensitive to these lights - in other words allergic - and can have the most bizarre experience you'll think is absolutely real.\n\n\"It could be these soldiers came into contact with it and all hallucinated.\"\n\nHe also discounted old theories, which suggested SAS troops staged the sighting as revenge on US troops, saying \"pranking\" would not have taken place in the heat of the Cold War.\n\nThe theory was upheld by UFO enthusiast Dr David Clarke who said, \"lights and coloured flares were rigged in the woods and black helium balloons were coupled to remote-controlled kites.\"\n\nBut like Phillip, former Ministry of Defence UFO investigator Nick Pope, told the Sun Online he was sceptical of such claims.\n\nNasa discovers mysterious green spots on Mars that could be signs of ancient alien life Despite its nickname of 'the Red Planet', mysterious green dots have been discovered in the sand on Mars. Nasa's Perseverance rover, which has been navigating Mars for nearly four years, stumbled upon the new mystery in a region called \"Serpentine Rapids\". After scraping away the top layer of regolith in a red rock outcrop named \"Wallace Butte\", the rover uncovered a \"striking\" array of colours within the rock, Nasa wrote. Colours of white, black and even green were discovered. \"One of the biggest surprises for the rover team was the presence of the drab-green-colored spots within the abrasion patch, which are composed of dark-toned cores with fuzzy, light green rims,\" Nasa added. The green patches can also be found on Earth's so-called 'red beds' - areas of sediment where water, carrying iron, has filtered through, and eventually hardens into rock.\n\nHe told the Sun Online: \"It's classic friend-of-a-friend stuff: a ufologist claims he was contacted by a former SAS soldier, who claims he was involved in a prank.\n\n\"Frankly, there's no evidence such a prank even occurred, let alone that it played a role in the infamous Rendlesham Forest incident.\n\n\"Having undertaken a cold case review of this incident for the MoD, I can confirm that the events in Rendlesham Forest 40 years ago remain unexplained.\n\nThe US airman Jim Penniston's claim that he touched the aircraft is also dubious, according Philip, who said his account changed over time.\n\nHe said: \"Jim underwent hypnosis a few years back and said the craft was a machine from the futures.\"\n\nHe admitted however that the plasma theory could also be an incorrect assumption as UFO researchers all \"suffer confirmation bias\".\n\nHe added: \"But I'm sure Rendlesham's legend will only continue to grow in the years ahead.\""

            "article_content": "British UFO expert and filmmaker, Mark Christopher Lee\n\nBritish UFO expert and filmmaker, Mark Christopher Lee, has asserted that the images of a mysterious orb at Manchester Airport are unequivocally evidence of a UFO. Recently delving into so-called \"drone\" episodes at military installations across the UK, Lee is now scrutinising the curious event at Manchester Airport. The imagery, dating back to June, has sparked a wildfire of speculation on social media platforms like X (once known as Twitter) and Reddit, where it was shared. The footage depicts a round entity captured by an alleged co-pilot on the tarmac, seen either soaring in the sky or \"hovering\" just above ground near another plane. These events trail a spate of similar sightings, specifically several orbs spotted over Washington DC's supposed no-fly zone. The person who released the Manchester sighting description claimed the UAP matched the size of a small vehicle. Intrigued, Mark Lee has flagged this incident as particularly noteworthy. Drawing parallels with historical accounts, he mentioned: \"This blue orb sighting reminds me of UK researcher Timothy Good who wrote about the Australian government capturing an alien sphere in 1957 - it was made of an unknown substance and had no visible means of levitation.\"\n\nWARNING TAKEN FROM TWITTERCAPTION: UAP at Manchester Airport causes frenzy on Reddit with alien fansLINK: https://x.com/PNWMPA/status/1861843806074876103/photo/1\n\nLee elaborated that this peculiar object was apprehended at Woomera's Nuclear test facility in Australia and eventually found its way to the Wright Patterson Airforce Base in the USA, reports the Daily Star. Discussing the recent Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) activity he's been investigating, he stated: \"People are assuming that the UAP sightings at military bases in the East of England are Russian drones. But eye witnesses of locals who have seen these UAPs state that they move very slowly and if they are Russian how did they get here - have they flown all this way at such a slow speed\" Mark further revealed that his research for his new film - The Rendelsham UFO - The British Roswell - about an alleged UFO landing at a military base in Suffolk in 1980 (RAF Bentwaters) - has led him to believe that an alien intelligence is constantly monitoring our military bases (particularly those with Nuclear weapons). With global tensions currently high, he believes the alien presence has increased its surveillance using AI drones.\n\nUAP at Manchester Airport causes frenzy on Reddit with alien fans\n\nHe said: \"What we found with the Rendelsham UFO - was that an alien presence was monitoring the Nuclear weapons that were being stored at RAF Bentwaters as part of the NATO defence during the Cold War.\" However, a spokesperson from Manchester Airport dismissed any theories of extraterrestrial visitors in this case. He suggested that the most likely explanation is either a weather or helium balloon, and questioned the authenticity of the photograph showing an object hovering above the ground on the airfield. \"We have systems that pick up anything that could be a threat to aviation,\" he said. He stated: \"Anything that gives off a signal we would know about.\" He added that if there was anything on the airfield, as depicted in the photograph, it would be treated as a major incident, and no such disruption-causing event has occurred.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

AI audio maker ElevenLabs is solving that with a new feature that reshapes documents you upload into an audio show with virtual hosts discussing the subject matter. The newGenFM feature is part of the ElevenLabs Reader App and will turn any mix of PDFs, articles, and digital books into your own personal podcast episodes.\n\nThe new feature shares many similarities with Google NotebookLM, which uses Google Gemini AI models to turn documents into podcast-style shows where synthetic personalities discuss whatever you've uploaded to each other. As with Google's feature, GenFM analyzes the information you upload and produces a synthetic podcast with two AI co-hosts discussing the material. GenFM even attempts to match the voices to the topic under discussion.\n\nIf you're an auditory learner or need to absorb information while doing other things, GenFM is likely to appeal to you. That said, while GenFM restricts itself to the documents you upload, you'll likely still want to be wary of any accidental hallucinations or misunderstood data. You can see and hear some examples in the demo video below.\n\nAI podcast future\n\nThough GenFM and Google NotebookLM are pursuing the same kind of product, ElevenLabs' AI-generated podcast efforts are a step beyond Google's. NotebookLM is currently limited to the web and can only make shows in English. In contrast, GenFM's AI hosts can converse in 32 languages. Still, both tools cater to more diverse ways of learning and lifestyles.\n\nThe potential demand from students alone will likely justify the work behind GenFM. And, unlike some other ways AI composition tools are used in academia, this doesn't raise ethical questions about cheating or plagiarism. They also increase accessibility to those with impaired vision who don't want to hear a long document read out when they could hear a podcast about it. They also democratize access to information, enabling individuals with visual impairments or reading difficulties to engage with content more easily.\n\nYou might also like"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence continues to achieve remarkable breakthroughs, yet its latest contribution might come as a surprise to many. According to a report by CNBC, AI can solve one of the biggest problems facing the USA: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit. According to three economists from the Brookings Institution, artificial intelligence could prove a positive \u201ccritical shock\u201d for the country\u2019s fiscal health.\n\nREAD NOW: 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings\n\nThe Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings released a working paper last month stating that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044. This would lower annual budget deficits by roughly one-fifth at the end of the 20 years.\n\n\u201cThe use of AI presents the rare \u2014 possibly unique \u2014 opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system\u201d.\n\nWhile adopting AI in healthcare is optimistic, Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management, reveals how economists\u2019 outlook on AI and healthcare is \u201ca mix of enthusiasm and despair\u201d.\n\n\u201cEnthusiasm because there\u2019s probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. \u2026 But there\u2019s friction due to regulation, due to incentives \u2014 because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things \u2014 and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities\u201d.\n\nIn other news, CNBC reported that OpenAI has allowed its employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank. Current and former OpenAI employees will be able to cash out their shares this way, while the Japanese tech conglomerate will be able to get a larger slice of the pie of the AI startup. The tender offer follows the persistence of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after he made a $500 million investment in OpenAI's recent funding round, also reflecting his growing interest in AI.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory Continues"

With this, Workspace users can access the Gemini mobile app as a core service and use it for organisational tasks. Earlier, these users could only access Gemini capabilities on the web and within certain apps such as Google Docs or Gmail. The Mountain View-based tech giant highlighted that this move will allow enterprise users to use the AI chatbot on the go.\n\nGemini Mobile App Now Available for Google Workspace Users\n\nIn a blog post, the company stated that the Gemini app for Android and iOS will now let Workspace users sign into the app with their organisation account and access all the enterprise-grade features which are not available on the regular version of the app. Apart from using the AI chatbot for research and finding answers to their queries, users can also capture images of handwritten notes with the device's camera and export them to Google Docs or Gmail.\n\nAdditionally, Google Workspace users can also create visualisations of a chart that was drawn on a whiteboard when signed into the Gemini mobile app. The tech giant said users will continue to get all the enterprise-grade data protections that they do on the web.\n\nThe Gemini app for Workspace accounts will be available in 150 countries and will support 46 languages. However, some of the features available to enterprise users on the web will not be supported on the app currently. For instance, users will not be able to use Workspace extensions, file upload, and Gems.\n\nAdditionally, Work Profile is not supported on the Gemini app for Android. On the other hand, users will not be able to authenticate their Workspace account on the Google app for iOS which also includes Gemini. To access the AI features for enterprise purposes, users will need to install the standalone Gemini app.\n\nGoogle is also expanding access to the Gemini app for all Education users. Those with the qualifying edition will get the chatbot as a core service, and others can avail it as an additional service."

Dudleytown, a deserted settlement within the Dark Entry Forest in Cornwall, Connecticut, is infamous for its eerie history, supernatural lore, and a supposed curse that has haunted the land and its settlers.Dudleytown was established in the early 1740s when members of the Dudley family, along with others, settled in the valley. Named after the family, this area initially served as farmland. However, due to the region\u2019s infertile soil and rocky terrain, many residents left by the 19th century in search of better opportunities.The town\u2019s decline wasn\u2019t just about agriculture\u2014it was riddled with peculiar deaths and inexplicable tragedies. Nathaniel Carter, one of the settlers, lost six family members to cholera before relocating to New York, where his remaining family members were tragically killed. Similarly, Gershon Hollister died under mysterious circumstances while building a barn, and his neighbor, William Tanner, was said to be tormented by visions of creatures emerging from the woods at night.General Herman Swift, a Revolutionary War hero, faced personal tragedy when his wife was struck by lightning on their porch. Overcome with grief, he, too, met a tragic end. Stories of mysterious deaths and bizarre occurrences led many to believe the town was cursed.Legend has it that the misfortunes of Dudleytown trace back to a curse on the Dudley family. This curse allegedly began with Edmund Dudley, an English nobleman executed for treason during King Henry VIII\u2019s reign. His descendants, said to be plagued by death and disaster, carried this supposed curse to America. However, historians have found no direct link between Edmund Dudley and the Dudleys of Dudleytown, debunking this aspect of the legend.Despite this, the stories persisted, bolstered by unexplained phenomena reported by residents. Some claimed to see ghostly figures lurking in the forest, while others spoke of \"phantom hands\" touching trespassers who dared to explore the abandoned site.By 1900, Dudleytown was entirely deserted. The last family to live there either vanished or perished, leaving only crumbling cellar holes and stone foundations as remnants of the town. In 1918, Dr. William Clarke purchased the land and attempted to make it a vacation home. However, his wife reported terrifying encounters with creatures in the woods, prompting the couple to abandon the property.Dr. Clarke later helped establish the Dark Entry Forest Association, which aimed to preserve the forest and protect it from further intrusion. Today, the site is private property, and trespassers face legal action.Despite warnings from the Connecticut State Police, thrill-seekers and ghost enthusiasts still attempt to visit Dudleytown, drawn by tales of paranormal activity. Many claim to feel an inexplicable presence, with some reporting being touched by unseen forces. These chilling accounts, combined with the area's dark history, continue to fuel the town\u2019s reputation as one of America\u2019s most haunted locations.Dudleytown remains a compelling tale of tragedy, mystery, and folklore\u2014a ghost town that, for better or worse, refuses to fade into obscurity."

These vertical columns of light, mistaken for paranormal activity, are actually a natural optical illusion formed by ice crystals reflecting light under specific weather conditions\n\nRecently in Central Alberta, Canada, residents witnessed a beautiful spectacle of light pillars that illuminated the night sky during the winter. These columns of light appear to rise from the ground and stretch up into the dark, creating an ethereal visual spectacle. While many people are led to believe that these columns of light are paranormal, they are, in fact, a natural optical illusion that is created under specific weather conditions.\n\nThe Science Behind Light Pillars\n\nLight pillars are a phenomenon that is formed when the light sources like streetlights or building lights reflect off tiny hexagonal ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. The ice crystals are as small as 0.02 mm in diameter and function like mirrors. As light hits the ice crystals, it is reflected, giving the appearance of vertical columns shooting into the sky. The illusion can be almost magical, with beams of light soaring high above the ground to cast a shimmering glow over the dark sky.\n\nCheck out the visuals here\n\nLight pillar season has begun in Alberta, Canada \ud83d\udd38 Light pillars are caused by light reflecting off ice crystals suspended in the air. This phenomenon occurs in cold places where the temperature allows hexagonal ice crystals to form. For example, these photos were taken at\u2026 pic.twitter.com/F3Rk55UXaV \u2014 Malinda \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea (@TreasChest) November 26, 2024\n\nLight pillar season has begun in Alberta, Canada \ud83d\udd38 Light pillars are caused by light reflecting off ice crystals suspended in the air. This phenomenon occurs in cold places where the temperature allows hexagonal ice crystals to form.

They are not associated with otherworldly or paranormal activity. Generally, the phenomenon is most common in colder climates, especially during the winter months when the temperatures plummet. Ideal conditions for light pillars include temperatures ranging from -10\u00b0C to -40\u00b0C, high humidity, and still air. Under these conditions, ice crystals form and reflect the light, thus creating this fantastic visual effect.\n\nAlberta, along with other cold regions like Russia and parts of Scandinavia, is an ideal location for witnessing this extraordinary natural wonder. While the light pillars may seem to originate directly from the light sources, they are actually an optical illusion, created by the reflection of light off the suspended ice crystals, often located high in the atmosphere.\n\nA Winter Marvel in Alberta\n\nFor those in Alberta, who have to bear the bitter cold, light pillars provide a moment of awe amidst the harsh winter conditions. Despite the freezing temperatures and biting wind-chill, the phenomenon offers a reminder of the mysterious beauty that nature can create. The stunning display transforms the icy winter landscape into a celestial wonder, providing residents and observers with an unforgettable winter experience.\n\nALSO READ: Rare First Edition Of Harry Potter Book \u2013 One Of Only 500 Copies \u2013 Sells For \u20b938 Lakh At UK Auction"

            "article_content": "The way scientific research is conceived is changing. AI has moved from being a passive tool to an active collaborator in the scientific process. A survey revealed that LLMs are fast emerging as an essential tool for doctoral students in their research.\n\n\u201cIn the next couple of years, we will get to a place where we have an AI scientist. Then you can apply a much faster rate of scientific progress,\u201d said venture capitalist Vinod Khosla in a recent interview while talking about AI\u2019s potential in scientific discovery.\n\nThis vision is already taking shape. In a new study, Stanford researchers introduced the concept of \u2018Virtual Lab\u2019, an AI-human collaboration framework designed for interdisciplinary scientific research\u2014in this case, designing and validating new nanobodies for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThis system employs a team of large language model (LLM) agents, each specialised in various fields, to assist human researchers in addressing scientific problems.\n\nBuilt in Python, it uses GPT-4o as its default LLM but supports easy replacement with other models\u2014unlike other research frameworks like ChemCrow and Coscientist, which rely on fixed or predefined LLM agents.\n\nIn such a structure, the agents do more than just performing computations. They engage in discussions, propose solutions, and critically evaluate outcomes\u2013 making them more than mere tools in the scientific process.\n\nInside Virtual Lab\n\nThe multi-agent AI architecture described in this research is designed to mimic an interdisciplinary team of scientists. The workflow begins with defining roles for AI agents like principal investigators (PI), scientist agents, and a scientific critic. The research progresses through structured \u201cteam meetings\u201d for broad discussions and \u201cindividual meetings\u201d for specific tasks.\n\nAI agents discuss, critique, and refine ideas collaboratively, using tools like AlphaFold, Rosetta, and machine learning models to design nanobodies for SARS-CoV-2 variants. The human researcher sets agendas and integrates results, streamlining complex, interdisciplinary research with the help of AI.\n\nA \u201cscientific critic\u201d agent ensures rigorous evaluation, enhancing output robustness, while the \u201cprincipal investigator\u201d agent synthesises inputs, simulates leadership and overcomes challenges in coordinating knowledge across domains.\n\n\u201cThe LLM agents in the Virtual Lab serve as an extremely helpful resource for producing research ideas and experimental workflows, and code for research projects. But, it is up to the human researcher to double-check the validity of the decisions made by the LLM agents,\u201d Kyle Swanson, a researcher at Stanford and co-author of this study, told AIM, commenting on the importance of human-in-the-loop for such experiments, at least currently.\n\nWhile LLM agents are valuable for generating research ideas, workflows, and code, researchers must verify their accuracy\u2014as they are capable of hallucinations and errors.\n\nSwanson explained that although using multiple agents and the scientific critic can assist in spotting errors, this method is not foolproof, as all agents might make the same mistake. He also noted that offering extra context, like relevant research papers, can help reduce hallucinations, but won\u2019t completely eliminate them.\n\nFuture of Interdisciplinary Scientific Discovery\n\nGoogle DeepMind\u2019s recent essay too highlights AI\u2019s growing role in science. AI speeds up knowledge-sharing with LLMs, helps generate and label data (like predicting protein functions), and boosts research, it said.\n\nTools like AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 are solving tough problems in drug design and algorithm optimisation. In May 2024, DeepMind released AlphaFold 3, an open-sourced, game-changing protein folding model that predicts with 50% better accuracy. Demis Hassabis and John M Jumper, two Google DeepMind scientists, were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for AlphaFold2.\n\nThis Stanford study references Jumper\u2019s AlphaFold 2 paper as an illustration of interdisciplinary research. It highlights how modern scientific research involves large, diverse teams, which shows the collaborative nature of complex scientific research.\n\nBeyond Virtual Lab\n\nInterestingly, the Virtual Lab architecture can be expanded to other fields in drug discovery and material science with broader agent expertise. It is designed to be easily adaptable to a wide range of scientific applications, and its core elements are domain-agnostic.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the Virtual Lab will continue to improve as the underlying LLMs get better,\u201d said Kyle. \u201cWe also hope to incorporate more tools to give it more capabilities,\u201d he added, suggesting improvements such as powering internet searches or giving access to GitHub repositories, which could help it acquire new knowledge and utilise tools beyond its training.\n\nExperiments like these democratise access to entry-level knowledge. Virtual lab designed 92 nanobody candidates across four rounds, which were then experimentally validated. This efficiency showcases how resource-limited settings can achieve impactful results using AI collaboration.\n\n[This story is read by 1,955 unique people]\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "December is almost here, which means it is almost the start of the Advent season.\n\nWhile many equate Advent with calendars full of treats leading up to Christmas Day on Dec. 25, Advent is a term that comes out of Western Christianity and is the season encompassing the four Sundays (and the weekdays) leading up to the celebration of Christmas, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nAdvent started as a time for remembrance and a sign for Christians to be open and ready for the second coming of Christ and held to traditional items and events like a wreath with candles, a large feast at the end of the four Sundays and, of course, the Advent calendar.\n\nMany of the traditions around Advent have been adopted by mainstream culture as part of traditions for people who celebrate Christmas, especially the Advent calendar, which has taken a place in the holiday season for many whether they are Christian or not.\n\nHere's a look at the traditions some Christians uphold during this time of year and how some of those came to be mainstream.\n\nWhat is Advent?\n\nAdvent is the start of the Christian church's liturgical year. It starts four weeks ahead of Christmas, which usually is the last Sunday in November or the first Sunday of December. The start date changes every year.\n\nThe term Advent is from \"ad-venire\" in Latin and means \"to come to.\"\n\nThe Catholic church sees it as \"a time of preparation that directs our hearts and minds to Christ\u2019s second coming at the end of time and to the anniversary of Our Lord\u2019s birth on Christmas.\"\n\nDuring this time, the Christian faith has followers that reflect on scriptures of what they believe to be the second coming, but also a time for penance before Christmas with feasts, presents and more.\n\nWhen is Advent 2024?\n\nAdvent this year starts Sunday, Dec. 1, and runs through Christmas Eve on Tuesday, Dec. 24.\n\nWho celebrates Advent?\n\nWhile some of the traditions of Advent are seen leading up to the Christmas holiday, Advent itself is associated with Western Christianity. Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Episcopalians, Lutherans and many other Protestant churches mark the roughly month-long period with special observance.\n\nHow did we get Advent calendars?\n\nAdvent calendars were adopted at some point in the 19th century by German Lutherans as a way to mark the days of the season leading up to Christmas. Most of the time the days were marked by Bible readings or pieces from the Christian Christmas story.\n\nAs times changed, so did the Advent calendar.\n\nThere are now hundreds of Advent calendars available that don't always quite cover the days Advent is observed and usually start on Dec. 1. Calendars help to herald the arrival of Christmas by marking each day with something like a piece of candy, a small gift or even full-size products, depending on how much you want to spend.\n\nIn recent years, Advent calendars of every shape and size are available, from the ones you buy at the grocery store with a piece of chocolate each day to Advent calendars with makeup, Funko Pops and Squishmallows. Swarovski even has its own Advent calendar that sells for $1,200."

Not all attempts have been well received, so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Humane AI Pin, a brainchild of Apple veterans, failed to make a splash, despite blending an AI-first voice-driven user interface and a cool laser projector doubling as a screen on your palms. The story of the Rabbit R1 hasn't been particularly inspiring either. A few others, like the Plaud Note Pin, are trying to solve a niche problem.\n\nYet, there is no shortage of companies trying to shoehorn AI into mainstream products. Some of the attempts are rather ingenious, but a few elicit confused chuckles. In the past couple of years, and especially in the wake of the generative AI revolution, we have seen some rather astounding AI-charged products.\n\nWhat follows is a list of those kinds of unexpected offerings \u2014 you may find yourself wondering why such pointless products exist, or realizing these are the gadgets you've always needed.\n\nAdvertisement"
