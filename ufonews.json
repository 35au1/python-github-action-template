        "article_content": "Amid the political spectacle of the election, former President Donald Trump appeared on Joe Rogan\u2019s popular podcast and spoke about UFOs. According to Trump, Air Force pilots told him how mysterious spherical objects outperformed one of the most advanced fighter jets America has.\n\nSimilar accounts date back to at least the 1940s. More recently, military encounters with spherical objects and other unknown craft that exhibit seemingly extraordinary capabilities generated a series of eyebrow-raising headlines.\n\nBut a host of other, ostensibly credible UFO-related allegations is even more remarkable.\n\nLast month, Kirk McConnell, a recently retired 37-year veteran professional staff member on the congressional armed services and intelligence committees, confirmed publicly that whistleblowers provided firsthand testimony to Congress alleging the existence of ultra-secret programs that retrieve and seek to reverse engineer advanced craft of unknown or non-human origin.\n\nMcConnell is not alone. He joins Sen Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence; former House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wisc.); and ex-intelligence official David Grusch, who have all stated publicly that individuals with firsthand knowledge have confirmed the existence of such efforts to Congress or to the internal watchdog that oversees America\u2019s spy agencies.\n\nSuch remarkable statements provide important context for what is arguably the most extraordinary legislation ever proposed in Congress.\n\nIntroduced by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act defines \u201cnon-human intelligence,\u201d \u201ctechnologies of unknown origin\u201d and \u201clegacy program.\u201d\n\nAs characterized in the bipartisan Disclosure Act, \u201clegacy program\u201d refers to any \u201cendeavors to collect, exploit, or reverse engineer technologies of unknown origin or examine biological evidence of living or deceased non-human intelligence.\u201d The term \u201cnon-human intelligence\u201d appears two dozen times throughout the 64-page legislation.\n\nThe Disclosure Act would also require the U.S. government to take possession of \u201cany and all\u201d recovered UFOs and \u201cbiological evidence of non-human intelligence\u201d transferred to private defense contractors.\n\nIn an extraordinary exchange with Rounds on the Senate floor, Schumer stated that \u201cmultiple credible sources\u201d have alleged that elements of the U.S. government have illegally withheld information on UFOs from Congress.\n\nOf equal importance, key members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, in tandem with other seemingly credible sources, have indicated that some of America\u2019s rivals may also have retrieved technologies of unknown origin.\n\nIf, for example, China and Russia have recovered such highly advanced technology, the profound geopolitical implications \u2014 including enormous risks to global security and stability \u2014 must be addressed proactively and without delay.\n\nAt the same time, according to investigative reporter Michael Shellenberger, a new, unnamed whistleblower provided a detailed report to Congress describing a secret government program to \u201cdetect, quarantine, and transfer\u201d observations of UFOs by the military\u2019s most advanced sensors to a secret database.\n\nDubbed \u201cImmaculate Constellation,\u201d the alleged program serves simultaneously as a master repository of radar, infrared, satellite and other UFO observations from sensitive sensor platforms, as well as an internal security process for keeping such data outside of normal military and intelligence communications channels.\n\nIf ultra-sensitive UFO data is indeed isolated and sequestered in such a secret database, it may, for example, explain how the Pentagon\u2019s UFO analysis office can plausibly claim that it has received very little truly anomalous data.\n\nAt the same time, virtually every former living president, along with a bipartisan cohort of former CIA chiefs, ex-directors of national intelligence and top military officials, has made astounding statements about UFOs in recent years.\n\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan, for example, stated in late 2020 that a \u201cdifferent form of life\u201d may be behind recent military UFO incidents. Six months later, former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe said that UFOs exhibit technologies \u201cthat we don\u2019t have and, frankly, that we are not capable of defending against.\u201d\n\nMoreover, a series of brazen incursions around sensitive military facilities \u2014 including nuclear missile silos \u2014 by objects exhibiting seemingly advanced capabilities has left the U.S. government thoroughly baffled.\n\nNotably, by displaying bright flashing lights and flying in various formations, these objects are operating with seemingly brazen impunity around key military assets. Regardless of the nature of these incursions \u2014 be they bizarrely theatrical foreign intelligence gathering operations or otherwise \u2014 Congress must demand answers from the military and intelligence community.\n\nWith the House and Senate both slated to conduct UFO-related hearings in November, Congress has its work cut out for it. At a bare minimum, the sweeping government transparency and disclosure measures mandated by the Disclosure Act make it must-pass legislation.\n\nMarik von Rennenkampff served as an analyst with the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, as well as an Obama administration appointee at the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "article_content": "Carl Petrick is a sky-watcher.\n\nThe East Moline resident and Moline native is a retired longtime zookeeper at Niabi Zoo. He studies his surroundings with scientific attention. Science is his religion, Petrick said. The 66-year-old just wants to figure it all out.\n\n\u201cMoving things,\u201d in particular, are fascinating to him. He\u2019s an avid bird-watcher. Birds\u2019 camouflaging abilities, their ability to fly into the wind, their speed \u2014 it\u2019s all impressive to Petrick.\n\n\u201cPeople are smart, but we can't do some of the things they do,\u201d he said.\n\nPetrick is willing to go to great lengths to identify birds he spots in local parks \u2014 once, he chased a bird 50 yards just to get answers after he glimpsed it through a bush. Eventually, he tracked it down.\n\nBut there\u2019s one flyer that got away. It\u2019s nagged at him for more than 50 years.\n\nPetrick is one of several Quad-Citians who reported seeing UFOs over several days in early March 1967. At the time, Petrick was a 9-year-old student at Sacred Heart Catholic School, now Seton Catholic, in Moline.\n\nThe record of this local UFO phenomenon, which stretched across multiple counties in western Illinois, is part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force investigation of UFOs in the 1950s and 1960s, a time of heightened concern due to the Cold War.\n\nNuns, sheriff\u2019s deputies, elementary students and more reported seeing something in the sky that spring.\n\nThe story is still vivid in Petrick\u2019s head.\n\nIf he stares long enough at a wall, he can close his eyes and see it like it was yesterday.\n\nIt\u2019s not an airplane\n\nPetrick saw it between 2 and 3 p.m., as he went back inside for class, he said. The weather was chilly but clear.\n\n\u201cI looked up and I saw something in the distance,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nTo his naked eye, the object in the western sky looked like a spot or a small silvery thing. He estimated its height to be like that of airplanes when they emit contrails as they fly over.\n\nAs Petrick watched the object, Bill Fisher, a Moline police officer, came around the corner. The officer had binoculars or a movie camera with him. Fisher looked at the object then handed the instrument he carried to Petrick.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d the police officer asked the boy.\n\nWith the instrument\u2019s assistance, Petrick saw a silver, cigar-shaped object with what Petrick described as three long windows along the side. Those windows were powder blue, like the jersey shade of the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThe thing was not moving and Petrick estimated its length to be between 20 and 40 feet.\n\nPetrick told Fisher the thing was not an airplane, then the police officer said he had to go.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last I saw of him,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nThat day, Fisher recorded the object with a portable 8mm movie camera. He and his recording would be a central part of the Air Force\u2019s investigation.\n\nAfter Fisher left, Petrick watched the object for about 10 more minutes before returning to class, he said. About 30 or 45 minutes later, he came back outside.\n\n\u201cIt was still there,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nAt home a short time later, he observed it again with his father and brother, using a small telescope. The object still had not moved and its appearance remained the same.\n\nPetrick does not know what the object was, but he said he knows what it wasn\u2019t. It was not a bird or a butterfly, he said. It was not an airplane, helicopter or zeppelin.\n\nBy the process of elimination, he concluded it was a UFO.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, so obviously and logically, it would be unidentified,\u201d he said. \u201cJust common sense.\u201d\n\nNow decades removed from the event, Petrick said he does not think the object had a human origin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not from here,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just observing us like we observe.\u201d\n\nPetrick said he saw the object in the same place in the sky for several days after those initial sightings.\n\nThen, one day, it wasn\u2019t there.\n\nInitially, he thought it might have moved. After a bit more time, he decided it was gone for good.\n\nDuck and cover\n\nAt the time of the Quad-Cities sighting, the Cold War was in full swing. The rivalry between America and the Soviet Union even extended into space.\n\nPetrick remembered a childhood game he and his friends played, inspired by the monthly emergency siren tests. When they heard the siren, the children would pretend the Russians were attacking.\n\nPeople feared a nuclear holocaust, Petrick said. Incidents like the Bay of Pigs had occurred and the conflict in Vietnam was heating up.\n\n\u201cWe were so inundated with the Cold War\u2019s \u2018Russians are bad, we\u2019re good,\u2019\u201d Petrick said.\n\nHe also described an exercise he had to do at school: the duck-and-cover drill.\n\n\u201cIf the siren goes off, get under your desk because if a bomb explodes, you\u2019ll be protected,\u201d he said.\n\nShould they find themselves in the hallway, children were supposed to get against the wall and cover themselves as best they could, he said.\n\nThe school phased that drill out while he was still a student.\n\nThere was also a big emphasis on science in school because of the Cold War. The Russians had their Sputnik satellite. The Americans were after the Moon.\n\nAfter he saw the object in the sky that day, Petrick said, he considered, then discarded, the possibility that another nation was behind it.\n\n\u201cIf it was Russian or Chinese or whatever, you think it would have been attacking the States or would have been doing something to throw us off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just sat there.\u201d\n\nNot just Petrick\n\nPetrick wasn\u2019t the only person in the Quad-Cities who spotted a UFO that week. The local newspapers covered the phenomenon extensively.\n\nJames Maifield, of Silvis, reported that he and his wife spotted a \u201cwhite light\u201d in the sky for several minutes. An anonymous Silvis police dispatcher told the Moline Dispatch she saw a \u201cweird\u201d white light, too.\n\nGary Bennett, an Augustana College student, told the Times-Democrat he saw an \u201cunfamiliar airborne vehicle\u201d around 9:30 p.m. on March 9.\n\nArnold Buchmeyer, Helen DeRocker and Leo Schmitz, all of Moline, separately reported to the Times-Democrat that they saw something strange in the sky, too. Schmitz said it was \u201cvery white\u201d and \u201cmoving northwesterly.\u201d\n\nA Northwestern University astronomer speculated that it was just the planet Venus.\n\nThe weekend after the sightings, pranksters were caught deploying a balloon with a candle that crash-landed in Rock Island. A similar balloon was found near the Monmouth waste disposal plant on Thursday, March 9, pieced together with soda straws.\n\nJimmie Scott, a 12-year-old from Buffalo, Iowa, told the Times-Democrat he got out of bed around 2 a.m. on March 9 to get a drink of water. He looked into the sky and saw a \u201cbright, white object that looked like a saucer.\u201d\n\nHis sketch of the saucer was published on the front pages of the Times-Democrat.\n\nThe principal witness, though, was Fisher, the Moline officer who greeted Petrick on the campus of Sacred Heart.\n\nThe star witness\n\nAfter the Quad-Cities area sightings drew the attention of the federal government, Fisher was interviewed at length by the U.S. Air Force, who sent Capt. Edward Orenic and Capt. Anton Kato to investigate.\n\nAfter their visit, they produced a 94-page report on their methods, avenues of inquiry and conclusions. The report is available online through the U.S. National Archives.\n\nThe two captains cast a wide net, the report shows. Their efforts included interviewing witnesses and collecting weather data. They also checked with regional military, airport and National Weather Service officials for aircraft and weather balloon flights as well as for reports of anything strange.\n\nOrenic and Kato took particular interest in Fisher\u2019s account and the footage he took.\n\nThe officer told the Air Force that he was initially at Sacred Heart on March 9 to deliver a message to his son, a student there. He arrived around 1:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cAt this time, I glanced upward above the treetops and viewed a object that I was not sure of its description or its identity,\u201d he told investigators.\n\nHe described the object as \u201cU-shaped \u2014 like a pickle,\u201d and said he watched it for \u201ca precious minute and a half.\u201d Soon after, he began shooting footage with his 8mm camera, using a telescopic lens and outdoor film. The footage is also available online in the U.S. National Archives.\n\nFisher told the Dispatch in 2015 that he kept the camera in storage on his motorcycle, aware that UFO rumors were already swirling in town.\n\n\u201cThere were stories all around,\u201d he told the Dispatch. \u201cI was just naturally curious.\u201d\n\nAfter he arrived on the campus, Fisher says the object then began moving \u201cnorthwesterly\u201d away from him. It \u201cappeared to have stopped\u201d and hovered, he said, and then it continued its pace until it faded from view.\n\n\u201cBefore it faded away here, before it got completely obscure, I did have a definite sighting of a metallic, shiny surface on the side,\u201d he said. \u201cThe side that was the broad side to me, was metallic and appeared to be of the same construction like some of our large aircrafts that I\u2019ve seen here.\u201d\n\nAs he stood at the school, Fisher asked several kids and a state policeman\u2019s wife about what they saw. The woman told him it \u201clooked shiny and reflected a white light.\u201d Fisher said he didn\u2019t spot any lights or objects connected to the craft. He heard no sound emitted from the object, but the woman reported a hissing or whirring sound.\n\nIn the report, captains Orenic and Kato also highlighted the accounts of two sheriff\u2019s deputies, one from Knox County and the other from Henry County.\n\nThe Knox County deputy\u2019s account was that early on March 6, 1967, he saw a flying object.\n\nHis account included that it was shaped like an upside-down bowl, the report states. It had a glowing red base and at one point emitted a bright beam of white light.\n\nThe deputy from Henry County saw something in the sky late on March 8, the report states.\n\nThe deputy\u2019s description included that the object was framed by three lights \u2014 one red, one white and one green. Periodically it would emit an intense red light bright enough to obscure the other three lights.\n\nSo what\u2019s the verdict?\n\nOrenic and Kato concluded at the end of the report that the sightings most likely involved the mundane.\n\nIn Fisher\u2019s case, the object was most likely an air vehicle \u2013 a plane or helicopter, the report states. In another part of the report, Orenic and Kato also state it could have been a balloon.\n\n\u201cThe description, duration and flight characteristics are similar to that of a balloon,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe 8mm film failed to reveal any information that would dispute this evaluation.\u201d\n\nThe captains said the Henry County deputy\u2019s sighting was also likely an aircraft.\n\nThe Knox County sighting was probably of a home-made hot air balloon created using a garment bag, similar to the one Rock Island pranksters made the weekend of March 12, and the one recovered in the Monmouth area. The method of making the balloons had been published in a national magazine, the report states.\n\nDuring that period, two red kites along with batteries and a light bulb were also recovered in the Galesburg area, according to the report.\n\nNearly all the witnesses Orenic and Kato interviewed appeared extremely reliable but had a \u201cstrong desire to see something\u201d or an attitude of \u201cthought I\u2019d never see a saucer,\u201d the report states.\n\nThose attitudes, the extensive news coverage and prank launchings appeared to have caused wide-spread UFO sightings, the captains wrote.\n\nStill looking, still believing\n\nIn 2015, the year before Fisher\u2019s death at the age of 81, the Dispatch interviewed him about the incident. They asked how he felt about investigators pointing out his affinity for science fiction and \u201cstrong desire to see something\u201d \u2014 the report said, for example, that Fisher \u201cwatches the sky every chance he gets.\u201d\n\nThe former officer told the Dispatch he felt investigators were fishing for statements like that. But Fisher remained \u201cadamant that he saw what he saw,\u201d even years later.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what it was, but it most certainly wasn\u2019t a balloon,\u201d the Dispatch wrote. \u201cAnd several other people saw it and were startled by it, too.\u201d\n\nPetrick also stands by his story. He said he never read the conclusions of the Air Force, but he doesn\u2019t mind skepticism. Like Fisher, he knows what he saw.\n\n\u201cPeople believe in love,\u201d Petrick said. \u201cCan you prove it? Can you prove it\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also quick to point out that his interest in the UFO comes from a place of scientific curiosity, not opportunity. It\u2019s the bird that got away.\n\nPetrick jokes about his father, whose experience with the unknown was a little different. Milton Petrick lived in rural New Jersey when Orson Welles\u2019 \u201cWar of The Worlds\u201d went over the radio the night before Halloween in 1938. Milton and his buddies saw through the radio play\u2019s facade, but took it as a chance to improve the town.\n\n\u201cThey went down with their shotguns and rifles and shot the water tower, called the police and said, \u2018Yeah, we just killed a Martian,\u2019\u201d Petrick laughs. \u201cThey got their new water tower out of it.\u201d\n\nPetrick, though, isn\u2019t looking for a new water tower. He\u2019s just looking for answers. To this day, the 66-year-old scans the western sky almost daily, longing to see the UFO again. The uncertainty, though, is a sort of gift.\n\n\u201cEverybody has beliefs that they can't prove,\u201d Petrick said. \u201cWhich is actually a good thing, or life would be boring.\u201d\n\nWhile walking around the grounds of his old elementary school on a recent fall day, Petrick\u2019s voice rattled with a certain giddiness. He shuffled his feet along the sidewalk. Every time he found the perfect spot to recreate the memory, he\u2019d find an even better one a few inches over.\n\n\u201cNow it really hits home,\u201d Petrick said, aligning a triangle between the rightmost spire on the church steeple and the roof of the school.\n\nHe lingered in the neighborhood for about a half hour, in awe of the sky. Waiting, perhaps, for an answer to appear. The weather conditions were similar to those in 1967. The sky was clear and a seasonal chill lingered in the air.\n\nFor a moment, a plane flew overhead to the north. Petrick estimated it was about the same size as the UFO of 1967. The jet left contrails behind, but they faded after a few minutes.\n\nPetrick kept on looking, raising his hand to his forehead to block out the sun \u2014 a salute, of sorts, to the puzzling sky."

        "article_content": "Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET\n\nAnthropic is expanding its Claude AI beyond the web. On Thursday, the company unveiled new desktop applications for its popular chatbot. Designed for Windows and MacOS, the new apps work similarly to the website and are available for free users and paid subscribers.\n\nTo grab the apps, head to the Claude for Desktop site, where you'll find versions for Windows, Windows on ARM, and MacOS. For now, the apps are tagged with a beta label, which may indicate that Anthropic is still tweaking them. After downloading one of the apps, you'll be prompted to sign in using a Google account or an email link. From there, use Claude just as you would use the website.\n\nAlso: How Claude's new AI data analysis tool compares to ChatGPT's version (hint: it doesn't)\n\nAsk a question. Submit a request. Start a conversation. You can ask Claude to analyze or summarize different types of files that you upload, including images, Microsoft Office files, PDFs, text files, HTML files, and code files.\n\nYou're able to access your chat history to view and resume a previous conversation. The Windows and Mac apps sync with the website and mobile apps, so you'll find the same conversation history across the board. Plus, you can view your profile settings and account and billing details.\n\nClaude is also sporting a new dictation mode. Accessible only from the Claude AI mobile apps for iOS/iPadOS and Android, the dictation feature lets you speak your request instead of typing it. This is always a handy option, especially if you don't like having to tap out lengthy prompts on a mobile device. Using dictation mode, you can carry on a real-time conversation with Claude and even respond to questions from the AI.\n\nTo try dictation, just tap the microphone icon, speak, and then tap the X button to stop. Claude displays its response on the screen. To continue the conversation, just tap the microphone icon again and dictate another question or request.\n\nLooking to challenge other AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini, Anthropic has been on a tear trying to fine-tune and expand Claude.\n\nAlso: I tested this viral AI image generator, and it does text well - finally! Try it for free\n\nThe company recently released a new model of Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Currently in beta mode for developers to use via an API, the new version can interact with a computer by looking at the screen, moving the cursor, clicking buttons, and entering text via a virtual keyboard.\n\nIn August, Anthropic kicked off a feature known as Artifacts. Available to free and paid users on the website, the mobile apps, and the new desktop apps, Artifacts can help you create a website, a page of code, a visual presentation, or another project by displaying the results in real time right next to your conversation."

I moved the UV index, humidity, sunrise/sunset, and wind conditions as high as they could go on my setup. It's a trade-off, because the Weather app's data widgets are so big as to require scrolling to get the full picture of a day, and you can't move the AI summary or 10-day forecast off the top. But if you only need a few numbers and like a verbal summary, it's handy.\n\nSadly, if you're an allergy sufferer and you're not in the UK, Germany, France, or Italy, Google can't offer you any pollen data or forecasts. There is also, I am sad to say, no frog.\n\nGoogle's Weather app isn't faring so well with Play Store reviewers. Users are miffed that they can't see a location's weather without adding it to their saved locations list; that other Google apps, including the \"At a Glance\" app on every Pixel's default launcher, send you to the Google app's summary instead of this app; the look of the weather map; and, most of all, that it does not show up in some phones' app list, but only as a widget."

They\u2019ve carried out dozens of ghost investigations in the Oshkosh area.\n\n\n\nThose in the Oshkosh Paranormal Society have had a lifelong passion for ghosts\n\nThe group measures electricity and energy to communicate with spirits.\n\nThe Oshkosh Paranormal Society hopes to help people find peace of mind with death.\n\nIngrid Lemke says her first encounter with a spirit was early in her childhood.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a preteen, I had seen a shadow figure, and it just really terrified me,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like it was hovering over me.\u201d\n\nSince the incident, Lemke says she has had a sort of \u201csixth sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in my day, they thought you were insane, so I only told my friends,\u201d she says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until her adulthood that Lemke would find a large group of like-minded people and create what is now the Oshkosh Paranormal Society.\n\nLemke says it was validating finding others with a similar connection to ghosts and spirits.\n\n\u201cIt feels wonderful, it feels freeing,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Oshkosh Paranormal Society started as a group of Lemke and her coworkers, but now is a large Facebook group.\n\nMany in the group also had paranormal experiences as children.\n\n\u201cI think I was about eight,\u201d Emily Kampmann, a member of the group, says. \u201cI kind of woke up on the floor one day in my bedroom, and I was staring at my closet\u2026. and the door was wide open and there was glowing lights, like eyeballs staring at me. I know it sounds silly.\u201d\n\nThe group gets together to do paranormal investigations in haunted areas around Oshkosh. They\u2019ve investigated the local cemetery, The Grand Oshkosh, the Algoma Club and multiple personal homes.\n\nLemke says the downtown area near the Algoma Club and the Grand Oshkosh seem to be particularly haunted, which she believes is due to Oshkosh\u2019s two 19th century fires.\n\n\u201cOur investigations are generally scientific,\u201d Lemke says.\n\nThe group relies on different types of instruments and tools to pick up on energy shifts in the air. Some of the tools are used by electricians to track electricity.\n\n\u201cSo the theory is that spirits are energy, so when they get close to that, it triggers it,\u201d Jason Tiffany, a member of the group, says.\n\nThey also use recording devices to pick up on voices they wouldn\u2019t normally hear.\n\nLemke says they find a lot of evidence after the investigation ends and they\u2019re able to rewatch the footage.\n\n\u201cIt takes many hours,\u201d Lemke says.\n\nThe Algoma Club in Oshkosh was a speakeasy during prohibition, and Lemke says they\u2019ve found lots of evidence of prohibition-era spirits roaming the space.\n\n\"It's definitely a heavy presence,\" Lilly Heft, another member of the group says of the Algoma Club. \"I feel spooky in here.\"\n\nDespite the many hours that go into each investigation, the group says they are always fun.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s an adrenaline rush, but it kind of is,\u201d Heft says.\n\nHeft says she\u2019s a \u201chardcore believer\u201d in ghosts, but that\u2019s not true for everyone in the group.\n\n\u201cIf you hear a voice, you know, understanding that, is that your brain just trying to figure out what\u2019s going on?\" Stephanie Whittaker, another member of the group says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just, well for me anyways, you can\u2019t just let your imagination run away with you.\u201d\n\nWhittaker says she\u2019s a \u201cskeptic,\u201d and often questions the evidence the group collects. Still, there are some findings that she says are hard to deny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve, with the group, had enough experiences that I can\u2019t explain,\u201d she says.\n\nMore than the thrill of finding ghosts, the Oshkosh Paranormal Society hopes to use its passion to help people.\n\n\u201cMy favorite aspect of our group is when we help people in their personal houses,\u201d Lemke says. \u201cBecause they\u2019ve felt like I did when I was a kid\u2014 who do I reach out to? Who do I trust with this? I know how that feels not having any validation.\u201d\n\nLemke says she\u2019s helped expel angry spirits from homes, as well as give people the confirmation that they\u2019re not imagining things.\n\nFor Kampmann, she thinks the group can help on a deeper level\u2014 giving comfort around death.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really neat to experiment with that and show people that there is life after death in some form, to not be like somewhat scared of death even,\u201d she says.\n\nMore information on the group can be found on their Facebook page.\n\n"

        "article_content": "SALEM, Ohio \u2014 In between the cracks of Gothic buildings and rusty swing carousels lies a dark past, one that the West Virginia Department of Tourism\u2019s Paranormal Trail seeks to uncover.\n\nLaunched on Oct. 1, the Paranormal Trail is a digital passport that rewards individuals for visiting West Virginia\u2019s reportedly most haunted locations through a tier system of prizes. In its first two weeks alone, the trail saw over 5,000 sign-ups.\n\nOn a larger scale, the trail takes visitors on a tour of the state, exposing its rich history and that not everything is as it seems.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to experience something different at everyone you go to,\u201d said Michelle Graham, filming and events manager for Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum. \u201cYou can learn so much about things that are unexplained by the people who spend so much time in these buildings.\u201d\n\nLake Shawnee\n\nBeneath the soil of Lake Shawnee abandoned amusement park lies thousands of years of history. It starts with the Native American Shawnee tribe which occupied West Virginia for nearly 2,000 years before the United States government told them to assimilate or leave in 1831.\n\nOne of the most notable Shawnee leaders was Chief Cornstalk, originally named Hokleskwa, which translates loosely to \u201cstalk of corn.\u201d He was the leader of the Shawnee nation between 1720-1777.\n\nCornstalk was murdered by American militiamen while on a diplomatic visit in November 1777, during the American Revolutionary War. His death furthered tensions between the two groups.\n\nAround the same time, the first English settlers in Mercer County, the Clay family, moved to what is now known as the Lake Shawnee property in 1775. Mitchell and Phoebe Clay had 16 children, but three of them would be massacred by the Shawnee tribe in 1783.\n\nViolent deaths continued to plague the property after Conley T. Snidow turned it into an amusement park, which opened in 1926. Six children were killed in accidents at Lake Shawnee Amusement Park between 1926 and 1967, when the park finally closed.\n\nThe park was reopened by former employee Gaylord White in 1987 but would only operate as an amusement park for two years before closing again.\n\nAt a crossroads with what to do, Gaylord and his son, Chris White, the current owner of Lake Shawnee, decided to turn the property into a mud bog in 1989 \u2014 but they would uncover something much more valuable than dirt.\n\nWhile bulldozing the empty field in 1990, they started finding arrowheads and pieces of pottery. Gaylord immediately stopped and called Marshall University archaeologists to inspect the land. The team would uncover loads of Native American artifacts between 1990-1991, as well as a Shawnee burial ground.\n\nToday, the site pays homage to the Shawnee tribe where artifacts are on display. Additionally, Chris White provides a brief history on the Shawnee tribe. Someday, he hopes to create a small Native American museum on-site.\n\nThe abandoned amusement park also honors the other deaths that occurred on site, including the Clay family and the children who died while the amusement park was in operation.\n\nOver the years, visitors have left offerings to the Native Americans or the children like handcrafted items, stuffed animals, pinwheels and various toys.\n\n\u201cWe ask anybody that comes to bring an offering, and the offering doesn\u2019t need to be valuable,\u201d Chris White said. \u201cIt\u2019s better if it means something to you.\u201d\n\n1 of 19\n\nNumerous TV shows and paranormal investigators have also visited the site to film and experience the ghosts of the park\u2019s past. Many claim the spirits of the children who died at the park remain there today.\n\nSince taking part in the Paranormal Trail, Chris White has seen an increase in visitors at Lake Shawnee. He hopes more people continue visiting Lake Shawnee and the other sites on the Paranormal trail.\n\n\u201cVistors should come to Lake Shawnee because it\u2019s unique,\u201d Chris White said. \u201cYou will learn a lot about Native American history and their culture, the way they lived and the way they died. You can walk the creepy trail (where the Clay children died) and you can go around the park and take photos of the Ferris Wheel and swings.\u201d\n\nLake Shawnee, 470 Matoaka Road, Rock, West Virginia, offers daytime tours and overnight stays by appointment only. For more information, call or text 304-921-1580, or visit www.wvlakeshawnee.com.\n\nTrans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum\n\nLurking in the halls of the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum are decades\u2019 worth of memories that are both tragic and pleasant in equal measure.\n\n\u201cWe ran the entire gamut of mental health treatment progression in the years that the asylum was in operation,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThere was a lot of dark history there, but at the same time we want to highlight and showcase that this was somebody\u2019s home. There were people who cried when the asylum closed in 1994 because they\u2019d spent their entire lives here. We have just as much good as we have bad.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum began in 1858. The facility opened in 1864, although work on it would continue until 1881. It is the largest hand-cut stone masonry building in North America and is the second largest in the world, next to the Kremlin. The asylum was originally designed to provide care for 250 patients.\n\nIn the beginning, there weren\u2019t strong criteria for admitting patients, Graham said. However, over time, the asylum would start separating the patients based on needs within the wards of the asylum including violent females, violent males, tuberculosis and more.\n\nThe oldest section of the building is the Civil War section, which housed both Union and Confederate soldiers during the early days of operations.\n\nAt its peak in the 1950s, the asylum housed 2,400 patients. Treatments ranged from lobotomies, electroshock therapy and hydrotherapy in the early years to various forms of discussion-based therapy and antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs in the later years.\n\nEventually, with the evolution of modern-day healthcare, outpatient care became more common which is one of the contributing factors for the asylums closure in 1994. The asylum reopened as a tourist attraction in March 2008.\n\nToday, the asylum acts not only as one of the most unique pieces of architecture in the world but seeks to highlight the evolution of mental health care. Graham adds that the treatments of lobotomies and electroshock therapy given prior to the 1960s are often misinterpreted as acts of vengeance.\n\n\u201cThis was not just some horror place that that they were experimenting on patients,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThey 100% believed that it was the best medical practice that was going to help the patients that resided at the asylum at the time.\u201d\n\nThe Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, 50 S River Ave., Weston, West Virginia, is part of West Virginia\u2019s Paranormal Trail and has many tours available, including the history tour, discover the asylum tour, photography tours, ghost tours and more. Reservations are required for some of the tours. For more information, visit trans-alleghenylunaticasylum.com.\n\nParanormal Trail\n\nThe trail includes 18 haunted stops across West Virginia. To join the journey, interested parties need to register to receive a link that opens up a personal digital passport.\n\nVisitors will click the check-in button, upon visiting a location, which earns them prizes the more locations they visit. At three locations, participants get a Paranormal Trail sticker, at 10 they get a Paranormal Trail beanie and by visiting all 18 they get a limited edition Paranormal Trail print designed by West Virginia artist Liz Pavlovic.\n\nThe challenge lasts until the end of the year. However, if it proves to be popular, the West Virginia Department of Tourism may extend it to next year.\n\nSites on the Paranormal Trail include:\n\nMothman Museum; Point Pleasant, West Virginia; www.mothmanmuseum.com\n\nWest Virginia Penitentiary; Moundsville, West Virginia; wvpentours.com\n\nThe Blennerhassett Hotel; Parkersburg, West Virginia; theblennerhassett.com\n\nGhost Tour of Harpers Ferry; Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; www.harpersferryghost.20m.com\n\nHotel Morgan; Morgantown, West Virginia; www.hotelmorgan.com\n\nFlatwoods Monster Museum; Sutton, West Virginia; braxtonwv.org/the-flatwoods-monster/visit-the-museum\n\nThe Old Hospital on College Hill; Williamson, West Virginia; www.collegehillhospital.com\n\nThe Historic Glen Ferris Inn; Glen Ferris, West Virginia; www.glenferrisinn.com/home-9866\n\nShepherdstown Mystery Walk; Shepherdstown, West Virginia; shepherdstownmysterywalks.com\n\nThe Haunted Haymond; Sutton, West Virginia; www.facebook.com/thehaymondhousehaunted\n\nFlinderation Tunnel, Salem, West Virginia\n\nBigfoot Statue (Elk River Trail); Ivydale, West Virginia; www.elkrivertrail.org/rail-trailheads/06\n\nWest Virginia Bigfoot Museum; Sutton, West Virginia; wvbigfootmuseum.org\n\nSilver Run Tunnel (North Bend Rail Trail); Cairo, West Virginia; wvstateparks.com/park/north-bend-rail-trail\n\nCryptid Mountain Miniature Golf; Morgantown, West Virginia; www.cryptidmountainminigolf.com\n\nHempfield Tunnel (Wheeling Heritage Trail); Wheeling, West Virginia; www.wheelingwv.gov/directory/Parks-Recreation/heritage-trail\n\nFor more information, visit wvtourism.com/west-virginia-paranormal-trail.\n\n(Liz Partsch can be reached at epartsch@farmanddairy.com or 330-337-3419.)"

        "article_content": "As India continues its rapid development and is set to become a USD 7 trillion economy by 2030, businesses face immense pressure to innovate quickly and operate more efficiently than ever before. Due to the current demand to outpace competitors and respond quickly to customers, businesses today operate in a hyper-evolving environment with the need for rapid innovation, increased agility, and real-time customer care.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhen it comes to the application development process, for many years, only two options were available to organizations: purchasing ready-made solutions off the shelf or employing skilled programmers to create solutions from scratch. This has changed with the introduction of low-code/no-code (LCNC) development platforms that have revolutionized how businesses develop applications by making the process easy and more available to a wider section of the workforce These platforms can lead to cost reductions of up to 70% compared to traditional application development methods. In fact, a recent survey from Gartner indicates that by 2025, 87% of new applications developed by enterprises will use low-code or no-code technologies.\n\nLCNC platforms have changed the traditional development approach that could only be implemented by technical users. Now, both technical and non-technical users are able to make applications without additional coding knowledge. So, these platforms allow citizen developers to rise and become leaders in their business processes and workflows. These platforms empower \"citizen developers\" not only to adopt new techniques and strategies but also to get involved in the whole process of application development.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nUnderstanding Low-Code/No-Code Platforms\n\nFirst of all, both low-code and no-code platforms are programming customization techniques for a high level of expertise in IT, and these two differ in the extent of expertise in information technology required. Low-code development platforms offer a more user-friendly coding experience, which means that a partial amount of programming skill will be required. Thus, the developers are free to do their part of coding as well as to create applications in a personalized manner that meets the unique requirements of the user's business. On the flip side, no-code platforms are completely free from coding as they support those with no technical skills to design applications. Beyond this, businesses can also develop applications using the drag-and-drop method without employing any programmers.\n\nLCNC platforms are designed to make application development faster and more efficient. Whether automating workflows, streamlining processes, or improving customer experiences, LCNC platforms provide the flexibility and speed businesses need to stay competitive. The growing adoption of LCNC platforms has led to impressive market growth. According to Forrester, the combined low-code and digital process automation (DPA) market reached $13.2 billion by the end of 2023, with a projected growth rate of 21% since 2019. This surge is driven largely by the institutionalization of low-code in IT, with 87% of enterprise developers now using low-code platforms for some development work. Furthermore, Forrester predicts this growth to continue, with the market potentially reaching $30 billion by 2028, driven by the increasing adoption of citizen development strategies.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nFuture Growth Potential\n\nWith the rise of generative AI market growth at an annual rate of 36% according to Forrester, LCNC platforms, being inherently flexible and AI-compatible, are poised to benefit from this trend. A similar AI-driven explosion in citizen development could push the LCNC and DPA market to $50 billion by 2028. However, a shift toward high-code methods due to AI-infused development platforms might slow LCNC growth, aligning it with the broader software market's 11% annual growth rate.\n\nThe Rise of Citizen Developers\n\nAdvertisment\n\nOne of the most significant impact of LCNC platforms is the rise of citizen developers\u2014non-technical users who now actively participate in application development. These individuals, often business process owners, possess deep knowledge of their domain but lack formal coding expertise. With LCNC tools, they can develop applications that address their unique challenges, driving innovation within their departments.\n\nThousands of companies are using low-code platforms to develop business-critical solutions. As businesses mature, however, some may encounter nonstandard practices that basic low-code platforms can't address. Borrowing development practices from core development, such as unit testing or build quality control, can help improve a solution\u2019s quality and reduce team effort.\n\nApplications Across Industries\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe versatility of LCNC platforms has led to their adoption across a wide range of industries. For instance, in supply chain management, businesses can develop applications to enhance visibility, traceability, and efficiency. In manufacturing, LCNC tools are powering smart factories by integrating IoT networks and automating workflows.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nIn finance and accounting, LCNC platforms enable businesses to automate complex tasks such as loan approvals and risk assessments. Human resources teams are using them to streamline hiring processes and develop training programs, while even IT departments benefit from faster application development and increased agility.\n\nLCNC platforms play a significant role in business process automation (BPA), complementing robotic process automation (RPA) solutions. RPA bots can follow rules set by citizen developers, reducing bottlenecks and increasing efficiency.\n\nLow-code visual software development is a powerful solution for modernizing legacy systems at reduced cost and with minimal risk. Low-code platforms provide developers with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface through which they find it easier to accelerate their software development and minimize inefficiencies accompanied by security vulnerabilities typical for traditional systems. In general, legacy applications, including ERP systems, happen to be quite cumbersome to update and not cost-effective.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHowever, low-code platforms enable organizations to modernize such systems by integrating cloud-based innovations and extending them with modern web and mobile interfaces without the need to undertake costly customized development. It also helps in the gradual phasing out of existing obsolete applications without causing a jolt.\n\nAn important feature of low-code platforms is the democratization of software development, wherein the complexity of coding work is abstracted into more user-friendly and visual interfaces. This enables the possibility of collaboration among developers with varying skill levels, accelerates time-to-market, and reduces the risk of error. In addition, the built-in security and compliance features ensure that applications are better designed and show adherence to specific industry standards, which enhances the resilience of digital infrastructure.\n\nSuch low-code platforms offer pre-built connectors and APIs that connect easily to legacy systems for easy access to data and, thus, even modernization becomes a simplified exercise. Organizations can unlock actual new opportunities for innovation by embracing low-code development, thus propelling business growth in this fast-paced digital landscape."

He\u2019ll be matched against Will Anderson Jr., one of the league\u2019s most exciting pass-rushers, totaling 7.5 this season.\n\nI like his chances to notch another sack on Thursday (-110 on Fanatics). Anderson\u2018s athleticism and the Texans\u2019 aggressive pass rush should put pressure on Rodgers and create opportunities for the star defensive end to make a big play."

These 20 companies were selected as the best of the Startup Battlefield 200 and competed for a chance to take home the Startup Battlefield Cup and $100,000. After three days of intense pitching, we have a winner.\n\nThe startups taking part in the Startup Battlefield had all been hand-picked to participate in our startup competition. All the companies presented a live demo in front of multiple groups of VCs and tech leaders serving as judges for a chance to win $100,000 and the coveted Disrupt Cup.\n\nAfter hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges\u2019 notes and narrowed the list down to five finalists: Gecko Materials, Luna, MabLab, Salva Health, and Stitch3D.\n\nThese startups made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included Navin Chaddha (Mayfield), Chris Farmer (SignalFire), Dayna Grayson (Construct Capital), Ann Miura-Ko (Floodgate), and Hans Tung (Notable Capital).\n\nWe\u2019re now ready to announce that the winner of TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 2024 is . . .\n\nWinner: Salva Health\n\nSix years ago, while researching for a college entrepreneurship competition, Valentina Agudelo identified a troubling gap in breast cancer survival rates between Latin America and the developed world, with women in her native Colombia and the rest of the continent dying at higher rates due to late detection. She realized that breast cancer is highly treatable when diagnosed early, yet many Latin American countries have large rural populations lacking access to mammograms and other diagnostic tools. So Agudelo and her two best friends decided to create Salva Health, a theoretical portable device that would detect breast cancer early.\n\nRead more about Salva Health in our separate post.\n\nRunner-up: Gecko Materials\n\nIt looks fake, or at least like a good illusion: There\u2019s Gecko Materials founder Capella Kerst dangling a full wine bottle from her pinky finger, the only thing keeping it from smashing to pieces being the super-strong dry-adhesive her startup has brought to market. But it\u2019s no trick. It\u2019s the result of years of academic research that Kerst built on by inventing a method to mass-manufacture the adhesive. Inspired by the way real-life geckos\u2019 feet grip surfaces, the adhesive is like a new Velcro \u2014 except it only needs one side, leaves no residue, and can detach as quickly as it attaches. It can do this at least 120,000 times and, as Kerst noted in a recent interview with TechCrunch, can stay attached for seconds, minutes, or even years.\n\nRead more about Gecko Materials in our separate post.\n\nThese two companies follow in the footsteps of Startup Battlefield legends like Dropbox, Discord, Cloudflare, and Mint on the Disrupt stage. With more than 1,500 alumni having participated in the program, Startup Battlefield Alumni have collectively raised over $29 billion in funding with more than 200 successful exits."
