        "article_content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images\n\nBrilliant, eccentric German guitar hero Michael Schenker debuted with the Scorpions before joining UFO in 1974, then breaking out on his own with The Michael Schenker Group. He favours a black and white Flying V and helped popularise cocked-wah guitar tone. His new album is an all-star celebration of his UFO days, featuring Slash, Axl Rose and other heavy friends.\n\nWhat guitar did you learn on?\n\n\u201cIt was a guitar that was lying around. It must have been an acoustic. My brother Rudolf [Scorpions guitarist] got a Gibson for his birthday instead of a motorbike. It must have been that one that I secretly played against his will!\n\n\u201cThe first song I played was something to do with San Francisco. It was a hit in those days. [Hums San Francisco by The Mamas And The Papas] Yeah! And there was a solo in there, and I learnt that. I was nine years old and I was very happy.\u201d\n\nWas was there a moment when you felt you had arrived as a player?\n\n\u201cNo, it has always been the same for me. Right from the moment when I was nine years old and picked up a guitar, I was always amazed with what I could discover, and it never stopped. I am in the same place!\n\nHow much did you practise in those early days and how often do you practise now?\n\n\u201cIt is more like play and discover. That\u2019s different. It is less technical. It is more like looking for gold, and once in a while I find a piece of gold. This will automatically become part of my developed style.\u201d\n\nWhat you do with the guitar expresses your personality\n\nWhat is the one song or performance that you\u2019re most proud of?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with everything. For me, it is never about a song. I am a lead guitarist! Ha! Lead guitarists think differently. My whole life has always been about development, so every moment is special, and every moment is different. We can never compare any of them.\"\n\nWhat was your biggest motivation as a player?\n\n\u201cI wanted to express myself. That was my devotion. It still is and I have done it for 50 years, without listening to music so I don\u2019t get influenced, and that\u2019s where the uniqueness comes from. Focus on opening up what\u2019s unique about yourself. Anybody who makes that decision can do it. I am a musical monk or something. That\u2019s my mission. Self-expression is my mission.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want, in every sense, not just music. I just love to self-express and really do what I like to do. I am just in a place where I choose to do it this way instead of copying anyone else. What you do with the guitar expresses your personality.\u201d\n\nWhat technique did you have to work hardest to master?\n\n\u201cThere is no technique for me. Technique is very, very much in the background. The important thing was to find the note. I felt like I knew it was there, somewhere, and I have to find it! And the last thing on my mind was if I do it the right way or the wrong way, as long as I found that note.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, that\u2019s what I did. Day after day after day, I basically developed \u2013 technically \u2013 the wrong way of playing compared to today where you have the guitar schools, where you learn the perfect position of the hand, how to hold your fingers and play with all five fingers. But I couldn\u2019t have found my notes. I couldn\u2019t have written the songs I wrote if I would have followed that first. I just didn\u2019t care if I did it the right or wrong way.\u201d\n\nAs a player, do you have any bad habits?\n\nThere are no bad habits! There is only one thing: to make good music however you do it.\n\n\u201cThere are no bad habits! There is only one thing: to make good music however you do it. Hey, there is no right or wrong for me. I can get better technically because I have plenty of time to get my fingers into easier positions, but the thing is, there are certain ways of playing, like my style, that you cannot necessarily get across if I play it perfectly positioned with my fingers based on what\u2019s taught at guitar schools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like fishing. How you find the note, how you strike or sweep over the strings, how you hit them, that is how the sound comes together. It\u2019s not technical. Technicality makes everything clinical.\n\n\u201cBut fishing for notes as a priority makes everything three dimensional, analogue. It gives it warmth. It\u2019s not perfect \u2013 it\u2019s feeling. It\u2019s more feeling than having the right position of your fingers playing guitar.\u201d\n\nMichael Schenker wears a black felt hat and lets out a scream as he plays his black and white Dean V onstage in London.\n\nIn your early days, what guitar was the game changer for you?\n\n\u201cA triangle guitar! Yeah, very strange. I had never seen a Flying V, but when I was at school, doing this project, building something out of wood, I wanted to make a guitar and ended up building a triangle guitar, which is similar to a Flying V, but it\u2019s not the Flying V.\n\n\u201cYou put a Flying V next to a Les Paul, next to a Strat, on the floor, it won\u2019t do anything. It becomes something with the person who picks up the guitar. That\u2019s what that guitar becomes. I found the Flying V by coincidence. Like many things in my life, it happened by itself. So maybe I was meant to have that guitar.\n\n\u201cI discovered that guitar by accident. I liked the combination of my amplifier with that guitar. It was closer to the sound I imagined, and I found that I was able to do a really good vibrato by putting the V between my legs, so that the neck would not wobble around. I was able to lock it in and so that was one of the main reasons why I felt good about that guitar.\u201d\n\nWith your new album of classic UFO material, was there anything you learned about your playing when revisiting songs you wrote 50 years ago?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t analyse things. I just do it. I don\u2019t analyse what I have done, or why I did it, I just do it because that is the moment of being an artist. You just do it. Less thought!\u201d\n\nWhat do you play when you\u2019re just relaxing and playing for fun?\n\n\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t think. I just pick up the guitar and play. But one thing I do in order to keep shape is I play to a metronome to make sure I am not slowing down in any way, because when you get older the way we perceive time is different from when we are younger, so sometimes you think you are playing as fast as you did the day before but it is do with the biological rhythm. I always measure by a metronome, at a certain speed. I have to make sure that I can play my old songs.\u201d\n\nDo you have any favourite tracks from revisiting your UFO years?\n\n\u201cI love This Kid\u2019s with Biff [Byford, Saxon frontman]. I was amazed. I always wanted to do something with Biff. Every song is different but everybody did a great version. I don\u2019t like comparing things. I just like to listen to it and not compare it like the Olympics! There are so many different qualities, different feelings, but all of them are unique in their own way, so I don\u2019t give them points for their performances.\n\nOne thing I do in order to keep shape is I play to a metronome to make sure I am not slowing down in any way, because when you get older the way we perceive time is different from when we are younger\n\n\u201cIt is all great stuff, what they did. When I heard Dee Snider [ex-Twisted Sister singer] I went, \u2018Wow!\u2019 I didn\u2019t know he had a great voice like this. Kai Hansen [Helloween guitarist/vocalist] was another one. He did a fantastic job on Rock Bottom. And when I heard Joel Hoekstra, he sounds like a saxophone on his guitar. He\u2019s really, really unique. It was fun. It still is fun listening to the different approaches. I didn\u2019t expect anything, but when I heard it I was extremely happy with it.\u201d\n\nAnd Axl Rose?\n\n\u201cAxl originally sang three songs, but he didn\u2019t like his versions of Only You Can Rock Me and Too Hot To Handle, so he decided to stick with Love To Love, which is a fantastic version.\n\nCan you recall a moment when you felt like you\u2019d failed as a player or felt embarrassed by a performance?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big question. Of course you can feel embarrassed when you play a bum note. But I don\u2019t really focus on that. I\u2019d rather focus on the good moments. You know, I played bum notes on Strangers In The Night [UFO\u2019s legendary 1979 live album], and today those bum notes are the right notes! Because everybody got used to it.\n\n\u201cAnd people ask me, \u2018Michael, how do you make this work, playing a major over a minor?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u2019 But they might have been asking about those bum notes!\u201d\n\nMy Years With UFO is out now via EarMUSIC."

This means processing power is not solely concentrated in massive data centres. It is increasingly moving to the edge of the network: your laptop, in this case,\u201d says Mr Derek Chen, vice-president of Global Business and Marketing of Taiwanese computer maker MSI.\n\nWith AI, personal computers like laptops have evolved from being useful tools for work and play into smart assistants capable of boosting productivity, enhancing gaming experiences and unlocking creativity.\n\nHaving an AI-powered edge\n\nAI laptops are not your typical computers. Built to handle AI tasks efficiently, all of MSI\u2019s AI laptops come with a neural processing unit (NPU), a specialised chip dedicated solely to managing AI processes.\n\nWhile standard computers can run AI applications, they lack an NPU. This means that the computer\u2019s central processing unit (CPU) must juggle both routine computing tasks and AI ones. This can overload the system and lead to slower performance.\n\nOn AI laptops, the addition of an NPU works very much like giving the computer a \u201csecond brain\u201d. With the NPU dedicated to processing AI functions, the CPU is free to focus on everyday computing tasks.\n\nThanks to this \u201cdual brain\u201d setup, AI laptops can deliver complex AI functions quickly while giving users a faster and smoother computing experience at the same time."

Guests and staff have seen figures on the mezzanine above the lobby, also sitting in the LB Tavern.\n\n\"[People] mention the fact they're dressed out of fashion, period inappropriate clothing,\" said Vince Wilson, the hotel's entertainment producer. \"They'll point back over and those customers will disappear into nothing.\"\n\nWilson leads ghost tours at the hotel, as does the Mystical TeAnna, who co-owns the hotel's Poe's Magic Theatre.\n\nThey led Valera and Sellgren on a personal tour of some of the hotel's hotspots.\n\nOne of them was the Versailles room, a ballroom at the hotel. People have seen crystals on the chandeliers sway slightly back and forth, according to Wilson.\n\nPeople have also seen a couple dancing and they're believed to be the parents of Molly.\n\nWho is Molly?\n\nMolly is a spirit said to roam the hotel's halls. A painting of her hangs on the 19th floor, which is considered to be the hotel's most active floor.\n\nNo one has ever really seen her face, but people who have seen her say they've seen her dress or her shoes.\n\nShe's most notably known for playing with her ball.\n\nMore than 20 people are confirmed to have died by suicide by jumping off the 19th floor back when the stock market crashed, triggering the Great Depression.\n\nIt's not clear if Molly is one of those who died that way.\n\nTalking with Molly\n\nWith the help of Wilson, Valera attempted to talk with Molly twice at the hotel.\n\nFirst in the Maryland Room in the hotel's lower level. Wilson used a spirit bell, which to the naked eye looks like glass held up by a string.\n\nWilson said it's a method that originated in the 19th century. It's believed spirits will communicate with the living by \"pinging\" the glass with the string.\n\nValera first asked, \"Molly, are you here with us?\"\n\nAlmost immediately after, a loud ping was heard. Wilson said that was a resounding yes.\n\nValera also asked if Molly had her ball with her, and if it was OK that he was there with her. Both got a ping in response.\n\nThe group then took it to modern-day communication with an electromagnetic field detector, or an EMF meter.\n\nOriginally, [an EMF meter] was used for scientific measurements,\" Wilson said. \"Modern-day ghost hunters, or technospiritualists, have repurposed it for ghost hunting.\"\n\nTaking it to the 19th floor, Valera tried talking to Molly again. While there were moments when the device went off, there was no confirmation he was talking to Molly.\n\nHaunted or not haunted?\n\nWhen they called it a night, Valera and Sellgren set up an overnight camera in their rooms to see if they'd catch anything while they were sleeping.\n\nNeither camera caught anything of note. It's hard to definitively say if anything experienced at the hotel during Valera and Sellgren's stay was paranormal.\n\nBut, whether you're a believer or not, reflections of the hotel's past can't be ignored.\n\nFirst built in 1929, much of the hotel's decor and style now still looks very much like it was nearly 100 years ago.\n\nWilson said that can create a spooky feel of its own.\n\n\"Their memories are embedded in the walls of this hotel,\" he said.\n\nAs long as the stories live on, so does the paranormal -- the paranormal reputation, that is.\n\n\"I'm certain there are people who won't go to a haunted hotel,\" Wilson said. \"But I think the people that will far outnumber that.\""

Since then, they\u2019ve helped launch films like Insidious, Whiplash, Get Out, Sinister, The Purge, and this year\u2019s Speak No Evil.\n\nWith a new year comes a new BlumFest, a panel where CEO Jason Blum brings in a few of the creative minds behind Blumhouse\u2019s upcoming horror films to give us a sneak peek at what\u2019s to come. But first, we had to catch up with the company\u2019s founder, who has been producing these films since the turn of the 21st century.\n\nAlthough Blum is now one of the most respected names in horror, he recalled a time when he needed to fight to get one movie made. \u201cParanormal Activity,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNo one returned my calls for three years. I had no clout. Now, if I say a movie\u2019s good, no one will buy it, but at least they\u2019ll watch it. When I did Paranormal Activity, they wouldn\u2019t even watch the movie. For three years, I tried, I begged people to watch the film. They would not see the film. I had to sell the remake rights to get people to actually watch the film in front of an audience. That\u2019s why I never turned back. I only made horror movies ever since then because that moment was so such a big moment in my life.\u201d\n\nBlumhouse will learn from disappointments\n\nParanormal Activity grossed $194.2 million worldwide against a $15,000 production budget, with critics praising the film. Although he\u2019s had his fair share of critical successes, like M3GAN and The Black Phone, some movies have missed the mark. This year, critics were less kind to films like Night Swim, Imaginary, and Afraid, and Blum had candid words for whenever his movies don\u2019t perform as well as he hoped.\n\n\u201cI get very sad about it,\u201d Blum said. \u201cI take it very personally. I get very emotional about it. I always believe in our children, so when they don\u2019t work, or the audience doesn\u2019t like them, I take it very personally. I debrief. Then I have a big moment in the company after it happens where I say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t this movie work?\u2019 I don\u2019t pretend that it worked or say, \u2018Well, we almost got a single\u2019 or whatever. I say, \u2018This movie did not work. Why not? And how do we not repeat the same mistakes?\u2019 So the first is sadness, then learning. And then you gotta dust off your pants. You gotta get in there again and get excited again. If you start moping around, it\u2019s not fun to work there. So I go through those three phases. Every time I allow myself to be sad, then I allow myself to learn, and then I allow myself to move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gotta think about this next one and try not to repeat the same mistakes,\u201d he says, exemplifying his CEO mentality. \u201cBut it\u2019s the worst part about the business. People say, \u2018do you want to retire?\u2019 I say, \u2018When things are not going well, I wanna retire. And when things are going great, I want to work forever.'\u201d\n\nJason Blum addresses AI backlash\n\nBlum then commented on Blumhouse\u2019s recent partnership with Meta Movie Gen, which Deadline described as \u201ca suite of AI models that show how you can use simple text inputs to produce custom videos and sounds, edit existing videos, and transform a personal image into a unique video.\u201d This announcement comes when AI is looming large over the entertainment industry, leading to mixed reactions as some audience members are concerned that AI-generated art can take away opportunities from creative professionals.\n\n\u201cWe had a ton of negative press around that and a ton of negative reaction,\u201d Blum admits. \u201cMy point of view is we are a company that enables artists. Artists always come first, and artists want tools. And to me, it would be irresponsible if we didn\u2019t at least know about the tools. And I think also for me, it would be irresponsible to not learn about the tools. So I know nothing about AI, but I wanted to do this to learn. So, we worked with three filmmakers to make these little shorts so that we could learn about it. So when a filmmaker asks me about AI and \u2018Can I do effects with AI, or what can I do or what can\u2019t I do,\u2019 I at least want to be able to have a reasonable answer before I bury my head in the sand, and that was why I did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have a feeling one way or another generally about AI,\u201d Blum says. \u201cI think it\u2019s 50% good and 50% horrible. But I wanna understand because one thing for sure, it\u2019s here to stay. So I wanna understand it, and I don\u2019t understand it yet, and I need to understand it. And this is one of the ways that I\u2019m trying to understand it.\u201d\n\nWhat to expect from M3GAN 2.0\n\nPerhaps one way Blum has been trying to understand AI is by incorporating it into his horror films. One recent example is the 2023 film M3GAN, a movie about an AI-powered killer doll that received rave reviews and earned $181 million worldwide against a $12 million budget. This movie was such a massive success that it has spawned a planned sequel, M3GAN 2.0, and a planned spin-off, SOULM8TE. Actress Allison Williams, known for her memorable roles in Get Out and the first M3GAN, stopped by New York Comic Con to share whatever she could about the upcoming film.\n\n\u201cThe effects of the first movie are very clear on Gemma as the second movie starts, and I think that\u2019s kind of all I can say is that it\u2019s very clear that she lived through the things that we saw her live through in the first movie, and she has adjusted life accordingly,\u201d Williams said. She hopes audiences respond to the sequel with \u201centhusiasm\u201d and shared her thoughts on portraying the uniquely campy tone that the first film had.\n\n\u201cIn this franchise, my job is kind of playing it very straight and keeping it kind of real so that the audience can kind of relate to my experience,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAlthough, there are other characters who are also the cipher for the audience occasionally. Yeah, it\u2019s playing it straight, but also, when you\u2019re in the horror genre, you have to have big reactions to things, and the stakes are really high, and everything\u2019s heightened. And so it\u2019s also a game of pushing yourself to an 11, and then with me, that\u2019s still gonna be kind of grounded. Like, I don\u2019t really have that really big performance that I like to do in these movies. So yeah, it\u2019s kind of a dance in that way.\u201d\n\nAlthough she has starred in two famous horror movies, Williams needs the perfect conditions to watch horror movies on her own. \u201cIt really takes it out of me. I have to really prepare myself. It has to be day; it has to be on a plane,\u201d she says. Looking beyond the horror genre, Williams shared what else she wanted to do with her career. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be on a horse in a corset with a candle. Like, I wanna go way back in time. Like deep historical fiction, maybe.\u201d\n\nDrop reunites Christopher Landon & Blumhouse\n\nAlso on Blumhouse\u2019s theatrical slate next year is Drop, a horror film about a woman played by Meghann Fahy, who goes on a date and suddenly finds herself getting AirDropped creepy memes. She soon finds that her family is being held hostage by a killer who forces her into a high-stakes game of life and death. This film is directed by Christopher Landon, who previously helmed Happy Death Day and Freaky for Blumhouse, along with writing most of the Paranormal Activity movies.\n\n\u201cIt sort of fits in the classic thriller realm, which I think is very exciting and it\u2019s super fast paced,\u201d says Fahy. \u201cDefinitely will keep you on the edge of your seat. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s intense, fast,\u201d says Landon. \u201cYou know what it is. It\u2019s like Hitchcock had a baby with a nineties thriller and modern technology. That\u2019s the vibe\u2026it\u2019s everyday technology that we all use and deal with and I think that\u2019s what makes the movie so scary because you see how that type of technology can be weaponized and used against someone. Tone-wise, it\u2019s definitely a departure. I think for me, or I was saying earlier, a bit of a return to my sort of old Disturbia days if anyone even knows that reference. I mean I think it\u2019s decidedly more serious in tone, but I also think that there\u2019s still room for humor. Yeah. I think that still shines, definitely.\u201d\n\nLandon also shared an update on the long-awaited Happy Death Day sequel that has been discussed but has not been given the green light. \u201cYou are talking to the wrong guy,\u201d he jokes when asked about Happy Death Day 3. \u201cThe guy who has no power, who has no control over anything in his life or outside of it. I would do it in a heartbeat, but it\u2019s a Jason Blum/Universal [decision]. It\u2019s up to the people with the money.\u201d\n\nWolf Man hopes to scare audiences\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest debuts at BlumFest was the new trailer for Wolf Man, an upcoming Universal Monsters movie directed by Leigh Whannell, who previously directed films like Insidious: Chapter 3, Upgrade, and The Invisible Man. This upcoming movie has had a long development period, with Whannell being attached at first and then leaving the project. At one point, the film was going to be a joint venture between Ryan Gosling and Derek Cianfrance, who had previously collaborated on Blue Valentine and The Place Beyond the Pines. However, they left the project, and Whannell returned as co-writer and director.\n\n\u201cMy idea for the Wolf Man didn\u2019t really change much,\u201d Whannell recalls. \u201cMy initial concept, like, I remember pacing around in my backyard thinking like, \u2018all right, what am I gonna do with this movie? If I\u2019m doing this, what am I doing?\u2019 And there was this light bulb moment of like, \u2018oh, it\u2019s this.\u2019 And I talked about it with my wife, Corbett. We ended up co-writing the film together. She was excited, like she loves horror movies, but she\u2019s usually a pretty good critic of my ideas. She\u2019ll be like, \u2018ah, what about, you know,\u2019 which is good. With this one, she was like, \u2018oh, I love that.\u2019 And then she ended up co-writing it with me. So then it went through various writers. I stepped off the project, then I came back onto it. And even though it changed, eventually when it got back to me, I stuck with that same idea that I\u2019d had in the backyard. It never really wavered from that initial idea.\u201d\n\nWhannell hopes that audiences will connect with the film. \u201cI hope that they love it,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope they\u2019re scared. I hope that they\u2019re emotional about it. So, I want it to be a tragedy. I want it to be emotional. I also want it to scare the shit out of them. You know, I want people to see it in theaters. I mean, that\u2019s the eternal question these days is how do you get people into theaters? You know, how do you turn something into a phenomenon? You know, like, it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough to make a Top Gun or a Barbie, you know, these, these movies that really get moviegoers into theaters. It\u2019s getting to be a smaller target than ever. So I really hope Wolf Man connects on that level.\u201d\n\nWolf Man is his second Universal Monsters movie after The Invisible Man in 2020. When asked if he\u2019d make any more Universal Monster films, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. You know what, at the moment, no, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m not interested; it\u2019s just that a lot of times, you just have to let the movie find you. Because I write my own films, it takes a long time for me to get into that zone of like, \u2018yes, I\u2019m excited about this.\u2019 You know, I can\u2019t lie to myself as a writer, and I\u2019m not relying on other writers to come up with the idea for me. So I\u2019m starting back at zero every time. And so that\u2019s kind of where I am now. I\u2019m just thinking about the things that interest me. What would I wanna see in a theater? And I\u2019m thinking a lot about what works in a theater. That\u2019s not something I used to think about 10-15 years ago. I just took it for granted that if you made a film, it would get a theatrical release. Yeah. Now, in 2024-2025, I have to actually sit down and think about what plays in a theater. You know, otherwise, I think if you don\u2019t build that into the screenplay, you\u2019re in danger of just being a streaming movie, which is fine, but it\u2019s not what I wanna do right now.\u201d\n\nWhannel reflects on Saw\u2019s legacy\n\nThis month also marks an anniversary for Whannell. October 29, 2024, marks the 20-year anniversary of the 2004 movie Saw. Whannell was a writer on the first three Saw movies and starred as Adam, the protagonist of the original film. He reflected on the long-standing legacy of the first film\u2019s shocking ending.\n\n\u201cYou know when I wrote that first Saw movie, and I was working in conjunction with James Wan, we were back in Australia, [and] both of us knew we had something special,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNow, we didn\u2019t necessarily know it was gonna be some big box office success, but we knew that anyone who saw it would react. There\u2019s no better feeling in the world to be like, \u2018oh, I\u2019m sitting on top of something right now. I have a secret.\u2019 And when I was writing the ending, it was just flowing outta my fingers. \u2018Cause I was like, \u2018this is gonna work.\u2019 Seeing that ending affect people was one of the most satisfying things I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life, especially in a movie theater. Of all the films I\u2019ve been involved in. Watching the ending of Saw with an audience was the craziest thing ever. I could get goosebumps now just thinking about it.\u201d\n\nWhannell left the series as a creative force after Saw III, only retaining an executive producer credit on the subsequent sequels. He reflected on the franchise that Saw has become, saying, \u201cFor me, I am not such a fan of the latest Saw movies. It\u2019s not that I think they\u2019re bad movies, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve separated myself from that. Like, I feel like they should have ended it with the third movie, you know? But having said that, it\u2019s one of those things. A reality of Hollywood is that when someone owns that IP, they can keep doing it. They do it. It\u2019s not really up to you anymore. Also, I meet these Saw fans, and they love Saw V or VI or VII. You know, so I don\u2019t wanna take anything away from them. So I\u2019m happy that it continues over there. And then I\u2019ve got this other life over here, where I\u2019m making my own movies. And what\u2019s great now is people will come up to me and talk about movies I\u2019ve directed. They\u2019ll say like, I love Upgrade, or I love Invisible Man. And I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, wow. I\u2019m experiencing this second life as a director.\u2019 So I\u2019m just really happy about that. You know, it means I\u2019m more comfortable to let Saw be a thing over there now that I\u2019ve got my own thing going.\u201d\n\nThe post BlumFest 2024: Blumhouse Creatives Tease 2025 Horror Movies, Talk AI, & More appeared first on ComingSoon.net - Movie Trailers, TV & Streaming News, and More."

        "article_content": "The Fenton History Center is helping community members get into the Halloween spirit with two Halloween Spirit Tours set for Oct 26.\n\nThe tours are presented and run by Kaycee Colburn, a Fenton board member, artist, paranormal investigator and spiritual intuitive. Colburn comes from a background of working with the paranormal community, including at places such as the Dunkirk Lighthouse, other similar museums to the Fenton, and recreational locations such as the Haunted Hinsdale House.\n\nThe first tour will take place from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Fenton, 67 Washington Street. The cost for the first tour is $30 for members and $35 for non-members. The second tour is a special Halloween tour from 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. for adults 18 and up. The cost for the second tour is $40 for members and $45 for non-members. Additionally, guests are encouraged to come in costume for the second tour, which Colburn said helps to bring people into a different mindset.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring the paranormal vibe to the area, see if we can trigger any spirits and enhance the experience for the guests,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cWe don\u2019t say the Fenton is haunted, we leave that up to the guests and hope to give them a fun experience.\u201d\n\nColburn said the paranormal is something that is very popular these days and the tour can help give people insights into what they might see on television, along with allowing them to choose for themselves if the paranormal is or is not for them. She added that the tour is good for this time of year when the paranormal is already popular and people are looking for Halloween related things to do.\n\n\u201cPeople are already interested in the Fenton on its own and now they can come in the dark and see it in a different light, which gives a cool Halloween feeling,\u201d Colburn said.\n\nColburn encouraged participants to bring a flashlight, dress warmly, and be open minded, saying that there are a lot of theories surrounding the paranormal and that it is not for everyone. She said the tours are for people to come have fun and are very educational about the paranormal.\n\nThe Fenton has done other Spirit Tours throughout the year, and Colburn thought it was something that could possibly be done again next year after having received good responses this year to previous tours. She said some participants have requested the tours be longer or be overnight, which is something she said they are not currently able to do, but that overall there has been a positive response.\n\n\u201cIt gets people out of the house,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else quite like it locally.\u201d\n\nThe Spirit Tours are set to offer a safe Halloween, family friendly, fun event to let people learn more about the paranormal and spiritualist movement. Colburn said the tours are a way to bring information in and discuss the paranormal where in today\u2019s society that cannot always happen as it is labeled as creepy.\n\n\u201cThere was a time where the paranormal was not seen as creepy, including right here in Jamestown,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cSo being able to talk about it this way is cool.\u201d\n\nRegistration for both Oct 26 Spirit Tours is available on the Fenton History Center\u2019s website, fentonhistorycenter.org, under the events tab."

        "date": "6h",
        "source": "The Conversation",
        "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2013 including the Nobel committees \u2013 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI\u2019s potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \u201cone of the most transformative technologies in human history\u201d. But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2013 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \u201cillusion of explanatory depth\u201d. Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \u201cillusion of exploratory breadth\u201d. Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nFinally, the \u201cillusion of objectivity\u201d. Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI\u2019s increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \u201cAI Scientist\u201d machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company\u2019s vision is to develop a \u201cfully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\u201d, where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2013 though critics said the system produced \u201cendless scientific slop\u201d.\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \u201caccelerate\u201d the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value, further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can\u2019t take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \u201ctrust the science\u201d can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritises the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2013 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalise the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \u201coutsourcing\u201d that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI? And how can researchers remain aligned with society\u2019s expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt\u2019s time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2013 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

        "article_content": "Nilpena Ediacara National Park in South Australia is well known for its collection of fossils from the Ediacaran period\u2014a geologic timespan that predates the Cambrian explosion.\n\nAn international team of researchers discovered a new specimen called Quaestio simpsonorum\u2014a pancake-shaped creature that represents on of the earliest examples of complex life on Earth.\n\nThis discovery provides more insight into how animals evolved from single-celled organisms and shows that there\u2019s more to be discovered at this world-famous fossil bed.\n\nAcross the vast expanse of Earth\u2019s 4.6-billion-year-long history, life has taken many forms. With the first microbes likely appearing a good billion years following the planet\u2019s initial formation, the history of life is filled with long periods of seemingly unchanging stability punctuated by moments of immense destruction or practically exponential growth. One of the best known examples of that latter phenomenon is the Cambrian Explosion\u2014the geologic period some 530 million years ago when Earth saw an immense uptick in the complexity of life in its oceans.\n\nHowever, complex life was well underway even before this \u201cexplosion,\u201d and nowhere can this be seen more clearly than at the 150,000-acre Nilpena Ediacara National Park in South Australia. Located on the western fringe of the Flinders Range\u2014the largest mountain range in the Australian state\u2014this national park (as its name suggests) contains the richest collection of fossil specimens from the Ediacaran period (a 96 million-year-long geologic span that follows the Cryogenian period and is known to some as \u201cSnowball Earth\u201d) and the aforementioned Cambrian period. Since this fossil bed\u2019s discovery in 1946, paleontologists have uncovered 40 species embedded in the rock of what was once an ancient seafloor.\n\nRelated Story A New Study Unravels a Major Microfossil Mystery\n\nNow, an international team of scientists lead by Scott Evans\u2014assistant professor of geology at Florida State University\u2014has uncovered what could be one of the earliest (and strangest) forms of animal life to date at the site. Called Quaestio simpsonorum (pronounced kways-tee-oh), this ancient marine animal likely lived around 555 million years ago, and looked like a flattened pancake with a question mark shape in the middle of its body.\n\nWhile that\u2019s puzzling in itself, the more shocking piece of this discovery is evidence that Q. simpsonorum could move on its own\u2014it would have shifted around sort of like a robotic vacuum cleaner, slowly hoovering up all kinds of microscopic algae and bacteria. The results of this study were published in the journal Evolution & Development .\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t other fossils from this time that have shown this type of organization so definitively,\u201d Evans, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. \u201cThis is especially interesting as this is also one of the first animals that was capable of moving on its own.\u201d\n\nAccording to the researchers, as Q. simpsonorum puttered around this ancient seafloor gobbling up microbes, it left behind an organic mat of nutrients, which they describe as a kind of slime. These left-behind trails became trace fossils, which the team also uncovered in its discovery of Q. simpsonorum.\n\nRelated Story Life Might\u2019ve Had a Pretty Electrifying Beginning\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the most exciting moments when excavating the bed where we found many Quaestio was when we flipped over a rock, brushed it off, and spotted what was obviously a trace fossil behind a Quaestio specimen\u2014a clear sign that the organism was motile; it could move,\u201d Harvard University\u2019s Ian Hughes, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement.\n\nThe importance of this discovery extends far beyond just one species that\u2019s been extinct for half a billion years. It gives researchers a glimpse at the gene expressions necessary to create these first forms of complex life, all while adding context to how complex life can form\u2014whether on Earth or some other planet.\n\nOf course, it also gives hope to experts who continue excavating the area that something else might be waiting to be discovered. \u201cWe\u2019re still finding new things every time we dig,\u201d Hughes said in a press statement. \u201cEven though these were some of the first animal ecosystems in the world, they were already very diverse. We see an explosion of life really early on in the history of animal evolution.\u201d"

        "article_content": "A dog-size reptile slipped through fern-choked forests 237 million years ago in what is today Para\u00edso do Sul, Brazil. The animal had the body of a greyhound, a long neck and tail, and a small, nipping beak. Running on four, upright legs, the reptile looked remarkably like an early dinosaur. Yet it lived almost 10 million years before any other known dinosaurs.\n\nA study published last month in the journal Gondwana Research argues that this animal, Gondwanax paraisensis, in fact is one of the oldest dinosaurs ever found. Further support for this finding could solve the mystery of how and where the largest family of plant-eating dinosaurs emerged.\n\nSince the 1800s, most paleontologists have agreed that all dinosaurs share a common ancestor that emerged in the Triassic Period about 200-250 million years ago, said Steve Brusatte, who is a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh and was not involved in the study. They were reptiles called archosaurs, and some had shared anatomical traits.\n\nThose ancestral dinosaurs split into three major subgroups: predatory theropods, long-necked sauropods and the ornithischians. The last group included diverse and well-known beaked herbivores like Triceratops, Stegosaurus and Iguanodon."

There are six related CVEs listed on their sites, five relating to Bitdefender Total Security and one for Trend Micro Deep Security Agent, and all advise updating to more recent releases. Bitdefender Total Security users are advised to be on product version 27.025.115 or newer, attainable through auto-update, and Trend Micro Deep Security Agent users are advised to update to or download product version 20.0.1-17380.\n\nOf the two companies, Bitdefender seems to have had to patch more vulnerabilities than Trend Micro, though all five are targeted at MITM vulnerabilities in some way. Man In The Middle vulnerabilities allow for the interception and alteration of communications between users and given sites, allowing false pages and certificates to appear legitimate.\n\nBitdefender's HTTPS scanning functionality was failing to verify certificates across five key scenarios properly: certificates lacking \"Server Authentication\" specs in Extended Key Usage extensions, incorrect checks of site certificates using MD5 and SHA1 collision hash functions, trust of unauthorized entities who exploit the \"Basic Constraints\" certificate extension, and improper trust of both certificates using the DSA signature algorithm and self-signed certificates, in general.\n\nThat said, Local Privilege Escalation is also quite a major cybersecurity issue, even if Trend Micro is addressing just one relevant vulnerability. Local Privilege Escalation refers to standard users gaining admin or system-level access, and Trend Micro's gap came about as a result of insufficient authentication controls, which doesn't sound like a great issue for software called Deep Security Agent.\n\nFortunately, the related issues have already been addressed in their respective software updates and these problems shouldn't impact Bitdefender or Trend Micro customers anymore. However, it is noteworthy that, unlike many cyberattacks which find other vectors of infection, these vulnerabilities were all found within existing security software installed specifically on systems trying to avoid attacks like these. Sometimes, less is more \u2014 though of course, the applicability of that mentality can vary greatly depending on your industry."
