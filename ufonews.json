            "article_content": "A flight crew on a private Surjet plane bound for Florida witnessed a bizarre phenomenon while flying over the Bahamas at high altitude. According to the New York Post, the crew - consisting of two pilots and a flight attendant - saw strange, glowing orbs darting around in the night sky, leaving them stunned. The incident occurred on December 23 as they flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane when they received a transmission from Miami air traffic control.\n\nThe flight attendant said she saw the objects appear as white lights in the night sky and transform into green as they observed. Cassandra Martin shared her extraordinary experience with NBC News, revealing that the mysterious object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness.\n\n\"It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it. All of a sudden I heard traffic control say, we have a foreign object, can you please identify it? I looked to the left, and a pilot saw three objects, I only saw one, and I grabbed my phone, I just pressed it to the window to see if I could get a video of what the object was,\" Ms Martin told NBC Miami.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again, and we were about 43, 45 thousand feet and it was way above us,\" she added.\n\nThe object's high altitude and irregular \"zig-zag\" movements, as described by Ms Martin, effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon, respectively.\n\n\"I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is. Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,\" Ms Martin explained."

            "article_content": "C. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nAt CES 2025, the term \u201cAI\u201d was everywhere. All the major brands were pushing it, including Samsung, TCL, Roborock, and more. Even the signage throughout the Las Vegas Convention Center featured AI-generated artwork.\n\nWhen I heard about a new personalized AI wearable at the show called Bee, I couldn\u2019t help but think of the AI fatigue we\u2019ve seen ever since the failures of the Rabbit R1 (which debuted at last year\u2019s CES) and the Humane AI Pin. Those products over-promised and under-delivered, solidifying the idea that most AI hardware probably just needs to be an app.\n\nHonestly, when I walked into the demo suite with the two co-founders of Bee \u2014 Maria de Lourdes Zollo and Ethan Sutin \u2014 I thought I was going to see another Humane or Rabbit fiasco. What I got instead was a nuanced, well-thought-out device that just might make personalized AI a real thing.\n\nWhat is the Bee AI wearable?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nBee is a relatively inexpensive wrist wearable, about the same size and shape as a typical fitness tracker. However, it doesn\u2019t have health sensors, a touch screen, or even a display. Instead, it has a single multi-function button and a pair of microphones.\n\nBee is a fitness-tracker-esque wearable that listens to you all day, every day.\n\nThe purpose of Bee is to listen to your voice all day, every day. The device transcribes that audio in real-time on your connected smartphone and then learns from it through a suite of various large language models (LLMs). Bee didn\u2019t list out which ones it specifically uses, but it said it has its own in-house model as well as models from OpenAI and Google.\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nWith this constant stream of data, Bee can learn all about you. It knows where you go, what you do, and what you say. It can then use this data for various purposes. For example, you can get a summary of your day, almost like a journal written by someone who\u2019s followed your every move. You can also communicate with a personal chatbot trained on you and you alone, allowing you to ask questions like, \u201cWhat did Maria tell me to wear to the party tonight?\u201d It will scour through your data and give you a response.\n\nThe wearable hardware is incredibly simple and sips on power. It charges with a standard USB-C cable and can last up to seven days. You can wear it on your wrist, as you see in the photos above, but you can also remove the device from the yellow silicon strap and put it into a black shirt clip that comes in the retail box.\n\nWould you wear an AI assistant that listens constantly? 171 votes Yes 45 % No 55 %\n\nWhat can you do with Bee?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nIn the image above, you can see an AI-generated daily summary for Ethan, one of Bee\u2019s co-founders. It says, \u201cFrom finalizing media schedules to coordinating partner meetings, the day was filled with preparations for the journey to CES in Las Vegas.\u201d It shows a map of Ethan\u2019s locations (he traveled from San Francisco to Las Vegas that day) and tells him he had seven conversations.\n\nTapping any one of these bits of info will allow you to dive deeper into the data. In the image below, you can see a much more detailed summary of what Ethan did on January 7, 2025. You can read it if you want (Ethan gave me permission to share it), but I\u2019ll save you the time: it\u2019s AI slop. However, the core idea is quite interesting. Myself, I tend to use Google Calendar to figure out where I\u2019ve been and what I\u2019ve done when I can\u2019t remember a date or location, but this is much better than that.\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nThe chatbot aspect is also fascinating. Remember that Bee learns only from you, so the chatbot will be able to relate your feelings, actions, opinions, and more to whatever you ask it about.\n\nBee creates a personalized AI chatbot that you can ask questions to about, well, you.\n\nAs an example of what I mean, let\u2019s say you want to go out to eat somewhere. You can ask your personal chatbot to find a restaurant in Las Vegas. Instead of just scouring for good places to eat, though, it will look for places you would want to eat. If it knows you\u2019re trying to eat healthier, it will take that into account, as it would if it knows you\u2019re a vegan.\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nBee is also an automatic task scheduler; it can create tasks and reminders for you based on your conversations. For example, if you said to someone, \u201cOh yeah, I really want to investigate more into an African vacation,\u201d Bee would automatically create a task for you and schedule it for sometime soon.\n\nUnfortunately, Bee only works with iOS at the moment, but Ethan and co-founder Maria assured me that Android support will be available within the next few weeks.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t this just an app?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nThe \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this just an app?\u201d question will likely dog every AI startup over the next few years. But Bee actually has a good answer to the question: because your smartphone would run out of battery too quickly.\n\nIn order for Bee to be most effective, it needs to be listening as much as possible. If you did this with your phone or smartwatch, the power draw would simply be too great. The Bee hardware solves this problem by always listening in and then letting your phone worry about the rest.\n\nBee is an app, but it's not just an app because your phone battery would melt if it needed to be on and recording you 24/7.\n\nOf course, the next logical question is: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this a smartwatch app?\u201d It does seem a bit incongruous that the Bee wearable needs to exist at all, considering that most people tech-savvy enough for something like this are already wearing a smartwatch or fitness tracker 24/7 anyway.\n\nEthan and Maria explained to me that Bee is already on the Apple Watch. However, Apple makes watchOS so limiting for developers that the app could never fully replicate what the standalone Bee wearable does. The pair told me they hope their eventual planned move to Wear OS will have better results. So, in the future, you might not need the wearable at all.\n\nHowever, for now, to use Bee, you need the wearable. It currently costs $49 for early adopters.\n\nIsn\u2019t Bee a privacy nightmare?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nThis was the first question I asked Ethan and Maria. Won\u2019t people who aren\u2019t wearing Bee be pretty upset about being secretly recorded all the time? What do they do about certain states that require at least two parties to sign off on a recording before that recording becomes legal? Where are all the recordings stored? How does it get from Bee to your phone and then to the cloud?\n\nThese are all valid questions, and Bee explained most of them: Bee only records you. Bee has two microphones on it, which helps with audio isolation. You train the software on your own voice, and so it only cares about what you say. You can go even further with this and have it completely ignore all other voices, but that will make all your conversations seem one-sided, which could negatively affect the efficacy of Bee.\n\nBee has two microphones on it, which helps with audio isolation.

The company doesn\u2019t care about your data. Ethan and Maria are selling hardware and a subscription, which is how they plan to earn a profit with Bee. It is not collecting your data because it is not interested in it.\n\nEthan and Maria are selling hardware and a subscription, which is how they plan to earn a profit with Bee. It is not collecting your data because it is not interested in it. Your data is encrypted, regardless. Even if Ethan and Maria changed their minds down the road, your data is encrypted on your phone, so they couldn\u2019t touch it anyway. Additionally, your LLM is encrypted and siloed from all other LLMs on Bee\u2019s servers. Ethan told me that the hope one day is to have Bee exist completely on the edge \u2014 meaning on your devices exclusively and never going to the cloud at all. He pointed out that, six months ago, you couldn\u2019t do any AI stuff on-device, but now you can do quite a bit. Eventually, LLMs will be smaller and more efficient, and everything Bee does will happen on your device alone. However, they don\u2019t want to wait for that day, so they are relying on cloud-based solutions for now.\n\nGranted, Bee\u2019s security promises are just that \u2014 promises. Still, it was nice to hear from both co-founders that privacy was of utmost importance, and they were coming at Bee with the right principles in mind.\n\nHands-on with Bee: I\u2019m excited to give it a shot\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nMaria and Ethan promised to send me a Bee wearable when Android support rolls out. Honestly, I\u2019m excited to give it a shot. I\u2019ve been told by numerous people in my life \u2014 therapists, friends, and family \u2014 that keeping a daily journal is important. But I\u2019ve just never been able to set the time aside to keep one. Having a digital personal assistant who does all the leg work for me is an ideal compromise, allowing me to reflect on my day/week/month without needing to actually keep a journal.\n\nAlso, staying organized and on-task has always been a big part of my work life, and it seems like Bee could be very good at helping me be even better at that.\n\nOnce I have Bee, I\u2019ll do a full review. But in the meantime, let me know in the comments what you think about this new product. If you want to learn more about Bee, check out the Bee website.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

            "article_content": "Have you ever wondered how some apps seem to know exactly what their users want, delivering seamless experiences while driving growth and engagement? The secret often lies in data\u2014specifically, how that data is collected, analyzed, and acted upon. If you\u2019re building your own app or software project, integrating a powerful analytics tool like Google Analytics 4 (GA4) with artificial intelligence (AI) can feel daunting . Whether you\u2019re a seasoned developer or just starting out, this guide by Corbin Brown will walk you through the process step by step, helping you turn raw user data into actionable insights.\n\nIntegrating GA4 into your application is a crucial step in understanding user behavior, making informed decisions, monitoring key events, and even preparing for advanced features like payment tracking. This isn\u2019t just about setting up analytics; it\u2019s about creating a foundation for smarter decisions and a better user experience. In the following sections, we\u2019ll break it all down\u2014from allowing GA4 and connecting it to Firebase, to deploying your app and troubleshooting common issues.\n\nGoogle Analytics (GA4) Integration with AI\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Enable Google Analytics 4 (GA4) in your Firebase project by linking it to your app and configuring the Measurement ID for accurate user interaction tracking.\n\nIntegrate GA4 with Firebase by updating configuration files, allowing seamless real-time data collection and analysis.\n\nDeploy your app using tools like npm and Firebase CLI, making sure proper setup to avoid deployment errors and disruptions.\n\nSet up event tracking in GA4 to monitor standard and custom events, such as sign-ups and purchases, for actionable insights into user behavior.\n\nPrepare for future enhancements, like integrating Stripe for payment tracking, to expand your app\u2019s capabilities and improve analytics-driven decision-making.\n\n1: Enable Google Analytics 4 (GA4)\n\nThe first step is to enable GA4 within your Firebase project. This involves several key actions:\n\nAccess your Firebase project settings to begin the setup.\n\nLink your app to GA4 to enable data collection.\n\nLocate the Measurement ID, a unique identifier that connects your app to GA4.\n\nThe Measurement ID is essential for tracking user interactions and making sure accurate data collection. Double-check that it is correctly configured in your app to avoid potential issues. Proper setup at this stage ensures a seamless flow of data into GA4 for analysis.\n\n2: Connect GA4 to Firebase\n\nOnce you have the Measurement ID, the next step is to integrate it into your Firebase configuration files. This connection allows Firebase to communicate directly with GA4, allowing real-time data collection and analysis.\n\nBy updating your Firebase configuration with the Measurement ID, you ensure that user behavior is tracked effectively. This integration is critical for making informed, data-driven decisions about your app\u2019s performance and user engagement. A well-configured Firebase-GA4 connection lays the foundation for advanced analytics and future enhancements.\n\nBuild an App with AI and Google Analytics Data\n\nFind more information on AI coding by browsing our extensive range of articles, guides and tutorials.\n\n3: Deploy Your Application\n\nDeploying your app to a production environment is a pivotal step in making it accessible to users. Use tools like npm and Firebase CLI to streamline the deployment process. Follow these steps for a successful deployment:\n\nRun `npm run build` to compile your app and prepare it for production.\n\nto compile your app and prepare it for production.

            "article_content": "Content provided by British Council\n\nRead the following text, and answer questions 1-9 below\n\n[1] Do you believe in ghosts or paranormal activity? Professor Chris French is keen to know why. His research focus is \u201canomalistic psychology\u201d: bizarre experiences that many people have and why they believe in events that do not have a scientific base.\n\n[2] French, a professor emeritus at Goldsmiths College at the University of London in the United Kingdom, explores examples of \u201csupernatural activity\u201d in his research, and in his book The Science of Weird S**t: Why Our Minds Conjure the Paranormal. He investigates ghost sightings, fortune-tellers, clairvoyants and psychics. Alien abductions are also in his scope. If it is a strange thing, French is interested.\n\n[3] Ghost sightings take up most of his time. There are many reasons people think they have seen one. One is a well-proven phenomenon called sleep paralysis, little known outside scientific circles. It can convince even cynics that they are in the presence of a \u2013 usually malicious \u2013 ghost.\n\n[4] \u201cSleep paralysis is a temporary period of paralysis between sleep and wakefulness,\u201d French said. \u201cIt can come with a range of additional symptoms that can make it absolutely terrifying. These include a strong sense of an evil presence and hallucinations like hearing voices or footsteps and seeing demons. Other symptoms include experiencing difficulty in breathing, feeling pressure on the chest and intense fear.\u201d\n\n[5] People go through several different stages during a regular night\u2019s sleep. One is REM, or rapid eye movement, sleep \u2013 the stage associated with vivid dreams. \u201cThe muscles of the body are actually paralysed during this phase, presumably to stop us from acting out the actions of the dream,\u201d French said.\n\n[6] Sometimes, REM sleep dream imagery gets mixed up with feelings of being awake, and we mistakenly believe we are having a supernatural experience. \u201cIt\u2019s a glitch in the normal sleep cycle. It\u2019s as though the brain wakes up, but the body doesn\u2019t \u2013 and all of that imagery spills over into waking consciousness,\u201d said French. Many artistic representations of ghosts and demons from the past probably stem from sleep paralysis, he added.\n\n[7] How about Ouija boards? This apparent way to communicate with the dead involves asking questions and having a form of marker seemingly move across a board of letters and numbers to spell out answers on its own. \u201cWhen people experience the planchette or an upturned wine glass moving around during a Ouija board session, the illusion that some external force is causing the movement is powerful,\u201d French explained. \u201cIn fact, those taking part are making unconscious muscular movements, known as the ideomotor effect.\u201d\n\n[8] Sometimes, ghost stories are cons to make a dollar. But while scammers do exist, our desire to believe is the bigger culprit. \u201cThe single most powerful cognitive bias that we all suffer from is confirmation bias,\u201d said French. \u201cWe pay more attention to evidence that is consistent with what we already believe or would like to be true. And we either ignore evidence [that does not match what we believe] or make up reasons it can be dismissed.\u201d If you believe in ghosts, it is more likely you will think you see one, he said.\n\nSource: South China Moring Post, December 29\n\nQuestions\n\n1.

            "article_content": "Jenny Agutter has hit back at fellow cast members who think the set of Call the Midwife is haunted - but admits she sometimes feels she could be \u201cswallowed up\u201d by the ancient ground in Cornwall.\n\nAnd the veteran actress, 72, believes the BBC drama\u2019s enduring success is down to being rooted in realism - calling out so-called \u201creality\u201d shows as being anything but. Rebecca Gethings, who plays the drama\u2019s Sister Veronica, admitted before Christmas that she has to be accompanied on bathroom breaks during filming on the Surrey set because she finds the corridor to the toilets so spooky.\n\nThe actress also told how, during filming of series 14 last year, the show\u2019s medic took a photo into the darkness having heard a bang. \u201cIf you zoom in, it's a lady in an Edwardian kind of costume, holding what looks to be a pig,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cI've seen the photo and it's pretty compelling.\u201d\n\nImage: BBC / Neal Street Productions / Olly Courtenay) BBC / Neal Street Productions / Olly Courtenay)\n\nBut Jenny, who has been in the drama since it launched in 2012 as head nun Sister Julienne, said she is not convinced. \u201cI don't feel spooked. I've been to much, much spookier places, to tell you the truth,\u201d she told the Mirror. \u201cWhen I'm in Cornwall, which I absolutely love, I'm in a house that's very old.\n\n\"The house doesn't spook me - but what does is a sense that I could turn around and everything might have disappeared. That I'm back in an ancient time where the rocks and the place belong and I don't any longer; that it's all gone. And that's not ghosts or spirits. It's a sense of the ground being so ancient that it can swallow me up.\u201d\n\nJenny and her Swedish husband Johan Tham have lived in Cornwall for more than 30 years. She first visited the county in 1976 to make The Eagle Has Landed alongside Michael Caine and Donald Sutherland. Agreeing that when it comes to paranormal activity she is a skeptic, Jenny explained there are usually rational explanations.\n\n\u201cI do think that we have very, very strong imaginations,\u201d she said. \u201cI do believe that the sense of time can slip and warp. I think that with the paranormal, there are things that we can't explain - but I don't see them as being ghosts, spirits and those things. We all love a good ghost story. We love to be made to feel, \u2018Oh, there's something else that goes on.\u2019 But I like to actually know what's real and what's not and draw a line somewhere.\u2019\u201d\n\nImage: BBC/Neal Street Productions) BBC/Neal Street Productions) Image: BBC / Nealstreat Productions / Ray Burmiston) BBC / Nealstreat Productions / Ray Burmiston)\n\nShe said one of the reasons for Call the Midwife\u2019s ongoing success, with a loyal audience of 7million regularly tuning in, was that writer Heidi Thomas always roots her stories in realism. \u201cReality shows are so unreal,\u201d she complained. The people in those are so unreal and the way they look at life is completely unreal. What we have [on Call the Midwife] is something that is dealing with reality, but it heightens it and the drama's there.\u201d\n\nThis current series has seen the action in Poplar move into the 1970s and Jenny, 72, said it felt very different to when the series kicked off, based on the memoir of Jennifer Worth, set in 1957. \u201cIt\u2019s moving forward in time and there's new stories and the new times and new fashions and new music. It's always feeling different, we\u2019re not just repeating things.\u201d\n\nThe actress said that her own memories of 1970 - just as she was signed up as a teen to appear in her breakthrough film Walkabout - are a world apart. \u201cMy memory of 1970 is very, very different,\u201d she said. Walkabout, filmed in South Africa, was released in 1971 and includes a famous scene in which her character swims nude.\n\nIn the upcoming episodes, Sister Julienne is having to battle once again to save Nonnatus House, with officials arguing that nuns delivering babies are no longer relevant, thanks to the NHS. \u201cI don't think she ever questions what they can do. She just questions that they're allowed to do it,\u201d Jenny explained. Realising that she, as a nun, needs help from outside the religious order, she enlists nurse Trixie Franklin (Helen George) to spearhead the campaign to secure Nonnatus\u2019 future.\n\n\u201cShe knows that Trixie is someone who can move and change things and to make it clear to her what the reality is. She still finds it hard that they\u2019re being pushed aside. She's faced all these problems, they've gone through the wars, they've done all these things. And suddenly, when they seem to have a lot, everything's being taken away. So she's very surprised by that.\u201d\n\n- Call the Midwife continues on Sunday, BBC1, 8pm\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads ."

Their research suggests that the core may have an additional, hidden layer inside it, challenging what scientists have long believed about the planet's structure. This research was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nChallenging long-standing beliefs\n\nFor decades, Earth has been understood to have four main layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The inner core, mostly made of iron and nickel, has always been thought to be solid and uniform. However, this new study indicates there could be more to the story.\n\nAlso Read | 230m away from docking- ISRO Spadex satellites are at their closest so far\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSeismic waves reveal new clues\n\nThe team used data from seismic waves\u2014energy waves that travel through the Earth after earthquakes\u2014to study the inner core. They found that these waves travel at different speeds in different directions, suggesting that the inner core might have two layers instead of one. This discovery could be the result of two separate cooling events in Earth's history.\n\nAlso Read | Zuckerberg claims Biden officials would 'scream' to enforce Covid 'censorship' on Facebook\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHints of two cooling events\n\nOne of the most intriguing findings is that the structure of iron inside the inner core might have changed over time.

            "article_content": "Several prominent tech leaders are planning to attend Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration this month, the latest sign that the industry is trying to bolster its relationship with the president-elect ahead of his return to the White House.OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman plans to go to the swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20, said a company spokesperson. Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg also plans to go to the event, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private information. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment.Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will be at some of the surrounding festivities, according to the company. Uber also plans to host an inauguration party in Washington with Elon Musk\u2019s X social media firm and The Free Press, a media company.Coinbase Global Inc. CEO Brian Armstrong has been invited to events around the inaugural including a presidential dinner, the company said.The prospect of a second Trump term has raised a new set of uncertainties for the rapidly evolving AI market and the wider tech industry. During his first term, Trump clashed with Silicon Valley on issues such as immigration and online content moderation. He has also previously directed his ire at executives such as Zuckerberg and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos.In recent weeks, Meta and Amazon pledged to donate $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. Zuckerberg and Bezos have also dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. And Zuckerberg has been pivoting his stable of social networking apps to become more Trump-friendly, including by eliminating outside fact-checking and loosening the rules around what people can say on the service.Altman, meanwhile, personally donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund after having previously given money to President Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 reelection campaign.\u201cI think AGI will probably get developed during this president\u2019s term, and getting that right seems really important,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg Businessweek in a recent interview, referring to a hypothetical, advanced form of AI. \u201cSupporting the inauguration, I think that\u2019s a relatively small thing. I don\u2019t view that as a big decision either way. But I do think we all should wish for the president\u2019s success.\u201dTrump\u2019s party pledged in its platform to undo Biden\u2019s executive order on AI, saying that it \u201cimposes Radical Leftwing ideas\u201d on the field. With Trump\u2019s win, Musk has also gained newfound influence in Washington. That\u2019s sparked concerns Musk could pursue policies that favor his own companies, including his artificial intelligence startup xAI. Altman, whose company is in a legal battle with Musk, recently said he does not think the billionaire will use his political power against rivals like OpenAI.In addition to Altman, OpenAI President Greg Brockman and Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil also plan to be at the inauguration, according to a company spokesperson. OpenAI also has hired a lobbying firm run by a well-known figure in Trump world, Jeff Miller, according to a filing."

Whether that power shift will translate into seismic change in what we wear is a different question.\n\nThere has been much speculation as to the source of the turmoil. Much blame has focused on a slowdown in luxury spending (especially in China), as well as global political and economic uncertainty, which has led to a game of Blame the Designer (when in doubt, blame the designer), which led to Change the Designer.\n\nThere is a tendency, in such an environment, to play it safe. To fall back into the comfort of a camel coat and assume that what sold well in the past will sell well in the future. To focus on the commercial over the creative."

            "article_content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n\nIn 2024, superconductivity\u2014the flow of electric current with zero resistance\u2014was discovered in three distinct materials. Two instances stretch the textbook understanding of the phenomenon. The third shreds it completely. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely unusual form of superconductivity that a lot of people would have said is not possible,\u201d said Ashvin Vishwanath, a physicist at Harvard University who was not involved in the discoveries.\n\nEver since 1911, when the Dutch scientist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes first saw electrical resistance vanish, superconductivity has captivated physicists. There\u2019s the pure mystery of how it happens: The phenomenon requires electrons, which carry electrical current, to pair up. Electrons repel each other, so how can they be united?\n\nThen there\u2019s the technological promise: Already, superconductivity has enabled the development of MRI machines and powerful particle colliders. If physicists could fully understand how and when the phenomenon arises, perhaps they could engineer a wire that superconducts electricity under everyday conditions rather than exclusively at low temperatures, as is currently the case. World-altering technologies\u2014lossless power grids, magnetically levitating vehicles\u2014might follow.\n\nThe recent spate of discoveries has both compounded the mystery of superconductivity and heightened the optimism. \u201cIt seems to be, in materials, that superconductivity is everywhere,\u201d said Matthew Yankowitz, a physicist at the University of Washington.\n\nThe discoveries stem from a recent revolution in materials science: All three new instances of superconductivity arise in devices assembled from flat sheets of atoms. These materials display unprecedented flexibility; at the touch of a button, physicists can switch them between conducting, insulating, and more exotic behaviors\u2014a modern form of alchemy that has supercharged the hunt for superconductivity.\n\nIt now seems increasingly likely that diverse causes can give rise to the phenomenon. Just as birds, bees and dragonflies all fly using different wing structures, materials seem to pair electrons together in different ways. Even as researchers debate exactly what\u2019s happening in the various two-dimensional materials in question, they anticipate that the growing zoo of superconductors will help them achieve a more universal view of the alluring phenomenon.\n\nPairing Electrons\n\nThe case of Kamerlingh Onnes\u2019 observations (and superconductivity seen in other extremely cold metals) was finally cracked in 1957. John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer figured out that at low temperatures, a material\u2019s jittery atomic lattice quiets down, so more delicate effects come through. Electrons gently tug on protons in the lattice, drawing them inward to create an excess of positive charge. That deformation, known as a phonon, can then draw in a second electron, forming a \u201cCooper pair.\u201d Cooper pairs can all come together into a coherent quantum entity in a way that lone elections can\u2019t. The resulting quantum soup slips frictionlessly in between the material\u2019s atoms, which normally impede electric flow.\n\nBardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer\u2019s theory of phonon-based superconductivity earned them the physics Nobel Prize in 1972. But it turned out not to be the whole story. In the 1980s, physicists found that copper-filled crystals called cuprates could superconduct at higher temperatures, where atomic jiggles wash out phonons. Other similar examples followed."

            "date": "49m",
            "source": "TechCrunch",
            "article_content": "No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT a little over two years ago \u2014 and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared more than eightfold.\n\nDuring that period, the world\u2019s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups.\n\nThe chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It\u2019s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.)\n\nNvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be \u201cgame changers and market makers.\u201d\n\nOf course, Nvidia is not the only large tech corporation writing checks to AI startups. But over the last two years, it was the most active. Compared to Nvidia\u2019s 83 deals in two years (2023 and 2024), Alphabet participated in 73, while Microsoft has done 40 rounds, PitchBook data shows.\n\nBelow is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million over the past two years where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round.\n\nThe billion-dollar-round club\n\nOpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker\u2019s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI\u2019s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion.\n\nxAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk\u2019s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI\u2019s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI\u2019s cap table a few months later.\n\nInflection: One of Nvidia\u2019s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection\u2019s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI\u2019s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future.\n\nWayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nScale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion.\n\nThe many-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars club\n\nCrusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia.\n\nFigure AI: In February, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion.\n\nMistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June.\n\nCohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere\u2019s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup a year prior.\n\nPerplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data.\n\nPoolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion.\n\nCoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave\u2019s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company reportedly has its sights on a $35 billion IPO this year. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis.\n\nSakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion.\n\nImbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt.\n\nWaabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE.\n\nDeals of over a $100 million\n\nAyar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup.\n\nKore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity.\n\nWeka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion.\n\nRunway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce.\n\nBright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup.\n\nEnfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica\u2019s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn\u2019t participate in the round.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data\u2019s Series E round. Nvidia hasn\u2019t invested in Vast Data since the company\u2019s Series D."

            "source": "The Motley Fool",
            "article_content": "Software is expected to have another great year in 2025 fueled by ongoing and rising investment in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDan Ives is one of the most closely followed personalities on Wall Street. Ives leads global technology research for Wedbush Securities, and can often be found touting bullish narratives and forecasts about artificial intelligence (AI) on financial media outlets such as CNBC or Bloomberg.\n\nIn late December, Ives took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to highlight his top 10 AI picks for 2025. Below, I'm going to explore three of his software picks and assess if now looks like a good opportunity to scoop up shares.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Palantir Technologies (PLTR -1.42%) earned a position on Ives' list of top ideas. The primary tailwind fueling Palantir boils down to one thing: the company's newest software suite, dubbed the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Since launching in April 2023, AIP has helped Palantir make a splash in the private sector and remain a competitive option alongside many other data analytics tools flooding the software market.\n\nMoreover, AIP has also helped Palantir form a number of strategic alliances with big tech and consulting firms including Oracle, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon, and Booz Allen Hamilton. Many of these partnerships are focused specifically on integrating AIP across cloud infrastructures within the Department of Defense (DOD) and other military-related agencies. In turn, Palantir has unlocked new ways to accelerate its historically lumpy government business.\n\nWhile I am personally bullish on Palantir's long-term potential, I must also admit that the stock has gotten overwhelmingly expensive. Last year, Palantir was the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 index (^GSPC -1.54%) after the company's shares soared 340%.\n\nAlthough I think 2025 should be another terrific year for Palantir, I'd caution investors against buying into the stock during a pronounced period of momentum.\n\n2. Salesforce\n\nThe next company I'll be exploring is Salesforce (CRM -2.77%). While Salesforce is primarily known for its sales and marketing tools, the company also owns and operates several other platforms that span across areas such as data analytics and workplace productivity.\n\nOver the last couple of years, large language models (LLMs) and machine learning have garnered a lot of the chatter surrounding AI. However, during the company's latest earnings call, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff made it clear that the company's next growth wave revolves around agentic AI.\n\nAgentic AI will utilize generative AI protocols such as LLMs and machine learning applications, but will not require a human to operate as these digital agents become \"smarter\" and more independent over time. Salesforce's agentic AI platform is aptly called Agentforce, and right now it's already being used by some of the world's largest enterprises including IBM, FedEx, and Accenture.\n\nAt the moment, Microsoft's CoPilot is the most mainstream agentic AI offering on the market. Given the limited competition and increasing spending on AI infrastructure, I'm bullish on Salesforce's ability to acquire incremental market share in the agentic AI space and think the company has robust prospects ahead.\n\n3. Snowflake\n\nData infrastructure company Snowflake (SNOW 0.89%) went public around the same time as Palantir back in 2020. Yet unlike Palantir, investors cheered on Snowflake's public debut in historic fashion. Moreover, when AI began to emerge as the next megatrend back in late 2022, it was natural to think that Snowflake would be an obvious beneficiary.\n\nHowever, reality clashed with lofty expectations, and eventually investors began to question if the narrative surrounding Snowflake was rooted in hype. Ultimately, poor investor sentiment around Snowflake resulted in Frank Slootman resigning as the CEO, leaving the company with very little to say about its AI chops and if the technology would ever become a core focus in the business.\n\nWhile the last year has been a tough one for Snowflake, the company is gradually beginning to turn things around. Product revenue is growing 29% year over year, and the company boasts an astounding net revenue retention (NRR) rate of 127% -- indicating that customers are not only remaining on the Snowflake platform, but also spending more.\n\nAccording to the company's CFO Mike Scarpelli, Snowflake's core AI platform, Cortex, is \"still very much in the early innings.\" The way I interpret Snowflake's current situation is that the company has been able to improve key performance indicators without AI being a major contributor yet. To me, this implies that as AI becomes more of a selling point for Snowflake, the company's financial profile should continue to strengthen.\n\nAlthough Snowflake is not yet out of the woods, I am cautiously optimistic about an investment in the stock."

            "article_content": "Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, destruction and devastation in Gaza have been widespread. So has death: 45,000 people have been killed in this conflict, including more than 300 aid workers and more than 1,000 medical professionals, according to tallies by the United Nations.\n\nIt has also been especially deadly for the people documenting it.\n\nAt least 160 journalists, translators, fixers, and others who help with newsgathering have been killed, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. It has been the deadliest period for reporters since the organization began keeping track in 1992, and the vast majority of those killed have been Palestinian.\n\n\"It's been journalists and even their families,\" said former American diplomat Hala Rharrit. \"And it has appeared to practically be systematic targeting of journalists to silence the truth that's been coming out.\"\n\nRharrit spent nearly two decades at the State Department with postings in Asia, Africa and the Middle East before quitting last spring in protest over America's role in the war in Gaza. Before resigning, she was stationed in Dubai where part of her job was to communicate U.S. policy to the Arab press and monitor media reports about the war. She told 60 Minutes she included deaths of journalists in reports she sent to senior leadership in Washington.\n\nShe told 60 Minutes that, a few months after the conflict began, she proposed a statement to come out from the White House against the deaths of journalists.\n\n\"I was told, 'No, we can't do that. It's too controversial.' I said, 'What's controversial? Calling for the protection of journalists? This is an American value,'\" Rharrit recalled.\n\nIn December 2023, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller wrote a statement on X saying in part, \"We stand unequivocally for the protection of journalists and a free and independent press.\"\n\nFive months later, President Joe Biden released his own statement, saying that in Gaza, \"far too many journalists, the vast majority of them Palestinian, have been killed.\" The statement went on to call for \"the protection of journalists everywhere, including during military operations.\"\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have denied the charges that Israel has singled out reporters, telling 60 Minutes in a statement: \"The IDF directs its strikes only towards military targets and military operatives, and does not target civilian objects and civilians, including media organizations and journalists as such.\"\n\nIsrael's military went on to contend that \"terror operatives\" in Gaza have doubled as journalists and might therefore become \"legitimate military targets,\" including some who work for Al Jazeera. The Qatari network has strongly denied this allegation.\n\nCBS News is not able to verify claims on either side. Israel has prevented international media from entering and working independently in Gaza since the start of the war. As a result, Palestinian journalists left to cover the ongoing conflict have had to work while dealing with its effects, including hunger, displacement, and the constant threat of injury or death from ongoing airstrikes.\n\nWithout a ceasefire, those who are reporting on the ground continue to do so at a great risk. Just Friday, Reuters reports a Palestinian journalist was shot and killed by Israeli forces while covering a scene at a refugee camp in Gaza.\n\nThe video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and edited by Scott Rosann."

            "article_content": "Fundstrat chief investment officer Tom Lee says those who turn a blind eye to Bitcoin likely believe that BTC will eventually plunge all the way down to zero.\n\nIn an interview on the Global Money Talk YouTube channel, Lee says Bitcoin has proven its staying power after over a decade of existence.\n\nHe also notes that it\u2019s now very unlikely for Bitcoin to vanish, given that the incoming Trump administration has repeatedly expressed its support for the largest crypto by market cap.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s probably better to just observe a few things. One is Bitcoin has now been around for 15 years, and there has not been a Bitcoin 2.0. So there\u2019s no crypto 2.0, Bitcoin is the surviving chain.\n\nAnd Bitcoin has become a $2 trillion asset which never in financial history has anything reached $2 trillion and then disappeared. It\u2019s a different argument if it was $100 billion.\n\nThird is the US government [has] reiterated its commitment to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset. That\u2019s not bad for the price of Bitcoin. So if someone is watching this and said, \u2018Well, they don\u2019t understand Bitcoin so they decide not to own it.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a catastrophic way to look at markets.\u201d\n\nLee also believes that the macroeconomic backdrop appears to be acting as a tailwind for risk assets like stocks and crypto, at least for the first half of the year. He adds that his bullish stance is supported by jittery market sentiment and the massive amount of cash still waiting in the wings.\n\n\u201cThere is probably room for more positive surprises in the first half because we have an incoming president that\u2019s very pro-business, probably the most pro-business president in modern times. And with, so far, the cabinet selections that the market is very happy with. So that should be providing room for investors to become optimistic which they call \u2018animal spirits.\u2019\n\nAnd the second tailwind is that the Fed is dovish. And what that means is that the central bank is easing. So that\u2019s positive for stocks.\n\nThe third is investors are cautious because almost everyone we talked to thinks valuations are expensive or because we\u2019ve had two good years, [the next year] has to be bad. So we know sentiment is cautious. Usually when people are cautious, then you bet against the caution.\n\nAnd the fourth is that we know mechanically there\u2019s a lot of cash on the sidelines. There\u2019s a lot of firepower \u2013 $7 trillion of cash on the sidelines.\n\nSo I would see this as positive for the first half of [this] year.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

            "article_content": "Shares of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Ltd. opened with losses on Monday, January 13, following a price target of \u20b95,060 assigned by global brokerage firm Goldman Sachs.Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on BSE with a 'Neutral' rating, indicating a potential downside of 1% from the stock's closing price on Friday.The foreign brokerage wrote in its note that BSE stands to benefit from strong growth tailwinds in India\u2019s equity capital markets. It noted that robust nominal growth in the earnings of Indian listed corporations acts as a powerful compounding factor.Goldman Sachs is expecting an 11% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for cash average daily turnover (ADT) and also projects the index options market share to increase to 17%.The brokerage mentioned that reforms in options clearing, leading to lower charges, could boost EBITDA margins by 10% and expand return on equity (RoE) by 5%.However, it emphasised that with valuations nearing all-time highs, BSE's pricing appears aligned with global peers, leaving the risk-reward outlook largely balanced.Another brokerage house Jefferies had earlier downgrded BSE to 'Underperform' from its earlier rating of 'Hold'. However, the brokerage had revised its price target on the stock higher to \u20b93,500 from \u20b92,850 earlier.According to Jefferies, BSE shares have more than doubled in value post the release of market regulator SEBI's new F&O framework led by expectations of gains in market share.The near-term risk-reward for BSE, the brokerage said, while adding that it appears \"unfavourable\" and hence, Jefferies has gone ahead and downgraded the stock.At the current price, BSE has a market capitalisation of over \u20b969,000 crore. On the charts, the stock is neither in the 'Overbought' nor in the 'Oversold' territory with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 45.5. An RSI reading below 30 is considered oversold and above 70 overbought.Out of the nine analysts that have coverage on BSE, five of them have a 'Buy' recommendation, while two each have a 'Hold' and a 'Sell' rating.Shares of BSE settled 1.56% lower on Friday at \u20b95,123.80. The stock has rallied nearly 130% in the last 12 months."

            "article_content": "A flight crew on a private Surjet plane bound for Florida witnessed a bizarre phenomenon while flying over the Bahamas at high altitude. According to the New York Post, the crew - consisting of two pilots and a flight attendant - saw strange, glowing orbs darting around in the night sky, leaving them stunned. The incident occurred on December 23 as they flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane when they received a transmission from Miami air traffic control.\n\nThe flight attendant said she saw the objects appear as white lights in the night sky and transform into green as they observed. Cassandra Martin shared her extraordinary experience with NBC News, revealing that the mysterious object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness.\n\n\"It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it. All of a sudden I heard traffic control say, we have a foreign object, can you please identify it? I looked to the left, and a pilot saw three objects, I only saw one, and I grabbed my phone, I just pressed it to the window to see if I could get a video of what the object was,\" Ms Martin told NBC Miami.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again, and we were about 43, 45 thousand feet and it was way above us,\" she added.\n\nThe object's high altitude and irregular \"zig-zag\" movements, as described by Ms Martin, effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon, respectively.\n\n\"I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is. Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,\" Ms Martin explained."

            "article_content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n\nIn 2024, superconductivity\u2014the flow of electric current with zero resistance\u2014was discovered in three distinct materials. Two instances stretch the textbook understanding of the phenomenon. The third shreds it completely. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely unusual form of superconductivity that a lot of people would have said is not possible,\u201d said Ashvin Vishwanath, a physicist at Harvard University who was not involved in the discoveries.\n\nEver since 1911, when the Dutch scientist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes first saw electrical resistance vanish, superconductivity has captivated physicists. There\u2019s the pure mystery of how it happens: The phenomenon requires electrons, which carry electrical current, to pair up. Electrons repel each other, so how can they be united?\n\nThen there\u2019s the technological promise: Already, superconductivity has enabled the development of MRI machines and powerful particle colliders. If physicists could fully understand how and when the phenomenon arises, perhaps they could engineer a wire that superconducts electricity under everyday conditions rather than exclusively at low temperatures, as is currently the case. World-altering technologies\u2014lossless power grids, magnetically levitating vehicles\u2014might follow.\n\nThe recent spate of discoveries has both compounded the mystery of superconductivity and heightened the optimism. \u201cIt seems to be, in materials, that superconductivity is everywhere,\u201d said Matthew Yankowitz, a physicist at the University of Washington.\n\nThe discoveries stem from a recent revolution in materials science: All three new instances of superconductivity arise in devices assembled from flat sheets of atoms. These materials display unprecedented flexibility; at the touch of a button, physicists can switch them between conducting, insulating, and more exotic behaviors\u2014a modern form of alchemy that has supercharged the hunt for superconductivity.\n\nIt now seems increasingly likely that diverse causes can give rise to the phenomenon. Just as birds, bees and dragonflies all fly using different wing structures, materials seem to pair electrons together in different ways. Even as researchers debate exactly what\u2019s happening in the various two-dimensional materials in question, they anticipate that the growing zoo of superconductors will help them achieve a more universal view of the alluring phenomenon.\n\nPairing Electrons\n\nThe case of Kamerlingh Onnes\u2019 observations (and superconductivity seen in other extremely cold metals) was finally cracked in 1957. John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer figured out that at low temperatures, a material\u2019s jittery atomic lattice quiets down, so more delicate effects come through. Electrons gently tug on protons in the lattice, drawing them inward to create an excess of positive charge. That deformation, known as a phonon, can then draw in a second electron, forming a \u201cCooper pair.\u201d Cooper pairs can all come together into a coherent quantum entity in a way that lone elections can\u2019t. The resulting quantum soup slips frictionlessly in between the material\u2019s atoms, which normally impede electric flow.\n\nBardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer\u2019s theory of phonon-based superconductivity earned them the physics Nobel Prize in 1972. But it turned out not to be the whole story. In the 1980s, physicists found that copper-filled crystals called cuprates could superconduct at higher temperatures, where atomic jiggles wash out phonons. Other similar examples followed."

            "article_content": "On Saturday, the new exhibition area \"Quantum computers \u2013 Supercomputers of the next generation\" opened at the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum (HNF). The exhibition was curated by physicist and educator Dr. David Woitkowski. It is the first exhibition on the subject of quantum computers in a German museum. The Paderborn HNF is the largest computer museum in the world and presents the history of 5000 years of information technology from cuneiform writing to artificial intelligence in its permanent exhibition.\n\nAnzeige\n\n\"Are we at the dawn of a new information age? Are quantum computers replacing our tried-and-tested digital calculating machines as the new supercomputers?\" asks Dr. Jochen Viehoff, Managing Director of the HNF, when introducing the new department. \"With this new department, we want to venture a look into the future of computers and present a technology that seems to contradict our previous experience.\"\n\nThe United Nations has declared 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. Various events will take place throughout Germany throughout the year, and the Paderborn activities are part of the German program.\n\nThe largest quantum bit in the world\n\nAt the center of the exhibition is the \"world's largest quantum bit\": two glowing spheres that are intended to introduce visitors to the concepts of superposition and entanglement.\n\nQuantum bits, or qubits for short, are the basic building blocks of quantum computers. They consist of tiny building blocks that obey the rules of quantum physics. The exhibition focuses in particular on the question of what these qubits are made of. Information panels and demonstrators present four different approaches: superconducting qubits, photons, ions and nuclear spins.\n\nThe \"chandelier\" (provided by Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich) is often used to illustrate a quantum computer. However, this is only used to cool the actual quantum processor, which is installed inside. (Image: Sergei Magel/HNF)\n\nMany of the exhibits come from real research. For example, the exhibition features a \"chandelier cryostat\" from the J\u00fclich Research Center, in which superconducting qubits are installed. An adjacent screen with touch function clearly visualizes what the various components are used for and where the actual quantum processor is located.\n\nAnzeige\n\nThe HNF also presents the experimental setup of a photonic quantum algorithm according to David Deutsch. The aim of this is to use entangled photons, i.e. particles of light, to distinguish a correct coin from a counterfeit coin in just one step.\n\nCurator David Woitkowski demonstrates the Deutsch algorithm with the aid of various mirrors, beam splitters and other optical components. (Image: Sergei Magel/HNF)\n\nOne of the ion traps on display once belonged to Nobel Prize winner Wolfgang Paul. A shoebox-sized quantum computer from the Chinese company SpinQ with two qubits will demonstrate small programs. Another exhibit illustrates Lov Grover's quantum search algorithm using a detailed hidden object picture. A news ticker will provide information on the latest developments, such as the breakthrough in effective error correction by a Google research team, which they recently demonstrated using their latest chip \"Willow\".\n\nAfter the official opening on Saturday evening, numerous visitors crowded into the exhibition, tried out the exhibits and discussed them with experts on site. Some were excitedly debating which architecture would prevail. For others, the possible areas of application for quantum computers were too short. The exhibition thus successfully introduces laypeople to quantum physics and encourages them to think about it.\n\nAnniversary year Nixdorf100\n\nThe opening of the quantum computer area marks the beginning of the Nixdorf100 anniversary year, with which the HNF is celebrating the 100th birthday of Heinz Nixdorf on April 9, 2025. \"With the development of the quantum computer, we are on the brink of a new dawn, just as Heinz Nixdorf dared to do in the 1950s to enter the age of electronics and computers,\" says Viehoff. Over the next twelve months, the HNF will be presenting new exhibition areas, events and various activities.\n\nNobel Prize winner Wolfgang Paul already worked with this ion trap in 1985. It can store dye particles for months and manipulate them electrically. (Image: Sergei Magel/HNF)\n\nHeinz Nixdorf was a German entrepreneur, engineer and pioneer of the computer industry. He founded Nixdorf Computer AG in 1952, which became one of the largest computer companies in Europe under his leadership. Nixdorf was known for his vision of providing powerful and affordable computers for medium-sized companies, which contributed significantly to the digitalization of Germany. He was born in Paderborn in 1925 and died in Hanover in 1986. One of his sons, Martin Nixdorf, became Chairman of the Board of the Heinz Nixdorf Foundation and the Westphalia Foundation.\n\n(spa)"

Genomics, one of the most intricate sciences, deciphers the DNA code that holds information about our biological history, present, and future. Dubbed the \u201celixir of life,\u201d genomics enables humans to correct genetic mutations that impact health. Yet, it also raises thorny ethical questions about the limits of genetic modification and its implications for human nature itself.\n\nAI excels in tackling the challenges inherent in this complexity. With tools like CRISPR-Cas9, precise genetic modifications can now correct hereditary errors responsible for various diseases. Advanced technologies such as DeepCRISPR and CRISPR-Net enhance the accuracy of these modifications and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. AI not only identifies target genes but also designs guide RNA sequences to ensure precise execution of genetic edits. These extraordinary capabilities are redefining our relationship with our bodies, making it possible to predict future diseases, prevent them, and even improve genetic traits before future generations are born.\n\nDespite these advancements, the scientific revolution is not without its challenges and risks. While scientists pursue the dream of biological immortality, privacy concerns emerge as one of the most significant threats. Genetic data analysis, also known as genetic fingerprinting, reveals the biological secrets of individuals, which could potentially be exploited to develop biological weapons or invade personal privacy. Without robust legal and ethical frameworks, these technologies become a double-edged sword\u2014either enhancing human well-being or exposing humanity to exploitation.\n\nBeyond ethical risks, humanity faces new challenges related to increasing reliance on technology. A notable example is the impact of modern devices like GPS systems on the human brain. Studies show that drivers who rely on these systems experience shrinkage in brain regions responsible for navigation, while those who rely on natural skills maintain the health of these areas. This \u201ctechnological colonization,\u201d which threatens to undermine human capabilities, raises questions about the price we pay for technological progress.\n\nThe ongoing scientific revolution is not merely about technical achievements; it is a test of our ethical and human values. Genetic modification and anti-aging technologies may bring biological immortality closer to reality, but the larger question remains: How do we balance scientific ambition with the preservation of human essence? While AI delves into the \u201cbiological library\u201d within our bodies, humanity bears the responsibility of ensuring these innovations serve, rather than dominate, us.\n\nThis complex question gains urgency as scientific progress accelerates, tempting some to prioritize profit or power over ethics. It is crucial to establish regulatory frameworks to govern the use of genetic data and protect it from misuse. Yet, regulations alone are insufficient; societies need a collective awareness of the importance of balancing technological progress with respect for human values.\n\nAs AI and genetic engineering open unprecedented doors to enhancing and prolonging life, the greatest challenge remains ensuring that these innovations reflect our shared aspiration for a more humane and secure future. Technology, with all its potential, is merely a tool; its true value lies in how it is used to serve humanity.\n\nGenomics stands as humanity\u2019s most ambitious and transformative scientific pursuit\u2014a profound journey to decipher the very code of life and reshape its narrative. In unraveling the mysteries of DNA, we are not merely advancing the boundaries of biology; we are fundamentally redefining what it means to be human. This monumental endeavor holds the promise of becoming the ultimate \u201celixir of life,\u201d capable of curing diseases, extending longevity, and enhancing our existence. Yet, it also carries the weight of profound ethical and societal challenges. The true legacy of genomics will be determined by our capacity to wield its power with wisdom, foresight, and responsibility.\n\nThe writer is a researcher specializing in cyber politics, holding a PhD on the topic of \u201cCyberspace and Power Shifts in International Relations.\u201d"
