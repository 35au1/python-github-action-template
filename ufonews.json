        "article_content": "It\u2019s been nearly 2 decades since the \u2018Tic Tac\u2019 incident, here\u2019s what we know about the iconic UFO encounter\n\nLAS VEGAS (KLAS) \u2014 The most consequential UFO incident in modern history is about to reach a milestone, and while the Pentagon still can\u2019t explain what happened, the incident\u2019s impact is still being felt 20 years later.\n\nOn Nov. 14, 2004, U.S. Naval aviators were sent to intercept an otherworldly object that \u201ctook off like a bullet fired from a gun.\u201d It was dubbed the \u201cTic Tac\u201d UFO due to its shape and color, which resembled the popular breath mint. However, this breath mint was 45 feet across. It was detected by the Navy dozens of times in Nov. 2004.\n\nThe now-famous video of the Tic Tac, which was recorded by Navy pilots, was initially buried by the military. However, a clandestine investigation based in Las Vegas eventually documented why the encounter was so revolutionary.\n\nDuring two weeks in Nov. 2004, the world\u2019s most sophisticated sensor systems attached to the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group were befuddled by repeated cat-and-mouse type incursions by unknown objects off of the coast of Southern California. Objects were detected one moment and gone the next. On Nov. 14, radar operators finally got a lock on one object\u2014the Tic Tac.\n\nTop Gun pilot David Fravor was sent to investigate. The commander of the \u201cBlack Aces\u201d Strike Fighter Squadron 41 sped through the skies in his F-18 and could not believe what he saw. Years later, his opinion hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nDavid Fravor, the commander of the \u201cBlack Aces\u201d Strike Fighter Squadron 41 sped through the skies in his F-18 and could not believe what he saw.\n\n\u201cThe video was taken by a crew after us when we came back and landed,\u201d Fravor recounted. \u201cThere were four of us. We chased it visually, and I looked at it for over five minutes.\u201d\n\nFravor described watching it move and interact with his jet. He was confident that what he saw was not one of the usual aerial suspects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bird. It\u2019s not a weather balloon. It had no wings, it had no rotors, there was no wash,\u201d he said. \u201cThe four of us will to this day tell you that we have no idea what we saw, as far as where it was from or what it was, but it had incredible performance characteristics that were well beyond brand new Super Hornets right out of the factory, which [were] the jets we were flying.\u201d\n\nCommander Chad Underwood was in the second F-18 sent after the Tic Tac. A recording device on his plane recorded the grainy image from an infrared sensor. Underwood said a second recording of the incident has never been released, adding that the Tic Tac engaged in active jamming.\n\n\u201cI did get jamming cues on my radar tape,\u201d Underwood said.\n\nAccounts vary regarding what happened to the recordings afterward, although the encounter was not investigated by the Navy, nor was it sent up the organization\u2019s hierarchy. A few years later, a bootleg of the recording appeared online without much fanfare. A more detailed article penned by a former Navy pilot appeared in an online aviation publication without much notice.\n\nIn Dec. 2017, the Tic Tac became worldwide news as the centerpiece of a front-page story in the New York Times. The article revealed the existence of previously unknown Department of Defense programs looking into UFOs. The video of the Tic Tac alongside Fravor\u2019s account was, and still is, viewed as solid proof that genuine unknowns have continued to perplex the world\u2019s most powerful military.\n\nThe New York Times article turned the UFO subject on its head, and other mainstream media started investigating the cover-up. Members of Congress asked questions and demanded briefings. The public showed renewed interest in a subject long dismissed as nonsense. Veteran journalist Ralph Blumenthal said the story was a tough sell to his editors.\n\n\u201cEverything was, you know, it was documented,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cBut it was still a difficult topic for the times to grapple with, and the Times has a history of being very skeptical of UFOs.\u201d\n\nThe larger story exposed a previously unknown investigation into UFO encounters within the U.S. Military. AATIP, or the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, was described as \u201ca program\u201d by some and \u201ca working group\u201d by others.\n\nLue Elizondo, a career intelligence officer who left his Pentagon position in 2017, was instrumental in getting the Tic Tac video into the hands of the New York Times. In 2018, he confirmed that other instances similar to the Tic Tac exist in hidden military files.\n\n\u201cThere are many, many Nimitz incidences that are equally compelling that are told from the eyes of people like Commander Dave Fravor,\u201d Elizondo said, with documents later confirming that Elizondo had taken formal steps to get the Tic Tac video and others like it, released to the public.\n\nChris Mellon, a former intelligence insider, admitted that he put the videos into the hands of the New York Times, creating a wave of publicity that led to the creation of a new Department of Defense investigation: the UAP Task Force. That organization, headed by veteran intelligence professional Jay Stratton, quietly compiled and analyzed other UFO videos and cases. A few of them eventually surfaced in media reports.\n\nVeteran intelligence professional Jay Stratton is interviewed on camera for the first time.\n\nIn Stratton\u2019s very first on-camera interview, he said a major goal of the task force was to reduce the stigma so that more military pilots would be willing to report their encounters, and to give them a formalized process to submit what they saw.\n\n\u201cIf you look back to that Tic Tac incident that happened in 2004, and you know from some of the releases that it wasn\u2019t until 2009, 2010 that things were looked at because they had nowhere to send it,\u201d Stratton said.\n\nWhat has changed in 2024? Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, head of UFO investigation AARO, or the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, said the majority of UFO cases can be explained, as could the Tic Tac if more data were available. However, a detailed analysis of the Tic Tac and its capabilities was created. It was the first case investigated by AAWSAP, the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program, another secretive program based in Las Vegas.\n\nIt\u2019s a project that Dr. James Lacatski, former director of AAWSAP, said did not have a vague purpose.\n\n\u201cIt was completely UFO-related,\u201d Lacatski said.\n\nContrary to what the public has been told, the U.S. government knows quite a bit about the Tic Tac, with one of its goals being to construct its own.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "article_content": "When booting up a game like UFO 50, a collection of 50 titles whose 80s-inspired roots belie the modern design sensibilities that make them special, it's easy to feel overwhelmed.\n\nThe collection was released on September 18, 2024 to critical and commercial acclaim in spite of how unusual it is in the indie landscape, and it's hard to imagine how one would go about tackling the development process of such a vast homage to gaming and its history. So, we sat down with Derek Yu to do just that.\n\nYu, the rockstar indie developer behind Spelunky and Spelunky 2, worked on UFO 50 with a team of five other indie developers for over eight years.\n\n\"Everyone on the team enjoyed the excitement and freedom of 80s gaming \u2013 when game design was less established and less dissected\"\n\nJon Perry, a childhood friend of Yu's, is known for board game design, but turned to video games for this project. Composer Eirik Suhrke has collaborated with Yu in the past, doing the music for Spelunky and Spelunky 2. Paul Hubans is a pixel artist and indie game dev known for Madhouse, Ojiro Fumoto is known for the smash mobile hit Downwell, and Tyriq Plummer is a pixel artist and animator also working on Catacomb Kids.\n\nWe begin our discussion with Yu by diving into how this team managed to wrangle the scope and perspective of such a massive project while dealing with the usual exigencies of making one game, much less 50.\n\n\"When you're working on a game, it's important to zoom out regularly to make sure you're not getting too lost in one small part of the project,\" he says. \"That's even more crucial when it's a collection of 50 games! What helped us zoom out was setting regular deadlines where we'd try to bring each game to a certain level of completeness.\"\n\nAs far as collection-wide design principles went, it was important to Yu and his team to connect games together when they could. However, the first priority from which everything else flowed was making sure that each game could generate its own unique appeal.\n\n\"The most important thing for us was that the games were fun and interesting to work on, so that's where we started when it came to design. But we were always looking for opportunities to connect the games together and reuse connections we'd already made.\"\n\nConnections between finished games is one thing, but how did the team go about structuring their collaborative efforts to create connective tissue between developers while UFO 50 was a work in progress? Yu says it all came down to setting expectations.\n\nWhile he and John Perry directed most of the games in the collection, Ojiro Fumoto specialized in one title: Sunset Drive. Even Suhrke, who did music for the game, has a few credits to his name, as do Hubans and Plummer. This kind of collaboration underscores the team's ability to work together and respect one another's ideas.\n\nThe collection's developers | Image credit: Mossmouth/UFO 50\n\n\"The understanding was that a director of a game would have final say on its design, but everyone was open to collaborating and sharing their work,\" Yu explains. \"By release, every game had gone through multiple passes by different people.\"\n\nHe continues: \"Everyone on the UFO 50 team has a broad set of skills, but we each have our individual strengths and areas of special interest, too. We leveraged those unique skills in a very organic way \u2013 there was a lot of encouragement to just take the initiative if you had a good idea.\"\n\nSeveral projects were scrapped during development, but Yu points out the underappreciated advantage indie game developers have: flexibility.\n\n\"I recall only around a half dozen games that were scrapped, and they were all scrapped early on in their development. So we didn't leave too much on the cutting room floor, in the end. I think that's an area where indies can really take advantage of their flexibility to work efficiently \u2013 you don't have to make it difficult to implement an idea or to cut one.\"\n\nAccording to Yu, this flexibility extended into UFO 50's 80s-inspired design. When we ask why the UFO 50 team chose the era, Yu emphasizes the DIY-spirit of games at the time and how their gameplay and interfaces often brought out creativity in players and designers alike. Basing UFO 50's lore on a fictional video game company that published titles from 1982 through 1989 felt like the natural choice then for such an ambitious celebration of what games can be.\n\n\"I think everyone on the team enjoyed the excitement and freedom of 80s gaming \u2013 when game design was less established and less dissected,\" Yu says. \"And even accounting for instruction manuals, I feel like games were less handholdy, sometimes for the worse but often for the better. There was a raw energy that was very adventurous and the technical limitations didn't get in the way \u2013 if anything, it bred a lot of creativity. We wanted to capture some of that feeling while also applying the good lessons we've learned since then.\"\n\nCapturing such a feeling in 50 games, though, took longer than expected. Yu had originally envisioned the project launching in 2018. He says a number of factors led to the game taking much longer to come out than he originally planned, part of which being the release of Spelunky 2 in 2020.\n\n\"Partly we just underestimated the work, which is common enough when you're working on one game, let alone 50 at once! Also, for me, that initial release window was based on a slightly different idea of the collection, where the individual games were allowed to be a little more raw. After we passed that date, though, it became clear that this was one of those projects that needed to cook as long as it needed to cook.\"\n\nUFO 50's title screen\n\nSo Yu and Suhrke decided to focus on Spelunky 2 and ship that first before turning their full attention back to UFO 50.\n\nIn spite of the delay, when asked if he'd do anything differently if he could go back in time, Yu's answer is definitive: \"I wouldn't change a thing, since both games [Spelunky 2 and UFO 50] launched and have been well-received. And sometimes you need to miss a deadline to put things in the right perspective.\"\n\nYu says that playtesters provided valuable thoughts on how to make the game feel like a fulsome experience in the year leading up to its release.\n\n\"We added most of our external playtesters in the last year of development \u2013 up until that point we had our hands plenty full just working off of our own thoughts. Once the games were all playable from beginning to end and it felt like a full collection, we started inviting friends to try it out.\n\n\"Sometimes you need to miss a deadline to put things in the right perspective\"\n\n\"For the most part, our testers validated the core principles behind UFO 50. Despite the overwhelming nature of having 50 games available at the start, the overall concept seemed compelling to people, especially as they engaged more and more with the fictional history. The hard part was massaging all of the details into the right places and making sure that everything \u2013 the games, the library, the fiction \u2013 worked well together and felt coherent. Design-wise, a lot of our discussions around the testing were about balancing different ways to approach the collection.\"\n\nThe team's approach struck us as a refreshing counterpoint to the usual industry story of games being crunched on and launched at the last minute to meet corporate earnings goals.\n\nHowever, in spite of this fascination and all the fulfillment he found making UFO 50, Yu would caution new indie developers against making such a vast project. While smaller games can still be a powerful vehicle for individuals looking to hone their craft, he says, treating game development as an iterative learning experience is far more rewarding (and sustainable) than banking on one encompassing idea for years on end.\n\n\"I don't think UFO 50 is a great example for new developers to follow, because ultimately it's still a single large game that took [over] eight years to make! That requires a lot of experience and runway. But you could plan to release, maybe not 50 games across eight years, but several games across a few years. Treating game development like a craft or discipline that needs to be learned over time, across multiple released projects, is a solid way to minimize your risk.\"\n\nBattling monsters in Valbrace, game 37 of 50 | Image credit: Mossmouth/UFO 50\n\nHearing Yu's philosophy on games as works of art contextualizes the prospect of future innovation in the indie space and where the craft is going from here. As far as the UFO 50 team is concerned, the game should stand on its own, and post-launch support will only come in to fix bugs and streamline the experience.\n\n\"To me the game itself is the main dialogue we're putting out there \u2013 as an artwork, UFO 50 wasn't designed to be something that keeps changing too much after release, barring any issues that are preventing players from engaging with it in the first place. Mostly we're enjoying watching the community experience the game together and are trying to make ourselves available to support that as best we can.\"\n\nYu lights up while discussing why he makes games. He puts forward a perspective brimming with the kind of empathy that permeates the often zany yet absolutely polished products for which he's known. His audience has only grown since he first released Spelunky, a game that has sold over a million copies and delighted fans across the world. According to Yu, games are a people-driven industry and should be treated as such, especially in the indie space.\n\n\"The game itself is the main dialogue we're putting out there \u2013 as an artwork, UFO 50 wasn't designed to be something that keeps changing too much after release\"\n\n\"Games are made by people more than skill sets, so find people you trust and enjoy working with first and foremost,\" he says.\n\nHe continues to espouse this approach when we ask him to elaborate on what he learned during UFO 50's development process.\n\n\"I obviously learned a lot from the other members of the team, who sharpened my eyes in pretty much every area of game-making. The experience also validated a lot of lessons I'd learned from previous projects. For example, the importance of working with people you trust and the joy of providing meaningful experiences that aren't necessarily what players expect or find immediately comfortable.\"\n\nYu has a radically simple vision for the games industry as informed by his experience working on UFO 50. He created the project with a close group of collaborators and friends, so \u2013 when we ask what value continuity has in game making \u2013 he quickly replies with the following: \"I think continuity can be valuable, for sure, but it shouldn't be forced \u2013 developers should work together because they want to.\"\n\nAnd, at the end of the day, Yu says the impetus for UFO 50 was born out of a desire to accomplish a simple yet lofty goal: to have fun making games."

        "article_content": "UFO theories have long captivated public interest, with many investigators dedicated to uncovering possible evidence of extraterrestrial encounters. Figures like Budd Hopkins, a prominent UFO researcher, have shaped the field, seeking to legitimize and understand alien abduction claims. Among these, Linda Napolitano has become a pivotal figure known for her extraordinary \u201cManhattan Abduction\u201d story. Her account, involving high-profile witnesses and alleged government involvement, has left a lasting impact on UFO lore, stirring debate and fascination. In Netflix\u2019s \u2018The Manhattan Alien Abduction,\u2019 Linda steps forward to defend her experiences, standing firmly by the claims she made decades ago.\n\nLinda Napolitano Reported That She Was Kidnapped By Aliens For a Second Time\n\nLinda Napolitano grew up in New York\u2019s Little Italy, where her father was a Golden Gloves boxer. She shared that her mother had always taught her to expect a traditional life: to marry, raise children, and support her family. However, alleged events in her later years altered her view of reality and transformed her life\u2019s direction. Linda\u2019s story entered the public eye when she first reached out to Budd Hopkins, a renowned UFO investigator and author, in late 1989. She told him she had read some of his books, but she could not get through them because they were traumatizing for her. She recounted an incident when she went on a holiday with her husband to the Catskills, New York, and had a very eerie dream.\n\nShe felt that she was levitating and then woke up the next morning in the forest with a nosebleed. She claimed that she went to the doctor and, upon doing an x-ray, found a spring-like object in her nose. She sent the x-ray to Budd, who was very interested in getting to know what she had experienced by this time. During the time she was working with Budd through hypnosis sessions to unravel her experience, she called him and told him that she might have been abducted again. Linda claimed that around 3:15 a.m. on November 30, 1989, she was lifted from her apartment bedroom by a bright blue light. She described feeling paralyzed and being floated out of her window, high above the street, toward a hovering, metallic UFO.\n\nAccording to Linda, she was transported into the craft, where she encountered several grey-skinned beings with large, almond-shaped eyes who performed various examinations on her. Budd claimed that he had found 23 witnesses corroborating Linda\u2019s abduction, and many of them had reportedly seen her being taken on the night that she mentioned. He started working on a book based on her experiences, and they started doing interviews to elaborate on what they were trying to understand. At this time, Linda used the name Linda Cortile to be in the public domain.\n\nLinda Claimed That Her Family Were Also Abducted by Aliens\n\nAs Budd Hopkins and Linda Napolitano continued their investigation, they began to suspect that government agencies, particularly the FBI, were monitoring their activities, fueling an increasing sense of paranoia. One day, Linda called Budd in a state of alarm, explaining that two men, identifying themselves as FBI agents named Richard and Dan, had visited her. They allegedly questioned her intensely, demanding to know how she had managed to \u201cfloat\u201d out of her apartment window. The two of them even reportedly contacted Budd and told him that they were, in fact, security personnel for Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar, the United Nations Secretary-General at the time. The latter had allegedly seen Linda\u2019s abduction in November 1989 and wanted answers.\n\nOne night, Linda claimed she awoke to an eerie sight: her husband, Stephen Napolitano, and their two sons stood together in the hallway, each with a nosebleed. This shocking event, she alleged, was evidence that her entire family had also been abducted by aliens. Budd Hopkins supported Linda\u2019s theory, suggesting that UFO abductions are often part of a broader attempt to study human behavior, DNA, and familial connections. He posited that aliens may abduct multiple family members to gain insight into genetic patterns and inherited traits, which, he argued, could explain why Linda\u2019s family might have been subjected to these experiences as well.\n\nLinda Reported That She Was Being Threatened By Two Security Personnel\n\nOver time, Linda began to feel increasingly unsafe, always sensing that she was being followed. To protect herself, she got a gun and started wearing a wire whenever she left her home. During one outing, she claimed she was abducted by the same two mysterious agents, Richard and Dan. Linda said she managed to record parts of their interaction, capturing disturbing statements in which they referred to her as a \u201chalf-breed\u201d and made threats, allegedly because they believed she was somehow connected to alien beings. Linda stated that she ultimately managed to escape, though the encounter deepened her sense of vulnerability and fear.\n\nBudd published her account in his 1996 book \u2018Witnessed: The True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions.\u2019 He wanted it to be republished a few years later and a movie to be made, but it did not pan out. Linda\u2019s story remains one of the most debated cases in UFO and alien abduction literature. Critics argue that the lack of independent verification, particularly of P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar\u2019s alleged involvement, weakens the case. Some skeptics suggest that Linda\u2019s story may have been influenced by the growing cultural awareness of alien abduction narratives or by Hopkins\u2019 own research methods, which often included the use of hypnosis. This technique has come under scrutiny for its potential to create false memories.\n\nLinda Napolitano\u2019s Accounts Remain Relevant and Sought-After Even Today\n\nIn addition, Richard and Dan\u2019s identities have never been verified, and no independent evidence has surfaced to corroborate Linda\u2019s claims about their involvement. Skeptics argue that without more concrete evidence, the story remains speculative and may be the result of fabrication or confabulation. Despite the controversy, Linda Napolitano\u2019s case has become one of the most famous in UFO lore, often cited by those who believe in extraterrestrial encounters and alien abductions. Her story has appeared in television documentaries, books, and paranormal media, fueling discussions about the reality of alien encounters and the possibility of government involvement in suppressing information about extraterrestrial phenomena.\n\nOver time, Linda has remained an important part of the community that claims to have experienced alien interactions. In a 2013 Vanity Fair article, Linda was reported to have been a member of an Alien-Abduction Support Group that met annually. In 2022, the documentary \u2018Linda Napolitano: The Alien Abduction of the Century\u2019 revisited the case and her accounts and several theorists and scholars have maintained an interest in her case.\n\nLinda continues to reside in New York, maintaining a low profile and rarely engaging in public appearances. When given the opportunity to speak, however, she stands firm in her accounts of what she experienced. Her sons, Tony and Johnny Napolitano, have grown into responsible adults who deeply love and respect their mother for everything she has done for them, and she now enjoys being a grandmother to two young boys. She remains in touch with Peter Robbins, who was Budd Hopkins\u2019 assistant during their time working together, and considers him a lifelong friend. Her current life is focused on family and health, and the peace of her mind is of foremost importance to her.\n\nRead More: Best Alien Abduction Movies on Netflix"

        "article_content": "If I had to recommend a single indie release this year, it'd probably be Mossmouth's UFO 50, mainly because it's a retro game anthology that actually feels like it could've been made back in the NES era (for the most part) while offering a fresh package.\n\nAmidst the usual onslaught of huge releases towards the end of the year, it's hard to find time for smaller titles if you're in this line of work. Hell, I spend like half of my work hours consuming and writing about other stuff, yet video games are the medium that requires more time and attention. It's easy to get burned out, which is why smaller and breezier games are almost as important as the big ones to stay healthy.\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nFor the last few weeks, UFO 50 (only available on Steam for now) has been my 'game to play while having something on in the background' and I couldn't be more impressed with what Derek Yu and the talented developers behind Downwell, Air Land & Sea, Skorpulac, Catacomb Kids, and Madhouse have put together over nine flippin' years (check out this report on the collection that VG247 published... back in 2017).\n\nOf course, almost everyone has had more projects in the works meanwhile. Chief among them was Spelunky 2, which Yu finally unleashed in 2020. Meanwhile, UFO 50 continued to evolve in silence, and this last September it dropped without making much noise until the press got on top of it. After spending some time (less than I'd like) with it myself, I'm happy to report folks were not exaggerating. This thing whips and should be in the GOTY conversations coming up.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nSure, plenty of solo developers and indie studios have totally nailed the NES-era aesthetic and overarching design philosophies over the years (I just won't stop here to name countless examples), yet a recurring feeling I have is that most of those either feel a tad too modern despite everything else or just old in the worst possible way (rusty and not very fun to play). UFO 50, meanwhile, while not a complete home run (I mean, it literally packs 50 fully-featured, old-ass titles), completely feels like one of those bootleg cartridges full of whatever.\n\nI'm not gonna lie: I noped the f**k out of a handful of the games I've played so far, mainly because I wasn't in the mood to figure out obtuse mechanics or perfect timings, but almost no title in this fictional collection has felt bland or uninspired. There's a clear intent and vision behind all of them, and even if many don't click with me, I can see someone else enjoying the crap outta them. After all, they cover all sorts of genres and even try to replicate the 'evolution' of a fictional game company during the 1980s. Of course, this has led players to discover a meta layer that only makes the package even nuttier.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nControls are kept pretty simple in most cases too, which definitely helps the accessibility factor that permeates the whole thing. I'd consider most of the games included 'hard' by today's standards, but in most cases, it all comes down to the unique game design and the developers going 'look, you gotta master this s**t like back in the day, no excuses' (which rocks). This also applies to titles that include a multiplayer option or are straight-up designed as local party games; they're meant to be easy to pick up and just play in quick sessions.\n\nThis ain't a review, so I won't pretend to have played the full collection nor I'll get into specifics. This is a super juicy bundle of joy that I'll be playing for a long time, and I'm taking my time with it. It shines brighter when played between larger gaming sessions or during lunch breaks, and I strongly believe it doesn't benefit from brain-rotting, sweaty marathons better suited for modern video games. This is the message I'm trying to get across; I want you to discover what it has to offer for yourself.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nThis also means it's sort of the perfect game to play on your Steam Deck; I'd be surprised if it doesn't reach the Switch sooner rather than later. Instead of \"one more round,\" you'll be saying \"one more game,\" as you never know what you'll come across next. It's okay if you never beat them, as the experience alone of booting them up and fumbling around is magical and enriching enough. In a way, UFO 50 brings back that magic of ancient games you booted up over and over again but rarely managed to beat. Achievements await true sickos though.\n\nOkay, maybe I'll let you have some of my personal recommendations so far before I leave: Mortol, Velgress, Attactics, Bushido Ball, Camouflage, Campanella, Warptank (this one is genuinely fantastic), and Porgy. Try not to look them up before jumping in, trust me. This wild ride shouldn't be spoiled by our modern model of consumption. Your list of favorites might look very different, and that's the entire point of this trip down a memory lane that doesn't quite exist."

While many of us are experts at finding the right app for our needs, many users need assistance locating the right app. The app discovery process for them is quite different, and these users often have questions about the app\u2019s working but cannot locate their answers in the app listing. Google could be working on improving this experience, and it could use AI to generate answers to users\u2019 questions on app listings.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else. An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\n\nGoogle Play Store v43.3.32-31 contains new strings that indicate that Google is working on a new AI-powered feature called \u201cAsk a question.\u201d Take a look at the new strings:\n\nCode Copy Text <string>Created by AI</string> <string>Ask a question about this app</string> <string>Ask a question</string>\n\nWe spotted AI-generated FAQs in the Play Store earlier in the year, so this would mark \u201cAsk a question\u201d as the second AI-powered feature. These FAQs are pre-generated by the Play Store using AI, so while they address common questions, there\u2019s room to tune the responses further based on personal questions. The upcoming \u201cAsk a question\u201d feature could be a step in that direction, as it would presumably let users ask questions about the app or game listing they are currently viewing.\n\nAccording to other clues within the app, this AI feature will likely be visible on the individual app listing page and search results. Users will likely see a button or the text \u201cAsk a question,\u201d which will show an input field where they can enter their questions to receive an AI-generated answer.\n\nThis AI-generated question-and-answer feature is not currently live in the Google Play Store. Google has not shared anything about this feature, so we don\u2019t know if and when it will go live for users. However, a feature like this aligns well with good, practical use cases for AI and would help users and app developers alike, so we hope the feature comes to fruition.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

        "article_content": "Let\u2019s face it. The official voter guide, Colorado\u2019s Blue Book can be intimidating.\n\nAnd this year, it\u2019s overwhelming. Students in a southwest Denver civics class suspected that\u2019s one reason people don\u2019t vote.\n\nThey thought, what if they used artificial intelligence to create a way to simplify voting and make it, well, more user-friendly?\n\nAfter learning about who votes and who doesn't in the population, they created two powerful tools aimed at helping people register to vote and understand candidates and ballot measures \u2014 in multiple languages.\n\n\u201cI wanted to connect to more people to let them know that their vote really matters and that it should be heard,\u201d said Hector, 17, a senior at DSST College View.\n\nThe app, VoteWise Colorado, takes you through the voting process step by step and the chatbot answers any questions you have about the questions on your ballot.\n\n\u201cThe main goal was access and support for people to understand the voting process and get informed to vote,\u201d said civics teacher Zach Kennelly.\n\nThe students first asked, who\u2019s not voting?\n\nThey decided they wanted the app to target youth and immigrants who are eligible to vote but may be more comfortable using their native languages. Young people traditionally are much less likely to vote than older Americans. Hispanic and Asian Americans make up the largest number of immigrants eligible for voters. Many students have family members who are naturalized citizens and struggle with the technical language.\n\nRight now, people can use the app and bot in English, Spanish and Vietnamese.\n\n\u201cThe things that promote voting are primarily focused on English-speaking people,\u201d said Orion, who hopes students can expand the number of languages on the app. \u201cNow they're going to have just as much of a chance to learn how to vote and do all this great stuff as everyone else in America.\u201d\n\nHector, whose first language is Spanish, said it makes him feel \u201cempowered\u201d and \u201cheard\u201d to see other languages represented.\n\nWithout further ado, I want to test-drive this baby\n\nJuan helps me start my voting journey.\n\n\u201cAm I registered to vote?\u201d I ask.\n\nHe types in the question to the bot and it takes me to the official Colorado voter website where I quickly find out I am. If I wasn\u2019t, I\u2019m on the official page where I can register.\n\n\u201cWhen will my ballot arrive in the mail?\u201d is my next question.\n\n(It already has but I wanted to see if it gives the correct answer. It does.)\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on my ballot this year?\u201d I query.\n\nMarabella, 17, reads off the chatbot\u2019s answer, a nice tight summary of the 14 statewide measures I\u2019ll be voting on, like tax measures, constitutional rights, criminal justice matters, wildlife protection, along with judge retention and state and congressional races.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple-easy-to-understand introduction. I\u2019m starting to see how this could appeal to younger generations who like information in bite-sized pieces.\n\nJenny Brundin/CPR News Gianna Geraffo, a civics teacher at DSST College View, asks her class to use the app and chatbot they created to learn more about an issue on Colorado's ballot, on Oct. 15, 2024.\n\nJenny Brundin/CPR News Gianna Geraffo, a civics teacher at DSST College View, runs through the VoteWise Colorado app her students helped create, on Oct. 15, 2024.\n\nThen I start asking the chatbot about each measure like, \u201cTell me more about Proposition 129.\u201d\n\nIt tells me about the proposed creation of a veterinary professional associates\u2019 degree in simple language, what a \u201cyes\u201d vote would mean and what a \u201cno\u201d vote would mean.\n\nI ask for, and the AI responds with short and sweet \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cagainst\u201d positions. Most importantly, another student Angel tells me this isn\u2019t like doing a Google search that can draw off of unreliable sources.\n\n\u201cBots like these, we\u2019ve made them trained on the actual Blue Book and what\u2019s inside the actual documents,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a more secure way to understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nUsers can even keep going, engaging with the chatbot in helping them reflect on their identity as a voter.\n\nIt also helps you figure out how to track your ballot and provides links to election results.\n\nWhat it means to be an informed voter\n\nGianna Geraffo\u2019s civics class down the hall also helped build the app and bot. Right now, students who are 18 are making a voting plan, while 17-year-olds are exploring the ballot and doing some research on a measure that is most important to them.\n\n\u201cI think I wouldn\u2019t have been engaged at all \u2026 I would have waited also because it\u2019s not something you're taught, it\u2019s supposed to find out for yourself,\u201d said Citlali, who has pre-registered to vote. \u201cIt\u2019s prepared me and it's giving me more options and resources of how I can vote.\u201d\n\nJenny Brundin/CPR News Students Mike, Citlali, and Josephine, review some of the Colorado ballot measures they find through their VoteWise Colorado app and chatbot, Oct. 15, 2024.\n\nStudents say many people they know are unsure of how to vote and what to vote for or against. They think the app will help.\n\nLeonard is going to help his two nephews, who are older than him, vote.\n\n\u201cI don't know if my brother's going to really guide them along so it would be nice just to help them out.\u201d\n\nFor Geraffo, the project was also satisfying. She said it taught students how to use technical skills ethically that they may need in the future. And it addresses the huge gap she sees in voter and civic engagement.\n\n\u201cPart of why I'm a teacher is because I want to help close that gap and empower students and people to realize they do have a voice and there are a lot of ways that their voice can be heard.\u201d\n\nHands-on learning resonates more deeply with the students\n\nZach Kennelly circulates among his students as they check out their finished products for the first time. They reflect on what they like and what could be improved upon. The colors? The design? Students built them in just two weeks.\n\n\u201cBefore AI, creating this type of stuff would take forever,\u201d said Caden, who worked on making sure the app led people seamlessly to candidate information. \u201cIt\u2019s getting increasingly useful not having to memorize code, actually having a bot give it to you.\u201d\n\nJenny Brundin/CPR News Zach Kennelly, who teaches civics at DSST College View, reviews some of the ideas students learned about before they started to build a voter app and chatbot, on Oct. 15, 2024.\n\nMany students said they don\u2019t like the \u2018busy work\u2019 for grades that they do in school and prefer this style of learning.\n\n\u201cIt gave me a chance to be creative,\u201d said Angel. \u201cIt was going to be something that was actually going to be used \u2026 something big and relevant right now ... not just some work I had to write down and memorize for class.\u201d\n\nAngel welcomed the opportunity to use AI.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting smarter and smarter and smarter, it\u2019s going to be more important later in my life, so I think it was important to learn about this tool and how to use it and how to actually create something from it,\u201d he said.\n\nIndustry partner Tinman Kinetics, which builds software for companies that need AI-based solutions, helped with the project. Students used the platform Playlab, a nonprofit AI company that gives access to teachers to large language models for educational uses. Students practiced building chatbots.\n\nJenny Brundin/CPR News Gianna Geraffo, a civics teacher at DSST College View, helps Josephine, 17, with a question about voting, on Oct. 15, 2024.\n\nThey also used Claude, an AI assistant that generates text content in human-like conversations and code to generate \u201cartifacts\u201d or draft web pages quickly. To tie each group\u2019s work together, Tinman Kinetics linked all the coding together using a program called Boxcar.\n\nThe company\u2019s Justin Williams said it\u2019s a unique moment in history \u2013 young people have the power to shape the direction AI will take.\n\n\u201cFuture generations are going to judge us on what we do with this powerful technology today,\u201d he said.\n\nThough they\u2019re too cool to show it, the students are excited their names are on the credits of the two products.\n\nAs the class winds down, Williams tells them:\n\n\u201cCongratulations, this (app and bot) is public. This is live right now.\u201d\n\nThere are smiles."

The group has received calls from as far away as Minnesota.\n\nIt began shortly after LaFleur's father died in September 2008.\n\n\"I've always kind of been interested in it,\" he said. \"After my dad passed away, I think I got more interested in it. And that's kind of when I started doing the investigating.\"\n\nIt's not clear if there are any other paranormal investigators actively working in the Sioux City metro, but LaFleur's outfit is likely the best equipped:\n\nThe group primarily engages in investigations, rather than remediation work; however, they've done that too, to some extent.\n\n\"We have done a few cases where we did bring in like a psychic that had been very well-vetted before we brought them in,\" he said. \"In order to help somebody.\"\n\nThe Journal spoke with LaFleur for its Five Questions series. Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAre ghosts real?\n\n\"That's a hard one to really answer, but -- I can honestly say that there is something after this life, that we experience, or someplace else that we go. Like, once we leave our physical bodies -- we're basically made of, what, water and energy, right? So, our bodies go back into the ground. The energy goes somewhere. So, to me, the energy just goes back into the atmosphere, or what have you. And that's what allows us to be able to travel after we pass on. Whether or not heaven exists or hell exists, I'm not sure, but, I can say that loved ones do come back and visit.\"\n\nAre there any non-ghost paranormal entities that you encounter?\n\n\"We've had some clients who've claimed to have demonic activity, or malicious-type activity. And we've never been able to substantiate that, or confirm that. Just because we don't capture any evidence for it. Normally if you have a demonic or malicious spirit, they're going to let you know. It doesn't matter who's there, it doesn't matter what time of day it is. We've never come across that. I'm kind of glad.\"\n\nYou use a lot of electronic equipment in your work. How do you feel about the more old-fashioned apparatuses, like Ouija boards, that have been in use for more than a century?\n\n\"Ouija boards, we tend to stay away from those. Just from the fact that, when you start messing around with those things, and if you're not careful, you can open up doors to things that you don't want opened. And if you don't close them correctly, whatever doors you opened stay open. Until somebody who knows what they're doing can close them. And by the time that comes around, you've probably had so much 'activity,' or things happening in your life, that -- you'd probably wish you'd never touched it.\"\n\nYou've said that not all paranormal entities are bad. Are the non-malicious ones friendly, or morally ambiguous, so to speak?\n\n\"I would say that a majority of the ones that we come across, that are what you would call an intelligent entity, is usually what we run across the most. Those are basically entities that know their surroundings, they know what's going on, they know what's happening.\n\nI would say most of the ones that we come across are intelligent, most of the time, and are friendly. Some of them are just hanging around, or they're just visiting, or trying to get attention. They're just trying to get the person's attention to let them know, 'Hey, I'm still here. Don't forget about me.'\"\n\nSo there are relatively few unpleasant ones?\n\n\"Yeah those are -- I wouldn't say that they were like an everyday occurrence. They're a special circumstances kind of thing. And what I mean by that is, if you give off a lot of negative energy, and say you're in a relationship for instance, and in that relationship you constantly fight, you're constantly arguing, you're constantly physically fighting and bringing a lot of negative energy into your atmosphere, your area, then chances are you could draw up something negative, like a poltergeist-type activity. And we've had a few cases where we've run into something like that.\n\nAnd once you have something like that going on, the best way to get rid of it is to stop the fighting, stop the negativity, have somebody come in, do a cleansing of the house and bless it. I'm not afraid to tell people, you know, 'Hey, if you guys are fighting that much and not getting along, you guys need to go get some counseling, go get some help, and try to solve that, so that you can get rid of this energy, and get rid of these things that are happening. Because if not, they're just going to continue happening.'\"\n\nBONUS QUESTION:\n\nSo, the behavior of living people can have an affect on these things?\n\n\"Oh, 100%.\""

        "article_content": "While the paranormal might be a cause for fear to many, an intrepid group of Aggies prefer exploring the most haunted locations in Texas to find proof of lingering spirits.\n\nIn 2023, Forbes ranked Texas as the most haunted state in America with over 13,710 cemeteries, 7,517 ghost sightings, 925 haunted locations and 158 paranormal investigators. The Brazos Valley is no stranger to ghost stories and haunted locations, including the LaSalle Hotel in Downtown Bryan and the Animal Industries Building on the Texas A&M University campus.\n\nThe Texas A&M Paranormal Society (TAPS) brings believers and skeptics alike to haunted locations across Texas along with professional-level ghost hunting gear to test for paranormal activity and, hopefully, find evidence to one of life\u2019s greatest mysteries.\n\nIsa Rodriguez, TAPS president, recently led a paranormal investigation at the Queen Theatre in Downtown Bryan, which was rumored to be haunted after someone died from suicide in a nearby building years ago.\n\n\u201cWe also went to the Queen Theatre last semester and had a great time. I think that was one of the most active places I had ever been to back when I was vice president,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cLuckily, we have a really good relationship with the owner. They love to hear what we find and they trust us. \u2026 There\u2019s this pit in the back, behind the screen, and we got a lot of vocal evidence with the spirit box.\u201d\n\nParanormal investigators use a variety of tools to find evidence of the paranormal. A spirit box, also known as a ghost box, is a radio with a frequency scan that jumps from station to station, occasionally giving the listener words or phrases as it is believed that spirits communicate over different radio frequencies. Similarly, investigators may use an EMF (electromagnetic field radiation) reader, thermometer or motion detector in their hunts.\n\nRodriguez said she\u2019s had her own paranormal encounter on campus at Francis Hall which has been rumored to be haunted since 2003, especially in the early morning hours.\n\n\u201cWe investigated Francis Hall on campus and that was one of the first places that I\u2019d genuinely had a paranormal encounter and something that was inexplicable, because we were up on the third floor and I heard a child\u2019s laugh,\u201d she said. \u201cEver since then, I thank God I\u2019m not a construction science major, because I do not step foot in there by myself.\u201d\n\nOne of the other supposedly haunted locations on campus is the Animal Industries building where it is rumored, in 1965, the meat laboratory manager accidentally sliced through his femoral artery when trying to cut meat. The man bled to death and has allegedly been haunting the building ever since with some saying they have heard screams in the hallways late at night.\n\nAs a senior soon to graduate from A&M, Rodriguez hopes TAPS continues to grow and welcome both believers and non-believers.\n\n\u201cI think the paranormal is definitely something to explore and to accept, regardless of if you\u2019re a skeptic or not. There\u2019s skeptics in our organization,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a joy to lead this group and cultivate a space for them to be themselves and explore things that are still unknown.\u201d\n\nRhett England, public relations officer for TAPS, has been in the group for nearly four years since freshman year and has seen his fair share of haunts and paranormal encounters.\n\n\u201cWe went to a location called Tejas Barbecue in Tomball. At that investigation, I was touched on my side. I thought it was one of the members who was standing by me, and I asked him if he was touching me. He said no,\u201d England recalled. \u201cAnd we got this on video, but I had a drawstring bag and one of the strings kept moving side to side while I was standing still.\u201d\n\nMultiple types of hauntings exist, England said, which could influence the evidence the group is able to find.\n\n\u201cResidual haunting is just repetitive and triggered by something, like a certain day of the year,\u201d England said. \u201cFor example, if you died on Oct. 31, you\u2019re more likely to reappear on that day, or like Gettysburg where you\u2019ll hear the sounds of screaming soldiers.\u201d\n\nEngland said one of the biggest misconceptions people may have about TAPS is that they deny scientific knowledge.\n\n\u201cI think people should approach the paranormal with an open mind because I do believe in science, but I think science is a developing field, so it can only explain so many things,\u201d he said. \u201cI like that we\u2019re about to actually go and investigate places with actual equipment because I\u2019ve never had the opportunity before in my life to do something like that.\u201d\n\nAngelina Garcia, vice president of TAPS, is currently a sophomore sociology student at A&M and has a deep appreciation for learning about how cultures around the world discuss the paranormal.\n\n\u201cI think where I grew up in San Antonio and being Hispanic, there\u2019s obviously a very big connection to the dead and what happens after you die,\u201d she said. \u201cSo maybe, subconsciously, my Hispanic heritage and my family really pushed me to go into both my degree and TAPS.\u201d\n\nParanormal investigations often have been portrayed on TV shows and video games but their level of accuracy is not always accurate, Garcia said.\n\n\u201cEspecially now that I\u2019ve done my own investigations, and I\u2019ve used a decent amount of the equipment, everything that you watch is obviously very dramatized, and a lot of it is faked,\u201d she said. \u201cI think at the core of a lot of shows, it is true to how investigations are conducted, especially for the more realistic shows like the earlier seasons of \u2018Ghost Adventures.\u2019\u201d\n\nGarcia said, in her experience, people can have a pessimistic view on the afterlife while TAPS gives A&M students the opportunity to explore the unknown with friends.\n\n\u201cI feel like TAPS is a very good club, for lack of a better word, for the misfits, the ones who believe in spirits and those who may be a little alternative. There\u2019s not a lot of spaces for us on campus and I really want us to stay and expand so we can be a space for the kids that may not fit in with the general student population,\u201d she said. \u201cI like to think it\u2019s worth investigating into spirits. It\u2019s good to know there\u2019s more than just us on Earth or out there.\u201d\n\nAlas, no reports of paranormal activity was experienced in the group\u2019s latest trip to the Queen Theatre."

        "article_content": "Timed with Halloween, a group of thrill-seekers gathered at Oak Park\u2019s historic Pleasant Home on Friday to learn more about the 19th century mansion\u2019s alleged supernatural occurrences from experts.\n\nParticipants explored the historic Pleasant Home alongside a team of paranormal investigators from The Other Side Investigations, roaming the eerie rooms and corridors of Pleasant Home using ghost-hunting equipment to uncover the mysteries behind its storied past and reported supernatural phenomena.\n\nIn small groups, attendees explored different areas of the house. Equipped with devices provided by The Other Side Investigations team, they searched for signs of paranormal activity. The Other Side Investigations team guided them through the experience explaining the equipment used to detect paranormal activity, such as the REM Pod, ghost box, and K2 meters. They also shared personal stories and insights from their own ghost hunting experiences.\n\nAnd indeed, after the event, some claimed to have experienced some paranormal activity.\n\nOak Park resident Elli Wade, visiting Pleasant Home for the first time, said the group encountered some paranormal activity in the billiard room. Wade was holding the K2 Meter while in a circle with other attendees sitting down and the reading of the K2 meter went from a 0.1 to a 0.4 reading. The Other Side Investigations told the room that because of the change of that meter, there was paranormal activity going on.\n\n\u201cIt was very cool to actually see it happen in front of my eyes,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThis is such a beautiful house and it\u2019s fun to do something like this. I\u2019ve never done anything like this before. I love Halloween. We joke that Halloween is my Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nPhoto provided\n\n\u201cThis was a little sample bite and appetizer of ghost hunting. We love to help people. Sometimes the unknown is very scary for some people,\u201d said Lesley Tuton, an investigation coordinator from the team.\n\nThe Other Side Investigations acquisitioner David Amesquita shared his hopes for the event, saying he wanted attendees to experience the beauty of Pleasant Home firsthand. For those who hadn\u2019t visited before, he felt it was a perfect opportunity to appreciate the mansion\u2019s charm up close.\n\n\u201cI go out and try to find different locations for us to visit, whether it\u2019s through various park districts or libraries. I try to get our name out there and secure more places to explore. I also look for different haunted houses and people often reach out to me so we can set something up,\u201d Amesquita said.\n\nNoelle Combs, historic properties and special events coordinator for the Park District of Oak Park, started her work with the park district in March and has had her fair share of eerie experiences at Pleasant Home.\n\nCombs told the group that she recently saw a figure in a top hat walk by in the mirror that can be seen when heading up to the second floor and when she looked up, there was nothing.\n\nCombs said she has seen unexplained door slammings and that Susan Crane, the historic properties and special events manager, smelled tobacco when nobody would be smoking.\n\n\u201cI never feel scared in this house. I didn\u2019t want to tell anyone about those things. You guys are experts, but like you said, you only get to come at night. I\u2019m here sometimes from nine in the morning until eleven at night and things do happen,\u201d Combs said.\n\nEvent attendees also heard about the rich history of Pleasant Home from Paula Fenza, a docent for the mansion for more than nine years. Fenza said that Pleasant Home was built in 1897 by architect George Washington Maher for John Farson, his wife, Mamie, and their two sons, John Jr. and William. The family moved into the house in 1899.\n\n\u201cJohn and Mamie had wonderful, lavish parties. They would be so happy to see all of you here, because this is what they loved to do, welcome people into their home,\u201d Fenza said.\n\nPhoto provided\n\nAfter John Farson died in 1910, Mamie sold Pleasant Home, along with its custom furnishings, to inventor Herbert Mills, known for creating the slot machine and the railroad crossing gate. Mills lived in the house with his wife Leonie and their eight children until his death in 1929, followed by Leonie\u2019s passing in 1930.\n\nIn 1939, the children sold the house and its four-acre estate to the Park District, stipulating two conditions: the grounds were to be opened as a public park named Mills Park in honor of their father; and the home was to be preserved and used as a gathering space for the community. Today, Pleasant Home serves as a historic landmark and venue for guided tours and local events.\n\nThe Other Side Investigations team is expected to return to Oak Park this spring for another public investigation, this time at the historic Cheney Mansion.\n\nRelated"

The fungus is called Phanerochaete velutina, and while it isn\u2019t overly intelligent\u2014it won\u2019t be taking over the world anytime soon like the fungus in The Last of Us\u2014it still shows signs of recognizing shapes and even being able to communicate about its surroundings with the rest of its fungal network.\n\nThe researchers who made the discovery highlight their findings in a paper published in the journal Funal Ecology. In the paper, they discuss how they conducted various experiments, including one where they arranged small wood blocks in several different shapes and allowed the fungi to spread within the shapes.\n\nAs the rare and intelligent fungus spread, they found that it was able to make different decisions based on the type of arrangement the blocks had been set up in. Instead of just spreading out from a central point, they were able to change how they spread out to fit the shape more effectively. This suggests a rudimentary level of intelligence is found within P. velutina.\n\nAccording to the paper, when the fungi were placed in a circle arrangement of blocks, they were able to figure out where the blocks were and then pass that information to the rest of the network, as they never moved to the center of the circle. They seemed to realize that no blocks would be found there. The researchers say this means that the fungal mycelium can \u201crecognize\u201d the difference in the spatial arrangement of wooden blocks.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

The mammal, roughly the size of a muskrat, lived when Colorado was nothing more than an inland sea with the land surrounding it comprising of marshes and swamp land, according to a team of researchers at the University of Colorado (CU), Boulder who had been digging outside of Rangely for over 15 years.\n\nLed by CU's Jaelyn Eberle, the research has been published in the journal PLOS ONE. The discovery, which Eberle and her colleagues identified from a piece of jawbone and three molar teeth, has been named Heleocola piceanus.\n\nThe study stated that the morsel-sized mammal living in an ecosystem with tyrannosaurs, dromaeosaurs, oviraptorosaurs and ornithomimosaurs exhibited a \"number of characteristics suggesting a diet more in line with plant-dominated omnivory\".\n\n\"In general, the molar morphology largely agrees with a plant-dominated omnivorous diet, with blunt crests, inflated cusps, and a low trigonid/talonid height differential,\" the study stated, adding that H. piceanus may have incorporated insects and/or small vertebrates into its diet along with roots, fruits, and nuts.\n\nAlso read | 380 New Species Discovered In This Remote Part Of The World, Say Researchers\n\n'Holy cow'\n\nJohn Forster, one of the co-authors of the study added that he first saw the bit of mammal jaw emerge from a slab of sandstone that he collected from the site in 2016.\n\n\"I said, 'Holy cow, that's huge',\" Foster, a scientist at the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum in Vernal said.\n\nMeanwhile, Eberle said she was glad that discovery was made in Rangely, which sits in the northwest corner of the state, not far from Dinosaur National Monument.\n\n\"It's a small town, but, in my experience as a paleontologist, a lot of cool things come out of rural environments,\" Eberle was quoted as saying by CU Boulder Today. \"It's nice to see western Colorado have an exciting discovery. We have scientists that come from all over the world specifically to study our fossils. We really are lucky.\"\n\nShe added that the swamp dweller's size was actually relatively large compared to most Cretaceous period mammals.\n\n\"They're not all tiny. There are a few animals emerging from the Late Cretaceous that are bigger than what we anticipated 20 years ago.\"\n\nThe discovery of H. piceanus has added a new dimension to scientists and their understanding of mammalian life during the era when non-avian dinosaurs roamed the Earth before being wiped out by an asteroid 66 million years ago."

They really come back home hoping to give the Stadium the kind of week it had once back in 2001, when another Yankee team came back down 0-2 and lifted the city at that terrible time and gave it three wins and three nights that will never be forgotten, even if the D-backs ended up winning that World Series in the end."

Gartner said worldwide IT spending is expected to total $5.74 trillion in 2025, an increase of 9.3% from 2024.\n\n2025 Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends - Gartner Gartner\n\n\"It is clear that no matter where we go, we cannot avoid the impact of AI,\" said Daryl Plummer, distinguished VP Analyst, chief of research, and Gartner Fellow.\n\nGartner predicts that spending on software will increase 14% to reach $1.23 trillion in 2025, up from 11.7% growth in 2024. Meanwhile, spending on IT services is expected to grow 9.4% to $1.73 trillion in 2025, up from 5.6% in 2024.\n\nHere are Gartner's top 10 strategic technology trends for 2025, led by agentic AI:\n\nAgentic AI - Agentic AI systems autonomously plan and take actions to meet user-defined goals. Agentic AI offers a virtual workforce that can offload and augment human work. Gartner predicts that, by 2028, at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be taken autonomously through agentic AI, up from 0% in 2024. The goal-driven capabilities of this technology will deliver more adaptable software systems, capable of completing a wide variety of tasks. AI Governance Platforms - AI governance platforms are a part of Gartner's evolving AI Trust, Risk and Security Management (TRiSM) framework that enables organizations to manage the legal, ethical, and operational performance of AI systems. These technology solutions can create, manage, and enforce policies for responsible AI use, explain how AI systems work, and provide transparency to build trust and accountability. Gartner predicts that by 2028, organizations that implement comprehensive AI governance platforms will experience 40% fewer AI-related ethical incidents compared to those without such systems. Disinformation Security - Disinformation security is an emerging technology category that systematically discerns trust and aims to provide methodological systems for ensuring integrity, assessing authenticity, preventing impersonation, and tracking the spread of harmful information. By 2028, Gartner predicts that 50% of enterprises will begin adopting products, services, or features designed specifically to address disinformation security use cases, up from less than 5% today.\n\nPostquantum Cryptography - Postquantum cryptography is data protection that resists quantum computing decryption risks. Analysts expect several types of conventional cryptography to end as quantum developments progress. Gartner predicts that advances in quantum computing will make most forms of asymmetric cryptography unsafe to use by 2029. The switch to postquantum cryptography methods is far from easy. Organizations must have a longer lead time to prepare robust protection of anything sensitive or confidential. Ambient Invisible Intelligence - Ambient invisible intelligence is enabled by ultra-low-cost smart tags and sensors that deliver large-scale affordable tracking and sensing. In the long term, ambient invisible intelligence will create a deeper integration of sensing and intelligence into everyday life. Through 2027, early examples of ambient invisible intelligence will focus on solving immediate problems, such as retail stock checking or perishable goods logistics, by enabling low-cost, real-time tracking and sensing of items to improve visibility and efficiency.\n\nEnergy-Efficient Computing - Compute-intensive applications, such as AI training, simulation, optimization, and media rendering, will be the biggest contributors to organizations' carbon footprint as they consume the most energy. New advances starting in the late 2020s will help to boost sustainability. Several new technologies, such as optical computing, neuromorphic computing, and novel accelerators, will emerge for special-purpose tasks such as AI and optimization. These technologies will use significantly less energy. Hybrid Computing - New computing paradigms continue to emerge, including central processing units, graphic processing units, edge computing, application-specific integrated circuits, neuromorphic computing, and classical quantum computing paradigms. Hybrid computing combines different compute, storage, and network mechanisms to solve computational problems.\n\nSpatial Computing - Spatial computing digitally enhances the physical world with technologies, such as augmented reality and virtual reality, and is the next level of interaction between experiences. The use of spatial computing will increase organizations' effectiveness in the next five to seven years through streamlined workflows and enhanced collaboration. By 2033, Gartner predicts spending on spatial computing will grow to $1.7 trillion, up from $110 billion in 2023. Polyfunctional Robots - Polyfunctional machines can do more than one task and are replacing task-specific robots that are custom-designed to perform a single task repeatedly. The functionality of these new robots improves efficiency and provides a faster return on investment. Polyfunctional robots are designed to operate alongside humans to support quicker deployment and easier scalability. Gartner predicts that 80% of humans will engage with smart robots daily by 2030, up from less than 10% today. Neurological Enhancement - Neurological enhancement improves human cognitive abilities using technologies that read and decode brain activity. This technology reads a person's brain using unidirectional brain-machine interfaces or bidirectional brain-machine interfaces (BBMIs). By 2030, Gartner predicts that 30% of knowledge workers will be enhanced by, and dependent on, technologies such as BBMIs (both employer and self-funded) to stay relevant due to the rise of AI in the workplace. This proportion represents a big rise from less than 1% in 2024.\n\n\n\nCIOs are the key to AI success\n\nCIOs and IT leaders were reminded of the importance of agentic AI during Gartner's Symposium. It was suggested the CIO role must expand to include responsibilities of the chief AI officer.\n\nIn an age of artificial intelligence (AI), chief information officers (CIO) must help stakeholders turbocharge their output.\n\nAlso: The secret to successful digital initiatives is pretty simple, according to Gartner\n\nThe role of the CIO now is much more than delivering access to trustworthy, relevant, timely, and impactful information -- these are table-stakes requirements.\n\nRecent Salesforce research, based on a survey of 150 CIOs of companies with more than 1,000 employees, also found that companies are looking for their CIOs to be AI experts.\n\nAlmost two-thirds (61%) of CIOs feel they're expected to know more about AI than they do, and their peers at other companies are their top sources of information.\n\nCIOs are now in the business of manufacturing intelligence and autonomous work. They are responsible for creating a work environment where humans and AI agents can collaborate and co-create stakeholder value.\n\nAlso: 4 ways generative AI can stimulate the economy\n\nDigital leaders must design, own, and deliver the roadmap to the autonomous enterprise. Maximizing enterprise performance with generative AI (gen AI) requires modernizing data foundations and measuring business outcomes.\n\nGartner's top strategic predictions for 2025 and beyond led with predictions focused on generative AI and agentic AI. Here are the analyst's key predictions for AI-specific future trends:\n\nThrough 2026, 20% of organizations will use AI to flatten their organizational structure, eliminating more than half of current middle management positions. Organizations that deploy AI to eliminate middle management human workers will be able to capitalize on reduced labor costs in the short-term and long-term benefits savings.\n\nBy 2029, 10% of global boards will use AI guidance to challenge executive decisions that are material to their business. AI-generated insights will have a far-reaching impact on executive decision-making and empower board members to challenge executive decisions.\n\nBy 2028, 40% of large enterprises will deploy AI to manipulate and measure employee mood and behavior. AI can perform sentiment analysis on workplace interactions and communications.\n\nBy 2027, 70% of new employee contracts will include licensing and fair usage clauses for AI representations of their personas. The large language models (LLMs) that emerge have no set end date, which means employees' personal data captured by enterprise LLMs will remain part of the model during employment and after.\n\nBy 2027, 70% of healthcare providers will include emotional-AI-related terms and conditions in technology contracts or risk billions in financial harm.\n\nBy 2028, 30% of S&P companies will use Gen AI labeling to reshape their branding and chase new revenue. CMOs view Gen AI as a tool that can help launch new products and business models.\n\nBy 2028, 25% of enterprise breaches will be traced back to AI agent abuse from external sources and malicious internal actors. AI agents will significantly increase the invisible attack surface at enterprises and new security and risk solutions will be necessary.\n\nBy 2028, 40% of CIOs will demand using \"Guardian Agents\" that are available to autonomously track, oversee, or contain the results of AI agent actions. Enterprises' interest in AI agents is growing, but as a new level of intelligence is added, new Gen AI agents are poised to expand rapidly in strategic planning for product leaders.\n\nThrough 2027, Fortune 500 companies will shift $500 billion from energy operational spending to microgrids to mitigate chronic energy risks and AI demand. Microgrids are power networks that connect generation, storage, and loads in an independent energy system that can operate on its own or with the main grid to meet the energy needs of a specific area or facility.\n\nAgentic AI will be the most important strategic technology for the next few years. Welcome to the age of agentic AI, where companies that grow and thrive will focus on the most important business currencies of trust, speed, scale, and personalization, while also dealing with the balance between automation and meaningful work."
