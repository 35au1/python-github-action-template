            "article_content": "Copilot+ PCs are the first PCs to run Small Language Models (SLM) on-device. It means these AI models are powered by local processing capabilities rather than relying on cloud, which is typically done by AIs like ChatGPT. This approach can result in faster responses as compared to the cloud-based Copilot or ChatGPT.\n\nNow, Microsoft has introduced AI Dev Gallery, which makes it easy to add on-device AI features to any app.\n\nThe AI Dev Gallery app is for developers who want to try multiple models to integrate an AI feature into their app. AI Dev Gallery has over 25 samples to download and run on Windows 10. Moreover, you can export the project or source code directly into your app and get it working instantly.\n\nIt works with Windows 10 and 11 and supports x64 and ARM64 architectures.\n\nOut of curiosity, Windows Latest cloned the AI Dev Gallery from its GitHub repository and compiled our own version of AI Dev Gallery.\n\nCurrently, the only way to access it is by building the project in Visual Studio and then running it. In addition, you\u2019ll need at least 20GB of space and a multi-core CPU. It also suggests a GPU with 8GB VRAM, but those are for heavy models only.\n\nWe started with a 4-core CPU, 4GB RAM, or a Windows 11 PC. The app has two modes: Sample and models. We used the sample view to check out all the available models.\n\nThe app categorizes them into Text, Image, Code, Audio and video, and Smart Controls.\n\nTesting the models\n\nModels for image generation and video generation need about 5GB of bandwidth to download and save it to your PC. To better understand how things work, we started with a small one related to image upscaling, which was under 100 MB.\n\nWe took a screenshot of the screen and tried to upscale it using the CPU. Note that you can switch between CPU and GPU for processing the request.\n\nThe upscaling happened in under 30 seconds in this inferior virtual machine, where the RAM usage increased to 1GB. As you can see in the screenshots below, App Gallery produced an upscaled version of the image with a 9272*4900 resolution.\n\nHowever, the 100MB upscale model has its own issues. While it used our local resources to upscale images, elements, especially text, were ruined. You can barely read the texts.\n\nThere\u2019s no option to preview this generated image in a bigger window or full-screen. Even the download option isn\u2019t there to save it to disk.\n\nWe tried another model called Detect Human Pose. It identifies someone\u2019s position in an image. While it accurately identified a basic walking person, it even started showing position marks for screenshots of our desktop with a few apps open.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how these models can be integrated into the app, but some of these features can be run locally. Of course, PCs will need bigger storage for these models and powerful CPUs with 16GB or more RAM.\n\nWhat do you think? It is worth downloading a 5GB model to convert a text prompt into an image or wait for 30 seconds to do that on a web app. Clearly, most of these features have very niche use cases and implementation environments rather than appealing to the whole Windows 11 user base."

            "article_content": "It's been a wild year in tech thanks to the intersection between humans and artificial intelligence. 2024 brought a parade of AI oddities, mishaps, and wacky moments that inspired odd behavior from both machines and man. From AI-generated rat genitals to search engines telling people to eat rocks, this year proved that AI has been having a weird impact on the world.\n\nWhy the weirdness? If we had to guess, it may be due to the novelty of it all. Generative AI and applications built upon Transformer-based AI models are still so new that people are throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. People have been struggling to grasp both the implications and potential applications of the new technology. Riding along with the hype, different types of AI that may end up being ill-advised, such as automated military targeting systems, have also been introduced.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that aside from crazy news, we saw fewer weird AI advances in 2024 as well. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet launched in June held off the competition as a top model for most of the year, while OpenAI's o1 used runtime compute to expand GPT-4o's capabilities with simulated reasoning. Advanced Voice Mode and NotebookLM also emerged as novel applications of AI tech, and the year saw the rise of more capable music synthesis models and also better AI video generators, including several from China.\n\nBut for now, let's get down to the weirdness.\n\nChatGPT goes insane\n\nCredit: Benj Edwards / Getty Images\n\nEarly in the year, things got off to an exciting start when OpenAI's ChatGPT experienced a significant technical malfunction that caused the AI model to generate increasingly incoherent responses, prompting users on Reddit to describe the system as \"having a stroke\" or \"going insane.\" During the glitch, ChatGPT's responses would begin normally but then deteriorate into nonsensical text, sometimes mimicking Shakespearean language.\n\nOpenAI later revealed that a bug in how the model processed language caused it to select the wrong words during text generation, leading to nonsense outputs (basically the text version of what we at Ars now call \"jabberwockies\"). The company fixed the issue within 24 hours, but the incident led to frustrations about the black box nature of commercial AI systems and users' tendency to anthropomorphize AI behavior when it malfunctions."

Even if you do know, it can be hard to get all the details while sifting through thousands of reviews or digging through product specs. Thankfully, Amazon's new AI helper, Rufus, can help streamline the process in many ways.\n\nRufus is Amazon's Helpful AI on the Amazon Mobile App\n\nRufus can help ease the burden of shopping online in many ways. It can answer specific questions about products, search Amazon for certain types of items, summarize pros and cons mentioned in product reviews, and more. For now, Rufus is only available on the Amazon mobile app, not their regular website. So if you want to take it for a spin, you'll need the app. Once the app has been installed, tap little orange and blue button in the bottom right corner of your mobile app to launch Rufus.\n\nThe funny thing is, Rufus can also do a lot of things it probably isn't supposed to do. Even though its purpose is to aid you with your shopping questions on Amazon, it can actually answer totally unrelated questions just like a normal chatbot. I've gotten it to give me estimates on the time required to drive from Boston to New York and even give general medical advice. That said, I wouldn't recommend using Rufus for that.\n\nA screenshot of the Amazon mobile app with a red arrow pointing towards the Rufus AI.\n\nYou'll be much better off playing to its strengths, using it to recommend clothing sizes, summarize product descriptions, and the like. That said, bear in mind that Rufus, like all generative AI, is not perfect. They can make mistakes and confidently present incorrect information. In my experience, Rufus tends to get most things right, but there have been a few cases where it messes up and doesn't even realize it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nI wouldn't take the word of Rufus on something so important that getting it wrong will ruin everything, but it's still a helpful tool. As for how exactly that tool can help you, there are many ways it can make your shopping experience simpler and more enjoyable.\n\nRequest Generated Summaries of Customer Reviews\n\nIf you're like me, you don't really trust product descriptions that hype up the item you're looking for. After all, a seller is trying to make money, so they aren't going to tell you about the shortcomings of their product, and they'll always do their best to make it sound awesome. This is where customer reviews come in: no one is more honest about their experience than a customer who is displeased with their purchase.\n\nThat said, it can take a lot of time to read through dozens or even hundreds of reviews, especially if you want to try and get the perspectives of both the one-star and the five-star reviews. Rufus can help you out with this. While on the product page for the item you are interested in, open up Rufus and ask it to summarize reviews. Usually, it will give you a fairly basic summary that points out commonly praised aspects of the item.\n\nA screenshot showing Amazon's Rufus AI summarizing reviews for a foot bath product.\n\nFor instance, I asked Rufus to summarize reviews for a vacuum cleaner, the Shark Navigator NV356E. The initial review summary was brief, mentioning that reviews commonly praised the light weight, strong suction power, and great maneuverability. To get a more robust summary, all I had to do was ask Rufus for more details. After that, it covered all sorts of things talked about in the reviews, including accessories, the dust cup, the self-cleaning brush roll, and more.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt's probably still worth it to check out the poor reviews for an item you are interested in, but using Rufus to get review summaries gives you a great initial impression of the product and what's good or bad about it. That said, how useful this is all depends on how much you trust the reviews left for the product in the first place.\n\nAsk Specific Questions About Product Specifications\n\nHave you ever had a tough time finding out whether or not a product has some niche feature you really care about? Whether or not the item is rechargeable, or if the hoodie you're looking at has a sherpa lining? Sometimes, that information is just buried in the description somewhere. Other times, it's seemingly not mentioned at all. Whatever the case, you can ask Rufus to find this information for you if need be.\n\nNow, Rufus can't pull up information that doesn't exist. For instance, there were a few hoodies I was looking at in which the product description didn't explicitly specify what fabric the lining was made of. Even if I ask Rufus, there is nothing for it to draw on. That said, if someone in the reviews mentions it, the AI helper can get an answer from there too.\n\nA screenshot showing Amazon's Rufus AI answering a specific question about a Nerf Gun.\n\nIf you search for a particular product or open up a product page and then go to Rufus, it will also automatically suggest some popular product questions asked by other people. For example, when I was looking at a flat-screen TV, Rufus recommended some popular questions, such as \"how intuitive is the smart platform to navigate\" and \"does it support Dolby Atmos audio format?\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThese suggestions are helpful, because sometimes you don't even know what you need to know about the product until you're prompted to ask the right questions. At any rate, Rufus is very helpful with providing answers to specific questions about products if you can't find the answer yourself. Just make sure you double-check the information if it's really important that it's absolutely right. After all, a lot of product reviews on Amazon are written by AI too, so that could lead to misinformation.\n\nGeneral Assistance Like Order Status, Product Categories, and More\n\nYou can also use Rufus to give you more general assistance while shopping on Amazon's mobile app. For instance, I've bought a couple of presents for my family this year, and it can be annoying to keep track of their order status: like whether they've shipped, their estimated delivery dates, or been canceled. All you have to do to get all that information is ask for order status with Rufus. If you're signed in to your account, that info will get pulled up swiftly.\n\nA screenshot showing Amazon's Rufus AI providing information about a user's order status.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRufus is also quite helpful if you don't have an exact product in mind, but you do know what type of product you want. I'm very particular about my hoodies, and I want them to have zippers and sherpa lining. I can mention those specific details to Rufus, and it'll pull up a variety of hoodies that meet my parameters. If I want to get more specific, I can tell Rufus to only show certain brands too.\n\nUsing Rufus like this is a pretty great way to generate ideas if you aren't sure exactly what you want. That said, you might have to put some work into your prompt to get the types of items you want, but the more specific you can get, the better your recommendations will be.\n\nEven after all of that, you can also talk to Rufus for general advice about products. You could ask about who a gift might be a good fit for, inquire about recipes, or even discuss how certain products might help you out with a home improvement project.\n\nThere are many ways this new AI helper on Amazon's mobile app can add value to your shopping experience. There's undoubtedly even more you could do than what I've talked about here today. Just remember that AI isn't infallible, and can sometimes make very convincing mistakes. After all, it's not really artificial intelligence, despite the name.\n\nBe sure to double-check its output when it's really important, and use it only as a helper, not a replacement for your own product vetting."

            "article_content": "Hubble Space Telescope image of galaxy NGC 5084's core. A dark, vertical line near the center shows the curve of a dusty disk orbiting the core, whose presence suggests a supermassive black hole within. The disk and black hole share the same orientation, fully tipped over from the horizontal orientation of the galaxy.\n\nProbing a distant galaxy like a \"cosmic crime scene\" with the Hubble Space Telescope after a \"tip-off\" from the Chandra X-ray telescope, NASA scientists have discovered a strange black hole that is tipped onto its side.\n\nThe sideways black hole was discovered in the galaxy NGC 5084, a lenticular (lens-shaped) galaxy located around 80 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of Virgo. The black hole rotates in an unexpected direction in relation to its surrounding galaxy.\n\nThe team was tipped off to the existence of this black hole when they discovered two plumes of plasma, one that extends above and below the plane of the galaxy and one that stretches through the galaxy, crossing each other and making an \"X\" shape. This galactic structure is something astronomers have never seen before.\n\n\"Detecting two pairs of X-ray plumes in one galaxy is exceptional,\" team member and Ames Research Center astrophysicist Pamela Marcum said in a statement . \"The combination of their unusual, cross-shaped structure and the 'tipped-over,' dusty disk gives us unique insights into this galaxy's history.\"\n\nThe scientists behind the discovery think that a dramatic event in the history of NGC 5084 may be responsible for knocking this black hole over on its side like a \"cosmic hit and run.\"\n\nX marks the WHAT?\n\nThe team made the discovery in archival data from Chandra thanks to a new image analysis they developed. This technique, \"Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal\" or \"SAUNAS,\" teases out low-brightness X-ray emissions from NASA's powerful X-ray space telescope, revealing the strange X-shaped twin plasma plumes.\n\nThis was odd because when astronomers see X-rays emitted from massive galaxies, they expect to find them evenly spread out. This homogeneity would result in a sphere of high-energy light. The sight of a concentrated shape of X-rays indicates a dramatic event in the history of a galaxy.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

They did this by scouring the archives of other telescopes and with new observations from two powerful ground-based observatories.\n\nAn illustration shows a supermassive black tilted on its side (Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nObservations from Hubble backed by data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) , 66 radio antennas based in northern Chile, showed a dusty ring of material at the heart of NGC 5084, turning on its side. This indicated not only a black hole lurking at the center of this galaxy but that object was bizarrely rotated at a 90-degree angle to NGC 5084.\n\nThe follow-up examinations of NGC 5084 helped the team see this galaxy and its sideways black hole across a wide range of light wavelengths.\n\n\"It was like seeing a crime scene with multiple types of light,\" team leader and Ames Research Center scientist Alejandro Serrano Borlaff said in a statement. \u201cPutting all the pictures together revealed that NGC 5084 has changed a lot in its recent past.\"\n\nSo what \"crime\" does the team suspect has taken place in NGC 5084 and knocked over this black hole?\n\n\n\nCurrently, the \"prime suspect\" in this cosmic whodunnit is a collision with another galaxy that generated a \"chimney\" of plasma that erupted from the top and bottom of NGC 5084's plane.\n\nThough more investigations of NGC 5084 will be needed to properly determine the violent event that sculpted its strange structure, this research demonstrates the power of archival data, even dating back as far as three decades, to help scientists make new and unique discoveries.\n\nThis data is especially powerful when coupled with an innovative processing technique, such as that developed by Borlaff and colleagues.\n\nThe team's research was published Dec. 18 in the Astrophysical Journal ."

            "article_content": "Former OpenAI employee Suchir Balaji alleged the startup violates copyright laws.\n\nHis death in November reignited a debate about how top AI companies affect humanity.\n\nIn an interview with BI, Balaji's mom shared his initial hopes for AI, and why they were dashed.\n\nIn October, Suchir Balaji made waves when he spoke against OpenAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, he discussed how powerhouse AI companies might be breaking copyright laws.\n\nOpenAI's models are trained on information from the internet. Balaji helped collect and organize that data, but he grew to feel the practice was unfair. He resigned in August. And in November, he was named by NYT lawyers as someone who might have \"unique and relevant documents\" for their copyright-infringement case against OpenAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave,\" he told the Times.\n\nOn November 26, the young engineer was found dead in his apartment. The tragedy struck a chord, stoking conspiracy theories, grief, and debate. What do we lose when AI models gain?\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Business Insider, Balaji's mother, Poornima Ramarao, offered clues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBalaji joined OpenAI because of AI's potential to do good, she said. Early on, he loved that the models were open-source, meaning freely available for others to use and study. As the company became more financially driven and ChatGPT launched, those hopes faded. Balaji went from believing in the mission to fearing its consequences for publishers and society as a whole, she told BI.\n\n\"He felt AI is a harm to humanity,\" Ramarao said.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson shared that Balaji was a valued member of the team, and that his passing deeply affected those who worked closely with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We were devastated to learn of this tragic news and have been in touch with Suchir's family to offer our full support during this difficult time,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement. \"Our priority is to continue to do everything we can to assist them.\"\n\n\"We first became aware of his concerns when The New York Times published his comments and we have no record of any further interaction with him,\" OpenAI's spokesperson added. \"We respect his, and others', right to share views freely. Our hearts go out to Suchir's loved ones, and we extend our deepest condolences to all who are mourning his loss.\"\n\nRecruited by OpenAI\n\nGrowing up, Balaji's dad thought he was \"more than average,\" Ramarao said. But she thought her son was a prodigy. By two years old, he could form complex sentences, she recalled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"As a toddler, as a little 5-year-old, he never made mistakes. He was perfect,\" Ramarao said.\n\nAt age 11, he started learning to code using Scratch, a programming language geared toward kids. Soon, he was asking his mom, who's a software engineer, questions that went over her head. At 13, he built his own computer. At 14, he wrote a science paper about chip design.\n\n\"Dad would say, don't focus too much. Don't push him too much,\" Ramarao said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuchir Balaji and his mom, Poornima Ramarao. Poornima Ramarao\n\nThey moved school districts to find him more challenges. His senior year, he was the US champion in a national programming contest for high-schoolers, leading to him getting recruited, at 17 years old, by Quora, the popular online knowledge-sharing forum. His mom was against it, so he fibbed to her about applying. But he had to fess up by the first day on the job because he couldn't drive yet.\n\n\"I had to give him a ride to his office in Mountain View,\" Ramarao said.\n\nShe was worried about how he'd handle \"so many adults,\" but he made friends to play poker with and enjoyed Quora's abundant cafeteria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe viewed it as a lesson in learning to trust her Balaji.\n\n\"Then I understood, okay, my son is really an advanced person. I cannot be a hindrance to him,\" Ramarao said.\n\nAfter working for about a year, he went to UC Berkeley, and soon won $100,000 in a TSA-sponsored challenge to improve their passenger-screening algorithms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was all enough to be recruited by OpenAI. He interned with the company in 2018, per his LinkedIn, then joined full-time in 2021 after graduating.\n\nAn early standout\n\nSuchir Balaji on vacation before his death. Poornima Ramarao\n\nOver his nearly four-year tenure at OpenAI, Balaji became a standout, eventually making significant contributions to ChatGPT's training methods and infrastructure, John Schulman, an OpenAI cofounder, wrote in a social media post about Balaji.\n\n\"He'd think through the details of things carefully and rigorously. And he also had a slight contrarian streak that made him allergic to 'groupthink' and eager to find where the consensus was wrong,\" Schulman said in the post. Schulman didn't reply to BI's requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBalaji had joined the company at a critical juncture, though.\n\nOpenAI started off as a non-profit in 2015 with the explicit mission of ensuring that AI benefited all of humanity. As the startup moved away from its open-source and non-profit roots, Balaji became more concerned, Ramarao said.\n\nWhen it launched ChatGPT publicly in November 2022, he reconsidered the copyright implications, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier that year, a big part of Balaji's role was gathering digital data \u2014 from all corners of the English-speaking internet \u2014 for GPT-4, a model that would soon power ChatGPT, per the Times interview. Balaji thought of this like a research project.\n\nUsing other people's data for research was one thing, he wrote in a later essay. Using it to make a product that could take away from those creators' revenue or traffic was another.\n\nOpenAI didn't comment on Balaji's concerns to Business Insider. In court, it has argued that the legal doctrine of \"fair use\" protects how its models ingest publicly-available internet content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Too naive and too innocent\"\n\nBy late 2023 and early 2024, Balaji's enthusiasm for OpenAI had fizzled out entirely, and he began to criticize CEO Sam Altman in conversations with friends and family, Ramarao said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHe used to tell his mom when he was working on \"something cool,\" but more and more, he had nothing to say about his job, she told BI.\n\nWhen he resigned in August, Ramarao didn't press the issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCome October, when she saw his bombshell interview with the Times, she unleashed a torrent of anxiety at Balaji. In shining a spotlight on what he thought was corporate wrongdoing, he was taking it all on his shoulders, she said.\n\n\"I literally blasted him,\" she said of their conversation. \"'You should not go alone. Why did you give your picture? Why did you give your name? Why don't you stay anonymous? What's the need for you to give your picture?'\"\n\n\"You have to go as a group. You have to go together with other people who are like-minded. Then he said, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm connecting with like-minded people. I'm building a team,'\" she continued. \"I think he was too naive and too innocent to understand this dirty corporate world.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBalaji's parents are calling for an investigation\n\nWhen Balaji left OpenAI in August, he took a break.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"He said, 'I'm not taking up another job. Don't ask me,'\" Ramarao said.\n\nFrom Balaji's parents' vantage point, everything seemed fine with the young coder. He was financially stable, with enough OpenAI stock to buy a house one day, she said. He had plans to build a machine learning non-profit in the medical field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He wanted to do something for society,\" his mom said.\n\nOn November 21, a Thursday, Balaji celebrated his 26th birthday with friends while on vacation. The next day, he let his mom know when his flight home took off, and spoke with his dad on the phone before dinner. His dad wished him a happy birthday and said he was sending a gift.\n\nSuchir Balaji with friends on vacation. Poornima Ramarao\n\nAccording to Ramarao, the medical examiner said that Balaji died that evening, or possibly the next morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He was upbeat and happy,\" she said. \"What can go wrong within a few hours that his life is lost?\"\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, Ramarao didn't hear from her son. She thought that maybe he'd lost his phone or gone for a hike. But on Monday, she went and knocked on his door. He didn't answer. She thought about filing a missing person complaint. But, knowing he'd have to go in-person to remove it, she hesitated. \"He'll get mad at me,\" she said of her thinking at the time.\n\nThe next morning, she called the San Francisco police. They found his body just after 1 p.m. PST, according to a spokesperson for the department. But Ramarao wasn't told or allowed inside, she said. As officers trickled in, she pleaded with them to check if his laptop and toothbrush were missing, she told BI; that way she'd know if he'd traveled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They didn't give the news to me,\" Ramaro said. \"I'm still sitting there thinking, 'My son is traveling. He's gone somewhere.' It's such a pathetic moment.\"\n\nAround 2 p.m., they told her to go home. She refused.\n\n\"I sat there firmly,\" Ramarao told BI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, around 3:20 p.m., a long white van pulled up with the light on.\n\n\"I was waiting to see medical help or nurses or someone coming out of the van,\" she said. \"But a stretcher came. A simple stretcher. I ran and asked the person. He said, 'We have a dead body in that apartment.'\"\n\nAbout an hour later, a medical examiner and police asked to speak with Ramarao one-on-one inside the apartment's office. They said that Balaji had died by suicide, and that from looking at CCTV footage, he was alone, according to Ramarao. There was no initial evidence of foul play, the department spokesperson told BI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBalaji's parents aren't convinced. They arranged for a private autopsy, completed in early December. Ramarao said the results were atypical, but she declined to share any more details. BI has not seen a copy of the report.\n\nBalaji's parents are working with an attorney to press the SF police to reopen the case and do a \"proper investigation,\" Ramarao said.\n\nMeanwhile, they and members of their community are trying to raise awareness of his case through social media and a Change.org petition. Besides seeking answers, they want to invoke a broader discussion about whistleblowers' vulnerability and lack of protections, Ramarao and a family friend, who's helping organize a an event about Balaji on December 27, told BI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We want to leave the question open,\" Ramarao said. \"It doesn't look like a normal situation.\"\n\nBI shared a detailed account of Ramarao's concerns and memory of November 26 with spokespeople for the SF police and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. These officials did not respond or offer comments.\n\nRamarao emphasized to BI that the family isn't pointing fingers at OpenAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuchir Balaji with his parents. Poornima Ramarao\n\n'Yes, mom'\n\nRamarao said she shared a close bond with her son. He didn't eat enough fruit, so every time she visited, she'd arrange shipments to his apartment from Costco. He tended to skip breakfast, so she'd bring granola bars and cookies.\n\nBalaji rarely expressed his emotions and always paid for everything. But on November 7, during their last meal together, something made Ramarao try extra hard to pay, give him a ride home, and seek reassurance. He still paid for the meal and called an Uber. But he did offer his mom two words of encouragement.\n\n\"I asked him, 'Suchir this is the hardship. This is how I raised you, and if you were to choose parents now, would you choose me as mom?' He didn't think for a second,'\" she said. \"'Yes, mom.' And you know what? As a mother, that will keep me going as long as I'm alive.\""

Elon Musk, who cofounded the company but left the board in 2018, filed a lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI in February. Musk withdrew the lawsuit in June but filed a new lawsuit in August in which he argued that OpenAI executives \"deceived\" him into cofounding the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid its legal challenges, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in funding in October \u2014 a record-high funding round for tech in Silicon Valley \u2014 pushing the company's valuation to $157 billion.\n\nNow, Altman is looking at what's in store for the new year, and he's crowdsourcing ideas on how to continue advancing and improving not just ChatGPT but all of the company's existing and emerging products.\n\nHere are three ideas Altman appears to be eyeing so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamily accounts\n\nOne X follower responded to Altman's post with a suggestion to allow OpenAI users to create accounts for families that include guardrails, allowing kids to use the platform safely.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Let their curiosity take off, but within reasonable limits, as determined by the parent,\" the user wrote, to which Altman responded: \"this is a good idea!\"\n\nOpenAI's website states that ChatGPT isn't meant for children under 13 and requires parental consent for children ages 13 to 18 to use the platform, but does not actively verify the consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImprovements to voice chats\n\nChatGPT developed a voice feature that allows users to speak directly to the chatbot. One of Altman's followers suggested that the feature be improved because, as of now, per the user, \"you can't just silently think for 5 seconds without being interrupted.\"\n\nAltman wrote that that's a \"good point.\" Users have struggled with the feature since it was rolled out, with some having reported bugs and misinterpretations from the chatbot.\n\nBetter video generation\n\nMultiple users urged Altman to improve Sora, OpenAI's text-to-video model. Sora allows users to describe a video they want the platform to create with a written prompt, which Sora will generate based on the text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSora officially launched on December 9 after being piloted to a limited group of creators in February. Rohan Sahai, Sora's product lead, said at the launch that the product would begin more conservatively because its team wants to prevent illegal activity like copyright violations while allowing for creative expression.\n\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider."

As reported by The Information, OpenAI plans to enter the humanoid robot sector. Reportedly, the company has been in discussions about bringing humanoid robots. Let\u2019s have a look at what big plans it has ahead of 2024.\n\nOpenAI to bring humanoid robot\n\nUntil 2021 OpenAI had a specific division for robots. However, it had to shut down the division as it decided to focus more on artificial intelligence software. The confirmation was made by Wojciech Zaremba, the leader of that division during that time. He announced in a podcast that the team gave up on it because they couldn\u2019t train something according to the desired intelligence level.\n\nBut now back to 2024, the company again plans to make a fresh start and step into this sector. Some other reports suggest that OpenAI also aims to collaborate with TSMC and Broadcom. The aim is to develop their first in-house chip to support its artificial intelligence systems.\n\nThe future plans\n\nLooking forward,OpenAI has also been investing in robotic startups. The list includes Physical Intelligence, Figure AI and 1X Technologies. These startups have been working on building humanoid robots and developing artificial general intelligence or AGI.\n\nIn addition to this, OpenAI is also planning to develop its reasoning model and an AI agent. These will be designed to \u2018help automate all manner of software engineering and analysis tasks\u2019. However, as of now no official announcement has been made about these plans.\n\nWell, OpenAI is not the only one to make its mark in the humanoid robot space. Already there are other players existing. For example, you have the Tesla Bot named Optimus, and Atlas by Boston Dynamics. Looks like OpenAI also wants to enter the market and compete in this space."

The ChatGPT o1 models and the Canvas mode came out of beta, and ChatGPT Search is now available to users on the free tier. OpenAI also released Sora to the public and unveiled ChatGPT o3, the next-gen reasoning model.\n\nWe also got a 1-800 ChatGPT number that lets you call the AI from landlines and text it from WhatsApp and an update to the Mac app that lets you use the AI with more coding and texting apps.\n\nOpenAI didn\u2019t announce the mythical GPT-5 model in 2024, which has supposedly been in the works for more than a year. Also known as Orion, the model has encountered development issues, which explain the launch delays. That\u2019s what reports say about GPT-5, at least.\n\nHowever, we can expect several upgrades across all of OpenAI\u2019s products, including ChatGPT, in 2025. Sam Altman teased some of them after asking ChatGPT users what they\u2019d want to see from OpenAI next year.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\n\u201cWhat would you like openai to build/fix in 2025?\u201d the CEO asked on X on Christmas Day. Unsurprisingly, plenty of people provided useful suggestions, aside from the obvious AGI and GPT-5 answers one could easily throw at Altman. The CEO addressed some of them, teasing the kind of ChatGPT features and upgrades coming next year.\n\nFamily accounts\n\nOne X user asked for ChatGPT family accounts, a feature request I also subscribe to. Sam Altman said it was a good idea.\n\nthis is a good idea! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nBetter Advanced Voice Mode chats\n\nA different person wants ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode to have better memory so it can recall previous text and voice conversations.\n\nreally want to figure this one out! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nA ChatGPT user asked for better turn detection in Advanced Voice Mode so you can think silently for 5 seconds without interruptions.\n\ngood point \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nA \u201cgrown-up\u201d ChatGPT mode\n\nWhile a ChatGPT mode for kids would require additional protections, an X user asked for a \u201cgrown-up\u201d version that would lose the existing guardrails. Needless to say, no AI company will remove guardrails from its models, but Alman said that ChatGPT does need a \u201cgrown-up mode.\u201d\n\ndefinitely need some sort of \u201cgrown up mode\u201d \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nAI models interoperability\n\nSomeone wants a new ChatGPT UI that supports drag-and-drop so you can combine different chats and models for improved responses. Altman called it an \u201cinteresting\u201d idea that he hadn\u2019t thought of.\n\nthis is an interesting idea i haven\u2019t really thought about before! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nChatGPT AI agents\n\nThe ChatGPT app for macOS is the closest thing we have to ChatGPT AI agents, but it\u2019s not quite that. Rumors say OpenAI is working on AI agents in addition to GPT-5. Someone asked for proper agents for 2025, to which Altman responded with, \u201cHappy 2025!\u201d I see that as a teaser that AI agents are coming to ChatGPT next.\n\nhappy 2025! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nA good base ChatGPT model\n\nAltman also agreed with someone\u2019s suggestion that ChatGPT needs a better base non-thinking model., as \u201cGPT-4o kinda sucks right now.\u201d\n\ndefinitely \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nRegarding GPT-4o, someone asked for image generation support, with Altman saying he hoped it\u2019s coming.\n\nhope to! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nA better Sora\n\nOpenAI has just released the text-to-video generator, but some users have already requested improvements.

Altman said it was a \u201cvery good list,\u201d and that users will hopefully be \u201cquite happy\u201d with ChatGPT next year.\n\nvery good list! hopefully you\u2019ll be quite happy with us next year overall \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nAltman also addressed suggestions about ChatGPT getting a bigger context limit, larger rate limits, and cheaper prices. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that OpenAI will actually be able to offer these next year.\n\nrate limits up, context up, and costs down! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nWhat about ChatGPT hardware?\n\nWe know OpenAI has partnered with Jony Ive to manufacture a mysterious ChatGPT hardware device. We have no idea when it\u2019s coming, but an X user suggested it for 2025 as an \u201cunexpected\u201d announcement. Here\u2019s how Altman responded to it:\n\n\ud83d\udc40 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nThe list of suggested ChatGPT features for 2025 includes other tidbits. Altman might be reacting to all of it. However, the \u201chardware play\u201d suggestion is enough to warrant the response above. Even if the ChatGPT hardware will be unveiled next year, and there\u2019s no indication it will be, Altman would probably avoid addressing it this early."

            "article_content": "Despite investing $13.75 billion in OpenAI since 2019, Microsoft is reportedly exploring alternatives to the ChatGPT maker\u2019s AI model, particularly for its 365 Copilot \u2013 an AI tool designed to assist with creating documents, presentations, spreadsheets, notes, emails, and more. The move is believed to be part of the tech giant\u2019s effort to diversify its AI dependency and cut costs, according to a report by Reuters, citing people familiar with the development.\n\nLaunched in 2023, Microsoft 365 Copilot \u2013 which also got a \u2018voice\u2019 this year, named Copilot Voice \u2013 aggressively highlighted the use of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model in its early days. But now the scenario seems to be changing, possibly due to three main reasons: first, to avoid monopoly or exclusive dependency; second, to reduce costs; and third, to improve speed. Yes, the report suggests that the \u2018speed improvement\u2019 is also a factor that led Microsoft down this path.\n\nGoing forward, we could see Microsoft achieve its goals by integrating internal and third-party artificial intelligence models into 365 Copilot, which has over 28 million active users across Windows, apps, and websites as of November 2024. This is notable, as just a few weeks ago, Microsoft officially unveiled the latest iteration in its Phi series of generative AI models \u2013 Phi-4. With approximately 14 billion parameters, Phi-4 is claimed to be a compact yet powerful model, noted for its excellence in specialized tasks such as mathematical reasoning.\n\nTo this date, Microsoft has invested over $20 billion into the artificial intelligence segment, with a major chunk of it going to OpenAI alone. Priced at $30 per user per month, the AI-powered 365 Copilot is expected to see significant growth in both its user base and revenue. According to a forecast by Macquarie, Microsoft could generate approximately $7.3 billion in incremental annual recurring revenue (ARR) from 365 Copilot by the end of FY\u201925 (June), based on an estimated initial uptake of 5%, or about 20 million users. By FY\u201926, the portfolio of Copilot products is expected to generate $9.1 billion in revenue.\n\nSpeaking about OpenAI\u2014which triggered the AI race with its chatbot ChatGPT\u2014it now appears to be expanding further in the AI sector, reportedly planning to develop a full-fledged humanoid robot. The company has also recently announced its new generation of reasoning models \u2013 \u2018o3\u2019, which are claimed to be approaching \u2018AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).\n\nThe development also comes just days after reports emerged suggesting that Google urged the U.S. trade regulator, the FTC, to end Microsoft\u2019s exclusive agreement to host OpenAI\u2019s AI technologies on its cloud, including its chatbot, ChatGPT."

            "article_content": "The bill tabled on 19 November by Ugo Bernalicis, a member of the left-wing party France Unbowed (La France insoumise, LFI), to remove the incrimination of \"apology for terrorism\" from the penal code has sparked a fierce controversy in the country.\n\nThis provision has, in fact, been widely used since 7 October 2023 to criminalise statements of support for the Palestinians.\n\nCritics immediately went wild. \"It must be fought with the greatest force,\" declared Justice Minister Didier Migaud. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was outraged, saying: \"It is difficult to do [anything] more despicable.\"\n\nEven within the ranks of the Socialist Party (Parti socialist, PS), an ally of France Unbowed, regional elected official Carole Delga denounced a \"moral failure in the face of the victims of terrorism and the bereaved families\".\n\nThe less severe commentators criticised LFI for a justified but solitary and poorly worded initiative. However, no political leader and few TV debate hosts considered it necessary and legitimate to address the substance of the subject.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nLFI MP Manuel Bompard commented by saying that he was \"flabbergasted by the Trumpification of the debate\" and \"the intellectual laziness of the media class\".\n\nThe intent of the bill was not simply to repeal the criminal offence of apology for terrorism but to return it to the press law, from which it had been taken and integrated into the penal code by legislation adopted on 13 November 2014.\n\nThe urgent need at the time was to counter the propaganda of organisations claiming to be part of the so-called \"international jihad\" in the context of the proclamation of a caliphate by the Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq in June 2014.\n\nThe group\u2019s propaganda aimed to seduce young Europeans by glorifying its fighters, with the goal of enlisting them or mobilising them to commit attacks in Europe. The press law was totally unsuitable for facing this phenomenon.\n\nThe point of the 2014 legal change was mainly to lift the constraints that slowed down investigations, authorise pretrial detentions and immediate court appearances, allow for evidence seizures, and mobilise anti-terrorism surveillance resources.\n\nIn the traumatic, if not hysterical, atmosphere generated in France by the January and November 2015 attacks, the number of reports - encouraged by the government - for comments made on social media, in the workplace or even at school increased from 1,500 to 35,000 in one year.\n\nCriminalisation of simple comments\n\nBut since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October last year, the use of the qualification of apology for terrorism has experienced a new surge.\n\nAs early as 10 October, then-Justice Minister Eric Dupont-Moretti instructed prosecutors to pursue \"public remarks praising [these] attacks, presenting them as legitimate resistance to Israel, or the public propagation of messages inciting a favourable judgment on Hamas or Islamic Jihad because of the attacks they organised\".\n\nHundreds of investigations have been launched. By the end of January 2024, Le Monde counted 626 such enquiries targeting ordinary citizens, influencers, students, members of civil society organisations, union activists, journalists, academics (such as Francois Burgat), political leaders, local elected officials and even two LFI high-profile members: MP Mathilde Panot and future MEP Rima Hassan.\n\nThe vast majority of French political, media and intellectual elites have integrated the Israeli narrative. Those who deviate from it are treated as heretics, either \"antisemitic Islamists\" or \"collaborators\"\n\nFor having equated Hamas\u2019 \"heroic\" action to an act of \"resistance\", an activist was sentenced to pay \u20ac3,000 ($3,120) in damages to Jewish organisations that filed a civil suit against him. He was also added to the national register of terrorist offences perpetrators, FIJAIT, for 10 years, requiring him to report his home address every three months and notify authorities of any international travel at least two weeks in advance.\n\nAmong the most emblematic cases was that of a union leader, Jean-Paul Delescaut, sentenced in April to a one-year suspended prison sentence for a leaflet published by his organisation which stated that \u201cthe horrors of the illegal occupation have accumulated. Since Saturday, they have been receiving the responses they provoked\u201d.\n\nThe mere reminder of the historical context was considered a justification, as it failed to express sufficient moral disapproval, according to the terms of the judgment.\n\nPeople with Arab-sounding names have particularly aroused suspicion and police have paid a lot of attention to signs of religious practice, as though such practices indicate a predisposition to terrorism - reducing the conflict to a confessional clash devoid of any political rationality.\n\nWarnings ignored\n\nCritics of the legislation proposed by LFI have deliberately ignored years of warnings issued by various authoritative human rights organisations about France's apology for terrorism law.\n\nIn 2017, ombudsman Jacques Toubon expressed his deep concern for \"a vagueness incompatible with freedom of expression and information\" and warned against the \u201ctargeting of a section of the population\" (ie Muslims).\n\nIn a report issued in May 2019, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism highlighted \u201cthe weighty effects of the offence of \u2018apology for terrorism\u2019 on the right to freedom of expression\".\n\nFrance's 'apology for terrorism' law used to 'criminalise' Palestine solidarity Read More \u00bb\n\nThe report stated: \"The law is broadly drafted, engaging significant legal uncertainty, enabling discretionary overreach and affecting the protection of free expression and the open exchange of ideas in a robust democracy.\"\n\nMore recently, in April, the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (CNCDH) explained to the justice minister that its circular \"may have generated confusion between approval, praise of a crime and/or criminals, and stances relating to the context in which they were committed. The latter are part of a debate of ideas and should therefore be able to enjoy freedom of expression\".\n\nEven a former anti-terrorist judge, Marc Trevidic, who had recommended the inclusion of the apology for terrorism offence in the penal code at the time, denounced\"a totally perverted use of the law\" last October.\n\n\"A simple tag in support of Palestine makes you risk prison,\" he wrote, calling for \"a U-turn\".\n\nJudges as guardians of dogma\n\nIn such an atmosphere, the LFI bill has little chance of being included on the parliamentary agenda. On the other hand, the irrational fury it has triggered says a lot about the evolution of the public debate in France.\n\nThe time when Jean-Paul Sartre could say, the day after the hostage-taking of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games by the Black September organisation, that \"the Palestinians have no other choice for lack of weapons, defenders than to resort to terrorism\" seems far removed from today.\n\nBy granting immunity to Netanyahu, France is fuelling the genocide Read More \u00bb\n\nThe philosopher\u2019s statement, while not consensual, resonated with the still vivid historical memory of national liberation struggles.\n\nOne may even think that if two former presidents, Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou, were alive in our time, they could have been targeted by a denunciation for the apology for terrorism. In November 1967, Charles de Gaulle declared: \u201cIsrael is setting up in the territories it has captured an occupation that will inevitably involve oppression, repression and expulsions, and a resistance to this occupation is forming, which Israel in turn classes as terrorism.\u201d\n\nAfter the Munich events, Pompidou said: \"We will not eliminate Palestinian terrorism if we do not have some kind of solution to the Palestinian problem.\"\n\nSince 11 September 2001, the US \"war on terror\" rhetoric has progressively globalised the definition of terrorism as the figure of absolute evil, abstracted from any historical context, for which only the perpetrator bears responsibility.\n\nThe attacks committed on European soil by IS have allowed Israeli leaders to popularise their narrative of terrorism as a global threat against the West and an ideology carried by political Islam - or even by Muslims as a whole.\n\nTherefore, any attempt to rationally explain its causes is regarded as a reprehensible way of justifying it. Faced with this vital danger, only the use of limitless violence is seen as the legitimate response.\n\nThe vast majority of French political, media and intellectual elites have integrated the Israeli narrative into the republican orthodoxy. Those who deviate from it are treated as heretics, if not \u201cinner enemies\u201d, labelled either \"antisemitic Islamists\" or \"collaborators\" - a term loaded with historical significance in France, where it was used to describe Nazi allies during the occupation from 1940 to 1945.\n\nJudges, contrary to their traditional calling as \"guardians of freedoms\", are set to become the guardians of dogma. Contrary to Clausewitz's adage, according to which war is the continuation of politics by other means, in France, the law - or rather, the political use of the law - has become the prolongation of war in the realm of public opinion.\n\nThe same trend is at work in Germany and the United States. The war waged by Israel is accelerating the authoritarian and xenophobic drift of the states that support it.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents OpenAI releases GPT-4o Advanced Voice Mode helps computers speak like humans Generative AI comes to the edge The resurgence of nuclear power production Agents are poised to be the next big thing in generative AI The rise of reasoning models AI-empowered search spreads across the internet Anthropic\u2019s Artifact kicks off a collaborative revolution Image and video generators finally figure out fingers Elon Musk\u2019s $10 billion effort to build the world\u2019s biggest AI training cluster\n\nWe\u2019ve officially passed the second anniversary of the start of the AI boom, and things haven\u2019t slowed down. Just the opposite. Generative AI is ramping up at a pace that feels nearly overwhelming, expanding into new platforms, mediums, and even devices at a relentless pace.\n\nHere are the 10 announcements that made 2024 a monumental year in the world of AI.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nOpenAI releases GPT-4o\n\nWhen ChatGPT (running GPT-3.5) first arrived in November 2022, it was basically a fancy, computer-controlled game of Mad Libs. Don\u2019t get me wrong, even that capability was revolutionary at the time, but it wasn\u2019t until the release of GPT-4o in May 2024 that generative AI systems truly came into their own.\n\nBuilding on its predecessor\u2019s ability to analyze and generate both text and images, GPT-4o provides a more comprehensive contextual understanding compared to GPT-4 alone. This translates to better performance in everything from image captioning and visual analysis, to generating both creative and analytical content like graphs, charts, and images.\n\nAdvanced Voice Mode helps computers speak like humans\n\nIn September, OpenAI once again showed why it is the leading artificial intelligence firm by releasing its Advanced Voice Mode to ChatGPT subscribers. This feature eliminated the need for users to type their questions into a prompt window, instead enabling them to converse with the AI as they would another person.\n\nLeveraging GPT-4o\u2019s human-equivalent response times, Advanced Voice Mode fundamentally changed how people can interact with machine intelligence and helped users unleash the AI\u2019s full creative capacity.\n\nGenerative AI comes to the edge\n\nWhen ChatGPT debuted in 2022, it was the only AI in town and available in precisely one place: ChatGPT.com. Oh, what a difference two years makes. These days, you can find generative AI in everything from smartphones and smart home devices to autonomous vehicles and health-monitoring gadgets. ChatGPT, for example, is available as a desktop app, an API, a mobile app, and even via an 800 number. Microsoft, for its part, has integrated AI directly into its line of Copilot+ laptops.\n\nPerhaps the most significant example, of course, is Apple Intelligence. It might not have been the most successful launch (many of the features we are still waiting for), but in terms of making the powers of generative AI as accessible as possible, nothing was as important as Apple Intelligence.\n\nNow, neither Copilot+ PCs or Apple Intelligence panned out how the companies involved probably wanted \u2014 especially for Microsoft \u2014 but as we all know, this is only the beginning.\n\nThe resurgence of nuclear power production\n\nBefore this year, nuclear power was seen as a losing proposition in America. Deemed unreliable and unsafe, due in large part to the Three Mile Island incident of 1979 in which one of the plant\u2019s primary reactors partially melted down and spewed toxic, radioactive material into the atmosphere. However, with the rapidly increasing amounts of electrical power that modern large language models require \u2014 and the massive stress they place on regional power grids \u2014 many leading AI firms are taking a closer look at running their data centers using the power of the atom.\n\nAmazon, for example, purchased a nuclear-powered AI data center from Talen in March, then signed an agreement to acquire miniaturized, self-contained Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) from Energy Northwest in October. Microsoft, not to be outdone, has purchased the production capacity of Three Mile Island itself and is currently working to get Reactor One back online and generating electricity.\n\nAgents are poised to be the next big thing in generative AI\n\nTurns out, there\u2019s only so much training data, power, and water you can throw at the task of growing your large language model until you run into the issue of diminishing returns. The AI industry experienced this firsthand in 2024 and, in response, has begun to pivot away from the massive LLMs that originally defined the generative AI experience in favor of Agents; smaller, more responsive models designed to perform specific tasks, rather than try to do everything a user might ask of it.\n\nAnthropic debuted its agent, dubbed Computer Use, in October. Microsoft followed suit with Copilot Actions in November, while OpenAI is reportedly set to release its agent feature in January.\n\nThe rise of reasoning models\n\nMany of today\u2019s large language models are geared more toward generating responses as quickly as possible, often at the expense of accuracy and correctness. OpenAI\u2019s o1 reasoning model, which the company released as a preview in September and as a fully functional model in December, takes the opposite approach: It sacrifices response speed to internally verify its rationale for a given answer, ensuring that it is as accurate and complete as possible.\n\nWhile this technology has yet to be fully embraced by the public (o1 is currently only available to Plus and Pro tier subscribers), leading AI companies are pressing ahead with versions of their own. Google announced its answer to o1, dubbed Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, on December 19, while OpenAI revealed that it is already working on o1\u2019s successor, which it calls o3, during its 12 Days of OpenAI live-stream event on December 20.\n\nAI-empowered search spreads across the internet\n\nGenerative AI is seemingly everywhere these days, so why wouldn\u2019t it be integrated into one of the internet\u2019s most basic features? Google has been toying with the technology for the past two years, first releasing the Search Generative Experience in May of 2023 before rolling out its AI Overview feature this past May. AI Overview generates a summary of the information that a user requests at the top of its search results page.\n\nPerplexity AI takes that technique a step further. Its \u201canswer engine\u201d scours the internet for the information a users requests, then synthesizes that data into a coherent, conversational (and cited) response, effectively eliminating the need to click through a list of links. OpenAI, ever the innovator, developed a nearly identical system for its chatbot, dubbed ChatGPT Search, which it debuted in October.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s Artifact kicks off a collaborative revolution\n\nTrying to generate, analyze, and edit large files \u2014 whether they\u2019re long-form creative essays or computer code snippets \u2014 directly within the chat stream can be overwhelming, requiring you to endlessly scroll back and forth to view the entirety of the document.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s Artifacts feature, which debuted in June, helps mitigate that issue by providing users with a separate preview window in which to view the AI-crafted text outside of the main conversation. The feature proved to be such a hit that OpenAI quickly followed suit with its own version.\n\nIts latest models and features have developed Anthropic into a formidable opponent to OpenAI and Google this year, which alone feels significant.\n\nImage and video generators finally figure out fingers\n\nUse Camera Control to direct every shot with intention. Learn how with today's Runway Academy. pic.twitter.com/vCGMkkhKds \u2014 Runway (@runwayml) November 2, 2024\n\nUsed to be that spotting an AI generated image or video was as simple as counting the number of appendages the subject shows \u2014 anything more than two arms, two legs, and 10 fingers were obviously generated, as Stable Diffusion 3\u2019s Cronenberg-esque images demonstrated in June. Yet, as 2024 comes to a close, differentiating between human and machine-made content has become significantly more difficult as image and video generators have rapidly improved both the quality and physiological accuracy of their outputs.\n\nAI video systems like Kling, Gen 3 Alpha, and Movie Gen are now capable of generating photorealistic clips with minimal distortion and fine-grain camera control, while the likes of Midjourney, Dall-E 3, and Imagen 3 can craft still images with a startling degree of realism (and minimal hallucinated artifacts) in myriad artistic styles.\n\nOh yeah, and OpenAI\u2019s Sora finally made its debut as part of its December announcements. The battle for AI-generated video models is heating up, and they got shockingly impressive in 2024.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s $10 billion effort to build the world\u2019s biggest AI training cluster\n\nxAI launched Grok 2.0 this year, the latest model built right into X. But the bigger news around Elon Musk\u2019s AI venture is around where this headed in the future. In 2024, Elon Musk set about constructing the \u201cworld\u2019s largest supercomputer\u201d just outside of Memphis, Tennessee, which came online at 4:20 a.m. on July 22. Driven by 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, the supercluster is tasked with training new versions of xAI\u2019s Grok generative AI model, which Musk claims will become \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful AI.\u201d\n\nMusk is expected to spend around $10 billion in capital and inference costs in 2024 alone but is reportedly working to double the number of GPUs powering the supercomputer in the new year."

            "article_content": "As science continues its evolution, discoveries and technologies can act like a master key that opens doors that lead to novel advancements. Artificial intelligence is one such key, making innovations possible by solving complex problems, automating tasks and enabling research that would have been impossible, or very time-consuming, without it.\n\nBut do we want to do research on all topics, and shall we try the AI master key on every door? To explore this question, let\u2019s consider the use of AI by genomics experts as an example.\n\nIn recent years, genomics experts have added unbelievable depth to what we know about the world and ourselves. For example, genetics researchers have revealed facts about when certain animals and plants were domesticated. In another example, DNA found in 30,000-year-old permafrost was used to create fertile samples of a plant called narrow-leafed campion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportantly, genetic engineering techniques such as CRISPR facilitate extraordinary advances in the treatment of complicated conditions, such as sickle-cell anemia.\n\nThanks to AI developments, we are witnessing a dramatic increase in the pace and scalability of genomic techniques, which will allow researchers to embark on exploratory journeys \u2014 and at the same time, add urgency to already-existing ethical issues. AI companies are also most interested in the scientific implications of this technology. We see this demonstrated in a recent interview between Harvard Business School officials and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In response to the question, \u201cWhat are the pieces of AI that you are most excited about?\u201d Altman said: \u201cGreatly increasing the rate of scientific discovery is what I\u2019m most excited about.\u201d\n\nHowever, given the risks and possible consequences of AI use in science, should we rush headlong into using AI in all kinds of projects?\n\nOne relevant example is research on Neanderthals, our closest relatives, who lived until about 40,000 years ago. Neanderthals have been studied for several years now through genetic investigation of their fossils and their DNA. Genetic engineering can potentially use ancient DNA and genome editing methods to re-create a Neanderthal or aspects of a Neanderthal\u2019s genetics and physiology.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo do this, scientists could start by figuring out the DNA sequence of a Neanderthal by comparing it with the DNA of modern humans, since they are closely related. Then, scientists could use CRISPR to swap out parts of human DNA with Neanderthal DNA. This process would require a lot of trial and error and might not succeed soon, but based on what we know about genetics, if something is possible, AI can help make it happen faster, cheaper and with less effort.\n\nScientists are excited about these developments because they could facilitate new discoveries and open up many new research opportunities in genetic research.\n\nWith or without AI, research on Neanderthals will proceed, but the extraordinary power of AI could give the final push to these discoveries and facilitate this kind of resurrection. At that point, the scientific community must develop norms and guidelines about how to treat these resurrected beings with dispositions very similar to humans. We would need to carefully consider their rights and well-being almost in the same way as when humans are involved and not as research subjects or artifacts of scientific curiosity. These ethical issues are discussed in more detail in a new paper published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence.\n\nA more holistic question to consider is: Should we prioritize the use of resource-intensive AI, researchers\u2019 time and public funds to resurrect extinct beings? Or should we invest these resources into conserving species that are critically endangered today to prevent biodiversity from more degradation?\n\n_____\n\nMohammad Hosseini, Ph.D., is an assistant professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\n_____"

After reviewing the table above to see which offer applies to your state, it\u2019s time to create an account. Registration is a breeze if you follow this step-by-step guide:\n\nTap a DraftKings promo code banner or link and press \u201cSign Up.\u201d Enter the required information; no promo code is necessary to get the bonus. Select a payment method and deposit at least $5. In some states, you can bet $5+ and instantly receive a $150 bonus. In other states, you must win a $5+ bet to score the $150 bonus.\n\nThe non-withdrawable bonuses expire seven days after issuance. Click a DraftKings promo code link for additional terms and conditions.\n\nDraftKings existing user promos\n\nDraftKings is one of the best sportsbooks for NFL betting thanks to a long list of ongoing promos. Two of my favorite options include:\n\nNFL TD Scorer Parlay Boost: Increase the odds on any NFL TD scorer parlay, same-game parlay or SGPx.\n\nLive SGP Profit Boost: Score boosted odds when you place a live same-game parlay on an NFL matchup.\n\nHow to use your DraftKings promo code on NFL Christmas Day games\n\nIf your wager must win to score the $150 bonus, it\u2019s best to play it safe and back a market with extremely short odds. The cash payout will be minimal, but you\u2019ll be well-positioned to earn the bonus.\n\nOne option is wagering on the Ravens' alternate spread +7.5 at -740 odds. The standard spread is Baltimore -4, so this adds plenty of cushion if the game takes a few unexpected turns. The implied probability is 88.1%, and you can take Baltimore at an even higher number to make the bet safer.\n\nUsers who just need to place a $5 bet to get the bonus have much more flexibility. The bonus is heading your way whether the bet wins or loses, allowing you to bet on a long shot and potentially score a hefty cash payout.\n\nI recommend betting on Steelers WR George Pickens to score the first touchdown at +950 odds. Pickens has missed three straight games due to an injury, and head coach Mike Tomlin told reporters that Pickens has a chance to return on Christmas\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s offense has struggled without the star WR. QB Russell Wilson\u2019s passing numbers have gone down, and Pickens should get plenty of targets if he can suit up.\n\n*Note: Odds are based on the best value our experts find as of publication; check lines closer to game time to ensure you get the best odds."

            "article_content": "New Delhi, Dec 26 (PTI) As technological advancements like AI, machine learning and precision medicine revolutionise drug discovery, manufacturing and patient care, Indian pharmaceutical industry is set for a 'profound transformation' in 2025 with innovation, wider global access and improvement in quality becoming key themes for the future.\n\nThe industry, which is expected to grow nearly two-fold to around USD 130 billion in size by 2030, is looking to take advantage of conducive policies, demographic and digital talent, in making India play a pivotal role in advancing global health for all.\n\nCurrently accounting for around 20 per cent of the overall generic drug sales globally, the Indian pharma industry is focussing on research excellence and innovation in order to position the country as a global hub for high-quality, affordable pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"The Indian pharma market is expected to move up to USD 120-130 billion by 2030 from the current size of USD 58 billion. Initiatives in terms of quality, innovation and wider global reach will help the Indian pharma sector to realise the potential,\" according to Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) Secretary General Sudarshan Jain.\n\nGiven the conducive policies and the advantage of demographic and digital talent, India will play a pivotal role in advancing global health for all in years to come, he added.\n\nIPA represents 23 leading research-based Indian pharmaceutical companies like Sun Pharma, Cipla, and Dr Reddy's Laboratories, among others.\n\nJain said innovation will continue to be a major focus for the industry going forward.\n\nHe noted that the government is expected to soon announce the operational details of the Promotion of Research & Innovation Programme which would also spur innovation.\n\nElaborating on the initiatives lined up in the private sector, he said that leading companies are increasing their focus on specialty portfolios and diversifying into higher-value drugs.\n\n\"Additionally, the industry is set to make notable progress in areas such as CAR-T cell therapy, mRNA vaccines, and the development of complex molecules, which hold immense potential for driving future growth,\" Jain said.\n\nBesides, the patent expiries of blockbuster biologics by 2025 present a significant growth avenue in the global biosimilars market, he stated.\n\nSimilarly, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) Director General Anil Matai said the industry is set for a profound transformation in 2025.\n\nTechnological advancements like AI, machine learning and precision medicine are set to revolutionise drug discovery, manufacturing and patient care, he said.\n\nOPPI represents research-based pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Novartis and Merck, in India.\n\nBesides, strengthened regulatory frameworks will enable the swift adoption of innovative therapies while prioritising patient safety, Matai said.\n\n\"A focus on research excellence and innovation will position India as a global hub for high-quality, affordable pharmaceuticals. Collaboration between policymakers, academia and industry stakeholders will address unmet medical needs, particularly in underserved regions,\" he stated.\n\nAlso, adherence to Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) will uphold ethical standards, fostering trust and transparency across the healthcare ecosystem, Matai stated.\n\nReflecting on the year gone by, Jain said 2024 has been a year of building on a robust foundation with sustainable growth and thrust on simplifying regulations and harmonisation with global standards.\n\nThe PLI (production linked incentive) schemes have started seeing dividends with the launch of greenfield projects for the production of Penicillin G and Clavulanic acid, among others.\n\nMatai noted that the notification of the Patent (Amendment) Rules 2024, waivers for Phase 3 clinical trials for certain categories of drugs already approved in well-regulated markets, and the much-awaited Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) with European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states reflect India's progressive strides toward creating a dynamic, globally competitive pharmaceutical sector that is driven by innovation.\n\nCommenting on the healthcare segment, Fortis Healthcare MD & CEO Ashutosh Raghuvanshi said that the hospital market is projected to grow from nearly USD 99 billion in 2023 to an estimated USD 194 billion by 2032.\n\n\"Our sector is not only expanding but evolving to meet the diverse needs of our population. This year has been particularly significant as hospitals have emerged as the leading recipients of foreign direct investment within the healthcare landscape,\" he added.\n\nLooking ahead, the industry must focus on several key trends that will shape the future of healthcare in India, Raghuvanshi said.\n\n\"The ageing population will drive demand for specialised geriatric care, while a growing emphasis on preventive care will shift our focus from merely treating illness to promoting wellness,\" he stated.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and telemedicine will enhance diagnostic precision and operational efficiency, ultimately improving patient outcomes, he added.\n\nCommenting on the medtech sector, Poly Medicure MD Himanshu Baid said it is imperative for companies to step up their investments in R&D and innovation to sustain growth momentum.\n\n\"The future belongs to those who can develop transformative technologies that address the healthcare needs of a dynamic and diverse world. With initiatives like the new medical devices scheme and a favourable regulatory environment providing the necessary foundation, India is well-positioned to expand its influence globally,\" he added.\n\nAs the market is expected to reach USD 50 billion by FY30, the med-tech industry's growth story reflects the power of collaboration and self-reliance, he added.\n\nMetropolis Healthcare Promoter and Executive Chairperson Ameera Shah said as the diagnostics industry progresses from USD 13 billion in FY23 towards an expected USD 25 billion by FY28, it is fuelled by increasing awareness of preventive healthcare, an aging population, and broader insurance coverage.\n\nHowever, the path forward demands a strategic focus on technology, accessibility, and collaboration, she added.\n\nThe future of diagnostics lies in embracing genomics, digitalisation and technologies such as AI, machine learning, and data analytics, Shah said."

However, Wall Street decided to kick off the party a bit early.\n\nSince Election Day, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500 and growth stock-dependent Nasdaq have all ascended to record-closing highs. This is a continuation of the robust gains Wall Street's major indexes enjoyed during Trump's first term. Between Jan. 20, 2017 and Jan. 20, 2021, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite soared 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\n\nBut to quote Wall Street's favorite warning: \"Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\"\n\nAlthough stocks thrived with Trump in the Oval Office, there's genuine concern that his desire to implement tariffs on Day One could undermine American businesses and cause the stock market to plunge. Based on what history tell us, this isn't out of the realm of possibilities.\n\nTrump's prior tariffs had a harmful effect on stocks\n\nLast month, President-elect Trump laid out his plan to impose a 25% tariff on imports from its direct neighbors, Canada and Mexico, as well as 35% tariff on imported goods from China, the world's No. 2 economy.\n\nThe general purpose of tariffs is to make American-made goods more price-competitive with those being brought in from beyond our borders. They're also designed to encourage multinational businesses to manufacture their goods destined for the U.S. within the confines of our borders.\n\nBut according to an analysis from Liberty Street Economics, which publishes research for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Trump's tariffs have previously had a decisively negative impact on U.S. equities exposed to countries where those tariffs were targeted.\n\nThe four authors of Do Import Tariffs Protect U.S. Firms? make it a point to distinguish between the impacts of tariffs on outputs versus inputs. An output tariff is an added cost placed on the final price of a good, such as a car imported into the country. Meanwhile, an input tariff would affect the cost of producing a final good (e.g., higher costs on imported steel). The authors note that higher input tariffs make it difficult for U.S. manufacturers to compete on price with foreign businesses.\n\nThe authors also examined the stock market returns of all publicly traded U.S. companies on the day Trump announced tariffs in 2018 and 2019. They found a clear negative shift in equity prices on the days tariffs were announced, with this effect being most pronounced on businesses that were exposed to China.\n\nFurthermore, the authors noted a correlation between companies that performed poorly on tariff announcement days and \"future real outcomes.\" Specifically, these businesses experienced declines in profits, employment, sales, and labor productivity from 2019 through 2021, based on the authors' calculations.\n\nIn other words, history would suggest that tariffs being implemented on Day One of Donald Trump's second term can be a downside catalyst for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite.\n\nStocks are pricey, raising concerns about a correction\n\nUnfortunately, history has a bit of a double whammy for investors. While comparing the historic performance of equities on tariff announcement days during Trump's first term provides a limited data set, one of Wall Street's top valuation indicators, which can be back-tested 153 years, offers ample reason for concern.\n\nIn other words, there's another reason for investors to be nervous about the market besides tariffs: Stock valuations are relatively high.\n\nA lot of investors are probably familiar with the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which divides a publicly traded company's share price into its trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS). The traditional P/E ratio is a fairly effective valuation tool that helps investors determine if a stock is cheap or expensive relative to its peers and the broad-market indexes.\n\nThe downside to the P/E ratio is that can be easily disrupted by shock events. For instance, lockdowns that occurred during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic rendered the trailing-12-month EPS relatively useless for most companies for about a year.\n\nThis is where the S&P 500's Shiller P/E Ratio, which is also known as the cyclically adjusted P/E Ratio (CAPE Ratio), can come in handy.\n\nS&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nThe Shiller P/E Ratio is based on average inflation-adjusted EPS from the previous 10 years. Looking at a decade's worth of inflation-adjusted earnings data makes shock events something of a moot point when assessing the valuation of equities, as a whole.\n\nAs of the closing bell on Dec. 20, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E sat at 37.68, which is more than double its 153-year average of 17.19. But what's more worrisome is how the stock market has responded following previous instances where the Shiller P/E has topped 30.\n\nWhat happens when stock prices are high?\n\nDating back to January 1871, there have only been six instances where the S&P 500's Shiller P/E crested 30 during a bull market rally, including the present. Each prior occurrence was eventually followed by a 20% to 89% decline in the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and/or Nasdaq Composite.\n\nTo be clear, the Shiller P/E doesn't give us any clues as to when stock market downturns will begin. Sometimes stocks have extended valuations for a matter of weeks before tumbling, such as the two-month stretch preceding the start of the Great Depression in 1929. Meanwhile, the Shiller P/E topped 30 for four years prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. Nevertheless, this historic valuation metric suggests stocks can plunge -- and it would have made no difference which presidential candidate won in November.\n\nStock investing for the long haul usually works out\n\nHowever, history can be a beacon of hope and inspiration, too, depending on your investment horizon.\n\nNo matter how much investors would prefer to do away with stock market corrections, bear markets, and crashes, they're ultimately a normal and inevitable aspect of the investing cycle. But what's important to note is that the ups and downs associated with investing aren't linear.\n\nFor example, the analysts at Bespoke Investment Group calculated the average calendar-day length of S&P 500 bull and bear markets since the beginning of the Great Depression and discovered night-and-day differences between the two.\n\nOn one hand, the 27 S&P 500 bear markets between Sept. 1929 and June 2023 averaged just 286 calendar days (around 9.5 months), with the longest bear market clocking in at 630 calendar days. On the other side of the coin, the typical S&P 500 bull market endured 1,011 calendar days over the 94 years examined. Further, 14 out of 27 bull markets (if you include and extrapolate the current bull market to present day) have stuck around longer than the lengthiest bear market.\n\n^SPX data by YCharts. YCharts S&P 500 return data begins in 1950.\n\nAn analysis from Crestmont Research looked back even further on the performance of equities over long periods and came to an even more encouraging conclusion.\n\nCrestmont calculated the rolling 20-year total returns (including dividends) of the S&P 500 since the start of the 20th century. Even though the S&P didn't officially exist until 1923, researchers were able to track the performance of its components in other indexes to satisfy its back-test to 1900. This 20-year hold timeline produced 105 ending periods (1919 through 2023).\n\nWhat Crestmont's annually updated data set shows is that all 105 rolling 20-year periods would have generated a positive total return. Hypothetically speaking, if you had purchased an S&P 500 index fund just prior to the start of the Great Depression in 1929, or before Black Monday in 1987, and held that stake for 20 years, you'd have still made money.\n\nCrestmont Research's data set also conclusively shows that the stock market can make patient investors richer regardless of which political party is in power. No matter how you arrange the political puzzle pieces, 20-year total returns have always been decisively positive.\n\nSean Williams has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

At the same time, high interest rates may deter investors.\n\nYet, he said what is important here is \"how stable we will remain and how sustainable growth we can achieve.\"\n\n\"In that sense, we see that a very successful policy is being implemented. In economic and political terms, there are positive developments such as the decline in inflation and the decrease in the current account deficit,\" he noted.\n\nReminding that the work of Chinese brands to establish production facilities would be concluded soon, Bilalo\u011flu said: \"I think Togg will also increase its production capacity. In this case, I predict that the electric vehicle market share will increase to 30%, provided that the current \u00d6TV conditions do not change.\"\n\n\"As Do\u011fu\u015f Otomotiv, we also established a company in 2024, D-Charge. We currently have approximately 335 sockets in 27 provinces. Next year, this will increase to 48 provinces, and we will have 670 sockets,\" he concluded."

Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThree years later, hundreds of those homes have been rebuilt, most ballooning in size and value.\n\nOn Bequette\u2019s former property in Louisville now sits a house twice the size of her comparatively modest tri-level: a six-bedroom, five-bathroom, 4,123-square-foot home that sold for $1.45 million earlier this year, Boulder County property records show. That\u2019s 53% higher than the median home sales price of $947,500 for the past 365 days in Louisville, according to Jon Hatch, a Realtor with Compass Boulder, citing data from IRES MLS and REcolorado.\n\nIn 2023, Louisville\u2019s median home sales price was $778,000, he noted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very common pattern that we see, that homes are now bigger or fancier,\u201d said Deserai Anderson Crow, a University of Colorado Denver professor who has researched crises and disasters such as the Marshall Fire, Covid-19 pandemic, and the 2013 floods in Boulder County. \u201cNot only does that change the nature of a community, it also changes the nature of the housing stock and affordability. And having a lot of fancy houses in a community tends to raise the value (and property taxes and insurance) of surrounding houses, even if they aren\u2019t fancy.\u201d\n\n\u2018It turned into a free-for-all\u2019\n\nSoaring housing costs are old hat in Colorado, especially in and around the city of Boulder.\n\nFrom the 1970s until just recently, the idyllic college town and business hub that\u2019s highly decorated with scores of \u201cbest of\u201d honors, had in place anti-growth restrictions that sent home affordability rocketing out of reach. Residents and commuters spilled out into neighboring communities, (such as the fire-affected Louisville and Superior) which also continued to grow increasingly desirable on their own and saw rising home prices as a result.\n\nBequette, a former public school teacher and a retired pottery studio manager and instructor, is among a long list of longtime residents who did not \u2014 or could not afford to \u2014 return home and rebuild. A Colorado Division of Insurance study found that only 8% of affected homeowners had full guaranteed replacement coverage.\n\n\u201cI never did belong there,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a teacher, I never could have afforded to live in that neighborhood. It just so happened that through being married and divorced and all that, I ended up with the mortgage.\u201d\n\nOn January 5, 2022, Allison Bequette went to her house's site in Louisville, Colorado, for the first time after the fire with her daughter (pictured), who grew up in that house. Courtesy Allison Bequette\n\nIn her case, she was among at least 19 others who sold their properties for under $375,000 (sums often less than their original purchase values), according to a CNN review of property records. The buyer, California-based Homebound Technologies, then constructed substantially larger new builds that are selling for upward of $1.4 million.\n\nHomebound officials did not return multiple emails and calls from CNN.\n\nBequette was not uninsured but said the full amount of her payout wasn\u2019t enough to rebuild the same home in the same place. The amount she was insured for would\u2019ve allowed her to build a home that was less than half the size of the 2,100-square-foot house she had before.\n\n\u201cIt turned into a free-for-all,\u201d she said of the homes built in her neighborhood after the fire. \u201cThey\u2019re three and four stories tall; can you imagine my little 1,000-square-foot (rebuilt) house in the middle of that? I just didn\u2019t belong there.\u201d\n\nBequette since relocated to southern Colorado, where she now has a house (and a little pottery studio) on a small plot of land.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to move, just got to keep going,\u201d she said.\n\nDeepening disparities, increasing NIMBYism\n\nHousing has become increasingly unaffordable across the US, with the pandemic and subsequent burst in inflation making matters even worse. But the crux of the problem is a supply-and-demand one that\u2019s intensified since the financial crisis of 2008: There just aren\u2019t enough homes available for purchase.\n\nAnd when disaster strikes, that deficit can deepen and ongoing disparities can widen, said Crow, the University of Colorado Denver professor.\n\nDisaster recovery played heavily into the formation of Homebound, founded after the 2017 Tubbs Fire in California with the premise of using technology to work with affected homeowners to speed up the permitting and building process and cut through the thick, red tape following a disaster to quickly bring more homes back on the market.\n\nA home is being constructed in the hills where all the homes were destroyed during the 2017 Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, California, on December 7, 2022. Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nHomebound since has expanded into buying and selling properties in states such as California, Colorado, Florida and Texas.\n\n\u201cIf you rebuild your house but nobody around you rebuilds your neighborhood is worse off,\u201d Homebound founder and CEO Nicole Pechet told CBS Colorado in 2022. \u201cIf we could help accelerate the rebuild of the entire community, not only would it mean the community gets back faster, but also the more volume we\u2019re building at a given time the better pricing we can get for our homeowners we\u2019re building with. So, it really benefits everyone.\u201d\n\nWhile the new builds can be a reflection of higher costs that exist today as well as market demand, they also underscore how unexpected catastrophes can change the character of areas in short order, Crow said.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of a disaster \u2014 and we saw this with the (2013) floods \u2014 when a community is faced with a conversation around how to replace the housing stock that was lost, very often you start to see conversations that resemble the NIMBY, or \u2018not in my backyard,\u2019 when it comes to affordable housing in communities,\u201d Crow said.\n\nPlus, when an area suddenly loses its housing stock, it puts additional economic pressure on the local and surrounding communities to absorb displaced residents, resulting in the increase of rents and other housing costs, she said.\n\nRecent studies of hurricane-affected communities in Florida and Louisiana have shown that the storms ultimately accelerated gentrification.\n\nLayering tragedy atop tragedy\n\nOne of the immediate negative effects of the Marshall Fire was substantial price gouging, which further compounded issues for affected renters such as Christina Eisert.\n\nEisert, a single mom, had recently returned to Colorado after a brief stint in Texas. She and two of her three boys (one was already off to college) found a single-family home for rent in Superior\u2019s Sagamore neighborhood. The property\u2019s locale, near parks and trails, was ideal when the pandemic hit and provided scenic, safe and secure opportunities for Eisert\u2019s youngest son, who has Down Syndrome, to be outdoors.\n\nIt also served as home base for Eisert, an adjunct professor at the University of Colorado, who had hoped to take on more hours and other contract work to build up enough savings to be able to become a homeowner again.\n\nChristina Eisert poses on December 4, 2024. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nOn December 30, 2021, Eisert and her teenage sons had just left home for a haircut appointment but doubled back when she saw flames nearby. She drove past the emergency barriers that were being put in place and successfully saved their two dogs from a house that soon would be a complete loss.\n\nAs Eisert and her sons navigated the immediate trauma and loss of possessions and memories from their lifetimes, the search for stable housing became extremely challenging. Asking rents had soared north of $5,000 \u2014 well more than double the median in the area.\n\n\u201cThe rents just really exploded immediately; it was such a tragedy on top of all of the other tragedies,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter bouncing around to a couple of apartments, Eisert a few weeks ago bought a small home further north in the county. But it took some doing and a lot of holes to dig out of, she said.\n\n\u201cThe disaster funding wasn\u2019t really accessible to renters, and I probably lost maybe $100,000 worth of property. On top of all of that, you feel like you have less buying power in multiple ways: There\u2019s less property (for sale), the insurance is way higher, there\u2019s new housing, but it\u2019s much more expensive than the houses that would have been if they were for sale before the fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll these things kind of converge.\u201d\n\nRenters especially disadvantaged\n\nIn addition to price-gouging \u2014 which prompted a post-fire law change in Colorado \u2014 disasters leave longer-lasting effects for renters, said Kelsea Best, an assistant professor at The Ohio State University.\n\nBest\u2019s research has focused on how natural hazards and climate change interact with existing inequities and how renters are especially disadvantaged. She was the lead author on a 2023 study in Risk Analysis that found rental prices were driven higher in the years following a hurricane in eastern coastal areas of the US.\n\n\u201cMore intense hurricanes, higher wind speeds, corresponded to significantly higher increases in rents in the years following a storm,\u201d Best told CNN of the research, which studied county-level hurricane disaster data in 19 coastal states from 2008-2019.\n\nPart of the increases stem from an immediate loss of supply; however, it also reflects the delays and challenges of rebuilding and constructing multifamily units post-disaster, she said. Additionally, the financial positions of renters \u2014 who already are typically some of the most economically vulnerable \u2014 are negatively impacted because housing disaster assistance generally favors homeowners, she added.\n\nAerial view of destroyed houses in Port St Lucie, Florida, after a tornado hit the area and caused severe damage as Hurricane Milton swept through Florida on October 11, 2024. Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cSome of our findings suggest that there should be more targeted assistance \u2014 federally and locally \u2014 after a storm for renters and for targeted repair and reconstruction of rental homes, which tend to be repaired after private homes are repaired,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd noting how separate research under review shows how hurricanes can contribute to rising evictions, Best suggested that post-storm eviction moratoria could prove beneficial in helping affected residents.\n\nIn terms of addressing affordability more broadly after a disaster, some communities have explored ideas such as community land trusts, relaxing rental rules, ensuring disaster funding is reaching those most in need, and making disaster recovery preparations, Shannon Van Zandt, a Texas A&M professor who has researched how disasters affect housing affordability, wrote in a 2022 commentary.\n\nFollowing the 2013 flood in Boulder County \u2014 a weeklong downpour that resulted in a 100-year event \u2014 the state created the Colorado Resiliency Office, which works closely with communities to understand their risks (economic, climate or otherwise) and prepare for potential disasters.\n\nSince the Marshall Fire, Colorado also enacted several disaster-related laws to address issues such as insurance gaps (as 92% of affected residents were underinsured); rebuilding costs; and safe living conditions.\n\nThe need for a \u2018stitch in time\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, one sudden moment can waylay a person\u2019s life and ability to own a home for years.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a decade since a torrent of muddy water literally ripped Sarah Jane Romano\u2019s mountain house in two while she made pork chops, eggs and sweet potatoes in the kitchen while swaddling her 9-month-old daughter.\n\nWhile she, her daughter and her then-husband escaped with their lives from the devastating September 2013 flood event in Boulder County, the years that have followed have been mucky, grimy messes of their own. Financially, Romano was caught in a murky holding period with her insurance company and state and county regulators.\n\n\u201cIt was a hair-raising nightmare, you hold your breath and hope that the engineer called it a mud flow instead of a landslide, because if it\u2019s considered a landslide, then you don\u2019t get any money,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd even though the land was condemned, in order to get the insurance payout, they had to dig out the ruins of the home to determine whether the foundation was solid enough for rebuilding, she said. The rigmarole (and the mortgage payments on the destroyed property) continued for two years.\n\nSarah Jane Romano poses on November 19, 2024, with a drawing of her former home, which was destroyed in the 2013 flood event in Boulder County, Colorado. Austin Steele/CNN\n\n\u201cI believe government policy should enact a standard of the local and national governments being able to supersede any punitive and pointless insurance policy which requires homeowners to engage in expensive and lengthy processes to have their sites evaluated once land has been condemned,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have to foreclose on homes that have been destroyed or continue to pay the mortgage as we did on a condemned property in order to get their home\u2019s value returned to them.\u201d\n\nThen there were the multitude of losses beyond the money: the community members who had helped out with child care or pet care; the friendships and emotional support; and her marriage.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she said of her divorce. \u201cAnd many, many, many families in that situation didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nEleven years later, Romano, while acknowledging that she hasn\u2019t \u201cput a penny in retirement since the flood,\u201d is finally on more stable ground. After working six days a week, and scraping together whatever savings she had left as well as borrowing some funds from her parents, she bought a little A-frame in Boulder Canyon for her and her daughter.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be protection at the national level and a stipend program to ameliorate some of these catastrophic stresses,\u201d she said, adding that in turn could help ease burdens on health care costs, businesses and social programs.\n\n\u201cThere is no one who needs the stitch in time more than those whose life\u2019s fabric has been torn by disaster.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The slopes haven\u2019t opened yet at Mt. Holiday, a small ski hill in Traverse City. They\u2019re still building up the base of snow.\n\nJim Pearson, the executive director, has been coming to the slope since he was a teenager in the mid-1980s. And he hopes they\u2019ll have a decent season thanks to some cold nights that have made up for slightly warmer days, a big difference from last season \u2014 northern Michigan\u2019s hottest winter on record.\n\n\u201cAll of it would melt, because it was getting into the 60s, it was 40s at night,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can compete with that kind of weather.\u201d\n\nWith businesses like Mt. Holiday battered by months of warm weather, the federal government declared a drought in more than 40 Michigan counties, including in Grand Traverse County, where the ski hill is located.\n\nThat allowed Pearson to apply for a federal Economic Injury Disaster Loan through the Small Business Administration, and Mt. Holiday received $480,000 interest-free for a year. It helped meet the payroll and catch up on bills.\n\n\u201cEven if we\u2019re not making snow that lasts, we still have to make snow,\u201d he said. That made for expensive electricity bills. \u201cYou have 10 (snow) guns running all night long for two or three days. That\u2019s a lot of power and a lot of expense.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture determines which areas fall under droughts and are available for assistance. But relying on the drought declarations for loans meant some counties that were harmed by the warmer winter, but didn\u2019t have that designation, didn\u2019t qualify for help.\n\nNow, a group of senators from Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota want to expand the program to include a new category of economic disaster: a lack of snow.\n\nHow it would work\n\nThe bill, introduced this September in the U.S. Senate, is called the Winter Recreation Small Business Recovery Act. It would make a small tweak to the language of the existing program.\n\nElected officials have pushed for such steps before; last spring, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on the federal government to provide more options, saying businesses struggling with warm winters didn\u2019t have a good way to access federal relief.\n\nThe idea is to ensure that businesses harmed by winters like the last one are able to get help. Michigan Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, was not made available for an interview with IPR. In a news release, he said Michigan had \u201clost millions of dollars in revenue,\u201d and that ski hills had lost about $41 million and laid off thousands of employees.\n\n\u201cNo one had really contemplated the fact that a lack of snow and ice was a different kind of drought,\u201d said Brad Garmon, the executive director of the state\u2019s Outdoor Recreation Industry Office within the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.\n\nThe existing drought declaration doesn\u2019t work for many businesses that rely on snow. And while organizations and governments need long-term strategies to deal with a changing climate, Garmon said expanding the loan program would help make distribution of these funds more equitable.\n\nThe program \u201cwas so unevenly accessible and we had businesses that could need it but couldn\u2019t get it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is a fix to one particular tool. It\u2019s not the fix, necessarily, for everything that we\u2019re facing.\u201d\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nClimate trends are pointing to warmer winters for places such as northern Michigan.\n\nSteven Dundas, an environmental economist and associate professor at Oregon State University who studies the intersection of economy and climate, agreed this kind of loan program helps in the short term but said that with \u201cmost climate models predicting reduced snowpack moving forward, this, to me, seems like a short-run fix for a long-run problem.\u201d\n\nEstimating how climate change could reshape the recreation economy is difficult, Dundas said; the range of factors and potential outcomes makes it hard to draw neat conclusions. For instance, warmer springs and falls could allow for certain outdoor activities to rise in some areas.\n\nStill, the effects of unpredictable winters and low snow can be devastating. Dundas pointed to a 2022 study published in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management that gathered national data from short-term rentals like AirBnBs near ski resorts and correlated it to snowpack.\n\n\u201cThey suggest ski areas could see visitation drops around 60 percent with billions of dollars in annual damages,\u201d he said, with the authors predicting declines of 40 to 60% by the end of the century. Much of that is concentrated in Utah and California, but while the results varied widely by state, the study found places like Michigan could lose tens of millions of dollars in revenue from recreation each year.\n\nDundas said expanding the SBA loan program would help prepare for unusual weather rather than long-term shifts in the climate.\n\n\u201cThe proposed bill is perfect for a weather shock,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we anticipate that that weather shock is going to become more common as climate changes, that requires kind of a little bit more out of the box thinking about policies that can help incentivize adaptation and resilience in these communities, rather than a boom-and-bust climate cycle with snowpack.\u201d\n\nSome left behind, this time\n\nFor many who depend on winter weather for their livelihood, even a small fix can make a big difference.\n\nThe Senate bill is trying to reach people like Dax Richer, one of the new owners of Ruth Lake Resort, in the Upper Peninsula\u2019s Baraga County. That county was not under a drought declaration, even though they didn\u2019t get enough snow to bring in many visitors, so his resort was not eligible for those federal loans.\n\n\u201cWe had absolutely no one stay at the resort during the winter months during our first year of owning it,\u201d he said. Richer and his husband were expecting to make about $125,000 this year. They made less than half that, around $47,000.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re completely confused why our county, in the middle of all these other counties that received support, was singled out to not receive it.\u201d\n\nAnd while summers are still busy, if tourism doesn\u2019t work out, he said, they might turn the resort into long-term housing.\n\nBack at Mt. Holiday, the fragrance of burning wood drifts from a sauna trailer whose owner rents space in the parking lot, just one of the changes they\u2019ve made in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe want people to be out here, hiking, biking. I want to do concerts, running events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in partnership with East Bay Township to expand those trails. Hopefully that\u2019ll start this summer.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re looking at a new norm, Pearson said, so they\u2019re hedging their bets.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInterlochen Public Radio\u2019s Claire Keenan-Kurgan contributed to this report.

The complexity of managing diverse cloud platforms with varying security configurations, identity management systems, and access controls creates gaps in policy enforcement and visibility. For organizations adopting zero-trust in multi-cloud setups, achieving consistent security across these platforms demands automation, continuous monitoring, and real-time threat detection.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat unique challenges do multi-cloud environments pose for companies adopting a zero-trust security model?\n\nIn multi-cloud environments, the complexity of managing identities, policies, and access controls across diverse platforms makes implementing a zero-trust security model a distinct challenge. Each cloud provider has unique security configurations, identity management systems, and data protection protocols, so enforcing policies consistently \u2014 not to mention achieving complete visibility is no mean feat. It can be tough to achieve continuous monitoring and validation of users, devices and network traffic across disparate clouds, or it can require significant overheads spent on integration.\n\nAdditionally, as data across multiple clouds can be fragmented, there is an increased risk of misconfigurations and inconsistent security practices, potentially leading to gaps in the zero-trust model. Inter-cloud communication is another hurdle, and managing secure connections and encrypted traffic between clouds demands additional controls and oversight.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHow are you helping clients integrate zero-trust principles with their existing cloud security frameworks?\n\nSuccessfully adopting zero-trust for multi-cloud requires unified visibility, automated policy enforcement, and a strong understanding of each provider\u2019s unique security ecosystem. At CyberProof, we start with in-depth assessment of each client\u2019s cloud architecture and existing policies, identifying gaps and vulnerabilities. We are partnered with Wiz for cloud detection and response, and integrate CTEM like Interpres Security to map threats to defence gaps. The identity of users and their posture is a key component of this. We then map out a zero-trust model that aligns with the infrastructure, so access controls, identity management and threat detection are applied consistently and without gaps across multi-cloud.\n\nReactive security keeps you two steps behind, so regular threat hunting and vulnerability assessments are also essential. Proactively seeking out threats helps to uncover any potential risks, and reinforces the strategies in place for incident response.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nMoving forward, we leverage automation, orchestration and continuous monitoring to enforce zero-trust policies, using real-time identity verification and behavioural analysis to detect potential threats. Threat intelligence and advanced analytics provide visibility over network traffic and access \u2014 even across a multi-cloud reality. We\u2019ve found this approach allows clients to adopt zero-trust principles without the need to overhaul existing security investments.\n\nWhat role do AI and machine learning play in enabling zero-trust architectures within multi-cloud frameworks?\n\nForrester and many other analysts are already touting the benefits of AI and machine learning in enhancing cloud security use cases such as real-time threat detection, user behaviour analysis, and automated response. In a zero-trust model, continuous monitoring and verification of all users and devices are critical, and AI-driven analytics enable this by detecting deviations from normal behaviour patterns that could indicate insider threats or account takeovers.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nMachine learning algorithms can analyse vast amounts of data from multiple cloud environments to identify patterns and detect anomalies faster and more accurately than traditional methods. This capability is especially valuable in multi-cloud settings, where data is distributed, and access requests occur across diverse platforms. Additionally, AI-powered automation can enforce zero-trust policies by instantly verifying identity and access permissions and triggering response actions in real time to minimize potential risks.\n\nCould you discuss any specific zero-trust solutions or services your company offers that address the challenges of multi-cloud data protection?\n\nOur end-to-end Zero Trust Security solution is designed to meet a critical need in any organization\u2019s cybersecurity perimeter. We use the \u2018never trust, always verify\u2019 principle to enforce rigorous security controls for all users, anywhere. Features include continuous authentication, least-privilege access controls, and micro-segmentation to protect crown jewel assets, including sensitive data, network access, and cloud environments.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAccording to Tony Velleca, CEO of CyberProof, a UST company, \u2018A well-planned zero-trust strategy is essential for mitigating the risks associated with multi-cloud environments and improving overall security posture.\u2019\n\nAcross a multi-cloud environment, the risks to data are manifold, including unauthorized access, data leakage, corruption, and cyberthreats. We offer a wide range of data protection services depending on the business context, including data risk assessment and consulting, data discovery and classification, data loss prevention and access control, data integrity and usage monitoring, a range of security audits, and data archiving and destruction.\n\nWhat strategies or tools do you recommend for organizations struggling with secure identity and access management across different cloud providers?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWe would always recommend adopting a unified identity and access management (IAM) strategy that includes centralized policy enforcement, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and advanced behavioural analytics.\n\nTools like Azure AD, Okta, or AWS IAM simplify secure access control across multi-cloud environments. Mapping threat actors as well as how organizations are mapping threat actor campaigns to gaps in their defence infrastructure is also fundamental. With this in place, Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services then integrate with IAM and CTEM tools to monitor and respond to access anomalies in real-time. By centralizing IAM policies and leveraging AI-driven insights, you can streamline secure access, even across diverse cloud providers.\n\nHow can companies measure the success of zero-trust implementation in a multi-cloud setup?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nCreating and assessing KPIs at a regular cadence is crucial to measuring the success of a zero-trust implementation and refining and iterating it over time. Three examples of metrics which can be used are:\n\n\u2022 Failed or blocked access attempts: Tracking the reduction in unauthorized access, including unauthorized login attempts across cloud environments can uncover how strong IAM control mechanisms are.\n\n\u2022 Mean-time-to-Detect (MTTD): How quickly are potential threats being identified and mitigated? The shorter the response time, the more effective the monitoring and automated response processes are likely to be.\n\n\u2022 Policy compliance rate: Across all cloud environments, how consistently are access policies being followed? If you note compliance violations or deviations from your baseline access policies, zero trust integration is not yet fully effective.\n\nWhat are the best practices for incident detection and response under a zero-trust framework?\n\nIn a zero-trust environment, effective incident detection and response relies on the ability to continuously monitor, receive real-time analytics, and enforce automated containment of threats. There can be no gaps \u2014 zero-trust requires all traffic, user behaviours, and device activities to be continuously monitored. Behavioural analytics are powerful here; identifying threats before they can add business risk.\n\nWhen a threat is identified, automated containment like blocking malicious IP addresses or isolating compromised accounts should be part of response workflows, which means negligible time between detection and mitigation. In a complex multi-cloud set-up, a unified security platform that ensures consistent policies are applied is crucial and allows for rapid detection even in a heterogeneous context.\n\nReactive security keeps you two steps behind, so regular threat-hunting and vulnerability assessments are also essential. Proactively seeking out threats helps to uncover any potential risks, and reinforces the strategies in place for incident response.\n\nIn your experience, what are the most common pitfalls organizations face with zero trust in multi-cloud deployments?\n\nAccording to Microsoft, 85% of organizations already have a multi-cloud approach, and zero trust is one of their recommended best practices for threat protection and hardening overall security posture. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy! Each cloud provider has its own unique configuration, which means uniform security policies can be a struggle. The challenge of managing identities across multi-cloud means there is an added risk of misconfigured permissions or unauthorized access. I\u2019ve seen organizations suffer from inconsistent policy enforcement across clouds, grapple with identity management challenges, and even after heavy architecture changes \u2014 contend with limited visibility across platforms.\n\nImplementing zero trust in a multi-cloud environment starts with visibility, centralizing your view of all activities across all cloud assets \u2014 without gaps. This can strengthen zero-trust efforts, alongside policy alignment, intelligent integrations, and continuous monitoring.\n\nTony Velleca\n\nCEO of CyberProof, A UST Company\n\naanchalg@cybermedia.co.in"

            "article_content": "Right from generative AI models to hybrid cloud deployments, HPCL is marrying innovation with pragmatism to tackle modern-day digital challenges of data security, scalability, and cost optimization.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nJayant Gupta, Executive Director of Information Systems at HPCL, has an exclusive conversation- talking about the company\u2019s strategies for leveraging generative AI, managing hybrid cloud environments, and ensuring seamless IT operations.\n\nHe reveals how AI is transforming processes in finance, recruitment, and customer interaction while underlining how HPCL has been proactive in security, preventing vendor lock-in, and providing its employees with up-skilling to gain an upper edge in the digital race.\n\nHow is HPCL leveraging generative AI, and how do you address the associated security challenges?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat we\u2019ve done with Gen AI is that, at this point in time, we are using it more as models that are enterprise-based and on-prem. We use a couple of models like LLaMA and others to handle the generative part, like creating summaries or building intelligence from there. We\u2019ve been able to apply this across multiple use cases in various streams.\n\nFinance: Generative AI is used to summarize audit reports, identify commonalities, and streamline processes, enabling auditors to detect recurring issues more efficiently.\n\nInteractive Bots: Generative AI enhances chatbot capabilities, improving user interactions.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nRecruitment: AI extracts data from scanned documents and forms, automating information entry and ensuring data consistency.\n\nSo far, using these on-prem solutions has worked well for us. Since we run everything within our environment, no data\u2014including metadata\u2014is pushed externally. However, we are grappling with challenges around certain LLMs that are cloud-based, such as Microsoft\u2019s CoPilot. While piloting these solutions, we\u2019ve noticed that metadata is sent out, even though the rest of the data remains internal. How safe this is remains an open question for us.\n\nHindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) has adopted a hybrid cloud model, using on-premises solutions for sensitive data and a public cloud for specialized APIs or functionalities.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhy did HPCL choose a hybrid cloud model, and how do you decide workloads for on-premise versus public cloud?\n\nThe decision to adopt a hybrid model is driven by cost considerations and specific functionality needs. With a Tier-4 green enterprise data centre, we prioritize using in-house resources but leverage the public cloud for specialized APIs or functionalities unavailable internally.\n\nThis setup allows us to use internal resources extensively, and we only look outside when necessary. Our solutions span across private, public, and hybrid cloud models, depending on the requirements.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhen deciding on these solutions, we consider two key factors:\n\n1. Cost: We prioritize more cost-effective solutions.\n\n2. Functionality: If a specific functionality, solution, or API is available on the cloud and is more effective, we adopt it.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWith a Tier-4 green enterprise data centre, we prioritize using in-house resources but leverage the public cloud for specialized APIs or functionalities unavailable internally.\n\nIn practice, workloads purely consumed and produced by the public are typically best suited for the public cloud. For workloads generated internally but accessed externally, we move them to the public cloud for better access. It ultimately depends on the type of solution required. However, for public-facing solutions, the public cloud is often the preferred choice.\n\nWhat challenges did you face while managing hybrid cloud environments?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhen data is moved to the public cloud, it\u2019s primarily used for access, so it\u2019s not a significant challenge. However, the real challenge arises in terms of response times between internal and external use. Public cloud responses are generally fast when accessed from the public side, but when coming from the enterprise side, they tend to be sluggish. There are noticeable variations in response times between these two environments.\n\nWorking with vendors also presents challenges. You\u2019ll always encounter issues with them, but the real limitation lies in the depth of the solutions they provide. Vendors often lack experts who fully understand the specific systems and environments you are using. As a result, it takes time for them to grasp your unique environment and needs.\n\nHow does HPCL address vendor lock-in and ensure cost efficiency in cloud solutions?\n\nVendor lock-in is an inevitable challenge for certain critical solutions like Microsoft Office and SAP. To mitigate this, we adopt a mixed technology stack, leveraging open-source products wherever feasible to reduce costs and maintain flexibility. This strategy minimizes dependencies while optimizing expenses.\n\nHow does HPCL ensure data security and compliance across its infrastructure?\n\nWe have implemented a Zero Trust Architecture to enhance data security across platforms. Additionally, our CISO team actively monitors compliance requirements, ensuring all systems adhere to stringent security protocols.\n\nHow do you improve the resilience and flexibility of HPCL\u2019s IT infrastructure?\n\nWe focus on redundant architecture to minimize downtime. Both of our data centres are configured in High Availability (HA) mode, ensuring uninterrupted service. In the event of one data centre being unavailable, the other takes over seamlessly.\n\nWhat advancements in hybrid cloud technology would most benefit HPCL?\n\nFor our enterprise, we\u2019ve observed that there aren\u2019t many solutions available right now that span seamlessly across to the cloud. Our data growth is relatively stable and linear, not exponential, making our data and compute requirements predictable. As such, we don\u2019t anticipate sudden spikes that would necessitate the use of the cloud.\n\nHowever, given the procurement cycle involved, we do need cloud resources available during periods when we\u2019re unable to deploy our own infrastructure. Currently, not all solutions offer this flexibility. Ideally, we would prefer a solution that allows our on-prem infrastructure to seamlessly extend to the cloud.\n\nHow does HPCL stay ahead of advancements in AI and emerging technologies?\n\nWe emphasize upskilling and collaboration. Our team participates in technical and strategic courses through partnerships with leading institutes like IIMs and IITs. Additionally, we adopt an \u201cearly adopter\u201d approach\u2014piloting emerging technologies, evaluating their feasibility, and swiftly discarding those that do not align with our goals.\n\nDo you have metrics to evaluate the success of new technology implementations?\n\nYes, we have established clear success criteria for technology adoption. Solutions go through a rigorous evaluation process, and only those that meet our benchmarks are deployed.\n\nThis structured approach ensures we derive maximum value from technology investments while staying agile in a rapidly evolving landscape."

            "article_content": "This is the latest in my occasional series of conversations about Christianity, aimed at bridging America\u2019s God gulf. Here I speak with Elaine Pagels, a prominent professor of religion at Princeton University and an expert on the early church.\n\nNicholas Kristof: Merry Christmas! This is a time when Christianity celebrates \u201cMiracles and Wonder\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s the title of your fascinating forthcoming book. Your book raises questions about the virgin birth of Jesus, even pointing to ancient evidence that Jesus might have been fathered by a Roman soldier, possibly by rape. But before I ask you about that, I want to be respectful of readers who have a deep faith and may be upset by this line of inquiry. How do we follow the historical research without causing offense?\n\nElaine Pagels: I love these stories from the Gospels! The skies opened up when I heard them. They picture human lives drawn into divine mystery: \u201cGod in man made manifest,\u201d as one Christmas carol says. But at a certain point I had to ask: What do they mean? What really happened? They are not written simply as history; often they speak in metaphor. We can take them seriously without taking everything literally.\n\nKristof: So let\u2019s go back to the Nativity. Of the four Gospels, two describe the virgin birth of Jesus and two don\u2019t mention it. The Gospel of Mark has people of Galilee referring to Jesus as the son of Mary, when the norm was to describe somebody as the son of his father. So did the neighbors growing up with Jesus regard him as fatherless?\n\nPagels: We don\u2019t know. Mark is the earliest Gospel written; Matthew and Luke are basically just revising it. Mark has no suggestion of a virgin birth. Instead, he says that neighbors called Jesus \u201cson of Mary.\u201d In an intensely patriarchal society, this suggests that Jesus had no father that anyone knew about, even one deceased. Yet even without a partner, Mary has lots of children: In Mark, Jesus has four other brothers, and some sisters, with no recognized father and no genealogy.\n\nKristof: You note that Matthew and Luke both borrowed heavily from Mark\u2019s account but also seem embarrassed by elements of it, including the paternity question. Is your guess that they added the virgin birth to reduce that embarrassment?\n\nPagels: Yes, but this is not just my guess. When Matthew and Luke set out to revise Mark, each added an elaborate birth story \u2014 two stories that differ in almost every detail. Matthew adds a father named Joseph, who, seeing his fianc\u00e9e pregnant, and not with his child, decides to break the marriage contract. Luke, writing independently, pictures an angel astonishing a young virginal girl, announcing that \u201cthe Holy Spirit\u201d is about to make her pregnant.\n\nKristof: The most startling element of your book to me was that you cite evidence going back to the first and second centuries that some referred to Jesus as the son of a Roman soldier named Panthera. These accounts are mostly from early writers trying to disparage Jesus, it seems, so perhaps should be regarded skeptically. But you also write that Panthera appears to have been a real person. How should we think about this?\n\nPagels: Yes, these stories circulated after Jesus\u2019 death among members of the Jewish community who regarded him as a false messiah, saying that Jesus\u2019 father was a Roman soldier. I used to dismiss such stories as ancient slander. Yet while we do not know what happened, there are too many points of circumstantial evidence to simply ignore them. The name Panthera, sometimes spelled differently in ancient sources, may refer to a panther skin that certain soldiers wore. The discovery of the grave of a Roman soldier named Tiberius Panthera, member of a cohort of Syrian archers stationed in Palestine in the first century, might support those ancient rumors.\n\nKristof: You write that there were early accusations against Mary of promiscuity, connected to this allegation of an affair with Panthera. But you say that Roman soldiers brutally occupied Galilee in the period before Jesus was born, killing and raping with impunity. So, acknowledging that this is uncertainty stacked on uncertainty, if Panthera was involved, was it probably a case of rape?\n\nPagels: Jewish revolutionaries, fighting \u201cin the name of God and our common liberty\u201d to free their land from Roman domination, attacked a Roman fortress and killed many soldiers. The governor brought in Roman soldiers who crucified perhaps 2,000 Jews, then garrisoned thousands of soldiers less than 4 miles from Nazareth. The historian Josephus says that the soldiers stationed there ravaged the area, taking advantage of local people in every way they could. Josephus also notes that Galilean Jews were especially worried about their daughters\u2019 virginity. Noting such diverse evidence, I thought that these stories sounded plausible in a way I had never imagined.\n\nKristof: The virgin birth is just one miracle among many in the Gospels. Jesus walked on water. He raised people from the dead. He multiplied loaves and fishes. He\u2019s resurrected and ascends to heaven. So how should those of us in the 21st century see miracles?\n\nPagels: Calling something a miracle is a way of interpreting an event. A friend of mine was hit by a car and thrown about 20 feet, and was unharmed. She told me that this was a miracle. Someone else might have said, \u201cI was lucky.\u201d Calling it a miracle interprets an event that others might see differently. This often happens with remissions of illness: Some people see many miracles, and some never see any.\n\nKristof: I disagree with most evangelicals and conservative Catholics on political questions. But I also find that my fellow liberals are often deeply unfair to conservative Christians. Some of the most heroic aid work around the world is done by Christian organizations like World Vision, Catholic Relief Services and International Justice Mission. Shouldn\u2019t those of us in the liberal world be celebrating this kind of faith-based aid instead of belittling it?\n\nPagels: Absolutely. I just came from Tennessee, where I was visiting an Episcopal Church program dealing with incarcerated people. There I spoke to a group of men on death row who are taking a course of study, reading and discussing the Bible, and it was quite extraordinary.\n\nKristof: You have a foot in each of two worlds, faith and academia, that often seem like rival sides of the God gulf. Can we find paths of mutual respect to bridge that chasm?\n\nPagels: The Gospels most often speak in the language of stories and poetry. Intellectualizing these traditions \u2014 or turning them into dogma \u2014 doesn\u2019t make them spiritually deep. What we call Christianity is not a single thing. Instead, it consists of a 2,000-year-old collection of stories, prayers, liturgies, music, miracles \u2014 sources drawn from traditions as different as Eastern Orthodoxy is from Pentecostalism or Christian Science. No one can swallow the entire tradition: It\u2019s undigestible! Instead, anyone who identifies as Christian chooses certain elements of it.\n\nA professor friend said to me: \u201cI\u2019m an atheist. How can you believe all that stuff?\u201d First of all, as I see it, \u201cbelieving all that stuff\u201d is not the point. The Christian message, as I experienced it, was transformational. It encouraged me to treat other people well and opened up a world of imagination and wonder.\n\nKristof: Your own faith journey seems to bridge the chasm. You were raised in a household hostile to faith, then became an evangelical, then had a crisis when a friend died and you were told he wouldn\u2019t go to heaven because he was Jewish.\n\nPagels: When some Christians said to me that non-Christians are going to hell, I left their church. That made no sense to me. What about Jesus\u2019 message of God\u2019s love? At that point I left Christianity behind. For some people, there\u2019s no middle ground. You\u2019re either in or out \u2014 that\u2019s how it\u2019s often practiced. So for years I was out, although I knew that something powerful was there. But after years of being out, I kept wondering, what made that encounter with Christianity so powerful?\n\nSo I had to go back, asking questions. How were these stories written? How do they affect us so powerfully? They speak to a deep human longing for a sense of transcendence and spiritual experience. For we can respond to the same story in more than one way. As a historian, I question the literal truth of the virgin birth story. But I still love the midnight service on Christmas Eve, where the story is gloriously told and sung as miracle. As poet Seamus Heaney writes, \u201cBelieve that a further shore / is reachable from here. / Believe in miracles.\u201d\n\n\n\n"

Conspiracy theories about the governments of world powers are countless, although sometimes they cease to be theories and become reality.\n\nA clear example is UFOs or aliens, a belief that the US government itself has already said that it has a department exclusively to study them and that they cannot deny their existence.\n\nTrump stuns with bold new look\n\nThe five secrets of the United States\n\nHuman radiation experiments (1945-1974): For nearly three decades, US scientists exposed vulnerable people, including children and the terminally ill, to dangerous doses of radiation without their consent. Ebb Cade, an injured worker, was injected with plutonium to study its effects. These experiments remained hidden until 1994, when the Department of Energy revealed details about them\n\nIn 1994, it was revealed that they were part of Project Mogul, a spy program against the Soviet Union\n\nMKUltra (1953-1973): this secret CIA program sought to control the mind through drugs such as LSD. Experiments were conducted on civilians and agents without their consent, resulting in deaths and serious psychological damage. Although the program was exposed in 1974, many files were destroyed before they were revealed\n\nCOINTELPRO (1956-1971): The FBI spied on and sabotaged activists and political leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr. and the Black Panthers. The program came to light in 1971 after a document theft from an FBI office."

Junior\n\nMystery shrouds the skies over Belfast: what\u2019s going on?\n\nSo far this year, there have been three official reports of Unidentified Flying Object sightings (UFO) in the Greater Belfast area.\n\nThe first sighting of the year was in February, when a resident of Crumlin contacted the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) to report an object seen on January 29 with eight to ten lights around its perimeter.\n\nThe second incident occurred in the autumn, within Belfast\u2019s urban area. On October 18, a witness described a UFO leaving a vapour trail, not entirely silent, as it flew over their house and towards the docks.\n\nThe third sighting was reported on October 27 by a resident of Newtownabbey. According to the report, his wife first spotted the UFO through her camera in May and has seen it every night since. They described it as a bright light with holes on its underside.\n\nThe PSNI stated that all three reports this year were \u201cnoted for police information,\u201d without indicating that any investigations had been conducted into the sightings.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence closed its UFO desk\n\nThe number of reports has fluctuated since 2009, when the government\u2019s UFO project was cancelled, citing that in over 50 years, none of the reports received had posed a threat.\n\nWhile the police officially recorded three reports this year, it is likely that more sightings go unreported due to fears of not being taken seriously.\n\nWhat is really crossing the skies over Belfast?\n\nRead more news about Ireland\n\nExplore the latest European stories"

            "article_content": "As science continues its evolution, discoveries and technologies can act like a master key that opens doors that lead to novel advancements. Artificial intelligence is one such key, making innovations possible by solving complex problems, automating tasks and enabling research that would have been impossible, or very time-consuming, without it.\n\nBut do we want to do research on all topics, and shall we try the AI master key on every door? To explore this question, let\u2019s consider the use of AI by genomics experts as an example.\n\nIn recent years, genomics experts have added unbelievable depth to what we know about the world and ourselves. For example, genetics researchers have revealed facts about when certain animals and plants were domesticated. In another example, DNA found in 30,000-year-old permafrost was used to create fertile samples of a plant called narrow-leafed campion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportantly, genetic engineering techniques such as CRISPR facilitate extraordinary advances in the treatment of complicated conditions, such as sickle-cell anemia.\n\nThanks to AI developments, we are witnessing a dramatic increase in the pace and scalability of genomic techniques, which will allow researchers to embark on exploratory journeys \u2014 and at the same time, add urgency to already-existing ethical issues. AI companies are also most interested in the scientific implications of this technology. We see this demonstrated in a recent interview between Harvard Business School officials and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In response to the question, \u201cWhat are the pieces of AI that you are most excited about?\u201d Altman said: \u201cGreatly increasing the rate of scientific discovery is what I\u2019m most excited about.\u201d\n\nHowever, given the risks and possible consequences of AI use in science, should we rush headlong into using AI in all kinds of projects?\n\nOne relevant example is research on Neanderthals, our closest relatives, who lived until about 40,000 years ago. Neanderthals have been studied for several years now through genetic investigation of their fossils and their DNA. Genetic engineering can potentially use ancient DNA and genome editing methods to re-create a Neanderthal or aspects of a Neanderthal\u2019s genetics and physiology.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo do this, scientists could start by figuring out the DNA sequence of a Neanderthal by comparing it with the DNA of modern humans, since they are closely related. Then, scientists could use CRISPR to swap out parts of human DNA with Neanderthal DNA. This process would require a lot of trial and error and might not succeed soon, but based on what we know about genetics, if something is possible, AI can help make it happen faster, cheaper and with less effort.\n\nScientists are excited about these developments because they could facilitate new discoveries and open up many new research opportunities in genetic research.\n\nWith or without AI, research on Neanderthals will proceed, but the extraordinary power of AI could give the final push to these discoveries and facilitate this kind of resurrection. At that point, the scientific community must develop norms and guidelines about how to treat these resurrected beings with dispositions very similar to humans. We would need to carefully consider their rights and well-being almost in the same way as when humans are involved and not as research subjects or artifacts of scientific curiosity. These ethical issues are discussed in more detail in a new paper published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence.\n\nA more holistic question to consider is: Should we prioritize the use of resource-intensive AI, researchers\u2019 time and public funds to resurrect extinct beings? Or should we invest these resources into conserving species that are critically endangered today to prevent biodiversity from more degradation?\n\n_____\n\nMohammad Hosseini, Ph.D., is an assistant professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\n_____"

Our government started celebrating this day to commemorate the valour and sacrifices of the Sahibzades,\" PM Modi added.\n\nOn this occasion, he congratulated the recipients of the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar during his address.\n\n\"Today, 17 children of our nation are receiving the award in sectors like bravery, innovation, science and technology, sports and art. They have shown how capable the youth and children of India are. I congratulate them and their families. Today, I will remember when Sahibzades sacrificed their lives,\" PM Modi said.\n\nHe sheds light on the lives of Sahibzada Zorawar Singh and Sahibzada Fateh Singh, remembering their courage against the Mughal Empire.\n\n\"Sahibzada Zorawar Singh and Sahibzada Fateh Singh were young, but their courage was higher. Sahibzaade neglected the Mughal Empire and tolerated their torture...This day of Veer Baal Diwas teaches us that no matter how difficult the times are, nothing is bigger than the country and its interests, PM Modi added.\n\n\"Every work done for the country is bravery; every child and young man living for his country is 'Veer Balak.'\" This year the day is more special as it is the 75th year of the formation of our constitution. The energy of the youth has played a big role in the growth of India. India's youths have participated in every revolution,\" he stated.\n\nWhile highlighting the achievements of the country's youths, he said, \u201cFrom startups to science and from sports to entrepreneurship, our youths in the country are bringing revolution in every field.\u201d\n\nEarlier, PM Modi also met and interacted with 2024 recipients of the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar.\n\nPresident Droupadi Murmu today conferred the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar on 17 children, in seven categories, for their exceptional achievements at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan Cultural Centre.\n\nPM Modi on January 9, 2022, announced that December 26 would be marked as 'Veer Baal Diwas' as a tribute to the courage of Sahibzades (Guru Gobind Singh's sons) and their quest for justice."
