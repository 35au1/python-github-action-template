        "article_content": "Area 51 is the most famous alien base shrouded in mystery and conspiracy theories\n\nAn infamous part of America has been \"revealed\" to be the home of another alien base. A lawyer, Danny Sheehan has worked to bring UFO whistleblowers to the United States Congress over recent years. Alien base conspiracy theories have cropped up time and time again but Mr Sheehan has helped to give evidence of alleged government cover-ups involving extraterrestrial beings. There have been some serious allegations made including that at the locations of two bases, hundreds of UFOs have been seen going \u201cin and out of it\u201d. Mr Sheehan spoke on Julian Dorey\u2019s podcast about the potential location of alien bases in the US.\n\nThe Arizona mountains are allegedly home to a secret alien base\n\nHe said one base is under the sea bed off the island of Isla Guadalupe and another is hidden away on land. Mr Sheehan added: \u201cThere's another base outside of Sedona, Arizona, over by a place called 'secret mount' wilderness \u2013 a totally desolate area. \u201cThere's a base there where the craft are, there's a number of them high in the mountains in remote areas of the planet and they're here now and they're extraordinarily distressed about the state of affairs (of humanity).\u201d In terms of what lies inside, Mr Sheehan claimed aliens were \u201cmantis people\u201d who could have advanced weaponry. When asked what the \u201cmantis people\u201d are, he said: \u201cThey are huge, seven feet tall, extraordinarily skinny, thin, kind of bowed over and remind people of a praying mantis... they are also called 'insectoids'. Whenever they're seen with tall greys, they seem to be in charge... giving telepathic commands.\u201d\n\nMany conspiracy theorists are keen to share their thoughts on UFO and alien sightings\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Western Slope Paranormal is a group of local investigators studying potential hauntings.\n\nThe Elk\u2019s Lodge, Avalon Theater, and The Goat and Cover Tavern are few of the many local haunted stops on the ghost walk. Paranormal Investigator, Nina Carrillo, says activity is often detected using a flash light. During investigations she sets it in an area away from her, and asks questions promoting a response. Often times activity will reply by turning on the light, without anyone touching it.\n\nInvestigators also works with local community members and businesses to address their concerns of paranormal activity. They travel to private residencies and conduct investigations, answering questions and help provide peace of mind.\n\nWhile Halloween wraps up the ghost walks for the season, the organization remains involved with the community by hosting fundraisers and monthly meetings.

They\u2019ve carried out dozens of ghost investigations in the Oshkosh area.\n\n\n\nThose in the Oshkosh Paranormal Society have had a lifelong passion for ghosts\n\nThe group measures electricity and energy to communicate with spirits.\n\nThe Oshkosh Paranormal Society hopes to help people find peace of mind with death.\n\nIngrid Lemke says her first encounter with a spirit was early in her childhood.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a preteen, I had seen a shadow figure, and it just really terrified me,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like it was hovering over me.\u201d\n\nSince the incident, Lemke says she has had a sort of \u201csixth sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in my day, they thought you were insane, so I only told my friends,\u201d she says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until her adulthood that Lemke would find a large group of like-minded people and create what is now the Oshkosh Paranormal Society.\n\nLemke says it was validating finding others with a similar connection to ghosts and spirits.\n\n\u201cIt feels wonderful, it feels freeing,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Oshkosh Paranormal Society started as a group of Lemke and her coworkers, but now is a large Facebook group.\n\nMany in the group also had paranormal experiences as children.\n\n\u201cI think I was about eight,\u201d Emily Kampmann, a member of the group, says. \u201cI kind of woke up on the floor one day in my bedroom, and I was staring at my closet\u2026. and the door was wide open and there was glowing lights, like eyeballs staring at me. I know it sounds silly.\u201d\n\nThe group gets together to do paranormal investigations in haunted areas around Oshkosh. They\u2019ve investigated the local cemetery, The Grand Oshkosh, the Algoma Club and multiple personal homes.\n\nLemke says the downtown area near the Algoma Club and the Grand Oshkosh seem to be particularly haunted, which she believes is due to Oshkosh\u2019s two 19th century fires.\n\n\u201cOur investigations are generally scientific,\u201d Lemke says.\n\nThe group relies on different types of instruments and tools to pick up on energy shifts in the air. Some of the tools are used by electricians to track electricity.\n\n\u201cSo the theory is that spirits are energy, so when they get close to that, it triggers it,\u201d Jason Tiffany, a member of the group, says.\n\nThey also use recording devices to pick up on voices they wouldn\u2019t normally hear.\n\nLemke says they find a lot of evidence after the investigation ends and they\u2019re able to rewatch the footage.\n\n\u201cIt takes many hours,\u201d Lemke says.\n\nThe Algoma Club in Oshkosh was a speakeasy during prohibition, and Lemke says they\u2019ve found lots of evidence of prohibition-era spirits roaming the space.\n\n\"It's definitely a heavy presence,\" Lilly Heft, another member of the group says of the Algoma Club. \"I feel spooky in here.\"\n\nDespite the many hours that go into each investigation, the group says they are always fun.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s an adrenaline rush, but it kind of is,\u201d Heft says.\n\nHeft says she\u2019s a \u201chardcore believer\u201d in ghosts, but that\u2019s not true for everyone in the group.\n\n\u201cIf you hear a voice, you know, understanding that, is that your brain just trying to figure out what\u2019s going on?\" Stephanie Whittaker, another member of the group says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just, well for me anyways, you can\u2019t just let your imagination run away with you.\u201d\n\nWhittaker says she\u2019s a \u201cskeptic,\u201d and often questions the evidence the group collects. Still, there are some findings that she says are hard to deny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve, with the group, had enough experiences that I can\u2019t explain,\u201d she says.\n\nMore than the thrill of finding ghosts, the Oshkosh Paranormal Society hopes to use its passion to help people.\n\n\u201cMy favorite aspect of our group is when we help people in their personal houses,\u201d Lemke says. \u201cBecause they\u2019ve felt like I did when I was a kid\u2014 who do I reach out to? Who do I trust with this? I know how that feels not having any validation.\u201d\n\nLemke says she\u2019s helped expel angry spirits from homes, as well as give people the confirmation that they\u2019re not imagining things.\n\nFor Kampmann, she thinks the group can help on a deeper level\u2014 giving comfort around death.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really neat to experiment with that and show people that there is life after death in some form, to not be like somewhat scared of death even,\u201d she says.\n\nMore information on the group can be found on their Facebook page.\n\n"

It is newsworthy when archeologists and paleontologists find a new location that contains fossils, but what about the first fossil discovery?\n\nChrissy: The earliest recorded discovery of a remnant of dinosaur history was in 1676 when Robert Plot found a huge thigh bone in England. Back in the early 17th century, dinosaurs weren't something that were part of public common knowledge, so these finds were either thought to belong to huge humans or mythical creatures.\n\nJasmine: It wasn't until the early 1800's that it was suspected that giant animals once roamed the earth and not giant humans. Gideon Mantell found a gigantic fossil while digging in the Sussex quarry which turned out to be one of the first known lguanodon teeth to ever be found. This was a key turning point in how scientists dug for and classified fossils.\n\nChrissy: A quest for paleontology supremacy brought forth the discovery of many new dinosaur genre during the American Gilded Age of the 19th Century. \"The Bone Wars\", a fierce and underhanded competition between Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope, saw the use of bribery, theft, destruction of bones, funding tampering, and public attacks in scientific publications that went on to publicly ruin both men financially and in reputation. Their losses brought forth gains for the Stegosaurus, Allosaurus, and Triceratops.\n\nJasmine: In the mid 1800's the word \"dinosaur\" was first coined by Sir Richard Owen, an English biologist and paleontologist. He recognized these giant ancient animals as the order of Dinosauria and began the modern era of dinosaur research and classification.\n\nChrissy: You've been listening to The Sound of Science on WNIJ, where you learn something new every day."

        "article_content": "Hidden deep in the frosty expanse of the Greenland Ice Sheet, an intriguing secret has been lurking \u2013 a significant amount of meltwater temporarily held within its icy mantle during the summertime.\n\nIt\u2019s a discovery that not only challenges our existing understanding of ice sheets and their role in sea-level rise but also signals the need for a paradigm shift in climate change models.\n\nA mystery on the Greenland ice sheet\n\nDespite being the largest single contributor to global sea-level rise, scientists have so far been unable to answer how the storage of meltwater within the Greenland Ice Sheet evolves throughout the summer melt season.\n\nHowever, a unique approach has now offered significant insight into the movement and storage of this meltwater. The research was led by Jiangjun Ran, a professor in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the Southern University of Science and Technology in China.\n\n\u201cDuring the melt season, we found that a significant fraction of meltwater mass is stored temporarily within the ice sheet. This water buffering effect peaks in July and slowly recedes in the following weeks,\u201d noted Professor Ran.\n\nWater dynamics within the ice sheet\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how water is stored and released within the ice sheet has always been a challenge,\u201d said Pavel Ditmar, a scientist in the Department of Geoscience and Remote Sensing at Delft University of Technology.\n\nTo overcome this, the team turned to data from the Greenland GPS Network (GNET). The network consists of tens of stations around Greenland, providing continuous positioning data.\n\nThe data was used to develop a method capable of interpreting the detected vertical displacements of the bedrock caused, among other things, by the mass of melting water.\n\nReshaping climate models\n\nThis discovery could revolutionize climate models, which often fail to capture the intricacy of water storage within ice sheets.\n\nEspecially in warmer years, these models may underestimate the process of water runoff towards the ocean.\n\nThe researchers found that the predictions could require scaling adjustments of up to 20% for the warmest years.\n\n\u201cThese findings are crucial for improving forecasts of the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s contribution to future sea-level rise,\u201d said Michiel van den Broeke, a scholar from Utrecht University.\n\n\u201cWith climate change making the Arctic warmer than ever, accurate predictions are essential for preparing coastal regions for potential sea-level rise.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding ice sheet dynamics\n\nThis significant breakthrough in understanding the behavior of polar ice wasn\u2019t an overnight success. It required years of meticulous preparation and arduous expeditions to remote corners of the planet.\n\nShfaqat Abbas Khan, a scholar from the Technical University of Denmark noted: \u201cThe work we\u2019ve done not only improves our understanding of ice sheet dynamics but also opens the door to new measurement techniques and campaigns.\u201d\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the discovery highlights the importance of international collaboration in confronting our shared environmental challenges, as we continue our journey to protect the delicate balance of life on this planet.\n\nClimate insights from Greenland\u2019s ice sheet\n\nThe impact of these new findings extends beyond Greenland\u2019s icy borders. If similar meltwater storage mechanisms exist in other ice-covered regions, such as Antarctica or the Himalayas, climate models may need further adjustments.\n\nBy factoring in these complex water storage processes, scientists can refine global sea-level rise predictions and provide more accurate timelines.\n\nThis broader understanding can help nations better prepare for climate impacts on coastal communities and freshwater supplies, highlighting the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s role in shaping the global climate.\n\nThis breakthrough would not have been possible without advancements in technology.\n\nTools like the Greenland GPS Network (GNET) have revolutionized the way scientists gather data, providing real-time insights into changes deep within the ice.\n\nThe use of these advanced techniques, from GPS-based monitoring to satellite imagery, is paving the way for further discoveries in polar research.\n\nWith these tools, researchers hope to continue uncovering Greenland\u2019s secrets and apply these findings to other remote and difficult-to-study ice sheets, accelerating the pace of climate science.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Nature.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

        "date": "1h",
        "source": "TechRepublic",
        "article_content": "Generative AI is as trendy as it has ever been.\n\nThis year, research into AI was awarded Nobel Prizes, and the largest tech companies in the world pumped AI into as many products as possible. The U.S. government promoted AI as a driver in creating a clean-energy economy and a strategic pillar for federal spending. But what\u2019s next for 2025?\n\nThe trend of generative AI in the last few months of 2024 points to a greater push for adoption from tech companies. Meanwhile, the results as to whether AI products and processes see ROI for enterprise software buyers are mixed. While it\u2019s difficult to foresee how AI will continue to shape the tech industry, experts have offered predictions based on current trends.\n\nRespondents to an IEEE study in September rated AI as one of the top three areas of technology that will be most critical in 2025 in 58% of cases. Conversely, nearly all respondents (91%) agree that 2025 will see \u201ca generative AI reckoning\u201d regarding what the technology can or should do. Expectations for generative AI are high, but the success of projects leveraging it remains uncertain.\n\n1. AI agents will be the next buzzword\n\nBased on my research and observations, the use of AI agents will surge in 2025.\n\nAI agents are semi-autonomous generative AI that can chain together or interact with applications to carry out instructions in an unstructured environment. For example, Salesforce uses AI agents to call sales leads. As with generative AI, the definition of an agent\u2019s capabilities is unclear. IBM defines it as an AI that can reason through complex problems, such as OpenAI o1. However, not all products billed as AI agents can reason that way.\n\nRegardless of their capabilities, AI agents and their use cases will likely be at the forefront of generative AI marketing in 2025. AI \u201cagents\u201d could be the next stage of evolution for this year\u2019s AI \u201ccopilots.\u201d AI agents could spend time working through multi-stage jobs independently while their human counterpart handles another task.\n\n2. AI will both help and hurt security teams\n\nBoth cybersecurity attackers and defenders will continue to take advantage of AI in 2025. 2024 has already seen the proliferation of generative AI security products. These products can write code, detect threats, answer thorny questions, or serve as a \u201crubber duck\u201d for brainstorming.\n\nBut generative AI may present information that is inaccurate. Security professionals may spend as much time double-checking the output as they would if they had performed the work themselves. Failing to review such information can lead to broken code and even more security issues.\n\n\u201cAs AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini become deeply integrated into business operations, the risk of accidental data exposure skyrockets with new data privacy challenges,\u201d Jeremy Fuchs, cyber security evangelist at Check Point Software Technologies, said in an email to TechRepublic. \u201cIn 2025, organizations must move swiftly to implement strict controls and governance over AI usage, ensuring the benefits of these technologies don\u2019t come at the cost of data privacy and security.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI models are susceptible to malicious actors like any other software, particularly via jailbreak attacks.\n\n\u201cAI\u2019s growing role in cyber crime is undeniable,\u201d Fuchs explained. \u201cBy 2025, AI will not only enhance the scale of attacks but also their sophistication. Phishing attacks will be harder to detect, with AI continuously learning and adapting.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI can make conventional methods of identifying phishing emails \u2014 poor grammar or out-of-the-blue messages \u2014 obsolete. Disinformation security will become more important as AI-generated videos, audio, and text proliferate. As a result, security teams must adapt to both using and defending against generative AI \u2014 just as they have adapted to other significant changes in business technology, such as the large-scale migration to the cloud.\n\n3. Businesses will evaluate whether AI delivers ROI\n\n\u201cThe pendulum has swung from \u2018new AI innovation at any cost\u2019 to a resounding imperative to prove ROI in board rooms across the world,\u201d Uzi Dvir, global CIO at digital adoption platform company WalkMe, said in an email. \u201cSimilarly, employees are asking themselves if it\u2019s worth the time and effort to figure out how to use these new technologies for their specific roles.\u201d\n\nOrganizations struggle to determine whether generative AI adds value and to what use cases it can make the most difference. Organizations that adopt AI often face high costs and unclear goals. It can be difficult to quantify the benefits of generative AI use, where those benefits manifest, and what to compare them to.\n\nThis challenge is a side effect of the integration of generative AI into many other applications. It makes some decision-makers wonder whether generative AI add-ons truly boost the value of those applications. AI tiers can be costly, and over the next year, more companies are expected to rigorously test \u2014 and sometimes discard \u2014 the features that don\u2019t deliver results.\n\nMany companies that are incorporating generative AI at a large scale are seeing success. At its Q3 earnings call, Google attributed this result to its AI infrastructure and products such as AI Overviews. However, Meta reported that AI may significantly increase capital expenditures, even as user numbers decline.\n\nSEE: Google Cloud is previewing its sixth generation of the AI accelerator Trillium.\n\n4. AI will make a major impact on scientific research\n\nAlong with impacting enterprise productivity, contemporary AI has seen significant movement in science.\n\nFour of 2024\u2019s Nobel Prize winners used AI:\n\nDemis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google DeepMind won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for predicting the structure of proteins with AlphaFold2.\n\nJohn J. Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the Nobel Prize for Physics for their decades-spanning work developing neural networks.\n\nThe White House held a summit on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 about the use of AI in life sciences, highlighting how AI enables solutions to complex challenges in ways that impact the world. This trend is likely to continue into next year as generative AI models grow and mature.\n\n5. The environmental tools made with AI won\u2019t offset its energy toll\n\nEnergy efficiency is another buzzword in AI.\n\nBut for every use case in which AI can help predict weather patterns or optimize energy use, there is another story about the environmental cost of building the data centers needed to run generative AI. Such construction requires massive amounts of electricity and water \u2014 and rising global temperatures only compound the problem. It\u2019s unlikely an equilibrium will be reached in this large-scale problem.\n\nFor businesses, though, expect to see companies touting dubious and genuine claims of energy savings and environmental friendliness around AI. Consider the resource use attached to your organization\u2019s AI strategy.\n\nWhat are the most popular generative AI products?\n\nThe most well-known generative AI products are:\n\nChatGPT, the OpenAI chatbot\n\nGoogle Gemini\n\nMicrosoft Copilot\n\nGPT-4, the large language model behind ChatGPT\n\nDALL-E 3, an image generator\n\nWhat is the most advanced generative AI?\n\nVarious tests have been proposed as potential criteria for determining the most advanced generative AI. Some organizations rate their models on human educational benchmarks, such as the International Mathematics Olympiad or Codeforce competitions.\n\nOther evaluations, such as Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding, were explicitly created for generative AI. Google\u2019s Gemini Ultra, China Mobile\u2019s Jiutian, and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o sit at the top of the MMLU leaderboard today."
