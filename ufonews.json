            "article_content": "We need less uproar over everyday drones and more critical attention about ones near airports and other restricted airspace\n\nDecember\u2019s spate of drone sightings seen in New Jersey and spreading nationwide, sure looks familiar. As does its associated media frenzy\u2014culminating in memes and conspiracy theories about so-called \u201cmystery drones.\u201d The episode bears an eerie resemblance to the UFO phenomenon, or the unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) one, that spiked in recent years and has led to significant congressional attention and legislation.\n\nIn a way, this is progress. The reason this outbreak looks so familiar is that such drone sightings would previously have been identified as UAP ones. It\u2019s only after years of concerted efforts in education, and transparency by U.S. Department of Defense officials, that UAP sightings have rightfully evolved into common drone identification. That is not to say that the drone sightings are any less of a concern, but fortunately, we can address them without the contagion of the UFO community and the conspiracies associated with it.\n\nUnfortunately, our response has been no less irrational.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nA New Jersey state assemblyman has accused federal officials of \u201clying to us\u201d about drones on CNN. The president-elect suggested we \u201cshoot them down!!!\u201d which is almost (but only almost, sadly) needless to say, a bad idea. So is wasting resources to investigate nonsensical notions of advanced technology related to Iran or, again, aliens. Calls for shooting objects down not only have obvious safety issues but fail to recall that Congress and the White House limited such strikes over U.S. territory after the incidents involving the Chinese high-altitude balloon and other balloons, based on concerns about civilian safety.\n\nThere are a couple of things we need to make clear about the drone sightings. First, many of the sightings remain mistaken interpretations of manned aircraft or satellites such as Starlink ones. The real drone sightings fall into two classes: those that are in restricted airspace, and those that are in legal airspace. Restricted airspace surrounds airports as well as national security areas such as Air Force and Navy bases. Most sightings reported fall within the latter category and have been assessed as having no immediate national security or flight safety risk, although the public finds them annoying.\n\nOne fact that many people tend to overlook, or at least don\u2019t readily rationalize, is that these drones have lights on them. That lights are present on various flying objects including drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs) is a fact I often referred to in my last job, heading a Pentagon office investigating UAP sightings. Lights on a drone are for collision avoidance. They are a safety feature. Flying drones with lights ensures they can be seen; if they were meant to be unnoticed, the operators would turn off or disable the lights. In September 2023, the FAA changed the rules to allow drones to fly at night this way, and this is likely a contributing factor to the increase in sightings. The public and elected officials in Congress continue to believe lights in the sky are scary, however, particularly when they mistake crewed aircraft for drones.\n\nCongressional officials and that unfortunate source of information, social media, continue to make unfounded claims of drone technologies far ahead of U.S. capabilities. The most recent example being the assertion that drones flew from an Iranian mother ship off the coast of the U.S. and demonstrated seven or eight hours of battery life. That fantastic assertion requires there to be evidence that the drones originated from an Iranian ship and were tracked continuously to the U.S. cities. There are no such tracks. The more rational explanation is that they originated near the place of the sighting, that is from domestic operators.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean some drone operations aren\u2019t ill-intentioned.\n\nSeveral hypotheses (apart from mistaken identity) might explain these drones in legal airspace. They might be academic, professional or hobbyist domestic operators exploring a new technology. YouTube overflows with drone footage from amateur photographers all over the world. Flying in urban settings, in legal airspace, for photography or maybe even some research such as high resolution thermal or pollution measurements is very plausible. Or they are commercial. Increased commercial activity is unavoidable as industry advances drone technology for delivery, remote sensing and communications.\n\nMore concerning, operators could be probing the limits of legal activities, or in military speak, performing or exploring preparation of the battlespace. Whether foreign or domestic bad actors, they could be flying commercial drones, complete with lights, to test reactions of both the public and the government. As long as they are flying within legal airspace, under legal limits, they can push those limits and measure what the reaction is. That information on reactions and response could readily feed back to some sort of attack planning, illegal drug delivery or other malicious intent.\n\nFinally, the operators could be using them intentionally to whip up frenzy, hysteria and panic. It could be for personal gain (such as claiming they have the anti-UAV solution to sell), or perhaps advertising something resembling another History Channel series on aliens.\n\nMuch like the UAP problem, there is little evidence to support, or rule out, any of these hypotheses. Like UAP, the drones don\u2019t likely all have the same explanation. That makes it hard from a national security perspective to distinguish when a sighting is benign versus potentially nefarious. Lest we forget the lessons of the ongoing war on Ukraine, we don\u2019t want to be caught in an intelligence or technical surprise.\n\nMeanwhile, the sightings that are clearly in restricted airspace usually have more obvious intentions. These can range from benign to nefarious, but generally center around seeing things that are normally not allowed. Whether this is military aircraft, commercial airports or operations, these clearly identified drones and balloons with payloads pose not only a security risk but also a flight safety risk. It would only take one small quad copter to get sucked into a commercial jet engine to end in tragedy.\n\nThe proliferation of drone technology, in its commercial, recreational, scientific and military uses, is clearly disrupting the world around us. Our legislation and regulation have created an environment that allows for legal drone usage. It should come as no surprise then that drones are in the air and increasing. Yet here we are, once again with more extraordinary claims, public demands for transparency, baseless accusations of hiding the truth, and congressional calls for more legislation over a mystery in the sky, instead of a rational scientific approach to the investigation. Sound familiar?\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nA man who says he spent over 25 years in the military recently described his terrifying encounter with a bright UFO he saw while camping in California. During the course of describing the harrowing event, he said it was like nothing he had ever experienced before.\n\nHe described the UFO as being 20 to 30 feet in length and 8 to 10 feet in height. He also stated that the mysterious craft was oval-shaped, emitted a white light, and got to within 100 yards of his campsite in Mountain Center, Calif.\n\n\u201cAt approximately 11:00 p.m. I was laying in the tarped bed of my truck in the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsites at about 7,800 foot elevation,\u201d the military veteran wrote in his report that was submitted to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). \u201cI was the only camper/hunter in the area that night and it was pitch black out.\n\n\u201cInstantly, everything (all natural animal/insect noises) went completely silent and the entire area lit up brighter than the brightest full moon I\u2019ve ever seen. But I knew it wasn\u2019t the moon because I had already located the moon prior to that and it was a dimly lit waning gibbous.\n\n\u201cThinking a really quiet truck was pulling into the campground with its headlights on, I peeked out from under the tarp and saw a stationary, bright white light, about 20-30 foot in length (about the size of a medium sized helicopter but with the light encompassing the entire object), hovering at tree top level, behind an about 30-40 foot tall pine tree, only about 100 yards away. It made absolutely no noise, didn\u2019t pulsate or move, and did not radiate any sort of heat (it was about 40 degrees Fahrenheit that evening).\n\n\u201cI observed it for at least a minute before fear took over and I sank back down into the bed of my truck and into my sleeping bag. Therefore I have no idea what it did or where it moved after that. I must\u2019ve fell asleep and didn\u2019t come back out of my sleeping bag until approximately 2:30 a.m., drenched in sweat, at which time it was gone, and everything was pitch black again.\n\n\u201cI was completely sober and not tired nor sleep deprived at the time of this sighting. I stayed the next night at the same campsite (only because I didn\u2019t recall this incident until two days later) and did not experience any further bright lights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m no expert tracker, but I did not notice any out of the ordinary tracks or signs in the vicinity of the sighting over the next two days. I\u2019ve backpacked/hunted the backcountry routinely for the past 15 years, spent over 25 years in the military, and I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this before.\u201d\n\nThis military veteran\u2019s story has gained credence recently due to the numerous unexplained drone slash UFO sightings that have been taking place all over the United States.\n\nIn addition to the widely-publicized drone sightings over New Jersey, there have also been reports made in Ohio, in San Diego County and other parts of Southern California, over Bowie, Maryland, and at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nOn top of those strange witness reports, RadarOnline.com recently obtained new photos and video of some of the suspected drones that have been terrorizing residents around Staten Island.\n\nThe media outlet also reports similar sightings have been reported in Connecticut, Florida, and Massachusetts. Those drone sightings and many others are now being tracked by an interactive map published by DailyMail.com."

            "article_content": "Most people, when they think about AI, focus on applications such as image generation or chatbots. But as we're starting to learn, there is so much more to artificial intelligence than these simple tools.\n\nAs well as the high-specification AI products, which help with science, deep research and other heavyweight needs, AI is also extremely useful in the softer sciences.\n\nOur existence is made up of relationships \u2014 work, family, friendships, they're all part of the important mix of life. So let's take a quick look and see how our computerized friend can help us navigate the tricky waters around our important social activities.\n\nIt's important to remember, however, that AI will never be a substitute for real-life engagement or professional guidance. This is just an example of how you can use AI, not professional advice.\n\n1. Communications\n\nSo much of the hard work relating to relationships comes from simply navigating communications. It's no surprise that large language models, which are the bedrock of today's AI, excel at language. We can use this ability to significantly improve our interactions.\n\nA growing number of people use their chatbot as a sounding board, to ask for advice on how to deal with tricky communications. Things said or unsaid.\n\nA simple tool is to give ChatGPT something you plan to send to a friend, loved one or even a colleague and ask: \"Can I phrase this better?\"\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n2. Conflict resolution\n\nInterview roleplay with GPT-4o voice and vision - YouTube Watch On\n\nOne of the sad but true facts about relationships is the fact that they involve a fair amount of conflict in one way or another. Chatbots can offer feedback on tricky episodes, as well as suggestions for how to overcome certain positions.\n\nEven asking simple questions about how to apologize, or requesting help with mediation is a valuable way to use the power of AI language.\n\nFor those who need something a little more structured, the Flamme app may be a worthwhile investment. It offers a wide range of options and is available on iPhone and Android. Essentially, it offers advice on interacting with your partner every day including tips and information.\n\n3. Mental Health\n\nAgain, this is not advice, merely a list of tips and apps you can use with AI.\n\nThere's a growing palette of AI tools being deployed for mental health applications. These cover the range from simple mood apps, which check your current state of mind and help to improve it, to deep therapy products which are designed to work alongside professional mental health services.\n\nOne such tool is Youper, which is a CBT chatbot designed to help people with emotional issues. Always check with medical professionals.\n\n4. Organizational tool\n\nA lot of the negative issues arising out of relationships come from simple bad planning. Forgetting appointments, losing track of obligations or simply not contributing our share to a workload. Again AI can come to the rescue through the use of a variety of tools to help manage these kinds of daily demands.\n\nThe free Trevor AI app is one such example amongst many. It combines an AI assistant with an organizer, to-do list manager and more.\n\n5. Social skills aid\n\nHave you ever wished you were more socially adept? You're not alone, millions of people across the world feel like they fail to cope with basic social skills. We can use artificial intelligence to help practice these skills, because they can be learned just like any other skill.\n\nRole-playing, active listening sessions and empathy exercises are all part of the things we can use to improve ourselves.\n\nThere are a number of commercial apps which can be used for this purpose, although many are just wrappers for the standard AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic and the rest. It's probably just as valid to use a standard chatbot in the first instance.\n\n6. Memory aid\n\nIt pays to remember the simple things in our relationships. Even banal issues like forgetting birthdays or anniversaries can be a cause of conflict and discord.\n\nBy using AI technology to manage our memory, calendar or even alarm clock, we can encourage smooth sailing in every way.\n\nSetting reminders for gift ideas is a very quick win. This type of feature is likely to become more common in standard AI models as the memory functions improve over time.\n\n7. General relationships\n\nIt may sound a little excessive, but by using an AI advisor to help us with relationship expectations at the beginning of an important life journey, we can proactively prevent issues down the line.\n\nWe can also use AI to help us with cultural and language gaps which may occur in our personal interactions.\n\nFinally, using AI to help with relationship goal setting in a collaborative way can be very useful. By working together on these kinds of tasks, we can probably strengthen the depth of our connection in subtle but important ways."

            "article_content": "By HEATHER HOLLINGSWORTH, Associated Press\n\nFor Makenzie Gilkison, spelling is such a struggle that a word like rhinoceros might come out as \u201crineanswsaurs\u201d or sarcastic as \u201csrkastik.\u201d\n\nThe 14-year-old from suburban Indianapolis can sound out words, but her dyslexia makes the process so draining that she often struggles with comprehension. \u201cI just assumed I was stupid,\u201d she recalled of her early grade school years.\n\nBut assistive technology powered by artificial intelligence has helped her keep up with classmates. Last year, Makenzie was named to the National Junior Honor Society. She credits a customized AI-powered chatbot, a word prediction program and other tools that can read for her.\n\n\u201cI would have just probably given up if I didn\u2019t have them,\u201d she said.\n\nArtificial intelligence holds the promise of helping countless other students with a range of visual, speech, language and hearing impairments to execute tasks that come easily to others. Schools everywhere have been wrestling with how and where to incorporate AI, but many are fast-tracking applications for students with disabilities.\n\nGetting the latest technology into the hands of students with disabilities is a priority for the U.S. Education Department, which has told schools they must consider whether students need tools like text-to-speech and alternative communication devices. New rules from the Department of Justice also will require schools and other government entities to make apps and online content accessible to those with disabilities.\n\nThere is concern about how to ensure students using it \u2014 including those with disabilities \u2014 are still learning.\n\nStudents can use artificial intelligence to summarize jumbled thoughts into an outline, summarize complicated passages, or even translate Shakespeare into common English. And computer-generated voices that can read passages for visually impaired and dyslexic students are becoming less robotic and more natural.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing that a lot of students are kind of exploring on their own, almost feeling like they\u2019ve found a cheat code in a video game,\u201d said Alexis Reid, an educational therapist in the Boston area who works with students with learning disabilities. But in her view, it is far from cheating: \u201cWe\u2019re meeting students where they are.\u201d\n\nBen Snyder, a 14-year-old freshman from Larchmont, New York, who was recently diagnosed with a learning disability, has been increasingly using AI to help with homework.\n\n\u201cSometimes in math, my teachers will explain a problem to me, but it just makes absolutely no sense,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if I plug that problem into AI, it\u2019ll give me multiple different ways of explaining how to do that.\u201d\n\nHe likes a program called Question AI. Earlier in the day, he asked the program to help him write an outline for a book report \u2014 a task he completed in 15 minutes that otherwise would have taken him an hour and a half because of his struggles with writing and organization. But he does think using AI to write the whole report crosses a line.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just cheating,\u201d Ben said.\n\nSchools have been trying to balance the technology\u2019s benefits against the risk that it will do too much. If a special education plan sets reading growth as a goal, the student needs to improve that skill. AI can\u2019t do it for them, said Mary Lawson, general counsel at the Council of the Great City Schools.\n\nBut the technology can help level the playing field for students with disabilities, said Paul Sanft, director of a Minnesota-based center where families can try out different assistive technology tools and borrow devices.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely going to be people who use some of these tools in nefarious ways. That\u2019s always going to happen,\u201d Sanft said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the biggest concern with people with disabilities, who are just trying to do something that they couldn\u2019t do before.\u201d\n\nAnother risk is that AI will track students into less rigorous courses of study. And, because it is so good at identifying patterns, AI might be able to figure out a student has a disability. Having that disclosed by AI and not the student or their family could create ethical dilemmas, said Luis P\u00e9rez, the disability and digital inclusion lead at CAST, formerly the Center for Applied Specialized Technology.\n\nSchools are using the technology to help students who struggle academically, even if they do not qualify for special education services. In Iowa, a new law requires students deemed not proficient \u2014 about a quarter of them \u2014 to get an individualized reading plan. As part of that effort, the state\u2019s education department spent $3 million on an AI-driven personalized tutoring program. When students struggle, a digital avatar intervenes.\n\nMore AI tools are coming soon.\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation is funding AI research and development. One firm is developing tools to help children with speech and language difficulties. Called the National AI Institute for Exceptional Education, it is headquartered at the University of Buffalo, which did pioneering work on handwriting recognition that helped the U.S. Postal Service save hundreds of millions of dollars by automating processing.\n\n\u201cWe are able to solve the postal application with very high accuracy. When it comes to children\u2019s handwriting, we fail very badly,\u201d said Venu Govindaraju, the director of the institute. He sees it as an area that needs more work, along with speech-to-text technology, which isn\u2019t as good at understanding children\u2019s voices, particularly if there is a speech impediment.\n\nSorting through the sheer number of programs developed by education technology companies can be a time-consuming challenge for schools. Richard Culatta, CEO of the International Society for Technology in Education, said the nonprofit launched an effort this fall to make it easier for districts to vet what they are buying and ensure it is accessible.\n\nMakenzie wishes some of the tools were easier to use. Sometimes a feature will inexplicably be turned off, and she will be without it for a week while the tech team investigates. The challenges can be so cumbersome that some students resist the technology entirely.\n\nBut Makenzie\u2019s mother, Nadine Gilkison, who works as a technology integration supervisor at Franklin Township Community School Corporation in Indiana, said she sees more promise than downside.\n\nIn September, her district rolled out chatbots to help special education students in high school. She said teachers, who sometimes struggled to provide students the help they needed, became emotional when they heard about the program. Until now, students were reliant on someone to help them, unable to move ahead on their own.\n\n\u201cNow we don\u2019t need to wait anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Associated Press\u2019 education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            "article_content": "Urban legends anime has a long history of adapting Japanese urban myths and folktales into shows that fuse horror, mystery, and the supernatural. Many anime series draw from ancient paranormal tales passed down through generations, keeping folklore alive in modern storytelling.\n\nThese anime effectively incorporate elements of drama and suspense with vengeful spirits, unexplained deaths, cursed rituals, and other phenomena to make for creepy and addictive viewing experiences.\n\nRanging from violent tragedies to more subtle atmospheric chillers, here are 10 urban legends anime that bring age-old superstitions and mysticism to terrifying life on screen.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in the copy are those of the writer.\n\n10 must-watch urban legends anime inspired by japanese folklore\n\n1. Another\n\nTrending\n\nAnother (Image via P.A. Works)\n\nSet in the small town of Yomiyama in 1998, this urban legends anime explores the sinister phenomenon surrounding class 3-3 at Yomiyama North Middle School, which suffers from a long-running curse tied to a student named Misaki who died in 1972.\n\nWhen K\u014dichi Sakakibara transfers into class 3-3, he soon becomes embroiled in the supernatural mystery and tries investigating the true nature of the curse along with his enigmatic classmate Mei Misaki.\n\nWith foreboding music and viscerally violent death scenes, Another creates an oppressively bleak atmosphere portraying the protagonist's growing desperation as the class succumbs to more bizarre casualties at the hands of a vengeful spirit refusing to rest in peace.\n\n2. Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories\n\nYamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories (Image via ILCA)\n\nThis unique anime adapts classic Japanese supernatural myths and ghost stories into a series of short vignettes narrated by a mysterious man wearing a traditional festival mask and inspired by the Kamishibai paper theater tradition.\n\nRanging from the subtly creepy to the scarily surreal, each chilling tale borrows from the vast folklore surrounding spirits rooted in familiar locales seeking justice or unfinished business with the living.\n\nThe minimalist animation style, using moving cutouts, sets a chilling tone for stories of vengeful ghosts, ancient curses, and haunted artifacts, often ending bleakly for those who ignore warnings. With its traditional J-horror vibes, Yamishibai is a quintessential urban legends anime.\n\n3. Ghost Hunt\n\nGhost Hunt (Image via J.C. Staff)\n\nWhen her high school\u2019s paranormal rumors lead her to investigate, Mai Taniyama meets eccentric 17-year-old Kazuya Shibuya, president of Shibuya Psychic Research Center\u2014a group that investigates supernatural phenomena using scientific and spiritual techniques.\n\nSkeptical at first, Mai joins Kazuya's investigations into hauntings, possessions, and eerie schools. As their cases unfold, Mai and Kazuya join forces with a priest, a monk, a shrine maiden, a medium, and a technician to confront curses, spirits, and supernatural events tied to Japanese urban legends.\n\nAired in 2006 with above-average animation from J.C.Staff, Ghost Hunt offers a modern spin on urban legends anime that blends science and spirituality.\n\n4. Boogiepop Phantom\n\nBoogiepop Phantom (Image via Madhouse)\n\nSet in Shinyo City, Boogiepop Phantom portrays a series of strange occurrences that arise after the rumored appearance of an enigmatic entity, Boogiepop.\n\nThese events intertwine with urban legends and supernatural phenomena affecting the city\u2019s residents. Boogiepop Phantom has an avant-garde presentation style as it keeps shifting non-chronologically between various snapshots of the unusual happenings around town seen from diverse viewpoints.\n\nThis anime has all the makings of a classic urban legends anime filled with death, disappearances, and terrifying creatures inspired by existential dread and urban myths.\n\n5. Mononoke\n\nMononoke (Image via Toei Animation)\n\nThe mysterious character known only as the Medicine Seller travels around feudal Japan, dealing with malevolent spirits called mononoke that linger due to unresolved conflicts and regrets.\n\nEach self-contained arc introduces the mononoke's origins and the spiritual conflict behind it before the elaborate exorcism rituals begin once their Form, Truth, and Reason are uncovered.\n\nWith a unique visual aesthetic reminiscent of traditional Japanese art blended with psychedelic colors, Mononoke is a treat for the senses while giving viewers genuinely frightening tales rooted in Japan's rich folklore. Its haunting narrative firmly secures it as a memorable urban legends anime.\n\n6. Hell Girl\n\nHell Girl (Image via Studio Deen)\n\nHell Girl centers around the legend of Ai Enma, a young girl sacrificed as part of a village ritual, later becoming Hell Girl and granted the power to take vengeance on behalf of others who have been greatly wronged.\n\nIf someone accesses the Hell Link website at midnight and enters their tormentor's name, Ai will appear to offer them a straw doll. If they pull the red string, their target will immediately be taken to hell. But there is always a steep price to be paid.\n\nWith themes of anger, justice, bullying, and regret, each mini-arc explores the circumstances that drive seemingly ordinary folks past their breaking point. Hell Girl stands out as a gripping urban legends anime delving into themes of revenge and consequence.\n\n7. The Lost Village\n\nThe Lost Village (Image via Diomed\u00e9a)\n\n30 people signed up in a highly exclusive retreat to a secluded village nestled deep in the mountains.\n\nAccording to local lore, the village was rumored to have vanished under mysterious circumstances. Upon arriving there, unsettling things begin to happen as the group members start dying in strange ways.\n\nBorrowing from horror tropes and themes of psychological suspense, The Lost Village keeps viewers guessing as cryptic clues are revealed about the true nature of various characters and the creature stalking them. It\u2019s a compelling urban legend anime that delivers tension and horror.\n\n8. Higurashi: When They Cry\n\nHigurashi: When They Cry (Image via Studio Deen)\n\nConsidered one of the most iconic horror anime, Higurashi: When They Cry explores stories about the frequent and mysterious deaths plaguing a rural village.\n\nIn particular, the series dissects the baffling events surrounding an annual festival honoring the local Shinto god Oyashiro. Urban legends suggest that breaking village traditions or leaving the community might invoke Oyashiro\u2019s curse, leading to horrific deaths.\n\nTold through multiple timelines caused by supernatural interference, Higurashi peels away the layers of darkness beneath the seemingly idyllic village. This urban legends anime skillfully blends horror and suspense with myths about gods and rituals.\n\n9. Paranoia Agent\n\nParanoia Agent (Image via Madhouse)\n\nAn eccentric introvert who designs a popular mascot becomes the first victim of Shonen Bat (Lil' Slugger), a mysterious assailant rumored to be a little boy with a crazed smile and a bent golden baseball bat.\n\nAs more random attacks are reported, detectives soon uncover the urban legend's unforeseen connections to societal fears and repressed guilt. Directed by acclaimed filmmaker Satoshi Kon, Paranoia Agent delves into trauma, repression, and hysteria through a layered, allegorical narrative.\n\nWhile not conventional horror, this psychologically thrilling urban legends anime series shares folkloric qualities about an enigmatic figure believed to reveal ugly truths about society through violence.\n\n10. Mermaid Forest\n\nMermaid Forest (Image via TMS Entertainment)\n\nAccording to ancient Japanese legend, consuming mermaid flesh grants immortality but only at a terrible cost. Mermaid Forest chronicles Yuta\u2019s centuries-long search to cure himself and others affected by the mermaid curse, which turns people into monstrous creatures if they fail to survive the transformation.\n\nSpanning multiple timelines, these short stories explore the paranormal afflictions of the accursed outcasts as they must make horrifying choices to survive.\n\nBoasting distinctive animation and character designs, haunting music, and a tragic tone reminiscent of old fairytales, this urban legends anime brings to life myths surrounding dangerous magic and eternal life.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe urban legends anime mentioned here have successfully mined Japan\u2019s rich heritage of ghost stories, paranormal mysteries, and demonic folklore to craft memorable series. Their riveting and often creepy plots based on urban legends make for compelling viewing, especially for horror fans.\n\nRelated Links:-\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThe small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning.\n\nMs Rassalle explained: \"The purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\" She continued: \u201cThese amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world but they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

The Municipality of North Perth has set aside 10 acres of serviced land on the west side of Listowel near Binning Street and Road 165.\n\nThe agricultural innovation centre has been discussed since 2020. The goal, say organizers is to build a permanent year-round showcase for Ontario\u2019s agriculture and food industries, with a focus on technology and opportunities that exist in the industry.\n\nThe potential cost ranges anywhere from $20 to $38 million. Organizers anticipate raising half the building costs from the private sector, and the other have from government grants.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the Ontario Agri-Food Discovery Centre will be welcoming visitors to the edge of Listowel by 2028.\n\nYou can learn more by visiting www.huronperthagsciencecentre.ca"

(WSVN) - A South Florida mother is demanding accountability after, she said, her 11-year-old son was attacked by a teacher while on a field trip.\n\nSpeaking with 7News on Thursday, Yasmine Fran\u00e7ois said the incident occurred while her son Kendrick, a sixth-grade student at McNicol Middle School in Hollywood, was on a field trip at the Museum of Discovery and Science in Fort Lauderdale on Dec. 20.\n\nFran\u00e7ois said she initially got a call that Kendrick had gotten into a fight.\n\nUpon the child\u2019s arrival at home, Fran\u00e7ois took away his phone and prepared to scale back his Christmas gifts.\n\nBut then a friend sent her a video showing the moments after the fight.\n\nThe video, provided by the mother, shows a woman identified by Kendrick as a teacher pulling him into a picnic bench, then jumping on top of him.\n\nAudio from the video captures what sounds like a slap. On top of all that, the woman seen in the clip yelled profanities at the child.\n\nFran\u00e7ois said she was stunned.\n\n\u201cHow do you handle a kid like that? Who does that?\u201d she said.\n\nBefore seeing the video, Fran\u00e7ois said she was skeptical of what had occurred.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You know what? It\u2019s Christmas, he knows he\u2019s in trouble, so he\u2019s probably \u2013 I didn\u2019t believe that. I said, \u2018No teacher would choke you, especially a lady, like no,'\u201d she said.\n\nFran\u00e7ois said her son got a three-day school suspension, adding that the school principal never reported the teacher\u2019s actions which, the concerned mother said, crossed the line.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a teacher, and this is how you address your student? That\u2019s the language? Is that the vocabulary you use to speak to a kid? Is that how you speak in the classroom?\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois.\n\nThe mother now wants the teacher to be held accountable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the mom that\u2019s gonna take sides with my son. Like, if you do something bad, you know, you do something bad. I\u2019ll most likely side with the school before I side with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m highly disappointed because I feel like I was misled. They told me what he did. They didn\u2019t tell me what they did to him.\u201d\n\nBroward County Schools did not immediately respond to 7News\u2019 request for comment, as they are on winter break.\n\nThe mother hopes that once school resumes, she can sit down and have a conversation with school officials about what occurred.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

            "article_content": "OpenAI says its corporate structure must evolve to advance its mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2014 AI that can complete most tasks humans can \u2014 benefits all humanity.\n\nThe company currently has a for-profit org controlled by a nonprofit, with a \u201ccapped profit\u201d share for investors and employees. But in a blog post published Friday, the company says it plans to begin transitioning its existing for-profit into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), with ordinary shares of stock and the OpenAI mission as its public benefit interest.\n\nThose details had been reported elsewhere. In December, The New York Times revealed that OpenAI was in discussions to pay its nonprofit billions of dollars for it to cede control. However, it\u2019s the first time OpenAI has laid out its proposal in a public memo.\n\n\u201cAs we enter 2025, we will have to become more than a lab and a startup \u2014 we have to become an enduring company,\u201d OpenAI wrote in its post. \u201cThe world is moving to build out a new infrastructure of energy, land use, chips, data centers, data, AI models, and AI systems for the 21st century economy. We seek to evolve in order to take the next step in our mission.\u201d\n\nOpenAI says establishing the PBC would enable it to \u201cbalance shareholder interests, stakeholder interests, and a public benefit interest\u201d in its decision-making while allowing it to \u201craise the necessary capital with conventional terms.\u201d It would also create one of the best-resourced nonprofits in history, OpenAI claims; OpenAI\u2019s existing nonprofit would receive shares in the PBC \u201cat a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a nonprofit and a for-profit today, and we will continue to have both,\u201d OpenAI wrote. \u201cOur current structure does not allow the board to directly consider the interests of those who would finance the mission and does not enable the nonprofit to easily do more than control the for-profit. The PBC will run and control OpenAI\u2019s operations and business, while the nonprofit will hire a leadership team and staff to pursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science.\u201d\n\nOpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. But as its experiments became increasingly capital-intensive, it created its current structure, taking on outside investments from VCs and companies, including Microsoft.\n\nIn October, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation, bringing its total raised to $17.9 billion. The company still expects to lose money this year, however \u2014 $5 billion, according to CNBC \u2014 and the terms of its latest funding round require that it complete a for-profit transition within two years.\n\nThe plan faces hurdles.\n\nOne of OpenAI\u2019s co-founders, billionaire Elon Musk, has filed for an injunction to halt the company\u2019s transition to a for-profit, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its original philanthropic mission. Musk has also alleged that OpenAI has deprived his own AI company, xAI, of capital by extracting promises from investors not to fund it.\n\nOpenAI has called Musk\u2019s complaints \u201cbaseless\u201d and simply a case of sour grapes.\n\nFacebook\u2019s parent company and AI rival, Meta, is also supporting efforts to block OpenAI\u2019s conversion. In December, Meta sent a letter to California attorney general Rob Bonta, arguing that allowing the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, nonprofit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government,\u201d Meta wrote in the letter.\n\nOpenAI competitors like xAI and Anthropic are structured as PBCs but lack a nonprofit component.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s structure as it exists today is what ultimately led to the abrupt ousting of CEO Sam Altman last November, which greatly displeased investors \u2014 in particular Microsoft. It also gives OpenAI\u2019s board the power to determine exactly when OpenAI has achieved AGI, and exempts this AGI from the licensing agreements the startup has in place with customers.\n\nOne of those customers is Microsoft \u2014 and Microsoft and OpenAI are said to have a specific, internal financial definition of AGI. According to The Information, the two companies signed an agreement last year stating OpenAI has only achieved AGI when it develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profits.\n\nOpenAI continues to deal with an outflow of high-level talent due in part to concerns that the company is prioritizing commercial products at the expense of safety. One former employee, Carroll Wainwright, who researched aligning AI systems with safety policies, wrote in a post on X this fall that OpenAI \u201cwas structured as a nonprofit [but] acted like a for-profit\u201d and \u201cshould not [be trusted] when it promises to do the right thing later.\u201d\n\nIn a series of posts on X, Miles Brundage, a longtime policy researcher who left OpenAI in October, said that he has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about OpenAI\u2019s transition plan as outlined.\n\n\u201cFirst, there is surprisingly little discussion of actual governance details, despite this arguably being the key issue,\u201d Brundage wrote. \u201cSecond, a well-capitalized nonprofit on the side is no substitute for PBC product decisions \u2026 being aligned to the original nonprofit\u2019s mission \u2026 Third, while there is a ton of potential for a well-capitalized nonprofit to drive \u2018charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science,\u2019 that is a very narrow scope relative to the original OpenAI mission. What about advancing safety and good policy?\u201d\n\nBrundage said that he worries about OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit becoming a \u201cside thing\u201d that gives license to the PBC to operate as a \u201cnormal company\u201d without addressing potentially problematic areas.\n\n\u201cBesides board details, what other guardrails are being put in place \u2026 to ensure that the nonprofit\u2019s existence doesn\u2019t (seem to) let the PBC off too easy?\u201d he wrote. \u201c[A]s OpenAI knows (in part from work I coauthored there), competition also begets corner-cutting. What are the PBC and nonprofit going to do about this?\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter! Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday."

            "article_content": "The thing you need to know about OpenAI, according to OpenAI, is that its only goal is to solve \u201cthe most important challenge of our time\u201d in order to benefit all of humanity and the whole world.\n\nThat will continue to be the case, the organization said in an announcement on Friday, even as it restructures itself from a corporation controlled by a nonprofit to a stand-alone corporation that happens to throw a lot of money at an affiliated nonprofit.\n\nHow does this restructuring help OpenAI fulfill its mission of benefiting all humans and things non-human? Well, it\u2019s simple. OpenAI\u2019s \u201ccurrent structure does not allow the Board to directly consider the interests of those who would finance the mission.\u201d Under the new structure, OpenAI\u2019s leadership will finally be able to raise more money and pay attention to the needs of the billionaires and trillion-dollar tech firms that invest in it. Voila, everyone benefits.\n\nNot mentioned in the press release is the fact that a year ago the non-profit board that oversaw OpenAI unsuccessfully tried to give CEO Sam Altman the boot for \u201coutright lying\u201d in ways that, according to former board member Helen Toner, made it difficult for the board to ensure that the company\u2019s \u201cpublic good mission was primary, was coming first\u2014over profits, investor interests, and other things,\u201d\n\nWith its new structure, OpenAI wants to maintain at least a facade of altruism. The for-profit company will be incorporated as a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation, which means that its board can consider how the company\u2019s actions impact stakeholders like employees and customers in addition to its fiduciary responsibility to shareholders (Corporate law experts have pointed out that normal corporations are also perfectly free to do this).\n\nOther publicly traded Delaware Public Benefit Corporations include Laureate Education, which operates a string of for-profit universities around the world, including one that was accused multiple times of misleading students about the cost of its degree programs (Laureate sold Walden University prior to the university settling a class action lawsuit earlier this year for $28.5 million). Another is Lemonade Inc., an insurance company that once advertised, and quickly apologized for, an AI feature it claimed could detect fraudulent customers by analyzing their faces.\n\nMixed in with all the effective accelerationist saviorism in OpenAI\u2019s announcement, is the clear message that the new company plans to raise a ton more money to further its drive toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). According to reporting from The Information, OpenAI and Microsoft have defined AGI as systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profits. You know, the hallmark of intelligence.\n\nWhat will become of the nonprofit that currently oversees the company is less clear, although it certainly won\u2019t be pinching pennies. It wasn\u2019t a very traditional nonprofit to begin with, having quickly churned through $137 million in donated cash from Elon Musk and other tech moguls in addition to more than $100 million in free computing from Google, Microsoft, and others in order to create generative AI systems that now benefit for-profit corporations.\n\nAfter the corporate transition is complete, the nonprofit won\u2019t have any oversight duties at OpenAI but it will receive shares in the new for-profit company and be \u201cone of the best-resourced non-profits in history,\u201d according to OpenAI\u2019s press release. That will allow it to \u201cpursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, it won\u2019t be long before we all start benefitting from its charity."

            "source": "TechRepublic",
            "article_content": "Payments trends in 2024 and beyond are largely impacted by technology and the state of the economy. We\u2019re seeing a decline in discretionary spending, and an increase in the number of ways consumers like to make payments. Plus, AI and biometrics are also impacting payment security and fraud prevention.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll walk you through a few digital payment trends\u200b to watch as you prepare your business for the future of payment processing.\n\n1. Diversified payment methods\n\nOne of the more well-known global payment trends\u200b is payment method diversity. There are so many ways to make payments these days. I can choose cash, card, mobile app, QR code, tap to pay, buy now and pay later (BNPL), or even cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to a survey by Square, preferences are pretty widespread across the board. While 58% of consumers still use cash, 57% prefer mobile wallets, and 53% use QR code payments. Another 44% use traditional credit and debit cards, 44% use touchless card payments, and 43% use BNPL.\n\nBNPL is particularly notable, as it\u2019s now being adopted in more industry verticals than before. Groceries, for example, may be available for purchase via BNPL. In fact, BNPL grocery purchases increased by 40% between 2023 and 2024, according to Deloitte. This is a direct response to the current economic and political climate, which is causing a decrease in discretionary spending.\n\nThe list of payment options will only continue to grow as the economy moves further away from cash and check and towards innovative payment methods like NFC or biometric payments. This also means considering options like subscriptions, cryptocurrency, saved payments, bill splitting, peer-to-peer (P2P), and gift cards.\n\nHere\u2019s another interesting stat from Deloitte: 70% of consumers say their store choice is highly influenced by whether or not the store offers their preferred payment method. It is therefore important for businesses to keep up.\n\nRelated: Best crypto payment gateways\n\nCash vs cashless\n\nToday\u2019s consumers like convenience and options. I remember when it was just a cash or credit world\u2014now, consumers can choose to pay for their purchases in many ways.\n\nHowever, according to data from Square, about 58% of shoppers still prefer cash. In fact, some trends are even indicating a move back to cash and away from digitization.\n\nSo, there\u2019s really no clear winner in a cash vs. cashless debate. The real answer for businesses is to create ways to allow customers to pay with or without cash.\n\nRelated: What is a cashless society? From speculation to near-reality\n\nMobile payments and digital wallets\n\nMobile payments and digital wallets\u2014like Apple Pay and Google Pay\u2014are another payment trend that has been around for a while but continues to impact businesses everywhere, especially as this technology evolves.\n\nPer Deloitte, 57% of consumers prefer to pay with mobile wallet apps. Digital wallets actually made up 37% of transaction value for e-commerce payments and 15% of POS payments in North America in 2023.\n\nContactless pay can also fall under the category of mobile payments. Mobile payments involve the use of NFC technology so a customer can hold up their phone or smartwatch to the reader rather than having to insert a chip or swipe a card. The contactless payment market is also expected to see major growth\u2014at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 113% through 2029, according to Juniper Research.\n\nRelated: Top mobile payment methods\n\nCrypto payments\n\nCryptocurrency payments skyrocketed in popularity when they were first introduced. The trend did lose some steam partly due to regulatory challenges, currency volatility, susceptibility to fraud, and low confidence in the currency\u2019s viability over the long term, perhaps thanks to the FTX scandal and collapse.\n\nWith this doubt, the crypto payments market is only forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 17% through 2029.\n\nHowever, since Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, crypto and bitcoin have seen a resurgence of popularity in the United States.\n\n2. Biometrics features\n\nBiometric payments are experiencing a surge in growth, with forecasts to grow at a CAGR of 113.6% from 2024 through 2028, per Juniper Research. Some forecasts even say it will be the norm within the next decade. These payments incorporate biometric technology\u2014usually in the form of fingerprint or facial recognition\u2014to improve both data privacy and transaction convenience.\n\nSecurity is a top concern for businesses, both themselves and their customers. This is especially important when it comes to payments\u2014there\u2019s lots of sensitive information going around, so businesses are always looking for ways to tighten things up from a security perspective. Biometric payments are another layer of security that can help accomplish this.\n\nNot only does biometric authentication help boost security, but it also makes login and connection more efficient. I can\u2019t tell you how many passwords I have to remember\u2014if I can use my fingerprint or my face to authenticate something instead, that\u2019s one less password I have to keep track of. And remember, shoppers love efficiency and convenience.\n\n3. AI to facilitate and fight fraud\n\nFraud is always a threat to businesses and consumers. According to Avidchange\u2019s B2B Payment Security report, more than three-quarters of businesses have experienced payment fraud in the past year alone.\n\nSpeaking of security, AI is another payment trend to watch. And this can work in businesses\u2019 favor or, in a worst-case scenario, fraudsters\u2019 favor. Globalpayments reports that as many as 43% of businesses have plans to employ AI technology to help with fraud detection.\n\nWhile AI is an amazing tool to detect fraudulent transactions and add a layer of security, it also makes the work of a hacker much more accessible.\n\nRather than manually decoding payment information, hackers can tap into AI technology to make it easier to accomplish their tasks. In fact, Deloitte actually predicts that AI could enable losses to fraud of up to $40 billion by 2027. So, it\u2019s important to use payment technology that integrates the latest and most advanced security features.\n\n4. Instant payments\n\nWhile consumers love the convenience of being able to pay with anything other than cash, this has also added to delays when it comes to being able to access said cash.\n\nDigital payments often come with a waiting period\u2014for example, if I make a purchase with my credit card at a store, it might take a day or two for the charge to show up. Likewise, when I transfer money from PayPal or Venmo to my account, I usually have to wait a few days to receive the funds in my bank account.\n\nThese delays don\u2019t gel with our instant gratification society. So, payment technology is adapting to instant payments. For example, if I want to receive my PayPal or Venmo funds right away, I can actually pay a fee for an instant transfer.\n\nInstant payments are actually expected to make up 22% of transactions by 2028, per Capegemini\u2019s World Payments Report 2025. It\u2019s also believed that more instant payment availability will also facilitate more digital payment adoption by both businesses and consumers alike. JPMorgan reports about 80% of finance professionals believe faster payments will positively impact business.\n\nBut time will tell on this one\u2014only about 5% of global banks have advanced business technology, so there\u2019s still work to do.\n\n5. B2B is going digital\n\nB2B payments used to be largely check-based. But checks are quickly becoming antiquated in the payments industry. In fact, 80% of B2B transactions used to be paid by check\u2014that figure is now closer to one-third. And only about 5% of businesses are even prepared to make vendor and supplier payments by check.\n\nYou can see the decline in cash and check in B2B payment trends in the chart below. In 2019, they made up half of all B2B payments. Now, they account for less than one-third. Digital ACH transfers are making the most headway, but card and wire payments also experienced a slight increase."

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Enpass Individual Score Details \u201cEnpass Individual has affordable plans for mobile sync, but there are some trade-offs with its unique storage options.\u201d Pros Strong security via third-party cloud\n\nEasy access to logins and more\n\nUnlimited free desktop app\n\nLow prices for mobile sync\n\nUnlimited secure storage Cons No web app\n\nSharing is awkward\n\nEmail support\n\nTable of Contents Table of Contents Specs Tiers and pricing Design Features Support Privacy and security Is Enpass right for you?\n\nEnpass is a password manager that can store and sync logins to Google Drive, iCloud, or other cloud storage providers. That means you can choose which leading tech company you trust most to encrypt and secure your account passwords.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe best password managers go beyond auto-filling passwords on favorite websites. You can also organize and share logins, notes, and more with ease. I went hands-on with the free and paid version of Enpass to find out how well its cloud sync works and whether it\u2019s a good solution for your needs.\n\nSpecs\n\nEnpass Platforms Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android Devices Unlimited Support Email, Forums Free version? Yes\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nEnpass has a nice desktop app that you can use for free on Windows, macOS, and Linux computers. Android and iOS apps can only sync 25 logins for free, a good incentive to become a subscriber. Who has only 25 accounts?\n\nAn Enpass plan starts at just $10 annually and renews at $24. That\u2019s very affordable pricing that\u2019s equivalent to $1 initially, climbing to $2 per month after 12 months.\n\nEnpass Family provides accounts for up to six family members. The initial cost is $30, and the subscription renews at $48. That makes the family plan a good choice for families with three to six members.\n\nA unique one-time payment plan lets you buy a lifetime Enpass Individual license for $80. If you anticipate using Enpass for at least four years, the One-Time plan offers the best value. It\u2019s like year five and beyond are free.\n\nWhile it\u2019s rare, there are other password managers that accept a single payment. For example, StickyPassword is an offline password manager that syncs to your other devices over Wi-Fi.\n\nA paid Enpass subscription unlocks unlimited items on mobile devices, more organization features, and monitoring for password breaches.\n\nDesign\n\nI started with the free Windows app. Enpass setup was quick and simple. I created an individual account and verified my email address. Next, I was given several cloud sync options, including Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, and Box.\n\nThere are also options to save data locally and sync with other devices via Wi-Fi. I could also set up WebDAV or NextCloud servers to self-host. I chose Google Drive, authenticated, and chose a strong master password.\n\nI was guided to install the browser extension and authenticate. I checked the app and couldn\u2019t find a place to enter verify. After looking around for a bit, I went back to the browser and typed the code that I saw on screen even though there was no box to type into. That worked, and I was ready to start using Enpass in Microsoft Edge. Enpass also supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi.\n\nI also switched on Windows Hello authentication so I didn\u2019t have to type my long master password when Enpass timed out or when I restarted my computer. Settings are arranged in tabs so it was easy to find what I needed.\n\nFeatures\n\nEnpass autofill worked just like most other password managers. When I visited Netflix, my login appeared as soon as I selected the username or password field. Signing in only took two clicks of my mouse.\n\nIf I use Enpass as a launcher, choosing a website from the Windows app or browser extension, the page loads and I\u2019m automatically logged in, so I can access my favorite websites even faster.\n\nEnpass lets me attach files and photos to secure notes. Cross-platform syncing worked perfectly. I could see use the passwords from my Windows PC on my iPhone to autofill in Safari. I created a secure note and attached a photo from my iPhone gallery, and in seconds it appeared on my computer.\n\nWhile the 3GB secure storage limit of NordPass is generous, Enpass doesn\u2019t limit how much data I use. That\u2019s between me and my cloud provider.\n\nUnfortunately, the simplicity breaks down when you want to share a login, note, or other item with someone else. I had to use the Enpass app and navigate through menus to generate a key, giving it a name and a password. The name is for my reference, but the password is needed by the recipient to unlock shared items.\n\nNext, I find the item I want to share and provide an email address or copy a link to message to my friend or family member. The recipient must have the Enpass app installed to open the link. To make matters worse, Gmail didn\u2019t hyperlink the eight-line URL so they had to select copy and paste it into Enpass.\n\nKeeper and 1Password lead the way with simple yet robust sharing features that don\u2019t require everyone to have an account.\n\nSupport\n\nEnpass offers email support, which usually means you\u2019ll have to wait up to 24 hours for a reply. That\u2019s not as convenient as the 24/7 live chat option from competitor Keeper, but Enpass has a very thorough support center and online user guide to look up information.\n\nOn the evening of December 24, I sent an email and also filled in the contact form on the support page. I received replies from both very early on the 26th, taking about 31 hours. That\u2019s fast for email support during the holiday season.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nEnpass\u2019 privacy policy looks good. It collects the minimum user data needed to provide service and doesn\u2019t sell or share your email address with third-party advertisers.\n\nYour data is stored on your own devices or in your chosen cloud service. No logins are uploaded, and Enpass uses end-to-end AES-256 encryption based on your master password, so no one can access your accounts, even Enpass staff.\n\nEnpass security has been verified by Cure53, a well-known and trusted independent security lab.\n\nIs Enpass right for you?\n\nEnpass is a great option for free use on Windows, macOS, and Linux computers. However, you\u2019ll probably need to sync with mobile devices. In that case, there are better free password managers with full cross-platform syncing.\n\nI recommend Proton Pass, which is part of Proton Free, since it includes free password management, VPN, cloud storage, and more.\n\nThe best password managers make a strong effort to secure your data, but there have been notable issues. LastPass was hacked in 2022 and 1Password suffered a minor breach in 2023.\n\nWhere Enpass shines is the variety of storage options that let you choose where to your logins are saved. With a paid Enpass plan you can over local Wi-Fi, use your own server, or choose from a variety of popular cloud storage services. If you already trust Google, Microsoft, Apple, or others with most of your data, it might make sense to store logins there as well."

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

I\u2019ve been seeing this girl \u201cAngie\u201d for eight months now. She is everything to me. I fell in love with her right away, and she said she loved me first within the first month.\n\nBut now, I get yelled at for basically everything I say. Like today, I called her for the first time at 2:30 p.m. and she answered the phone saying, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask what she\u2019s up to and she says, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business\u201d and then goes, \u201cI\u2019m done talking now.\u201d This is a typical conversation for us.\n\nAnnie, I never cheated on this girl. I have always treated her well. Is it cheating if I just quit talking to her and start looking for someone else? The crappy part is that I don\u2019t want anyone else. But I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can put up with this. -- Should I Stay or Should I Go\n\nDear Should I Stay: Before you start looking for someone else, you need to tell Angie the relationship is over. Just because she isn\u2019t treating you well doesn\u2019t mean you should stoop to her level.\n\nAs for not wanting anyone else, you\u2019ll never know until you start looking. You\u2019d be amazed at what a clean break and a little bit of time can do.\n\nDear Annie: I will be inheriting a modest sum of money and want to gift some of it to my two married children. I also want to gift some money to my daughter\u2019s two young children to be used for future educational needs. My son and his wife don\u2019t have children and will likely not have any in the future. They lost beautiful twins born prematurely many years ago.\n\nI want to be fair and compassionate with the distribution of money. If I gift the same amount to my two children and a smaller amount to our two grandchildren, do you think my son will feel the distribution is unfair? I realize the inheritance is mine to do with as I please, but I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. We are all kind and level-headed people. -- Grandma in a Quandary\n\nDear Grandma: Your thoughtfulness and consideration for everyone\u2019s emotions show what a caring grandma you are.\n\nGifting the same amount to each child, plus additional funds earmarked for your grandkids' education, is a perfectly fair approach. But because your son and daughter-in-law experienced such a profound loss, it\u2019s wise to consider how this might affect them emotionally. If you want, you could contribute something unique to them as well -- a trip, for example -- to show extra consideration.\n\nSend your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.\n\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM\n\n"

            "date": "2h",
            "source": "TechRepublic",
            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Far-right activists clashed online with billionaire Elon Musk and other supporters of President-elect Donald Trump over the need for a skilled-worker immigration program that has long been a lifeblood for Silicon Valley \u2014 signifying a potential rift between Trump\u2019s core nationalist base and technology executives who have come to support him.\n\nThe fight that spilled into public view over the holiday week could preview a wedge within Trump\u2019s coalition over how to execute immigration policy, an issue that animated Trump\u2019s White House campaign.\n\nThe controversy spread across X after far-right activist Laura Loomer on Monday criticized Trump\u2019s choice to name Sriram Krishnan, a technology entrepreneur and investor who was born in India, as his senior policy adviser on artificial intelligence. She pointed to Krishnan\u2019s previous support for removing some caps on green cards and easing the ability of skilled foreign workers to come to the United States. The policy is \u201cin direct opposition\u201d to Trump\u2019s agenda, Loomer wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe critique sparked a broader debate about immigration in the tech industry, which relies heavily on a visa program that allows foreigners with technical skills to work in the United States for up to six years under H-1B nonimmigrant status.\n\nIt ran headlong into tension with some of Trump\u2019s closest advisers, notably Tesla and SpaceX CEO Musk; David Sacks, who will be the president-elect\u2019s AI and crypto czar; and Vivek Ramaswamy, who will co-lead a commission to cut government spending.\n\nRamaswamy argued American culture doesn\u2019t produce enough skilled workers to fuel cutting-edge companies. \u201c\u2018Normalcy\u2019 doesn\u2019t cut it in a hyper-competitive global market for technical talent,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cAnd if we pretend like it does, we\u2019ll have our asses handed to us by China.\u201d\n\nThe online fight sparked a slew of racist posts from Loomer and allegations of censorship. She said her X account lost its verified status and premium subscribers because Musk, who owns the platform, was retaliating against her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA screenshot purporting to show that Loomer\u2019s X account had been flagged for violating rules against \u201cposting other people\u2019s private information\u201d bounced around the social network. The Washington Post could not independently verify the authenticity of the post.\n\n\u201cSo much for free speech,\u201d she said in an X post on Friday. \u201cQuite totalitarian if you ask me.\u201d\n\nNotable Republicans, including former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley, championed Loomer\u2019s position. \u201cIf the tech industry needs workers, invest in our education system,\u201d Haley said in a post on X on Friday. \u201cInvest in our American workforce. We must invest in Americans first before looking elsewhere.\u201d\n\nTech executives, including Musk, have said they would prefer to hire American workers because obtaining visas for foreign workers can be time-consuming and costly. But Musk, who once held an H-1B visa and has relied on the program to employ thousands of Tesla employees, said recruiting foreign workers is a crucial way technology companies obtain the best engineering talent to compete globally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,\u201d Musk wrote on X on Christmas. \u201cIf you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be.\u201d\n\nThe online feud reflects the challenges that Trump will have holding together the delicate political coalition that delivered him the White House, which included unprecedented levels of financial support from Musk and other Silicon Valley billionaires.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of future conflicts,\u201d said Samuel Hammond, a senior economist at the Foundation for American Innovation. \u201cThis is like the pregame.\u201d\n\nKrishnan declined to comment. Loomer and a representative for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Trump traveled with Loomer during the campaign, but amid criticism of her previous statements, he said in September he doesn\u2019t \u201ccontrol\u201d her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has sought to position himself as a champion for legal immigration, even though he slashed pathways for immigrants during his first term. Trump has offered few specifics about how he will address skilled immigration in the tech industry during his second term.\n\nOn a June episode of the \u201cAll In\u201d podcast, which is co-hosted by Sacks, Trump said he would automatically give a green card to every international student with a college diploma.\n\n\u201cIf you graduate or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nAhead of the first Trump administration, many tech CEOs sought to build bridges with the president-elect during the transition with a meeting at his New York Trump Tower. But those delicate relationships broke down when Trump almost immediately rolled out what critics and federal judges have branded a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d which prohibited U.S. entry by the citizens of several majority-Muslim countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe episode amounted to a \u201cshock wave\u201d in the industry, where many founders and workers are immigrants, Hammond said.\n\n\u201cImmigration is an economically important issue for tech, but also in many cases a personal one,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all understand the inefficiencies and the bureaucracy around the U.S. immigration system and the Kafkaesque nightmares it can throw you in.\u201d\n\nBut this time, the tech industry is far more directly intertwined in Trump\u2019s transition. Self-described \u201cfirst buddy\u201d Musk has spent much of the time since Election Day by the president-elect\u2019s side, and Trump has tapped many Silicon Valley investors and executives to serve in prominent roles within his administration.\n\nAs Silicon Valley companies compete to create artificial intelligence products, the need for foreign-born talent has intensified. Twenty-eight of the top 43 AI companies in the United States were co-founded by immigrants, and 70 percent of full-time graduate students in AI-related fields are international students, according to a 2023 analysis from the National Foundation for American Policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump previews a hard-line immigration policy including militarized mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, many in the tech industry are pushing him to expand legal immigration for highly skilled workers. Some argue the shift is necessary for the United States to remain competitive with China.\n\nSkilled immigration emerged as one of the top flash points between Trump and Silicon Valley during his first presidency. Although Trump at times acknowledged the need for American companies to recruit top talent, his administration limited the H-1B program. Stephen Miller, who helped craft some immigration policies during the first Trump administration, is returning to the White House as Trump\u2019s deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser.\n\nThe online debate reverberated among Washington lawmakers, who have long pursued ways to improve the H-1B program. Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, defended Krishnan and said he supported reforming the H-1B program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe should celebrate that immigrants like Elon Musk, Jensen Huang and Sriram Krishnan choose to come to the United States,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cThis has fueled our economic and technology preeminence. I am glad Sriram is being appointed.\u201d\n\nThe restrictions of H-1B visas during Trump\u2019s first term faced fierce opposition from major tech companies. During the pandemic, Trump temporarily froze H-1B visas in a move the administration said would help Americans experiencing job loss. That same year, the Trump administration also introduced new rules tightening eligibility for H-1B visas and requiring companies to offer higher salaries to people on the visas. A federal judge later rejected some of the rules, including the salary provision.\n\nDuring President Joe Biden\u2019s final weeks in office, his administration has introduced rules to \u201cmodernize\u201d the H-1B program by making it easier for international students to obtain the visas and improving the efficiency of the application process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese reforms target systematic misuse by IT consulting firms while acknowledging the program\u2019s demonstrated net positive impact on U.S. technological competitiveness,\u201d said Divyansh Kaushik, a vice president at Beacon Global Strategies.\n\nTechnology companies are particularly reliant on H-1B visas \u2014 which are capped at 85,000 new visas annually \u2014 to help recruit talent. Amazon, with 3,871 new H-1B employees, had the most approved new petitions in 2024, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan organization National Foundation for American Policy. Google had 1,058 approved applications, and Tesla had 742, the data showed. (The Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.)\n\nRamaswamy said in an X post on Thursday that the reason technology companies hire foreign-born engineers is because \u201cAmerican culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long,\u201d drawing criticism from notable pro-Trump personalities.\n\nBrenden Dilley, a pro-Trump podcaster, shot back at Ramaswamy\u2019s post. \u201cI always love when these tech bros flat out tell you that they have zero understanding of American culture and then have the gall to tell you that YOU are the problem with America,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLoomer, who has 1.4 million followers on X, unleashed a slew of racist posts falsely describing Indians as \u201cthird world invaders\u201d with low IQs, and calling the clash a \u201ccivil war\u201d between Trump\u2019s far-right base and the \u201ctech bros\u201d that have come to support his upcoming administration.\n\nShe also sparred with Musk over his support of the H-1B program, questioning the skills of Indian programmers at X because of glitches during a May live event on the site kicking off Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cLoomer is trolling for attention. Ignore.\u201d Musk said on X.\n\nLoomer said she hopes the feud with Silicon Valley changes Trump\u2019s views.\n\n\u201cLooking forward to the inevitable divorce between President Trump and Big Tech,\u201d she said on X. \u201cLet\u2019s pray this fake Big Tech \u2018love fest\u2019 with Trump ends sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Dwoskin contributed to this report."

Evolving workloads could benefit competitors.\n\nCompanies like Groq, Positron, and SambaNova focus on inference to challenge Nvidia's market hold.\n\nIn 2025, the tides may turn for companies hoping to compete with the $3 trillion gorilla in AI computing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia holds an estimated 90% of the market share for AI computing. Still, as the use of AI grows, workloads are expected to change, and this evolution may give companies with competitive hardware an opening.\n\nIn 2024, the majority of AI compute spend shifted to inference, Thomas Sohmers, CEO of chip startup Positron AI, told BI. This will \"continue to grow on what looks like an exponential curve,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn AI, inference is the computation needed to produce the response to a user's query or request. The computing required to teach the model the knowledge needed to answer is called \"training.\" Creating OpenAI's image generation platform Sora, for example, represents training. Each user who instructs it to create an image represents an inference workload.\n\nOpenAI's other models have Sohmers and others excited about the growth in computing needs in 2025.\n\nOpenAI's o1 and o3, Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and a handful of other AI models use more compute-intensive strategies to improve results after training. These strategies are often called inference-time computing, chain-of-thought, chain-of-reasoning, or reasoning models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimply put, if the models think more before they answer, the responses are better. That thinking comes at a cost of time and money.\n\nThe startups vying for some of Nvidia's market share are attempting to optimize one or both.\n\nNvidia already benefits from these innovations, CEO Jensen Huang said on the company's November earnings call. Huang's wannabe competitors are betting that in 2025, new post-training strategies for AI will benefit all purveyors of inference chips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to three challengers about their hopes and expectations for 2025. Here are their New Year's resolutions.\n\nWhat's one thing within your control that could make 2025 a big year for alternative chips?\n\nMark Heaps is the chief technology evangelist for Nvidia challenger Groq. Groq\n\nMark Heaps, chief technology evangelist, Groq:\n\n\"Execution, execution, execution. Right now, everybody at Groq has decided not to take a holiday break this year. Everyone is executing and building the systems. We are all making sure that we deliver to the opportunity that we've got because that is in our control.\n\nI tell everyone our funnel right now is carbonated and bubbling over. It's unbelievable, the amount of customer interest. We have to build more systems, and we have to stand up those systems so we can serve the demand that we've got. We want to serve all those customers. We want to increase rate limits for everybody.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO, SambaNova Systems:\n\n\"For SambaNova, the most critical factor is executing on the shift from training to inference. The industry is moving rapidly toward real-time applications, and inference workloads are becoming the lion's share of AI demand. Our focus is on ensuring our technology enables enterprises to scale efficiently and sustainably.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nThomas Sohmers, CEO, Positron:\n\n\"My belief is if we can actually deploy enough compute \u2014 which thankfully I think we can from a supply chain perspective \u2014 by deploying significantly more inference-specific compute, we're going to be able to grow the adoption rate of 'chain of thoughts' and other inference-additional compute.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's one thing you're hoping for that's not in your control for 2025?\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO and cofounder of SambaNova Systems. SambaNova Systems\n\nHeaps:\n\n\"It's about customers recognizing that there are novel advancements against incumbent technologies. There's a lot of folks that have told us, 'We like what you have, but to use the old adage and rephrase it: No one ever got fired for buying from \u2014 insert incumbent.'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we know that it's starting to boil up. People are realizing it's hard for them to get chips from the incumbent, and it's also not as performant as Groq is. So my wish would be that people are willing to take that chance and actually look to some of these new technologies.\"\n\nLiang:\n\n\"If I had a magic wand, I'd address the power challenges around deploying AI. Today, most of the market is stuck using power-hungry hardware that wasn't designed for inference at scale. The result is an unsustainable approach \u2014 economically and environmentally.\n\nAt SambaNova, we've proven there's a better way. Our architecture consumes 10 times less power, making it possible for enterprises to deploy AI systems that meet their goals without blowing past their power budgets or carbon targets. I'd like to see the market move faster toward adopting technologies that prioritize efficiency and sustainability \u2014 because that's how we ensure AI can scale globally without overwhelming the infrastructure that supports it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSohmers:\n\n\"I would like people to actually adopt these chain of thought capabilities at the fastest rate possible. I think that is a huge shift \u2014 from a capabilities perspective. You have 8 billion parameter models surpassing 70 billion parameter models. So I'm trying to do everything I can to make that happen.\"\n\nWhat's your New Year's resolution?\n\nPositron AI executives. From left to right: Edward Kmett, Thomas Sohmers, Adam Huson, and Greg Davis. Positron AI\n\nHeaps:\n\n\"In the last six months, I've gone to a number of hackathons, and I've met developers. It's deeply inspiring. So my New Year's resolution is to try to amplify the signal of the good that people are doing with AI.\"\n\nLiang:\n\n\"Making time for music. Playing guitar is something I've always loved, and I would love to get back into it. Music has this incredible way of clearing the mind and sparking creativity, which I find invaluable as we work to bring SambaNova's AI to new corners of the globe.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSohmers:\n\nI want to do as much to encourage the usage of these new tools to help, you know, my mom. Part of the reason I got into technology was because I wanted to see these tools lift up people to be able to do more with their time \u2014 to learn everything that they want beyond whatever job they're in. I think that bringing the cost down of these things will enable that proliferation.\n\nI also personally want to see and try to use more of these things outside of my just work context because I've been obsessively using the o1 Pro model for the past few weeks, and it's been amazing for my personal work. But when I gave access to my mom what she would do with it was pretty interesting \u2014 those sort of normal, everyday person tasks for these things where it truly is being an assistant.\""

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "The expert said the prospect of an AI more intelligent than humans is a 'very scary thought'\n\nBritish-Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said we need to be \"very careful\" and \"very thoughtful\" about the development of artificial intelligence (AI) which he says is a \"potentially very dangerous technology\". Professor Hinton, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics this year, said the pace of change in the area of AI is \"much faster\" than he expected and there has not been enough time to complete the research he believes is required. While his work has laid the foundations for machine learning, technology that allows computers to mimic human intelligence, his recent efforts have centred on advocating for safer AI. Last year he made headlines after resigning from his job at Google, citing concerns \"bad actors\" would use the technology to harm others. Google said at the time: \u201cAs one of the first companies to publish AI Principles, we remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We\u2019re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\u201d\n\nArtificial intelligence captures Sun's varying atmospheric conditions\n\nReflecting on where he thought the development of AI would have reached when he first started this work, Prof Hinton told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I didn't think it would be where we would be now. I thought at some point in the future we would get here. \"Because the situation we're in now is that most of the experts in the field think that sometime, within probably the next 20 years, we're going to develop AIs that are smarter than people. \"And that's a very scary thought.\" He added: \"I like to think of it as, imagine yourself and a three-year-old - we'll be the three-year-olds, and they'll be the grown-ups.\" Prof Hinton said he thinks the impact AI could have on the world will be similar to the industrial revolution. \"In the industrial revolution, human strength ceased to be that relevant because machines were just stronger, and if you wanted to dig a ditch, you dug it with a machine. \"What we've got now is something that's replacing human intelligence, and just ordinary human intelligence will not be at the cutting edge anymore. It will be machines,\" he said.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
