            "article_content": "A dearth of blockbusters left room for some of the most interesting and mechanically polished video games in years. These are the best 10.\n\nMany gamers declared 2023 one of the best years for games, and I agree the quality standard was high. I think 2024 is the more interesting year. The best games of last year were wonderful, near-perfect reiterations of templates, formulas and intellectual properties. But big-budget game development is in a crisis of ballooning costs, shrinking profits and production cycles that can last up to a decade.\n\nWith fewer blockbusters to crowd out attention this year, smaller projects and independent studios found audiences seeking bold new ideas. \u201cHelldivers 2\u201d from Arrowhead sold 12 million copies in just three months, dispelling all notions that daily-engagement \u201clive service\u201d games like Fortnite and Call of Duty are the only path to multiplayer success. An upstart studio in China, Game Science, sold even more copies of its debut project, \u201cBlack Myth: Wukong,\u201d embraced by a Chinese market hungry for homegrown games.\n\nThe following 10 games offer different lessons for the industry, while also being the finest batch of games in years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. \u2018Dragon Age: The Veilguard\u2019\n\nEmerging out of a troubled development cycle and a decade of work, \u201cThe Veilguard\u201d is the most interesting blockbuster game of the year. It was once planned as a multiplayer game, and the bones of those abandoned ideas can protrude in nasty ways through its structure. It also removed many role-playing elements that endeared fans to the series. Yet BioWare, a once beloved but troubled studio, and game director Corrine Busche managed to reconstruct it all into a coherent, strong action experience with a gentle heart in love with its diverse, dynamic cast. Sometimes that diversity is handled in messy ways, like the game itself. But perfection is the enemy of greatness, particularly in representation, and \u201cThe Veilguard\u201d will be an important game for many people.\n\n9. \u2018Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth\u2019\n\nWhat if a grab bag of charming indie games (see \u201cUFO 50,\u201d below) took place in Hawaii, starred Japanese gangsters and had a much larger budget? The eighth title in the growing Like a Dragon series is filled with fully formed games within games. \u201cDodonko Island\u201d is basically Animal Crossing, except you\u2019re constructing homes and neighborhoods for adult Japanese people. This game also has two variations of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise and a Crazy Taxi tribute based on Uber Eats-style businesses, along with your usual poker and mah-jongg tables and fully functional arcade games like \u201cVirtua Fighter 5.\u201d It helps that it\u2019s still the best crime drama series of the medium, with its sweeping, thorough examinations of Japanese masculinity.\n\n8. \u2018Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom\u2019\n\nThe first official Zelda game starring the title princess is also the first title directed by a woman, Tomomi Sano. It was a slower year for Nintendo, yet its flagship series returned to classic form. An innovation in \u201cEchoes\u201d allows us to copy objects and monsters to navigate the world. The top-down perspective forced Nintendo to revisit and innovate on its classic dungeon templates. This may not be the most important game of the year, but it is an important evolution in the Zelda series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u2018UFO 50\u2019\n\n\u201cUFO 50\u201d \u2014 like others on this list a celebration of mechanics over anything \u2014 is an indie anthology series of 50 games that feel ripped out of the first decade of games. It reminded me of when my grandmother gave me a box of Nintendo games, a seemingly boundless box of adventure and fun. Most of these games are at least a few hours long, offering incredible value per dollar. This includes \u201cPorgy,\u201d a large exploration-based game like Metroid, and \u201cGrimstone,\u201d Final Fantasy-like game with Western elements.\n\n6. \u20181000xResist\u2019\n\nThis indie game by Sunset Visitor and written by Pinki Li and Conor Wylie is perfectly described by a Tumblr post: It \u201cboldly asks the question of what if a slightly awful teenage girl became the most important person in the world.\u201d It\u2019s a gentle meditation on cultural diaspora communities, told through a striking red, white and blue sci-fi art direction, probably the best of the year. If the horror game \u201cMouthwashing\u201d has the year\u2019s best-written narrative, \u201c1000xResist\u201d is a close second, told through a far more ambitious structure fusing visual novels with classic adventure game design.\n\n5. \u2018Astro Bot\u2019\n\nSony\u2019s emerging mascot character is another example of classic, perfected game design, this time in the platformer space. It\u2019s filled with references to other PlayStation brands, which can water down what makes this game special. But fluid level design and economical button assignments make this the best platformer since Mario\u2019s last outing in 2017. Through its numerous game references, \u201cAstro Bot\u201d is a stark reminder of amazing PlayStation games now ignored for big-budget projects, and its game design manifests why that greatness can still exist.\n\n4. \u2018Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\u2019\n\nThe middle sequel of a trilogy, \u201cRebirth\u201d is the grandest blockbuster game of the year, with more than 400 pieces of music, hundreds of hours of excellent voice acting and direction, and a full array of gaming experiences. It\u2019s also the best Square Enix fantasy game in two decades, since \u201cFinal Fantasy X\u201d on PlayStation 2. The denouement is watered down by trying to please too many audiences (veterans of the original game and newcomers) and spoils what is otherwise a perfect example of Final Fantasy\u2019s ability to leave us hopelessly in love.\n\n3. \u2018Balatro\u2019\n\nCreated by a single IT worker, \u201cBalatro\u201d is the purest video game of the year with a beautifully built system of rules that force us to rethink and reimagine every part of the standard 52-card deck. It shattered productivity for millions of players. Its hypnotic and snappy user interface makes this a joy to play; as developer LocalThunk told me, he loves \u201celegant, synergistic systems.\u201d This isn\u2019t just a digital version of a card game. Only a video game could mutate joker cards with superpowers the way \u201cBalatro\u201d does.\n\n2. \u2018Mouthwashing\u2019\n\nThis is not just the best-written game of the year, but of the past several years. The less you know about \u201cMouthwashing,\u201d the better, especially at a brisk three-hour playtime. Created by seven people (Wrong Organ), it resembles the great tragic American plays, a digital \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d that traps you in a maddening examination of unchecked ego, the cataclysm it can wreak, and the people who enable or ignore it. Its use of digital effects reinforces how this stage play could only be told as an interactive game. It is a repugnant and potent portrait of humanity\u2019s ugliest qualities and will stay in your memories for a very long time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u2018Metaphor: ReFantazio\u2019"

            "article_content": "In the face of piling controversy \u2014 and a second lawsuit concerning the welfare of children \u2014 Google has taken pains to downplay its relationship to the embattled AI chatbot startup Character.AI.\n\nAbout this time last year, though? Google was crowning Character.AI as Google Play's first-ever \"Best with AI\" app of the year.\n\n\"AI made a major splash in 2023 allowing people to harness the technology to build knowledge, improve expression, and much, much more,\" reads a Google post lauding the app. \"Enter Character.AI, an innovative new app that brings unique AI-powered characters to you, each with their own distinct personalities and perspectives.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A world of characters is now at your fingertips,\" the post adds. (OpenAI's ChatGPT is listed as the category's honorable mention.)\n\nEarlier today, two Texas families filed a lawsuit accusing the Character.AI platform of engaging in emotional and sexual abuse of their minor children, resulting in self-harm and physical violence. The complaint is the second in recent weeks concerning the welfare of child users of Character.AI \u2014 the first, filed in October in the state of Florida, argues that a 14-year-old's death by suicide was caused by his interactions with Character.AI \u2014 and argues that these disturbing incidents are the result of intentional design choices inherent to the platform's function.\n\nAccording to the suit, Character.AI and its cofounders, Noam Shazeer and Daniel de Freitas, aren't the only parties at fault. It also targets Google, a significant financial backer of Character.AI and the provider of its AI computing infrastructure, alleging that the tech giant knew about the Character.AI platform's dangers and facilitated its operations anyway in a ploy to farm valuable troves of user data without accountability.\n\nIn a statement to Futurism, Google rejected the lawsuit's characterization of its relationship with Character.AI, claiming that \"Google and Character.AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies, nor have we used them in our products.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"User safety is a top concern for us, which is why we've taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes,\" the company added.\n\nWhether Google intentionally used Character.AI as an unofficial AI testing facility remains to be proven in court.\n\nBut the two parties do clearly have deep ties: Shazeer and de Freitas, in fact, founded Character.AI in 2021 after departing Google over frustrations with corporate red tape. The Character.AI platform would make its way into consumers' hands in the fall of 2022, shortly before the AI race kicked off with the public release of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAnd in the heat of that industry-wide AI race \u2014 which caught Google on its back foot, as the New York Times reported at the time \u2014 Character.AI and Google seemingly held onto their close association. In May of 2023, for instance, Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian bragged onstage at a developer conference that Google was providing Character.AI with the pricey computing infrastructure needed to power its AI platform.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We provide Character with the world's most performant and cost-efficient infrastructure for training and serving the models,\" said Kurian at the time, calling Character.AI a \"partner.\" \"By combining its own AI capabilities with those of Google Cloud, consumers can create their own deeply personalized characters and interact with them.\"\n\nLater year, in early November, Reuters reported that Google was weighing a high-dollar investment into Character.AI. By the end of that same month, the platform had been crowned Google Play's first-ever \"Best with AI\" app.\n\n\"We've been increasingly impressed by what AI can do,\" Google added in its announcement of the award, \"and we know you'll be impressed, too.\"\n\nGoogle's interest in Character.AI continued into August of 2024, when the search behemoth agreed to pay Character.AI $2.7 billion for access to its AI model in the form of a one-time licensing fee. As part of that deal, Shazeer and de Freitas rejoined Google's AI division and took 30 other Character.AI employees with them, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiple Futurism reviews of Character.AI have revealed droves of alarming AI characters hosted by the platform, including chatbots explicitly dedicated to themes of suicide, pedophilia, pro-eating disorder content, and self-harm roleplay.\n\nThese disturbing chatbots were easy to find, accessible to Character.AI accounts listed as belonging to minors, and available for users to interact with well beyond Google's most recent August investment into the AI company \u2014 and, to that end, well after the platform's \"Best with AI\" crowning.\n\nCharacter.AI, for its part, has since removed a note about the Google Play award from its \"About\" page.\n\nMore on Character.AI and Google: Google-Backed AI Startup Tested Dangerous Chatbots on Children, Lawsuit Alleges"

            "article_content": "MIT Technology Review got to try out Astra in a closed-door live demo last week. It was a stunning experience, but there\u2019s a gulf between polished promo and live demo.\n\nAstra uses Gemini 2.0\u2019s built-in agent framework to answer questions and carry out tasks via text, speech, image, and video, calling up existing Google apps like Search, Maps, and Lens when it needs to. \u201cIt\u2019s merging together some of the most powerful information retrieval systems of our time,\u201d says Bibo Xu, product manager for Astra.\n\nGemini 2.0 and Astra are joined by Mariner, a new agent built on top of Gemini that can browse the web for you; Jules, a new Gemini-powered coding assistant; and Gemini for Games, an experimental assistant that you can chat to and ask for tips as you play video games.\n\n(And let\u2019s not forget that in the last week Google DeepMind also announced Veo, a new video generation model; Imagen 3, a new version of its image generation model; and Willow, a new kind of chip for quantum computers. Whew. Meanwhile, CEO Demis Hassabis was in Sweden yesterday receiving his Nobel Prize.)\n\nGoogle DeepMind claims that Gemini 2.0 is twice as fast as the previous version, Gemini 1.5, and outperforms it on a number of standard benchmarks, including MMLU-Pro, a large set of multiple-choice questions designed to test the abilities of large language models across a range of subjects, from math and physics to health, psychology, and philosophy.\n\nBut the margins between top-end models like Gemini 2.0 and those from rival labs like OpenAI and Anthropic are now slim. These days, advances in large language models are less about how good they are and more about what you can do with them.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where agents come in.\n\nHands on with Project Astra\n\nLast week I was taken through an unmarked door on an upper floor of a building in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross district into a room with strong secret-project vibes. The word \u201cASTRA\u201d was emblazoned in giant letters across one wall. Xu\u2019s dog, Charlie, the project\u2019s de facto mascot, roamed between desks where researchers and engineers were busy building a product that Google is betting its future on."

Mackey and his wife, Denise, have plans to rebuild a new, one-story bar on the land by 2026, The Enquirer previously reported. But that date is subject to change.\n\n\"It's mixed emotion for sure, but I've been so embarrassed by the old building for so long,\" Mackey, who opened the venue in 1978, told The Enquirer in March. \"It's going to be bittersweet because it's been great for almost 46 years we've been there.

In the 1930s, entrepreneur Buck Brady opened a nightclub on the land called the Primrose Club, which was supposedly taken over and run by the mob.\n\nThe nightclub was renamed the Latin Quarter and eventually shut down in the 1950s before reopening as the Hard Rock. After the Hard Rock closed in the 1970s, country singer and Kentucky native Bobby Mackey opened Bobby Mackey's Music World in 1978.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMackey told The Enquirer he knew the folklore surrounding the location but never paid any attention to the haunted rumors until he met Carl Lawson, an 18-year-old who lived up the street. Lawson was hired to be the establishment's caretaker.\n\nBobby Mackey's Music World on Sunday, Sept. 25, 2022. Toys and trinkets were left for the alleged ghosts that lurked in the \"room of faces.\" People have claimed to feel childlike spirits present in the room, but there is no real history of children being in or around the club.\n\nWhile tending to the property, Lawson, who lived above the nightclub until his death in 2012, started having paranormal experiences.\n\nHe is believed to have dug up the journal of a pregnant singer named Joanna, who allegedly killed herself via poison after her father murdered her lover and hung him in the dressing room. Lawson even participated in an exorcism performed by the \"Ghost Adventures\" crew, which was featured in the 2009 book \"Exorcism of Carl Lawson\" by Douglas Hensley.\n\nOver the years, the nightclub cultivated a fan base invested in both Mackey as a local country music legend and the ghost sightings that allegedly took place at his establishment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Look: Bobby Mackey's historic Kentucky nightclub gets demolished"

            "article_content": "EXCELSIOR SPRINGS, MO. \u2014 They say the Elms Hotel is haunted. In fact, the hotel leans into these stories with nightly paranormal tours that highlight the ghost stories.\n\nBut it also leans into its history. The story of the Elms begins with the discovery of healing mineral waters in Excelsior Springs, Missouri, in the late 1800s. People would come from all over to experience the dozen or so springs in town, particularly Siloam Spring, on the grounds of the Elms Hotel. Sometimes, miraculous tales of healing followed.\n\nThe Elms Hotel, about 30 minutes to the northeast of Kansas City, literally sprang up with these tales. In 1888 the original Elms was built. It was destroyed in a fire, as was its successor in 1910. The current iteration has been around since 1912. It\u2019s now a full-service upscale Hyatt property.\n\nThose ensuing years have seen a lot of history. Harry S. Truman stayed at the hotel the night he was elected president. Al Capone was a regular guest. There\u2019s even an Al Capone Suite on the second floor. And you can tour the boardroom where his gambling parties used to happen and see the safe he hid contraband in.\n\nNaturally, with all that history, ghost stories spring up: Doors that close without warning, TVs that go on and off. There\u2019s the story of a dog that roams the hotel as well as the story of a gangster from Prohibition days who haunts the lap pool. The hotel was featured on an episode of \u201cGhost Hunters\u201d in 2013.\n\nYou can learn all about the hauntings on one of the hotel\u2019s nightly paranormal tours. A guide (thankfully equipped with a headset speaker) takes a group on a tour of all floors of the hotel. Our guide, Jay, recounted countless stories, sometimes of particular rooms. The thing that gets you is the scope and scale of them. There are so many, and according to Jay, that was just a small fraction. Thankfully, all the stories told were of harmless or even benevolent ghosts, except one. That\u2019s when the tour got a little spooky for me, but for the most part it\u2019s full of history and fun. The tours are $25; just sign up at the front desk.\n\nThe Elms has 152 guest rooms and suites and makes for a perfect girls getaway or couples weekend. Amenities include a 10,000-square-foot spa (more on that later), an indoor European lap pool, a fitness room, an outdoor pool with hot tubs and a walking trail. A cozy fireplace in the opulent, open lobby is a great place to have drinks with a friend.\n\nThose healing waters\n\nNow, because of some safety concerns and a number of other reasons, only a couple of those famous springs remain. One can be found in the basement at the Elms, its brown magnesium-rich waters bubbling up in the corner of the most gorgeous lap pool room you have seen.\n\nBut you can get a feel for the springs\u2019 history at the Hall of Waters in downtown Excelsior Springs. The art deco building began in the 1930s as a public works project to take advantage of the springs\u2019 reputation. It was both a bottling facility and a spa of sorts for the healing, medicinal mineral waters. There, in its gorgeous tiled hall is a bar. No, not used for wine or whiskey but for water. Will you take yours with iron, magnesium, calcium? Hot or cold?\n\nNow, the building is used for city works with offices and even a courtroom. You can tour it, and the museum there, which features remnants of an old bath house. There\u2019s also an empty competition-sized saltwater swimming pool and an empty polio pool in the lower levels. Some days, you can tour those.\n\nYou can learn more about the town at the Excelsior Springs Museum and Archives. Normally, I skip these small-town museums, but I found this one fascinating, mainly because it is housed in a building that was once the Clay County State Bank built in 1894. The magnificent gold ceiling is buttressed on each end by 100-year-old paintings, copies of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet\u2019s paintings \u201cThe Gleaners\u201d on the south wall and \u201cThe Angelus\u201d on the north wall. There are even the original teller windows and a giant vault in the back.\n\nAlso in downtown Excelsior Springs you will find a number of antique shops and boutiques as well as restaurants and bars. Catch a show at the Slightly Off Broadway Theatre (sobtheatre.org) and definitely grab a beer at Atlas Saloon Brewery (atlassaloon.com). The space, including the cash register and wood bar have been around since the late 1800s, but the beer is worth a stop on its own; get a flight to taste as many as you can.\n\nDining in the hotel\n\nJust as you enter the front doors at the Elms there is a cute bar to the right, Soterian, which serves coffee in the morning and wine in the evening. It has almost an upscale-soda-fountain vibe. To the left, is the hotel\u2019s signature restaurant, Three Owls, which is open for breakfast (buffet on weekends), lunch and dinner. It\u2019s a gorgeous space. I told my friend that aesthetically it may be my favorite restaurant ever. It has soaring ceilings, bright white walls with clever artwork, a fireplace and a sweeping staircase that leads to more seating. Its breakfast food (oh, my, that cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e French toast) is as thoughtfully prepared as its short ribs. But it\u2019s hard to pass up the perfectly cooked steak. On the second floor, there is a cozy bar called the Tavern. It sometimes has live music and serves small bites.\n\nThe Spa\n\nFor many couples and girlfriend groups, the draw here is the spa. Since \u201cspa\u201d is in the name of the hotel (The Elms Hotel & Spa), you know it\u2019s a priority there. Whether you are there for couples massages, a girls-day facial or a more elaborate service, like a thermal mineral mudwrap, the spa leans into the hotel\u2019s earlier days of healing and beautifying.\n\nIts 28,000-square-feet include at least 15 treatment rooms, a sanctuary for relaxing and the Grotto, a modern twist on a Roman bath, which you can enjoy with your spa appointment. The Grotto Experience includes: steam shower, hot tub, cold plunge shower, steam sauna, dry sauna, and a self-service aromatherapy bar. You can pay $75 for the Grotto experience, but opt for a treatment and it\u2019s included (for reference, my collagen facial, which was amazing, was $180).\n\nIf you go Getting there: Excelsior Springs is less than four hours' drive from downtown St. Louis.

            "article_content": "New research published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters suggests that the Moon's oldest and largest impact crater, the South Pole-Aitken Basin, may be more circular than previously believed. For many years, scientists thought the basin had an elongated, elliptical shape. However, a team of scientists from the University of Maryland presented the results of a new analysis indicating that the collision which formed the basin occurred at a more vertical angle, resulting in a rounder shape.\n\nThe South Pole-Aitken Basin is considered the largest and oldest known impact structure on the Moon, with dimensions of 2,400 by 2,050 kilometers and a depth reaching 8 kilometers. It is located on the far side of the Moon and was first photographed by the Soviet spacecraft Luna 3 in 1959, and later by NASA's Clementine spacecraft in 1996. Its age is estimated to be more than 4 billion years, and many other impacts have obscured its original appearance.\n\n\"It's challenging to study the South Pole-Aitken Basin holistically due to its sheer enormousness, which is why scientists are still trying to learn its shape and size,\" said Assistant research scientist Hannes Bernhardt, who led the study. The team re-examined the basin and determined it has a more rounded shape than previously thought, as reported by Space.com.\n\nThe researchers reached this conclusion by studying data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which provided insights into the distribution of materials resulting from the impact. They used the data to find and analyze more than 200 mountain-shaped formations scattered around the basin. The shape of these formations and their distances from one another signify a more rounded crater that would be created from a vertical impact.\n\n\"The rounded shape implies that the debris from the impact are distributed around the point of impact more evenly than was originally assumed,\" the researchers stated. According to Bernhardt, this means \"Artemis astronauts or robots in the South Pole region may be able to closely study rocks from deep within the Moon's mantle or crust\u2014materials that are typically impossible for us to access.\" Bernhardt is cited by Space.com.\n\nThis new understanding challenges previous theories. For many years, it was believed that the South Pole-Aitken Basin had an oval or elliptical shape. Based on this, studies established that the crater was formed by an object striking the Moon at a shallow angle, with scientists comparing the event to a stone skipping on water. The prevailing theory suggested that the collision resulted in relatively few fragments being scattered around the South Pole of the Moon.\n\nThe new findings suggest that the impact was more vertical, \"possibly similar to dropping a rock straight down onto the ground,\" Bernhardt said. \"Our results may play a key role in understanding the evolution of the Moon,\" he added.\n\nRecent data from the Indian spacecraft Chandrayaan-3 discovered minerals presumably related to mantle materials near the Moon's South Pole, which also agrees with the theory of a vertical impact, as reported by Gazeta.ru.\n\nNASA plans to send astronauts close to the Moon's south pole again as part of the Artemis missions. Artemis 2, the first mission of its kind since 1972, is set to bring astronauts to the lunar surface in April 2026, according to Space.com. The new findings may have significant implications for these missions, as astronauts or robots may be able to study materials from deep within the Moon's mantle or crust.\n\nPrevious research published in October in Nature Astronomy dated the South Pole-Aitken Basin to between 4.32 and 4.33 billion years old. In that study, researchers determined the basin's age by dating uranium and lead found inside the Northwest Africa 2995 lunar meteorite, discovered in Algeria in 2005, as reported by Space.com.

            "article_content": "With its profound portrayal of redemption and damnation, there's no doubt 'The Last Judgement' is one of the most stunning paintings in the world to behold.\n\nMeasuring 45 feet by 40 feet, it was painted onto the whole altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City by Italian artist Michelangelo between 1536 and 1541.\n\nThe masterpiece shows several semi naked male figures rising to Heaven or descending into Hell on the day of the Last Judgement.\n\nNow, nearly 500 years on, a researcher claims to have found a key biblical figure in the beautiful fresco, who until now was 'missing'.\n\nMary Magdalene, one of Jesus Christ's most dedicated followers, makes a subtle appearance in the painting, according to Italian art expert and author Sara Penco.\n\nAllegedly a witness to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection, Mary Magdalene is depicted with blonde hair, kissing Jesus Christ's cross, the expert says.\n\nSo, can you find her in 'The Last Judgement'?\n\nIt follows a recent study revealing that a woman in another one of his Sistine Chapel paintings, 'The Flood', was painted with symptoms of breast cancer.\n\n'The Last Judgement' shows several semi naked male figures rising to Heaven or descending into Hell on the day of the Last Judgement. Measuring about 45 feet by 40 feet, the beautiful fresco covers the whole altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City\n\nThe historical figure, allegedly a witness to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection, is depicted with blonde hair and kissing the cross - but can you spot her?\n\nIf you're struggling with your search, look carefully at the far right of the painting and you'll see a blonde woman wearing a yellow robe and kissing a cross.\n\nThat's Mary Magdalene, according to Ms Penco, who outlines the discovery in her new book, 'Mary Magdalene in Michelangelo\u2019s Judgement'.\n\n'I am firmly convinced that this is Mary Magdalene,' she told a media conference in Rome on Tuesday, as reported by The Telegraph.\n\n'The intimacy with the cross, the yellow dress and the blonde hair but also the whole context in which Michelangelo places this figure to underscore her importance.'\n\nMs Penco claims that the muscular, near-naked male holding the cross is Jesus Christ.\n\nIt's not, as previously assumed, Simon of Cyrene, the man who was made by the Romans to carry Jesus' cross on the way to his crucifixion.\n\nThat suggests there are two portrayals of Jesus in 'The Last Judgement' \u2013 one at the right with Mary Magdalene and one at the centre.\n\nThe one at the centre shows Christ surrounded by many prominent saints, with the glow of light around him and his mother, Mary the Virgin, close by.\n\nAllegedly a witness to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection, Mary Magdalene depicted with blonde hair, kissing Jesus Christ's cross\n\nMs Penco is not contesting the fact that the revered figure at the centre of 'The Last Judgement' is Jesus Christ. Instead, she thinks this is just one of two portrayals of Jesus in the painting\n\nAccording to Italian art restorer Sara Penco, Michelangelo's 'The Last Judgement' features not one but two depictions of Jesus Christ - 'Christ the judge' (left) and 'Christ the redeemer' (right, holding the cross next to Mary Magdalene)\n\nWho was Mary Magdalene? Mary Magdalene holds a special place in Christian tradition as a beloved disciple of Jesus Christ. She is remembered for her pivotal role in the Gospel narratives as a witness to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. According to the Gospels, she was healed by Jesus from possession by seven demons (Luke 8:2), marking the start of her conversion. Source: St Edmund's Catholic Academy Advertisement\n\nWhile their faces look different, they both have their right arm in a similar position and the same lightly-coloured locks of hair.\n\nThey're also both clean-shaven, deviating from traditional depictions of Jesus with a beard, which thought to be inspired by an ancient Greek statue of Apollo.\n\nAlthough it may seem odd to have the same figure twice in one painting, they're differentiated as 'Christ the judge' and 'Christ the redeemer', Ms Penco claims.\n\n'Michelangelo was an expert painter, he was very cultured, he was someone who knew the dynamics of the church very well, he knew the gospels and he could not have forgotten her,' she added.\n\n'The Last Judgement' is thought to contain around 300 figures, so even 500 years since it was finished there's still debate surrounding their identity.\n\nBut Professor Yvonne Dohna Schlobitten at Gregorian University in Rome agrees with Ms Penco's new interpretation.\n\n'With great intuition, Sara Penco has discovered something that defines the being of art,' she says in the book\u2019s forward.\n\n'We can clearly see how iconography and theology are linked in Penco\u2019s reasoning to form a vision.\n\nMichelangelo painted The Last Judgement between 1536 and 1541, taking over four years to complete\n\n'The Last Judgement': One of Michelangelo's greatest masterpieces 'The Last Judgement' is widely regarded as one of Michelangelo\u2019s greatest masterpieces. Measuring 45 feet by 40 feet, it was painted onto the whole altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City by Italian artist Michelangelo between 1536 and 1541. The masterpiece shows several semi naked male figures rising to Heaven or descending into Hell on the day of the Last Judgement. Inspired by Dante\u2019s The Divine Comedy, the fresco was commissioned in 1534 by Pope Clement VII and completed under Pope Paul III. Advertisement\n\n'The woman kissing the cross has an important role, even if she appears hidden on the edges of the image.'\n\nAnother interesting detail in the painting is the depiction of the mythological figure Minos towards the bottom, who supervises the admission of the Damned into Hell.\n\nMinos bears a resemblance to Biagio da Cesena (1463-1544), a priest and contemporary critic of Michelangelo.\n\nWhile it was being painted, Biagio is said to have complained about 'The Last Judgment', calling it 'disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures, exposing themselves so shamefully'.\n\nMichelangelo reacted by giving Minos Biagio's face with donkey ears (indicating foolishness) and a snake biting on his penis.\n\nWhen when Biagio complained to Pope Paul III, the latter allegedly joked that his jurisdiction did not extend to hell and the portrait would have to remain.\n\nAdmittedly, at the time he worked on it, Michelangelo was condemned by Cardinal Oliviero Carafa, who accused the artist of immorality and obscenity as the genitals of several figures could be seen.\n\nSenior cardinals \u2013 including the master of ceremonies of the then Pope \u2013 called for the offending articles to be painted over with fig leaves as they were more typical of 'public baths than a Christian chapel'.\n\nThe Pope refused, but 24 years after Michelangelo died fig leaves were painted onto the fresco by one of his own students, Daniele Da Volterra.\n\nIn the bottom right of the painting is Minos, the mythological figure who supervises the admission of the Damned into Hell. Here, Minos bears a resemblance to Biagio da Cesena (1463-1544), a priest and contemporary critic of Michelangelo\n\nA study published by experts at the University of Paris-Saclay last month identified signs of breast cancer in a woman featured in another of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling fresco, 'The Flood'\n\nItalian historian Elena Lazzarini at Pisa University, previously said that the fresco was inspired by Michelangelo's visits to the gay saunas and brothels of Rome in the early 1500s.\n\nMrs Lazzarini said: 'The very virile male bodies you can see in the fresco have the build of labourers and manual workers of the day, very muscle bound and well built.\n\n'Michelangelo and several of his artist contemporaries would visit these brothels and saunas and you can see how they modelled their figures on the bodies of the men they found in there, including their pained expressions.\n\n'For example in the fresco you can see one poor soul being dragged down to Hell by his testicles whilst among those that are going to Heaven there is a lot of kissing and hugging, certainly of a homosexual nature.'\n\nA study published by experts at the University of Paris-Saclay last month identified signs of breast cancer in a woman featured in another of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling fresco, 'The Flood'.\n\nThis includes a deformed nipple and a slight bulge in her breast, which is 'consistent with a lump'.\n\nThe researchers believe the representation of breast cancer may have been a message on the inevitability of death.\n\nPainted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel between 1508 and 1512 (predating 'The Last Judgement'),'The Flood' portrays God flooding Earth as a punishment for humanity's immorality."

Musk's ally and fellow PayPal Mafia member David Sacks was recently appointed as Trump's AI and crypto czar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Sacks was tapped for the position, OpenAI chief Sam Altman \u2014 with whom Musk has a long-running feud \u2014 took to X to congratulate him on the role. Musk responded with a laughing emoji.\n\nFriar's comments follow Altman's remarks at The New York Times' DealBook summit last week, in which he said he didn't think Musk would use his political power to his advantage and boost his own AI startup, xAI.\n\nHe said, \"I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power to the degree that Elon would hurt competitors and advantage his own businesses.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk has been embroiled in a legal battle with OpenAI since March after twice suing the company behind ChatGPT. He accused the company and some of its cofounders of violating its founding charter with its plans to change its corporate structure to become a for-profit business, and of putting commercial interests ahead of its original mission to benefit humanity.\n\nAltman also addressed the feud between him and Musk at the DealBook conference, calling it \"tremendously sad\" and said he grew up looking to Musk as a \"mega hero.\"\n\nxAI was launched just 16 months ago, but it has quickly scaled up to be considered a competitor of OpenAI. In record time, the $50 billion startup built a supercomputer in Memphis that has 100,00 GPUs and is aiming to increase that to at least one million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI and Elon Musk didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours."

            "article_content": "Google reportedly wants the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to end Microsoft's exclusive cloud deal with OpenAI that requires anyone wanting access to OpenAI's models to go through Microsoft's servers.\n\nSomeone \"directly involved\" in Google's effort told The Information that Google's request came after the FTC began broadly probing how Microsoft's cloud computing business practices may be harming competition.\n\nAs part of the FTC's investigation, the agency apparently asked Microsoft's biggest rivals if the exclusive OpenAI deal was \"preventing them from competing in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market,\" multiple sources told The Information. Google reportedly was among those arguing that the deal harms competition by saddling rivals with extra costs and blocking them from hosting OpenAI's latest models themselves.\n\nIn 2024 alone, Microsoft generated about $1 billion from reselling OpenAI's large language models (LLMs), The Information reported, while rivals were stuck paying to train staff to move data to Microsoft servers if their customers wanted access to OpenAI technology. For one customer, Intuit, it cost millions monthly to access OpenAI models on Microsoft's servers, The Information reported.\n\nMicrosoft benefits from the arrangement\u2014which is not necessarily illegal\u2014of increased revenue from reselling LLMs and renting out more cloud servers. It also takes a 20 percent cut of OpenAI's revenue. Last year, OpenAI made approximately $3 billion selling its LLMs to customers like T-Mobile and Walmart, The Information reported.\n\nMicrosoft's agreement with OpenAI could be viewed as anti-competitive if businesses convince the FTC that the costs of switching to Microsoft's servers to access OpenAI technology is so burdensome that it's unfairly disadvantaging rivals. It could also be considered harming the market and hampering innovation by seemingly disincentivizing Microsoft from competing with OpenAI in the market.\n\nTo avoid any disruption to the deal, however, Microsoft could simply point to AI models sold by Google and Amazon as proof of \"robust competition,\" The Information noted. The FTC may not buy that defense, though, since rivals' AI models significantly fall behind OpenAI's models in sales. Any perception that the AI market is being foreclosed by an entrenched major player could trigger intense scrutiny as the US seeks to become a world leader in AI technology development."

            "article_content": "COMPANY NEWS: As businesses prepare for 2025, industry experts are forecasting significant shifts in how companies will handle and utilise customer data. These changes span across multiple domains, from data infrastructure to artificial intelligence, with implications for businesses of all sizes.\n\nTo understand these emerging trends, Amperity\u2019s industry leaders shared their insights on what lies ahead.\n\nThe Evolution of Data Infrastructure\n\nAt the foundation of these changes lies the transformation of data infrastructure itself. In this space, significant consolidation appears to be on the horizon.\n\nCaleb Benningfield\n\nCaleb Benningfield, Field CTO at Amperity, sees major changes coming to the Customer Data Platform (CDP) market.\n\n\"There has been no clear winner and investors will want to see action and CDPs will begin to merge or be acquired,\" he explains.\n\nBenningfield also predicts that companies will increasingly position themselves as alternatives to Salesforce Data Cloud while emphasising vendor independence. Additionally, he notes that \"zero-copy\" architectures will become essential for competitive CDPs.\n\nAI Transformation and Business Impact\n\nWhile data infrastructure provides the foundation, artificial intelligence is poised to be the driving force of innovation in 2025. The AI landscape is set for dramatic evolution, according to Joyce Gordon, Amperity's Head of Generative AI. She emphasises that AI adoption will create a clear divide between companies that thrive and those that struggle.\n\nJoyce Gordon\n\n\"These successful companies will make better decisions because their teams can easily access and understand data, deliver more personalised customer experiences using generative AI, and run more efficiently by using AI for tasks like drafting creative briefs and handling initial customer service responses,\" Gordon explains. \"Brands that aren't adopting AI with a cohesive strategy will fall behind.\"\n\nThe Path to AI Success\n\nHowever, implementing AI successfully requires more than just adopting the technology. Gordon particularly emphasises the importance of proper AI implementation.\n\n\"Companies will move beyond segmented AI-driven content, closer to one-to-one personalisation,\" she says.\n\n\"This shift is possible now because AI models are becoming smaller, cheaper, and more capable, and because companies are getting better at using them.\"\n\nHowever, Gordon cautions that success requires clean, well-organised customer data as a foundation.\n\nMedia Networks and Advertising Evolution\n\nAs businesses grapple with these technological changes, the media and advertising landscape is undergoing its own transformation.\n\nPeter Ibarra\n\nIn the media and monetisation sphere, Peter Ibarra, Head of Media and Adtech Solutions at Amperity, predicts significant changes in retail media networks (RMNs).\n\n\"The explosion of retail media networks over the past few years means we're close to a tipping point,\" he notes.\n\nIbarra explains that success will require these networks to mature their offerings and provide truly differentiated targeting and measurement capabilities.\n\nThe Future of Digital Advertising\n\nThis evolution in media networks is closely tied to broader changes in digital advertising. Despite Google's extension of third-party cookies, Ibarra believes advertisers won't slow their investments in alternative technologies.\n\n\"Brands will need to maximise the quality of their first-party signals as opposed to relying on the volume of their data,\" he states.\n\nHe also predicts that television advertising budgets will continue shifting from traditional linear TV to connected TV (CTV), with programmatic exchanges emerging as the winners.\n\nTransforming Customer Data Management\n\nThese changes in advertising and media naturally lead to questions about how businesses will manage their customer data going forward. Looking at the broader customer data landscape, Amperity CTO and co-founder Derek Slager sees fundamental changes ahead.\n\nDerek Slager\n\n\"The CDP category will continue to fragment, with vendors more explicitly aligning their positioning to their strengths rather than claiming to solve things entirely,\" he predicts.\n\nSlager believes that rather than seeking single-platform solutions, companies will increasingly adopt multiple specialised tools to address their customer data challenges.\n\nAnalytics and Real-Time Capabilities\n\nThis transformation in data management will be accompanied by significant changes in how businesses analyse and act on their data. Slager is particularly bullish on AI's role in transforming analytics.\n\n\"Dashboards are dead,\" he declares. \"Generative AI powered tools offering the ability to answer the questions that matter on-the-fly will be the new surface for analytics and decision making.\"\n\nSlager also predicts a resurgence in real-time capabilities across the entire data stack, driven by competition in the Cloud Data Warehouse market.\n\nThe Rise of Low-Code Solutions\n\nLooking to the future, perhaps the most transformative change will come from democratising access to these powerful technologies. Slager foresees the emergence of a new generation of AI-powered low-code and no-code tools that will quickly compete for enterprise use cases.\n\nThis development could dramatically change how businesses approach their data infrastructure and analytics needs in the coming year, making sophisticated data operations accessible to a broader range of organisations and users.\n\nAbout Amperity\n\nAmperity is the leading customer data platform (CDP) provider that helps companies put data to work to improve marketing performance, build long-term customer loyalty and drive revenue. Amperity is used by many of the world\u2019s most beloved brands, such as Alaska Airlines, Crocs, Endeavour Drinks, Kendra Scott, Kroger, Lucky Brand, Planet Fitness, Seattle Sounders FC, Under Armour and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts.

            "article_content": "I\u2019d like to think that as I grow older, I also grow wiser \u2014 at least in the shopping department. All those days of impulse purchasing regular-priced items? Gone. And with the new year around the corner, I\u2019ve resolved myself to hone my intentional shopping practices even more by handpicking stores that consistently offer great deals on chic pieces. Enter: Marshalls.\n\nFor many, the retail giant is already familiar. Some may recall hours-long shopping trips with their mothers growing up, while others make regular pilgrimages to the massive brick-and-mortar stores whenever they visit their hometowns. Few, however, know the many genius shopping hacks to snag the best deals, especially on trending styles.\n\nCelebrity stylist and Marshalls fashion style expert Sophie Lopez says, \u201cThere\u2019s something for everyone at Marshalls, whether you\u2019re trend-focused or somebody [who] doesn\u2019t like to follow trends.\u201d\n\nOn the trend front, Lopez says she easily spots runway styles at the store, including some of the biggest current aesthetics. \u201cRed is huge, plaid and checks are going to be, and leopard print is also gonna be huge\u201d both now and throughout 2025, predicts the expert. \u201cAll of these things are very available \u2014 you just go in and find them.\u201d\n\nFrom surprising designers you can shop to price tag colors to look out for (read: final clearance), below is a definitive guide to making the most out of your Marshalls shopping.\n\nThere\u2019s A Wide Designer Selection\n\nMy friends are always shocked to hear that the retail giant carries a wide array of luxury pieces. Ever wanted the viral Le Chiquito Jacquemus bag? A Chloe Marcie Medium satchel? Ferragamo\u2019s Vara Pumps? You could find them all on Marshalls\u2019 official website for significantly lower prices.\n\nThere\u2019s also a robust selection of contemporary designers, including House of Harlow, Lucky Brand, and Staud, among others, for every budget.\n\nOne caveat: If you\u2019re shopping online, you\u2019ll notice most designer names are hidden behind a \u201cReveal Designer\u201d button, so searching for pieces based on brand isn\u2019t as straightforward. But you can still utilize the item\u2019s name, material, pattern, or color to narrow down the search. It makes stumbling onto a designer gem even more of a treat.\n\nMerchandise Differs By Store\n\nPer the brand, no two Marshalls establishments carry the exact same products. Even the site offers a different selection of merchandise. So if you\u2019re looking for something specific, consider a store and website browsing combo, or multiple in-person locations for optimal browsing (and hopefully purchasing).\n\nShopping In Person? Start With The \u201cTrack\u201d\n\nOverwhelmed by the massive space and endless racks in store? The Marshalls team suggests starting your browsing along the \u201ctrack,\u201d the curated section in the center of the store. Some of the contemporary labels and trending pieces are highlighted there.\n\nIf you\u2019re shopping online, you can explore the curations to see what\u2019s trending in any given season and help narrow your search. For winter, collections include \u201cThe Cashmere Shop,\u201d \u201cThe Cozy Shop,\u201d \u201cThe Ski Shop,\u201d \u201cStocking Stuffers,\u201d and more.\n\nCome In Armed With A Strategy...\n\nThe merchandise stocked in stores and online is already based on trend forecasts. So, per Lopez, \u201cIf you go in knowing what you\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s going to be there. It\u2019s really quite easy.\u201d It\u2019s best if you have a strategy \u2014 whether you\u2019re looking for specific trends or runway dupes \u2014 and employ your eagle eye. \u201cIf you wanted to shop all the trends in one sitting, you would be able to find them all there,\u201d she says.\n\n...But Stay Open To Surprises\n\nLopez also encourages perusing even if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for \u2014 especially when looking for gifts. Her favorite is \u201cwhen you need to buy gifts for someone or you have multiple people to buy gifts for.\u201d She adds, \u201cAlso, because product changes so fast, you could go one week and go back the next and it will be different.\u201d Thousands of new pieces come in weekly, so there\u2019s always something new to find.\n\nJust grab it while you can \u2014 especially the designer pieces as those might not be restocked.\n\nSOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nAdd These Clearance Months To Your Cal\n\nWhile there are year-round deals in-store and online, the Marshalls team shared the best months to shop the biggest clearance events: January and July.\n\nThere\u2019s A Tag Color-Coding Scheme\n\nThe price tag colors each have specific meanings. White stands for \u201cregular price,\u201d purple tags are for \u201crunway\u201d pieces including high-end, contemporary, and couture fashion, while blue tags are used for co-ords. What you really want to look out for, however, are red and yellow, which stand for clearance and final clearance, respectively.\n\nShopping For Essentials? They\u2019re 20%-60% More Affordable\n\nThe retail giant is also the place to shop if you\u2019re looking to stock up on household essentials. Think: skin care, home cleaning products, bath products, hair and nail tools, and even snacks. Per the Marshalls team, prices are typically 20%-60% below full-price retailers\u2019 regular prices.\n\nDon\u2019t Sleep On Beauty\n\nEven fashion girls shouldn\u2019t sleep on Marshalls\u2019 beauty section \u2014 it has anything and everything. In terms of tools, I was pleasantly surprised by the range it carries. LED masks? Check. Microcurrent devices? Check. Hair tools? Aplenty.\n\nFragrance connoisseur? Marshalls can help you start your collection with labels like Byredo, Maison Margiela Replica, Jimmy Choo, and more.\n\nThe real jaw-dropper is the skin care and makeup selection, which I\u2019ve officially spent hours poring over. Brands include YSL Beauty, Gucci Beauty, Laura Mercier, Augustinus Bader, and La Prairie, among countless others, for mind-blowingly discounted prices. For example, you can get the cult-favorite Laneige Sleeping Mask for $15 (versus the $24 retail price) or a Gucci Matte Lipstick for $25, instead of the usual $47.\n\nGet Free Shipping With A Code\n\nAll online orders over $89 qualify for free shipping \u2014 just use the code \u201cSHIP89\u201d upon checkout (a pro tip direct from the brand). Shopping in person? Select stores offer a home delivery option priced based on location (in case you don\u2019t want to schlep your shopping bags home).\n\nSubscribe & Download The App\n\nThe brand\u2019s reps also encourage shoppers to stay connected online. As with any subscription, those who sign up for emails get info on exciting deals and new drops first.\n\nDownloading the app adds another fun layer to shopping. The Marshalls app features a visual search feature to recommend similar styles on the site. Snap a pic of a piece you want, upload it, and wait for the recs to come in.\n\nSource cited:\n\nSophie Lopez, celebrity stylist and Marshalls fashion style expert"

            "article_content": "Astronomers have discovered another mysterious and massive circle of radio light in space. The strange and vast circle of light is an example of an ORC (Odd Radio Circle), the origins of which are currently unknown.\n\nORCS, first discovered in 2019, are so vast they can be 10 times the width of the Milky Way, thus encompassing entire galaxies.\n\nThe newly found ORC, designated ORC J0219\u20130505, was discovered in data from the MIGHTEE survey conducted by the MeerKAT radio telescope located in the Meerkat National Park in the Northern Cape of South Africa. The 371,600 light-year-wide ORC seems to be associated with the elliptical galaxy WISEA J021912.43\u2013050501.8. It has features that seem to set it apart from other ORCs, including the fact that it appears fainter and that details of its structure reveal it leans to one side.\n\n\"Odd Radio Circles: Circles of radio emission found around distant galaxies that we still don't understand,\" lead researcher and Western Sydney University astronomer Ray Norris told Space.com. \"It's a completely unexpected discovery, not predicted by the physics we already know, and therefore revealing a gap in our knowledge.\n\n\"So we hope these will tell us something new about how galaxies form and interact.\"\n\nAs mentioned above, ORC J0219\u20130505 seems to differ from other previously discovered ORCs, which has at least answered one question about this strange astronomical phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\"All the ORCS we had previously discovered were very similar. We weren't sure whether this was because all ORCS really are similar or whether it was a selection bias in our detection methods,\" Norris said. \"This new ORC tells us it was indeed a selection effect.\"\n\nThe astronomer added that the faintness of this ORC is consistent with ORCS coming in a range of sizes and brightnesses. He compares this to the variations seen in radio galaxies, which have giant radio emission regions that extend well beyond their visible structure.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

The debate around ORCs concerns the source of these powerful shockwaves.\n\n\"There are two main schools of thought as to what causes this,\" Norris explained. \"One is that the circles of ORCs are caused by spheres of shocked gas surrounding a galaxy.\"\n\nThe astronomer said that in this case, the ring we see representing an ORC is actually just the cross-section of an expanding sphere caused by a shock wave.\n\nThis shock wave could be the result of a cosmic collision, either two galaxies colliding and merging or even two supermassive black holes merging.\n\nTwo supermassive black holes collide and merge. Is this the source of the shockwaves that create ORCs? (Image credit: NASA)\n\nAlternatively, Norris said that the rings could be caused by a plane shock wave from another source crossing a dead radio lobe from a supermassive black hole.\n\n\n\nThese lobes emerge from each side of feeding supermassive black holes and spread out to incredible distances.\n\nIn this case, Norris said that as the plane shock wave intersects the roughly spherical outer edge of the remnant lobe, it creates a ring of accelerated electrons that generate synchrotron radiation.\n\nThis multiwavelength image of the Cloverleaf ORC (odd radio circle) (Image credit: X. Zhang and M. Kluge (MPE), B. Koribalski (CSIRO))\n\nThe fact that ORC J0219\u20130505 differs from previously discovered ORCs could hint at which of these creation models is the accurate one.\n\n\"The offset between the center of the ring and the host galaxy isn\u2019t easy to explain in the merging supermassive black hole model,\" Norris explained. \"That was my favorite model, so I\u2019m not very happy about this!\"\n\nNorris pointed out that the discovery of ORC J0219\u20130505 shows there is \"still a fair way to go\" before scientists understand ORCs.\n\nThe astronomer said that in addition to investigating WISEA J021912.43\u2013050501.8, this ORC's galactic home, further with a large optical telescope, the team will also hunt for more ORCs as they attempt to solve this cosmic curiosity.\n\nThe team's research is reported in preprint form on the repository site arXiv."

            "article_content": "The recently discovered class of objects known as Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) has a new member: This one is fainter and smaller than previous discoveries and was only detected using an intense study of a small area of the sky. This leads the team responsible to suspect there are many similar examples waiting to be discovered when similar approaches are conducted elsewhere.\n\nA new era in radio telescope capacity has led to the discovery of several new sorts of astronomical objects that had never been seen before. In each case, astronomers were initially baffled by the findings, leading some to be given names that indicate that bewilderment \u2013 for example, Odd Radio Circles originally having been nicknamed WTFs. The source of at least one member of one of these categories \u2013 long-period radio transients \u2013 was revealed last month, but that\u2019s just the start of working out how they are made.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nORCs were first announced in 2020, and had astronomers so puzzled they initially suspected equipment error. As the name suggests, they form large, almost perfectly circular areas of the sky from which radio signals are received unlike anything seen before.\n\nThe most astonishing thing about ORCs is their size. When first discovered, astronomers could not tell if they were moderate-sized objects relatively close to us, or gigantic ones further away. Now, however, we know there are galaxies or active galactic nuclei at the heart of each. Measuring the distances to these galaxies revealed the first five ORCs to be discovered are 1-1.5 million lightyears across, a mind-bending size even for astronomers used to working on galactic scales.\n\nThe latest discovery, known as ORC J0219\u20130505, has a diameter of around 370,000 light-years, which would be enormous by any standards other than the previous members of the group. For example, it\u2019s more than twice the size of the galaxy at the circle\u2019s center, which is of similar size to our own Milky Way.\n\nProfessor Ray Norris of CSIRO led both the original ORC discovery and the new one. However, he explained to IFLScience that, at this point, knowledge of its nature is sparse.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAll ORCs are known to be rapidly expanding, so a smaller object might be a younger one. However, Norris told IFLScience he has \u201cNo idea,\u201d if this is the case. \u201cIt could also be about the medium it is expanding into,\u201d he explained. A slightly less complete vacuum between galaxies might restrict the ORC\u2019s expansion. Similarly, Norris said, the team can\u2019t say why this ORC is fainter than all the others.\n\nAlthough they appear circular in two dimensions, we now know that ORCs are spheres surrounding central galaxies, created by some sort of shock around a billion years ago.\n\nThe original ORC, looking very similar.

In the last case, electrons stripped from the gas are much lighter and therefore travel further than the gas itself, and could be producing the radio waves while invisible to us by other means.\n\nNorris told IFLScience he previously favored the merging black holes explanation, \u201cBut the offset between the center of ORC J0219\u20130505\u2019s sphere and the supermassive black hole is difficult to account for.\u201d On that basis, Norris thinks collisions between gas clouds during galactic mergers are probably the front-runner. These collisions are thought to create shockwaves that accelerate electrons beyond the merged galaxy, but Norris considers the issue still wide open.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nORC J0219\u20130505 was found as part of a 564.2-hour study by the MeerKAT radio telescope of a 20 degree2 area of the sky. Since something this faint would probably not have been detected without such an in-depth survey by an instrument like MeerKAT, the authors expect similar objects are waiting to be discovered once the rest of the sky gets similar attention.\n\nNorris told IFLScience that the most significant part of the discovery is that all previous ORCs are very similar in size, brightness, distance, and age. This led astronomers to wonder if something was special about these conditions, or if the similarity reflected selection bias from the methods used to find them. Adding something significantly smaller and fainter to the mix makes it likely we\u2019ll spot plenty of smaller ORCs (goblins, perhaps?) once suitable techniques are expanded, and there may be other subgroups to come as well.\n\nThe paper has been accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and is posted as a preprint on ArXiv.org.\n\n[H/T Phys.org]"

            "article_content": "New research published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters suggests that the Moon's oldest and largest impact crater, the South Pole-Aitken Basin, may be more circular than previously believed. For many years, scientists thought the basin had an elongated, elliptical shape. However, a team of scientists from the University of Maryland presented the results of a new analysis indicating that the collision which formed the basin occurred at a more vertical angle, resulting in a rounder shape.\n\nThe South Pole-Aitken Basin is considered the largest and oldest known impact structure on the Moon, with dimensions of 2,400 by 2,050 kilometers and a depth reaching 8 kilometers. It is located on the far side of the Moon and was first photographed by the Soviet spacecraft Luna 3 in 1959, and later by NASA's Clementine spacecraft in 1996. Its age is estimated to be more than 4 billion years, and many other impacts have obscured its original appearance.\n\n\"It's challenging to study the South Pole-Aitken Basin holistically due to its sheer enormousness, which is why scientists are still trying to learn its shape and size,\" said Assistant research scientist Hannes Bernhardt, who led the study. The team re-examined the basin and determined it has a more rounded shape than previously thought, as reported by Space.com.\n\nThe researchers reached this conclusion by studying data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which provided insights into the distribution of materials resulting from the impact. They used the data to find and analyze more than 200 mountain-shaped formations scattered around the basin. The shape of these formations and their distances from one another signify a more rounded crater that would be created from a vertical impact.\n\n\"The rounded shape implies that the debris from the impact are distributed around the point of impact more evenly than was originally assumed,\" the researchers stated. According to Bernhardt, this means \"Artemis astronauts or robots in the South Pole region may be able to closely study rocks from deep within the Moon's mantle or crust\u2014materials that are typically impossible for us to access.\" Bernhardt is cited by Space.com.\n\nThis new understanding challenges previous theories. For many years, it was believed that the South Pole-Aitken Basin had an oval or elliptical shape. Based on this, studies established that the crater was formed by an object striking the Moon at a shallow angle, with scientists comparing the event to a stone skipping on water. The prevailing theory suggested that the collision resulted in relatively few fragments being scattered around the South Pole of the Moon.\n\nThe new findings suggest that the impact was more vertical, \"possibly similar to dropping a rock straight down onto the ground,\" Bernhardt said. \"Our results may play a key role in understanding the evolution of the Moon,\" he added.\n\nRecent data from the Indian spacecraft Chandrayaan-3 discovered minerals presumably related to mantle materials near the Moon's South Pole, which also agrees with the theory of a vertical impact, as reported by Gazeta.ru.\n\nNASA plans to send astronauts close to the Moon's south pole again as part of the Artemis missions. Artemis 2, the first mission of its kind since 1972, is set to bring astronauts to the lunar surface in April 2026, according to Space.com. The new findings may have significant implications for these missions, as astronauts or robots may be able to study materials from deep within the Moon's mantle or crust.\n\nPrevious research published in October in Nature Astronomy dated the South Pole-Aitken Basin to between 4.32 and 4.33 billion years old. In that study, researchers determined the basin's age by dating uranium and lead found inside the Northwest Africa 2995 lunar meteorite, discovered in Algeria in 2005, as reported by Space.com.

            "article_content": "00:00\n\nHi everybody, welcome to DEMO, the show where companies come in and they show us their latest products and platforms. Today, I'm joined by Neil Miller, he is the Director of Product Marketing at Kissflow. Welcome to the show, Neil. So tell us a little bit about what Kissflow is, and then what are you going to show us here today?\n\n\n\n00:14\n\nSo Kissflow is a no-code, low-code, application platform that really spreads the power of application development across the enterprise.\n\n\n\n00:21\n\nGenerally, who is this designed for? Is it designed for product developers, or is it other people within the company that might not be a developer?\n\n\n\n00:30\n\nYes, so Kissflow is a unique product in that it's really built for both groups, so it can handle the people that like the high-powered, low-code developers who really want to build a lot of things out -- they don't need a lot of certifications or anything. It's a platform they can get on to build things very quickly and easily. But then the other side, you also have junior developers, business analysts and specifically process owners, who want to build their own thing themselves. The platform is easy enough for them to use that they can build their own applications too.\n\n\n\n00:56\n\nDo you subscribe to the whole citizen developer movement that we're seeing in the space, because of skill shortages and things like that?\n\n\n\n01:04\n\nAbsolutely. Citizen development is one of the main themes we like to play into. Now our platform is very governed, so IT admins have the ability to govern the entire platform and know what's going on in there. But at the same time, we believe that people who actually run these processes probably know best what's there. So as long as you give them the right tools, and you give them enough training, they're able to build what they need.\n\n\n\n01:25\n\nBecause I guess if I was in IT, the biggest fear would be like, \u201cWait, you're we're giving power to who?\u201d Because the last thing you want is me programming something, with very little design or development skills. So why should companies care about Kissflow versus maybe some of the other platforms out there, or some of the other processes that go on.\n\n\n\n01:42\n\nLike I said, Kissflow\u2019s unique thing is that one, it\u2019s just super easy to use. You're going to see it in the demo here a second. The layout, the feel of it, is just really geared towards someone who knows what they want but maybe doesn't have the development skills about it. There's a lot of things we won't show today that show the power of the low-code side of it as well, so that even a higher-powered developer can come in and really do what they want to do, but that's one thing that really makes it easy, is just the ease of use and be able to generate things quickly. So even somebody who's in the IT department that just wants to build a lot of apps very quickly to get things out of their backlog, they can really easily build dozens of apps on this.\n\n\n\n02:16\n\nIf companies didn't have this, would they just be relying on developers to do a lot of the requests that are coming in? Does this offload some of those processes to people that usually don't have those skills?\n\n\n\n02:26\n\nSo a few different things. One is that they would either just be custom developing things. Second is they might be using a different low-code platform, but typically, you're only going to be building two or three applications a year on those really big platforms that are out there. Kissflow is more like, \u201cHey, give us a few dozen that we're going to get done in a year.\u201d Then the citizen developers, the other thing they would be using would just be spreadsheets, Excel or something like that, to build what they need. So this is their option to actually get something that's an improvement on Excel.\n\n\n\n02:53\n\nSo let's go into the demo. Tell us what you're going to show us.\n\n\n\n03:00\n\nWhat you see here is the basics of a process. So we have a few different modules in Kissflow, but the process builder is one of the easiest to understand, and the one that generates the most interest for most people. So we start off with a form, which is a little bit interesting. Most people are going to say, OK, build us a data table or something like that. But we actually want to start with a form, because that's where the process owner is usually going to start. They know what they want to do. In this situation, we're looking at asset disposal requests. So this is, again, something maybe your admin team is going to use, or maybe somebody else in the IT department is going to use, but it's really something that the person who is building this knows what they need, and they just want to be able to bring that in.\n\n\n\nSo the form is very, very simple. It's all drag and drop. We have tons of form fields that are available here on the left, all sorts of things, from very simple things to very complicated. We also have some AI features here. So if you want to, just based on the name asset disposal request, you're going to be able to generate types of fields you might need to know. So if somebody's building it for the first time, they're going to be able to bring those in. They can do anything here, building out sections, you're also able to refer back to fields. We have remote lookup, so you can go to databases outside of Kissflow and bring those things in. Every field has the ability to change the settings, to add validations, add visibility requirements, stylize it the way you want, and even add these custom events, which is more the low-code part of what's going on. So the field, the form is one of the things that is most fun to use, I feel like to build in, but then you want to take that form and drive it through a workflow. So that's where we go to the second phase. So here again, this is one of the powers of Kissflow, is just being able to see how simple it is to build things out. Again, we have these AI features where they will suggest steps for you based on the name of the platform. Here I have a few that are already added in. It's as easy as adding in new steps. Adding in you can do something like a parallel branch where two different things may be happening at the same time. Or you want to create conditions based on how things happen. So all these things are available to just make it easy.\n\n\n\nOne of the best things about it is how you assign things. A lot of these features, a lot of other platforms, don't have so easily to do in terms of if you're going to assign it to a group of people, if you're going to assign it to everyone, if everyone needs to approve it before it goes forward, if only a few people need to approve it. If you want to assign things to one person based on the region that they're in, but a different region needs to go to somebody else, that's really easy to do in Kissflow. If you're trying to hand-code a lot of the things, it becomes very difficult to do. You can also build in these conditions. You can look at different SLAs, actions, deadlines, field permissions that are available at different steps. That's really one of the great, but I'm able to create services requests. I'm able to create product marketing requests based on these workflows and just set up the way I want to do it.\n\n\n\n05:46\n\nDo you find that when you're doing the application itself, does it get sent to approval from the IT department to make sure that you're not missing anything? Or does another developer check your work before it gets deployed? Or because, if it's internal, maybe you don't have to do that?\n\n\n\n06:02\n\nSo within the citizen development framework, which we also try to align ourselves a lot, you kind of have these zonings of applications, they're based on the risk and based on the complexity. So a lot of risk that's involved and a lot of complexity, you really want your IT team to be hands-on doing those things. Maybe you're going to let a citizen developer work on a form or something like that. Then you have things that are less risk, but maybe with a little bit of complexity. That's where someone just needs a mentor to be able to come along and make sure, \u201cHey, you did it right, you didn't screw up anything.\u201d Then you have this other area where it's like, it's low risk, it's low complexity, and pretty much you're just letting those people just build whatever they want, because they're not going to mess up too much.\n\n\n\nSo this particular one, asset disposal, there may be some concerns about some risks that are around there, but not too much. This would be an example of one that would probably be fine for a citizen developer just to build on their own, and just for the data governance platform, just to know that it\u2019s there. But other apps you're going to want to have people more involved in it.\n\n\n\nAfter you build out all the steps that you want, and again, this can get as complex as you want. We've seen many very big workflows that go on, then you go on to permissions. So here, at each step in the process, you're able to figure out if fields should be editable, if they're read-only, or if they're hidden. You can set these rules across steps or just for individual ones. It's really just a way to make sure to ensure some privacy issues, or ensure some scalability issues, as you're building these out to make sure that each step is what it needs to be.\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite features within this particular function in Kissflow is the simulate button. So here, instead of having to go live with something and then test it out and figure it out, this is really a way to just test it on the back end really quickly. Here I can simulate it as myself, or as lots of other people, and see what it would be like. I can see, these fields are obviously like a read-only field, but this one is something that I can use. And if I say, \u201cOkay, well, I didn't want that to be like that,\u201d I can just go back into the process and figure that out.\n\n\n\nWith each step I can see things. I can mark it, and I can submit it as done, and see what it looks like in the next section. You can also see what it looks like on a mobile app. So this is really the fun side of Kissflow, I would say, in order to be able to see what's going on and be able to build it. In this particular process builder, deploying an app is just as simple as clicking this button to go live. Now it's live. So now at this point, this is more like the runtime. So in here, a new person would be able to get in. They're going to click this New Item button. They're going to see all the same fields that you had with Kissflow, with our process builder. You're going to see exactly when something was started, when the next step was done. So these are going to have times if they had SLAs attached to them. The SLA is going to be there to know if it was handled appropriately or not. You can also add comments for people that are involved in the workflow. So if there's some extra things that need to be added into all these things, so you get this big data trail as well. So a lot of this use of Kissflow, with an approval management cycle, you're going to be able to get all the things you need, as opposed to just trying to handle something on either a simple workflow builder, on Excel or something.\n\n\n\n09:01\n\nYou were talking to me before the show that you've got some integrations that you wanted to show off?\n\n\n\n09:06\n\nSo this part of Kissflow is about approvals. So you're talking about mostly human-based ones, but also you can build a lot of really intense integrations as well. So here, this is an integration we built for another process was about scheduling interviews with customers. This is pretty easy, and again, you're going to see a similar workflow builder here, but here we're not talking about human elements. Now we don't have approvers. Now we are just going into different systems. So here, when a status of an item is updated, we're going to make sure certain data sets match and then send an email. Those are easy to do, but again, you can see lots of different connections we have here, lots of things within Kissflow. But then also outside of Kissflow, as well, other tools that if you want to go into one of your CMS or your ERP system and make a connection, those are very easy to do. Again, this is still no code. We're still talking about people like you and me that aren't technically minded, that can just go in and make what they need to do. Maybe I get into a little bit of trouble. I need to ask somebody, Hey, what I do here, and that's very easy, just to go and then you feel really empowered as a system developer.\n\n\n\n10:05\n\nYou've got a lot of features other than the stuff that you just showed me. But do you offer a free trial? Is it? Or how do you get set up on this?\n\n\n\n10:12\n\nYeah, free trials are available. As long as you go to our website, request a meeting with our sales team, they'll kind of get a figure for how you want to use it. One of our big things is that we like to see companies with a long list of backlogged apps. If you have five to 25 apps that you're like, \u201cMan, I wish somebody would take these off our plate,\u201d that's our kind of customer. So if you're in that that zone and you really want to see it, or you want to try out citizen development as well, unleashing something for the rest of the organization, then come in, we'll figure out if it's right for you, and make sure you get set up.\n\n\n\n10:43\n\nAnd it looks simple to operate, so I'm also assuming it's going to be simple to install. You're not talking like a three-month long install process.\n\n\n\n10:49\n\nAbsolutely not. We like to see people get up and going as soon as possible. We don't have any long certification courses. You get in, you learn the platform, and then again, depending on if you want to turn this over to people, citizen developers, or IT departments. IT departments are going to be very fast with this, and like, within a week, they're going to be up and building MVPs, and things much more complicated. What I was showing you before was our standard runtime that you can see with a certain process, but we have a page builder, you can build a custom UI, so you can have everything unique. You can build your own dashboards or your own reports. This is just like one small, easy part of Kissflow, but it can really be very powerful.\n\n\n\n11:27\n\nAll right, give me the website again.\n\n\n\n11:29\n\nKissflow.com.\n\n\n\n11:30\n\nNeil Miller, thanks again for joining us on the show.

Learn about some of the rules connected to this promotion in the section below.\n\nJackpot City online casino bonus terms and conditions\n\nNo online casino is in the business of giving away money for free. The best online casinos always set clear terms and conditions for bonuses to help ensure they eventually will turn a profit.\n\nI found certain aspects of the Jackpot City online casino welcome bonus terms to be unfavorable to players. Overall, however, this remains a solid signup offer for casino fans throughout New Jersey.\n\nSome of the most important rules connected to this offer include:\n\nOnly available to players age 21 or older.\n\nOnly available with a minimum deposit of $10.\n\nWelcome bonus must be claimed within seven days of signing up.\n\nAll casino credits come with a 25x playthrough requirement.\n\nOnly slots count toward satisfying this playthrough requirement.\n\nKeep in mind this offer is available to players who are located within New Jersey. There is no requirement to live in New Jersey to claim this bonus.\n\nUnfortunately, it does come with a 25x playthrough requirement. This is extremely high and will be very difficult for even the busiest casino players to satisfy. To make things worse, only playing slots will count toward satisfying this requirement.\n\nDon\u2019t wait around to claim this bonus after signing up. New players have only seven days to claim this offer after creating a new account.\n\nThere are some good and bad aspects of this welcome offer. It certainly gives players the opportunity to quickly increase the amount of funds they have to play with. The high playthrough requirement simply will make it difficult for players to turn these funds into real money.\n\nJackpot City promo code vs. the competition\n\nJackpot City Casino app\n\nScreenshots of the Jackpot City Casino app.Apple Store\n\nJackpot City Casino can be accessed using a web browser or via its dedicated mobile app. This app can be downloaded quickly via the Apple Store and Google Play Store.\n\nThe mobile app looks extremely modern and sleek, maintaining the web version\u2019s purple-and-black theme.

These come primarily from three top developers: Oddworks, Evolution Games and DGC Games.\n\nVisit the Jackpot City homepage, and you\u2019ll immediately be presented with a massive variety of slot options. The most popular games are featured at the top of the page.\n\nI would prefer to see Jackpot City Casino categorize its slots based on their type. At the moment, there is no ability to filter slot games based on whether they are 3-reel, 5-reel or progressive slots.\n\nWith that being said, most users will have no trouble finding the slot games they are searching for thanks to the helpful search function.\n\nSome of the most popular slot titles here include:\n\nCash Eruption\n\nPegasus Cash Spree (Exclusive)\n\nReign of Fire\n\nJackpot City table games\n\nFans of table games are not out of luck playing Jackpot City Casino, either. At the moment, this online casino provides 40 table games to its players.\n\nThis includes all of the most popular table games such as blackjack, roulette, baccarat and video poker. Users also will find unique variations of these games.\n\nI was very impressed with the table game selection of Jackpot City Casino. As a personal fan of table games, I enjoyed testing out the game variations that are available.\n\nSome of the most popular table games at Jackpot City Casino include:\n\nLightning Roulette: First Person\n\nMultihand Blackjack\n\n3 Card Hold\u2019Em (Win up to 100x your side bet)\n\nJackpot City live dealer games\n\nThe list of live dealer games at Jackpot City Casino is also impressive. This online casino provides its members with 17 different live dealer games to choose from.\n\nThe live dealer games at Jackpot City Casino are powered by Evolution Gaming. Users will find all of the classic types of live dealer games, including blackjack, roulette and baccarat.\n\nAs expected, unique variations of these games are also available. All of the live dealer games at Jackpot City Casino run smoothly. There are enough to keep just about every type of casino fan satisfied.\n\nSome of the most popular live dealer options at Jackpot City Casino include:\n\nLive Dealer Lightning Roulette\n\nLive Dealer Infinite Blackjack\n\nLive Dealer Three Card Poker\n\nBanking options at Jackpot City\n\nAs a modern online casino, it should come as no surprise to see Jackpot City Casino providing its users with a large selection of banking options. Most users will have no trouble finding options to deposit their funds.\n\nA breakdown of the deposit options available at Jackpot City Casino:\n\nCash at Cashier (Golden Nugget Casino - Atlantic City)\n\nVisa\n\nPayPal\n\nVenmo\n\nVIP Preferred\n\nPlay+ Card\n\nMasterCard\n\nApple Pay\n\nSkrill\n\nJackpot City Casino payout times\n\nWithdrawing money from Jackpot City Casino is never difficult, either. This casino provides seven options to collect funds, including many of the same methods available to deposit money.\n\nA complete breakdown of the withdrawal options available at Jackpot City:\n\nCash at Cashier \u2013 Golden Nugget Casino-Atlantic City (Instant)\n\nDebit Card \u2013 Visa/MasterCard (1-2 days)\n\nPlay+ Card (1-2 days)\n\nPayPal (1-2 days)\n\nSkrill (1-2 days)\n\nVenmo (1-2 days)\n\nVIP Preferred (1-2 days)\n\nJackpot City Casino screenshot.Jackpot City Casino\n\nJackpot City online casino bonuses and promos for existing players\n\nJackpot City Casino provides only a couple of bonuses and promotions for its existing players. I would prefer to see more of these offers available. For now, this platform focuses more on its gaming options, rather than promotional offers.\n\nSome of the most popular promotions offered by Jackpot City Casino:\n\nDaily bonus wheel: Every day, members of Jackpot City Casino can spin the bonus wheel to receive a random prize. This bonus generally comes in the form of casino credits or free spins. Simply log into your account each day to take advantage of this unique offer.\n\nBirthday bonus: Jackpot City Casino wants to help you celebrate your birthday by offering a unique bonus on the special day. This bonus can vary and often comes in the form of casino credits or free spins.\n\nCustomer service at Jackpot City\n\nThe customer support at Jackpot City Casino is, for the most part, effective. Users have access to three forms of support, each of which I found to be helpful.\n\nThese support options include:\n\nLive chat: Members of Jackpot City Casino can utilize the live chat feature to speak with the platform\u2019s chatbot. Unfortunately, this live chat feature does not connect players with a human support representative. While this option can be helpful, it essentially acts as a more efficient FAQ system. I would much rather have the option to speak with an actual human, rather than the platform\u2019s chatbot.\n\nFAQ page: Jackpot City Casino also has a comprehensive FAQ page. Here, members will find answers to many of the most common questions asked by casino players. That includes questions related to payments, games, promotions and more.\n\nEmail support: In case you have a question that was not answered via the live chat or FAQ page, feel free to use the platform\u2019s email support. Here, members will receive answers to their questions from a real Jackpot City representative. I tested this feature and received a response to my query in less than 48 hours.\n\nPros and cons of Jackpot City Casino\n\nEvery online casino has good and not-so-good features. Jackpot City Casino is no different. While it excels in most areas, there are some things that I believe this casino can improve upon.\n\nPros Cons \u2022 Sleek, modern design\n\n\u2022 Great variety of games\n\n\u2022 Good selection of banking options\n\n\u2022 Daily promotions for existing players \u2022 Somewhat limited customer support options\n\n\u2022 Large welcome bonus playthrough requirement\n\nJackpot City online casino FAQ\n\nWhere is Jackpot City legal?\n\nJackpot City Casino is currently legal to play in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. It is still fairly new to the US and could expand into more states in the coming years.\n\nDoes Jackpot City pay real money?\n\nJackpot City Casino is a real money online casino.

One thing the team didn\u2019t mention in its live stream or patch notes was that update 2.2 would also bring a quest based on Balatro, 2024\u2019s card game indie darling that is nominated for Game of the Year at this year\u2019s Game Awards. If you haven\u2019t booted up Cyberpunk since the update but are curious about how to see this unexpected crossover, we\u2019ve got the rundown on where to go in Night City to start the quest.\n\n\n\nFor most people, the quest should begin fairly easily. If you boot up the game, you should receive a text message from someone named Jim B (a reference to Balatro\u2019s clown mascot Jimbo) who will send V on a treasure hunt around the city, with clues and photos leading you to areas adorned with hidden Jimbo logos. Throughout the quest, you\u2019ll find Balatro-themed cosmetics, including a trophy you can put on display in your apartment.\n\nHowever, as of this writing, the quest might be bugged, as some players, myself included, are not receiving a text message from Jim B upon start-up. I tried riding around Night City to see if the clown might get in touch with me, but had no luck. I also checked the spot where the first logo is supposed to appear, and it seems like it doesn\u2019t show up in the world if you haven\u2019t started the quest. We\u2019ve reached out to CD Projekt Red about this issue and will update the story when we hear back. In the meantime, if you\u2019re looking for some help on all the clue locations, YouTuber vinal has a video showing each location on Night City\u2019s map:\n\nAll of this launches alongside a line of Cyberpunk X Balatro merchandise including shirts and a hoodie, all of which are available for pre-order on CD Projekt Red\u2019s website. While Cyberpunk 2077 may be getting a little love even four years after its release, most of CD Projekt Red\u2019s team has been moved to other projects, including a sequel codenamed Orion. We don\u2019t know much about the game, but there\u2019s reason to believe it will have some kind of multiplayer mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

But how did this holiday of miracles and resilience become such a cherished celebration\u2014and what makes this year's timing so unique?\n\nIn a rare, but not unprecedented calendar overlap, the first night of Hanukkah falls on Christmas Day, intertwining two deeply meaningful celebrations on the same day.\n\nWhen is Hanukkah 2024?\n\nThis year, the first night of Hanukkah falls on Wednesday, Dec. 25.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Bergen Record, the first night of Hanukkah last fell on Christmas Day in 2005. Before that, the overlap occurred in 1959 and 1921. The first night of Hanukkah will not land on Christmas Day again until 2035 and then again in 2054.\n\nWho celebrates Hanukkah?\n\nHanukkah is a traditional Jewish holiday, celebrated by Jewish people around the world. The religious holiday is also called the \"festival of lights.\"\n\nWhat does Hanukkah celebrate? Why is Hanukkah celebrated for 8 days?\n\nWhile Hanukkah often coincides with the Christmas season, it is far from being \"the Jewish Christmas,\" as it\u2019s sometimes mistakenly labeled.\n\nHanukkah commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem following the Maccabees' unlikely victory over the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE. Central to the celebration is the miracle of the oil: a single day's supply that burned for eight days, symbolizing resilience and divine intervention.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite its festive traditions, Hanukkah is not the most significant holiday in Judaism. Unlike Christmas for Christians, Hanukkah does not hold a central place in religious practice and is not even widely considered among the top five major holidays in Judaism.\n\nA man passes a large menorah in Philadelphia, PA\n\nHow many nights is Hanukkah?\n\nHanukkah is celebrated for eight days and eight nights.\n\nKey Jewish holidays\n\nIn 2024, several key Jewish holidays have already passed. These are among the most significant, according to Religion News:\n\nRosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) marks the beginning of the Jewish calendar year and initiates the Ten Days of Repentance. This period encourages introspection and spiritual renewal. Traditions include blowing the shofar and eating symbolic foods such as apples dipped in honey, which represent hopes for a sweet year ahead.\n\nYom Kippur (Day of Atonement) is considered the holiest day in Judaism, focused on repentance, prayer and fasting. It is observed with a 25-hour fast, intensive synagogue services, and seeking forgiveness from God and others. Yom Kippur concludes the Ten Days of Repentance, providing an opportunity for spiritual cleansing and renewal.\n\nShabbat is a weekly day of rest, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening. It celebrates God\u2019s creation of the world and the covenant between God and the Jewish people. Shabbat is a time for prayer, reflection, and spending quality time with family and community, offering spiritual renewal and rest.\n\nPassover (Pesach) commemorates the Exodus from Egypt and the liberation of the Israelites from slavery. The holiday is celebrated with a Seder meal, which retells the Exodus story, and by eating matzah (unleavened bread). It emphasizes themes of freedom, deliverance, and gratitude for God's protection.\n\nSukkot (Feast of Tabernacles) is a harvest festival that also remembers the 40 years the Israelites spent wandering in the desert. Observants build and dwell in a sukkah (a temporary hut) and wave the lulav and etrog (a palm frond and citrus fruit). The festival celebrates the bounty of the earth and God\u2019s protection during the Israelites' wilderness journey.\n\nShavuot (Feast of Weeks) celebrates the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Observances include all-night Torah study, special prayers, and the consumption of dairy foods. It highlights the importance of the Torah in Jewish law and practice.\n\nJewish holiday calendar in 2025\n\nFast of Tevet 10 : Friday, Jan. 10\n\n15 Shevat (Tu B'Shevat ): Thursday, Feb. 13\n\nPurim : Thursday, Mar. 13 - Friday, Mar. 14\n\nPassover (Pesach) : Saturday, Apr. 12 - Sunday, Apr. 20\n\nSecond Passover (Pesach Sheni) : Monday, May 12\n\nLag B'Omer: Friday, May 16\n\nShavuot : Sunday, June 1 - Tuesday, June 3\n\nThe Three Weeks : Sunday, July 13 - Sunday, Aug. 3\n\nRosh Hashanah : Monday, Sept. 22 - Wednesday, Sept. 24\n\nYom Kippur: Wednesday, Oct. 1 - Thursday, Oct. 2\n\nSukkot : Monday, Oct. 6 - Monday, Oct. 13\n\nShemini Atzeret & Simchat Torah : Monday, Oct. 13 - Wednesday, Oct. 15\n\nChanukah : Sunday, Dec. 14 - Monday, Dec. 22\n\nFast of Tevet 10: Tuesday, Dec. 30\n\nSee full description and work guidelines.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Austin American-Statesman: How many nights is Hanukkah 2024?

            "article_content": "Key Takeaways\n\nIn 2025, workers will continue to push for flexible work arrangements that prioritize work-life balance.\n\nTo fill short-term business needs, employers will increasingly turn to freelancers and contractors.\n\nDemand will remain strong for specialized artificial intelligence roles, and companies will also prioritize hiring and developing non-technical talent to harness the benefits of AI tools.\n\nAs workers prepare to say goodbye to 2024 and its notable workplace trends, here are the trends some workplace experts expect to see in 2025.\n\n\n\nEmployees Will Build Stronger Work-Life Boundaries\n\nThe traditional 9-to-5 schedule will continue to erode, giving way to flexible work arrangements that prioritize work-life balance. \u201cRemote work, hybrid models and asynchronous communication will become the norm, fostering greater autonomy and job satisfaction,\u201d said certified business and executive coach Bethany Plaza, in an email.\n\nRegardless of labor market pressures and whether return-to-office mandates become more widespread, employee demand for work-life fit is expected to keep growing.\n\nForward-thinking human resource leaders should anticipate workplace flexibility to become a competitive necessity. \u201cIt is worth noting that 82% of executives plan to make working styles more flexible in the next two years, including exploration of four-day workweeks,\u201d said Lexi Clarke, chief people officer of the compensation data provider Payscale, in an email.\n\nAs employees push for greater flexibility and friction heightens in the employer-employee power dynamic, employers can\u2019t afford to ignore employee sentiment. \u201cPrioritizing fair pay, flexibility and career growth will be essential, as a pro-employer stance will only increase tensions,\u201d Clarke said. \u201c(Human resources) leaders need to continue to balance advocating for workers with business priorities.\u201d\n\nGary Gray, who\u2019s been an entrepreneur for two decades as co-founder and CEO of Coupon Chief, believes that the trend of quiet quitting will evolve into what he calls \u201cintentional engagement.\u201d He expects that as more employees realize they don\u2019t have to burn out to be loyal or productive, they\u2019ll start setting clear boundaries around work-life balance while still being committed to their roles.\n\n\u201cFor the past few years, the quiet quitting movement has been getting a bad rep, even though it\u2019s mainly been employees claiming back their power \u2013 especially those who have been overworked or exploited in subtle ways,\u201d Gray said in an email. \u201cCompanies are going to be more accommodating here. I think they finally recognize and support employees making this boundary very clear, especially if they are as committed to work-life balance as they claim to be.\u201d\n\n\n\nFreelancers Will Fill Skills Gaps While Lifelong Learning Takes Center Stage\n\nAs technology evolves faster than many can keep pace, the demand for adaptable, lifelong learners is predicted to soar. \u201cOrganizations will prioritize continuous learning and development programs to equip their workforce with the skills needed to thrive in the future of work,\u201d Plaza said.\n\nTo fill skills gaps and adapt to short-term business needs, the gig economy may expand as employers turn to freelancers and contractors, saving on full-time employee costs. HR leaders will need to prepare to integrate gig workers into strategic workforce planning and adopt technology to source talent and match tasks to skills. \u201cWith the gig economy booming, it\u2019s time for HR to get serious about integrating freelancers into our strategy,\u201d Clarke said. \"It\u2019s not just about filling gaps. It\u2019s about smart hiring, efficient onboarding and fair compensation.\u201d\n\n\n\nAI Will Affect Everything From Personalization to Compensation\n\nArtificial intelligence is at the top of the watch list for many executives, entrepreneurs, career coaches and workplace trend-watchers. Plaza believes that AI will more definitively revolutionize how people work in 2025 by tailoring experiences to individual needs. \u201cFrom personalized learning paths to AI-driven career coaching, technology will empower employees to reach their full potential,\u201d Plaza said.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence, or GenAI, will shift workplace dynamics in favor of versatile generalists who can skillfully use AI tools to their strategic advantage, according to Mark Mader, president and CEO of Smartsheet, a workplace collaboration software maker. He said that while demand for specialized AI roles will continue, workers should look for more organizations valuing nontechnical talent that can effectively harness AI to enhance productivity, ushering in a \u201crenaissance age for the generalist.\u201d In such an age, the future of work might involve repetitive tasks becoming streamlined, freeing up knowledge workers to focus more on creative, strategic work.\n\n\u201cOrganizations have spent a disproportionate amount of capital hiring hyper-specialized talent with deep technical knowledge for years,\u201d Mader said in an email. \u201cNow, with the democratization of GenAI, the value offered by hiring \u2018capable generalists\u2019 is on the rise. People who articulately frame their thoughts, pose well-formed questions (prompts) and exercise AI tools to their advantage stand to benefit greatly.\u201d\n\nDemand for specialized AI talent \u2013 model developers, AI ops talent, and engineers to build and maintain infrastructure \u2013 will persist in 2025, according to Mader. However, the demand for nontechnical talent may shift to a more balanced state. \u201cOrganizations will place as much worth on employees with the skills to extract value from platforms as those who build them,\u201d Mader said."

Last week, a court upheld a law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell the app to a US-approved buyer by mid-January. (TikTok has since filed for an injunction to stop the ban).\n\nLawmakers on both sides have shared concerns that TikTok, which has more than 150 million American users, could be a threat to national security due to its ties to China. At the same time, the company has been working to attract new users and encourage people to spend more time on the platform.\n\nThe report said some TikTok users have started to see a \"limited-time offer\" on their main feed to receive TikTok Shop credits to entice new users to sign up. For example, these people can earn about $50 for recruiting new members and $350 in bonuses for bringing in more, according to Bloomberg. Other ways to make money include checking into the app daily for a week and scrolling through a handful of TikTok Shop items, the report said.\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTikTok also continues to promote its TikTok Shop, where it sells products across fashion, beauty and home goods from both startups and well-known brands, including Crocs and Estee Lauder. In a press release, the company said the shop saw a 165% year-over-year increase in shoppers during Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend. On Black Friday, TikTok Shop hit $100 million in sales in one day -- three times as much as the previous Black Friday."

            "article_content": "Google reportedly wants the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to end Microsoft's exclusive cloud deal with OpenAI that requires anyone wanting access to OpenAI's models to go through Microsoft's servers.\n\nSomeone \"directly involved\" in Google's effort told The Information that Google's request came after the FTC began broadly probing how Microsoft's cloud computing business practices may be harming competition.\n\nAs part of the FTC's investigation, the agency apparently asked Microsoft's biggest rivals if the exclusive OpenAI deal was \"preventing them from competing in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market,\" multiple sources told The Information. Google reportedly was among those arguing that the deal harms competition by saddling rivals with extra costs and blocking them from hosting OpenAI's latest models themselves.\n\nIn 2024 alone, Microsoft generated about $1 billion from reselling OpenAI's large language models (LLMs), The Information reported, while rivals were stuck paying to train staff to move data to Microsoft servers if their customers wanted access to OpenAI technology. For one customer, Intuit, it cost millions monthly to access OpenAI models on Microsoft's servers, The Information reported.\n\nMicrosoft benefits from the arrangement\u2014which is not necessarily illegal\u2014of increased revenue from reselling LLMs and renting out more cloud servers. It also takes a 20 percent cut of OpenAI's revenue. Last year, OpenAI made approximately $3 billion selling its LLMs to customers like T-Mobile and Walmart, The Information reported.\n\nMicrosoft's agreement with OpenAI could be viewed as anti-competitive if businesses convince the FTC that the costs of switching to Microsoft's servers to access OpenAI technology is so burdensome that it's unfairly disadvantaging rivals. It could also be considered harming the market and hampering innovation by seemingly disincentivizing Microsoft from competing with OpenAI in the market.\n\nTo avoid any disruption to the deal, however, Microsoft could simply point to AI models sold by Google and Amazon as proof of \"robust competition,\" The Information noted. The FTC may not buy that defense, though, since rivals' AI models significantly fall behind OpenAI's models in sales. Any perception that the AI market is being foreclosed by an entrenched major player could trigger intense scrutiny as the US seeks to become a world leader in AI technology development."

Musk's ally and fellow PayPal Mafia member David Sacks was recently appointed as Trump's AI and crypto czar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Sacks was tapped for the position, OpenAI chief Sam Altman \u2014 with whom Musk has a long-running feud \u2014 took to X to congratulate him on the role. Musk responded with a laughing emoji.\n\nFriar's comments follow Altman's remarks at The New York Times' DealBook summit last week, in which he said he didn't think Musk would use his political power to his advantage and boost his own AI startup, xAI.\n\nHe said, \"I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power to the degree that Elon would hurt competitors and advantage his own businesses.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk has been embroiled in a legal battle with OpenAI since March after twice suing the company behind ChatGPT. He accused the company and some of its cofounders of violating its founding charter with its plans to change its corporate structure to become a for-profit business, and of putting commercial interests ahead of its original mission to benefit humanity.\n\nAltman also addressed the feud between him and Musk at the DealBook conference, calling it \"tremendously sad\" and said he grew up looking to Musk as a \"mega hero.\"\n\nxAI was launched just 16 months ago, but it has quickly scaled up to be considered a competitor of OpenAI. In record time, the $50 billion startup built a supercomputer in Memphis that has 100,00 GPUs and is aiming to increase that to at least one million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI and Elon Musk didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nFunMap has high functional relevance, deep proteome coverage and a scale-free, modular and small-world network topology. Credit: Nature Cancer (2024). DOI: 10.1038/s43018-024-00869-z\n\nLarge-scale protein and gene profiling have massively expanded the landscape of cancer-associated proteins and gene mutations, but it has been difficult to discern whether they play an active role in the disease or are innocent bystanders.\n\nIn a study published in Nature Cancer, researchers at Baylor College of Medicine revealed a powerful and unbiased machine learning-based approach called FunMap for assessing the role of cancer-associated mutations and understudied proteins, with broad implications for advancing cancer biology and informing therapeutic strategies.\n\n\"Gaining functional information on the genes and proteins associated with cancer is an important step toward better understanding the disease and identifying potential therapeutic targets,\" said corresponding author Dr. Bing Zhang, professor of molecular and human genetics and part of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor.\n\n\"Our approach to gain functional insights into these genes and proteins involved using machine learning to develop a network mapping their functional relationships,\" said Zhang, a member of Baylor's Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center and a McNair Scholar.\n\n\"It's like, I may not know anything about you, but if I know your LinkedIn connections, I can infer what you do.\"\n\nThe team developed FunMap, a functional network of 10,525 genes constructed using a supervised machine learning method that integrates protein datasets and RNA sequencing data from 11 cancer types recently harmonized by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) pan-cancer working group.\n\n\"With FunMap, we found 196,800 associations among 10,525 proteins\u2014a comprehensive and unbiased proteomic coverage and a high level of functional relevance,\" Zhang said.\n\n\"Two key differences between our approach and previous gene co-expression network studies are first, the integration of cancer protein data with mRNA expression data and second, the application of supervised machine learning to synergize all datasets to maximize the predictive power. Unexpectedly, our approach outperformed protein\u2013protein interaction networks in discriminating between functionally relevant and irrelevant gene pairs.\"\n\nThrough network analysis, FunMap uncovers protein modules and a hierarchical modular organization linked to cancer hallmarks and clinical characteristics, predicts the functions of understudied cancer proteins, offers deeper insights into established cancer drivers and identifies drivers with low mutation frequency.\n\n\"More than 200 genes are highly overexpressed or under-expressed in cancer, but we know very little about their specific roles in the disease,\" Zhang said. \"When we mapped these genes in our network, we were able to look at the neighborhood and make a prediction about their function.\"\n\nFor example, the expression of the understudied gene MAB21L4 is significantly below normal in three types of cancer tumors. FunMap showed that this gene's network neighborhood is enriched for genes associated with epithelial cell differentiation, the suppression of which plays a critical role in tumor progression.\n\nClinical tumor grading data, together with a recent study showing that loss of MAB21L4 blocks differentiation to drive the development of squamous cell carcinoma, provide strong evidence to support a tumor suppressor role of MAB21L4.\n\nMoreover, leveraging cutting edge deep learning methods with FunMap uncovered numerous previously unrecognized cancer drivers with low mutation frequencies, including a novel tumor suppressor role for LGI3, supported by gene knockout experimental data.\n\nThis study highlights the great potential of integrating machine learning and proteogenomic profiling to gain a deeper understanding of complex cancer systems. By generating a comprehensive functional network, this approach provides a robust framework for cancer functional genomics research, offering valuable insights into mutations and cancer-associated proteins.\n\n\"These findings can greatly aid in prioritizing targets for clinical translation, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective cancer therapies,\" Zhang said.\n\nMore information: Mapping the functional network of human cancer through machine learning and pan-cancer proteogenomics, Nature Cancer (2024).

            "article_content": "With the end of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria, the task of tallying the cost in human lives of a nearly 14-year-long civil war is continuing. Death toll estimates from the conflict are as high as 620,000, a staggering number in a country with a prewar population of 22 million.\n\nExperts say establishing the true scale of death is complicated, as estimates are drawn from different sources and methods and calculated in varying ways. Here\u2019s what we know:\n\nWhat is the latest death toll?\n\nAs of March, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had documented the names of 507,567 people who had died in Syria since the outbreak of the conflict in March 2011. The independent Syrian-run organization, which is based in Britain and collates information from multiple sources, said that it had verified another 110,343 deaths of people who were not named, bringing the total of civilians and combatants killed throughout the war to 617,910.\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights, another independent human rights organization that has been tracking the toll since the start of the conflict, had counted a total of 231,495 civilian deaths through June.\n\nWhat does the United Nations say?\n\nThe Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights last released an accounting in 2021, when it estimated that at least 580,000 people had been killed to that point, including 350,209 \u201cidentified individuals.\u201d The U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, cautioned at the time that the figure was \u201cnot a complete number of conflict-related killings\u201d but that it indicated a \u201cminimum verifiable number, and is certainly an undercount of the actual number.\u201d\n\nBefore 2021, the United Nations had not released a report on deaths in Syria since 2014 because it said conditions on the ground made accurate documentation impossible. However, when the war reached its 10th year, the organization responded to the need for updated information with a new report. By then, the war had shifted from large-scale military hostilities to regional clashes between multiple armed groups, making access and accuracy even more complicated, so the U.N. stopped reporting numbers.\n\nHow is the death toll calculated?\n\nThe U.N. and the Syrian human rights organizations say they rely on on-the-ground interviews, news reports and publicly available information such as death certificates and hospital records. They then identify and exclude duplicates and records with only partial information from the total and check the results against other statistical estimates.\n\nCases where people had been taken into government custody with no documentation \u2014 the forcibly disappeared \u2014 are not part of the total, nor are cases in which victims are killed and their bodies not recovered.\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights focuses on tallying civilian deaths. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also tracks deaths among the Syrian military, rebel factions, foreign militias and armed units sent by other governments that are party to the conflict, such as Israel, Russia and Iran.\n\nWill we ever know the final toll?\n\nThe end of the conflict will bring some clarity. When Damascus fell on Dec. 8, rebel groups opened Syria\u2019s prisons, freeing thousands of surviving detainees to the relief of friends and families. But thousands of other people remain missing.\n\nFadel Abdul Ghany, the founder of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, has counted more than 100,000 men, women and children who were \u201cforcibly disappeared\u201d by the Assad regime since 2011 and who were not included in any death toll. So far, he says, very few have emerged from the prisons, and he has been able to identify only about 3,000 death certificates.\n\nBased on what he has seen from the jails and the documents his team has obtained, Mr. Ghany estimated that at least 85,000 of those forcibly disappeared have been killed in al-Assad\u2019s detention centers."

            "article_content": "Russia is already at war with the west. It has been so since its occupation of Crimea in 2014, when Russia sought to secure its access to Sevastopol as a base for its Black Sea Fleet and as a potential lever of influence over Kyiv\u2019s political direction.\n\nEven in 2014 \u2013 at the annual Valdai security conference \u2013 Vladimir Putin was referencing an escalation towards conflict with the west. He later described the west as having \u201ccrossed a line\u201d.\n\nPutin signalled at the time that he was prepared to escalate further and threaten wider military conflict, but mostly the west ignored those messages. It\u2019s taken a long time for Nato and many western nations to realise their significance, and to understand that they are dealing with a continual escalation.\n\nToday Putin has five main reasons for being on a war footing and seeing Russia as in a conflict with the west. These are: the incremental enlargement of Nato and the EU towards Russian borders; western financial and military support for Ukraine to resist the 2022 full-scale invasion; anti-Russian rhetoric and international sanctions on Russian goods; measures to restrict Russian use of the international banking system; and, most recently, Ukraine\u2019s allies allowing the firing into Russia of long-range missiles\n\nThere have been plenty of indications of the Kremlin\u2019s mindset over the intervening years. For instance, in November 2022, Putin said: \u201cOur armed forces \u2026 are fighting on the line of contact that is over 1,000 kilometers long, fighting not only against neo-Nazi units but actually the entire military machine of the collective west\u201d.\n\nIn October 2023 Russian security council deputy chair, Dmitry Medvedev, described the supporters of Ukraine as \u201cactively pushing us towards World War III\u201d. In January 2024 Russia foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, described Russia as the liberator from a revived second world war axis, and suggested that it was tackling another rise in Nazism.\n\nRussia labels different kinds of confrontation according to geographical reach and intensity. At the lowest end of its scale is \u201carmed conflict\u201d. This happens within a single territorial area, such as Chechnya.\n\nOne notch above is a local war. In 2014 the initial movement of the unbadged \u201cgreen men\u201d (Russian soldiers) into Crimea was to maintain deniability but was clearly an act of war. So in many ways at this stage, Ukraine was a local war.\n\nA local war has limited military and political goals and usually takes place over a short period such as in the 2008 Russo-Georgian war, but can also involve repercussions for allies of the states at war. The next two levels of Russian war are regional wars and large-scale wars.\n\nIn regional wars several states work in coalition to secure strategically important military and political goals (such as the Soviet Union\u2019s military engagement in Afghanistan 1979-89, and the 1990-91 Gulf War, which did not involve Russia). It is likely that Russia has seen the Ukraine conflict as a regional war since 2022, with some elements of a large-scale war.\n\nLarge scale war not far off?\n\nHowever, the next level of war \u2013 the \u201clarge-scale war\u201d \u2013 may not be far off. These are wars between coalitions of states: for example, Ukraine and Nato against Russia, Iran, North Korea and China, or a wide number of countries in different parts of the world (such as the second world war). Large-scale wars create \u201cradical military political change\u201d, with intensified fighting and spread. These tend to involve a massive mobilisation of resources.\n\nThese coalitions are not yet in direct conflict with each other, but there has been large-scale mobilisation of weaponry and forces in Russia and Ukraine. North Korea has recently sent 10,000 troops to Russia.\n\nFor the west, large-scale war would significantly increase the risk of nuclear war, cause stock market volatility, cost significantly more money, and subject European citizens to the instability via a large number of physical and cyber attacks.\n\nEuropean policymakers and citizens need to understand more about key Russian aims (such as creating a buffer zone with the EU, or securing the lands it sees as Russian). In doing so, the public will know which politicians are \u2013 in effect \u2013 serving and opposing Putin\u2019s strategic agenda.\n\nRussia has strongly signalled that recent changes in US and British policy, in allowing their long range missiles to be fired into Russia, as escalatory. For example the secretary of the Russian security council, Sergei Shoigu, has said: \u201cWhen the situation \u2026 is not in favour of the Kyiv regime, the West is faced with a choice \u2013 to continue financing it and destroying the Ukrainian population or to recognise the current realities and start negotiating.\u201d\n\nRussia amended its nuclear doctrine in November and then proceeded to fire a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile into Ukraine, bringing it closer to direct conflict with Nato countries. The Russian response to these changes is driving the escalation. Meanwhile, Russian-linked sabotage and espionage operations continue across the globe.\n\nEurope starts to prepare\n\nBelatedly, the Europe and the US are starting to understand that Russia already sees itself at war with the west, even if limited currently.\n\nCountries closest to Russia, such as Sweden, Norway, Finland and Lithuania, have understood this most keenly. Politically, they have sought to align more closely with Nato and European military allies, to actively repel Russian interference. And it\u2019s worth noting that Russian military resources have been stretched by assisting Syria to tackle ongoing insurgent attacks.\n\nBut overall Europe has been fundamentally weakened by decades of under-investment in defence, its inability to coordinate defence and security policy and its over-reliance on the US as its security guarantee.\n\nThere is limited public willingness to spend more money on defence in Europe. The damage done to European politics by Russian political interference and the rise of pockets of far-right populist groups have also made collective European responses hard to muster.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBut it\u2019s important to remember that the EU is better resourced than Russia, with a stronger technology and innovation sector. The Ukrainians have also shown what can be achieved in drone warfare to hold back vastly superior Russian numbers and artillery fire.\n\nEurope needs to manufacture high-end innovations at scale, something it is capable of doing.\n\nDisrupting Russia\u2019s base of support will also be important. Taking steps to prevent military transfers from Iran, North Korea and China are crucial, as is disrupting the ability of the Russian military-industrial complex to function.\n\nOverall, increased understanding of Russian intentions, motivations and capabilities is vital in the west. This could help avoid further escalation into a large-scale war, or, at least, improve its ability to negotiate with Putin."

I think it'd be an economic disaster for us and the region,\" Biden said at the Brookings Institution in Washington, referring to a conservative blueprint for a second Trump administration.\n\nCoughing frequently because of a cold, Biden said US consumers would pay the price for the tariffs that Trump has vowed to slap on US neighbors Mexico and Canada and on Asia-Pacific rival China.\n\nTogether they are the three biggest US trading partners.\n\n\"I believe this approach is a major mistake,\" Biden added.\n\nAt a separate event Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Trump's tariffs could \"derail the progress that we've made on inflation, and have adverse consequences on growth.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe warned at the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit that sweeping tariffs could raise prices significantly for US consumers and pile pressure on companies which rely on imports.\n\n- Shadow president -\n\nThe White House touted Biden's speech as a \"major address on his economic legacy\" as the 82-year-old looks to the history books with fewer than six weeks left in office.\n\nBiden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race against Trump in July due to concerns about his age and passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump comfortably defeated at the November polls.\n\nTrump's inauguration is not until January 20, but he has already become something of a shadow president, making pronouncements on the economy and foreign policy and being feted by world leaders.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden has kept a relatively low profile, but he came out swinging in defense of his own record before an audience of economists.\n\nHe contrasted his \"middle-out, bottom-up economic playbook\" with what he called Trump's failed promise of \"trickle-down economics\" in which tax cuts for the wealthy are supposed to boost incomes.\n\nBiden also touted achievements including the US economy's recovery from the Covid pandemic and his huge investments in green technology and industry.\n\n\"President-elect Trump is receiving the strongest economy in modern history,\" said Biden.\n\nBut the departing president said he regretted not signing his name to Covid stimulus checks sent out to Americans, like Trump had done.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden ended his speech with a broader plea for US leadership in a troubled world, even as Trump has repeatedly signaled his intention to take a more isolationist stance.\n\n\"If we do not lead the world, what nation leads the world?\" he said.\n\ndk-bys/md"

By creating a shortlist of potential devices, you'll be ready to seize discounts when they appear.\n\nSignificant discounts are rare when shopping for a Mac, but third-party sellers often offer lower prices. For Windows PCs , there are numerous opportunities for discounts, especially on older models or less supply-constrained devices. Monitoring prices for a few months can help you spot the best available deals, allowing you to purchase when the price drops."

The PC-21s will serve as advanced fixed-wing training aircraft. The contract includes Pilatus supplying supporting equipment, including mission planning and debriefing systems, and training materials.\n\n\u201cThe PC-21 really is the ideal advanced trainer for the Air Force and we at SkyAlyne are excited to be deploying it as part of the FAcT program,\u201d said Harrison Ruess, SkyAlyne\u2019s head of communications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s state-of-the-art, it\u2019s utilized by several other militaries, and undoubtedly it\u2019s going to serve Canada well for many years to come.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year FAcT program contract was awarded to SkyAlyne in spring 2024 and is currently in a five-year transition period to become the sole pilot and aircrew training program for the RCAF, as the three current separate RCAF training programs conclude and their responsibilities are combined into FAcT. The FAcT program is overseen from a Joint Management Office at SkyAlyne\u2019s Ottawa headquarters, with three operational bases: Moose Jaw, SK, Southport, MB, and Winnipeg, MB.\n\nSkyAlyne was formed through a partnership between CAE and KF Aerospace, which in turn are SkyAlyne\u2019s major subcontractors.\n\nTracy Medve, board chair of SkyAlyne and president/CEO of KF Aerospace, said \u201cThe PC-21 is one of the world\u2019s most capable and reliable training aircraft, expertly built and supported by Pilatus. Its versatility allows it to serve in a dual role as both a general advanced live flying trainer and in advanced jet training, which provides Canada with excellent value and offers a unique advantage for the FAcT program. We\u2019re thrilled to partner with Pilatus to deliver this exceptional platform for Canada\u2019s next generation of aircrew training.\u201d\n\nThe 23 Grob aircraft were confirmed on Nov. 19. The Grob G 120TPs are an upgraded version of the Grob G 120As, which are currently in use by KF Aerospace and the RCAF for military pilot training. The TP variant features updated avionics, higher performance, and a more powerful turboprop engine.\n\n\u201cPart of the Future Aircrew Training program includes infrastructure construction for new facilities to support the new fleet of aircraft that are coming,\u201d explained Ruess. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re in the design phase of the infrastructure work, and working diligently on that, with construction activities aiming to begin in the next 12 to 18 months on the base at 15 Wing.\u201d"

Furthermore, with proprietary chips and drivers, Huawei is the only vendor in the industry capable of dynamically adjusting CPU frequency or entering hibernation mode based on service loads, thereby achieving low carbon emissions and energy savings.\n\nAdditionally, the report notes that Huawei's TCC solution enhances O&M through the use of various automation tools. By creating digital assistants and experts built on a foundation model, the solution reduces service handling time and workloads. The integration of digital twins facilitates cross-layer fault demarcation and automatic root cause analysis, enabling operators to quickly identify faults and alleviate O&M pressure. This results insecure, agile, and efficient network changes.\n\nBeing at a \"leading position\" in NFVI commercial deployments, Huawei not only \"plays a leadership role in standards organizations and industry forums\", such as ETSI, and open-source communities like OpenStack and K8s, but also significantly contributes to vendor interoperability testing, setting benchmarks for the global telecom industry's development, the report states."

            "article_content": "I believe in the separation of church and state as a Christian, not because I\u2019m against Christianity, but because I know the history of Christianity.\n\nIt is because I have studied all about the tremendous harm that is caused whenever the church crawls into bed with the empire. The crusades, inquisitions, genocides, slavery and subjugation of women, and persecution of people who don\u2019t believe the way \u201cthe church\u201d demands, all done in the name of \u201cpreserving our Christian faith.\u201d\n\nWhenever a government mandates Christianity, it ceases to be a matter of faith pursued by human free will, and therefore it ceases to have anything to do with Jesus and just becomes another tool to oppress people that are seen as \u201coutsiders\u201d by those in power.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI believe in the separation of church and state because of the teachings of Jesus. One of them being, \u201cdo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d\n\nSo if I wouldn\u2019t want another religious group mandating my civic life, legislating their scriptures to be read in our public schools to my children or posting the commands from their god on public spaces, then I wouldn\u2019t want that done with my religion either to people from other religious and nonreligious backgrounds.\n\nI believe in the separation of church and state because there are numerous Christian sects within our country alone, let alone within the entire world. Each sect has their own unique theology and interpretation of the Bible. So which Christian sect gets to dictate the kind of Christianity that is mandated?\n\nAs a Protestant, I don\u2019t want my civic life to be mandated by Catholics, nor would Catholics want their civic life mandated by Protestants. We\u2019ve seen the horrors of that fight already in the conflicts since the Protestant reformation.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a Christian in the Wesleyan tradition, I don\u2019t want my civic life mandated by Calvinist Christians or Baptists or Fundamentalists. As I am sure they wouldn\u2019t want their civic life dictated by Wesleyan Christians either.\n\nJust imagine if Amish Christianity was mandated over all civic life. How would you feel about a \u201cChristian nation\u201d that made sure you couldn\u2019t use your car or any modern technology? Now apply that same logic to certain Christian sects dictating public education or the decisions people can make regarding their own healthcare.\n\nHistory has shown us that mandating one form of Christianity through the government leads to oppressing all outsiders, which even includes faithful Christians from other traditions as well.\n\nThat is another part of Christian history we often forget. Before the United States was founded, many fled here from a \u201cChristian nation,\u201d which was Britain, which was mandating one form of Christianity over everyone else. Repeating that here would be to not only ignore the reasons why many people came here in the first place, but it would just show the world that we refuse to learn from our mistakes in the past and repent from them.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an American and a believer in the First Amendment, I believe everyone should be free to live according to their own beliefs and not be mandated by the government to live according to a set of beliefs from a single religious group. Including my own. Only a government that is free from religious control can guarantee religious freedom for all.\n\nThis is why I believe in the separation of church and state and I am staunchly opposed to Christian Nationalism, which is both un-American and un-Christian. Not only does it violate religious freedom, but Jesus called us to love our neighbors as ourselves, which I believe includes not shoving our religion down their throats and dictating their life decisions by mandate of law. That is simply not loving at all.\n\nThis is why I believe it is a bankrupt Christianity that insists on legislating its beliefs over everyone else. It is a hypocritical Christianity that demands things like everyone be subjected to Bible readings and the Ten Commandments in our public schools, yet would claim to be \u201cpersecuted\u201d if another religion did those exact same things.\n\nI deeply believe that when we Christians arrive at the point of needing our beliefs mandated by the government, it is because we have ultimately concluded that the truth of the message we claim to have from Jesus no longer has the power to stand on its own merit, so we need the government to do it for us instead. It declares to the world that we don\u2019t actually believe in the power of our beliefs at all. It declares to the world that the church has failed to be the church on its own, failing to rely on the power of God, and therefore needs the government to intervene.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFar too many people in our society have witnessed a kind of Christianity that insists its particular beliefs need to be legislated over others, yet opposes legislation that would help hungry students be fed in schools, bring increased wages for people working to take care of their families, paid family leave, affordable childcare, healthcare for all, teachers being paid well, curbing gun violence, funding the education system better and supporting it rather than vilifying it and constantly attacking it, or caring for our planet, and the list goes on and on.\n\nIs this the kind of selfish and callous reputation we want as Christians? Where we see the government as a tool only to mandate our particular beliefs instead of seeing it as an opportunity to work together towards a society where all people are free, don\u2019t have to struggle to just have their basic needs met and can live flourishing lives?\n\nIs that the kind of legacy we want to leave behind? Are we really that fearful of other beliefs stamping out the gospel of Jesus that we have to resort to government mandates and using taxpayer dollars to legislate our beliefs? Isn\u2019t that just functioning out of fear rather than faith?\n\nI encourage anyone who is unsure about this topic to go study church history for themselves. You can begin with the Holy Roman Empire and the Doctrine of Discovery. Or even more recently the British Empire and Christian imperialism and colonialism. We have tried having nations run by a Christian sect far too many times before and we must learn from those examples or we will repeat them.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nI encourage all Christians to consider how we might be destroying the very gospel we claim to hold so dear by wanting it mandated over others rather than living it out ourselves. Because mandating our beliefs by force of law against people\u2019s free will is one of the most effective ways of causing people to reject the God we claim to believe in with all their heart, soul, mind and strength.\n\nI believe in the separation of church and state because it not only allows the church to be the church and the state to be the state, but it also prevents the church from giving into the temptation to worship political power and allows it to faithfully embody the gospel of Jesus, including speaking truth to the powers of this world. The church simply can\u2019t speak truth to the power of the state when it has become one with the power of the state.\n\nJesus rejected Satan\u2019s temptation to control the kingdoms of this world and I believe we as his followers should too.\n\n\u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d - Jesus\n\nBenjamin Cremer is a husband, father, pastor, theologian, writer and lifelong Idahoan.

Rodgers debuted the conspiracy, which has to do with apparent drones that have been flying over New Jersey, on The Pat McAfee Show earlier this week.\n\nAs Aaron Rodgers was discussing the drone sightings that have happened recently in New Jersey and Staten Island, Rodgers and the geniuses over at The Pat McAfee Show speculated that it could be aliens in the drones, which led the four-time NFL MVP down a tangent about wanting to have a \u201c5E experience\u201d with the aliens.\n\nThe five \u201cE\u2019s\u201d in the 5-E experience model stand for \u201cExcitement, Entry, Engagement, Exit, Extension.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about having a Friday night 5E experience.\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cIt\u2019s where you have a big kind of meditation circle and then you call in the aliens and you use little green lasers to bring them in.\u201d\n\nAs for the drones, Rodgers says there\u2019s been some \u201ccrazy stuff\u201d happening and could barely contain his grin while doing so.\n\n\u201cDo you know what\u2019s been going on in New Jersey lately? And I\u2019m not talking about the football. There\u2019s been some crazy things going on,\u201d Rodgers said as Pat McAfee\u2019s production team cued up a video of the alleged drones. McAfee suggested it was a helicopter while co-host and perpetual floating head AJ Hawk said it was an airplane.\n\n\u201cHere we go. Look at this, cued up. What the hell is that? \u2026 That\u2019s large. What is that? \u2026 I\u2019ve seen that video.

            "article_content": "We have only one example of biology forming in the universe \u2014 life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don\u2019t know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI\u2019m an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I\u2019ve learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there\u2019s advanced alien life out there, I\u2019m on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nWhat Is Life And How Can We Detect It?\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2013 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it\u2019s a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don\u2019t agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \u201cself-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\u201d That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet\u2019s atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA\u2019s definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and Complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2013 biological or not \u2013 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nMinerals are an example of a nonliving system that has increased in diversity and complexity over billions of years. Doug Bowman, CC BY\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism\u2019s genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nThe search for extraterrestrial life starts here\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide, and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life\u2019s essential molecules \u2013 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they\u2019re unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they\u2019ll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth\u2019s crust. However, other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth, and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy for finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how and when the first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that\u2019s for life as we know it \u2013 for life as we don\u2019t know it, all bets are off.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation by Chris Impey at University of Arizona.

            "article_content": "Astronomers have discovered another mysterious and massive circle of radio light in space. The strange and vast circle of light is an example of an ORC (Odd Radio Circle), the origins of which are currently unknown.\n\nORCS, first discovered in 2019, are so vast they can be 10 times the width of the Milky Way, thus encompassing entire galaxies.\n\nThe newly found ORC, designated ORC J0219\u20130505, was discovered in data from the MIGHTEE survey conducted by the MeerKAT radio telescope located in the Meerkat National Park in the Northern Cape of South Africa. The 371,600 light-year-wide ORC seems to be associated with the elliptical galaxy WISEA J021912.43\u2013050501.8. It has features that seem to set it apart from other ORCs, including the fact that it appears fainter and that details of its structure reveal it leans to one side.\n\n\"Odd Radio Circles: Circles of radio emission found around distant galaxies that we still don't understand,\" lead researcher and Western Sydney University astronomer Ray Norris told Space.com. \"It's a completely unexpected discovery, not predicted by the physics we already know, and therefore revealing a gap in our knowledge.\n\n\"So we hope these will tell us something new about how galaxies form and interact.\"\n\nAs mentioned above, ORC J0219\u20130505 seems to differ from other previously discovered ORCs, which has at least answered one question about this strange astronomical phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\"All the ORCS we had previously discovered were very similar. We weren't sure whether this was because all ORCS really are similar or whether it was a selection bias in our detection methods,\" Norris said. \"This new ORC tells us it was indeed a selection effect.\"\n\nThe astronomer added that the faintness of this ORC is consistent with ORCS coming in a range of sizes and brightnesses. He compares this to the variations seen in radio galaxies, which have giant radio emission regions that extend well beyond their visible structure.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

The debate around ORCs concerns the source of these powerful shockwaves.\n\n\"There are two main schools of thought as to what causes this,\" Norris explained. \"One is that the circles of ORCs are caused by spheres of shocked gas surrounding a galaxy.\"\n\nThe astronomer said that in this case, the ring we see representing an ORC is actually just the cross-section of an expanding sphere caused by a shock wave.\n\nThis shock wave could be the result of a cosmic collision, either two galaxies colliding and merging or even two supermassive black holes merging.\n\nTwo supermassive black holes collide and merge. Is this the source of the shockwaves that create ORCs? (Image credit: NASA)\n\nAlternatively, Norris said that the rings could be caused by a plane shock wave from another source crossing a dead radio lobe from a supermassive black hole.\n\n\n\nThese lobes emerge from each side of feeding supermassive black holes and spread out to incredible distances.\n\nIn this case, Norris said that as the plane shock wave intersects the roughly spherical outer edge of the remnant lobe, it creates a ring of accelerated electrons that generate synchrotron radiation.\n\nThis multiwavelength image of the Cloverleaf ORC (odd radio circle) (Image credit: X. Zhang and M. Kluge (MPE), B. Koribalski (CSIRO))\n\nThe fact that ORC J0219\u20130505 differs from previously discovered ORCs could hint at which of these creation models is the accurate one.\n\n\"The offset between the center of the ring and the host galaxy isn\u2019t easy to explain in the merging supermassive black hole model,\" Norris explained. \"That was my favorite model, so I\u2019m not very happy about this!\"\n\nNorris pointed out that the discovery of ORC J0219\u20130505 shows there is \"still a fair way to go\" before scientists understand ORCs.\n\nThe astronomer said that in addition to investigating WISEA J021912.43\u2013050501.8, this ORC's galactic home, further with a large optical telescope, the team will also hunt for more ORCs as they attempt to solve this cosmic curiosity.\n\nThe team's research is reported in preprint form on the repository site arXiv."

            "article_content": "In November 1924, French physicist Louis de Broglie presented his revolutionary theory that has become one of the cornerstones of quantum physics.\n\nFive years after presenting his revolutionary theory, in 1929, Louis de Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking contribution, which remains fundamental to modern quantum mechanics and its numerous applications.\n\nThibault Damour, an Emeritus Professor of Physics at the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques (IHES), explained the profound impact of de Broglie\u2019s work, describing it as a generalization of Albert Einstein\u2019s earlier insights into the dual nature of light.\n\nEinstein had associated particle-like properties with the wave-like nature of light, while de Broglie\u2019s breakthrough involved the reverse: associating wave-like properties with matter.\n\n\u201cDe Broglie made the reverse discovery of Einstein by associating waves to matter,\u201d Damour said.\n\nThis groundbreaking idea marked a crucial step in the evolution of quantum mechanics. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, inspired by de Broglie\u2019s hypothesis through Einstein, later developed the famous Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which describes the propagation of matter waves.\n\nThis Schr\u00f6dinger-de Broglie equation is now recognized as one of the foundational equations of quantum mechanics, underpinning countless scientific advancements and practical technologies.\n\nDamour further highlighted the widespread applications of de Broglie\u2019s theory. The concept of wave-like properties in matter has been instrumental in the development of solid-state physics.\n\n\n\nRead more on RFI English\n\n\n\nRead also:\n\nFran\u00e7ois Arago: The scientist and statesman who shaped science and society\n\nTangled future of quantum computing explained by French Nobel winner\n\nFrom The Lab: Building quantum computing systems, one photon at a time"

            "article_content": "Most of us are aware of the deep problems in the current US pharmaceutical industry. Yet few may realize that today\u2019s issues stem from changes that occurred centuries ago.\n\nAs I explain in The Apothecary\u2019s Wife: The Hidden History of Medicine and How it Became a Commodity, the current medication system was established between 1650 and 1740, when professionals used the scientific revolution to push women out of the medical space. At that time, domestic medicine was dominant. Women were the primary sources of medicine in their communities, making medication from organic ingredients at home. Despite using the exact same ingredients for their own medicines, apothecaries and physicians persuaded the public of the superiority of their treatments and began charging for them. Medicinal substances transformed from free, household goods for everyone into commodities available only to those with means. This transformation normalized the practice of withholding life-saving medications from people who could not afford it \u2014 and valuing the economic success of corporations over the lives of some citizens.\n\nThe forces that transformed medication into a commodity are still with us. For example, domestic medicine encouraged sharing recipes to maximize healing, but today\u2019s commercial medicine attempts to keep recipes secret to maximize profit. The US patent system and the battles between corporations making generic and brand-name drugs is a logical result, even when those mechanisms imperil patients\u2019 health and lives. (See also Victor Roy\u2019s Capitalizing a Cure: How Finance Controls the Price and Value of Medicines.)\n\nRegulation is another legacy of medication\u2019s economic transformation. In an attempt to exclude quacks from the medical marketplace and to protect consumers, 17th- and 18th-century professionals began testing competitors\u2019 medicines to prove their inferiority and then publicizing the results. Joshua Ward (ca. 1685-1761), for instance, widely sold \u201cmedications\u201d made of metals such as lead and antimony despite knowing that ingesting them could be fatal (Chapter 7 in The Apothecary\u2019s Wife has a lot to say about him). Regulatory entities such as the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency should do this work now. History provides ample proof that when guided by science, regulation works. It has also shown us that lax oversight, such as in the famous case of thalidomide, the furor over aduhelm, and today\u2019s generic drug industry, endangers patients.\n\nWe also continue to experience the fallout from the campaign to elevate \u201cthe New Science.\u201d Its 17- and 18-century advocates made it seem more impressive by casting this new way of thinking and discovering as too difficult for ordinary people. That strategy generated an ongoing suspicion of science and a profound misunderstanding of how science functions. Although particularly virulent in the United States, this skepticism and ignorance of science abounds worldwide.\n\nFor the United States, this legacy will be even more obvious and determinative after the new government is sworn in on January 20, 2025. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) is America\u2019s only attempt so far at a public health system. For decades, the Republican party on the whole has been opposed to the ACA and national health care more broadly, drawing on the value system that displaced domestic medicine\u2019s ethos with one that prioritizes corporate health over human health. 17- and 18-century professionals recognized this issue in converting medication into a commodity, but decided against adding a mechanism for treating the impoverished. Repealing the ACA would be returning to the three-hundred-year-old roots of today\u2019s system. Similarly, the current nominee to lead the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Mehmet Oz, has pursued profit opportunities in medicine with disregard for science and the health of ordinary people. He has even promoted colloidal silver (more upscale than Joshua Ward, but an equally ancient claim). It is likely that the provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requiring the CMS to negotiate the prices that it pays for pharmaceuticals will be ignored or removed.\n\nSkepticism and suspicion of science undoubtedly will bear down on federal divisions, departments, and institutes responsible for health care and science. Regulation is a probable early casualty. The nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., harbors these views, exemplified by his opposition to vaccines, fluoridated water, and pasteurized milk. Kennedy\u2019s misunderstanding of how science works, not to mention the role of regulation, leads to a hostility toward scientists that has much in common with witchcraft fears. History suggests that under such leadership, HHS and the CMS will authorize the use of unscientifically tested treatments, reject the scientific foundations of the regulation process, and nurture a national hostility to science and scientists.\n\nThe consequences of this approach will appear quickly. Federal opposition to vaccines, for instance, will swiftly raise the mortality rate, especially the infant and child mortality rates, to spectacular highs. As Olivia Craighead drily wrote after Mehmet Oz\u2019s nomination, \u201cFingers crossed colloidal silver works for measles.\u201d Outbreaks of easily prevented, highly communicable, frequently fatal or permanently debilitating diseases such as measles and pertussis (whooping cough) will likely negatively impact the economy. Tourism will drop as visitors choose to avoid such a perilous environment. The national failure to provide a reliably healthy, sound workforce will curtail domestic productivity and obstruct foreign investment.\n\nPrognostication in this case is fairly easy. Addressing these values and beliefs about the role of medication is not. They are rooted in medication\u2019s transformation into a commodity. Knowing where these ideas came from, however, offers insight into the current system, and as history shows, insight is a step toward action."
