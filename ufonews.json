        "article_content": "I love diving into gaming history, playing old games and keeping those experiences in my mind for when I play new ones. There\u2019s a whole new world of insight you can access when you come into something armed with context of what came before. Even in my short time at Shacknews I\u2019ve pushed things like preservation because capturing, holding onto, and sharing knowledge feels like an important and underserved piece of criticism in games. UFO 50, a collection of retro-styled games from Mossmouth, feels as much like validation for those principles as it does a new, original work. It\u2019s a fictional portfolio from a long-lost video game studio that celebrates not just games themselves, but the value of going back and unearthing art from the past to both enjoy it and learn from it.\n\nReal games, fictional context\n\nSource: Mossmouth\n\nUFO 50 doesn\u2019t narrate its story to you, but there\u2019s still a compelling framing device that bleeds into the game\u2019s nuts and bolts. You\u2019re playing a set of 50 games developed by UFO Soft, a company that developed and published games on its series of LX consoles. The games were made throughout the 1980s, and you literally wipe the dust off each cartridge when you play them for the first time. In the main menu each title has a little synopsis, as well as a sentence or two adding some kind of additional historical context. Perhaps it\u2019s an anecdote about a game\u2019s inspiration, such as from a poster in the studio\u2019s bathroom. Other times you\u2019ll get something like how Night Manor, a point and click-style horror game, was UFO Soft\u2019s only game featuring required warning text.\n\nDespite only being a few paragraphs of text in total, there\u2019s a real sense of UFO Soft being a real company that existed in UFO 50\u2019s imagined world. You can feel the vibe that this was a small group in an era when games could be pumped out based on singular ideas, then iterated on in further sequels and other new projects, enough to sustain a company and build not just a library, but an identity. Each little snippet of context feels like reading through old gaming magazines and building a picture in your mind of what it may have looked like to work in gaming in the 1980s.\n\nA complex collection\n\nSource: Mossmouth\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s deliberate or not, considering how in interviews the folks behind this game didn\u2019t initially view this project as a single package. But the ways in which the games in UFO 50 follow a sort of evolutionary path is fascinating. If you play each game in order you can map out the trajectory in your mind, especially when you come across sequels and spinoffs of what seem to be UFO Soft\u2019s core IPs. It\u2019s actually wild to think about how the real-life developers plotted out the fictional devs\u2019 progress and laid it out across these titles, rather than simply making each individual game as \u201ccomplete\u201d with all the lessons we\u2019ve collectively learned as devs and gamers in 2024. You\u2019ll see an idea introduced in a game early in the list, then grow and improve over time as you move through the years until there are games towards the end that feel like several ideas and learned lessons culminating into bigger, more elaborate productions.\n\nThat being said, not every game on this list is going to be a certified banger for every player. There\u2019s a wide selection of genre, as well as complexity and that mythical force we refer to in shorthand as \u201cpolish.\u201d There are games here I booted up, played for a couple minutes, and moved on from. I probably won\u2019t play Bug Hunter ever again, for example. But there are other games like Grimstone, a full-by-god wild west JRPG, that I will absolutely go back to and see all the way to the end. It almost feels like I\u2019ve gone back to my formative years playing around with emulators and huge ROM lists, going through and finding what resonated with me while taking in little pieces of everything. Fist Hell felt like a bad version of River City Ransom, while Valbrace is a strange hybrid of Wizardry and Punch-Out that feels like nothing I\u2019ve ever played before. It\u2019s an eclectic mix, and each individual piece contributes to the overall bigger picture of UFO Soft as an entity.\n\nIt's also worth noting that as fun as these games can be, there's a sort of line being toed between authenticity and approachability. A lot of the games in the collection are tough even by the standards of their era, mostly because a lot of them give you one life and no continues. If you die, you simply start right back at the beginning. Other games that are more substantive may offer multiple lives or chances, but it's still a harsh Game Over when you use them up. Features like rewind or unlimited continues may clash with the idea that you're literally cleaning up and playing old cartridges in the narrative, but some kind of compromise would have made trying to really dive into and complete each game a more appealing venture. To UFO 50's credit, the longer games (especially the RPGs) do have auto-saving and checkpoint systems. But having auto-save kind of invalidates the earlier remark about authenticity, so there's a little inconsistency there anyway.\n\nSource: Mossmouth\n\nUFO 50 is like stumbling across a time capsule and discovering a wealth of lost knowledge inside. And yet, it\u2019s entirely a singular work of fiction. That by itself is deeply fascinating and makes this thing worth playing. Even if you pass over most of the games and only find a few that stick with you from a fun perspective, the depth on a conceptual level is absurd and gratifying to simply think about. We\u2019re living at a time in which older games are vanishing from both physical reality and our sort of collective cultural well at an increasing rate, when remakes are seen as replacements for original work and curiosity to seek out history is dwindling unless there\u2019s a purchasable remaster. UFO 50 is fun to play and take at face value, but it also highlights how age really isn\u2019t a detriment to having a great time and engaging with games.\n\nUFO 50 is available now for PC. The game was purchased by Shacknews for this review."

        "article_content": "With 8 Silent Hill 2 Remake endings to get through, those who are out to find them all have a lot to work through, as 5 of the 8 endings can only be unlocked on New Game Plus. Not only that, the choices that impact which ending you get are sometimes made throughout the whole game, not just in the last moments of the Silent Hill 2 Remake, meaning that you can't necessarily reload a save and just choose a different outcome - there have been hours of choices or secret items leading up to this moment.\n\n\n\nWith that in mind, it's very important that players understand the steps necessary to unlock the endings in Silent Hill 2 Remake - that way you can pick which one you want and aim for it early on, using all the steps in our spoiler-free guide and walkthrough.\n\nAll Endings in Silent Hill 2 Remake\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThere are 8 possible endings to the Silent Hill 2 Remake, all of which we've laid out below, as well as whether you'll be able to unlock them on New Game Plus or your first playthrough.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Ending Requires New Game Plus? Leave No In Water No Maria No Rebirth Yes Dog Yes UFO Yes Bliss (new to Remake) Yes Stillness (new to Remake) Yes\n\nAs mentioned, the last two of these - \"Bliss\" and \"Stillness\" - are unique additions to the Remake, and did not appear in the original game. However, all the others are recreations of possible endings in the 2001 version.\n\n\n\nThe first time around, you'll be able to complete the game and get any of the first three endings - Leave, In Water or Maria - while in subsequent playthroughs of New Game Plus, you'll have the option to unlock all eight of them, including the first three. Below, we'll go through the requirements to unlock them all, without spoiling what those endings actually include.\n\nHow do the endings in Silent Hill 2 Remake work?\n\nIt's worth explaining that many of the endings in Silent Hill 2 work on a behind-the-scenes points system, or at least something similar to that idea. The Remake is constantly judging your actions in-game, with the idea being that the game is trying to work out how James is feeling about himself and the situation based on the actions you make him take, both in and out of combat. Some endings are based on him caring about the people he meets (or not), whereas others are based on how much he works to defend himself physically or how much self-preservation he exhibits.\n\nIt can be pretty hard to read and is always a little esoteric, but we'll lay out the basic steps that are being measured, and what they contribute to, below.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Leave ending\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe \"Leave\" ending in Silent Hill 2 is achieved by completing the game normally (it does not have to be NG+), under the following conditions.\n\nHeal frequently throughout the game so James spends as little time as possible injured.\n\nDo not examine Angela's Knife, or Mary's Photo, Letter or Handkerchief in your inventory.\n\nDo not visit Maria at the Hospital 2F bed, or the Labyrinth prison cell.\n\nIn the Silent Hill 2 Remake coin cabinet puzzle, pick the \"Snake\" coin at the end when asked to choose who's responsible.\n\nIn the corridor at the end of the game where you can hear Mary speaking, make sure you listen to the whole thing before moving to the next area.\n\nDon't go out of your way to protect Maria from threats or stay close to her when she's following you.\n\nThe goal here is to meet two criteria: have James show a high level of self-preservation, while also seeming uninterested in focusing on either Maria or Mary. Healing frequently is the easiest way to ensure this - don't spend a lot of time in low health, and you should be fine, even if you break some of the other rules.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake In Water ending\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe \"In Water\" ending in Silent Hill 2 is achieved by completing the game normally (it does not have to be NG+), under the following conditions.\n\nHeal yourself rarely throughout the game so James spends as much time as possible at low health.\n\nExamine Angela's Knife, Mary's Photo, Letter and Handkerchief in your inventory multiple times across the course of the game.\n\nDo not visit Maria at the Hospital 2F bed, or the Labyrinth prison cell.\n\nAt the Coin Cabinet, pick the \"Man\" coin at the end when asked to choose who's responsible.\n\nIn the corridor at the end of the game where you can hear Mary speaking, make sure you listen to the whole thing before moving to the next area.\n\nDon't go out of your way to protect Maria from threats or stay close to her when she's following you.\n\nThis time around, you need to complete the game while showing James as somebody with low self-preservation and self-regard, while also focusing on Mary - but NOT Maria.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Maria ending\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe \"Maria\" ending in Silent Hill 2 is achieved by completing the game normally (it does not have to be NG+), under the following conditions.\n\nHeal frequently throughout the game so James spends as little time as possible injured.\n\nDo not examine Angela's Knife, or Mary's Photo, Letter or Handkerchief in your inventory.\n\nYou SHOULD visit Maria at the Hospital 2F bed, and the Labyrinth prison cell, multiple times each time. (Make sure you visit her in the hospital after locating the Marked Bracelet, and in the Labyrinth even after something bad happens to her).\n\nAt the Coin Cabinet, pick the \"Woman\" coin at the end when asked to choose who's responsible.\n\nIn the corridor at the end of the game where you can hear Mary speaking, DO NOT listen to the whole thing before moving to the next area.\n\nPrevent Maria from taking damage wherever possible.\n\nDo not make Maria uncomfortable by physically bumping into her, breaking a lot of glass around her, or being separated from her for long periods of time.\n\nAfter meeting her in Rosewood Park, follow her obediently and DO NOT deviate from the pathways she suggests until you reach the hospital (this means don't go looking for the Silent Hill 2 Remake Garage Jack lever).\n\nThe goal here is to show high self-preservation (James wants to live), while also making Maria look like a high priority, but not Mary. This is probably the trickiest of the three \"first playthrough\" endings to achieve, as keeping Maria safe and happy is pretty fiddly, especially when something as minor as bumping into her can have a negative effect.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Rebirth ending\n\nThe Rebirth ending can only be achieved on New Game Plus, and rather than something you do through choices, this time you have to find four special items to add to your inventory throughout the game.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe Crimson Ceremony is found in the cemetery where you first meet Angela, on a grave by the lakeside.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe White Chrism is on a table outside of Baldwin Mansion after you first solve the Silent Hill 2 Remake motel safe code puzzle with Maria.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe Obsidian Goblet is inside the Historical Society you enter after the hospital, inside an alcove on the wall.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe Lost Memories book is in the \"Lost and Found\" on 1F of LakeView Hotel. Breaking a wall in the cafe will allow you to access this.\n\nOnce you have all these four items, completing the main story will automatically trigger the \"Rebirth\" ending, regardless of what choices or actions you've made along the way. This can only be cancelled by triggering the specific conditions for the endings that are listed after this one.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Dog ending\n\nThe legendary \"Dog\" ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake is also specific to New Game Plus, and is unlocked through the following means:\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nFind the Broken Key Part 1. This is on top of a desk in the backroom of the Pet Center in the South Vale, which you can explore while fixing the Silent Hill 2 Remake jukebox.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nFind the Broken Key Part 2. After going through the locked gate in the Motel with Maria, turn right three times to find a doghouse in a dead-end path. The second key part is there.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nCombine both key parts in your inventory to make the Dog Key, then use it to open the Observation Room on 3F of the Lakeview Hotel. This will trigger the Dog Ending.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake UFO ending\n\nAnother ending specific to NG+, the UFO ending in the Silent Hill 2 Remake is achieved through the following method:\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nGet the Blue Gem. This is in the window of a jewellery store North of Big Jay's when you're doing the Jukebox repair. Just crack the glass of the store to take the gem. \"Investigate\" the Blue Gem in your inventory at the following locations throughout the game (there'll be a symbol on an eye drawn somewhere nearby to mark you're in the right spot):\n\nThe Rooftop of Saul Street Apartments (while fixing the Jukebox)\n\nThe Pier to the Northwest of Rosewood Park after meeting Maria.\n\nThe dock at the South of LakeView Gardens you moor at after rowing over the lake.\n\nRoom 312 of LakeView Hotel, before you watch the Video tape.Empty list\n\nFulfil all these criteria and the last time you investigate the Blue Gem, in room 312, it should immediately trigger the UFO ending.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Bliss ending\n\nA new ending created specifically for the Remake, the \"Bliss\" ending is also specific to NG+. Here's how you get it:\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nIn the Northwest corner of the 1F Hospital Garden, while solving the puzzle of the Silent Hill 2 Remake Director's Office hand, you'll find a Small Chest if you crawl through a hole.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nIn Pete's Bowl-O-Rama, just South of the Historical Society after the Hospital, there's a safe you can open with the code 1887 to get the Rusted Key. Combine the Key and Chest in your inventory to get the White Claudia. Progress through the game until you reach room 312 of the Hotel. Select the White Claudia from your inventory to drink it. Watch the video tape, and this time you'll get an alternate ending.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Stillness ending\n\nThe last ending, \"Stillness\" is another of the two new finales concocted specifically for the Remake of Silent Hill 2, and specific to NG+. Here's how you get it.\n\nGet the Chainsaw at the very beginning of NG+ (our guide to the Silent Hill 2 Remake weapons will show you how).\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nAfter leaving the Ranch, smash the window of the green car on Wiltse Road to get the Key of Sorrow.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nLater in the game, after watching the video in Room 312, go to the Manager's Officer on 1F and use the key (and the code 314) to open the safe and get the Toluca Postcard. Inspect the postcard in your inventory at least once. Complete the rest of the game to get the Stillness ending.\n\nWhat is the Silent Hill 2 Remake best ending?\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nWarning: this section of the guide has spoilers for the plot of Silent Hill 2 Remake.\n\nThe Silent Hill 2 Remake has no best ending as we understand it, it's largely a matter of opinion, and harder to break up into black and white \"good/bad\" binaries. Still, some endings do seem darker than others: the \"Maria\" ending has James not only still ignoring the worst elements of what he did to Mary, it implies the awful events may repeat themselves, with Maria coughing on the way back to the car and James telling her to get that sorted in an ominous tone of voice.\n\n\n\nThe best ending is largely a matter of opinion - and what ultimate fate you think James deserves for what he did. Discarding the comedic UFO and Dog endings, in some finales he lets go of his guilt, but in those he can't, James ends up either destroying himself or potentially going down bleak paths (such as the occult resurrection in the \"Rebirth\" ending). There is no truly clean ending to a game as complex as Silent Hill 2 - and there probably shouldn't be.\n\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+. Not to be reproduced without permission"

        "article_content": "India's AI Advantage: Building Applications on LLMs\n\nShare on:\n\nBy Rediff Money Desk, New Delhi Oct 16, 2024 12:22\n\nIndia emerges as a global AI hub, leveraging engineering talent and vast data to build innovative applications on top of LLMs, transforming industries like SaaS and IT services.\n\nIllustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com\n\nNew Delhi, Oct 16 (PTI) In 2023, the world's early AI applications and large language models (LLMs) emerged primarily from the Bay Area, driven by highly specialised PhDs in deep learning. India then lagged in terms of access to these expert resources. A year later, the India story has changed dramatically.\n\n\n\nThe year 2024 will go down as a turning point with engineers in India beginning to develop innovative AI applications across various verticals, without needing deep learning PhDs. The number of AI startups building solutions on top of LLMs has since surged significantly.\n\n\n\n\u0093India is rapidly becoming a global hub for AI applications,\u0094 says Shekhar Kirani, a partner at global venture capital firm Accel.\n\n\n\nHe points to specific examples that demonstrate India's unique advantage in AI. A Bengaluru-based engineering team, for instance, built an AI application that automates 10-Q filings for US companies. Traditionally handled by accounting firms, the process took several days. However, the team trained a deep-learning model on top of open-source LLMs, reducing the time needed to generate these filings to under an hour.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kirani, India's vast services sector\u0097encompassing call centres, accounting, healthcare management, IT, and document processing\u0097offers access to a rich dataset for training AI models. \u0093India is a goldmine for trainable data, and our engineers are perfectly positioned to build industry-specific AI applications.\u0094\n\n\n\nLEVERAGING PROPRIETARY DATA FOR AI INNOVATION\n\n\n\nA standout example of India's growing expertise in AI is CareStack, a dental practice management software company in Accel's portfolio.\n\n\n\nCareStack's engineers in Kerala developed an AI application that records voice annotations from dentists and automates data entry into patient management systems. This solution, built on OpenAI's LLM, was made possible because the company had amassed a large dataset of voice samples from its dentist customers.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Zenoti, another Accel-backed company, developed an AI-powered front-office management system for spas and salons. The AI agent handles appointment scheduling, cancellations, and customer queries in real-time. These examples, says Kirani, illustrate how Indian companies are combining proprietary datasets with existing LLMs to create solutions that are transforming industries.\n\n\n\nINDIA'S EDGE IN BUILDING AI APPLICATIONS ON LLMS\n\n\n\nIn Kirani's view, India's combination of engineering talent, industry expertise, and access to trainable data gives the country a clear advantage in building AI applications on top of LLMs.\n\n\n\n\u0093We are seeing small, young teams\u0097engineers just three years out of college\u0097creating phenomenal AI applications,\u0094 he explains.\n\n\n\nKirani predicts that India will lead the way in developing middleware and application layers for LLM engines, integrating and personalising AI to meet enterprise needs.\n\n\n\nHowever, he also acknowledges that India faces significant competition in building the core LLM engines. \u0093The West is investing billions of dollars in this space. It's unlikely that India will outpace these global players in LLM engine development in the short term.\u0094\n\n\n\nInstead, India's strength lies in its ability to adapt and integrate these engines, making them work for specific enterprises and personalising AI applications for users.\n\n\n\nAI'S IMPACT ON INDIA'S SAAS AND IT INDUSTRIES\n\n\n\nAccording to Kirani, the fusion of AI with India's services and SaaS industries presents a massive opportunity. India's USD 250 billion IT services industry is already partnering with SaaS startups to offer AI-powered solutions on an outcome-based pricing model. AI is not just revolutionising SaaS startups but is also reshaping the rules for the services industry.\n\n\n\n\u0093Much like the disruption we saw in global telecom prices that fuelled the growth of India's services companies, we are now witnessing AI's ability to elevate Indian SaaS companies to the next level,\u0094 Kirani explains.\n\n\n\nHe believes that India's engineering talent, combined with the right business model innovation, could make the country a shining global leader in AI productized services over the next decade.\n\n\n\nA NEW WAVE OF TECH DISRUPTION\n\n\n\nKirani predicts that the next wave of tech disruption is just beginning. Companies that fail to adapt to this new reality will perish, while a new generation of startups will emerge to ride the AI wave.\n\n\n\n\u0093At Accel, we are betting big on this wave, investing heavily in AI-based productized services. The future is bright for Indian startups that embrace the fusion of AI and services,\u0094 Kirani says.\n\nDISCLAIMER - This article is from a syndicated feed.

Paranormal Percussion is a local Halloween show that features only drums and percussion.\n\n\"I realized people in Utah really love Halloween and people love drumming so we kind of put the two together,\" said the show's founder, Matt Nickle.\n\nParanormal Percussion is put on by Warehouse 5 Drum Theatre. Nickles says the show is the perfect combination of spooky and family-friendly \"Each year I come up with new arrangements of things,\" Nickle said. \"I like playing the Ghostbusters theme, the Thriller theme, the funnest thing is playing on instruments that are a little unconventional like a coffin or a car.\"\n\n\"It's really just about a bunch of us drummers who have been drumming our whole life just getting out here and beating some drums and having a good time together,\" said Paranormal Percussions performer, Derek Julio.\n\nSince the show started in 2019 people have traveled from all across the state to see their favorite Halloween songs come to life on the stage. Nickles and Julio say the audience feedback so far has been spooktacular.\n\n\"It just feels wonderful when we know they have had a really good time, a really good experience,\" Julio said. \"It's meant to be spooky, it's meant to be a little fun, I think it's really funny, a lot of aspects of it,\" Julio said.\n\nWarehouse 5 Drum Theatre hopes to continue making audiences smile and putting drummers in the spotlight by eventually putting on other seasonal shows.\n\n\"It's really fulfilling for me, the first year was really scary because I had these arrangements, but I didn't know if they would make sense live but once we put the show together it was really nice,\" Nickles said.\n\nFor show times, locations, and tickets you can click here."

        "article_content": "Millions of scientific papers are published globally every year. These papers in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine present discoveries that range from the mundane to the profound.\n\nSince 1900, the number of published scientific articles has doubled about every 10 to 15 years; since 1980, about 8 percent to 9 percent annually. This acceleration reflects the immense and ever-growing scope of research across countless topics, from the farthest reaches of the cosmos to the intricacies of life on Earth and human nature.\n\nYet, this extraordinary expansion was once thought to be unsustainable.\n\nIn his influential 1963 book, Little Science, Big Science\u2026 And Beyond, the founder of scientometrics \u2013 or data informetrics related to scientific publications \u2013 Derek de Solla Price famously predicted limits to scientific growth.\n\nHe warned that the world would soon deplete its resources and talent pool for research. He imagined this would lead to a decline in new discoveries and potential crises in medicine, technology and the economy. At the time, scholars widely accepted his prediction of an impending slowdown in scientific progress.\n\nFaulty predictions\n\nIn fact, science has spectacularly defied Price's dire forecast. Instead of stagnation, the world now experiences \"global mega-science\" \u2013 a vast, ever-growing network of scientific discovery. This explosion of scientific production made Price's prediction of collapse perhaps the most stunningly incorrect forecast in the study of science.\n\nUnfortunately, Price died in 1983, too early to realize his mistake.\n\nSo, what explains the world's sustained and dramatically increasing capacity for scientific research?\n\nWe are sociologists who study higher education and science. Our new book, Global Mega-Science: Universities, Research Collaborations, and Knowledge Production, published on the 60th anniversary of Price's fateful prediction, offers explanations for this rapid and sustained scientific growth. It traces the history of scientific discovery globally.\n\nFactors such as economic growth, warfare, space races and geopolitical competition have undoubtedly spurred research capacity. But these factors alone cannot account for the immense scale of today's scientific enterprise.\n\nThe education revolution: Science's secret engine\n\nIn many ways, the world's scientific capacity has been built upon the educational aspirations of young adults pursuing higher education.\n\nOver the past 125 years, increasing demand for and access to higher education has sparked a global education revolution. Now, more than two-fifths of the world's young people ages 19-23, although with huge regional differences, are enrolled in higher education. This revolution is the engine driving scientific research capacity.\n\nToday, more than 38,000 universities and other higher-education institutions worldwide play a crucial role in scientific discovery. The educational mission, both publicly and privately funded, subsidizes the research mission, with a big part of students' tuition money going toward supporting faculty.\n\nThese faculty scientists balance their teaching with conducting extensive research. University-based scientists contribute 80 percent to 90 percent of the discoveries published each year in millions of papers.\n\nExternal research funding is still essential for specialized equipment, supplies and additional support for research time. But the day-to-day research capacity of universities, especially academics working in teams, forms the foundation of global scientific progress.\n\nEven the most generous national science and commercial research and development budgets cannot fully sustain the basic infrastructure and staffing needed for ongoing scientific discovery.\n\nLikewise, government labs and independent research institutes, such as the US National Institutes of Health or Germany's Max Planck Institutes, could not replace the production capacity that universities provide.\n\nCollaboration benefits science and society\n\nThe past few decades have also seen a surge in global scientific collaborations. These arrangements leverage diverse talent from around the world to enhance the quality of research.\n\nInternational collaborations have led to millions of co-authored papers. International research partnerships were relatively rare before 1980, accounting for just over 7,000 papers, or about 2 percent of the global output that year.\n\nBut by 2010 that number had surged to 440,000 papers, meaning 22 percent of the world's scientific publications resulted from international collaborations.\n\nThis growth, building on the \"collaboration dividend,\" continues today and has been shown to produce the highest-impact research.\n\nUniversities tend to share academic goals with other universities and have wide networks and a culture of openness, which makes these collaborations relatively easy.\n\nToday, universities also play a key role in international supercollaborations involving teams of hundreds or even thousands of scientists. In these huge collaborations, researchers can tackle major questions they wouldn't be able to in smaller groups with fewer resources.\n\nSupercollaborations have facilitated breakthroughs in understanding the intricate physics of the universe and the synthesis of evolution and genetics that scientists in a single country could never achieve alone.\n\nThe IceCube collaboration, a prime example of a global megacollaboration, has made big strides in understanding neutrinos, which are ghostly particles from space that pass through Earth. (Martin Wolf, IceCube/NSF)\n\nThe role of global hubs\n\nHubs made up of universities from around the world have made scientific research thoroughly global. The first of these global hubs, consisting of dozens of North American research universities, began in the 1970s. They expanded to Europe in the 1980s and most recently to Southeast Asia.\n\nThese regional hubs and alliances of universities link scientists from hundreds of universities to pursue collaborative research projects.\n\nScientists at these universities have often transcended geopolitical boundaries, with Iranian researchers publishing papers with Americans, Germans collaborating with Russians and Ukrainians, and Chinese scientists working with their Japanese and Korean counterparts.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrated the immense scale of international collaboration in global megascience. Within just six months of the start of the pandemic, the world's scientists had already published 23,000 scientific studies on the virus. These studies contributed to the rapid development of effective vaccines.\n\nWith universities' expanding global networks, the collaborations can spread through key research hubs to every part of the world.\n\nIs global megascience sustainable?\n\nBut despite the impressive growth of scientific output, this brand of highly collaborative and transnational megascience does face challenges.\n\nOn the one hand, birthrates in many countries that produce a lot of science are declining. On the other, many youth around the world, particularly those in low-income countries, have less access to higher education, although there is some recent progress in the Global South.\n\nSustaining these global collaborations and this high rate of scientific output will mean expanding access to higher education. That's because the funds from higher education subsidize research costs, and higher education trains the next generation of scientists.\n\nDe Solla Price couldn't have predicted how integral universities would be in driving global science. For better or worse, the future of scientific production is linked to the future of these institutions.\n\nDavid P. Baker, Professor of Sociology, Education and Demography, Penn State and Justin J.W.

She said: \"This is the first time we\u2019re ever seeing something like this.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"The planet appears to be made mostly of hot water vapour, making it something we\u2019re calling a 'steam world'.\"\n\nNaming the planet GJ 9827 d, it is around twice the size of Earth.\n\nFor years, astronomers had thought these kind of 'steam worlds' existed. They simply hadn't been able to prove so until now.\n\nCGI of the 'steam planet' and its nearby star (NASA, ESA, Leah Hustak (STScI), Ralf Crawford (STScI))\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd for those interested in all things extraterrestrial, calm down. GJ 9827 d, which is 100 light years from Earth, cannot host life as we know it. But its unique atmosphere opens new possibilities for studying other small planets and their potential to host life, the UoM team says.\n\nTo date, almost all exoplanets with measured atmospheres are mainly made of the lightest elements \u2014 hydrogen and helium \u2014 like the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system, Piaulet-Ghorayeb said.\n\nThat is, they\u2019re markedly different from Earth\u2019s life-enabling environment.\n\n\u201cGJ 9827 d is the first planet where we detect an atmosphere rich in heavy molecules like the terrestrial planets of the solar system,\u201d says Caroline Piaulet-Ghorayeb, from the University of Montr\u00e9al\u2019s Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets, who has led the study.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThis is a huge step.\u201d\n\nIllustration of the James Webb Space Telescope floating through space (JPL / NASA)\n\nIf it wasn't for the JWST, these finds simply couldn't happen, the researchers said.\n\nUoM astrophysicist and NASA Sagan Fellow, Ryan MacDonald, said: \"Even with JWST\u2019s early observations in 2022, researchers were discovering new insights into the atmospheres of distant gas giants.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"Now we\u2019re finally pushing down into what these mysterious worlds with sizes between Earth and Neptune, for which we don\u2019t have an example in our own solar system, are actually made of.\n\n\"This is a crucial proving step towards detecting atmospheres on habitable exoplanets in the years to come.\"\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope being constructed before launching in to the cosmos (NASA/Desiree Stover)\n\nBeing one of the very first people to see evidence of steam worlds, Raul said: \"It was a very surreal moment.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"We were searching specifically for water worlds because it was hypothesised that they could exist. If these are real, it really makes you wonder what else could be out there.\""

        "article_content": "The automation marketplace has changed vastly from what it was 30 years ago, but many trends persist and intensified during this time. The first is the increasing emphasis on software and services. Rapid advances in processing capability launched the decade of industrial, artificial intelligence (AI). Cloud computing, edge data processing, virtualization, containerization, Open Process Automation (OPA) and time-sensitive networks (TSN) have transformed the world of control systems. Suppliers continue to beef up their software capabilities, as we saw in 2022 with Emerson buying a majority stake in AspenTech, and Schneider Electric\u2019s acquisition of industrial software giant Aveva that closed in January 2023. ARC Advisory Group keeps reporting this in just about every Control/ARC Automation Top 50 article in recent memory, but software is the driving force behind today\u2019s market, and AI is now the tip of the spear. Suppliers know this, and will continue expanding and honing their software expertise and industrial AI solutions.\n\nGet your subscription to Control's tri-weekly newsletter.\n\nApproaching the Control/ARC Automation Top 50 global and North American automation suppliers is a unique exercise because we must keep one eye in the rearview mirror and the other on the road ahead. According to our standard methodology, ARC has a strict definition and scope of the automation marketplace that you can read about here. We examine supplier performance based on calendar-year revenues. ARC uses publicly available data in addition to information from our own database that we\u2019ve developed during more than 30 years of following the automation marketplace, the overall operations technology (OT) space, and the key end-user trends that drive them.\n\nHardware and services\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean hardware isn\u2019t important. The influx of commercial, IT-based solutions began in the automation marketplace more than 30 years ago, too, with the adoption of commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) operating systems and computing components. The industrial sector debated the benefits of Ethernet for years, until the dam finally burst, and just about every control network available today is based on Ethernet technologies with a few modifications. Today, this trend is accelerating faster than ever, with demand for industrial, edge-based systems and cloud-based automation architectures soaring. Computing requirements for industry will increase exponentially over the next decade, with AI again leading the way. Ethernet Advanced Physical Layer (APL) networking was also introduced in 2023, and will bring the benefits of Ethernet down to the device level and hazardous locations.\n\nAveva and AspenTech aren\u2019t the only recent software acquisitions, though they are substantial. In 2023 alone, ABB acquired a majority stake in Swedish AI startup Viking Analytics; Emerson acquired National Instruments (NI); PTC announced its acquisition of pure-systems; Belden acquired edge-software provider CloudRail; Rockwell Automation acquired OT cybersecurity provider Verve Industrial; and the list goes on. ARC expects more acquisitions as suppliers continue to strength their AI and cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s the services business for all of these automation suppliers that continues to grow at the fastest rate. Almost universally, supplier service revenues are increasing faster than either their hardware or software businesses. Suppliers continue to differentiate themselves based on their deep understanding and engineering knowledge of specific industrial and customer requirements, and are striving to create lifelong partnerships with their clients where they provide a continuous stream of value-added lifecycle services. Many of these services are increasingly tailored to help users get more value out of their sustainability and digital transformation programs.\n\nSupplier performance in 2023\n\nOn a year-over-year (YoY) basis, consolidated supplier revenues grew by 8% worldwide and by more than 3% in North America during 2022. This continues the post-COVID-19 growth trend that we\u2019ve seen since 2021, when the market sharply rebounded from the pandemic. In typical fashion, the discrete manufacturing markets were the first to contract and the first to bounce back, while the process industries lagged slightly behind.\n\nIn typical fashion, the overall market leaders haven\u2019t changed significantly, though some smaller suppliers gained ground during 2023. It\u2019s worth noting that changes in relative position on this list don\u2019t necessarily indicate the strength or competence of any supplier, and could be due to other factors, the most obvious being merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. This list will give you an idea of who the market leaders are, but any evaluation of suppliers should obviously be more in-depth than their positions in the Control/ARC Top 50 rankings. With the rapid changes taking place in the automation market, it\u2019s also a good time to reevaluate supplier selection criteria.\n\nBig acquisitions fortify positions\n\nEmerson\u2019s acquisition of NI cemented its number-one position in North America with total revenues close to $8 billion. NI\u2019s consolidation into Emerson also removed it from the list, affecting the relative positions of other suppliers.\n\nThe same happened with Schneider Electric, which now wholly owns Aveva. It likewise cemented its number-four position worldwide, and moved up the list in North America to the number four position, placing it very close to ABB. In North America, Hexagon gained some ground to reach the eighth slot by acquiring several software suppliers concentrated in the digitalization, optimization and AI spaces.\n\nAutomation market hitting a wall?\n\nAfter robust growth following the COVID-19 pandemic, the global and North American automation markets remain strong, but they\u2019re also facing some serious headwinds and signs of softening in several sectors. We expect an overall slowdown in growth, but not a market contraction. Uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election and mounting geopolitical conflicts and tensions also contribute to future market uncertainty.\n\nFor example, ARC\u2019s Automation Index declined in 2Q24, which was the first time since the post-pandemic recovery. The automation markets had experienced growth since 3Q20 (past 12 consecutive quarters). Demand for automation products continued to expand in the U.S. market, but at a slower pace. The YoY growth cycle started showing a decline since late 3Q23, and shows further decline through 1Q24. Many of the leading automation suppliers in North America have also increased prices to keep pace with rising production and distribution costs.\n\nMany of the key automation suppliers in North America are reporting strong backlogs, which they plan to work through in 2024. ARC is seeing a shift in growth from converting backlogs to new orders as distributors and machine builders reduce excess inventory. Supply-chain issues have also eased since our last report, and because of this, we\u2019re witnessing improved lead times.\n\nNew energy and decarbonization activities also remain strong, as we'll discuss later in this report. Aside from obvious investments in renewable energy, sustainability is also driving investments in automation for hydrogen infrastructure and its frequent counterpart, carbon capture and storage. Investment in plastics and other recycling technologies, such as wind turbine blade recycling, are increasing. Electrification, utilities, data centers and infrastructure (rail, port and marine) sectors are all experiencing strong growth.\n\nHowever, automotive growth remains weak as automotive manufacturers focus on near-term profitability amid a slowdown in demand for electric vehicles. In addition, semiconductor growth remains weak as manufacturers face several different challenges, including excess memory capacity and workforce shortages. Despite these signs of softening, our outlook remains positive for continued growth in both North America and worldwide through the end of 2024.\n\nHow AI is transforming industry\n\nAI has revolutionized the way we approach problem-solving and decision-making in various industries. Often described as prediction machines or inference engines, AI systems are designed to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions about future events or outcomes. This predictive capability is central to AI's value proposition, enabling businesses to anticipate trends, optimize processes, and make informed decisions. For instance, in the industrial sector, the most widely deployed AI use case involves predicting equipment failures before they occur, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.\n\nThe surge in investment in AI infrastructure is a testament to this technology's transformative potential. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs have highlighted the rapid growth in AI investment since the breakthrough of Generative AI (Gen AI) with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5, with projections indicating a global spend nearing $200 billion by 2025.\n\nOver the longer-term, AI-related investment could peak as high as 2.5% to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the U.S. and 1.5 to 2.5% of GDP among other major AI leaders, if Goldman Sachs Research\u2019s AI growth projections are fully realized. This investment is driving down the cost of AI solutions, making them more accessible, and enabling broader adoption across industrial sectors. They\u2019re hungry to apply the technology to address growing skills gaps, control spiraling energy costs, and meet demand for more sustainable products and services with more resilient supply chains.\n\nAI and the data explosion\n\nThe industrial sector's challenges aren\u2019t just about volume, but also involve the complexity and fragmentation of data generated by sensors, machines and smart factories. This data is often disconnected and scattered across various applications, making it difficult to harness for insights and decision-making. Many end-users find it necessary to build a better framework for managing data when implementing new technologies like AI, and this is driving growth in industrial IoT platforms like Honeywell\u2019s Forge, Siemens\u2019 MindSphere, ABB\u2019s Ability, Rockwell Automation\u2019s FactoryTalk InnovationSuite, and Schneider Electric\u2019s EcoStruxure. Other suppliers like Yokogawa are implementing their own industrial AI platforms that allow connections between operational assets and the enterprise.\n\nEach industrial AI use case requires specific datasets, and may necessitate different tools and techniques. For instance, predictive maintenance relies on sensor data to forecast equipment failures, while generative design uses parameters like materials and cost constraints to create product designs.\n\nSustainability drives digital transformation\n\nThe real question is how all this technology is applied and what its business case is. Energy transition and sustainability are being woven into the core business strategies of most of the world\u2019s largest industrial companies, which now have a mandate and opportunity to not only to tackle environmental and social challenges, but also take advantage of the commercial opportunities and competitive advantages that sustainability offers.\n\nFor several years, sustainability issues were approached as something to be dealt with cautiously in reaction to increasingly stringent regulations. However, massive commercial opportunities have emerged beyond just regulatory compliance. Many companies are discovering that ramping up digital transformation initiatives can help reach their sustainability goals. Sustainability can provide business value across several dimensions, including increased energy efficiency, new processes for carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen production and transportation.\n\nSpending on sustainability increases\n\nFor instance, Bank of America (BoA) reports that, prior to COVID-19, the U.S. spent about 0.4% of GDP on sustainability-related industrial policy, while Germany spent 0.5% or more, and the EU\u2019s other member nations spent more traditionally. Today, the U.S. spends 0.8% of GDP on sustainability-related industrial policy thanks to passing its $1.8 trillion stimulus package. The most recent stimulus is structured quite differently from what the U.S. did before. It doesn't peak until 2026, and will run until 2031. The stimulus was designed so that many projects are in \u201cred states,\u201d and $2.4 trillion is needed to meet net-zero emission targets laid out for the U.S. over the next five years, according to BoA\u2019s research.\n\nMost companies are enhancing energy efficiency and switching to clean-energy sources. Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) facilities have also been growing significantly. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, Section 45 Q tax credits for capturing carbon have increased to $85 per ton, and most companies can do this at a much lower cost. This makes CCUS extremely profitable, which is why we see so much activity in it, including ExxonMobil\u2019s acquisition of Denbury, Occidental\u2019s acquisition of Carbon Engineering and others.\n\nEdge computing push intensifies\n\nIndustrial, edge-computing solutions can overcome limitations such as latency, reliability and security by extending the cloud into OT environments, while also reducing cloud-input data volumes and egress costs. Data at the edge of networks can be aggregated and contextualized to deliver summary information and insights directly to the cloud, ultimately reducing cloud-based, data-storage costs. Edge functionality has likewise expanded digital transformation\u2019s reach into remote, hazardous and other distributed environments, simultaneously addressing potential lacks of reliable network connections and skilled IT personnel in the field.\n\nCustomers and suppliers alike are aligning their edge strategies to take advantage of the cloud\u2019s centralized management, security and scaling capabilities, while preserving operational integrity by marrying these with onsite, edge capabilities. The descent of cloud-native, containerized architectures to the edge is simplifying deployment and management of edge applications, a key edge value driver, by providing a lightweight and portable way to package software and its dependencies. Industrial data can be pre-processed at the edge, sent to the cloud for analytics or model training, and then redeployed at the edge in lightweight software containers.\n\nIndustrial automation and cloud-native architectures are coming together, while industrial automation itself is increasingly software-defined. The data sought by edge and cloud-based solutions resides in the logic, process and motion controllers sold by traditional automation suppliers, which are typically large players with deep domain knowledge that closely integrate their edge offerings with their higher-level, software-based solutions.\n\nThese products typically focus on domain-specific use cases that relate to their core automation competencies. Early offerings look to apply analytics to monitoring and maintenance applications focused on reduced downtime and asset utilization objectives. Automation suppliers are also taking advantage of existing edge technology and ecosystems, and partnering with and/or investing in complementary infrastructures, open-source and multiple cloud providers."

        "article_content": "It has been my observation that, on average, a significant event or trend has arisen at least every 10 years that reshapes the insurance industry. When considering the emerging trends with the most potential to impact insurance in the future, it is helpful to review the past. There are three historical trends that significantly challenged the industry at the time that they occurred. Insurance experts adapted to these events and will continue to rise to the challenge of managing emerging risks, no matter how insurmountable they might appear at first.\n\nThree past trends that shook the insurance world\n\n1. Litigation Funding (1990s): In the early 1990s, when I was starting my career in insurance, Australia made legal changes that had a worldwide impact. They allowed insolvency practitioners to enter into contracts to finance litigation, including class-action lawsuits.\n\nThese changes influenced other countries, including the U.S. Before the mid-2000s, the U.S. litigation financing industry was limited to personal injury cases. The industry has grown significantly since the inception of specialized commercial litigation funding in 2006. Meanwhile, insurance affordability has come under threat from litigation and claim cost increases.\n\nThese drive 'social inflation' \u2014 the increased legal costs from outsized jury awards and legal proceedings that take longer to resolve.\n\n2. Reptile Theory (2009): In 2009, a jury consultant, David Ball, and a plaintiff lawyer, Don Keenan, published Reptile: the 2009 Manual of the Plaintiff's Revolution, which outlined how to influence jurors by appealing to the 'Triune Brain,' the primal part of our minds.\n\nThe plaintiff's lawyer encourages jurors to instinctively perceive the defendant's alleged conduct as a threat to their own personal safety rather than deciding the case based on factual information around the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant.\n\nNeuroscientists have pointed out that 'reptile theory' is based on a false scientific premise. However, the authors claim evidence of the success of their approach, citing over $7.7bn in verdicts and settlements are due to reptile theory .\n\nToday, lawyers, plaintiffs, investors and even doctors work together on the litigation. They are able to sustain lawsuits for a long period of time, which has caused a seismic shift in the underwriting landscape. The payouts are substantial if the plaintiff lawyers successfully convince the jury that the action in question is so egregious that there has to be strong compensation. This, too, is supercharging social inflation.\n\n3. Distracted Driving (mid- 2010s):\n\nAs mobile devices became ubiquitous in daily life over the past decade, distracted driving became a contributing cause of vehicular accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), distracted driving claimed 3,308 lives in 2022 and close to 290,000 people were injured.\n\nLaws regarding cell phone use while driving emerged in the mid-to-late 2010s. From a personal perspective, a conviction can lead to a loss of coverage or increased insurance premiums.\n\nHowever, in cases where distracted driving results in severe injury or death, drivers may face lawsuits from victims or their families. This can lead to substantial financial losses, including the payment of damages, legal fees and other expenses associated with litigation. This is a significant factor driving up auto liability insurance in many regions of the U.S.\n\nFor commercial drivers, distracted driving incidents and accidents can have significant financial, legal, and reputational consequences for companies. The financial strain from crash-related costs can be substantial. On average, a distracted driving accident costs the employer $72,442.\n\nThree current and future trends that could disrupt the liability landscape\n\n1. Wildfires: On October 22, 2007, a small fire started at Witch Creek, California, whipped by Santa Ana winds, and merged with the Guejito Fire from San Pasqual Valley at the San Diego City limits. More than 197,990 acres of San Diego County burned, including 9,250 acres in the city of San Diego. Some 1,141 residences were destroyed.\n\nCalifornia had wildfires in the past, but the intensity and widespread damage they caused, including in urban areas, was off the scale and signalled a shift in the frequency and severity of this emerging threat.\n\nAs the world heats up, so does the litigation. In California, and increasingly other states, utilities are being hit with significant payouts for their role in starting fires. While the legal victories assist victims to rebuild their homes and lives, the wave of litigation is making it difficult for the companies to fund grid upgrades to fireproof their infrastructure. As a result, they are more likely to pass costs on to consumers.\n\nThis is an immediate problem. It is getting to the point where wildfire is almost becoming an uninsurable risk. The 2023 fires in Maui, Hawaii, are an example of the devastating impact of wildfires in regions that have not experienced them in the past.\n\nThere are more wildfires of growing intensity. State and private organizations need wildfire insurance, but, increasingly, insurance companies cannot infinitely cover wildfire-prone regions.\n\n2. Addictive software: Many apps tap into the human need for affirmation, approval and connection and dispense rewards on a variable schedule. Whenever we open a social app, we check if someone has liked our comment, sent a message, left a photo, or written a status update. So, we continue to scroll, swipe left and tap the red dot.\n\nSoftware developers use the Hook Model to design products or services that customers engage with regularly and voluntarily. Its primary aim is to foster customer habits by frequently linking a customer's need with the company's solution, making the interaction a consistent and repeated behavior. By implementing the Hook Model, businesses effectively shape customer behavior by creating recurring actions centered around their products. To achieve this, companies guide customers through a series of experiences known as \"hooks.\" As customers encounter these hooks repeatedly, the likelihood increases that the hooks will become ingrained as habits.\n\nIt is a way of exploiting behavior that could be increasingly open to litigation, particularly if social media is shown to alter the brain anatomy and impact children's mental health.\n\n3. Virtual Reality: As a decades-long liability insurance professional, addictive software may be the most disturbing of the three trends on my radar, however, virtual reality is a close second.\n\nIf this technology develops as anticipated, it will involve collecting unprecedented amounts of user data on what users buy, view and discuss in this alternative world. Apart from current obligations to protect data, it could raise complex questions concerning privacy. For example, could a virtual reality user breach the privacy of another user, and could the platform be liable for failing to prevent the breach?\n\nThere will be questions about product liability as the omniverse develops into a vast market for virtual products and hardware like headsets and glasses. Product liability claims could result from people sustaining bodily injury in the real world.\n\nComplicated and novel arguments could arise, including questions surrounding who is liable for virtual-related claims, choice of law and forum, and where a claim could be brought when loss or injury occurs while in the virtual realm. The coverage territory of umbrella policies is potentially limiting, and one can argue that the omniverse is not in the world, so bodily injury sustained there may not be covered.\n\nGiven the potential for a range of liability claims in connection with this technology, industry participants will want to obtain legal advice and consider how to limit their liability before they take the virtual plunge.\n\nHow to meet the challenges of emerging liabilities\n\nThere will always be new challenges facing insurers and their clients as technology advances and the world evolves. Finding solutions to mitigate the risks of these new threats is a key role that liability underwriters and their broker-partners play while moving the industry forward.\n\nCollaboration is needed to manage the environmental, technological and social advances that lie ahead. The de-escalation of social inflation begins with partnerships. In a world where social media has led to a loss of individual control over communication, we need a clearer idea of where individual responsibility begins and ends in this area. We need a better consensus on the guidance we give about children's use of social media. There will be a call for regulation in certain areas of the omniverse and artificial intelligence.\n\nBusinesses can play their part by responsibly managing emerging risk trends, ranging from wildfire to artificial intelligence. Governments could take responsibility with tort reform \u2014 accelerating legal changes that align plaintiff compensation with the needs of injured parties.\n\nAs insurers, we will play our role by leveraging new technology to improve corporate liability underwriting, resulting in improved data precision, interpretation and application to an ever-evolving world.\n\nReprinted with permission from Allianz Global Risks US Insurance Company."
