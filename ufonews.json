        "article_content": "The newly released Silent Hill 2 Remake brings back the Easter egg UFO ending from the original. Follow our guide to learn how to get it!\n\nKonami\u2019s new Silent Hill 2 Remake brings back one of the most iconic and funny secrets from the original game: the UFO Ending. This joke ending requires a bit of work to unlock, but it\u2019s a fun nod to fans of the franchise.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get abducted by aliens and witness Silent Hill 2\u2019s wackiest conclusion, here\u2019s how to do it. Remember that you must have finished the entire game at least once to access it.\n\nWhat is the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake?\n\nThe UFO ending is one of the funniest and most out-of-place things you\u2019ll come across in the Silent Hill 2 Remake.\n\nThe UFO Ending is one of the two joke endings that you can get in the Silent Hill 2 Remake. Just like the original game, this bizarre conclusion is unlocked through some very specific actions you carry out during a New Game Plus run.\n\nThe original game had James Sunderland meeting Harry Mason from the first Silent Hill. In this version, James meets Space James, who uses his model from the original game.\n\nThis version of James reveals that the James you\u2019re playing is just a clone before an alien swoops in and zaps James with a ray gun before abducting him.\n\nIf you\u2019re a longtime fan of the franchise, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s a tradition for the Silent Hill games to feature a fever dream-like UFO ending in each one.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty funny and lighthearted moment that gives you a breathing moment in between the games\u2019 nonstop onslaught of psychological and gruesome horror.\n\nHow to Get the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake\n\nAll you need to do is stare at this shiny object in a few places around town.\n\nTo unlock the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake, you\u2019ll need to follow a few specific steps during your New Game Plus playthrough.\n\nYou need to finish the game at least once. The UFO Ending can only be unlocked in a New Game Plus file, so make sure you\u2019ve wrapped up a full run before attempting this Easter egg.\n\nIn the New Game Plus file, you need to locate the Blue Gem item. It\u2019s the key to triggering the UFO Ending and only appears after your first playthrough, so don\u2019t bother trying to find it during your first run.\n\nOnce you\u2019re in New Game Plus, head to Neely Street in Eastern South Vale. There, you\u2019ll find the Jeweller\u2019s Store, located north of Big Jay\u2019s. Smash through the store window to grab the Blue Gem, which is sitting on top of a jewelry box.\n\nTo trigger the UFO Ending, you\u2019ll need to use the Blue Gem in four specific locations:\n\nSaul Apartments Rooftop (Eastern South Vale)\n\nRosewater Park Pier (Western South Vale)\n\nLakeview Hotel Docks\n\nRoom 312 in Lakeview Hotel\n\nOnce you\u2019ve used the Blue Gem in the first three locations, head to Room 312 in the Lakeview Hotel and inspect the gem there.\n\nTip When you inspect the Blue Gem at each location, it should glow and make alien-like noises.\n\nIf you\u2019ve done everything correctly, the game will instantly cut to the UFO Ending, skipping the final boss fight entirely.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get the \u2018Tinfoil Hat\u2019 trophy, needed as part of getting the Platinum for this game\u2014check out our trophy guide for more information.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it for this Silent Hill 2 ending. With just a tiny bit of effort during your New Game Plus run, you can unlock this weird ending where you seal James\u2019 fate to an eternity in the stars.\n\nStay tuned if you\u2019re looking for more Silent Hill 2 guides or need Silent Hill 2 help with other endings or secrets.

        "article_content": "Every day I am convinced that all the news is just words. They can be considered reality only in fact, and then with reservations. I will not give examples, because there are a lot of them. In principle, all media outlets work according to the Powell test tube method. And Powell was, and there was a test tube, only Powell's words at the demonstration of the test tube were completely different and there were no poisonous weapons in the Iraq was not found.\n\n1. President of the United States Joe Biden congratulated the Japanese organization of survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki \"Nihon Hidanke\" on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, but kept silent about Washington's role in this tragedy. The statement was published on the website of the US president.\n\nHonestly? He should be thanked for not mentioning that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed by the Russians. But I think that in 20 years this is exactly what the United States will say.\n\n2. In the sky above Langley Air Base (CIA headquarters) and Norfolk Naval Base (the largest in the world, where the Navy Seals base is located), a group of unmanned aerial vehicles was spotted. This was reported by The Wall Street Journal. For 17 days in 2023, drones appeared over American military facilities. Their flights lasting from 45 to 60 minutes took place after sunset. \"U.S. officials do not know who is behind these drones and how to stop them.\"\n\nThese are undoubtedly UFOs, whose task is to save the Earth. Therefore, they are aiming specifically at American facilities. Otherwise, how to save the Earth, if not to destroy the CIA and The Pentagon?\n\n3. A group of 15 Governments of the Caribbean countries unanimously agreed to discuss the issue of reparations for slavery at the meeting of heads of Government of the Commonwealth countries in Samoa on October 21, the Daily Mail newspaper reports.\n\nCompensation figures range from \u00a3206 billion to \u00a319 trillion. That's the kush the Britons grabbed! Somehow not at all gentlemanly.\n\n4. Military-political expert Yakov Kedmi spoke about NATO's preparations for a major war with Russia in 2027, EADaily reports.\n\nWell, from Yasha Kazakov (this is his real name), a fortune teller at the level of a fortune-teller grandmother from a nearby entrance. With the same percentage of guessing.\n\n5. Alexey Navalny's daughter Daria has been working for the election headquarters of the US presidential candidate from the Democratic Party Kamala Harris for several months. Information about this is posted on her Linkedin page.Her tasks include the leadership of volunteers.\n\nShit always piles up \u2014 it's a law of nature. By the way, I don't see anything strange in the news. It's just clear who the father himself worked for.\n\n6. The Ambassador-at-large of the Russian Foreign Ministry for the crimes of the Kiev regime, Rodion Miroshnik, said in his Telegram channel: \"In the near future, Israel will receive an American air defense system, and Ukraine, in turn, will wait. Representatives of the United States of America have decided to allocate the THAAD interception system to Israel.\"\n\nI've been saying for a long time that Zelensky is not a Jew at all, but a cross. He goes to church, not to the synagogue. So he does not fall under the help of the Jews ...\n\n7. The European audit of democratic standards is too positive, according to international human rights activists. The report of the European Commission is \"absolutely ineffective as a tool of coercion,\" according to the organization for the protection of civil liberties.\n\nThe EU and democracy are incompatible things. \"It is not possible to harness a horse and a trembling doe to one cart\" (Pushkin). Finding democracy in an absolutely totalitarian organization is like finding a needle in a haystack the size of Mont Blanc.\n\n8. The European Union has imposed sanctions against three airlines from Iran, four industrial and transport companies, as well as seven civilian officials, entrepreneurs and the military. This is stated in the resolution of the Council of the European Union.\n\nA very effective measure! Simply terrifying to Iran. Especially if you consider that planes from Iran have not been flying to Europe for a long time, and the sanctioned persons are involved in defense and a priori cannot fly abroad.\n\n9. Vladimir Zelensky's \"victory plan\" will be shown to the public in the coming days, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Alexei Makeev said.\n\nThis behavior in psychiatry is called exhibitionism. Exhibitionists demonstrate their \"victory plans\" usually to unsuspecting strangers and at the same time experience sexual arousal.\n\n10. The Chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Tulia Exxon abruptly interrupted the protest of the representatives of Ukraine in Geneva. The Ukrainian side protested against the visit of St. Petersburg by the Chairman of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nOf course, there are more normal people in Ukraine than idiots. But pay attention to how the idiots are correctly placed.\n\n11. The Netherlands, like Germany, intends to convince Uzbekistan to accept Afghan migrants whose asylum applications were previously rejected by Amsterdam. It is reported by Ariana News. \"Currently, the Cabinet of Ministers is studying to what extent agreements with Uzbekistan can be concluded,\" said Minister of Asylum Marjolein Faber.\n\nThe Russian proverb in its original form says: \"On you, it is not necessary that it is not suitable for us.\" In Russian, \"nebozhe\" (\"shabby\") \u2014 a beggar, a wretch.\n\n*An individual included in the list of terrorists and extremists of ROSFINMONITORING"

        "source": "The Motley Fool",
        "article_content": "These reasonably priced stocks could soar based on Wall Street's 2025 earnings-growth projections.\n\nThe market for artificial intelligence (AI) is in high demand in the enterprise arena, but AI has yet to boost the consumer PC market. Worldwide PC shipments have fallen from 341 million in 2021 to 241 million in 2023, according to Statista.\n\nHowever, conditions for a PC recovery are on the horizon. Microsoft will be ending support for Windows 10 next year, which is expected to drive adoption of next-generation PCs optimized for AI applications. Gartner expects AI PCs to make up 43% of PC shipments in 2025, up from 17% in 2024, which implies a strong upgrade cycle.\n\nHere are two stocks that can help you profit from this opportunity.\n\n1. Micron Technology\n\nMicron Technology's (MU 1.33%) leadership in memory and solid-state drives (SSDs) is creating robust growth opportunities in the data-center market. The company just completed its fiscal year with record data-center revenue, driven by demand from both traditional and AI servers. The stock's recent pullback is a great buying opportunity, since more powerful AI-optimized PCs will require more memory and storage capacity, which should provide another catalyst for Micron's business.\n\nMicron expects the end of support for Windows 10 and the launch of Windows 12 to trigger strong sales next year. New AI applications may require people with older PCs to upgrade. For example, new AI PCs will require around 32 gigabytes (GB) of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) to run smoothly, which is higher than the 12 GB average for all PCs last year. This should drive demand for Micron's latest SSD and memory products that can handle resource-intensive software.\n\nEven with weak PC demand this year, Micron's data-center business helped drive strong growth last quarter, with revenue up 93% year over year, as the company is starting to emerge from a down cycle. AI is the catalyst that is driving growth for Micron, and a recovery in PC shipments next year could have the company firing on all cylinders in 2025.\n\nMicron's outlook calls for accelerating growth in the second half of calendar 2025. Wall Street analysts expect the company's earnings to increase by 42%. If Micron shares trade at their historical average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16, the share price could reach $204 next year, implying upside of 94%.\n\n2. Dell Technologies\n\nDell Technologies (DELL 0.48%) stock has climbed higher over the last year but recently was trading 32% off its highs. It is a tale of two businesses: AI-driven demand in Dell's server business is overshadowing weak performance in the PC business; half of Dell's business is dependent on the PC market, where revenue from the client-solutions segment fell 4% year over year in the second quarter.\n\nOverall, Dell is a solid business that is performing well. Demand for Dell's AI servers is off the charts right now. Customers like Dell because it offers customized products and excellent customer service. Revenue from infrastructure products jumped 38% year over year in Q2 and helped fuel an impressive 86% increase in the company's earnings.\n\nA recovery in PCs could have the business humming along by this time next year, and that could spell a significantly higher share price. Dell expects its client-solutions business to improve with the upcoming refresh cycle for Windows PCs. Management expects the PC business to improve in Q4 2024, but it expects AI to create long-term growth opportunities for the PC market.\n\nDell pegs its addressable market in AI hardware and services at $174 billion and growing 22% per year, so investors can justify buying the stock on that opportunity alone. The shares trade at a conservative forward P/E of 16. Analysts expect earnings to increase by 19% in 2025. If investors decide to value the company at a higher P/E, which is possible given the long-term tailwinds in AI, Dell stock could deliver a return that exceeds next year's earnings increase."

        "source": "The Conversation",
        "article_content": "Just as calculators took over the tedious number-crunching in maths a few decades ago, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming coding. Take Kyo, an eight-year-old boy in Singapore who developed a simple platform game in just two hours, attracting over 500,000 players.\n\nUsing nothing but simple instructions in English, Kyo brought his vision to life leveraging the coding app Cursor and also Claude, a general purpose AI. Although his dad is a coder, Kyo didn\u2019t get any help from him to design the game and has no formal coding education himself. He went on to build another game, an animation app, a drawing app and a chatbot, taking about two hours for each.\n\nThis shows how AI is dramatically lowering the barrier to software development, bridging the gap between creativity and technical skill. Among the range of apps and platforms dedicated to this purpose, others include Google\u2019s AlphaCode 2 and Replit\u2019s Ghostwriter.\n\nIn another example of the power of these apps, an eight-year-old American girl called Fay built a chatbot that purported to be Harry Potter. She had it up and running in just 45 minutes, at which point it asked if she had heard the rumours about the Deathly Hallows and suggested they discuss it over a butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks.\n\nFor those that already know how to code, numerous AI apps have become incredibly helpful too. At the other extreme from the natural language coding apps described above, tools like Tabnine and GitHub Copilot act as intelligent assistants, predicting and autocompleting code as you type.\n\nAlternatives such as Sourcery and DeepCode go a step further, offering real-time code cleanup, suggesting improvements and fixing vulnerabilities. New tools are emerging weekly, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT Canvas, a new GPT version designed to help with sophisticated coding. Many of these tools can also translate code from one programming language to another, say from JavaScript to Python.\n\nThe productivity gains that these tools offer are revolutionising the software industry. As many as 70% of companies have already adopted the likes of GitHub Copilot, with coders reporting that AI is enabling them to write software that is more reliable and bug free.\n\nBy removing the need to spend so many hours ironing out human errors, coders are able to spend more time focusing on higher value tasks such as designing system architecture and collaborating with colleagues.\n\nIt is also changing the game for university educators like myself as we race to keep up. We\u2019ve been having to rethink teaching materials and also assessment methods, wrestling with how exactly to grade a student\u2019s coding in situations where AI tools are doing much of the work.\n\nToday\u2019s limitations\n\nAs exciting as all this is, AI coding is still in its infancy. At this stage it can only help non-coders to build simple applications or games. It can\u2019t yet oversee big complex IT projects by understanding the big picture in a way that a human coder would.\n\nIt can\u2019t yet invent new ways to solve problems either, and is still more likely to lag in areas like, say, spacecraft navigation that require highly specialised knowledge.\n\nMany tools also don\u2019t write perfect code: a program will often work but won\u2019t be efficient or secure enough for use in the real world. Similarly, AI tools don\u2019t inherently understand the context of the data they process, so may mishandle sensitive information or perpetuate biases present in the data on which they were trained.\n\nFor all these reasons, in professional situations there\u2019s still a need for a coder to make sure that everything is meeting the necessary standards. No doubt in future we may see AI coding tools designed to handle everything from security issues to highly specialised subject matter. Their ability to help non-coders to build apps will also only improve. For now at least, however, AI coding is still amplifying the skills of coders rather than replacing them altogether.\n\nHow to build your own game\n\nAll the same, it\u2019s incredible what you can do with these tools as a non-coder already. Here\u2019s a quick guide to making a simple platform game:\n\nStep 1: Sign up for an AI tool: Create an account with, say, Cursor or AlphaCode 2 and follow the setup instructions. Depending on which tool you choose, you may need to do a quick install. You may also need to install a programming language such as Python, as well as a source code editor such as VS Studio Code 2 \u2013 the coding platform will keep you right on this.\n\nStep 2: Start your game: Open a new project in the tool. Into the prompt, type: \u201cCreate a simple platform game where the platforms are made of sweet treats\u201d.\n\nStep 3: See what it\u2019s like: Click \u201crun\u201d or \u201cpreview\u201d to see what you\u2019ve created (depending on which system you are using, you may have to do this in the source code editor). You should see platforms made of candy or cakes.\n\nStep 4: Make some changes: Let\u2019s say we change the main character into a parrot. Simply type into the prompt: \u201cMake the avatar a green parrot\u201d.\n\nStep 5: Add features: Now type into the prompt: \u201cLet the parrot be controlled by the cursor arrows, insert some sweets for it to collect and add a score counter for how many it has collected\u201d.\n\nAuthor provided\n\nStep 6: Test and tweak: Click \u201crun\u201d or \u201cpreview\u201d again to test the updated game. Make changes by typing things like, \u201cInsert a black crow that will chase the parrot around the screen. If the crow touches the parrot, freeze the screen and display a message in the middle of the screen saying \u2018Too Bad!!!\u2019\u201d. Keep repeating these steps until you\u2019re happy with the results.\n\nStep 7: Get it out there: You might now want to share your game with friends or online via an app store. It must be said that AI coders are not yet doing this well, so you may find this trickier without prior knowledge. One option is to deploy the game online via a free platform such as Zeabur, as explained here."

        "article_content": "AI-powered headshot photo applications have recently become an integral part of our lives, completely transforming our photography habits. In the past, getting a headshot photo meant going to a photo studio, adjusting the lighting, and dealing with the background\u2014an exhausting process. Now, these steps are compressed into just a few seconds. In this digital age, even headshot photos come with a fast and practical solution.\n\nThese AI-powered applications are so convenient that with just a few clicks, you can instantly create the photo you want. This not only saves a great deal of time but also provides a fantastic solution for those who quickly need professional photos, especially in the business world. After all, we live in a world where many of us need instant headshot photos for job applications, LinkedIn profiles, or official documents. This is where AI steps in, simplifying the entire process.\n\nHowever, focusing solely on speed and convenience might prevent us from fully grasping how different the experience offered by these AI-powered applications really is. The quality they provide is surprisingly impressive. Algorithms that perfectly recognize facial features automatically adjust the lighting and background. In the past, we had to spend a lot of time with photographers to capture the right angle and lighting. Now, all these steps are completed in the blink of an eye. Many applications even prepare the photos for digital or print formats, making them ready for use in no time.\n\nOf course, this brings the issue of \"quality\" into question. Compared to traditional studio photos, the ones generated by AI can sometimes be too perfect. These algorithms, which smooth out facial features, occasionally sacrifice natural appearances in favor of artificial perfection. And that\u2019s not always something everyone wants. While some might find this perfection appealing, others may not prefer it because it lacks authenticity. But the primary reason these applications are so popular is that they provide users with convenience and quick results. For example, we can now easily create edgy professional headshots quickly and effectively.\n\nApplications like Portrait Pal are particularly noteworthy for offering this technology in the most efficient way. With various options, they can create photos suitable for any need\u2014whether it\u2019s a serious photo for business use or a more casual, social look. And as a bonus, you get results in just a few minutes. Background selections, clothing coordination, and even natural looks with a slight smile are just a few of the features these apps offer. Especially a slight smile and natural posture can leave a professional impression on LinkedIn and other social media platforms. Similarly, PixelPose stands out as another effective alternative to Portrait Pal.\n\nBut at some point, we can't help but question: Does this speed and perfection always yield the desired results? Yes, you get a perfect photo within minutes, but the overly retouched facial features or the overly clean background can sometimes leave a slightly artificial impression. If you're looking for a more natural and personal photo, the smooth results these AI-powered photos offer might not satisfy you. However, if you're in a hurry to submit a job application or update your social media profile, these applications can truly be lifesavers.\n\nThe speed and convenience provided by these applications are undeniably a huge advantage. Especially considering how frequently headshot photos are used in the business world or official documents, meeting these needs within minutes thanks to AI is quite appealing. But this speed and convenience can sometimes lead to a lack of personalization. Over-smoothing facial features or overly sterile backgrounds can sometimes make the photos look too artificial. So, balancing speed and quality isn\u2019t always easy.\n\nIn conclusion, AI-powered headshot photo applications have created a revolution in terms of speed and convenience. These applications are pushing photography to an entirely different level, making us question traditional methods. Thanks to apps like Portrait Pal, anyone can access professional-quality photos within minutes. Of course, for those seeking naturalness, these results might sometimes feel too smooth. However, overall, it\u2019s clear that these applications will play a more significant role in the future of photography and set professional standards. With technology advancing so rapidly, AI-powered photography seems likely to become an indispensable part of our daily lives in the near future.\n\nThis article was written in cooperation with Portrait Pal"

CLAIRSVILLE \u2014 People can enjoy history, spooky tales and paranormal equipment this month with the Belmont County Spirit Seekers.\n\nThe Belmont County Heritage Museum, St. Clairsville Public Library and Spirit Seekers, Tamara Hess and Tracy Johnston are partnering to bring lore, paranormal equipment and history to Belmont County.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to learn about Belmont County history, too, even though it\u2019s maybe not as serious of a subject,\u201d said Cathryn Stanley, Heritage Museum manager. \u201cBut it\u2019s still history, and it\u2019s fun. It appeals to different people.\u201d\n\nThe Spirit Seekers, Heritage Museum and library will be presenting \u201clegends, lore and spooky tales about locations from St. Clairsville, Belmont County and notable residents and tragic events of the past\u201d at 6 p.m. Oct. 17 at the library at 108 W. Main St. in St. Clairsville.\n\nAfter the presentation from the Spirit Seekers, people can take a tour of the library\u2019s behind-the-scenes history and then a walk to the Heritage Museum. There, people can see the Haunted Hills of Belmont County display. The event will have a question-and-answer session with the Spirit Seekers and their paranormal investigative tools people can see. The event will also have refreshments. The Heritage Museum advises this event is not suitable for children under 10.\n\nStanley said the library has a hidden staircase people will go through for the tour.\n\nThe Haunted Hills display has photos of Louiza Fox\u2019s grave, Thomas Carr\u2019s murder weapon that he used and new items to be displayed. Thomas Carr was the first person hanged in Belmont County for murder. His victim was the 13-year-old Fox, who is buried at Salem Cemetery in Egypt Valley.\n\nThere will be a lantern tour following at 6 p.m. Oct. 19, with the Spirit Seekers at the St. Clairsville library. This tour includes a walk along Main Street with Spirit Seekers teaching tourists about Sheriff Sam Dunfee, the only sheriff in Belmont County to be killed during active duty, his residence and death; Carr\u2019s burial; Frog Hollow; National Road Tavern and more.\n\nAlthough registration is full for the lantern walk, people can still join the waiting list and have a chance to enjoy the walk.\n\nThe next week, the Spirit Seekers will be at the Belmont County Heritage Museum again from 5:30-8 p.m. Oct. 24 for the annual Halloween Bash put on by the St. Clairsville Area Chamber of Commerce, where the Spirit Seekers will bring their paranormal investigative equipment for participants to use.\n\n\u201cI think the library is a great place for people to learn about local history,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cAnd people who maybe, even though we\u2019re right across the street from the library, maybe they\u2019ve never been in here.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Yvette Fielding's ghostly encounter in her mid-20s transformed her life\n\nUntil she was 26, former Blue Peter presenter Yvette Fielding didn\u2019t believe in the afterlife. But that all changed the night she awoke to find an eerie figure \u00adstanding at the end of the bed in her mother\u2019s house. She tells me: \u201cI awoke in the middle of the night to discover a young, Second World War soldier staring straight at me from the foot of the bed. It was petrifying.\u201d Even more terrifyingly, rather than being vaporous, the youthful figure \u2013 dressed in a brown military uniform with brass buttons, and sporting Brylcreemed hair and a sharp side parting \u2013 appeared to have formand substance. \u201cI burst into tears and ran screaming from the bedroom into my mum\u2019s room,\u201d Yvette, now 55, recalls. \u201cImagine, as a young woman, awaking to discover a man in your room. But although it was like looking at a solid object, he was only there from the waist up \u2013 his top half was hovering. I was sobbing, \u2018There\u2019s a ghost in the house\u2019.\u201d The experience was destined to change the shape of Yvette\u2019s life \u2013 revealing a new direction in her broadcasting career that continues to this day, as well as helping introduce her to her second husband, TV producer Karl Beattie. Most Haunted, the paranormal research series presented by Yvette and a gang of experts, and produced by Karl, is now filming its 26th season. Yvette explains that her compulsion for the paranormal turned from terror into fascination following a grim discovery made after her haunting experience. \u201cMum and I felt compelled to research the young man in uniform,\u201d she tells me. They started by talking to the neighbours. \u201cThere were only five houses in the road, and we discovered that a couple of them had seen exactly the same thing,\u201dshe explains. Things then became even stranger still when they dug deeper and spoke to anolder resident. \u201cBehind the houses was a wood, and beyond that, the Manchester to London \u00adrailway line. \u201cI spoke to a neighbour who said that during the war, the young soldiers were sent south by railway to fight, but one young conscript had thrown himself off the train as he didn\u2019t want to go, and was cut in half by the train.\u201d Convinced that this explained the apparition that had so alarmed her, fearturned into fascination. \u201cThat first-hand experience has now led me on a journey that has become such a huge passion, and it has actually changed my entire life,\u201d Yvette reflects. \u201cBefore this experience, I didn\u2019t believe in anything. I didn\u2019t believe in a God. I didn\u2019t believe in life after death and those feelings affected me in a negative way because when I had the usual share of awful times, as we all do, I would wonder what life is all about, why are we here, where did we come from and is that it when you\u2019re put in the ground at the end and it all goes black?\u201d\n\nYvette Fielding and husband Karl\n\nNow Yvette\u2019s latest children\u2019s book, about haunted castles, has just been published, mining her on-camera experiences and bringing them to life in spooky fashion for a brand new audience of young readers. And it was shortly after meeting Karl that she discovered he had also had a similar experience to her; a fact that proved to be deeply bonding. \u201cWhen I met my beautiful husband, he had had his own haunted experiences,\u201d she tells me. Karl takes over the tale: \u201cOne night, when I was about 10 and my brother was five, I saw a man wearing a fedora hat and dressed in a 1930s costume, leaning on my bedroom door frame.\u201d As with Yvette\u2019s visitor, he was similarly solid but faded over the next few minutes. Says Karl: \u201cI thought I may have dreamed it, but it was only in the morning when we got up for breakfast that my little brother said that he had got really scared in the night because there was a man leaning on the wall in a Humphrey Bogart outfit. He was so young that this detail made me think there had to be some truth to what we had both seen.\u201d When the couple, who have been married for 25 years and have a daughter, Mary, met on the set of BBC One\u2019s documentary series City Hospital, they soon found themselves sharing their experiences. Says Karl: \u201cYvette and I connected on so many levels when we met, and had this sense that we had met each other before and when I talked about this experience, she took me seriously. We were both used to people being sceptical.\u201d Yvette, who also has a son, Will, from a previous marriage, says that this led them to become \u00adincreasingly intrigued to the point that they came up with the idea for the TV series. Sheadds: \u201cWe were so passionate about the topic that we spent all our life savings making the pilot and for a while we couldn\u2019t pay the mortgage.\u201d\n\nTrending\n\nWorryingly, all the mainstream TV \u00adstations turned it down. \u201cChannel 5 even called us \u2018unprofessional\u2019 for delving into this genre,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut something in us kept pushing until the satellite station UK Living said yes.\u201d At the time, the station was losing viewers, but the couple were told \u201cthis might be just mad enough to work\u201d. Sixteen initial episodes were commissioned, and Yvette found herself launched professionally into the world of the paranormal. \u201cWe don\u2019t know all the answers and the only experts are those who have passed on,\u201d she says now. \u201cBut I definitely call myself a paranormal researcher.\u201d And as she gazes into the camera, often in the eerie black and white world created by heat-seeking night vision cameras, she says she never forgets the advice she was given as a 19-year-old presenting rookie by Biddy Baxter, the legendary Blue Peter producer. \u201cOne thing Biddy always said was that it is so important just to be yourself as a presenter. She said, \u2018Never, ever when you look in the camera, think of a lot of people. Just think of one, your best friend, and you are trying to talk to them\u2019.\u201d It\u2019s advice she continues to heed. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important for presenters to remember that. Audiences are not daft, they know who a genuine person is.\u201d\n\nCaron Keating, Mark Curry and Yvette Fielding on Blue Peter in 1995\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Their work was part of the \"Asteroid Discovery Campaign,\" supported by the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC).\n\nAs part of this initiative, amateur astronomers sought to identify new asteroids. Arslan and Esen successfully detected a celestial body in 2021, which was subsequently registered as a new asteroid by the IASC. This significant discovery also granted them the privilege of naming the asteroid.\n\nSignificance of discovery\n\nAy\u015fe Arslan shared her excitement with Anadolu Agency (AA), noting that after their application to the Asteroid Discovery Campaign was accepted, they began their observations using data sets provided to them. They utilized specialized software to analyze the data and submitted their reports to the Minor Planet Center of the IASC.\n\nAfter three years of awaiting confirmation, they received an email notifying them that the celestial body they discovered was the first asteroid identified by Turkish researchers. Arslan emphasized the scientific value of this discovery, stating, \"The identification of this asteroid marks the first time a celestial body has been discovered in the solar system by Turkish researchers, which is incredibly significant for both us and T\u00fcrkiye.\"\n\n\u00d6mer Selim Esen expressed his pride in their discovery, recalling, \"We discovered this asteroid three years ago. A long time has passed, but I still remember that moment vividly. It is very valuable to me.\" Driven by his curiosity about astronomy, Esen has been involved in various projects at BILSEM for seven years."

        "article_content": "Startups can qualify for several types of small business loans. As long as you have enough time in business and can meet other requirements, you can use startup loans for a wide range of business goals.\n\nWorking capital loan (business line of credit)\n\nA small business line of credit or \"working capital loan\" can be a great choice for small business startup loans. This type of business loan gives your startup a flexible line of credit that works in the same way as a small business credit card.\n\nMost working capital loans can be paid off in a flexible way (based on the lender's terms). This flexibility is especially important for startup loans, because it can help your growing business conserve cash when you need it, or replenish your available line of credit faster if you choose.\n\nSmall business term loan for startups\n\nWorking capital loans are often available in the form of a flexible revolving line of credit. But if your startup is ready to borrow a larger amount of funding for big goals like purchasing equipment or investing in new facilities, a small business term loan can give your startup long-term cash.\n\nHere's the biggest difference between a small business line of credit and a small business term loan: A small business line of credit is like a credit card, and a term loan is like a mortgage. Because small business term loans tend to have larger loan amounts, fixed monthly payments, and longer durations, term loans might also have more favorable APRs.\n\nSome small business term loans are harder for young companies to qualify for -- your startup might need to have at least two years in business before you can get the best rates on a small business term loan. And many small business term loans require the business owner to offer a personal guarantee, or put up collateral such as equipment or property owned by the business.\n\nSBA loans for startups\n\nSBA loans can be a good choice for startups because they're supported by the Small Business Administration (SBA). This government backing helps make SBA loans available to a wider range of businesses, including newer businesses, that might not qualify for traditional bank business loans. Even startup founders with bad credit can qualify for SBA loans.\n\nBe aware that with SBA loans for startups, the loan amounts might be smaller than you prefer, and the application process is not always fast. It might take a few months for your SBA startup loan application to get reviewed and approved. If your startup needs money sooner, the best fast small business loans for quick funding could be a better choice.\n\nEquipment financing for startups\n\nSome banks and lenders offer special business loans designed for purchasing equipment. Equipment financing for startups can help your company buy new computers, office furniture, machinery for a contracting business, professional kitchen appliances for a restaurant, and any other equipment that your business might need.\n\nSimilar to buying a car with an auto loan, some equipment loans will even use the newly purchased equipment as collateral to secure the loan -- which can help your business qualify for a lower APR."
