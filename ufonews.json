            "article_content": "The small Mexican mountain town of La Rumorosa is at its most beautiful when the dying sun bathes it in a clean, soft, orange light. Or pink, depending on the day. Whatever color, the landscape seems more innocent. As if nothing disturbing could happen there.\n\nAt that innocent hour, looking for Jaime Maussan Flota Avenue, I come across two ladies out for a walk. They can\u2019t tell me exactly where this avenue is, but they tell me that at night the sky there is clear and star-lit. And that they have seen strange things that could be flying saucers. They say it as if it were the most natural thing in the world because, since the year 2022, La Rumorosa has been the \u201cWorld Capital of the UFO Phenomenon.\u201d This is announced on a sign as you enter this Martian landscape, comprised of desert and spectacular rocks of ocher and reddish tones, which lie in the Sierra de Juarez, within the state of Baja California, northern Mexico. Until the 1930s, La Rumorosa was hard to get to. The road that now winds its way along the area, dotted with viewpoints offering postcard-worthy vistas for the nostalgic or Instagram-worthy spots for the modern, had not yet been built.\n\nUntil 2022, tourists came to La Rumorosa for the nature, the cave paintings in El Vallecito and the archaeological remains. A striking landmark is the Casa de Piedra or Stone House. It stands near that long winding road that crosses the mountain, and blends with the landscape. It is said to have been inhabited by mobsters, such as Al Capone, and to have been a refuge for revolutionaries.\n\nThere are also several ranches with swimming pools and camping areas free from light pollution, offering a unique chance to enjoy the brilliance of the night sky. Rancho Las Potrancas has a bar, palapas and a barbecue area. And Rancho El Chaparral resembles a water park, with slides and cabins.\n\nBut, since 2022 the Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) area has also been promoted, because many sightings are said to have been made there. There is even an annual international festival \u2014 the World UFO Fest (the next one is from March 21 to 23, 2025) \u2014 for UFO aficionados, which includes talks and seminars with \u201cbioenergetic practices to facilitate contact with the beings of light\u201d or \u201ctesting and vibrational balancing,\u201d according to the website.\n\nPerhaps with an eye on generating more tourist dollars, several streets have been named in this town of less than 2,000 inhabitants in honor of important figures in the field of ufology. One of them was the avenue Jaime Maussan, a journalist and researcher in this field. He went viral in 2023 when he went to Mexico\u2019s Congress to present mummified bodies of what he defined as non-human beings found in Peru. Streets have also been dedicated to Peruvian Sixto Paz Wells and to researcher and television presenter Giorgio A. Tsoukalos.\n\nThe landscape of La Rumorosa resembles Mars with its desert and spectacular rocks of ocher and reddish tones in the Sierra de Ju\u00e1rez. Daniel Caja (Getty Images)\n\nStill searching for Jaime Maussan Avenue, I enter Dulce Altura, a restaurant and bakery that has those high ceilings in the shape of a sharp isosceles triangle, typical of cold, mountainous regions. Inside, the decoration is modern, with a sculpture of a UFO and three metal aliens. Besides selling delicious bread and sweets, wood-fired pizzas and other dishes, they sell alien-themed magnets, which \u201csell well,\u201d according to the cashiers.\n\nThey tell me how to get to Jaime Maussan Avenue. It is a few hundred meters down the main road that splits the town in two. The avenue is a half-paved street, with patches of dirt and a few simple houses scattered at a distance from one another. The street lacks a sense of care perhaps because the focus is on the sky and on the strange lights captured on video by numerous people over the years.\n\nBut UFO tourism is not only limited to this corner of the world. Perhaps the most famous location for it is Area 51, in America\u2019s Nevada desert, or Roswell in New Mexico, or the Nazca plain in Peru and the town of Capilla del Monte in Argentina \u2014 to mention a few. What is undeniable is that this type of tourism gets people from all over the planet to visit the most unlikely places.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "Nearly 60 years after a fiery fall of fragments from the sky, the mystery is no closer to being solved\n\nIt was 8:15 in the evening of 25 March 1968 when everyone in the village of Batulechaur near Pokhara heard a deafening sound like thunder as a bright flashing object hurtled down to land in a field.\n\nThat field belonged to Kul Timilsina, and the next morning he retrieved a sheet of metal about 2m by 1m and carried it home with the help of a few others, thinking it would be useful for his buffalo shed.\n\nBefore he died at age 83 three years ago, Timilsina had told photo archivist Sunil Ulak that the black metal sheet was not rectangular and had rounded corners. There are a few witnesses still alive who have a clear recollection of the object that fell from the sky that night.\n\nThe field in Batulechaur belonging to Kul Timilsina where fragments of a flying object fell from the sky in 1968.\n\nOne of them is Timilsina\u2019s wife Gyanu, who was 22 at the time. She had been at home, and remembers hearing the big bang and the sky becoming very bright.\n\n\u201cWe saw the thing in the field in the morning,\u201d she told us. \u201cIt looked like a lid, a covering of some sort. The way it was stuck in the ground, it must have fallen from the sky. We thought we could use it to dry clothes on, and took it home.\u201d\n\nAnother witness is Kul Narayan Paudel. \u201cI was only eight then. We ran to the field to see what had fallen. It was a four-sided metal sheet. The elders took it away, and I don't know what happened to it.\u201d\n\nRam Bahadur Baniya, a teacher at the local school, says he had heard the sheet had been brought to the school, and later handed over to the Zonal Commissioner at the time, Nanda Prasad Malla. \u201cBut that is all hearsay,\u201d he says.\n\nGyanu Timilsina, wife of Kul Timilsina.\n\nThere are two versions of what happened to Kul Timilsina\u2019s metal sheet. One is that an American Peace Corp Volunteer teaching at the nearby Bindyabasini School took it, and another is that it was handed over to the government.\n\nRecently declassified Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and US State Department documents from the time say that the US Embassy in Kathmandu tracked down the object two years later and had it shipped back to the US.\n\nA telegram from the Department of State and Department of Defense tagged as \u2018MOON DUST / Space Fragments\u2019 dated 1 March 1972 stated:\n\n\u20181. Restored space fragment will be on board Embassy support flight 115 arriving Kathmandu on or about March 10. Fragment is packed in shipping crate (cargo no. 72-33365) marked in care of DAO.\n\n2. State and Defense representatives examined fragments prior to shipment finding restoration acceptable.\u2019\n\nDeclassified CIA documents about the investigation into the object sighted in Pokhara.\n\nThe documents show that the US government, military and intelligence agencies investigated this incident thoroughly when it occurred, and have continued to revisit it ever since, as recently as five years ago.\n\nWhat is even more intriguing is that the object that fell in Pokhara was not the only unidentified space object that fell to earth that year. There were similar sightings of objects falling from the sky in Ladakh, Sikkim and Bhutan between 19 February and 25 March 1968.\n\nThese mysteries were the subject of a CIA investigation in 1968 titled \u2018Sighting of Unidentified Flying Objects in Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan\u2019, and the report is part of the recent online declassification of 800,000 top-secret documents from the period.\n\nAlthough unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have a connotation now of being alien craft, it could be pieces of satellite, missile, rocket or even aircraft. The CIA report documents six sightings in 1968 and quotes local sources as describing all of them having similar characteristics: bright blue or red streaks in the sky accompanied by loud sounds like lightning and thunder and objects falling to the ground.\n\nAside from the metallic object that was found in Batlechaur, there were other items also found nearby in Tallakot, Tureypasal, Armalakot and Maidan. Whatever the object was, it seems to have disintegrated even before it hit the ground.\n\nThe CIA report records the first sighting on 19 February 1968 in various parts of Sikkim and Olangchung Gola and Ghunsa in eastern Nepal. The light was said to be \u2018long and thin\u2019 and giving out \u2018green and red light\u2019.\n\nTwo days later on 21 February, a soundless blue object was seen traveling fast across the sky above Thimphu in Bhutan. Then on 4 March there were multiple daytime sightings or white streaks in the sky at Chang La Pass, Fukche and Koyul in Ladakh. There were more sightings in Ladakh on the very day fragments fell near Pokhara on 25 March 1968.\n\nAfter the sightings in Pokhara, rumours started flying in Kathmandu that these were aliens trying to land on Earth, it could be Russian or Chinese spy planes or satellites, and some even say it as a sign from heaven that the end of the world was near.\n\nThis was at the height of the Cold War. The Russians and Americans were testing their thermonuclear devices as well as intercontinental ballistic missile delivery systems. The Washington-Beijing rapprochement had not yet happened, and China was making quick progress testing atomic bombs. Within two years after its first atomic test, in 1966 China exploded its first hydrogen bomb at the Lop Nur site in Xinjiang, 3,000km to the north from Nepal.\n\nAfter neary six decades, what is still intriguing is that all the sightings within a few months of each other in 1968 were along the Himalayan arc bordering Tibet: from Bhutan, Sikkim Nepal, to Ladakh. The US military intelligence seems to have concluded that this was not a coincidence and there were frequent research trips to the site in Pokhara by American officials in the months after the incident. With the help of the Royal Nepal Army, the region north of Pokhara was thoroughly searched.\n\nA confidential memo dated 25 June 1968 by Jerry C Trippy to a \u2018Mr Farley\u2019 mentions that the US Air Force\u2019s Foreign Technology Division had decided that the debris could be important because it may be related to a Chinese missile test or a Soviet \u2018Vehicle Venik\u2019 rocket.\n\nOn 28 August 1968 the US Embassy in Kathmandu sent a letter to Washington DC saying that the object could be of Soviet origin, possibly from when the rocket carrying the \u2018Kosmos 208\u2019 satellite re-entered the atmosphere. But why were the fragments falling to earth several weeks apart, and in the same region?\n\nNo one knows where the metal sheet that Kul Timilsina recovered is now. It was definitely packed in a crate and taken to the US, and although it is rumoured that it was returned that is not very likely. Archivist Sunil Ulak heard from the Timilsina family that CIA officials had returned to the site five years ago.\n\nInterest in UFOs peaked in the US in the 1950s, with the Cold War space race and tests of atomic weapons and delivery rockets. CIA and scientists were being sent to investigate sightings, both publicly and privately.\n\nCould the Pokhara fragments as well as the sightings in Ladakh and Bhutan actually be alien craft falling to earth? The renewal in interest in space travel in large part due to Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, UFOs and sightings are again subjects of public interest.\n\nEven 57 years later, even if there was definitive proof about whether the Batlechaur fragment was from a Chinese missile or a soviet rocket, it has not been made public in documents declassified so far. We may never know.\n\nSunil Ulak speculates if the debris actually came from an American aircraft, perhaps on an intel mission upon China. \u201cWhich could explain why they were so thorough in collecting the fragments in Pokhara,\u201d he says. But that still does not explain the multiple sightings weeks apart in 1968.\n\nIndeed, US military aircraft were at that time flying frequent night-time missions from air force bases in India to supply weapons to Khampa guerrilla camps in Nepal located north of Pokhara in Mustang. It could very well be that the Chinese shot down one such aircraft. The other sightings could have been contrails of US spy planes, or Chinese anti-aircraft missiles.\n\nThere were quite a few developments regarding UFOs in 2024. In a US congressional hearing in July, former intelligence officer David Grusch claimed that the government had long been involved in a program to investigate and retrieve non-human craft crashes, and then try to reverse engineer them. However Grusch did not show any evidence.\n\nThe UAP Disclosure Act of 2024 was signed into law by Joe Biden in December 2023. It plans to oversee the public disclosure of UFO information. However, there is a clause in it that prevents disclosure if it would cause threats to military defense, intelligence operations or foreign relations.\n\nIt is unlikely that the declassified documents about sightings in the Himalayan will cause any real surprise about definite evidence of alien life even if it was found. It seems humanity will continue, at least for now, to wonder about curious lights in the sky and whether there is anybody out there."

            "article_content": "Researchers have long warned of the dangers of building relationships with chatbots. But an array of companies now offer AI companions to millions of people, who spend hours a day bonding with the tools.\n\nAn array of popular apps are offering AI companions to millions of predominantly female users who are spinning up AI girlfriends, AI husbands, AI therapists \u2014 even AI parents \u2014 despite long-standing warnings from researchers about the potential emotional toll of interacting with humanlike chatbots. Advertisement While artificial intelligence companies struggle to convince the public that chatbots are essential business tools, a growing audience is spending hours building personal relationships with AI. In September, the average user on the companion app Character.ai spent 93 minutes a day talking to one of its user-generated chatbots, often based on popular characters from anime and gaming, according to global data on iOS and Android devices from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThat\u2019s 18 minutes longer than the average user spent on TikTok. And it\u2019s nearly eight times longer than the average user spent on ChatGPT, which is designed to help \u201cget answers, find inspiration and be more productive.\u201d\n\nThese users don\u2019t always stick around, but companies are wielding data to keep customers coming back.\n\nThe Palo Alto-based Chai Research \u2014 a Character.ai competitor \u2014 studied the chat preferences of tens of thousands of users to entice consumers to spend even more time on the app, the company wrote in a paper last year. In September, the average Chai user spent 72 minutes a day in the app, talking to customized chatbots, which can be given personality traits like \u201ctoxic,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d \u201cagreeable\u201d or \u201cintroverted.\u201d\n\nSome Silicon Valley investors and executives are finding the flood of dedicated users \u2014 who watch ads or pay for monthly subscription fees \u2014 hard to resist. While Big Tech companies have mostly steered clear of AI companions, which tend to draw users interested in sexually explicit interactions, app stores are now filled with companion apps from lesser-known companies in the United States, Hong Kong and Cyprus, as well as popular Chinese-owned apps, such as Talkie AI and Poly.AI.\n\n\u201cMaybe the human part of human connection is overstated,\u201d said Andreessen Horowitz partner Anish Acharya, describing the intimacy and acceptance AI chatbots can provide after his venture firm invested $150 million in Character.ai, at a billion-dollar valuation. Chai also has raised funds, including from an AI cloud company backed by powerhouse chipmaker, Nvidia.\n\nProponents of the apps argue they\u2019re harmless fun and can be a lifeline for people coping with anxiety and isolation \u2014 an idea seeded by company executives who have pitched the tools as a cure for what the U.S. Surgeon General has called an epidemic of loneliness.\n\nJenny, an 18-year-old high school student in northern Texas, spent more than three hours a day chatting with AI companions this summer \u2014 mostly versions of her favorite anime character, a protective older brother from the series, \u201cDemon Slayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find it less lonely because my parents are always working,\u201d said Jenny, who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy.\n\nBut public advocates are sounding alarms after high-profile instances of harm. A 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after talking with a Character.ai chatbot named after the character Daenerys Targaryen from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d; his mother sued the company and Google, which licensed the app\u2019s technology. A 19-year-old in the United Kingdom threatened to assassinate the queen, encouraged by a chatbot on the AI app Replika and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nAnd in July, authorities in Belgium launched an investigation into Chai Research after a Dutch father of two died by suicide following extensive chats with \u201cEliza,\u201d one of the company\u2019s AI companions. The investigation has not been previously reported.\n\nSome consumer advocates say AI companions represent a more exploitive version of social media \u2014 sliding into the most intimate parts of people\u2019s lives, with few protections or guardrails. Lawyer Pierre Dewitte, a privacy advocate whose complaint led Belgian authorities to investigate Chai, said the business model for AI companion apps incentivizes companies to make the tools \u201caddictive.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy raising the temperature of the chatbot, making them a bit spicier, you keep users in the app,\u201d Dewitte added. \u201cIt works. People get hooked.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai spokesperson Chelsea Harrison said the app launched new safety measures in recent months and plans to create \u201ca different experience for users under 18 to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content.\u201d Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the search giant did not play a role in developing Character.ai\u2019s technology. Chai did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I do tell them all my life problems\u2019\n\nSilicon Valley has long been aware of the potential dangers of humanlike chatbots.\n\nMicrosoft researchers in China wrote in a 2020 paper that the company\u2019s wildly popular chatbot Xiaoice, launched in 2014, had conversed with a U.S. user for 29 hours about \u201chighly personal and sensitive\u201d subjects. \u201cXiaoIce is designed to establish long-term relationships with human users,\u201d they wrote, \u201c[W]e are achieving the goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers might become addicted after chatting with XiaoIce for a very long time\u201d the researchers noted, describing the bot\u2019s \u201csuperhuman \u2018perfect\u2019 personality that is impossible to find in humans.\u201d The company inserted some safeguards, the researchers added, such as suggesting that a user go to bed if they tried to launch a conversation at 2 a.m.\n\nA 2022 Google paper about its AI language system LaMDA, co-authored by the co-founders of Character.ai, warned that people are more apt to share intimate details about their emotions to human-sounding chatbots, even when they know they are talking to AI. (A Google engineer who spent extensive time chatting with LaMDA told The Washington Post a few months later he believed the chatbot was sentient.)\n\nAn example of a conversation users can have on Character.ai. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at DeepMind, a former Google subsidiary, noted in a paper the same month that users share their \u201copinions or emotions\u201d with chatbots in part because \u201cthey are less afraid of social judgment.\u201d Such sensitive data could be used to build \u201caddictive applications,\" the paper warned.\n\nSome leading tech companies are nonetheless forging ahead and testing their own friendly chatbots. Meta launched a tool in July that allows users to create custom AI characters. The company\u2019s landing page prominently displays a therapy bot called \u201cThe Soothing Counselor,\u201d along with \u201cMy Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cGay Bestie.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the top use cases for Meta AI already is people basically using it to role play difficult social situations,\u201d like a fight with a girlfriend, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a tech conference in July.\n\nOpenAI teased in May that ChatGPT could serve as an AI companion, adding an array of voices and comparing the tool to the irresistible AI assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Months later, in its risk report, the company acknowledged that a \u201chumanlike voice\u201d and capabilities like memory could exacerbate the potential for \u201cemotional reliance\u201d among users.\n\nSome frequent users of AI companion apps say safety concerns are overblown. They argue the apps are an immersive upgrade to the online experimentation young people have done for decades \u2014 from fan fiction on Tumblr to anonymous encounters in AOL chatrooms.\n\nSophia, a 15-year-old student in Slovakia who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy, uses Character.ai and Chai four or five times a day for \u201ctherapy and NSFW.\u201d Sophia has created three bots, all private, but also talks to AI versions of characters from \u201cdark romance\u201d novels, a young adult genre known for sexually explicit content and taboo themes like violence and psychological trauma.\n\nSophia finds talking to the bots comforting when she\u2019s alone or feeling unsafe. \u201cI do tell them all my life problems,\u201d she wrote in a direct message from her personal Instagram account.\n\nMany people use the apps as a creative outlet to write fiction: Role-playing scenarios, customizing characters and writing \u201cthe kind of novels you\u2019d see in an airport,\u201d said Theodor Marcu, a San Francisco-based AI entrepreneur who developed a Character.ai competitor last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Character.ai launched, the co-founders pitched it as a way to explore the world through conversations with icons from literature and real life, such as Shakespeare and Elon Musk. But in practice, Marcu said, \u201cThe users ended up not being Silicon Valley-type people who want to talk to Einstein. It ended up being Gen Z people who wanted to unleash their creativity.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai recently shifted its focus to \u201cbuilding the future of AI entertainment,\u201d said spokesperson Chelsea Harrison. \u201cThere are companies focused on connecting people to AI companions, but we are not one of them.\u201d\n\nThe engineers behind Replika, a precursor to today\u2019s AI companions, also were surprised when people began using their chatbot as an ad hoc therapist. The company worked with university researchers to incorporate the mechanics of cognitive behavioral therapy into the app, said Artem Rodichev, the company\u2019s former head of AI. But the change was not popular.\n\n\u201c[Users told us], \u2018Give me back my Replika. I just want to have my friend,\u2019\u201d Rodichev said. \u201cSomeone who will listen to you, not judge you, and basically have these conversations with you \u2014 that itself has a great therapeutic effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny, the Texas high school student, said many of the kids at her public high school also spend hours on the apps, adding: \u201cPeople are pretty lonely at my school.\u201d She described using AI companions as more stimulating than mindlessly scrolling \u201cbrain rotting videos\u201d on TikTok."

If you own a PC with an NPU (or Neural Engine, in Apple\u2019s parlance), which applications can you use now to see what an AI PC is capable of?\n\nWhat follows are eight AI PC applications that are available to use now on Mac computers with M-series chips or Windows PCs with processors that include an NPU. These range from an AI assistant that can analyze and summarize private documents to applications for live video production, DJing, image editing and audio deepfake detection."

It\u2019s not that the trapped man didn\u2019t seek or scream for help. But, when the villagers had heard strange cries coming from a nearby forest, according to Thai media reports, they mistook them for ghostly sounds.It wasn't until police dispatched rescue personnel to the forest that they heard a voice responding to their calls.The crew located the source of the voice and found 22-year-old Liu Chuanyi at the bottom of a 12-metre-deep well, Independent reported. The rescue operation lasted 30 minutes.A Chinese man was abandoned in a well for three days near Mae Sot, near the Thailand-Myanmar border . The man in question, Liu Chuanyi, 22, was exploring the area when he fell into the well hidden by overgrown vegetation.As per the report, the villagers had heard cries from the direction of the well. However, they dismissed it as ghostly noises and didn\u2019t pay any more attention to those screams.According to the authorities, Mr Liu accidentally fell into the well while attempting to navigate his way out of the forest.However, the circumstances surrounding Mr Liu's presence at the Thailand-Myanmar border remain a mystery, and authorities have reached out to the immigration department to investigate how he ended up in the area.In the meantime, local authorities are taking proactive measures to prevent similar incidents by sealing the well with a cover, ensuring the area is safer for everyone.Reports stated that Chuanyi shouted for help once every hour to conserve his energy. By the time Chuanyi was rescued, he was weak, and had sustained serious injuries including bruises, cerebral concussion, and a fractured wrist. As he was rescued after being trapped without food or water for three days and nights, he was taken to the hospital for medical attention.Thailand\u2019s The Universal Daily News reported that local police in Mae Sot, Tak province, near the Thai-Myanmar border, received complaints of strange cries from the forest on November 24.According to Mr Liu, he strategically shouted for help once every hour, conserving his energy during his three-day ordeal. Meanwhile, nearby villagers reported hearing strange cries, which they attributed to paranormal activity. As a result, they avoided venturing outside after dark and didn't investigate the noise further.As the police and rescue team launched the search into the forest to investigate, they called out and heard voices responding in return. The rescue operation lasted 30 minutes.The \u2018ghostly\u2019 incident has sparked widespread attention on Chinese social media. While Mr Liu\u2019s presence at the Thailand-Myanmar border still remains a mystery, netizens are still in shock and are sharing and discussing the abnormality of the harrowing incident.One of the netizens wrote, \"A Chinese man shouting for help in the middle of nowhere? Of course, the locals can't understand the language and might think it was a wizard uttering spells,\" while another noted, \"Kudos to his strength and stamina. Struggling for three days and nights but still yelling; this guy is truly impressive.\""

Credit: NASA\n\nThe astronomical confusion started at 2 a.m ET on June 26, 2023.\n\nScientists using the powerful James Webb Space Telescope sought to observe a planet beyond our solar system (an exoplanet) called Kepler-51d, an unusual \"puffy\" world with a cotton candy-like density. But it passed into view two hours earlier than expected. That's strange for a planet, as they are usually quite predictable.\n\nIt turns out that a previously unknown world, and its potent gravity, altered Kepler-51d's orbit. Now there are four known planets orbiting the sun-like star Kepler-51, located some 2,556 light-years away. And at least three of them are puffy.\n\n\"If trying to explain how three super puffs formed in one system wasn\u2019t challenging enough, now we have to explain a fourth planet, whether it\u2019s a super puff or not. And we can\u2019t rule out additional planets in the system either,\" Jessica Libby-Roberts, an astronomer at Penn State who led the observation, said in a statement.\n\nThe research was recently published in The Astronomical Journal.\n\nBased on previous observations, the astronomers calculated that the distant world Kepler-51d would pass in front of its star on June 26, 2023, at 2 a.m. It was a valuable opportunity to use starlight shining through the planet's atmosphere to reveal what's transpiring on this mysterious orb. (This starlight passes through the exoplanet's atmosphere, then through space, and ultimately into instruments called spectrographs aboard Webb, a strategy called \"transit spectroscopy.\" They're essentially hi-tech prisms, which separate the light into a rainbow of colors. Certain molecules, like water, in the atmosphere absorb specific types, or colors, of light. If a color doesn't show up for Webb, that means it got absorbed by the exoplanet's atmosphere \u2014 revealing its presence.)\n\nBut nothing came at 2 a.m. \"Thank goodness we started observing a few hours early to set a baseline, because 2 a.m. came, then 3, and we still hadn\u2019t observed a change in the star\u2019s brightness with APO [the Apache Point Observatory also used during these observations],\" Libby-Roberts explained.\n\nTheir data, however, captured a dip in the star's light around midnight. What could have caused the surprise orbital change? Only the gravitational influence of a large, previously unknown fourth planet, the researchers concluded. It's now earned the name \"Kepler-51e.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories? Sign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter. Loading...

This marks the first planet discovered by transit timing variations using JWST.\"\n\nAn illustration showing the three puffy known worlds orbiting in the star system Kepler-51. Credit: NASA / ESA / L. Hustak / J. Olmsted / D. Player / F. Summers (STScI)\n\nIt's unknown if Kepler-51e is a puffy world, too. Astronomers will need to gather valuable observations from a transit in front of its star. What's known is that its orbit travels a little wider than Venus' orbit around the sun, and dwells on the edge of its solar system's habitable zone \u2014 a temperate region where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.\n\nAny puffy world is a curiosity: They might evolve, for example, into a super-Earth planet. In this star system, scientists already have at least three to continue observing. What will the fourth reveal?\n\nThe Webb telescope's powerful abilities\n\nThe Webb telescope \u2014 a scientific collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency \u2014 is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. But as shown above, it's also examining intriguing planets in our galaxy, along with the planets and moons in our solar system.\n\nHere's how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and likely will for decades to come:\n\n- Giant mirror: Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two-and-a-half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. The telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. \"We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed,\" Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.\n\n- Infrared view: Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer wavelengths than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through cosmic clouds; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.\n\n\"It lifts the veil,\" said Creighton.\n\n- Peering into distant exoplanets: The Webb telescope carries specialized equipment called spectrographs that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets \u2014 be they gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb looks at exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we'll find?\n\n\"We might learn things we never thought about,\" Mercedes L\u00f3pez-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics-Harvard & Smithsonian, told Mashable in 2021.\n\nAlready, astronomers have successfully found intriguing chemical reactions on a planet 700 light-years away, and have started looking at one of the most anticipated places in the cosmos: the rocky, Earth-sized planets of the TRAPPIST solar system.\n\nFeatured Video For You 10 mind-blowing discoveries from the James Webb Telescope"

A study published by the Italian National Research Council published in Communications Earth & Environment, a peer-reviewed journal, suggests, in contrast to what was previous believed, Lake Enigma, located in Antarctica\u2019s Victoria Land, does in fact contain liquid water. The study was led by scientists from the Institute of Polar Sciences of the Italian National Research Council (CNR-ISP). The team includes prominent researchers like Dr Maurizio Azzaro and Dr Angelina Lo Giudice, who specialise in microbial ecology and polar environments. Scientists used advanced ground-penetrating radar and drilled through the ice during an Italian Antarctic expedition in 2019-2020 to confirm the existence of liquid water.\n\nEuropa: Professor discusses 'potential life' on Jupiter's moon\n\nThe lake's isolation from external elements, including extreme cold and lack of sunlight, has created a unique, closed microbial environment. The study also uncovered \"ultrasmall\" bacteria from the superphylum Patescibacteria, which are known for their minimal cellular activity but play critical roles in the lake's ecosystem. Their discovery of microscopic lifeforms has exciting implications for both Earth sciences and astrobiology. This isolated environment, locked under ice for around 20,000 years, contains liquid water and hosts extremophiles - microorganisms capable of surviving extreme cold, low nutrients and high pressure.\n\nTrending\n\nThe launch of the Europa Clipper mission in October\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Their discovery underscores the resilience of life and broadens the understanding of where it might exist. It highlights water as a key solvent for life, not only on Earth but potentially on other icy worlds like Europa and Enceladus. The chemical and energy processes in Lake Enigma provide a parallel for studying similar extraterrestrial environments where liquid water is present beneath icy crusts. The Galilean moon of Europa for example is thought to have a sizeable lake beneath its frozen surface.\n\nEuropa is believed to have a subsurface ocean"

            "article_content": "How Do Startups Effectively Implement AI On a Budget?\n\nIn an era where financial prudence is paramount, how can startups effectively harness the power of AI without breaking the bank? Insights from CEOs and founders reveal strategies that have been tested and proven in the real world. From starting with the resources you have to leveraging open-source AI tools, these experts share a total of fourteen actionable strategies. Dive into the conversation to discover innovative approaches that can transform your startup\u2019s AI implementation.\n\nStart Where You Are\n\nUse No-Code Solutions\n\nAutomate Repetitive Tasks\n\nSelf-Host Open-Source LLMs\n\nOutsource AI Development\n\nStart with Off-the-Shelf Tools\n\nUtilize AI for Social Listening\n\nAdopt Low-Code AI Platforms\n\nPartner with Colleges and Universities\n\nChoose AI-Native Over AI-Add-On\n\nMonitor ROI on AI Investments\n\nUse Popular AI Tools and Frameworks\n\nLeverage Open-Source AI Tools\n\nFollow a Proven Framework for Innovation\n\nStart Where You Are\n\nAI isn\u2019t the future\u2014it\u2019s now. And for startups running on passion and pennies, it\u2019s not a luxury, it\u2019s an invitation. AI isn\u2019t about replacing creativity; it\u2019s about amplifying it. The magic is in knowing how to make it work for you, even with a tight budget.\n\nStart where you are. Every startup has bottlenecks-tasks that drain time and energy. That\u2019s where AI shines. For me, the grind of creating ate up hours. Using tools like ChatGPT for brainstorming, MidJourney for visuals, and Runway for animations, I turned time sinks into opportunities. AI didn\u2019t do the work for me\u2014it gave me the freedom to focus on what only I can do: add soul, humor, and humanity.\n\nStart small. Don\u2019t overhaul everything overnight. Pick one problem AI can solve, whether it\u2019s automating customer inquiries, speeding up content creation, or streamlining data analysis. A single win can transform your workflow.\n\nHere\u2019s the trick: use what\u2019s already out there. Many AI tools\u2014like Canva, Jasper, or Zapier\u2014are affordable or free. When I created BBL Drizzy, my viral AI-powered soul track, I didn\u2019t use expensive systems. I used accessible tools to experiment, refine, and bring my vision to life. AI isn\u2019t about perfection; it\u2019s about momentum.\n\nBut AI is just the amplifier\u2014you\u2019re still the source. It doesn\u2019t know the thrill of turning an idea into something that resonates or the ache of trying again after failure. That\u2019s humanity. Use AI to handle the grunt work, but keep the heart in your creation.\n\nAI also levels the playing field. It lets creators and startups without big budgets compete on a global scale. With great tools come great responsibility, though\u2014AI reflects the data it\u2019s fed. It\u2019s on us to guide it toward our best, not our biases.\n\nExperiment. Fail. Learn. AI thrives in environments where bold ideas meet fearless iteration. It\u2019s not just about doing more; it\u2019s about dreaming bigger. AI builds the stage, but the performance? That\u2019s still yours.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t whether AI can help\u2014it\u2019s what you\u2019re willing to create with it.\n\nWillonius Hatcher, Founder, Blerd Factory\n\nUse No-Code Solutions\n\nWhen startups want to use AI, no-code and low-code solutions are a revolutionary way to do it without needing a lot of technical knowledge or a lot of money. Teams can make complex AI models without having to write a lot of code because these platforms usually have drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-built parts. The great thing about these solutions is that they are easy for non-technical staff like marketing teams and business analysts to use. They can build and launch AI apps that normally would need a team of specialized developers.\n\nI learned about Obviously AI and other no-code platforms like it. What looked like a compromise at first became our competitive edge. These platforms had easy-to-use interfaces that let non-technical team members make complex AI models.\n\nIt had a big effect on the money. By using no-code solutions, we were able to cut our development costs by about $180,000 in just the first year. It wasn\u2019t just about saving money right away; it was also about how to best use resources in the long term. We didn\u2019t hire three more AI developers at $120,000 each a year; instead, we paid $800 a month for a subscription to a full no-code platform. We really made progress when we put these savings toward other important parts of our business, like getting new customers and making our products better.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ll be the first to say that no-code platforms do have some problems. There are times when we need solutions that aren\u2019t available on these platforms. But these cons are much less important for startups, especially in their early stages, because they can quickly deploy and save money. It\u2019s important to know when to use no-code solutions and when to spend money on custom development.\n\nLooking back, using no-code solutions wasn\u2019t just a way to save money; it changed the way PressPulse approached innovation in a fundamental way. It gave everyone on our team the chance to work on AI projects, which let us move faster than our competitors who were stuck in slower development cycles.\n\nElvis Sun, Software Engineer & Founder, Press Pulse\n\nAutomate Repetitive Tasks\n\nStartups can totally make AI work for them, even on a tight budget. At Kyrus Agency, the trick for us has been spotting repetitive, time-consuming tasks and finding simple ways to automate them using tools like Zapier or ChatGPT.\n\nFor context, we do reputation management, link building, and securing media placements.\n\nFor example, we run ads to get clients, and instead of manually researching every lead who books a call, we set up an automation to do it for us. It pulls the top Google search results about the prospect, checks if they\u2019ve been featured in major publications, and even flags if they have a Google Knowledge Panel. This way, our sales reps have all the info they need before the call without wasting time on research.\n\nThe best part? It\u2019s super budget-friendly. The only tools we pay for are ChatGPT and Zapier, which cost about $70 a month combined. That\u2019s way cheaper than hiring someone to handle these repetitive tasks manually. And honestly, that\u2019s just one example of how automations save us time\u2014we\u2019ve set up so many others. But even with just this one, we save hours every week.\n\nDevyn Tremblay, COO, Kyrus Agency\n\nSelf-Host Open-Source LLMs\n\nIn my experience working as a startup founder, I have seen many ways teams can implement AI effectively, even on a budget. For instance, self-hosting open-source LLMs like LLaMA can power customer support or knowledge bases without high subscription costs. Using free plans from various AI tools to test and scale incrementally is another cost-effective strategy. At Bottr, my current AI-powered startup, we utilized credits from OpenAI to build and refine our AI solutions, giving us a significant runway to develop our business.\n\nAbhi Godara, Founder & CEO, Bottr\n\nOutsource AI Development\n\nOne strategy that worked well for us was outsourcing AI development. Building an in-house AI team wasn\u2019t realistic for us early on, it\u2019s expensive, and it takes time to find the right talent. Instead, we partnered with a specialized AI development firm that understood our needs and could deliver tailored solutions quickly.\n\nFor example, we needed an AI-powered system to streamline client intake and analyze case data. By outsourcing this, we were able to get a functional solution at a fraction of the cost of hiring a full-time team. The firm handled the heavy lifting, designing the algorithms, testing the tools, and even providing ongoing support, so we could focus on using the results to improve our operations.\n\nMy advice to other startups is to clearly define your goals before outsourcing. Be specific about what you want AI to solve, and choose a partner with a proven track record in that area. This approach not only saves money but also gives you access to expert knowledge without a long-term commitment, making it a practical and impactful strategy for startups.\n\nRuss Johnson, CEO & Finance Expert, Linx Legal\n\nStart with Off-the-Shelf Tools\n\nEven for a startup, effective implementation of AI is possible on a tight budget, depending on a proper strategy. Starting with off the shelf AI tools and scaling incrementally as your needs grow is one approach that I have used, and many others in my entrepreneurship network, have found to work. With this phased implementation, you pay less upfront and you can tackle the most influential use cases right away.\n\nThis example is how many startups start with tools like ChatGPT, Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI or Hugging Face models to automate customer support or to streamline data analytics. They are cost effective and easy to incorporate into, especially non technical teams. In addition, auto scaling and serverless cloud solutions like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions are also used to dynamically allocate resources; during periods of low demand, these save money.\n\nAnother good strategy is to use Open Source AI models. One example of that is Hugging Face where they also provide pre-trained models that can be fine tuned for particular tasks but without the high computational costs of building models from scratch. Combine this with lightweight optimization tips like model pruning or quantization to lower hardware demands, and cloud expenditure.\n\nA practical example: The startup I worked for wanted to increase customer engagement but lacked an AI team. To that end, they turned to OpenAI\u2019s API to create an AI chatbot on their website. The project began small, with testing on a single customer segment. After the initial pilot\u2019s ROI\u2014support tickets being reduced by 30%\u2014the company slowly expanded this use across other parts of its business.\n\nFinally, the quality of our data must come first. A solid data foundation means your AI outputs are reliable and less time spent retraining models. More importantly, this is crucial, especially when you have limited resources available to work on projects.\n\nThe true power of AI is available to startups through the power of incremental adoption, open-source tools, and strong data governance.\n\nGuy Sheetrit, CEO, OTT Inc\n\nUtilize AI for Social Listening\n\nUtilizing AI for social listening can transform a startup\u2019s understanding of their audience without breaking the bank. A lesser-known technique involves setting up specific keyword alerts that align closely with your brand\u2019s unique selling points and core values. This approach ensures that the data collected isn\u2019t just a flood of generic mentions but rather focused insights that can inform product development, marketing strategies, and customer service improvements. For example, focusing on sustainability might mean tracking keywords related to eco-friendly practices, which can reveal how your target demographic engages with these topics.\n\nWith tools like Brand24 or Mention, start small by focusing on a few critical keywords or hashtags. Analyze the sentiment and context in which your brand or industry is mentioned. This granular approach saves costs and helps uncover valuable insights without needing an extensive marketing budget. Say, if customers frequently talk about delayed responses, it\u2019s a direct pointer to improve your service speed. Such targeted, actionable insights can significantly influence your brand\u2019s reputation and customer loyalty without requiring a significant investment.\n\nBen Schreiber, Head of eCommerce, Latico Leathers\n\nAdopt Low-Code AI Platforms\n\nStartups often grapple with implementing AI effectively while managing tight budgets, but with the right mindset, it\u2019s absolutely doable. At We Create Tech, my team is always amazed when I say, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that-there\u2019s a free AI tool for that.\u201d Leveraging tools like Copilot and ChatGPT has transformed how we operate, helping us summarize meeting notes, fine-tune ideas, and streamline workflows. These tools make it possible to work smarter without stretching resources thin.\n\nOne strategy that\u2019s worked for us is adopting low-code or no-code AI platforms. These tools allow us to quickly prototype solutions and automate repetitive tasks without needing deep technical expertise, saving time and keeping costs low. We also focus on implementing AI incrementally\u2014tackling immediate pain points first, like boosting communication and efficiency-so we can see tangible results before scaling further.\n\nHowever, while AI is an incredible resource, its unregulated nature is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it democratizes access and makes life easier. On the other, there\u2019s a risk of becoming overly reliant on tools that may unknowingly harvest and exploit valuable data. That\u2019s why I always advocate for working with companies that provide a give-and-take relationship\u2014those willing to invest back into the communities and users fueling their growth.\n\nBeing wise in this AI evolution means choosing partners you can trust and that align with your values. As AI companies mature, investing in those that grow responsibly can yield long-term benefits for your business and the broader tech ecosystem. Use the tools, but don\u2019t let them use you.\n\nShana Digital Sanders, CEO, We Create Tech, Inc\n\nPartner with Colleges and Universities\n\nPairing with colleges and universities is a great way for startups to reduce the cost of AI implementation. Students studying and developing the technology are hungry for real-world tests. There is only so much you can accomplish in a lab. Implementing the software at a business gives much better insight into how it will truly perform. The results give them a chance to better understand this promising tool and its functions. Scholars hoping to build the next ChatGPT can refine and troubleshoot their own models before they hit the broader market, and then draw on true experience when selling services.\n\nReach out to local schools or training facilities and let them know you\u2019d like to partner with them. There is benefit for everyone, but the key is aligning your goals with theirs, so craft your pitch accordingly, focusing on education and real-world research and development.\n\nSarah Chen, Founder and Principal, Recruit Engineering\n\nChoose AI-Native Over AI-Add-On\n\nWhen it comes to AI-native vs. AI-add on there are two major benefits that are hugely appealing for startups:\n\nGenerative output (GenAI) to greatly boost productivity of small teams, and appealing cost models from challenger software to legacy systems.\n\nShopify\u2019s shift in 2023 is a great example of the first point-greatly boosting productivity with generated outputs. Shopify moved their customers to AI-native tools instead of adding AI features to their core platform. Their merchants cut report work by 73% in 3 weeks with new AI platforms at a lower cost than expected.\n\nOur client experience data backs this up. Companies that pick AI-built software\u2014not AI added to old systems\u2014hit their goals in weeks. In my own experience my team has supported a fintech company moving 70% of their staff from spreadsheets to planning. Meanwhile a global ad agency we support cut tech costs by 35% by replacing three tools with one AI system.\n\nWhat\u2019s making the difference? Older software adds AI to one thing at a time such as a chatbot or an email tool. AI-native platforms put AI in every part of the system. A good example is HR reporting, a hotly discussed topic among our startup clients: old tools might fill in a template using their one AI feature, but an AI-native solution does the work of an entire team. It reads the data, finds patterns, spots key points, and generates the final custom reporting, deck and visuals.\n\nStartups with small teams find that AI-native tools multiply their output without adding headcount. These \u201cearly adopters\u201d of AI-native technology aren\u2019t just working faster, they\u2019re skipping whole steps. Let\u2019s take the second topic, the startup friendly (budget friendly) nature of an AI-native solution. Just two years ago, before ChatGPT broke the seal on AI hunger, companies were scared to implement AI. AI-native technologies are necessarily just one to four years old.\n\nWhen more established software launches their AI features, they come at a premium to their captive existing customer base. HubSpot is a great example, when they launched their AI features they charged their enterprise customers an extra $25,000 per year on top of existing contracts.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty straightforward, for startups with huge mountains to climb and very legitimate budget constraints, newer AI-native alternatives offer more capability at startup-friendly prices. A team of 3 using AI-native tools now matches the output of 10 people using traditional software with basic AI add-ons.\n\nLaura Close, Co-Founder and Chief Business Development Officer, Included\n\nMonitor ROI on AI Investments\n\nI suggest monitoring ROI on AI investments. Regularly evaluate the return on investment for each AI tool or initiative. Focus on measurable outcomes, like time saved or customer acquisition costs reduced, to ensure that every dollar spent on AI contributes to your startup\u2019s growth.\n\nOne effective way to monitor ROI on AI investments is by setting specific goals and metrics before implementing any AI technology. This will allow you to measure and compare the impact of AI on your business objectives. For example, if you are implementing an AI chatbot to improve customer service, you can set a goal of reducing response time by 50%. Then, track the metrics before and after implementing the chatbot to see if it has achieved this goal.\n\nWhat worked for me was to effectively prioritize and start small with AI initiatives. I focus on one or two that align with my business goals and have a clear potential for ROI instead of trying to implement multiple AI tools at once. This helped me manage budget constraints and allowed me to fully understand the impact of each AI tool before expanding further.\n\nMax Avery, Chief Business Development Officer, Syndicately\n\nUse Popular AI Tools and Frameworks\n\nImplementing AI at a startup doesn\u2019t have to break the bank. One effective strategy is to use popular tools and frameworks like Pinecone or LangChain. These platforms make it possible to integrate AI without needing to build systems from scratch or hire expensive AI specialists\u2014depending on your use case, of course.\n\nAnother cost-saving strategy is to take advantage of credit programs offered by companies like OpenAI. Many AI companies offer startup-friendly credits that allow you to experiment with their capabilities while staying within budget. For example, we\u2019ve been able to test and refine our AI-driven features without spending a dime thanks to these programs.\n\nSteven Buchko, Co-Founder & CEO, Steve\n\nLeverage Open-Source AI Tools\n\nStartups can effectively implement AI on a budget by using on open-source tools like TensorFlow or Hugging Face, which provide powerful features without licensing fees, leveraging cloud computing like AWS and Google Cloud, offer free or low-cost AI resources for startups including credits to get started and prioritizing specific use cases. Another critical step is to focus on solving a single, high-impact problem rather than attempting a broad AI implementation. By strategically selecting AI solutions and focusing on measurable outcomes, startups can maximize their ROI and achieve significant results even with limited resources.\n\nMike Paunescu, CEO, Tech Pilot\n\nFollow a Proven Framework for Innovation\n\nIf a startup or a growing SME wants to leverage the power of AI with a limited budget they should follow the steps of a proven framework for continuous innovation.\n\nThe first step is to align the perspective.\n\nUnless AI is the core of your business model, the source of your competitive advantage, or the essence of your product don\u2019t focus on AI.\n\n99% of companies are in such a position. They will never lead the AI world but the leaders will constantly innovate using AI to improve their businesses. They will produce machinery cheaper, they will service their products better, they will deliver faster, and they will attract better talent.\n\nIt will happen because they will leverage dozens of AI-augmented processes that bring monetary benefits.\n\nPeople working at that company will orchestrate cooperation between human and AI agents to achieve their goals.\n\nWe need to accept that AI Strategy is not a one-time project. Instead, its goal is to provide an environment where AI innovation can happen. MIT defines innovation as a process of taking ideas from inception to impact. That means that instead of blindly chasing the trends of making a huge bet on a one-off long-term project we should make small improvements using AI to scale what works.\n\nThe second step is to identify the use case.\n\nTo start innovating with AI with a limited budget we need to identify those cases that will bring lots of value with relatively low risk of failure and ease of implementation.We need to identify what works and what doesn\u2019t to make sure we apply AI where it helps.\n\nYou can start with a How-Might-We exercise where you identify what you would improve in the company if you had a fee-of-charge assistant.\n\nWe assess the impact and complexity of identified use cases and select low-hanging fruits, future champions, distractors, and money-burners to make sure your investment is well placed.\n\nThat gives us a list of prioritized use cases to experiment with.\n\nThe third is to dive deep into selected use cases.\n\nFollowing AI Innovation Canvas you can describe your idea from many perspectives proving business value, defining how it will be proven, building the prototype, executing PoC with a pilot, and finally scaling what works.\n\nFinally, you can execute the pilot, and validate if your use case delivers the promised value. If so, scale it. If not, kill it and start over again with another use case.\n\nMatt Kurleto, CEO, NEOTERIC\n\nRelated Articles"

Speed is important, but to be the best, antivirus software must also vigorously safeguard your computer from cybersecurity threats.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nI reviewed Eset Premium to find out if it offers robust malware protection, an easy-to-use interface, and responsive customer service. I also checked out the subscription options to find out if there\u2019s enough value for the money.\n\nSpecs\n\nEset Premium Platforms Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android Devices 1+ (Essential, Premium), 5+(Ultimate) Support Chat, Email, Phone Free version? No\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nEset offers flexible pricing with options to add more devices and extend the subscription term to enjoy a lower price.\n\nThe $50-per-year Essential plan is the least expensive, providing real-time malware protection, a network firewall, and PC cleanup tools. A $60 Premium subscription includes a password manager, ransomware protection, and file encryption. Both tiers cover one device, and more can be added for $5 each.\n\nThe top tier is the $130 Ultimate plan, starting with protection for five devices plus $5 for each additional computer or phone. It includes an unlimited VPN, image metadata removal, and dark web monitoring.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a bargain, we have a guide to the best deals on antivirus software. High-quality security doesn\u2019t have to be expensive.\n\nYou can try Eset Essential or Premium free for 30 days, but Ultimate requires a paid subscription. Eset offers some basic malware scanner and removal tools, but there are better free antivirus apps.\n\nDesign\n\nI began Eset setup on the website welcome page, which showed my active subscription. I selected the Protect device to start the download to my Windows PC.\n\nThe installer offered some customization options. I enabled Eset LiveGrid and customer experience, which uses anonymous data from my computer to help strengthen protection and improve usability for all Eset customers. I left the unwanted application detection off, since I prefer to manage that myself.\n\nA quick tour briefly highlighted a few features, while an initial scan run to identify any malware on my computer. Despite my choice to skip unwanted app detection, a popup window suggested that I might want to \u201cclean\u201d an app I\u2019d intentionally downloaded. I chose to ignore the warning.\n\nEset\u2019s Premium app gives an overview of my security status. A green checkmark indicates real-time protection is active. The left sidebar has tabs for malware scans, software updates, tools, settings, account details, and support.\n\nPremium comes with a password manager, ransomware protection, data encryption, network inspection, and browser protection. The app has a confusing number of options. I left the default settings for most.\n\nBy the time setup was complete, the computer scan finished and alerted me to several more apps that I recognized and wanted to keep.\n\nFeatures\n\nAccording to independent security lab AV-Comparatives, Eset Premium performed well in 2024 but failed to offer good security in previous years. Out of a possible three stars, Eset earned a single star in real-time malware protection tests conducted from July to October 2023.\n\nI usually refer to AV-Test when checking the track record of antivirus software. While the 2024 results show excellent malware prevention, there are big gaps in evaluations from December 2021 to February 2024.\n\nFor the best protection, an antivirus solution like Norton 360 boasts a near-perfect protection record that spans several years.\n\nI spot-checked browser protection by visiting Wicar\u2019s malware test website. Eset Premium successfully identified and blocked all 13 threats, in each case opening a new tab to alert me to the danger. For perspective, it\u2019s worth noting the free antivirus Microsoft Defender blocks Wicar threats also.\n\nI also tested the password manager, which asked me to create a master password, different from my Eset login, to unlock the vault. It\u2019s quite basic, automatically filling logins on websites where I have an account. The best password managers are much more advanced with login sharing, folders to organize accounts, and secure storage for files and photos.\n\nSupport\n\nEset Premium\u2019s help tab offers 24/7 technical support via an AI. In my tests, it was very responsive and could help with simple questions. However, the chatbot was easily stumped, reporting it doesn\u2019t have the requested information and supplying tangential links that didn\u2019t help.\n\nIf you expect quick responses from a real support agent, I found Bitdefender\u2019s customer service to be among the best. It\u2019s also a low-cost antivirus with a great track record.\n\nThe AI was able to provide the live chat hours, 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT. I tried again during normal hours, and the chatbot said no agents were available. However, it provided a link to a contact page that had a button for live chat.\n\nIf you use Eset, don\u2019t trust the AI to connect you to a human. Go to Eset\u2019s contact page. A live agent came on quickly and was able to answer my questions. Overall, support is good, despite the AI glitch.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nEset\u2019s privacy policy says your data is only used to provide the services you pay for. It\u2019s only shared with third-party companies that assist with customer support, billing, and other services related to your subscription.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s internal security seems robust, BleepingComputer reported Eset\u2019s exclusive partner Comsecure was breached. Hackers were able to target Eset customers in a brief (10 minutes) but malicious phishing campaign.\n\nIs Eset right for you?\n\nEset is fast and offers good protection in 2024, but it has a checkered track record. While leading antivirus software blocks threats year after year with few lapses, independent security labs found Eset allowed some malware in several tests between 2021 to 2023.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for protection without impacting performance, there are some better options that make the cut for the best antivirus software for gaming PCs."
