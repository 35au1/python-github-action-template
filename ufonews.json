            "article_content": "The author's father, circa 1981. Courtesy of Lyndall Riedel\n\nThere\u2019s one video available on the internet concerning my father, Patrick McGuire. It\u2019s strange. Uploaded to YouTube 15 years ago \u2014 though clearly recorded much earlier \u2014 the video frames another TV screen. There is constant static, and the image is fractured as if the broadcast comes from far away. My father is discussing cattle mutilations under hypnosis.\n\n\u201cWe come up on a cow that was dead. They cut the nose off, tongues out and the sex organs were gone,\u201d he recounts as though he is sleepwalking through a nightmare. He goes on to describe in great detail a \u201cspaceship\u201d that landed on his ranch and took members of his herd \u2015 their distant, terrified animal cries filling those dark prairie nights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne comment below the video reads, \u201cHaving lived and worked with cow-men, can you immagine this guy going to town after this got out publicly. I mean they are a finicky bunch to say the least.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t have to imagine. I grew up with him walking through our small Western town, his life by then fractured like that broadcast. He was completely destitute, picking through my classmates\u2019 garbage, and when a classmate came to school the next day and told me what they saw, their grin, and subsequent laughter, left little to the imagination. However, I then joined in with their laughter. That commenter was right: We are a finicky bunch, to say the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn May 14, 2009, my father passed away in a Colorado hospital due to cancer. He was 67. I did not speak to him before he died. His last years were spent in homelessness, though he hadn\u2019t always lived that way. His last words, so I heard, were about grand conspiracies and sinister deep states, though he hadn\u2019t always spoken about such topics. My father\u2019s legacy in our small Wyoming town \u2015 and inside our family \u2015 is stained with his tales of alien abduction, interstellar prophecy and the insistence he was chosen, though he had not always been chosen. There was a time before my birth when he was obsessed with the lore of his rural community, the spiraling complexities of high school dances and the schemes of enlarging his Roman Catholic family. He was normal, caring and complete. That was before the stars came knocking.\n\nWhen I first saw the bold headline \u201cIntelligence Officials Say U.S. Has Retrieved Craft of Non-Human Origin,\u201d published June 5, 2023, in The Debrief, I initially didn\u2019t think about whether the headline was true. I didn\u2019t contemplate what the recovered crafts might look like or that \u201cnon-human\u201d was just another euphemism for the same thing we have been talking about since 1947 \u2015 I thought about my father.\n\nI can see him now as though he were alive today, black cowboy hat tilted, face tanned and cracked from the high plains sun, saying, \u201cWho\u2019s laughing now?\u201d I\u2019m not laughing anymore, but not because I know what that headline is saying is absolutely true and proof lies just around the corner; I\u2019m not laughing because I should never have laughed in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ranch that once belonged to Patrick McGuire. The author's father claimed this was where he was visited by aliens. Courtesy of David Riedel\n\nIn 2017, The New York Times broke news about a previously unknown Pentagon department: the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). This department was involved in investigating what were formerly called UFOs, now referred to as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). More shifting euphemisms and acronyms for us to track. Since then, the news surrounding these phenomena has steadily grown. There was a congressional hearing in 2022, the creation of a governmental department called the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and a NASA hearing devoted to encountered \u2015 or not encountered \u2015 UAPs. And now a new whistleblower, former intelligence official and AATIP task force member David Grusch, claims a government cover-up. \u201cThese [programs] are retrieving non-human origin technical vehicles, call it spacecraft if you will, non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed,\u201d he stated to NewsNation recently. What once seemed to be the premise for the next \u201dX-Files\u201d reboot has become front page news, gaining mainstream consideration by the serious, the rational, the institutional and the scientific.\n\nIt\u2019s strange to be here in this cultural moment. I think many people feel that to some degree. Whether this is all true or not, it is unmooring to read that U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is demanding disclosure on a subject that, only a decade ago, would have been political suicide to even mention. To read former Pentagon official Lue Elizondo state, \u201cMy personal belief is that there is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone\u201d is surreal, and stranger still is reading about governmental UFO agencies and \u201cBlack Money\u201d in The New York Times.\n\nD.W. Pasulka, author of the 2019 book \u201dAmerican Cosmic,\u201d an exploration of our cultural interaction with the UFO phenomena, recently referred to this specific whistleblower event and to the preceding media coverage as a \u201cparadigm shift,\u201d a fundamental change in the way we conceptualize an issue. \u201cThat is,\u201d she explained, \u201cthere is huge pressure from [the] fringe, then marginal sources that finally initiate a shift in consensus.\u201d And there is an unexpected change in our current moment from the one that preceded it, though now it feels to me \u2014 perhaps, given my family history, more than most \u2014 like there has also been an unexpected change in the past.\n\nThe stigma against people who believe in UFOs may go back to the very birth of the topic itself, when the first reports of UFOs described by Kenneth Arnold went from \u201csaucer,\u201d \u201cdisk\u201d and \u201cpie pan\u201d to sensational terms like \u201cflying saucers\u201d in the press, for which Arnold later stated, \u201cI have, of course, suffered some embarrassment here and there by misquotes and misinformation.\u201d From there, this subject expanded to include tropes like anal probes, stock characters in films living their lonely, manic lives in houses criss-crossed with spiderwebs of yarn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbductees have been satirized on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and in popular beer commercials. Even famed Harvard psychologist Richard J. McNally stated in his past clinical research into the abduction phenomenon that \u201cit occasionally took [a researcher] several tries to record these [abduction] narratives properly. He would sometimes burst out laughing while trying to record these stories with the necessary solemnity.\u201d Insincerity and mockery has shrouded the subject so thoroughly that NASA recently shared at a hearing that \u201cthe stigma associated with reporting UFO sightings \u2014 as well as the harassment of people who work to investigate them \u2014 may be hindering efforts to determine their origins.\u201d\n\nI know that stigma well \u2015 having experienced it from both sides. My father was born and raised in Wyoming and was a rancher like his father and his grandfather. He nestled into a Western community that branded their cattle and youth alike with abstract symbols, that found definition in the regularity of rain and saw acreage as an inappropriate subject to discuss openly. \u201cAsking about the size of a man\u2019s spread is like asking to look at his checkbook,\u201d he said to me once, laughing. And one local recently told me, \u201cHe could break a horse like nobody\u2019s business. He was real sharp like that. Shame what happened to him.\u201d\n\nMy father saw UFOs. Not one, once, like a dinner guest might claim after a few glasses of wine, but many times. Numerous UFOs all at once, up close, lingering in the western Wyoming sky like a nightmare that refused to dissipate come sunrise. In 1981, on NBC\u2019s prime-time TV show \u201cThat\u2019s Incredible,\u201d my father\u2019s story gained national attention as he related, under hypnosis, the specifics of his abduction claims and the demands aliens had made upon his life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA yearbook photo of the author's father as featured in his funeral pamphlet. Courtesy of David Riedel\n\nOn the March 5, 1980, airing of ABC\u2019s \u201dEyewitness News,\u201d he reported that UFOs had landed on his ranch \u201csomewhere around 25, 30 times,\u201d and witnesses present were quoted as saying they saw \u201ctwo or three of them land at separate times\u2026 [and] we stayed and watched the sun come up and we saw two of them, in daylight, hovering in two separate places.\u201d A headline in the March 24, 1981, National Enquirer reads, \u201cFarmer: Aliens Use My Ranch as Their Landing Place,\u201d and it reports that \u201cLocal newspaper and television reporters have also seen strange lights darting over the McGuire ranch.\u201d\n\nThere appeared to be no shortage of witnesses to what was happening on his land. \u201cWhile we cannot be certain of what we saw,\u201d Casper Star Tribune investigative reporter Greg Bean wrote on June 29, 1980, \u201cnone of us left the McGuire farm with as much skepticism as we arrived with. Perhaps we can return.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father\u2019s claims continued. Under hypnosis with famous UFO psychologist R. Leo Sprinkle, he recounted abductions by \u201cStar People,\u201d who demanded his actions in conjunction with their plan for humanity. These Star People told him of a coming climate apocalypse. Following this hypnosis, in a mere handful of years, he was completely destitute without home or family, and he claimed that governmental forces were keeping him that way because of what he saw and said. This story is a regular in the UFO community. In fact, the story of Grusch, the whistleblower, is no surprise to the community, the folks who did believe and respect my father. Covert conspiracies, recovered craft, Nazi research and \u201cnon-human origins\u201d \u2015 almost everything the whistleblower related, my father related to me in similar fashion at some point in my life.\n\nFrom the earliest points in my childhood, I was told that UFOs were nothing to make light of. At every turn, every nightfall, through any locked door \u2014 the Star People could take anyone, even me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father\u2019s description of the Star People, and my subsequent nightmares, matched what our culture has come to expect: 5-foot hairless beings with eyes like colorless pools hovering by my bedside. Soon classmates and teachers alike were smirking at my fears, and then, like any sociological contagion, I began to smirk, too. Then TV took over for my teachers, and \u201cSouth Park, \u201cConeheads\u201d and \u201cMars Attacks\u201d taught me that this was, indeed, a laughing matter.\n\nMy brothers and I laughed when our father talked about the implants and their accompanying pain. We laughed when he claimed he could barely walk after what the Star People did to him. We laughed when he said that he was suing the government for the land they took from him, for destroying his life, for destroying our lives. We laughed. The world laughed.\n\nIf you were not one to laugh about UFOs, then you didn\u2019t say anything at all, and if you did, you hesitantly considered the person you were talking to first, making sure they would not laugh at you, too, before you said anything at all. For many, it was a precarious high-wire if one was to discuss the trauma of the phenomenon or its reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we weren\u2019t getting our meals in school, my father often took us to the local soup kitchen in a basement bunker in the town Episcopal cathedral. I remember best the dampness of the walls and the claustrophobia of dining elbow-to-elbow with the other folks weathering the financial storms outside. Breaking expired bread to share over lentil soup, we were often the only children in attendance. For most of the diners, this was the last place to go. The person across from me would make small talk between spoonfuls, but nothing of the weather or local gossip. In the soup kitchen, the talk was of remote viewing, reverse-engineering and tapping into the collective unconscious for cosmic spiritual growth. I would nod with feigned excitement and encourage them to continue, go deeper. \u201cWhat about the face of Mars?\u201d I would ask with a smile. My brothers and I often failed to contain our laughter.\n\nThe author's childhood home in Bosler, Wyoming. Courtesy of David Riedel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the world contemplates Grusch\u2019s claims, I\u2019m the one who feels ashamed. These potential findings mean only one thing to me: An accounting must be made. How should we address our past mockery and ridicule if it turns out that, hidden in a desert base somewhere, there are indeed crafts, cadavers and photographs of strange visitors?\n\nRegardless of the origins of the metallic orbs, Tic Tac crafts and flying saucers \u2014 and independent of the validity of Grusch\u2019s claims \u2014 we should feel impelled to investigate and rescue a community living with the trauma of the unknown and indescribable. A community we greeted with sneers and derision for so long, a community we pushed to the outskirts of our cultural limits to be safely ignored. If it is all true \u2015 or it is all lies and sickness \u2015 we should approach both valuations with care and consideration, even skepticism, but not with the intense ridicule so many of us have given them for so long.\n\nI cannot say for certain that a shift in the wider cultural acceptance of UFOs is already occurring in our institutions, as some have begun to state, but I can report what has occurred in my own consciousness. Since the \u201950s, intrepid investigators have spent their whole lives and careers dedicated to the phenomenon of UFOs and abductions, and here we are, possibly closer to the truth than ever. And yet I somehow feel no closer to understanding my father. I was not at his side while he lay on his deathbed, by choice \u2015 a choice I seemingly made as a child and never reassessed. I chose not to hear his last words, and that\u2019s hard for me to accept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough delusions are commonly encountered in schizophrenia and affective disorder, it turns out that anyone can have them,\u201d Mahzarin Banaji and John Kihlstrom stated in their 1996 research titled, \u201cThe Ordinary Nature of Alien Abduction Memories.\u201d \u201cThey are natural byproducts of our attempts to explain the unusual things that can happen to us.\u201d As has been the tradition with this topic, I have little certainty about what happened to my father; I can only say that something unusual happened to him, then he spent the rest of his life trying to make sense of it. And now I will spend the rest of my life trying to make sense of him.\n\nDavid Riedel, born and educated in Bosler, Wyoming, is a University of Wyoming graduate student whose writing often examines the realities of addiction and mental illness inside this strange, frightening world we all inhabit.

Credit: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAdult content, including AI-generated nudes, remains banned on Facebook and Instagram, despite recent policy changes at Meta.\n\nHowever, that hasn't stopped \"nudify\" apps \u2014 platforms that create nonconsensual AI-generated nudes of celebrities and influencers \u2014 from advertising on Meta's platforms. And those ads have been extremely successful for at least one service called Crush AI.\n\nAccording to a new report from 404Media , as originally reported in Alexios Mantzarlis' Faked Up newsletter, the Crush AI modifier app receives the vast majority of its traffic from Meta platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. According to Similarweb's data, last month Crush AI received more than a quarter of a million visits to its service \u2014 and roughly 90 percent of that traffic was from Meta's platforms.\n\nCrush AI makes it quite clear what the purpose of its service is in its advertisements. The company's ads include photos of real-life individuals like Instagram influencer and model Mikayla Demaiter and OnlyFans creator Sophie Rain. The ads boast that users can \"upload a photo\" and \"erase anyone's clothes.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Crush AI creates fake profile pages using AI-generated profile pictures and runs new ads using those pages. The ads promote different domain names that then redirect to Crush AI when clicked.\n\nMashable has previously reported on other deepfakes and AI platforms that utilize Meta's advertising platform to generate traffic and revenue from AI-generated adult content. These ads are strictly against Meta's policies, and the company often removes them once it becomes aware of specific advertisements.\n\nHowever, as 404Media previously reported , Meta appears to have different standards for ad moderation. Policy-breaking content published by users as Facebook or Instagram posts will often be automatically detected by Meta and subsequently removed. Yet, that same content will not be detected when uploaded to Meta's advertising platform."

            "article_content": "\u2018The Lady of the Lake\u2019 Review: A Disjointed Hodgepodge of True Crime and the Paranormal\n\nI am intrigued by true crime programming and also have an appreciation for matters of the supernatural. Seeing as Ryan Grulich\u2019s documentary The Lady of the Lake exists at the intersection of true crime and the paranormal, I had high hopes going in. The first 30 minutes of the documentary are reasonably engaging and show a level of promise. But the film quickly loses its way after that. What starts as an examination of a grisly murder and the strange aftermath ultimately devolves into a needless jumble of paranormal investigation and half-baked theories about the afterlife.\n\nThe Lady of the Lake Plays out like this:\n\nThe documentary follows the life and death of Port Angeles, Washington resident Hallie Illingworth. Hallie was unlucky in love and eventually died at the hands of her third husband. Four years after her disappearance, she surfaced in Crescent Lake. Her reappearance is remarkable because the body of water is so deep that the actual depth is currently unknown. Human remains discarded in the lake almost never reach the surface. What\u2019s more, when she was found, one of her hands was pointed upward. Rigor mortis would have long since come and gone after four years\u2019 time. So, her articulated limb remains something of a mystery. That, along with other details of her demise has seen Hallie become a local legend along the lines of Bloody Mary.\n\nI have a special interest in the case based on the fact that I grew up just a few hours from Port Angeles and have school friends who live and work there now. However, The Lady of the Lake did little to satiate my curiosity or do Hallie\u2019s story justice. There are several reasons the picture doesn\u2019t work. The first element that jumped out at me was the cringe recreations. Grulich features seemingly endless footage of a woman dressed as Hallie haunting the lake and dancing around in a nightie. It\u2019s really distracting and takes credibility away from the proceedings.\n\nA lack of focus quickly derails the film.\n\nAdding insult to injury, The Lady of the Lake lacks focus. The picture goes in too many different directions, getting further and further from the core focus as the runtime rolls on. At roughly the 30-minute mark, the picture devolves into a superfluous discussion of liminal spaces and how Hallie was likely a liminal being. Then, the filmmakers pivot to detailing the lake\u2019s history of mysterious deaths and a serial killer who allegedly once dumped a body there. From there, we examine Washington state as a hotbed for cryptids and paranormal activity and discuss unproven methods for communicating with the other side. The aforementioned diversions only tangentially relate to Hallie\u2019s case, making the final 60 minutes of the documentary painful to endure and largely unnecessary.\n\nAnother aspect that hobbles the film\u2019s success is the framing. The crew shoots the subjects profiled primarily in wide shots. That does nothing to obscure their fidgeting hands. It\u2019s nerve-wracking to appear on camera. I completely understand. But watching the talking heads squirm and twitch is distracting for the viewer. If it were purposeful and intended to give us a view into the state of mind of those profiled, that would be a different story. But this isn\u2019t their story. It\u2019s Hallie\u2019s.\n\nI wish that Grulich had stuck to Hallie\u2019s story and spent more time going in-depth with her life, death, and legacy. Instead, that\u2019s all frontloaded into the first 30 minutes and effectively abandoned thereafter. What follows reads very much like filler designed to stretch out the runtime to feature length.\n\nOn the whole:\n\nThe Lady of the Lake is best in its first 30 minutes when it\u2019s discussing the titular victim. If the filmmakers had stayed on that trajectory, they may have had a more palatable product. If you are keen to seek it out, you can find the film on VOD from Uncork\u2019d Entertainment as of the publication of this post."

            "article_content": "To ring in 2025, several folks gathered at the Chadron Public Library for a chance to get an eye on some spooks at the building. While there were no books flying off the shelves or any spiteful spirits looking to harm anyone, there certainly was a lot of activity happening on devices provided by Richard Dabney and apps that participants downloaded.\n\nFollowing the event, Dabney stated, \u201cWe got some interesting results from the ghost hunt.\u201d He found several \"electronic voice phenomena\" and a possible paranormal photo. He shared them with a friend in Omaha who has paranormal experience and thinks they might be the real deal and not recordings of people who were in the group.\n\nDabney also utilized a Ovilus spirit box, through which several words could be heard, as well as flashlights that would flicker, or turn off or on when questions were asked without anyone touching them.\n\n\u201cI have been ghost hunting since around 2005 after accidentally getting some inexplicable orbs and mists in photos taken with my first digital camera, the orbs showing up in large quantities at Athens State University in Alabama during a bluegrass music festival, and some background research revealing that two of the oldest buildings there were widely believed to be haunted by the locals and students,\u201d Dabney said.\n\n\u201cIn Chadron I captured my first EVP recordings at the Olde Main Street Inn using a small Sony mp3 recorder, that place is so haunted EVP'S can be captured in the parking lot and across the street as well! The Bean Broker is also a great place for ghosts, with objects occasionally getting bumped off shelves or moved around inexplicably, and EVP'S often happening unexpectedly when recording radio announcements, abruptly inserted between the announcer's words.\u201d\n\nDabney has also expressed interest in having another \u201cghost hunt\u201d in the former Chadron Record building.\n\nRegardless if the phenomena on Dec. 31 was actually ghosts helping ring in the New Year, Library Director Rosella Tesch said there have been some unexplained events. There was a lot of active phenomena back in the \u201870s, she said, and the janitor at the time had seen an apparition of a woman in white. Another staff member confirmed the sighting, she added.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I have seen books moving,\u201d Tesch said, noting that things seem to happen during the day more than the night. \u201cI saw one shelf, all the books moved.\u201d Staff have also found books on the floor during mornings, and during the Covid pandemic when absolutely no patrons allowed in the building staff would get frustrated because they would organize books to come back and find them out of order.\n\nAside from the books, custodial staff have seen lights turn off by themselves at night when nobody else is around.\n\n\u201cIt might be months with nothing happening, and then something goofy happens,\u201d Tesch said. While nobody has gotten hurt, she said, \u201cyou never know.\u201d\n\nThe library formerly utilized the annex building for a regular ghost hunt, though Tesch said, \u201cthat place was really weird and bizarre.\u201d She recalled one of the hunts, during Halloween, resulted in some very strange photos, and she once saw a floating orb.\n\n\u201cThat place was disconcerting,\u201d she said of the annex. \u201cI could never be there on my own.\u201d"

Or rather, was.\n\nThe name itself translates as 'stone heap of the wildcat', with a modern name for the site being Gilgal Refa\u02beim which translates as 'Wheel of Ghosts' or Wheel of Spirits'.\n\nMade up of almost 40,000 tonnes of stone, it is estimated to have taken more than 25,000 combined working days to have put the megalith together.\n\nSpooky theories surrounding Rujm el-Hiri\n\nHaving been first discovered in 1967 during an archaeological survey, it was only then excavated in 2007.\n\nAdvert\n\nExperts have ruled out it being a burial site given that no human remains are on the site.\n\nBut some still theorise that astronomical connections are behind it, connected to ancient cultures observing the stars and planets while others think it could be linked to rituals and offerings to gods.\n\nRujm el-Hiri is in Syria, north of Israel (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\nRujm el-Hiri new findings\n\nIn a new study on the monument, published in the journal Remote Sensing, new satellite images of Rujm el-Hiri have been analysed by scientists from Tel Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe findings put doubt on links to astronomy and the stars.\n\nInstead, it has been confirmed that the structure has physically moved over time.\n\nDue to Earth's tectonic plates moving over time - we're talking eight to 15 millimetres every year for the last 150 million years - there has been significant alteration to the walls and entrances of the structure.\n\nAs a result, the site has moved counterclockwise and moved the entire monument by tens of metres.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt's moved over time (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\n\"The findings show that the entrances and radial walls during that historical period were entirely different, reopening the question of the site\u2019s purpose,\" the research team says.\n\n\"This implies that the primary axes of Rujm el-Hiri have rotated over time along with the entire region, casting significant doubt on the popular theory that Rujm el-Hiri was an observatory.\"\n\nThe outer walls of Rujm el-Hiri were built between 5,000BC and 4,500BC."

Ms. Packard has helped repurpose the thick-glassed fish museums of old into potent forces for ocean conservation action.\n\nBuilt with a $55 million donation by her parents, David and Lucile Packard of the tech giant Hewlett-Packard, the aquarium has received tens of millions of visitors. Sightseers at the aquarium, a Northern California institution, have taken in a number of world firsts: the successful exhibition and release of great white sharks; the reintroduction of orphaned Southern sea otter pups to the wild; and the large-scale display of creatures such as salmon snailfish and vampire squid, found far below the reach of sunlight in a region known as the midnight zone.\n\nAt a time when rising ocean temperatures are altering water chemistry, changing fish migration patterns and making marine life more susceptible to the effects of overfishing, Ms. Packard\u2019s staff has demonstrated how to restore ocean health by reducing plastic pollution and raising awareness of environmentally sustainable seafood. The aquarium\u2019s partner organization, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, has developed and deployed robotic submersibles that are transforming how scientists explore the ocean.\n\nA tall, gracious, casually elegant woman who wears her scholarship lightly, Ms. Packard has run the aquarium in a low-key, pragmatic way. \u201cLike my father,\u201d she said. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nWhy are you retiring now?\n\nWell, I\u2019m not exactly retiring. I\u2019m transitioning to a leadership role on the board of trustees. I decided that it\u2019s a great time to hand over the reins to our next generation of leaders. We have a great team and are in a really good financial position.\n\nWhat do you think you\u2019ll miss most?\n\nThe day-to-day interactions with the scientists. Fortunately, as a board member, I\u2019ll still run into people in the hallways who have just figured out how to breed some obscure animal that no one\u2019s ever seen before. I love collaborating with passionate people who are really fired up about what they\u2019re doing as much as I love seeing a child\u2019s eyes light up at the sight of a giant sea bass or a bloodybelly comb jelly. Both give me great joy."

Learn More \u203a\n\nA man unlocking his front door with a smart keypad.\n\nWe love any opportunity to see the debuts of fun, new, even futuristic gadgets\u2014who doesn\u2019t? But the home security technology unveiled at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) had our attention because of what it means for homeowners\u2019 safety, convenience, and savings.\n\nBased on what CES presented, we saw several home security trends emerge for protecting property, family, and packages. With corresponding technology offering everything from better sensors to sleeker designs, these are our predictions for home safety and security in 2025.\n\nPhoto: Lockly\n\n1. Sleeker, Design-Forward Security\n\nThough door knobs with smart locks have added numerical or touchscreen keypads, they still look relatively similar to traditional handles. As technology advances, however, we see companies focusing on more sleek, modern designs that not only incorporate additional features but also reimagine the standard design of smart handles.\n\nLockly Styla\n\nLoved by DIYers and professional builders alike, Lockly is leading the way in creating new looks and enhanced functionality with the Styla. This combination front door handle, smart deadbolt, and video doorbell fits into a cylindrical modern door pull most easily imaginable for high-end residential applications. And it fits a lot in a skinny profile. The video component has a motion sensor, a 2K camera with color night vision, and two-way audio. The smart lock works via a 3D fingerprint sensor, a PIN Genie pad with a randomizable keypad, an RFID reader with programmable fobs, and a traditional keyhole.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough its aesthetics push the envelope enough that they may take some getting used to, we think this and other innovative designs will continue to become more common. This all-in-one handle, lock, and video doorbell comes in matte black, gray, and gold and is battery-powered for easy installation and rechargeable via USB. The Styla also comes with Lockly\u2019s new Wi-Fi hub that privately stores recorded videos and audibly chimes rather than pinging your phone. Stay tuned for when the Lockly Styla becomes available later this year.\n\nPhoto: Schlage\n\n2. Better Sensors\n\nWhile most of us have seen smart locks with numeric buttons or touchscreen keypads, some recently released products indicate better and much harder-to-fool technology is on the way. Though we\u2019re only highlighting two popular CES products here, we predict many brands will be increasing their focus on lock sensors for home security soon.\n\nTCL Smart Lock D1 Pro\n\nThe TCL Smart Lock D1 Pro requires something much more unique than a four-digit code to unlock it: your palm. Though the D1 Pro was launched this past October, CES attendees couldn\u2019t help but flock to see its revolutionary operation. Among its seven unlocking methods, the most interesting by far is its use of AI technology to read and recognize the layout of veins in your palm. Like many other smart locks, it also works via keypad, app, cards, period passwords, standard keys, and voice assist via Google Home and Amazon Alexa. The lock features a 7,800mAh rechargeable battery and durable IP54 weather-resistant construction.\n\nGet the TCL D1 smart lock at Amazon for $179.99.\n\nSchlage Sense Pro\n\nAnother reputable leader in the home security market, Schlage introduced its new Sense Pro Smart Deadbolt at this year\u2019s CES. In addition to a standard touchscreen keypad for code entry, the smart deadbolt uses Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology paired with select personal devices of your choosing to enable hands-free and tap-to-unlock access. Connected to your smart home network, the lock can automatically calculate your speed and trajectory as you approach and unlatch on its own. The Sense Pro is expected to come out later this year.\n\nPhoto: Switchbot\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Increased Front Door Visibility\n\nWith video doorbells showing up next to more front doors every day, it\u2019s relatively standard to be able to check your phone when you hear a chime alerting you to a visitor. Still, it\u2019s not always the most convenient if you\u2019re on a call to see if there\u2019s cause for attention or alarm. Some households may include members without smartphones who can\u2019t access an app-only display. Two products that showed up at CES remedied this issue by integrating their own displays, hardwiring optional.\n\nSwitchBot Video Doorbell\n\nThe SwitchBot Video Doorbell combines a traditional-looking video doorbell with a 4.3-inch smart display screen you can sit on a surface or mount to the wall. The screen delivers live videos, notifies you if anyone arrives, lets you talk to visitors while keeping your door closed, and features 512GB of local storage.\n\nThe unit can be either wired or battery-powered, and SwitchBot will also offer a solar panel to ensure continuous operation. The 2K resolution camera has a 165-degree field of view and color night vision to help you identify visitors no matter the time of day. At the time of publication, no specifics on the SwitchBot Video Doorbell launch date have been announced yet.\n\nLockly Vision Prestige\n\nIn a similar push to enable front door visibility without relying on phones, Lockly will release its Vision Prestige smart lock later this year. Rather than casting video to a separate screen like the SwitchBot Video Doorbell, this lock has a display on its interior housing. It uses presence detection powered by bit radar and a 2K resolution camera with facial recognition to clock when a person is at the door, and the screen lights up when you touch it so you can identify that individual from the inside. It even boasts an intercom, like most video doorbell cameras, so that you can have a conversation through your front door.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Vision Prestige offers a few different means of securing the home, too: keyed entry, fingerprint recognition, and a patented pin entry. You can switch from a traditional touchscreen keypad to Lockly\u2019s PIN Genie, which places digits in random locations, guaranteeing safe entry into your home without revealing your code to prying eyes. We expect the Prestige\u2014an upgrade to the current Lockly Vision\u2014to drop near the end of the year.\n\nPhoto: Hyve\n\n4. Smarter Ways To Secure Deliveries\n\nWhile package delivery boxes and locking mailboxes aren\u2019t a totally new concept, more options have hit the market with smart features like remote locking and unlocking via app and automated video recording. And since package theft is a problem almost everyone has experienced, seen, or heard about, we predict package lockboxes with additional security features will continue to roll out.\n\nHyve Smart Home Delivery Pod\n\nThe Hyve smart home delivery pod may look somewhat similar to a standard front porch delivery box. Like other smart delivery boxes, users can lock and unlock the Hyve pod via an app and send unique codes to drivers, family members, and friends. But that\u2019s far from all this model offers. The box sounds a siren and sends a tamper alert to your phone if it detects anyone is attempting to access it without authorization. It also features a carbon-fiber tether to secure the entire unit to a column or railing, preventing would-be thieves from stealing the entire box. There\u2019s a window on top to allow drivers to take delivery confirmation photos, and Hyve is even compatible with package pickup software to help make arranging returns easier. You can join the waitlist for the smart package pod, expected to start shipping in June.\n\nThe Overlap Between Home Security and Internet Safety\n\nAs smart home security devices continue to evolve, their effectiveness increasingly relies on robust internet connectivity and cybersecurity. An IT expert from ORTIT, an IT consulting service in Frankfurt, highlights, \u201cEven the most sophisticated smart locks or video doorbells can be rendered vulnerable without a secure and well-managed network.\u201d Research supports this, showing that improperly secured systems are a leading cause of breaches in smart home setups.\n\nTo ensure both convenience and safety, integrating devices like video doorbells or smart locks with professional-grade network solutions is essential. This approach not only enhances device functionality but also safeguards against potential cyberattacks, protecting your family and home. ORTIT emphasizes that by addressing these gaps early, homeowners can avoid costly vulnerabilities while enjoying the full benefits of modern home security technology."

            "article_content": "Scientists studying a 5,000-year-old monument in the Middle East have made a startling discovery about the structure.\n\nCalled Rujm el-Hiri, it is often referred to as the 'Stonehenge of the East' due to its similarities to the English monument.\n\nOfficially called 'megalith' structures, it is scientific speak for prehistoric constructions put together using large stone with many of them found across Europe in particular; some 35,000 exist on the continent alone.\n\nAdvert\n\nRujm el-Hiri is not found in Europe, though, with it located in the Golan Heights region of Syria.\n\nRujm el-Hiri from the sky (MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhat is Rujm el-Hiri?\n\nRoughly 16 kilometres inland from the Sea of Galilee, it is made up of more than 42,000 rocks arranged in concentric circles.\n\nAdvert\n\nAt the middle of it all is a large mound of rocks that is 15 foot high at its tallest point, which is roughly 4.6 metres.\n\nBut to this day people aren't quite sure what the point of Rujm el-Hiri is. Or rather, was.\n\nThe name itself translates as 'stone heap of the wildcat', with a modern name for the site being Gilgal Refa\u02beim which translates as 'Wheel of Ghosts' or Wheel of Spirits'.\n\nMade up of almost 40,000 tonnes of stone, it is estimated to have taken more than 25,000 combined working days to have put the megalith together.\n\nSpooky theories surrounding Rujm el-Hiri\n\nHaving been first discovered in 1967 during an archaeological survey, it was only then excavated in 2007.\n\nAdvert\n\nExperts have ruled out it being a burial site given that no human remains are on the site.\n\nBut some still theorise that astronomical connections are behind it, connected to ancient cultures observing the stars and planets while others think it could be linked to rituals and offerings to gods.\n\nRujm el-Hiri is in Syria, north of Israel (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\nRujm el-Hiri new findings\n\nIn a new study on the monument, published in the journal Remote Sensing, new satellite images of Rujm el-Hiri have been analysed by scientists from Tel Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe findings put doubt on links to astronomy and the stars.\n\nInstead, it has been confirmed that the structure has physically moved over time.\n\nDue to Earth's tectonic plates moving over time - we're talking eight to 15 millimetres every year for the last 150 million years - there has been significant alteration to the walls and entrances of the structure.\n\nAs a result, the site has moved counterclockwise and moved the entire monument by tens of metres.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt's moved over time (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\n\"The findings show that the entrances and radial walls during that historical period were entirely different, reopening the question of the site\u2019s purpose,\" the research team says.\n\n\"This implies that the primary axes of Rujm el-Hiri have rotated over time along with the entire region, casting significant doubt on the popular theory that Rujm el-Hiri was an observatory.\"\n\nThe outer walls of Rujm el-Hiri were built between 5,000BC and 4,500BC."

            "article_content": "Julie Packard, the marine biologist who has presided over the Monterey Bay Aquarium since it opened in 1984 and shepherded it through the Covid pandemic, announced her retirement as executive director on Wednesday. Ms. Packard has helped repurpose the thick-glassed fish museums of old into potent forces for ocean conservation action.\n\nBuilt with a $55 million donation by her parents, David and Lucile Packard of the tech giant Hewlett-Packard, the aquarium has received tens of millions of visitors. Sightseers at the aquarium, a Northern California institution, have taken in a number of world firsts: the successful exhibition and release of great white sharks; the reintroduction of orphaned Southern sea otter pups to the wild; and the large-scale display of creatures such as salmon snailfish and vampire squid, found far below the reach of sunlight in a region known as the midnight zone.\n\nAt a time when rising ocean temperatures are altering water chemistry, changing fish migration patterns and making marine life more susceptible to the effects of overfishing, Ms. Packard\u2019s staff has demonstrated how to restore ocean health by reducing plastic pollution and raising awareness of environmentally sustainable seafood. The aquarium\u2019s partner organization, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, has developed and deployed robotic submersibles that are transforming how scientists explore the ocean.\n\nA tall, gracious, casually elegant woman who wears her scholarship lightly, Ms. Packard has run the aquarium in a low-key, pragmatic way. \u201cLike my father,\u201d she said. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nWhy are you retiring now?\n\nWell, I\u2019m not exactly retiring. I\u2019m transitioning to a leadership role on the board of trustees. I decided that it\u2019s a great time to hand over the reins to our next generation of leaders. We have a great team and are in a really good financial position.\n\nWhat do you think you\u2019ll miss most?\n\nThe day-to-day interactions with the scientists. Fortunately, as a board member, I\u2019ll still run into people in the hallways who have just figured out how to breed some obscure animal that no one\u2019s ever seen before. I love collaborating with passionate people who are really fired up about what they\u2019re doing as much as I love seeing a child\u2019s eyes light up at the sight of a giant sea bass or a bloodybelly comb jelly. Both give me great joy."

            "article_content": "An illustration of five galaxies aligned like a string of pearls.\n\nAstronomers have discovered a rare group of five dwarf galaxies located relatively close to Earth; these galaxies exist in a near-perfect alignment, resembling a string of cosmic pearls in the sky.\n\nHeld together by their mutual gravity, several of the dwarf galaxies (designated D1 to D5) are rhythmically dancing with one another while others are engaged in a \"cosmic tug of war,\" ripping gas and stars away from each other.\n\nThe scientists behind this discovery say these factors make this dwarf galaxy grouping particularly intriguing. The arrangement may be as challenging as it is beautiful, potentially posing a problem for our best model of cosmic evolution.\n\nThe observed dwarf galaxies sit relatively close to Earth at just around 117 million light-years away.\n\n\"These galaxies are small, faint and rich in gas, yet all of them are actively forming new stars \u2014 a surprising trait for dwarf galaxies in a group,\" team leader Cristiano G. Sabiu of the University of Seoul told Space.com. \"Even more striking is their nearly perfect alignment in the sky, forming a distinct 'string of cosmic pearls.'\"\n\nThe galaxies were discovered via data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which mapped one-quarter of the entire sky over Earth in great detail, determining the positions and absolute brightnesses of hundreds of millions of celestial objects. Data from several other astronomical surveys also aided the discovery team.\n\nRelated: James Webb telescope spies stunning 'Firefly Sparkle' galaxy \u2014 a baby clone of the Milky Way being 'assembled brick by brick' in the early universe\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nDwarf galaxies dancing and holding hands\n\nAs the name implies, dwarf galaxies are low-mass realms with low stellar populations, which means they are also rather dim in terms of brightness. The total mass of these five dwarf galaxies appears to be around 60.2 billion solar masses (one solar mass being equivalent to the mass of the sun). For comparison, our galaxy, the Milky Way, is estimated to have a mass that is equivalent to around 1.5 trillion suns.\n\n\n\nThe most massive of these five dwarf galaxies (D2) has a mass equivalent to just 275 million suns. The least massive, D4, has a mass of just 14.7 million solar masses. That means, while D1 to D5 fit in well in terms of other dwarf galaxy characteristics, they are major outliers in terms of their companionship.\n\nDwarf galaxies tend to be fairly lonesome, with less than 5% found with close galactic companions. The chance of finding five dwarf galaxies grouped together as they are in this case is less than 0.004%.\n\n\"This unusual arrangement raises the question,\" Sabiu said. \"Is this alignment a mere coincidence, or does it hint at a deeper connection related to their formation and evolution?\"\n\nAn image of a rare grouping of five dwarf galaxies named D1 to D5. (Image credit: Podesta, et al)\n\nSabiu continued by explaining that the fact that three of these dwarf galaxies (D1, D2 and D5) share the same rotational direction adds to the uniqueness of this arrangement.\n\n\n\n\"It is as if performing a synchronized cosmic dance,\" Sabiu added. \"This could provide valuable clues about their shared origins or the role of their environment in shaping their motions.\"\n\nTwo dwarf galaxies are actively interacting in a galactic \"tug of war\" contest contributing to the mystery of this galactic grouping. This gravitational interaction pulls matter from the galaxies, forming visible \"tidal tails\u201d of gas and stars.\n\n\"Such interactions often trigger bursts of star formation and can significantly alter a galaxy\u2019s shape over time,\" Sabiu explained.\n\nSabiu explained why the discovery of these dwarf galaxies challenges our best theory of cosmic evolution, the standard model of cosmology, or the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model.\n\n\"This discovery poses a challenge to the LCDM model, as it may struggle to account for the formation of such small, aligned groups of galaxies in isolated environments,\" the researcher said.\n\nThe team's research was published in November in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nOriginally posted on Space.com."

The platform enters closed beta testing with an initial group of 500+ traders, targeting a significant reduction in emotional trading errors \u2013 a key factor in the well-documented 90-95% failure rate among retail traders.\n\nThe platform streamlines complex trading processes through systematic execution and automated risk management, addressing key issues that typically lead to trading losses.\n\n\u201cCurrent trading platforms are part of the problem, not the solution,\u201d says Good Market\u2019s development team. \u201cWhile Binance, Coinbase, and other exchanges focus on transaction volume, they\u2019ve neglected the fundamental issue: traders lack systematic execution tools that prevent emotional trading and enforce disciplined strategies.\u201d\n\nDemo: Good Markets platform\n\nGood Market\u2019s Smart Assist Intelligence\u2122 tackles this crisis head-on by automating trade execution and risk management. The platform allows traders to configure up to 300+ parameters, including technical indicators and entry/exit conditions, without writing code. This systematic approach eliminates the psychological biases that plague manual trading of popular tokens like Polygon (MATIC), Chainlink (LINK), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nCore Platform Features:\n\nAI-assisted analysis with semi-auto or fully automated execution\n\nAI-prompted strategy builder with 300+ parameters (no coding required)\n\nAutomated position sizing and risk controls\n\nA community marketplace for verified strategies\n\nIntegrated technical and fundamental analysis\n\nGetting $GOOD\n\nThe platform\u2019s native token, $GOOD, offers practical benefits including trading fee reductions of up to 20% and access to premium features. The initial token sale begins at $0.025, with 4 million tokens available in Phase 1 before moving to $0.05 in Phase 2.\n\nEarly Investor Benefits:\n\nBeta platform access\n\nInvitation to London investor meetup\n\nFounder-tier platform status\n\nPremium features for holders of 10,000+ tokens\n\nInput on platform development\n\nAbout Good Market\n\nThe Good Market team combines deep expertise in cryptocurrency trading and traditional finance, including key architects from M2 Exchange who managed over $2B in trading volume and product leaders from Freetrade. Development began in February 2024, building on years of direct experience with retail trading challenges.\n\nThe platform will move to public beta in Q1 2025. Early investors can participate at www.goodmarket.ai.\n\nNote: Trading cryptocurrency and other assets carry a significant risk of loss. Good Market provides tools for systematic trading but does not guarantee trading profits. Popular cryptocurrencies mentioned like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others experience high volatility and should be traded with caution.\n\nConnecting with Good Market:\n\nMedia Contact: [email protected]\n\nwww.goodmarket.ai\n\nContact\n\nMr\n\nChike Chiejine\n\nGood Market\n\n[email protected]"

Despite the underweight rating, the bank forecasts Tesla shares will collapse another 70% to $125 in the next year.\n\nWells Fargo's analyst commented that the grim prediction is driven by weak business fundamentals. They point to Tesla's struggles to prop up vehicle deliveries despite deep discounts, and they warn about fierce competition from Chinese EV players.\n\nThe analyst added that the potential to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits may impact a serious threat to Tesla's pricing power and U.S. market demand.\n\nAlso, Tesla's futuristic CyberCab and humanoid robot Optimus fail to impress Wells Fargo. These innovations have always been exciting, but the bank warns they are in development and are still incredibly expensive, even though they are operational in some form.\n\nThis gloomy projection is made when Tesla enthusiasts are still betting big on the company's long-term vision. Will Elon Musk's team twist the skeptics to prove wrong, or does Tesla head towards a big correction as predicted?\n\nThree Reasons Why Wells Fargo Predicts 70% Plunge on Tesla's Stock\n\nGF Score for Tesla is 78 per 100, highlights company's high financial strength and high revenue growth, but investors should take note that the profitability of Tesla is moderate, and the stock price is considered expensive.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n"

And, now, Google Search appears to have hit its lowest market share in a decade.\n\nAs first spotted by SearchEngineLand, Google has dropped below 90% share in the worldwide search engine market over the past three months, marking a clear trend. The last time that Google\u2019s share was under 90% for three months was in early 2015. The data is provided by StatCounter, which uses tracking data on millions of websites to find trends among search engines, device usage, and more. That data isn\u2019t infallible to mistakes, as we likely saw with recent Google Pixel data, but there\u2019s obviously a trend in this case.\n\nWhy the drop in Google Search usage?\n\nThere are likely a lot of factors at play, but one highly likely reason is increased competition. The generative AI boom has led to new search offerings such as Perplexity and even OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Privacy-conscious users may have also adopted alternate search engines. StatCounter doesn\u2019t provide much insight there, beyond showing that Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex all very slightly grew (still fluctuating) while Google shrank.\n\nAnother point to consider is that, especially among younger audiences, TikTok is becoming a go-to location for searching for information, to the point where TikTok even tested linking out to Google Search in its own app. Google also started sourcing TikTok in early 2024.\n\nMore on Google Search:\n\nFollow Ben: Twitter/X, Threads, Bluesky, and Instagram"

            "article_content": "This study explores how the integration of DevOps methodologies has transformed the management of cloud infrastructure, with a focus on the critical role of automation in achieving scalability. Originating as a response to the inefficiencies and challenges faced in traditional software development and IT operations, DevOps emphasizes a culture of collaboration and automation to enhance the speed and quality of software delivery. This transformation has been pivotal in addressing the \u201cfatal level of dysfunction\u201d perceived between development and operations, ultimately streamlining workflows and enabling faster, more reliable deployments.[1][2]\n\nAt its core, DevOps integrates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) by implementing practices such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), and automated monitoring. These practices facilitate a seamless and repeatable process for software development and deployment, reducing human error and ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages.[3][4][5] Automation tools, including AWS, Azure, GitLab, and Jenkins, play an essential role in managing infrastructure resources, enabling businesses to scale operations efficiently and respond quickly to market demands.[6][3]\n\nThe adoption of DevOps within cloud environments has introduced significant enhancements in scalability, largely through practices like containerization and microservices architecture. These technologies allow for greater application portability and resource optimization, thus supporting the efficient scaling of individual services and contributing to overall system reliability.[3][7] As DevOps continues to evolve, organizations are increasingly leveraging its principles to maintain a competitive advantage in dynamic markets, overcoming traditional infrastructure limitations and fostering innovation.[1][8]\n\nDespite its benefits, the implementation of DevOps is not without challenges, including the need for careful oversight and cultural shifts within organizations. The transition to a DevOps model requires buy-in across all levels to ensure successful collaboration and accountability, thereby maximizing the impact of automation and scalability practices in cloud infrastructure management.[4][9] As the industry continues to advance, DevOps is expected to play an even more integral role in shaping the future of cloud infrastructure, driving further adoption of cutting-edge practices and technologies.[1][6]\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThe evolution of DevOps in cloud infrastructure can be traced back to a growing recognition of dysfunction in the software development and IT operations industries in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During this period, proposals began to emerge advocating for the integration of software development methodologies with deployment and operations concepts[1]. However, it was not until around 2007 and 2008 that the DevOps movement started to gain significant traction. This surge was driven by mounting concerns within the IT and software development communities regarding the detrimental separation between development and operations, which was perceived to create a \u201cfatal level of dysfunction\u201d in the industry[2][1].\n\nDevOps was conceived as a methodological response to these challenges, emphasizing collaboration, culture change, and the adoption of specific practices and tools[1]. The movement sought to address the inefficiencies and slow delivery times of traditional software development and IT operations practices by integrating and automating their processes[1]. This integration aimed to improve the speed and quality of software delivery, thereby enhancing the overall systems development life cycle[1].\n\nAutomation has played a crucial role in the evolution of DevOps, particularly as businesses moved toward cloud infrastructure. The automation of cloud infrastructure allows for better scalability, monitoring, and efficiency, addressing some of the initial concerns that spurred the DevOps movement[6]. By adopting these automated practices, organizations can streamline their processes, focusing more on application development rather than the complexities of underlying infrastructure management[10].\n\nKey Concepts in DevOps\n\nDevOps is fundamentally a methodology in the software development and IT industry that focuses on the integration and automation of the work performed by software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). This approach is aimed at improving and shortening the systems development life cycle, ensuring that new features and improvements can be delivered to users more efficiently and with higher quality[1].\n\nOne of the core principles of DevOps is shared ownership, where development and operations teams work closely together to foster collaboration, streamline workflows, and enhance communication across all stages of the software delivery process. This cultural shift towards collaboration enables teams to address issues more rapidly and make informed decisions, resulting in a more responsive and agile environment[3][4].\n\nAnother key concept is workflow automation, which involves the use of tools and practices to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This automation is typically achieved through continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, which help businesses achieve shorter development cycles and faster time-to-market. Tools like GitLab CI/CD or Jenkins are widely used for creating and managing these pipelines, thus improving software quality and reducing human error[3][4].\n\nInfrastructure as code (IaC) is another critical element within DevOps, where infrastructure is managed and provisioned through code instead of manual processes. IaC enables consistent and repeatable configurations across environments, facilitates integration with CI/CD pipelines, and supports scalable infrastructure management. This approach ensures that infrastructure changes are aligned with software development, promoting efficiency and reducing the potential for configuration drift[11][12][5] .\n\nMoreover, the use of monitoring and logging practices within a DevOps framework is vital for maintaining system reliability and performance. These practices enable real-time analysis and proactive monitoring, allowing organizations to promptly address issues and ensure the delivery of reliable updates to customers[8]. Through these key concepts, DevOps empowers businesses to accelerate their cloud adoption journey, improve scalability, and maintain a competitive advantage in rapidly changing markets[4].\n\nDevOps Practices in Cloud Infrastructure\n\nDevOps practices play a crucial role in modern cloud infrastructure management by enabling organizations to achieve agility, collaboration, and efficiency throughout the cloud lifecycle. One of the foundational principles of DevOps in cloud environments is the implementation of infrastructure as code (IaC). IaC allows teams to define system resources and topologies in a descriptive manner, which can be stored and versioned in version control systems, offering a reliable, repeatable, and controlled way to deploy system resources[10][5] . This practice ensures that configurations are consistent across environments and can be easily edited and distributed[5] .\n\nAutomation is another pivotal element in DevOps practices, significantly enhancing scalability and efficiency. By fully automating infrastructure installation processes, organizations can eliminate the need for manual server provisioning, middleware building, and application code installation[13]. Tools such as AWS, Azure, GitLab, and Jira are commonly employed to overcome challenges associated with cloud automation, enabling businesses to enhance their scalability and monitoring capabilities[6].\n\nContinuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are also integral to DevOps practices, streamlining the build, testing, and deployment processes. Utilizing CI/CD tools like Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD, organizations can establish a seamless software delivery pipeline, facilitating frequent releases, faster feedback cycles, and improved software quality[3]. This automation minimizes human dependency for managing repetitive tasks, although some human oversight is still necessary when updates or troubleshooting are required[9].\n\nContainerization further simplifies deployment and management within cloud environments. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies into containers, businesses can achieve greater portability and resource utilization. Docker, for instance, allows containers to run on any infrastructure, ensuring consistent application performance across different environments[7].\n\nAchieving Scalability\n\nAchieving scalability in cloud infrastructure is a crucial component of DevOps practices. By leveraging containers, businesses encapsulate applications and their dependencies, which ensures portability and scalability while optimizing resource utilization[3]. This encapsulation simplifies the deployment and management of complex applications, allowing organizations to scale their operations effectively.\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) plays a vital role in scaling cloud infrastructure. IaC involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes, leading to more efficient and repeatable management of development, testing, and production environments[5] [8]. Tools like AWS CloudFormation enable developers to define and manage cloud resources, thus facilitating scaling beyond traditional infrastructure limitations[11].\n\nAutomation is another pivotal element in achieving scalability. Automation tools reduce the need for manual intervention, streamline processes, and allow for more efficient workload management[6][14]. This, in turn, helps DevOps teams increase efficiency and velocity, providing them with better control and visibility over their operations[14].\n\nFurthermore, adopting a microservices architectural style supports scalability. Microservices, characterized by small and independently deployable services, allow for continuous refactoring and scaling of individual services, which contributes to overall system efficiency and reliability[1]. This architectural style is becoming the standard for building systems that are continuously deployed, thus supporting organizational scalability[1].\n\nBest Practices for Automation and Scalability\n\nIn the context of cloud infrastructure management, automation and scalability are pivotal in ensuring efficient operations and fostering innovation. The integration of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) stands out as a primary practice in automating and managing infrastructure at scale. IaC enables developers and system administrators to manage infrastructure through code, treating it akin to application code, which promotes consistency and reduces the risk of human error[8][6]. This code-based approach allows for rapid deployment, updating, and duplication of infrastructure using standardized patterns, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages[8].\n\nOne of the foundational elements of DevOps is the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, which automates the build, test, and deployment processes. This approach streamlines software development, resulting in shorter development cycles and faster time-to-market[3]. The integration of IaC into CI/CD pipelines further enhances these processes by ensuring infrastructure changes are synchronized with software updates, leading to consistently reproducible configurations across different environments[11].\n\nAutomation tools such as AWS, Azure, GitLab, and Jenkins are instrumental in achieving scalability and efficiency in cloud infrastructure. These tools facilitate monitoring, scaling, and managing infrastructure resources, thereby helping businesses maintain a reliable system capable of promptly responding to customer needs and market demands[6][3]. Automation also aids in monitoring IT infrastructure performance, generating alerts for availability, performance, or security issues, which is critical for maintaining the integrity and functionality of fast-moving DevOps environments[9].\n\nAdditionally, embracing a DevOps culture that emphasizes collaboration, ownership, and accountability can improve team dynamics and operational efficiency[8]4]. This cultural shift supports the implementation of agile project management and continuous feedback loops, which are crucial for the evolution of DevOps in achieving both automation and scalability in cloud infrastructure[15].\n\nImpact of DevOps on Cloud Infrastructure Management\n\nThe integration of DevOps practices has significantly transformed cloud infrastructure management by emphasizing automation, collaboration, and scalability. DevOps practices eliminate the traditional need to manually provision servers, build middleware, and install application code, instead relying on automated processes that are documented, repeatable, verifiable, and traceable[13]. This automation not only accelerates infrastructure installation but also enhances reliability and efficiency in managing cloud environments[3].\n\nA fundamental aspect of DevOps is the adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which allows organizations to manage their development, testing, and production environments in a repeatable and efficient manner[8]. IaC minimizes human dependency for managing basic, recurring tasks, thereby reducing risks associated with manual interventions[9]. By implementing continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, organizations can ensure that all changes to code infrastructure and application updates are both safe and functional, promoting a seamless transition from development to production environments[4].\n\nMoreover, DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration among software developers and operations teams, which leads to improved processes that save both time and money[4]. This collaborative culture is supported by powerful tools for configuration management, containerization, and CI/CD, which together empower businesses to achieve greater agility and efficiency throughout the cloud lifecycle[3].\n\nDespite its advantages, the transformation to a DevOps model requires careful oversight and human intervention when necessary. Even well-automated processes can encounter unforeseen issues that necessitate human expertise to resolve[9]. Nevertheless, the emphasis on automation within DevOps remains a cornerstone of effective cloud infrastructure management, enabling organizations to scale their operations efficiently and respond promptly to customer needs[4][9].\n\nCase Studies\n\nAdoption of Automation in DevOps\n\nOne prominent case study illustrating the transformation brought by DevOps in cloud infrastructure management is that of a large-scale financial services firm. The organization faced challenges in managing complex systems and ensuring rapid deployment without compromising stability. By adopting DevOps practices, particularly focusing on automation, they achieved a more streamlined workflow. The implementation of automated testing\u2014encompassing unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests\u2014was pivotal in reducing deployment errors and improving the speed of delivery[15][16].\n\nThe firm utilized infrastructure as code to manage their environments, enabling them to replicate development, testing, and production setups efficiently. This approach not only reduced risks associated with system changes but also promoted consistency across environments[8]. As a result, the company experienced enhanced scalability in their cloud infrastructure, allowing them to adapt swiftly to changing demands.\n\nCultural Shift and Performance Metrics\n\nAnother case study involves an e-commerce company that embraced DevOps to overcome the inefficiencies inherent in their legacy systems. A crucial aspect of their transition was the cultural shift towards continuous communication and trust within teams. The company focused on breaking down silos and fostering a culture where ownership and accountability were emphasized[16][8].\n\nThe 2023 State of DevOps report noted that the company adopted updated performance metrics to better assess the effectiveness of their deployments. The switch from \u201cmean time to recover\u201d to \u201cfailed deployment recovery time\u201d provided clearer insights into their system\u2019s resilience, addressing previous ambiguities[1]. This metric adjustment was part of a broader strategy to implement Lean and Agile methodologies, contributing to the company\u2019s improved ability to respond to market demands swiftly.\n\nThese case studies exemplify how organizations have leveraged DevOps to enhance their cloud infrastructure management through automation and cultural transformation, achieving greater scalability and operational efficiency[17][1][8].\n\nFuture Trends in DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure\n\nThe future of DevOps in cloud infrastructure is poised for significant evolution, driven by the continuous advancements in automation and scalability. As organizations strive for greater agility and efficiency, the integration of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) will become even more prevalent. This approach allows teams to manage infrastructure using code, creating consistent and reliable environments while reducing human error through automation [6][8]. The adoption of IaC is expected to deepen, facilitating the deployment of infrastructure using standardized patterns that are repeatable, verifiable, and traceable [13].\n\nAutomation tools will continue to play a crucial role in managing complex environments at scale. With the increasing demand for seamless operations, these tools will help teams handle the velocity of changes characteristic of DevOps practices [8]. Furthermore, the use of containerization and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines will likely become more widespread, particularly with the rise of Kubernetes. Automating the processes of building, deploying, and monitoring containers will be essential, allowing teams to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management[10].\n\nMicroservices architecture is anticipated to become more dominant in the DevOps landscape, given its compatibility with continuous deployment systems. The modular nature of microservices allows for iterative and rapid development, aligning well with DevOps principles [1]. This architectural style will likely be complemented by serverless computing, which reduces the complexity of deployment and operations by eliminating the need for server configuration and maintenance [10].\n\nAs cloud providers continue to innovate, DevOps teams will benefit from enhanced services that streamline application lifecycles and accelerate product delivery. For example, AWS offers various services tailored for DevOps, enabling developers and system administrators to automate operational tasks efficiently [8][18]. The ongoing evolution of cloud services will empower organizations to maximize their cloud adoption journey and achieve sustainable success through DevOps[3].\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Wikipedia contributors.

Or rather, was.\n\nThe name itself translates as 'stone heap of the wildcat', with a modern name for the site being Gilgal Refa\u02beim which translates as 'Wheel of Ghosts' or Wheel of Spirits'.\n\nMade up of almost 40,000 tonnes of stone, it is estimated to have taken more than 25,000 combined working days to have put the megalith together.\n\nSpooky theories surrounding Rujm el-Hiri\n\nHaving been first discovered in 1967 during an archaeological survey, it was only then excavated in 2007.\n\nAdvert\n\nExperts have ruled out it being a burial site given that no human remains are on the site.\n\nBut some still theorise that astronomical connections are behind it, connected to ancient cultures observing the stars and planets while others think it could be linked to rituals and offerings to gods.\n\nRujm el-Hiri is in Syria, north of Israel (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\nRujm el-Hiri new findings\n\nIn a new study on the monument, published in the journal Remote Sensing, new satellite images of Rujm el-Hiri have been analysed by scientists from Tel Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe findings put doubt on links to astronomy and the stars.\n\nInstead, it has been confirmed that the structure has physically moved over time.\n\nDue to Earth's tectonic plates moving over time - we're talking eight to 15 millimetres every year for the last 150 million years - there has been significant alteration to the walls and entrances of the structure.\n\nAs a result, the site has moved counterclockwise and moved the entire monument by tens of metres.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt's moved over time (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\n\"The findings show that the entrances and radial walls during that historical period were entirely different, reopening the question of the site\u2019s purpose,\" the research team says.\n\n\"This implies that the primary axes of Rujm el-Hiri have rotated over time along with the entire region, casting significant doubt on the popular theory that Rujm el-Hiri was an observatory.\"\n\nThe outer walls of Rujm el-Hiri were built between 5,000BC and 4,500BC."

            "article_content": "Last month, on the night of Dec. 7, multiple pilots saw lights in the sky over the Willamette Valley.\n\nAs several outlets reported, an audio recording of air traffic control that went viral features alarm over the lights\u2019 strange movements among pilots of two commercial airliners, United Flight 1596 and Horizon Air Flight 2207, the latter of which had a pilot who reported having seen the same phenomenon \u201ca few times over the last month in the same area\u201d near Eugene.\n\nWhatever they were seeing, it wasn\u2019t showing up on air traffic control\u2019s radar. It was, however, appearing on the crash avoidance system of a small Life Flight plane, Medevac 1LF, heading toward North Bend. Its pilot, Joe Buley, gave the most detailed description:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one way up high and one about at my altitude. Moving in\u2026like a corkscrew pattern. Moving at\u2026extreme speeds... It\u2019s a red circular shape and it keeps zipping out towards the ocean and then coming back in, about 20 miles or closer to us and then zips back out of the ocean.\u201d\n\nThe response from air traffic control: \u201cYou are cleared to maneuver as necessary\u2014a left or right to avoid the UFO out there.\u201d\n\nThis incident was not, by any stretch of the imagination, the first time anybody\u2019s reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. This isn\u2019t even the first time that a United Airlines flight has reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. The region has been an epicenter of postwar UFO sightings, with more people having reported sightings in Portland and Seattle than in any other metro area in the United States since 2000. (The U.S. government now designates such sightings as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d or UAPs.)\n\nIt was here that on June 24, 1947, an amateur pilot named Kenneth Arnold set off a national frenzy after he reported seeing \u201cnine saucerlike aircraft flying in formation\u201d above Southwest Washington while flying from Chehalis to Yakima. (Thus, like \u201cgrunge\u201d and \u201cvegan strip club,\u201d \u201cflying saucer\u201d became a product of the Pacific Northwest.) Ten days later, the crew of United Flight 105 reported a nearly identical experience while flying from Boise to Pendleton.\n\nIn 1950, an Oregon couple named Paul and Evelyn Trent took two pictures on their Kodak of a \u201cdisc-shaped object\u201d that supposedly hovered above their farm outside of McMinnville without emitting any sound. The pictures ended up in Life magazine and remain a point of contention between UFO skeptics and believers.\n\nIn the 75 years since, there\u2019ve been thousands of reported sightings across the Pacific Northwest. Regardless of personal opinions of such things, it\u2019s undeniable that during this time UFOs and little green men have embedded themselves into the cultural fabric of the region, another stitch alongside New Age crystal healers, Bigfoot true believers, and whatever it is that draws people to a full-size replica of Stonehenge on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge. McMinnville and Chehalis both now hold annual UFO festivals; the Royal Canadian Mint issues a coin commemorating a 1970 sighting in British Columbia.\n\nWhat happened last month over the valley, though, was different from anything else that\u2019s come before. The Dec. 7 incident represented legitimate documentation of multiple professional pilots seeing the same things and having the same reaction to them. In that audio recording, an unnamed pilot aboard Horizon Air Flight 2207 can be heard refuting what\u2019s become the standard explanation for what they saw\u2014satellites. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not Starlink, I promise,\u201d he says. \u201cI know what that looks like.\u201d Buley, the pilot of Medevac 1LF, also doubts this explanation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen satellites\u2026stuff like that. This was definitely different,\u201d he told KEZI-TV. (WW reached out to Life Flight Network but was told that Buley and the rest of his crew have declined to speak further on the matter.)\n\nIt\u2019s all very strange. Perhaps the UFO believers are right after all. If they are, and this is a real thing, then the greatest story of all time has been playing out above our backyard. Or maybe it\u2019s nothing at all."

            "article_content": "Quantum space and time Physicists have developed no-go theorems that limit quantum processes in space\u2013time causality. (Courtesy: iStock/piranka)\n\nPhysicists have developed a new theoretical framework that helps make sense of how quantum processes are limited by the classical space\u2013time in which they are embedded. One of these processes is the quantum indefinite causal order (ICO), which is a puzzling consequence of quantum physics that has attracted a lot of attention and excitement lately. Quantum ICO systems could have applications in quantum technology, so gaining a better understanding of the phenomenon could have practical implications.\n\nIn a quantum ICO process, the temporal order of events is not fixed. Instead, the order is a quantum superposition of event A occurring before event B and event B happening before event A. Usually, such a statement is paradoxical: we are used to speaking about event A causing B, or vice-versa, but how can both be true simultaneously?\n\nWhile quantum ICO events have been demonstrated in the laboratory, they appear incompatible with the classical interpretation of space\u2013time causality that governs those experiments and indeed, the world that we live in. As a result, some physicists have cast doubt on whether ICO has actually been observed in the lab.\n\nBut now, V Vilasini and Renato Renner at ETH Zurich in Switzerland and the University of Grenoble in France have determined what conditions must hold for ICO processes to be possible in space\u2013time. Their result is cast in the language of a no-go theorem, which is a proof that, under certain assumptions, it is impossible for something to occur.\n\nBell\u2019s famous no-go theorem\n\nPerhaps the most famous no-go theorem in quantum physics is Bell\u2019s theorem. It was derived in 1964 by the Northern Irish physicist John Bell and concerns the purely quantum phenomenon of entanglement. Bell\u2019s no-go test establishes that the correlations observed between two entangled particles cannot be the result of any process of classical physics that obeys space\u2013time causality. Many Bell tests have been done in the laboratory using photons and other particles, and the results of these experiments are consistent with the quantum nature of entanglement. The Bell test has also been put to practical use in the E91 quantum cryptography protocol.\n\nBell\u2019s no-go theorem puts a limit on classical processes in space\u2013time causality. In their new work, Vilasini and Renner have created no-go theorems that limit quantum processes such as ICO in space\u2013time causality.\n\nThe first no-go result demonstrates that it is possible to embed a quantum ICO in classical space\u2013time, which is the space\u2013time we access in the laboratory \u2013 and experience on a day-to-day basis \u2013 provided that we do not require the involved systems to be localized in space\u2013time. These systems could, for example, be electrons or photons that are acting as the quantum bits (qubits) of a computation. Locality is the assumption that these particles are fixed at a particular location in space\u2013time, but Vilasini and Renner\u2019s result suggests that in order for the process to play out in classical space\u2013time, it cannot possess this property of locality.\n\nCyclicity and acyclicity\n\nCentral to their work is the notion of cyclicity, and the opposite notion of acyclicity. Acyclic space\u2013time does not contain cycles, meaning that one event cannot occur both before and after another event. ICO processes, on the other hand, are necessarily cyclic.\n\nTheir second no-go result says that any quantum ICO process that can be embedded in classical space\u2013time can be realized instead by a process that is acyclic. What this means is that we can achieve the same result of the ICO process by replacing it with a different process that is in fact acyclic. This is something like an unravelling, and referred to by Vilasini and Renner as \u201ccoarse graining\u201d.\n\nVilasini tells Physics World that there is a nice classical analogy: \u201cthe demand and price of a commodity may influence each other forming a cyclic causal structure, but upon a closer look this unravels into an acyclic structure where demand at time 1 influences price at time 2, which is greater than time 1, which in turn influences demand at time 3 and so on\u201d.\n\nQuantum ICO processes are not only important from a theoretical standpoint. They have been shown to be useful in a variety of tasks, ranging from refrigeration, or the cooling down of something, to reliable and noiseless communication between people. In particular, the use of quantum ICO\u2019s results in performances that are superior to those achieved by classical machines.\n\nFuture research in this field could improve our understanding of the interaction of ICOs and quantum gravity. While ICO processes have been studied in space\u2013times in which gravity and quantum effects play a role, it still remains for no-go results, akin to those of Vilasini and Renner\u2019s, to be worked out. This would shed light on the role of causality in quantum gravitational regimes, an area of research of pressing importance.\n\nThe research is described in Physical Review Letters and Physical Review A."

            "article_content": "In 1980, amid the turmoil of the Iranian Revolution, Katayoon \u201cKatie\u201d Dehesh fled Iran on a cold October night, leaving behind the life she knew.\n\nStaying would have provided physical safety but at the expense of her intellectual and personal freedom. She would have lost the freedom to teach, to learn, and to engage with the world beyond Iran\u2019s borders. Compelled by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and an unwavering desire to shape her own path, Dehesh embarked on a journey that would take her first to Germany and then to the United States, carrying with her a guiding mantra: be powerful.\n\nSince joining UC Riverside in 2016, Dehesh has led the Dehesh Lab as a distinguished professor and molecular biochemist, where she drives pioneering research in botany and plant sciences. As the Director of UC Riverside\u2019s Institute for Integrative Genome Biology, the holder of the Ernst and Helen Leibacher Endowed Chair, and a member of the German National Academy of Sciences, Dehesh has established herself as a leading figure in plant science.\n\nKatayoon \"Katie\" Dehesh, distinguished professor and molecular biochemist, discusses plant growth progress with a student in her lab on August 15, 2023. (UCR/Stan Lim)\n\nHer love for life \u2014 as well as her family, students, and for science \u2014 is palpable. That passion is what triggered her journey to freedom, one that she often recalls with picturesque memory.\n\n\u201cIt took four days by bus to reach the Turkish border, no flights were leaving Iran because of the Iran-Iraq war. We traveled at night with the headlights off. I was the only woman on board, and people assumed I was a prostitute,\u201d Dehesh said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t washed, gone 24 hours without food, and no hotel would rent me a room. When we reached Istanbul, I finally found a place to stay and barricaded the door with a bed. By dawn, I was buying my ticket to Germany, and I\u2019ve never looked back.\u201d\n\nStanding just above 5-feet, Dehesh\u2019s presence is grand. She walks in powerful strides and speaks with conviction. She did, after all, serve in the Iranian military, a requirement for working women with a Ph.D under the Shah. Though she initially dreamed of journalism, Dehesh\u2019s scientific journey took root during a university class trip to Maharloo Lake in southern Iran. Watching succulent plants thrive in saline waters, her curiosity sparked. This moment was the beginning of her fascination with plant biology.\n\n\u201cThe memory of those resilient succulent plants serves as a constant reminder of the boundless potential for discovery within the natural world. It underscores the power of nature to inspire and guide us toward our true callings,\u201d said Dehesh in a Q&A with the Association of American Universities, of which UCR is a member. \u201cFrom that moment forward, I embarked on a journey that would not only deepen my understanding of the botanical world but also lead to significant contributions in the field of plant biology.\u201d\n\nDehesh\u2019s passion for learning is contagious, and she is deeply committed to empowering women in science. She actively participates in conferences and collaborations aimed at supporting women, especially women of color, in scientific fields. She motivates her students too. In a recent lecture to 500 students, she paced the room, sparking discussions on lipids and membranes projected on large screens. Each time a student responded, she reinforced their confidence with a resounding \u201cPOWER!\u201d\n\nKatayoon \"Katie\" Dehesh, distinguished professor and molecular biochemist, teaches a biology class on lipids and membrane\u2014structure and function, on January 22, 2024. (UCR/Stan Lim)\n\nWithin her lab, Dehesh cultivates a culture of critical thinking, curiosity, and intellectual growth. Recently, she guided a discussion on plant senescence, challenging her lab members to think deeply about their hypotheses and methods. Her team describes her as a supportive mentor, encouraging them to balance their personal lives with their scientific pursuits.\n\n\u201cPersonal joy is as important as scientific joy,\u201d she often tells her team, embodying her belief in a balanced approach to life and work.\n\nDehesh\u2019s lab explores diverse topics, from understanding the breakdown of E. coli biofilms to uncovering how plants adapt to environmental stresses.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding flora is fundamental to understanding life across all species,\u201d she said, bridging insights from plant biology to broader ecological and interspecies connections. \u201cWe start with plants and move outward, exploring the fascinating overlaps and distinctions between plants and animals.\u201d\n\nKatayoon \"Katie\" Dehesh checks in with her lab team on August 15, 2023. (UCR/Stan Lim)\n\nHer commitment to diversity is central to her lab, where she brings together students from varied backgrounds and areas of expertise. Having experienced the challenge of adapting to new cultures, Dehesh values the richness of perspectives that diverse voices bring to academia.\n\nLeaving Iran meant accepting a permanent ban on returning, a price she willingly paid for the opportunity to pursue her dreams.\n\n\u201cAny success I achieve here comes with a responsibility to pay it forward,\u201d Dehesh said.\n\nThis commitment to mentorship inspires her to guide the next generation, encouraging them to overcome barriers and make meaningful contributions.\n\n\u201cIn the tapestry of life, resilience and adaptability are woven into success,\u201d Dehesh said. \u201cAs immigrants, our journeys are filled with both challenges and opportunities. Every hurdle you overcome is a steppingstone to your dreams. Embrace your experiences, they\u2019re the colors in our nation\u2019s mosaic. Believe in yourself, lift others as you climb, and let excellence guide you. In the U.S., the land of boundless possibilities, your journey stands as a testament to hope, perseverance, and achievement.\u201d\n\nKatayoon \"Katie\" Dehesh talks about her love for life, plants, and teaching. Her Riverside home has a garden that includes herbs, shrubs, and trees that remind her both of Iran and her journey in the United States. Photo taken on November 13, 2023.
