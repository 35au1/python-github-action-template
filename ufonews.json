AREA 51 is a highly classified US Air Force installation located in the state of Nevada. Its official name is the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), and it is primarily used to develop and test experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The base has sparked various conspiracy theories, particularly those involving alien technology and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), owing to its secrecy and the government's early denial of its existence. Area 51 is located in southern Nevada, about 83 miles (133 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas. It was established in the early 1950s and initially used for testing the U-2 spy plane during the Cold War. The US government did not formally recognise the existence of Area 51 until 2013 when the CIA published declassified papers. The site has been linked to a variety of conspiracy theories about extraterrestrial life and superior technology. Popular culture has contributed to the base's mystery, frequently portraying it as a hub for UFO encounters and alien research. Area 51 is surrounded by restricted airspace, making unauthorised access prohibited. The surrounding areas are monitored, and warning signs indicate the base's restricted status. The base is notable for testing military aircraft, such as stealth bombers and spy planes, as well as classified technology.\n\nBut he acknowledged that countries like China are starting to develop their own technologies.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, they\u2019ve moved on from copying to creating their own designs.\u201d\n\nAs the investigation continues and the mystery of Area 51 persists, the FBI raid has only intensified the speculation surrounding the base.\n\nArnu remains undeterred in his mission to uncover the truth, despite the challenges he faces from authorities.\n\nIn 2022, his home was raided by the FBI and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.\n\nAuthorities dispatched 25 agents to search his property, seizing computers, hard drives, and other electronic devices.\n\nThis operation was part of an investigation into potential breaches of national security, leaving many to wonder what sensitive information the researcher may have possessed.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t fully understand why it happened. I\u2019ve always worked within legal limits,\u201d Arnu said.\n\nDespite the challenges Arnu has faced, including the recent FBI raid, he remains determined to keep Area 51 research alive.\n\nTo ensure the next generation of enthusiasts continues exploring the mysteries of the base, he launched a YouTube channel dedicated to educating people about Area 51.\n\n\u201cI hope that my legacy inspires others to dig deeper into these mysteries,\u201d he said.\n\nHe hopes to equip younger researchers with the tools and knowledge they need to investigate the site.\n\nArnu\u2019s goal is to present factual, verifiable information, in contrast to the many conspiracy theories that flood the internet.\n\nHe said: \"There\u2019s all these conspiracy websites, but what my website wants to be - and what my YouTube channel wants to be - is just to show people the real deal.\n\n\"I want people to come out here, form their own opinions, and do their own research.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Arnu hopes that his work will inspire others to continue the search for truth at Area 51 while providing guidance on how to legally and safely pursue their curiosity.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou can come out here with binoculars, look at the base, no problem, but don\u2019t step across the border.\"\n\nWith new technologies potentially being developed behind its closed gates and a long history of secrecy, the base remains a hotbed of speculation.\n\nArnu\u2019s dedication to uncovering the mysteries and educating others will likely keep the spotlight on this enigmatic site for years to come.\n\nWhether it\u2019s alien technology, experimental aircraft, or classified military systems, the world is still eager to know what really lies within Area 51."

        "article_content": "The Pentagon has addressed the topic of UFOs and aliens again, and it\u2019s the same line we\u2019ve heard for decades. The government has been treating the subject with increasing legitimacy over the last few years. Still, officials continue to be extremely skeptical of the existence of extraterrestrials. Unfortunately, even with the formation of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which coordinates efforts to investigate UFO sightings across government agencies, no definitive evidence of aliens has been released.\n\nPentagon says no evidence of extraterrestrials visiting Earth exists\n\nAt a recent Pentagon press conference, press secretary Major General Pat Ryder addressed a question concerning the government\u2019s current stance on extraterrestrials.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Jeff Schogol of Task & Purpose asked, \u201cGiven the news cycle, you could announce anything about aliens or extraterrestrial life, and no one would care. So, I\u2019m just going to take the shot. What do you got on UFOs, aliens, etc.?\u201d\n\nIn response, Ryder stated, \u201cThe truth is out there, Jeff and the truth is, we have no evidence to indicate extraterrestrial life has visited the planet.\u201d\n\nDespite the formation of the AARO in 2022, all the evidence it\u2019s examined has been explained by natural phenomena or \u201cauthentic, sensitive national security programs,\u201d which were misinterpreted as being UFOs. However, its efforts to investigate claims are ongoing.\n\nRyder\u2019s recent response is the same one he gave in March 2024 when the last AARO report was released. In response to accusations that the military was hiding information from Congress about UFOs or extraterrestrials, he stated, \u201cWhat we found was that claims of hidden programs are largely the result of circular reporting by a small group repeating what they heard from others and that many people have sincerely misinterpreted real events for mistaking sensitive U.S. programs as UAP or being extra-terrestrial exploitation.\u201d\n\nSo, for now, the search continues.\n\nThe post Pentagon Addresses The Existence of UFOs and Aliens Once Again appeared first on Mandatory."

Now the horror movie studio behind the likes of Paranormal Activity, Five Nights at Freddy's and BlacKkKlansman is working with Meta to test Meta Movie Gen, the AI video generator that the owner of Facebook and Instagram revealed earlier this month. And that could be a scary combination.\n\nSelect creatives are taking part in the pilot, including Casey Affleck from I\u2019m Still Here and Light of My Life, Aneesh Chaganty, and the Spurlock Sisters, who are part of Blumhouse\u2019s first annual Screamwriting Fellowship. Aneesh has already produced a video using Meta's AI tool in which he says he was all against AI until he realised that his ten-year-old self would have loved it for his homemade movies.\n\nFor the video above, Aneesh used Meta Movie Gen to change the backdrops or add special effects to short movies he made as a kid \u201cI hate AI. But with a tool like this? I dunno\u2026 maybe I\u2019d have just dreamed a little bigger,\" he says, noting that what he likes about the tool is that \"little Aneesh would still have had to make the movie.\"\n\nIt's an emotive and clever plug for the tech that highlights its potential for human-led storytelling while also excusing the current limited quality of the AI output. I mean, sure, it is good enough for a kid's home movie. I would have been thrilled to have had access to this tech when I was a kid trying to produce Doctor Who episodes in the lunch break at primary school.\n\nBlumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum continues the tone in his statement in Meta's announcement. \u201cArtists are, and forever will be, the lifeblood of our industry,\u201d he says. \"Innovation and tools that can help those artists better tell their stories is something we are always keen to explore, and we welcomed the chance for some of them to test this cutting-edge technology and give their notes on its pros and cons while it\u2019s still in development.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThese are going to be powerful tools for directors, and it\u2019s important to engage the creative industry in their development to make sure they\u2019re best suited for the job.\u201d\n\nAs for Meta, it says Movie Gen will allow creatives to more quickly express ideas and \"explore visual direction, tone and mood.\u201d \u201cWe heard that filmmakers see potential for Movie Gen as a collaborator and thought partner, with its unexpected response to text prompts inspiring new ideas,\u201d it said.\n\nIt also seems that public access to Movie Gen might arrive sooner than we thought. Meta initially said it had no plans to open access \"anytime soon\". But CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted on Instagram to say Movie Gen would be coming to the platform next year (he made the announcement via a video of himself doing leg presses in different historical eras \u2013 you can see that gem below).\n\nA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) A photo posted by on\n\nConnor Hayes, VP of gen AI, has confirmed that timeframe. \u201cWhile we\u2019re not planning to incorporate Movie Gen models into any public products until next year, Meta feels it\u2019s important to have an open and early dialogue with the creative community about how it can be the most useful tool for creativity and ensure its responsible use,\u201d he said.\n\nMeta's collaboration with Blumhouse is another example of how studios are starting to take AI video generation seriously. It comes shortly after Runway entered into a deal to create a bespoke AI model for the film and TV producer Lionsgate.\n\nMeta says Movie Gen can currently create videos of up to 16 seconds in different aspect ratios and audio of up to 45 seconds and that it compares well against Runway, OpenAI's Sora and Kling. If it gets a release, Meta's AI video generator is also likely to compete against Adobe Firefly Video, which is already powering the new Generative Extend in Premiere Pro.\n\nIt's not clear how the model was trained, however. Meta has said that Movie Gen was trained on a \u201ca combination of licensed and publicly available datasets\u201d but hasn't specified which. Meta has access to vast amounts of video data through its products like Instagram and Facebook."

While you queue up your spooky movie marathon, here are 10 iconic horror movies from the past 70 years for inspiration, and what AP writers had to say about them when they were first released.\n\nMORE HALLOWEEN NEWS:\n\nWe resurrected excerpts from these reviews, edited for clarity, from the dead \u2014 did they stand the test of time?\n\n\"Rear Window\" (1954)\n\n\"Rear Window\" is a wonderful trick pulled off by Alfred Hitchcock. He breaks his hero's leg, sets him up at an apartment window where he can observe, among other things, a murder across the court. The panorama of other people's lives is laid out before you, as seen through the eyes of a Peeping Tom.\n\nJames Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter and others make it good fun.\n\n\u2014 Bob Thomas\n\n\"Halloween\" (1978)\n\nAt 19, Jamie Lee Curtis is starring in a creepy little thriller film called \"Halloween.\"\n\nUntil now, Jamie's main achievement has been as a regular on the \"Operation Petticoat\" TV series. Jamie is much prouder of \"Halloween,\" though it is obviously an exploitation picture aimed at the thrill market.\n\nThe idea for \"Halloween\" sprang from independent producer-distributor Irwin Yablans, who wanted a terror-tale involving a babysitter. John Carpenter and Debra Hill fashioned a script about a madman who kills his sister, escapes from an asylum and returns to his hometown intending to murder his sister's friends.\n\n\u2014 Bob Thomas\n\n\"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991)\n\n\"The Silence of the Lambs\" moves from one nail-biting sequence to another. Jonathan Demme spares the audience nothing, including closeups of skinned corpses. The squeamish had best stay home and watch \"The Cosby Show.\"\n\nTed Tally adapted the Thomas Harris novel with great skill, and Demme twists the suspense almost to the breaking point. The climactic confrontation between Clarice Starling and Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) is carried a tad too far, though it is undeniably exciting with well-edited sequences.\n\nSuch a tale as \"The Silence of the Lambs\" requires accomplished actors to pull it off. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are highly qualified. She provides steely intelligence, with enough vulnerability to sustain the suspense. He delivers a classic portrayal of pure, brilliant evil.\n\n\u2014 Bob Thomas\n\n\"Scream\" (1996)\n\nIn this smart, witty homage to the genre, students at a suburban California high school are being killed in the same gruesome fashion as the victims in the slasher films they know by heart.\n\nIf it sounds like the script of every other horror movie to come and go at the local movie theater, it's not.\n\nBy turns terrifying and funny, \"Scream\" \u2014 written by newcomer David Williamson \u2014 is as taut as a thriller, intelligent without being self-congratulatory, and generous in its references to Wes Craven's competitors in gore.\n\n\u2014 Ned Kilkelly\n\n\"The Blair Witch Project\" (1999)\n\nImaginative, intense and stunning are a few words that come to mind with \"The Blair Witch Project.\"\n\n\"Blair Witch\" is the supposed footage found after three student filmmakers disappear in the woods of western Maryland while shooting a documentary about a legendary witch.\n\nThe filmmakers want us to believe the footage is real, the story is real, that three young people died and we are witnessing the final days of their lives. It isn't. It's all fiction.\n\nBut Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick, who co-wrote and co-directed the film, take us to the edge of belief, squirming in our seats the whole way. It's an ambitious and well-executed concept.\n\n\u2014 Christy Lemire\n\n\"Saw\" (2004)\n\nThe fright flick \"Saw\" is consistent, if nothing else.\n\nThis serial-killer tale is inanely plotted, badly written, poorly acted, coarsely directed, hideously photographed and clumsily edited, all these ingredients leading to a yawner of a surprise ending. To top it off, the music's bad, too.\n\nYou could forgive all (well, not all, or even, fractionally, much) of the movie's flaws if there were any chills or scares to this sordid little horror affair.\n\nBut \"Saw\" director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell, who developed the story together, have come up with nothing more than an exercise in unpleasantry and ugliness.\n\n\u2014 David Germain\n\nGermain gave \"Saw\" one star out of four.\n\n\"Paranormal Activity\" (2009)\n\nThe no-budget ghost story \"Paranormal Activity\" arrives 10 years after \"The Blair Witch Project,\" and the two horror movies share more than a clever construct and shaky, handheld camerawork.\n\nThe entire film takes place at the couple's cookie-cutter dwelling, its layout and furnishings indistinguishable from just about any other readymade home constructed in the past 20 years. Its ordinariness makes the eerie, nocturnal activities all the more terrifying, as does the anonymity of the actors adequately playing the leads.\n\nThe thinness of the premise is laid bare toward the end, but not enough to erase the horror of those silent, nighttime images seen through Micah's bedroom camera. \"Paranormal Activity\" owns a raw, primal potency, proving again that, to the mind, suggestion has as much power as a sledgehammer to the skull.\n\n\u2014 Glenn Whipp\n\nWhipp gave \"Paranormal Activity\" three stars out of four.\n\n\"The Conjuring\" (2013)\n\nAs sympathetic, methodical ghostbusters Lorraine and Ed Warren, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson make the old-fashioned haunted-house horror film \"The Conjuring\" something more than your average fright fest.\n\n\"The Conjuring,\" which boasts incredulously of being their most fearsome, previously unknown case, is built very in the '70s-style mold of \"Amityville\" and, if one is kind, \"The Exorcist.\" The film opens with a majestic, foreboding title card that announces its aspirations to such a lineage.\n\nBut as effectively crafted as \"The Conjuring\" is, it's lacking the raw, haunting power of the models it falls shy of. \"The Exorcist\" is a high standard, though; \"The Conjuring\" is an unusually sturdy piece of haunted-house genre filmmaking.\n\n\u2014 Jake Coyle\n\nCoyle gave \"The Conjuring\" two and half stars out of four.\n\n\"Get Out\" (2017)\n\nFifty years after Sidney Poitier upended the latent racial prejudices of his white date's liberal family in \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,\" writer-director Jordan Peele has crafted a similar confrontation with altogether more combustible results in \"Get Out.\"\n\nIn Peele's directorial debut, the former \"Key and Peele\" star has \u2014 as he often did on that satirical sketch series \u2014 turned inside out even supposedly progressive assumptions about race. But Peele has largely left comedy behind in a more chilling portrait of the racism that lurks beneath smiling white faces and defensive, paper-thin protestations like, \"But I voted for Obama!\" and \"Isn't Tiger Woods amazing?\"\n\nIt's long been a lamentable joke that in horror films \u2014 never the most inclusive of genres \u2014 the Black dude is always the first to go. In this way, \"Get Out\" is radical and refreshing in its perspective.\n\n\u2014 Jake Coyle\n\nCoyle gave \"Get Out\" three stars out of four.\n\n\"Hereditary\" (2018)\n\nIn Ari Aster's intensely nightmarish feature-film debut \"Hereditary,\" when Annie (Toni Collette), an artist and mother of two teenagers, sneaks out to a grief-support group following the death of her mother, she lies to her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) that she's \"going to the movies.\"\n\nA night out with \"Hereditary\" is many things, but you won't confuse it for an evening of healing and therapy. It's more like the opposite.\n\nAster's film, relentlessly unsettling and pitilessly gripping, has carried with it an ominous air of danger and dread: a movie so horrifying and good that you have to see it, even if you shouldn't want to, even if you might never sleep peacefully again.\n\nThe hype is mostly justified.\n\n\u2014 Jake Coyle\n\nCoyle gave \"Hereditary\" three stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nResearcher Rhonda Shafner contributed from New York."

        "article_content": "Dwarf planet Ceres (Credit: NASA/JPL-CalTech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA)\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \u2014 A dwarf planet hiding right in the middle of our solar system could be a surprising source of frozen water, astronomers reveal. A new study finds that Ceres, which sits in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, has a crust that\u2019s 90% ice. The discovery of this dirty ice crust has led scientists to believe this giant asteroid used to be a muddy water world. Astronomers have studied Ceres since it was first discovered in 1801. It is both a dwarf planet and the largest asteroid in our solar system. The protoplanet is spherical, with a diameter of approximately 590 miles, and is riddled with craters, volcanoes, and landslides. In 2007, NASA sent the Dawn spacecraft to study Ceres. It reached the dwarf planet in 2015 and orbited it until 2018. While examining the rough surface, astronomers ruled out any signs of water existing on the asteroid because of the visible craters all over the surface. The common belief was that Ceres is relatively dry, with less than 30% ice.\n\nHowever, the new study, published in the journal Nature Astronomy, argues that scientists might have judged this crater-rich planetoid too soon. The way the craters formed and the planet\u2019s mass suggest an ice-rich environment. Using spectrographic data from the Dawn mission and computer simulations, the researchers noticed that there may be ice in Ceres\u2019s subsurface. Gravity data also showed a density value close to that of impure ice. \u201cWe think that there\u2019s lots of water-ice near Ceres surface, and that it gets gradually less icy as you go deeper and deeper,\u201d says Mike Sori, an assistant professor in Purdue University\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, in a media release. \u201cPeople used to think that if Ceres was very icy, the craters would deform quickly over time, like glaciers flowing on Earth, or like gooey flowing honey. However, we\u2019ve shown through our simulations that ice can be much stronger in conditions on Ceres than previously predicted if you mix in just a little bit of solid rock.\u201d The researchers mapped out a geographical profile of an actual crater from Ceres and used the information to create computer simulations. The computer simulations modeled how the dwarf planet\u2019s craters relax and deform over billions of years. (Credit: Purdue University)\n\nAccording to the authors, the findings suggest Ceres was once a frozen ocean world similar to one of Jupiter\u2019s moons, Europa. The muddy ocean froze over time, creating an icy crust with some trapped rock. The ice-rich crust had found some way to resist crater relaxation. \u201cTo me the exciting part of all this, if we\u2019re right, is that we have a frozen ocean world pretty close to Earth,\u201d adds Sori. \u201cCeres may be a valuable point of comparison for the ocean-hosting icy moons of the outer solar system, like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus.\u201d The new findings could also warrant a manned space mission to the crater-rich dwarf planet as it may be one of the best chances astronauts have to visit an icy world. \u201cSome of the bright features we see at Ceres\u2019 surface are the remnants of Ceres\u2019 muddy ocean, now mostly or entirely frozen, erupted onto the surface. So we have a place to collect samples from the ocean of an ancient ocean world that is not too difficult to send a spacecraft to,\u201d Sori concludes."

The animated doodle shows a Staurikosaurus swiftly traversing an ancient landscape, highlighting its speed and agility. It also shows the dinosaur's distinctive long tail and bipedal stance, along with serrated teeth hinting at its predatory nature.\n\nDiscovery details\n\nStaurikosaurus: A significant find in dinosaur evolution\n\nPaleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Prince first discovered the Staurikosaurus in 1936, at the Santa Maria Formation in southern Brazil. Radiocarbon dating techniques have established that this ancient predator lived during the late Triassic period, some 225 million years ago. The dinosaur was relatively large for its time, measuring about two meters long and weighing around 30kg. Its bipedal stance and long tail indicate a fast-moving predator who was well-equipped to catch and hold prey.\n\nEvolutionary significance\n\nCrucial piece in the dinosaur evolution puzzle\n\nThe discovery of Staurikosaurus has been instrumental in furthering our understanding of dinosaur evolution. By studying this early theropod, paleontologists have been able to put together the puzzle of how these creatures first appeared on Earth and embarked on their remarkable journey. The Staurikosaurus continues to inspire awe and wonder, reminding us of the diversity and complexity of life that has existed on our planet."
