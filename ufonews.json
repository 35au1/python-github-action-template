These sightings continued for 17 days, prompting suspicions that Russian or Chinese agents might be involved.On January 6, 2024, a clue emerged when a Chinese student at the University of Minnesota, Fengyun Shi, was caught flying a drone near Langley. His drone, which had photographed Navy ships, was abandoned after getting stuck in a tree. Shi was arrested a week later as he prepared to board a flight to China and was charged with unlawfully photographing classified naval installations.While US officials have confirmed similar drone swarms near Edwards Air Force Base in Nevada, the Defence Department has yet to publicly identify those behind these apparent surveillance efforts."

An altered photo of Bryre was among them.\n\nIt was a picture of the teen and her friend at the beach that Bryre had posted to her social media account when she was 16 years old, but the picture had been altered to remove the girls\u2019 bathing suits and showed them appearing nude. The picture was the same as the one she had posted except for the nudity, and although Bryre knew it had been digitally altered, she was shocked and horrified at how real it looked.\n\n\u201cOnce I saw the picture it was just really confusing, how it was so realistic, and I was like, why?

There is a display with exorcism chairs examining \u201clevels of demonic ownership,\u201d a seance exhibition and a doll room which Crimi said sees \u201cthe most paranormal activity\u201d of any space in the museum.\n\n\u201cSometimes things will move,\u201d Crimi said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s demonic, necessarily. I think it\u2019s just, you know, activity \u2026Children love to also go into dolls. People like to go into dolls. So it\u2019s just a way of the spirits feeling happy.\u201d\n\nAs word has spread about the eerie museum, its number of visitors have grown to 500 each weekend, Crimi said. Visitors travel across the nation and internationally to see VAMPA\u2019s collection of antique vampire killing sets, the largest in the world.\n\nCrimi said they\u2019ve benefitted from the widespread cultural appeal of the paranormal \u2014 an interest which, for all the technological advancements of the 21st century, is still as compelling to many people as it was in the Dark Ages.\n\n\u201cPeople are fascinated by what they don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been a fact of life. People are searching and trying to understand life as they\u2019re trying to deal with the concept of death.\u201d\n\nThe various objects in the museum\u2019s collection are sinister, but what makes the site special is the presence of \u201ca little girl by name of Abigail,\u201d Crimi said.\n\nCrimi has lived on the property for more than 30 years. He said during that time, employees often argued amongst themselves over who had spilled the milk, and his own daughters, when they were young, would accuse each other of having drank the milk.\n\n\u201cThis was a dairy farm, so we think there\u2019s a correlation with Abigail and milk, and we still have experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cEven last week, I poured milk for the cats, and within two minutes, the cats weren\u2019t even in the room, half the milk was gone.\u201d\n\nCrimi said that unlike other, more negative experiences he\u2019s had with paranormal activity, which he declined to share, Abigail is \u201cnot demonic in any sense of imagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s more mischievous,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a little girl, so she likes to play.\u201d\n\nInvestigation into Abigail and other paranormal activity on the VAMPA Museum property is one of the subjects of a two-part documentary, \u201cParanormal Pickers,\u201d featuring Crimi and paranormal investigator Eric Mintel and his team. It premiered at Doylestown\u2019s County Theater on Oct. 11.\n\nCrimi said putting all the spookiness of the museum aside, he sees it as a family-friendly experience that emphasizes goodness in the world.\n\nThere\u2019s a room in the museum dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel and his battle against the devil \u2014 a room which Crimi said is his favorite because it helps express the museum\u2019s central focus: \u201cHow to fight evil.\u201d\n\nEven objects like carved skeletons aren\u2019t necessarily meant to be scary, Crimi said. The Stoics, for example, displayed skulls with the Latin phrase, \u201cMemento Mori\u201d \u2014 \u201dRemember you will die\u201d \u2014 as an affirmation of life.\n\nCrimi said the museum has donated to St. Jude\u2019s Hospital for Children and other charitable causes, and he wants to continue to grow their community impact in the coming years.\n\nThe museum is open year-round, Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. \u2013 5 p.m., and by appointment during the week. Admission is $15 for adults, $8 for children ages 6-17 and free for children under 6. Information about upcoming events and special ticketed experiences can be found on VAMPA\u2019s Instagram."

        "article_content": "LEICESTER \u2014 Legend has it, somewhere in a small private Quaker cemetery in a secluded area of Kettle Brook Reservoir lies a series of portals that lead straight to hell.\n\nFriends Cemetery dates back to the 1700s and is better known by its nickname, Spider Gates, named after the distinctive iron entryway. The iconic gates were put in place in 1895 and have been replaced at least once after being taken without permission. Today, the gates are gone. They were moved to the Leicester Historical Society for safekeeping after several incidents of vandalism and graffiti.\n\nOver the years, the gates that welcome visitors have become a draw in itself. The Leicester Historical Commission is in discussion as to how to best put them back on public display while protecting them at the same time.\n\n\"We're going to complete the restoration of the carriage/summer house located at the Swan Tavern-Leicester Historical Museum by spring 2025 and when that is done, we will decide between one of two plans on where to place them on public display along with a history of the Quakers in Leicester,\" said Joe Lennerton of the Leicester Historical Commission.\n\nWhile most \"spooky\" places have a singular terrifying tale, a monster in the woods, a legendary curse, Spider Gates has all of the above and more, it seems.\n\nAn oak tree, known as the Hanging Tree, is said to be haunted by the ghost of someone who took their own life by hanging. Strange white ooze has been seen seeping from the ground and small stones with strange runes have been found just outside the walls of the cemetery.\n\nNearby, there is said to be a cave where a young woman was murdered decades ago. A river runs nearby and is said to actually be the river Styx, which leads to the underworld.\n\nApparently, another cemetery appears across the street and can only be seen once. And if you listen, visitors have heard a demonic creature roaming the woods.\n\nFinally, if one where to visit the gravestone of Marmaduke Earle at midnight and rest their head on it, legend has it, he will speak to whomever dares get that close.\n\nBut what's the real story? The cemetery is taken care of by a group of Quakers, called the Worcester Friends Meeting, who continue to use the land as a cemetery to this day.\n\n\"We just want the public to treat this cemetery the way one would treat the cemetery their own family members are buried in,\" Karen Sargent of the Worcester Friends Meeting said. \"I didn't grow up with the stories surrounding the cemetery and I've heard several, but like anything, it's like watching scary movies, some people just like to be scared.\"\n\nThere are a few rules for the cemetery. The land is closed from dusk until dawn and paranormal investigations are not permitted.\n\nThat doesn't stop people visiting, lured by the legends. April Kitchen is originally from Norwich, Connecticut, but spends her time traveling the country in her RV, visiting interesting places.\n\n\"I'm always looking for new places to go and experiences to be had,\" she said. \"I typically Google search 'things to do near me' and go from there. Since Halloween is coming up, I included 'spooky' as a keyword for a specific experience.\"\n\nKitchen visited the cemetery twice last month: once in the evening with her daughter and again the following day with her husband.\n\n\"I would definitely say the feel of the cemetery and surrounding area was spookier in the evening compared with midday,\" she said. \"Maybe it was because that time it was just my daughter and me alone, maybe it was the failing light. Lots of sounds in the woods. Both of us thought we saw another cemetery area down the path that leads to the river but didn't go down there. The next day we did walk the path and there was no second cemetery, only a path and the river. I later read some lore for Spider Gates that says you will see a second cemetery once and then never again. So, who knows, maybe that's what that was.\"\n\nThat's not all. Kitchen said she heard \"what sounded like a woman's voice by the river on the second day,\" adding it may have just been the water playing tricks.\n\nOutside of the potentially paranormal, Kitchen said walking through the cemetery, it was noticeably well cared for and it was the large sections of families buried together that caught her attention.\n\n\"You think about what their lives were like. Who they were, and the things they did. And that love of family led them to end up laid to rest together.\"\n\nThe first person buried was John Potter in 1740, one of the earliest Quakers to settle in the area. The most recent grave was filled about a month ago.\n\nSargent said members of the Worcester Friends Meeting and the Southwick family are buried within, adding members of the public must request to be buried at the cemetery.\n\nSeveral notable people are buried within, according to Lennerton. Pliny Earle built the first functioning carding machine in North America, while his son, Dr. Pliny Earle Jr., paid to restore the cemetery in the late 1800s.\n\n\"Also of note,\" Lennerton said. \"Admiral Ralph Earle, graduate of Annapolis and later chief of the bureau of naval ordnance.\" And finally, Leicester native Stephen Earle, the architect behind the Leicester Public Library and Bancroft Tower, Boynton Hall at WPI and the Union Congregational Church on Chestnut Street in Worcester.\n\nA special thank you to Anne for her suggestion of Friends Cemetery and the legends surrounding Spider Gates for this week's edition of Worcester County Wonders.\n\nT&G engagement editor Sarah Barnacle is getting to know Central Mass. by exploring some of the best places to go and things to do in Worcester County.

        "article_content": "Since the Nobel Prizes were created in 1901, just 24 women have received awards in the sciences. This year, that number stayed the same: All seven laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine were men.\n\nSome scientists have expressed frustration about the lack of women among this year\u2019s awardees, particularly the omission of two women who contributed to the work honored for the prize in physiology or medicine. Experts who study gender bias in the sciences say the Nobel\u2019s gender gap reflects the larger barriers to success faced by women in science \u2014 and that science is poorer for it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe men who received this year\u2019s prizes are \u201csuperstars,\u201d said Liselotte Jauffred, a physicist at the Niels Bohr Institute who has studied gender bias in the Nobels. But \u201cwhat are the mechanisms that make it easier for men to enter that pool of superstar scientists that could even be nominated for a Nobel Prize?\u201d\n\nCertain fields, like biology, chemistry and social sciences are reaching gender parity in undergraduate and graduate degrees. But representation falls further up the academic ladder \u2014 a problem known as the leaky pipeline. Some women are pushed out of science altogether because of experiences of sexism. Those who persist are less often promoted to senior professorships, and even fewer become chief physicians, department heads, or journal editors.\n\nEven once in academia, women are not given tenure as often as men. They are not listed as the key author on as many papers, are cited less often than male colleagues, and receive fewer prestigious awards overall.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFiguring out whether the Nobels reflect even more bias than academia as a whole was \u201cnot easy\u201d Jauffred said. Researchers had to account for the lag between when a discovery is made and when it is recognized, and for the lower representation of women in science over the years. But even when accounting for those factors, she and her colleagues found in a 2019 study that the likelihood that bias against women played a role in the decision of who gets awards was around 96%.\n\nThis year\u2019s Nobel for physiology or medicine, which was awarded to Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros for the discovery of microRNA, has attracted particular scrutiny with regard to gender bias. Many outside observers commented on the fact that Rosalind Lee, Ambros\u2019 wife and long-time collaborator, was not recognized for the discovery despite being a first author on one of the studies cited by the committee. To some, the story seemed to write itself \u2014 another Rosalind overlooked by the committee, much like Rosalind Franklin, whose contributions to the discovery of DNA\u2019s double helix were not initially recognized.\n\nThere are, however, reasons beyond sexism that can lead collaborators like Lee to get overlooked. The Nobel committee limits awards to three people, which some scientists have pointed out is an antiquated way to reward discoveries that are increasingly part of large collaborations.\n\n\u201cAny project of any complexity rolls out over years with many contributors,\u201d said Bruce Wightman, a biologist at Muhlenberg College who was in Ruvkun\u2019s lab and worked on an aspect of the discovery of microRNA. \u201cScience takes a village.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for UMass Chan Medical School said Lee and Ambros are \u201ccelebrating the Nobel Prize and view it as a recognition of the team\u2019s collaborative work.\u201d\n\nThe push to reduce gender bias in Nobel Prizes\n\nThat said, how credit is distributed to scientists that are part of a large collaboration may also be the product of bias. One study found that women who co-authored papers were less likely to receive tenure compared to those who published papers alone. This kind of collaboration didn\u2019t have any effect on men\u2019s ability to get tenure. Another found that women tended to receive authorship on papers or patents to which they had contributed less often than male colleagues.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Nobels tend to \u201crecognize people who were in a position of power and authority, instead of the people who actually made a discovery or had an idea or proved it experimentally,\u201d said Pnina Abir-Am, a historian of science at Brandeis University, who has studied collaborative couples in science as well as documented the women who were not recognized for the Nobel prize for RNA splicing.\n\nNewsletter Weekdays Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Sign Up Your data will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. You may opt out of receiving STAT communications at any time.\n\nThe Nobel committee is often \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d in who it gives awards to, Abir-Am said, favoring those who are heads of the lab where the research was conducted as well as those who have trained with other Nobel laureates. That means lower chances of receiving the prize for women, racial minorities, and more junior scientists who have made breakthrough discoveries but are less likely to be in positions of power.\n\nNobel winners also tend to come from socioeconomically privileged backgrounds, according to Paul Novosad, an economist at Dartmouth College who studies access to opportunity and upward mobility. Novosad and his colleagues published a white paper this week finding that on average, laureates came from households with fathers in the 87th percentile of income in their country. Around half were in the top 5% by income.\n\nFemale laureates tended to be from even more elite families, which the authors write may be because the higher socioeconomic status helps them overcome some of the gendered obstacles in academia. But \u201cit means that elite women in the sciences are drawn from an even smaller socioeconomic pool than men, implying substantial misallocation,\u201d they write in the paper.\n\n\u201cIf children who are brilliant but poor fail to make it into the sciences, then all of humanity loses out on their potential discoveries,\u201d said Novosad.\n\nThings may be changing. The analysis found that the average socioeconomic status of laureates is creeping downward, which could signal a slow democratization of the sciences. \u201cThis kind of research is really important for the same reasons that we would like to see less elite demographics represented in various top positions,\u201d said Novosad. \u201cUnfortunately there is still a surprising amount of work to do just to convince men in senior scientific positions that these barriers exist at all.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne change that may make recognition more fair going forward is the growing practice of papers delineating what each author has contributed to a paper. \u201cJournals require scientists to say who contributed to conception and who contributed to experiments,\u201d Abir-Am said. This creates less ambiguity around who directly contributed to discoveries that are being honored by awards \u2014 as opposed to assuming lab heads or senior authors did the lion\u2019s share of the work. \u201cI don\u2019t care who is a director and who is a junior [researcher], I want to know who did what.\u201d\n\nThe organizations that select Nobel laureates have taken steps to address the laureates\u2019 lack of diversity in recent years. In 2019, Nobel committees began asking nominators to consider gender and ethnicity to encourage a wider range of diversity in nominees. And since scientists have to be invited to contribute nominations, \u201c[w]e are extending invitations to an increasing number of individuals from regions beyond traditional academic research hubs in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan,\u201d Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, told Nature this week. \u201cMoreover, we\u2019re actively identifying more women and younger scientists as nominators.\u201d\n\nJauffred has also seen improvement. She was motivated to write her paper on gender bias in the Nobels after Donna Strickland in 2018 became the first woman to win the Nobel in physics in 55 years. Since 2018, two more women have also won the Nobel in physics. Still, progress is slow.\n\n\u201cThe demography of fields has been changing for a long time, but it\u2019s not yet reflected in Nobel Prizes,\u201d Jauffred said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t see that diversity represented in the Nobel Prizes, of course we ask ourselves questions. Why does it have to be like that?\u201d\n\nMegan Molteni contributed reporting."

However, they lacked the cupule which was common in most seeds of the period. This prompted scientists to determine that the variety was 40 million years older that what was previously estimated.\n\nAlasemenia has a coat that is extends outward and forms wing-like lobes. The broad and convex structure of these wings helped the seeds to fly in the wind. The research notes that three-winged seeds of Alasemenia were adapted better to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two or four wings.\n\nAccording to the published study, experts compared Alasemenia against two other known winged seeds from the Late Devonian period. Both Warstenia and Guazia had four wings. While the former\u2019s wings were short and straight, the latter\u2019s were broad and flat."

        "article_content": "Enterprise automation and AI company UiPath takes its annual user symposium back to Las Vegas this month and we\u2019ll be drilling into the news stream to work out the next phase in accelerated automation.\n\nWhat was data mining and proces mining became Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\u2026 and what was RPA became enterprise automation and AI\u2026 what happens next is the evolution of enterprise automation to become agentic AI\u2026 and this will surely feature as a central theme for the event.\n\nWhat is agentic AI? According to UiPath, agentic AI is a combination of different AI techniques, models and approaches to create autonomous agents that analyse data, set goals and take action with minimal human supervision and near-human cognition and continuous learning. \u201cAgentic AI achieves this level of cognition by employing a combination of advanced AI techniques, including large language models (LLMs), machine learning algorithms, deep learning and reinforcement learning. For example, LLMs, like those that power OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Meta Llama, are employed to allow autonomous systems to understand and respond to natural language commands. Machine learning algorithms enable these systems to analyse data and identify patterns. Reinforcement learning techniques allow them to learn from their actions and improve their decision-making over time,\u201d notes UiPath, on its about pages. Forward is taking place at the MGM Grand Las Vegas Oct. 21-24, 2024. The event\u2019s theme \u201cTransform with AI\u201d aims to underscore the importance of AI in both business strategy and technological performance. This year, Forward is is complemented this year by TechEd, a curated agenda designed for the leaders and practitioners charged with turning the vision for AI-powered automation into real-world impact. Forward + TechEd feature more than 60 sessions featuring over 200 expert speakers, attendees can explore the ways enterprise automation and AI are transforming business processes and industry use cases. The event features presentations by automation experts from organisations such as Amgen, Cox Enterprises, Johnson Controls, Paychex, Prudential Financial, USI Insurance Services and Whirlpool Corporation, among others."
