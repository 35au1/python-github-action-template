        "article_content": "Netflix\u2019s \u2018Unsolved Mysteries: The Roswell UFO Incident\u2019 sheds light on the controversial Roswell UFO crash incident of 1947. On one hand, the government allegedly covered up the truth by claiming that it was an experimental balloon aircraft that crashed. On the other hand, UFO enthusiasts believed that in addition to the crashing of an actual UFO, bodies of aliens were also recovered. The episode consists of in-depth interviews with some of the experts in the field, including Donald Schmitt, who shared his opinion on the subject.\n\nDonald Schmitt Has Achieved Many Things in the Field of UFOs\n\nDonald Raymond Schmitt\u2019s journey to success was not short or easy. After graduating from Hartford Union High School, he earned his Bachelor\u2019s degree from Concordia University Wisconsin. He also attended Milwaukee Area Technical College for higher studies. Given his interest in UFOs and related subjects, he organized five archaeological dig projects at the 1947 Rowell crash site, with the first one in 1989. The next two digs came after more than a decade, in 2002, followed by 2006. The previous two digs were conducted in 2013 and 2016. His efforts were so impressive that the central theme of \u2018The Roswell Crash: Startling New Evidence\u2019 was based on the second dig.\n\nIn the 1970s, Donald used to work as a special investigator for the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the art director for the International UFO Reporter and the scientific consultant to the Air Force Project Blue Book. So, when the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies in Chicago was founded, he became the Director of Special Investigations and retired from the post after serving for a decade. Apart from being a member of Holy Hill Basilica Choir, he was also the president of Hartford Community Chorus at some point. Donald was also employed at Bloom and Associates as an art director/consultant and at Stellar Productions. Formerly, he was also the Wisconsin State Director of MUFON.\n\nInterestingly, he also co-produced the 2020 documentary titled \u2018The Phenomenon,\u2019 which is centered on the unidentified aerial phenomenon. Starting in 2019, he is a co-founder of the International Coalition on Extraterrestrial Research (ICER), where he serves as the North American Representative. Furthermore, he is currently the co-founder of the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico. There, he is appointed as a board advisor and a lead investigator.\n\nDonald Schmitt Has Written Numerous Best-Selling Books\n\nDonald R. Schmitt has also dabbled in the field of writing and has authored several books. The former special investigator published his debut book, \u2018UFO Crash at Roswell\u2019 in 1991, sharing the title of co-author with Kevin D. Randle. Chronicling the 1947 Roswell UFO incident, the book garnered several eyeballs and ended up getting adapted into a movie for the screen by Arthur L. Kopit and Jeremy Kagan for the latter\u2019s movie, \u2018Roswell.\u2019 Starring Kyle MacLachlan and Martin Sheen in pivotal roles, the 1994 film also earned a nomination for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television at the Golden Globes in 1995. Interestingly, the Golden Globe nod is what Donald considers his most remarkable accomplishment in life.\n\nOver the years, he has made great strides in the world of writing by not only penning his observations in articles but also full-fledged books. Another of his books, \u2018Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the 60-Year Cover-Up,\u2019 which he co-authored with Thomas J. Carey, sat on the throne of the top-selling UFO-themed book across the globe for two years \u2014 2007 and 2008. According to reports, Stellar Productions has optioned the book for the movie, \u2018Majic Men.\u2019 Donald has earned the title of best-selling author not once nor twice but seven times (author/co-author) for many of his titles, such as \u2018The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell,\u2019 \u2018Roswell: The Chronological Pictorial,\u2019 \u2018The Children of Roswell,\u2019 and \u2018Inside the Real Area 51.\u2019 Not just that, Donald has also graced the television screens to share his insight on all things UFO by featuring on \u2018Oprah,\u2019 \u2018CBS 48 Hours,\u2019 \u2018Larry King Live,\u2019 and many more.\n\nDonald Schmitt And His Wife Lead a Private Yet Fulfilling Married Life\n\nThough the professional life of Donald R Schmitt is in the public eye, the personal aspects are something he prefers to keep private. He has been blessed with the companionship of his lovely wife of many years, Marie, and together they have weaved a beautiful life with love, compassion, and understanding. The investigative author has never hesitated to profess his affection and gratitude for his wife for all the support and faith she has shown for and in him since they tied the knot.\n\nIn fact, a testament to that would be the heartwarming shout-out he gave the love of his life in the Acknowledgement section of his 2017 book, titled \u2018Cover-Up at Roswell: Exposing the 70-Year Conspiracy to Suppress the Truth.\u2019 It read: \u201cAnd finally, I will shout it from the highest roof that I am truly blessed with a wife who loves me for being me.\u201d Apart from the fact that his father passed on before his mother, Viola, not much is known about his familial life. As of writing, Donald and his wife seemingly reside in their peaceful ranch in the small community of Hubertus in Washington County, Wisconsin.\n\nRead More: Kevin Randle: Where is the Ufologist Now?"

        "article_content": "Polygon\u2019s Editor\u2019s Letter is a column from Editor-in-Chief Chris Plante that reflects on the video game and entertainment industries, their communities, and Polygon itself. New editions appear in the first week of each month.\n\nLast month, I wrote about how the endless stream of \u201ctoo many games\u201d has caused existential problems for game makers. This month, I\u2019ll focus on the other side of the equation: the audience. The people who play all of these new games. Or, as a recent survey tells us, the people who don\u2019t play them.\n\nAbundance should be a boon for the average video game fan. Unfettered competition pushes prices down, particularly on PC, where each month players can grab bundles containing dozens (sometimes hundreds) of games for less than $20. And even the fanciest, freshest games often get discounted within weeks of launch.\n\nBetter still, as creators seek untouched corners of the market, their target audiences can be more varied. Wish to build a cozy castle diorama? Want a hardcore SWAT simulator or an anime Stardew Valley-like? Crave an ode to Brazilian bootleg boomer shooters of the 1990s built on actual 1990s tech? If you have an itch, odds are it can be scratched.\n\nAnd yet, a diminutive portion of the overall gaming audience plays new games. According to a report from Newzoo, in 2023 players spent 77% of their playtime on games three years or older. Much of the time players spent on new games went to annualized franchises, like Call of Duty, Madden, and EA FC. A paltry 8% of overall playtime in 2023 went to new games not tied to big, yearly IP.\n\nIn 2024, when someone sits down to play a video game, they can either spend money on a promising but unknown new game, or they can choose from their massive backlog of owned games. Or, they might return to a live-service game like League of Legends or Fortnite that continues to provide a familiar dopamine surge week after week, year after year. To play a new game is to willingly take a risk in terms of one\u2019s money, time, and happiness.\n\nThus, we have 8% of total playtime going toward new games: a tiny slice of pie from which the thousands of developers each year fight for a bite. Ryan Rigney, gaming comms veteran and author of the illuminating Push to Talk newsletter, has been digging into this problem (and this unsettling data) for the past few weeks. I strongly recommend you read his piece \u201cAre Old Games Killing New Games?\u201d\n\nIn that newsletter, Rigney uses Arco, his personal favorite game of the year, which at the time of writing this piece has a modest 623 reviews on Steam, as an example of how a truly great game can fall through the cracks. The example hit me like a rock to the forehead. Despite Arco being one of my most anticipated games, despite receiving advance code from a publicist, despite having a weekly video game podcast that requires me to sample dozens of new games a year, I only now have gotten around to playing this game.\n\nAnd frankly, even with everything going for it, Arco could have just as easily collected dust indefinitely on my exponentially elongating to-do list.\n\nHow to enjoy new video games in the Age of Abundance\n\nSlackers - Carts of Glory is one of the many great games of 2024 that you\u2019ve likely never played. Image: Falling Saints\n\nWhat does this mean for you? As the headline promised (or threatened?), you too won\u2019t play many of 2024\u2019s best games. Time is against you. The number of hours can\u2019t fit the surplus of great new releases.\n\nAssuming we all accept that to be true, I thought it might help if I shared some strategies I\u2019ve learned over the years for making the most of my video game time. As someone professionally expected to have a grasp on the vast majority of video games released, plus the entirety of gaming history, I\u2019ve been wrestling with this challenge for some time.\n\nBe mindful of where your gaming time goes: This is my number one tip when people ask me how I play so many games. The answer is that I play the stuff I like, and I skip or bail on the stuff I don\u2019t. For the past decade, major video game publishers have worked tirelessly to create \u201cforever\u201d games that use habit-forming hooks to lock in players indefinitely. If you want to play the same game every day for years on end, that\u2019s fine and your prerogative! Alternatively, if you want to play new games more, then take a break from your \u201cforever\u201d game of choice. You might find, with some distance, it had become a chore rather than a treat.\n\nWatch streams and playthroughs: Ashley Bardhan recently argued that watching a video game isn\u2019t so different from playing it. I agree. This guidance won\u2019t surprise anyone under the age of 30. But many gamers in the millennial demographic (or older) have yet to make a habit of watching streams on Twitch or playthroughs on YouTube. If this is your first time, search for a playthrough of a new game that interests you on YouTube, skim the headlines and thumbnail images for a style that matches your own, and give it a try!\n\nFind communities that match your pace: Similar to watching games, reading about games is a great way to follow games. Just be sure to find a community that moves at your tempo. If you want a trillion messages and the latest info, a game\u2019s official or unofficial Discord can be great. Want the highlights, try a subreddit. And if you prefer to keep up to date on the games community as a whole, rather than one game, I recommend Polygon.com. Naturally.\n\nAccept that you can\u2019t know everything: For the first few decades of video game culture, the most hardcore gamers took pride in having an encyclopedic knowledge of the industry. Not only had they played every game, but they also knew its developer, publisher, and \u2014 if it came from Japan \u2014 the original title and release date. Because game developers of the \u201980s and \u201990s only released so many games, exhaustive knowledge could be cultivated. The NES had 1,377 games. But then the PS4 had 3,399 games. Steam laps both those numbers each year. In 2024, acquiring an all-encompassing knowledge of video games isn\u2019t possible. And the pursuit of it is like trying to catch every fish in the ocean.\n\nImage: Mossmouth via Polygon\n\nBefore I wrap, let\u2019s talk about one more game.\n\nLast month, developer Mossmouth published what Game File author Stephen Totilo wrote \u201cmight be the most 2024 game anyone can play this year.\u201d If you can even call it a game. UFO 50 is a package carrying 50 stand-alone, complete games from some of the most brilliant game designers alive.\n\nUFO 50\u2019s a masterpiece and the vast majority of gamers will never play it. A tiny fraction of those who do will manage to play all 50 games. And an infinitesimal percentage of the people on Earth will finish the game in its entirety.\n\nThe project is a microcosm of the problem that faces players. With so many good games in UFO 50, its players must approach the game as they would the entire video game ecosystem. Be mindful of your time and your priorities. Dabble! Don\u2019t like a game? Drop it! Be comfortable knowing you don\u2019t have to play all 50 games to completion to enjoy UFO 50. In fact, you don\u2019t have to play any of them.\n\nWeeks after its release, fans have come together to solve its mysteries and celebrate their favorite games within the game on Reddit, Twitch, and YouTube. They\u2019ve created lore explainers, role-played within its fictional history, and carried the experience of the game beyond the confines of the software."

        "article_content": "Google promised its Gemini AI wouldn\u2019t be a mere chatbot replacement for Google Assistant. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll see if that pledge holds up. Gemini extensions will allow the AI to access users more Google apps rather than just Gmail or YouTube. If it works as intended, it could be the first true cross-phone AI integration.\n\nIn a blog post, Google offered a rough time frame for when we\u2019ll be able to integrate Gemini with different Workspace apps like Google Keep, Google Calendar, Tasks, and Utilities. Currently, Gemini can work with Gmail, Maps, and YouTube. The general concept is that, at users\u2019 request, the AI will be able to pull information from one app to the other without users needing to scroll to find the information they\u2019re looking for.\n\nAs an example, the Mountain View tech giant said users should be able to pull a recipe from Gmail and then add the ingredients into a note in Keep. It will also work with your phone\u2019s camera, and if users take a photo of a receipt or concert ticket, you should be able to set it as an event or reminder in Calendar.\n\nThese features should be dropping in the next few weeks, so we shouldn\u2019t have to wait too long before we try Google\u2019s Geminification of our phones for ourselves. The Gemini app has already taken over most of Assistant\u2019s former duties, and earlier this week, Google gave every Android phone access to Gemini Live. This feature lets you have a conversation with your phone in a more natural way than the base Gemini, which still works better with short and sweet commands.\n\nGoogle showcased some of these features at its big August showcase, revealing the new Pixel 9 series alongside new watches and Pixel Buds. Apple has promised very similar capabilities with its still-incoming Apple Intelligence. So far, we haven\u2019t had the chance to test either company\u2019s full mobile AI integrations. The idea seems sound, but knowing how finicky and inconsistent AI can be, we\u2019re not exactly holding our breath for a real mobile ecosystem sea change.\n\nI may have far less use for a conversational AI than I would for an assistant who can uproot the important emails from my flooded inbox. On Wednesday, Google said it was updating Gmail\u2019s \u201csummary cards\u201d and \u201cHappening soon\u201d features. Happening soon should show the most timely updates, such as deliveries or events happening, based on your emails.\n\nSummary cards now show more information right at the top of each email for purchases, events, bills, and travel registrations. You can add events to your calendar, just like before. But now you can also modify your bookings or get directions to an airport or venue.\n\nGoogle said Gemini was getting access to more than 40 languages other than English, eventually. First on the list are French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, and Hindi. The rest will come sometime in the future. Each phone\u2019s Gemini Live can support conversations with up to two languages at a time. Now even more people will be able to see their Android phone transform into an AI device. The cross-platform mobile AI does feel enticing, especially for those of us with too many things going on to remember where the hell you put that one email with the event registration. However, for those who prefer their phones to be AI-free and still get new features, you may need to bite the Gemini bullet."

        "article_content": "\u00d7\n\nMilford to hold talks, signings in Durango and Farmington\n\nRetired Navajo Ranger Stanley Milford Jr. has seen some things in his life that can\u2019t always be explained.\n\n\u00d7\n\nMilford, who split his time growing up between his mother\u2019s house in Oklahoma and with his father on the Navajo Reservation, said not only was his upbringing between two different geographic areas, the two were culturally different as well: Oklahoma was more \u201cmainstream and Western\u201d while the reservation was steeped in \u201cNative American culture.\u201d\n\nWhen he grew up, he graduated from the United States Indian Police Academy and became a Navajo Ranger, where he and his partner, Jonathan Dover, investigated paranormal cases called in by residents. For those who have been in the area a while, he also cut his teeth in law enforcement by helping during the 1998 Four Corners manhunt for the three men \u2013 Jason McVean, Robert Mason and Alan \u201cMonte\u201d Pilon \u2013 who killed Cortez Police Officer Dale Claxton and took off into the Colorado/Utah desert.\n\nHe\u2019s just released his memoir, \u201cThe Paranormal Ranger,\u201d and will be at Maria\u2019s Bookshop and in Farmington to discuss it. He\u2019s also been featured on shows, including Nexflix\u2019s reboot of \u201cUnsolved Mysteries.\u201d\n\nIf you go WHAT: Author Event and Book-Signing With Stanley Milford Jr. and his new release, \u201cThe Paranormal Ranger.\u201d WHEN: 6-8 p.m. Oct. 10. WHERE: Maria\u2019s Bookshop, 960 Main Ave. MORE INFORMATION: Visit https://tinyurl.com/y67bn8sx.\n\nThe memoir is a mix of Milford\u2019s autobiography interspersed with chapters about the Navajo origin story.\n\nMilford and Dover first got into paranormal investigations when they were called to take over the case of a Navajo grandmother, who lost a sheep.\n\n\u201cShe recounted this story of this Bigfoot stepping over into her sheep corral and taking off with one of her sheep,\u201d he said. \u201cShe called the department, and two Rangers were assigned, and one of the Rangers was a comedian; he\u2019s just constantly joking and laughing and carrying on. It\u2019s just his personality, but I think the grandmother was probably offended by that, and she contacted the chief ranger and probably chewed him out.\u201d\n\nBecause of her call, the chief called a department meeting, and told everyone that no matter how strange a case may seem, it\u2019s real to the person making the call, and every case was to be investigated as such, even if responding officers didn\u2019t believe it. And then, Milford said, the chief looked over at him and Dover and said they were going to oversee these cases and manage them.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s how it happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as us being assigned to it, we weren\u2019t sitting over there raising our hands to be the Navajo \u2018X Files\u2019 or whatever. That wasn\u2019t the case. We were assigned to do it, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nMilford said the idea to include the origin story into his memoir was inspired by a case in 2009 of a haunting he investigated in Window Rock, Arizona.\n\n\u201cIt was an office space, and the director had said \u2018my staff are experiencing all kinds of what they\u2019re describing as paranormal phenomena.\u2019 She approached the chief ranger at the time and asked if he had anybody that could come in and validate any of the stuff that they were claiming,\u201d he said. \u201cI put together a team of four individuals. We went in on two nights, and one of the prominent things about that case was coins would materialize and fall out of nothingness, out of thin air.\u201d\n\nAnd even after all this time, he said the coins appearing followed him: \u201cLast month, I had the most coins that I\u2019ve ever experienced ... this phenomenon still happens to me to this very day. Witnessing that with your own eyes, it really changes your worldview.\n\n\u201cIt made me realize that, like with the Navajo, in their creation story, they talk about this idea of coming through these different worlds into the physical world that we\u2019re in right now. Some of them describe either four worlds or five worlds, depending on the version of it. It got me thinking that, like with these coins, these coins are manifesting in our physical world from somewhere else. It got me to thinking about string theory and the idea of other planes of existence or dimensions.\u201d\n\nMilford said he starting thinking even further about different paranormal phenomenon that people refer to, \u201clike Bigfoot and UFOs and extraterrestrials, even the witchcraft, even the skinwalkers and things like that. I think they use the these other dimensions coming and going into our physical world from these other dimensions. That\u2019s how we experience it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn and I lived in the woods at times, being Navajo Rangers right in the heavily forested high mountain areas, and we did not find the evidence that supports these things live out there,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou can find all of that with bears, mountain lions, cougars, coyotes and everything that lives out there. You can see where it beds down. You can see where it goes out and hunts and drinks. You can find all of that evidence of that ... but the thing with the Bigfoot, you don\u2019t see all of that evidence, although twice I\u2019ve witnessed this thing that people refer to as Bigfoot. And so I know that these things do happen, and they do exist. So it could interdimensional.\u201d\n\nAnd while he\u2019s had his share of people who don\u2019t believe in what he\u2019s seen and believes, Milford said the key is to be open-minded.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always going to have people that are going to take the opposite 180 view from what you\u2019re talking about, and I understand that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the message that John and I are conveying out there is much more important than listening to those people that are going to put it down. And John and I are open minded; we were very open minded. I remember one time we presented in Dulce, New Mexico, at one other UFO thing. There was an elderly Native woman that came up to us. She was in her mid 80s, and she came up to us with tears in her eyes and hugged us after we did our presentation. She said, \u2018Thank you for doing what you do.\u2019 She went on to convey a story about when she was a young girl encountering her UFO and her family members are standing around her with their jaws wide open because she never, ever shared that experience with them. I think, out of fear of being ridiculed or shunned, or whatever it might be, she never shared that experience. She thanked us and she said, you\u2019re giving people that have these experiences more or less a forum to be able to come together and share these experiences with like-minded people that are willing to listen.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s really, ultimately what the book is: to let people know that these experiences do happen, and to be respectful of others that do have these experiences, and letting people know these people aren\u2019t crazy, and they\u2019re not alone. And I would dare to say worldwide, if you looked at every family on this planet, if you looked in the history of their family, there\u2019s probably somebody within that family that has had some type of so-called supernatural or paranormal experience, whether it\u2019s seeing UFOs and lights in the sky or hauntings. I think it\u2019s much more common than we could ever imagine.\u201d\n\nkatie@durangoherald.com"

Some would eventually make their way online, and even pop up in the odd screening, including versions when Katie slit her own throat and was killed by the cops. But one that didn't actually make it in front of the camera seems like the most fascinating of the lot.\n\nThe same new camera used to capture so much of the titular activity Micah purchased at the very beginning of the film would have been used to murder him in the end. Katie was set to bludgeon him to death with it, meaning viewers would have seen that death through the POV of the camera. How cool.\n\nCool, but quite difficult to pull off, which is why it was never shot. But still, there's a chance that sort of creative end would have been just as, if not more memorable than Katie roaring the film to a close."

The vast majority of yachts rely on dirty energy for power and to supply the massive amounts of electricity they consume. Some superyachts, The Guardian reported, emit more planet-overheating air pollution per year by themselves than many small countries.\n\nSocial scientist Gregory Salle labeled superyachts a form of \"ecocide\" in his book, Superyachts: Luxury, Tranquility and Ecocide. Superyachts, Salle wrote, display, \"the capacity of the wealthiest individuals to exonerate themselves from the social and environmental cost of their activities and behaviours.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that the yacht that took Maroni to Svalbard was not a superyacht but a regular yacht, meaning that it merely creates a large amount of planet-overheating air pollution instead of a mind-boggling amount of planet-overheating air pollution.\n\nThe positive to take away from the story is that more ocean research can be used to better protect our oceans \u2014 largely from the threats caused by the very pollution that yachts create every day.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

The marine robotics company\u2019s trio of orange, 20-foot-long underwater robots found the historic vessel while mapping what is now the 1,286-square-mile Cordell Bank national marine sanctuary off the California coast. Also known as the \u201cGhost Ship of the Pacific,\u201d the 314-foot-long ship has spent the past 78 years resting roughly 3,500 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface, and appears to remain almost completely intact and upright.\n\nThe USS Stewart shipwreck as seen in a 3D map of the region. Credit: Ocean Infinity\n\n\u201cThis level of preservation is exceptional for a vessel of its age and makes it potentially one of the best-preserved examples of a US Navy \u2018four-piper\u2019 destroyer known to exist,\u201d Maria Brown, superintendent for both Cordell Bank and Greater Farallones national marine sanctuaries, said in a statement to The New York Times on October 1.\n\nThe USS Stewart\u2019s story is unique in US maritime history, making it one of the most sought-after wrecks for decades. Initially sunk and abandoned after sustaining substantial battle damage, Japanese forces managed to raise the destroyer, repair it, and reenlist it against America as a naval convoy escort. During its second life, Allied pilots began recounting what appeared to be one of their own ships far within enemy territory, earning the Stewart its \u201cGhost Ship\u201d moniker.\n\nThe shipwreck now serves as a home to deep sea ocean life like crabs and fish. Credit: Ocean Infinity\n\nThe US Navy recovered the Stewart following Japan\u2019s surrender and intended to tow it back to its original home. While en route, however, its engines gave out near Guam, forcing the fleet to tow it the rest of its journey. Once back in the US, the \u201cGhost Ship of the Pacific\u201d was given a dramatic burial at sea on May 24, 1946: Used as target practice for naval forces, it still took an estimated 2 hours of fire to finally sink it for good. But in the years since, the exact coordinates of its location were lost.\n\nThe USS Stewart, seen sinking during its final scuttling by the US Navy. Credit: US Navy / Ocean Infinity\n\nNumerous attempts were made in the past to find the USS Stewart, but the successful August search reportedly came about almost by accident. Ocean Infinity, which previously used its drones to help rediscover the USS Nevada and Endurance wrecks, originally wanted to simply test out multiple of its largest autonomous underwater robots simultaneously. That\u2019s when Russ Matthews, president of the Air/Sea Heritage Foundation nonprofit, suggested the drones be used to scan for the Ghost Ship after he found coordinates of the tugboat that pulled it out to the area of its final scuttling. While it usually takes weeks to map out 37-square-nautical-miles of ocean floor, the drones managed to find the Stewart in a few hours.\n\n[Related: The famous railing from \u2018Titanic\u2019 has broken off from Titanic.]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of, I think, a radical change in ocean discovery,\u201d Jim Delgado, senior vice president of SEARCH, Inc, a maritime archeology firm also involved in the project, told The New York Times on Tuesday.\n\nAside from long-lost shipwrecks, autonomous mapping drones can be used to identify promising ocean floor space for the construction of wind farms, as well as chart routes for underwater cabling."

Desktop users must scan the QR code to download the app. Fill out the required registration fields. If you use the link we provide, a promo code is not needed. Confirm that you agree to the terms and conditions. Select a banking method and make your first deposit.

Receive $1,000 in bonus bets if you maximize the offer.\n\nBuccaneers vs Falcons odds to use your Fanatics promo code on\n\nFanatics Sportsbook favors the Falcons as 1.5-point favorites for the game and have a moneyline set at -125. If you think Tampa Bay can pull off the upset, their moneyline is +105. The over-under on the game is at 43.5 points with -110 odds in either direction.\n\nWhen evaluating player props for tonight\u2019s games, the line I like the most is Chris Godwin to outproduce his current yardage line of 65.5 (-110).\n\nGodwin is the team\u2019s clear top target, and should be prioritized in a short week.He\u2019s surpassed this mark in 3 of his past 4 outings.\n\nAdditionally, the Falcons have been picked on by the opposing team\u2019s top wideout week in, and week out. The lowest they\u2019ve allowed through the first two weeks is 76 yards to DeVonta Smith in Week 2. That trend should continue with a big game from Godwin on Thursday night."
