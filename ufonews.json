        "article_content": "Watch live! Pentagon UFO office testifies to Senate emerging threats committee - YouTube Watch On\n\nA U.S. Senate subcommittee will hear from the Pentagon's UFO office tomorrow, and you can watch live.\n\nDirector Jon T. Kosloski of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, will testify before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities on Tuesday (Nov. 19) starting at 4:30 p.m. ET (2130 GMT). A closed-door session off-limits to the public will be held prior to the open session, beginning at 3:15 p.m. ET (2015 GMT).\n\nYou can watch the hearing live at Space.com, courtesy of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nAARO's logo in front of the Pentagon. AARO's Latin motto translates roughly as \"the universe is changing/our life is what our thoughts make of it.\" (Image credit: AARO/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Department of Defense created AARO in July 2022 in order to serve as a \"focal point for all UAP and UAP-related activities and may represent the Department for such activities,\" the Pentagon said at the time, in a statement.\n\nAARO has already released its 2024 report, which covers sightings of UFOs (or UAP, as they're now known) between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024 as well as \"all UAP reports from any previous time periods that were not included in an earlier report.\"\n\nThe document states that AARO received 757 total case reports during the period, 485 of which fell within the reporting timeframe. Of these cases, 118 were solved and another 174 are slated for closure pending a final review.\n\nStill, many cases remain unsolved, and AARO continues to study them. However, the report notes that \"AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology.\"\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe office's previous report, released in January 2023, came to similar conclusions.\n\nAARO also concluded in the report that it has \"no indication or confirmation\" that UFO reports are \"attributable to foreign adversaries.\"\n\nAARO's latest findings might not sit well with some in the UFO/UAP community.\n\nThat's because, just last week, a quartet of high-profile witnesses \u2014 including a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral, a former NASA associate administrator and a former U.S. counterintelligence officer \u2014 told the U.S. House of Representatives that a wide-ranging and long-running government conspiracy has, for decades, served to \"hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos\" from the American public.\n\nWe are \"in the midst of a multi-decade, secretive arms race \u2014 one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies,\" one of the witnesses stated during the hearing.\n\nAARO was specifically named as being complicit in the cover-up during this hearing. \"AARO is unable, or perhaps unwilling, to bring forward the truth about the government's activities concerning UAPs,\" Representative Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) said during the hearing's opening remarks. \"I'm disturbed that AARO itself lacks transparency; even its budget is kept from the public. So if there is no 'there' there, then why are we spending money on it? And by how much? Why the secrecy?\""

        "article_content": "Advertisement\n\nTwinMind, founded by former Google X employees, is building an AI assistant to better understand you.\n\nThe founders believe memory is key and something that rival products like OpenAI's ChatGPT lack.\n\nThe startup said it has raised over $2.5 million and was most recently valued at $30 million.\n\nA startup formed by a handful of former Googlers \u2014 specifically Google X, the skunkworks lab that explores sci-fi moonshot ideas \u2014 is coming out of stealth.\n\nNamed TwinMind, its app would function as an AI assistant that lives in your smartphone and always listens. Its founders like to compare it to Jarvis, the AI designed by Marvel's Tony Stark: It's constantly learning what you're doing and talking about and then uses that information to better understand you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwinMind founder and CEO Daniel George said the company raised over $2.5 million this year in two rounds, the latest giving TwinMind a $30 million post-money valuation. Notable investors to date include Oracle's chief AI scientist, Dan Roth; a Rocketship VC founding partner, Anand Rajaraman; and Michael Liou, an early investor in Robinhood and Zapier.\n\nTwinMind is emerging into a competitive market filled with chatbots galore. George told Business Insider he believes the idea of an AI assistant that learns and retains information about users could help set TwinMind apart.\n\nWhile other AI assistants and chatbots, such as Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, are improving at memory, they're still not very good at it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you had your own Jarvis, why would you Google? Why would you ask ChatGPT?\" George told BI. \"None of these other tools capture you. None of them understand you. They don't understand what's happening in your life.\"\n\nTwinMind would run in the background of your phone, store audio in the short term, and transcribe it to text, which would go into TwinMind's memory bank. Then, users could open the app and see a readout of their day broken down into key moments.\n\nYou could also ask it questions. Because TwinMind is learning about you, what you've done, and the people you've spent your day with, it aims to pull all that information in, allowing you to talk to TwinMind in a way that feels more natural and without having to add heaps of context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup is also rolling out a web browser extension, which (with permission) could see what users are browsing online and capture it in memory. By integrating calendars and Gmail, users could also ask TwinMind to draft emails. That's something you can already do with other chatbots, of course, but TwinMind's edge here would be drawing on all that memory it holds of the user, George said.\n\n\"You just go in there and, say, write your marketing email. And it knows everything about me, who my cofounders are, what my company is, what we have done before,\" said George. \"Imagine Grammarly, but instead of correcting grammar, it actually writes it based on all the memories and context.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nWolverine origins\n\nAt Google X, George was the first machine-learning scientist working on Wolverine, a hearing-wearable project first reported on by Business Insider in 2021. That project has since spun out into a startup named Iyo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched in late 2022, George was working at JPMorgan with TwinMind cofounder and chief technology officer Sunny Tang, a Google X alum.\n\nHe said the two watched as colleagues started using AI chatbots in meetings. The pair hacked together a crude chatbot of their own that could transcribe meetings and answer questions about what was being said. The idea evolved into the startup ThirdEar, but they changed the name to TwinMind because someone else owned the ThirdEar domain name. George said the team also felt the name didn't reflect the visual elements they were building, such as the Chrome extension.\n\nTwinMind does most of its processing locally on the phone but could connect to the cloud if it needed to answer a question or if the user wanted an improved AI experience, George said. TwinMind plans to offer a free app version with a $20-a-month tier for users who want access to more advanced large language models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, it raises some questions about privacy. George said that because TwinMind does not capture images and only transcribes the audio, it falls under the same category of assistants as Siri or Alexa.\n\nPerhaps the more impressive feat here will be on the hardware side.\n\n\"The main innovation is figuring out how to get this thing running all day, in your pocket, without draining your battery, [and with] all the Apple walled garden stuff,\" George said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the team figured it out, and the TwinMind app could run for 12 hours nonstop in the background before running out the battery.\n\nThe team has just opened its seed round, and George said they're looking to raise at least $5 million. The company is also telling potential investors about its future plans, which include making the switch between phone and desktop more seamless so that TwinMind feels more embedded in users' lives.\n\nGeorge said more than 2,000 early testers have already provided feedback, and the team plans to launch the app this week on Product Hunt. It will be available first on the iPhone and as a Chrome extension, with Android and Mac apps to follow next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are sure that in a couple of years, everyone is going to have a personalized AI companion that knows their whole life and has access to all of the world's knowledge on the internet,\" George told BI. \"And that would be the way people access information. Not through Google.\""

        "source": "Her Campus",
        "article_content": "This article is written by a student writer from the Her Campus at UC Irvine chapter.\n\nSpooky season is over, but this conversation is just beginning. Why is it that movies like the Smile series, overdone with graphic gore scenes and predictable jump scares, just don\u2019t invoke the same fear as films more simply recorded on a mobile device? Allow me to explain.\n\n1) I don\u2019t relate to you.\n\nOutrageous plot lines, such as the drug-ridden pop-star protagonist in Smile 2, force the viewer to deviate from the narrative. In stark contrast, the six main characters featured in the Skype-call-turned-scary movie Unfriended, encounter issues regarding bullying, suicide, social hierarchy, and infidelity. Despite the running time of Smile 2 dwarfing that of Unfriended, I learned and empathized more with each of the six characters than I did with the one.\n\n2) What else is coming?\n\nOnce you see it, you can\u2019t unsee it. Something or someone in the corner\u2014it was probably just nothing. Or was it? We mustn\u2019t underestimate the value of gradual jump scares, discrete to disastrous. No franchise executes this concept better than Paranormal Activity. With an almost voyeuristic quality, the discrete introduction of jump scares excels at keeping momentum and engineering the fright to feel like it is happening right next to the viewer. This creeping terror, amplified by the homemade style of mobile-recording footage, keeps the viewer on edge, not knowing exactly when or where the next scare will come, dreading this continuous and uncomfortable experience. What begins as a minor inconvenience, a lamp knocked over, a dog barking too loud, quickly snowballs into your worst nightmare: chandelier collapses on the floor, total demonic possession, and more!\n\nThis kind of unpredictable jump-scare will forever surpass the jarring rather than genuinely unsettling attempt of films like the Smile series. Designed to deliver an adrenaline rush, the coupled abruptness forces me to undermine the build-up of suspense. It feels more mechanical and about delivering a reaction than creating a lingering sense of dread.\n\n3) We\u2019re all just one big happy family!\n\nThere\u2019s one subconscious thing we don\u2019t notice, but it completely alters how we absorb that 90-minute fear fest. That thing is the focus on a small, consistent group of characters\u2014typically a couple or a family\u2014creating intimacy and isolation. Best executed in the Paranormal Activity franchise, this intensifies the horror because, unlike in films with rotating characters, the viewer can\u2019t escape the anxiety or unease growing in the house or apartment. Stakes skyrocket because the emotional bond with the characters grows over time; we feel their distress as if we\u2019re a part of their big happy family. Viewers don\u2019t just see a sequence of scary events\u2014they live through the psychological unraveling of the family, making it more personal.\n\nConversely, Smile shifts the focus to new characters and various settings more frequently, diluting the emotional investment. Constantly introducing new faces makes it harder for the viewer to form that lasting emotional connection. Because these characters are fleeting, the sense of isolation and shared experience with them isn\u2019t as strong. You\u2019re often left with a sense that you\u2019re simply passing through the lives of the people being targeted, rather than witnessing a gradual unraveling of their lives. As a result, the horror feels less intimate and more external\u2014it\u2019s a spectacle, but one that we\u2019re not truly living through alongside the characters.\n\nAbove all, there is a definite need for an increased release of films with a structure similar to Unfriended and Paranormal Activity. I demand more of this raw, unpolished feel, and this authenticity that comes with it. The shakiness, the low-quality visuals, and the sense of witnessing something secret resonates so deeply today that the line between reality and fiction continues to blur. The least you could do is take a look and tap into the unknown and the unexplainable."

        "article_content": "Ian Holloway has promised to \u201ccleanse\u201d Swindon \u2019s \u201chaunted\u201d training ground as he desperately tries to win a game.\n\nThe former Blackpool and Queens Park Rangers boss was appointed as the club\u2019s new manager last month as he replaced Mark Kennedy. But it has not quite gone to plan so far.\n\nHolloway has yet to win a league game as Swindon manager - leaving the side sitting 22nd in League Two. Their latest outing saw them draw 2-2 with Accrington Stanley.\n\nSwindon have also been beset with misfortune on the injury front, with captain Ollie Clarke becoming the latest to pick up an issue as he ruptured a tendon in his ankle during training. And Holloway believes that paranormal activity could have something to do with the situation that the club find themselves in.\n\nSpeaking with BBC Radio Wiltshire, he said: \"I'm absolutely devastated so I'm going to try and cleanse the training ground area because people are telling me it's haunted. There's a graveyard somewhere near. Honestly, I'm not joking.\n\n\"I think our training ground is very close to an ancient burial site so I'm going to get my wife to come up and say sorry to all these people and hopefully we'll have a bit more luck.\"\n\nAnd while Holloway is aiming to find a resolution to the ghostly goings-on, he has stopped short of following Barry Fry \u2019s example. The former Birmingham boss allegedly had a wee in all four corners of the St Andrews\u2019 pitch in an effort to lift an apparent curse put on the club.\n\n\"I don't want to do what he did, I think he had to urinate on the corners of his pitch but I'm going to get my wife to come up with her sage,\" Holloway added.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nWhat's the strangest reason you've ever heard for a defeat? Share your thoughts in the comments below\n\n\"I've done the Glastonbury stuff and the hail and welcome - great if you believe it. Do I? Really I'm not sure but I'm going to get it just to help because there's some strange things happening.\"\n\nSwindon have an excellent chance to earn their first victory of the Holloway era this weekend. They take on bottom of the table Morecambe at home on Saturday afternoon.\n\nA win could potentially see Holloway\u2019s side move four points clear of the relegation zone. But a defeat could see them slump to the bottom of the table.\n\nThe side have been in League Two since their relegation at the end of the 2020/21 campaign. The highest they have finished since then has been sixth the following campaign. Swindon finished 19th last term - nine points clear of relegation. The club has never dropped out of the Football League in their history.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Covered in thick, dark brown fur about an inch long, the cub's soft coat has surprised researchers. Alexey V. Lopatin, the lead researcher and director of the Borissiak Paleontological Institute in Moscow, expressed his awe, saying it was incredible to see the physical appearance of such a long-extinct creature, especially one as fascinating as the sabre-toothed cat.\n\nA rare mummy cat discovered\n\nA mummified Ice Age cub from Siberia has stunned scientists as the first known mummy of a sabre-toothed cat, sparking excitement in the paleontological world.\n\nThis discovery marks the first evidence of the sabre-toothed species Homotherium latidens in Asia, though fossils have been found in places like the Netherlands and Canada. While the Siberian region has given us many ice age mummies, including woolly rhinos and mammoths, mummified sabre-toothed cats are extremely rare. Prior to this find, only two other cat mummies, both cave lion cubs, were known.\n\nThe cub was discovered in 2020 by Yakutian diggers searching for mammoth tusks near the Badyarikha River in Siberia. Radiocarbon dating revealed that the cub lived at least 35,000 years ago, during the later part of the Pleistocene epoch. Paleontologists are now focused on extracting DNA from the mummy to learn even more about this species.\n\nPaleontologist Jack Tseng, who was not involved in the discovery, was left \"at a loss for words\" by the find. The discovery of soft tissue from this ancient lineage is incredibly rare, and Tseng believes this could change our understanding of prehistoric life. With detailed studies of the mummy's skeleton, muscles, and fur on the horizon, scientists are eager to uncover more secrets of this ancient predator."

        "article_content": "The landscape of wealth creation continues to evolve, with several under-the-radar trends creating significant opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors. While mainstream attention often focuses on established sectors, these quiet disruptors are generating substantial returns for those who recognize their potential early.\n\nThe micro-SaaS revolution\n\nA new generation of software entrepreneurs is finding success through highly targeted solutions. Unlike traditional software companies targeting broad markets, micro-SaaS businesses focus on specific niches with particular needs. These lean operations, often run by small teams, create specialized tools for distinct market segments.\n\nThe success of this model lies in its efficiency. Low overhead costs combined with subscription-based revenue streams generate steady profits. These businesses thrive by solving precise problems for specific industries, from specialized project management tools to niche financial software solutions.\n\nSustainable niche markets\n\nEnvironmental consciousness has moved beyond mainstream products into specialized sectors. Entrepreneurs are discovering profitable opportunities in developing sustainable solutions for specific industries. This trend encompasses everything from eco-friendly packaging for e-commerce to specialized green cleaning products for commercial sectors.\n\nThese targeted environmental solutions command premium prices while building strong brand loyalty. The combination of sustainability and specialization creates higher profit margins than traditional green products, particularly as businesses face increasing pressure to reduce their environmental impact.\n\nDigital-first food services\n\nGhost kitchens and virtual restaurants continue transforming the food industry landscape. These digital-first operations eliminate traditional restaurant overhead while maximizing delivery service potential. Entrepreneurs run multiple virtual brands from single locations, diversifying revenue streams without proportional cost increases.\n\nThis model proves particularly profitable in urban areas with high delivery demand. The reduced initial investment and operational costs allow for quick profitability, while the flexibility to adjust menus and brands based on market demand provides a significant competitive advantage.\n\nPersonalized health technology\n\nHealth tech is evolving beyond generic wellness advice to offer truly personalized solutions. Entrepreneurs are developing platforms that combine wearable technology, data analytics, and artificial intelligence to deliver customized health recommendations and monitoring.\n\nThese services typically generate recurring revenue through subscription models while maintaining high customer retention rates. The focus on preventative health and personalized care aligns with growing consumer demand for proactive health management solutions.\n\nAI-enhanced content creation\n\nArtificial intelligence is revolutionizing content production and distribution. New platforms enable small teams to generate and manage large volumes of targeted content efficiently. This technological leverage allows entrepreneurs to build significant online presence with minimal staff.\n\nThe trend extends beyond basic content generation to include:\n\nAutomated social media management\n\nPersonalized marketing campaigns\n\nDynamic website content\n\nCustomized user experiences\n\nEducational entertainment platforms\n\nThe convergence of education and entertainment creates new opportunities for content monetization. Successful entrepreneurs in this space develop engaging learning experiences that maintain entertainment value while delivering practical knowledge.\n\nThese platforms generate revenue through multiple channels:\n\nSubscription access\n\nPremium content\n\nCorporate partnerships\n\nLicensing agreements\n\nRemote work infrastructure\n\nAs distributed work becomes permanent, new opportunities emerge in supporting remote operations. Entrepreneurs are developing solutions that address specific challenges of remote work environments, from virtual office experiences to digital wellness programs.\n\nThese platforms focus on:\n\nTeam collaboration tools\n\nVirtual workspace management\n\nRemote employee engagement\n\nDigital health benefits\n\nLooking forward\n\nThe most successful entrepreneurs in 2025 combine multiple trends to create unique value propositions. Understanding how these silent trends intersect offers opportunities for innovative business models and investment strategies.\n\nKey considerations for capitalizing on these trends include:\n\nFocusing on scalable, automated solutions\n\nPrioritizing recurring revenue models\n\nLeveraging technology for efficiency\n\nAddressing specific market needs\n\nBuilding sustainable competitive advantages\n\nAs these trends continue evolving, early adopters position themselves for significant returns. The key to success lies in recognizing these opportunities early and executing efficiently while maintaining flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nThis story was created using AI technology."

        "article_content": "Google may be working to merge Chrome OS into its Android operating system to strengthen the value proposition of the software for its best Android tablets. While rumors circulate about Google\u2019s Pixel Tablet 2, experts speculate on how the brand can use future devices to compete with Apple\u2019s stronghold in the tablet market with its iPad line.\n\nSources told Android Authority that Google may be closer to unifying its Android and ChromeOS operating systems for the benefit of bridging this gap. Not only would Android gain highlight features from ChromeOS but in the future, some of the best Chromebooks may also run under a reimagined Android OS, that is more attuned for entertainment as well as productivity. The source added this could be a project that takes several years to unfold.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIf the project came to fruition, a blend of Android tablets and Chromebooks running Android could potentially push the software market share in Google\u2019s favor. There is also a Pixel Laptop rumored to be released running an Android operating system.\n\nDespite being a software and services titan in many different arenas, Google has been unable to truly challenge Apple when it comes to tablet market share. Many hardware brands, including Samsung, Amazon, Lenovo, OnePlus, and Xiaomi partner with Google to use the Android operating system on their tablets. Additionally, Google introduced its own Pixel Tablet in 2023. Even so, Apple still dominates the tablet market with a single tablet line, which takes up 55% of the global market share with iOS, 45% of the market goes to Android devices, and 0.11% goes to Linux in October 2024, according to StatCounter.\n\nPixel Tablet 2 rumors suggest the device could be released in 2025, which could make it ineligible for the long-standing project. However, subsequent Pixel Tablet models could potentially be released with the fused Android and ChromeOS system, according to Android Headlines.\n\nThough Google has not shared any official details about plans to merge Chrome OS and Android, the brand did discuss in June, how it would implement parts of Android\u2019s tech stack into ChromeOS. The publication noted that the stack included \u201cAndroid Linux kernel and Android frameworks,\u201d with apps, features, and extensions that could be a part of the project.\n\nAndroid Headlines noted that Google isn\u2019t the only brand that has blended operating systems on a single device. The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid notably works as an Android tablet but morphs into a Windows laptop when connected to a keyboard. Brands including HP and Dell have also previously released similar products to the market."
