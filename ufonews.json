        "article_content": "The Settings app of any smartphone is a nightmare we all have to deal with on a regular basis. I say that as a longtime iPhone user who still dreads going to the Settings app even after the big redesign in iOS 18. The equally important Control Center redesign makes it easier to access some of the key settings you interact with more frequently.\n\nThe same applies to Android, of course. The Settings app has too many menus to remember, so I usually resort to using the built-in search feature.\n\nBut what if AI could help with that? Samsung is reportedly designing an AI feature that might stop you from visiting the Settings app that often. Instead, Galaxy AI might detect your needs and adjust the settings automatically. That\u2019s the kind of useful AI feature we could all use on our smartphones.\n\nAccording to ETNews, Samsung is developing AI software that would customize the phone experience without the user having to open the Settings app. That doesn\u2019t mean the phone will lack a Settings app. After all, not all Galaxy phone buyers want to use Galaxy AI features.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how this new Galaxy AI feature would work. The report says that Samsung plans to improve the \u201cperformance of \u2018touch points\u2019 such as keyboards and cameras to enable the ability to predict what consumers want in advance.\u201d\n\nAs Android Authority points out, Samsung already lets you control some Settings with the Bixby assistant. But the new Galaxy AI feature above would be more sophisticated than that. Adjusting settings on the fly with minimal user interaction would be incredible.\n\nAs someone dying to see AI evolve on smartphones and computers to the point where I can reliably control the devices, apps, and app features via voice or text prompts, I\u2019d love it if the AI could adjust my settings in real time on its own. The AI would simply learn what I like and then adjust the settings without me having to do anything.\n\nBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself here. It\u2019s unclear how this Settings-related feature would work on future Galaxy AI phones, and there\u2019s no release timeline estimate for it either. What\u2019s certain is that Samsung will want to demo new Galaxy AI abilities when the Galaxy S25 series launches in early January. AI will continue to be a big marketing point for all phones, including Samsung handsets."

        "article_content": "While most countries\u2019 lawmakers are still discussing how to put guardrails around artificial intelligence, the European Union is ahead of the pack, having passed a risk-based framework for regulating AI apps earlier this year.\n\nThe law came into force in August, although full details of the pan-EU AI governance regime are still being worked out \u2014 Codes of Practice are in the process of being devised, for example. But, over the coming months and years, the law\u2019s tiered provisions will start to apply on AI app and model makers so the compliance countdown is already live and ticking.\n\nEvaluating whether and how AI models are meeting their legal obligations is the next challenge. Large language models (LLM), and other so-called foundation or general purpose AIs, will underpin most AI apps. So focusing assessment efforts at this layer of the AI stack seem important.\n\nStep forward LatticeFlow AI, a spinout from public research university ETH Zurich, which is focused on AI risk management and compliance.\n\nOn Wednesday, it published what it\u2019s touting as the first technical interpretation of the EU AI Act, meaning it\u2019s sought to map regulatory requirements to technical ones, alongside an open source LLM validation framework that draws on this work \u2014 which it\u2019s calling Compl-AI (\u201ccompl-ai\u201d\u2026 see what they did there!).\n\nThe AI model evaluation initiative \u2014 which they also dub \u201cthe first regulation-oriented LLM benchmarking suite\u201d \u2014 is the result of a long-term collaboration between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Bulgaria\u2019s Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology (INSAIT), per LatticeFlow.\n\nAI model makers can use the Compl-AI site to request an evaluation of their technology\u2019s compliance with the requirements of the EU AI Act.\n\nLatticeFlow has also published model evaluations of several mainstream LLMs, such as different versions/sizes of Meta\u2019s Llama models and OpenAI\u2019s GPT, along with an EU AI Act compliance leaderboard for Big AI.\n\nThe latter ranks the performance of models from the likes of Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral against the law\u2019s requirements \u2014 on a scale of 0 (i.e. no compliance) to 1 (full compliance).\n\nOther evaluations are marked as N/A where there\u2019s a lack of data, or if the model maker doesn\u2019t make the capability available. (NB: At the time of writing there were also some minus scores recorded but we\u2019re told that was down to a bug in the Hugging Face interface.)\n\nLatticeFlow\u2019s framework evaluates LLM responses across 27 benchmarks such as \u201ctoxic completions of benign text,\u201d \u201cprejudiced answers,\u201d \u201cfollowing harmful instructions,\u201d \u201ctruthfulness,\u201d and \u201ccommon sense reasoning\u201d to name a few of the benchmarking categories it\u2019s using for the evaluations. So each model gets a range of scores in each column (or else N/A).\n\nAI compliance a mixed bag\n\nSo how did major LLMs do? There is no overall model score. So performance varies depending on exactly what\u2019s being evaluated \u2014 but there are some notable highs and lows across the various benchmarks.\n\nFor example there\u2019s strong performance for all the models on not following harmful instructions; and relatively strong performance across the board on not producing prejudiced answers \u2014 whereas reasoning and general knowledge scores were a much more mixed bag.\n\nElsewhere, recommendation consistency, which the framework is using as a measure of fairness, was particularly poor for all models \u2014 with none scoring above the halfway mark (and most scoring well below).\n\nOther areas, such as training data suitability and watermark reliability and robustness, appear essentially unevaluated on account of how many results are marked N/A.\n\nLatticeFlow does note there are certain areas where models\u2019 compliance is more challenging to evaluate, such as hot-button issues like copyright and privacy. So it\u2019s not pretending it has all the answers.\n\nIn a paper detailing work on the framework, the scientists involved in the project highlight how most of the smaller models they evaluated (\u2264 13B parameters) \u201cscored poorly on technical robustness and safety.\u201d\n\nThey also found that \u201calmost all examined models struggle to achieve high levels of diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that these shortcomings are primarily due to model providers disproportionally focusing on improving model capabilities, at the expense of other important aspects highlighted by the EU AI Act\u2019s regulatory requirements,\u201d they add, suggesting that as compliance deadlines start to bite LLM makes will be forced to shift their focus onto areas of concern \u2014 \u201cleading to a more balanced development of LLMs.\u201d\n\nGiven no one yet knows exactly what will be required to comply with the EU AI Act, LatticeFlow\u2019s framework is necessarily a work in progress. It is also only one interpretation of how the law\u2019s requirements could be translated into technical outputs that can be benchmarked and compared. But it\u2019s an interesting start on what will need to be an ongoing effort to probe powerful automation technologies and try to steer their developers toward safer utility.\n\n\u201cThe framework is a first step towards a full compliance-centered evaluation of the EU AI Act \u2014 but is designed in a way to be easily updated to move in lock-step as the Act gets updated and the various working groups make progress,\u201d LatticeFlow CEO Petar Tsankov told TechCrunch. \u201cThe EU Commission supports this. We expect the community and industry to continue to develop the framework towards a full and comprehensive AI Act assessment platform.\u201d\n\nSummarizing the main takeaways so far, Tsankov said it\u2019s clear that AI models have \u201cpredominantly been optimized for capabilities rather than compliance.\u201d He also flagged \u201cnotable performance gaps\u201d \u2014 pointing out that some high capability models can be on a par with weaker models when it comes to compliance.\n\nCyberattack resilience (at the model level) and fairness are areas of particular concern, per Tsankov, with many models scoring below 50% for the former area.\n\n\u201cWhile Anthropic and OpenAI have successfully aligned their (closed) models to score against jailbreaks and prompt injections, open source vendors like Mistral have put less emphasis on this,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd with \u201cmost models\u201d performing equally poorly on fairness benchmarks he suggested this should be a priority for future work.\n\nOn the challenges of benchmarking LLM performance in areas like copyright and privacy, Tsankov explained: \u201cFor copyright the challenge is that current benchmarks only check for copyright books. This approach has two major limitations: (i) it does not account for potential copyright violations involving materials other than these specific books, and (ii) it relies on quantifying model memorization, which is notoriously difficult.\n\n\u201cFor privacy the challenge is similar: The benchmark only attempts to determine whether the model has memorized specific personal information.\u201d\n\nLatticeFlow is keen for the free and open source framework to be adopted and improved by the wider AI research community.\n\n\u201cWe invite AI researchers, developers, and regulators to join us in advancing this evolving project,\u201d said professor Martin Vechev of ETH Zurich and founder and scientific director at INSAIT, who is also involved in the work, in a statement. \u201cWe encourage other research groups and practitioners to contribute by refining the AI Act mapping, adding new benchmarks, and expanding this open-source framework.\n\n\u201cThe methodology can also be extended to evaluate AI models against future regulatory acts beyond the EU AI Act, making it a valuable tool for organizations working across different jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

        "article_content": "Presented by SAP\n\nIn the midst of the AI revolution, fake podcasts and chatbots may get the most hype, but the transformative power of AI lies in the heart of the business. It\u2019s in the day-to-day operations where businesses can realize the potential of AI: automating and improving workflows, gaining intelligent insights and driving efficiency.\n\nSAP, the global powerhouse behind many leading enterprise applications and business AI, is one of the pioneers in applying the latest AI technology to the challenges of running an enterprise. They are folding the technology into their stack across all levels including SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, a cloud-based ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) solution that is customizable to meet unique business needs. ERP tools have long allowed business leaders to manage models of their business processes and now they\u2019ll have the option to leverage time-saving assistance from AI.\n\nJoule, SAP\u2019s generative AI copilot, is differentiated by direct integration across SAP\u2019s broad set of business applications. Consider the basic example of a sales manager who oversees customer orders. Since Joule is integrated across SAP\u2019s business applications, the sales manager will be able to use Joule to check inventory status and potential supply chain issues causing a delay and ask Joule to monitor and resolve the issue quickly, improving workflow and customer experience.\n\nAn AI copilot named Joule\n\n\u201cJoule is the copilot throughout SAP\u2019s cloud portfolio, including ERP,\u201d explained Vinay V, cloud ERP solution expert for SAP. \u201cJoule is the front end to the vast amounts of data and rich process information that resides within SAP. Joule will help to uncover and provide those insights for the end users.\u201d\n\nThe potential of Joule can be found throughout SAP\u2019s solutions. A finance team, for instance, can automate fiscal decisions by using the AI to analyze past results, compare projected and actual financial performance, and make actionable recommendations for budget management. Supply chain management teams can ask Joule for smart predictions to optimize inventories and order fulfillment.\n\nThe power of AI is even more apparent when it can reach across disciplines, divisions and silos in organizations and coordinate the response. These cross-disciplinary opportunities may offer the greatest advantages for enterprises because they can unlock synergies that weren\u2019t being tapped before.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing and developing multiple use cases across each of these application areas,\u201d explained V. \u201cThis is where we see there is a huge potential for making an impact and liberating the technology to help, running through these processes much more efficiently. We see this across finance, in supply chain, including manufacturing, delivery management, production-related activities and also in asset management.\u201d\n\nWhile many of these complex opportunities are just beginning to be explored, AI will have obvious applications for the front-line teams that manage customers, both existing and future. SAP wants to marry their deep reservoir of transaction data with the ability of LLMs to add a more human layer to personalized responses. The ability of large language models to work with human languages opens up the possibilities for humans to work more naturally and efficiently with the underlying SAP systems as well.\n\n\u201cWith Joule, the end users, irrespective of their know-how, irrespective of their background or their familiarity with the systems, can use natural language to interact.\u201d said V. \u201cThat\u2019s a significant change in the way that end users will not only be able to interact, but be able to uncover greater insights on what\u2019s happening within the system.\u201d\n\nEmbracing the cloud\n\nIn essence, SAP is driving a foundational change for its customers. While end-user AI applications may be the most visible, SAP is also using generative AI to help customers migrate to the cloud faster. Moving to the cloud can help simplify operations and reduce costs for businesses. At SAP\u2019s annual TechEd event, the company announced a new generative AI functionality to encourage and support customers to speed up this transition.\n\n\u201cCustomers moving their ERP systems from on-premise to the cloud is a significant endeavor. No jokes about that,\u201d explained Pratibha Kumar Sood, vice president of cloud ERP product marketing at SAP. That is why SAP is investing in generative AI capabilities to help customers get proactive guidance and task automation to help them on their journey.\n\nWhile this generative AI capability is still in beta, SAP plans to roll out this feature more broadly in Q1 of 2025 through its RISE with SAP program and has developed a rigorous process to help customers along the path of embracing the cloud \u2014 and any of the AI that\u2019s available there.\n\n\u201cThis is where the RISE with SAP methodology comes in to help with SAP expert support, tools and best-practice guidance\u201d said Sood. \u201cThe methodology is not just theory \u2014 here are the steps and here are the phases \u2014 but it\u2019s SAP providing expert guidance. We will have our architects, our SAP team of advisors to support the RISE customers right from day one.\u201d\n\nSAP is also enhancing tools like SAP Build with generative AI capabilities that allow both developers and business users to create, scalable, secure and stable extensions to their cloud ERP. These capabilities are designed to promote developer productivity with tools for automated code generation and code explanation.\n\nAI is also strengthening the process of data governance in organizations by bringing continuity to their business. \u201cWe\u2019re leveraging AI to flag and quickly summarize the various changes that are made, or that are pending for a particular master data object,\u201d explained V.\n\nIn the end, all of the seemingly magical powers of AI depend entirely on the quality of the data. The enterprises that rely upon SAP have been using it as a stable platform for back-office tasks like recording transactions or tracking inventory. Now they\u2019re able to unlock new answers sealed away in this data to uncover trends and patterns with the complex analytical AI algorithms.\n\nTo learn more, register for SAP\u2019s RISE Into the Future virtual event taking place on October 22, 2024.\n\nsales@venturebeat.com.\n\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they\u2019re always clearly marked.

Saying not everything that happens during the night is paranormal activity.\n\nMonday, Brian visited University Wisconsin Superior where he spoke on his experience being an investigator and being on shows like \u2018Paranormal Caught on Camera\u2019 and \u2018Haunted Collector\u2019.\n\nYou can also find Brian\u2019s work on his YouTube here, and you can read more of his stories in his book Grains of Sand: Tales of a Paranormal Life.\n\nOne of those stories talks about Brian\u2019s demonic experience with the circle of fire at the Grand Midway Hotel. Brian says, \u201cWhen I say off the chart, I mean literally you go down the list: Chris was getting touched, I was hearing things audibly, Lisa Ann was communing directly with spirits\u2026 it was the most poignant encounter I ever had.\u201d"

During a video call last week, I watched him use some viral GitHub code and a single photo to generate a simplistic deepfake of Elon Musk that maps onto his own face. This digital impersonation was to demonstrate how the startup\u2019s new AI detection tool could work. As Ren masqueraded as Musk on our video chat, still frames from the call were actively sent over to Reality Defender\u2019s custom model for analysis, and the company\u2019s widget on the screen alerted me to the fact that I was likely looking at an AI-generated deepfake and not the real Elon.\n\nSure, I never really thought we were on a video call with Musk, and the demonstration was built specifically to make Reality Defender's early-stage tech look impressive, but the problem is entirely genuine. Real-time video deepfakes are a growing threat for governments, businesses, and individuals. Recently, the chairman of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations mistakenly took a video call with someone pretending to be a Ukrainian official. An international engineering company lost millions of dollars earlier in 2024 when one employee was tricked by a deepfake video call. Also, romance scams targeting everyday individuals have employed similar techniques.\n\n\u201cIt's probably only a matter of months before we're going to start seeing an explosion of deepfake video, face-to-face fraud,\u201d says Ben Colman, CEO and cofounder at Reality Defender. When it comes to video calls, especially in high-stakes situations, seeing should not be believing."

The report offers a detailed examination of industry trends and developments shaping the growth of the Loan Servicing Software market. It also provides a comprehensive analysis and forecast of the market future performance.\n\nGlobal Loan Servicing Software Market is valued at approximately USD 3.83 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to grow with a healthy growth rate of more than 12.01% over the forecast period 2024-2032.\n\nRead the Market Summary Here @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw10064\n\nLoan servicing software is a specialized system used by financial institutions to manage and administer loans post-origination. This software handles various tasks, including payment processing, interest calculation, escrow account management, delinquency tracking, and customer communication. The adoption of such software helps lenders maintain accurate loan records, ensure timely payments, and provide efficient customer service, thereby streamlining operations in the financial sector.\n\nThe market\u2019s growth is driven by the increasing demand for streamlined lending operations, escalating adoption of cloud-based solutions, and rising costs associated with credit servicing. Financial institutions are increasingly integrating advanced technologies and software to offer optimized portfolios and enhanced solutions to customers. Cloud-based payment platforms enable quicker payment collection and offer financial institutions the ability to provide fast and efficient services. Additionally, the global trend of adopting new technologies like blockchain, RPA, and AI in the banking sector is shaping the market, as these innovations reduce processing and servicing times.\n\nHowever, the market faces challenges such as competition from open-source loan servicing software. Smaller organizations, such as non-banking financial companies and small lenders, often opt for open-source solutions due to their lower IT budgets, which can impede the growth of paid software solutions.\n\nRequest To Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw10064\n\nDespite this challenge, the growing focus on streamlining business operations in the financial sector is expected to foster the continued development and adoption of advanced loan servicing software.\n\nKey regions considered in the global loan servicing software market study include North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Rest of the World. North America is anticipated to dominate the market growth during the forecast period, driven by the presence of major financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America, which process large loan volumes. These institutions utilize loan servicing software to manage their operations efficiently, enabling them to track banking services, access servicing information, and manage borrower payments. Whereas, the market in Asia Pacific is anticipated to grow at the fastest rate over the forecast period fueled by rapid growth of the lending industry, increasing loan volumes, and the need for efficient loan management.
