            "article_content": "Chasen Cos., a Baltimore development firm that gained steam during the pandemic housing boom, faces new legal trouble after a bank alleged it defaulted on a nearly $14 million loan.\n\nCourt records filed this month show that a company subsidiary, which owns one property on the 500 block of South Broadway and two others behind it on the 500 block of South Regester Street, failed to make payments on a $13.7 million loan from PeoplesBank, a Pennsylvania-based lender that has since merged with Orrstown Bank.\n\nIt\u2019s the third time since September that Chasen Cos. has faced a foreclosure filing over its Baltimore properties, and at least a dozen contractors and vendors also have alleged nonpayment in lawsuits.\n\nRepresentatives for Chasen Cos. did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nTrustees for the bank wrote in legal filings that in addition to stopping payments last year, Chasen Cos. also violated the agreement by halting work on the project. The trustees also referenced the company\u2019s challenges elsewhere, citing \u201cmaterial adverse changes in their financial conditions\u201d as evidenced by the Maryland-based Sandy Spring Bank obtaining judgments against the company.\n\nOrrstown Bank gave Chasen Cos. and its founders, Brandon Chasen and Paul Davis, a deadline of Dec. 13 to begin satisfying their obligations, according to court documents. But Chasen Cos. offered no such relief, the bank trustees allege. To date, the real estate firm owes more than $4.6 million on the loan and is accruing as much as $1,317 a day in interest, the documents say.\n\nThe company owns as many as 2,000 housing units across its portfolio in Baltimore, Virginia and Florida and agreed to strict loan terms that allow the bank to automatically enter judgment in the event of a default. That\u2019s what also led to judgments on the One Calvert Plaza skyscraper in Downtown Baltimore and 1400 Aliceanna St., and banks have moved to foreclose on the buildings.\n\nChasen Cos. said it would build luxury apartments on the empty lots now facing foreclosure. (Julie Bykowicz)\n\nChasen Cos., which has offices in Fells Point and was as recently as a year ago poised to become a dominant landlord in that neighborhood, has stopped working on many of its projects.\n\nThe Baltimore Business Journal reported in late 2022 that Chasen Cos. planned to flip the vacant lots on South Broadway and South Regester into a mixed-use retail and luxury housing building called The Brooks. Online property records show the company purchased the lots for about $1.75 million and advertised them as a five-story, ground-up project that would feature 49 luxury apartments.\n\nThe Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nToday, the empty lots near the Broadway Market are cordoned off by metal fences. Inside, piles of bricks, rubble and concrete chunks are all that are visible.\n\nBaltimore Banner reporter Greg Morton contributed to this story."

Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.\n\nThe DeepSeek story contains multitudes. It\u2019s a story about the stock market, whether there\u2019s an AI bubble, and how important Nvidia has become to so many people\u2019s financial future. It\u2019s also a story about China, export controls, and American AI dominance. And then, somewhere in there, there\u2019s a story about technology: about how a startup managed to build cheaper, more efficient AI models with few of the capital and technological advantages its competitors have.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, we talk about all these angles and a few more, because DeepSeek is the story of the moment on so many levels. Nilay and David discuss whether companies like OpenAI and Anthropic should be nervous, why reasoning models are such a big deal, and whether all this extra training and advancement actually adds up to much of anything at all. (Nilay has a long comparison to Bluetooth, in case that helps you guess where we land.)\n\nAfter that, we go through our email inbox (vergecast@theverge.com) and the Vergecast Hotline (866-VERGE11), and talk about some of your responses to last week\u2019s question about how people use AI. Thank you so much to everyone who wrote in and called! There are so many interesting, complex, thoroughly human ways we\u2019re all interacting with ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and the rest (but frankly, mostly ChatGPT), and we learned a lot from your examples. They also made us feel many feelings.\n\nIf you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, first on DeepSeek and AI:\n\nAnd in the lightning round:"

            "article_content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) app downloads rose to 1.5 billion in 2024 compared to 800 million reported in 2023, according to a report by SensorTower.\n\nThe report titled \u201cThe State of Mobile 2024,\u2019 revealed that in 2024, apps mentioning AI-related terms in their names, subtitles, or descriptions amassed more than 17 billion downloads globally, an increase from 5 billion downloads in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis accounted for 13 percent of all app downloads that year. Key markets contributing over a billion downloads each included India, the United States, China Mainland, Indonesia, and Brazil,\u201d it said.\n\nIn late 2022, the world witnessed the rise of generative AI applications, driven by the debut of ChatGPT. Since then, interest in these technologies has surged, resulting in growth in in-app purchase (IAP) revenue and downloads.\n\nAccording to SensorTower data, IAP revenue for AI chatbot and AI art generator apps soared from $30 million in 2022 to $455 million in 2023, and nearly $1.3 billion by 2024.\n\nThe report said the United States emerged as the dominant market for generative AI apps in 2024, accounting for 45 percent of global revenue, the United Kingdom (4 percent), Germany (4 percent), Japan (3 percent), and Canada (3 percent) followed, reflecting a strong adoption of AI technology in developed markets.\n\nBrazil ranked as the seventh-largest market for generative AI apps despite not being a top 10 market for overall mobile consumer spending. Conversely, China Mainland lagged, contributing less than 2 percent of IAP revenue for this genre in 2024.\n\nIt said that while AI chatbots remain the most popular subgenre, some of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies have launched their own AI chatbots, including Google Gemini, ByteDance\u2019s Doubao, and Microsoft Copilot.\n\n\u201cThis influx of competition spurred rapid growth in the sector, with AI chatbot downloads climbing 119 percent year-over-year (YoY) in Q4 2024. Although AI art generators experienced slower growth, they still achieved 85 million downloads, up 21 percent YoY,\u201d it stated.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT maintained its position as the market leader, commanding 40 percent of global generative AI consumer spend and 23 percent of total downloads in 2024.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s mobile adoption has skyrocketed since its launch, with monthly active users (MAUs) increasing by 500 percent YoY to more than 160 million in Q3 2024.\n\nAmong apps released in the past three years, ChatGPT was the third-fastest to reach 50 million MAUs globally, achieving the milestone just five months after its launch in May 2023, this growth came despite the app\u2019s delayed release on Google Play in July 2023, several months after its iOS debut.\n\n16 different generative AI apps also achieved at least $10 million in IAP revenue in 2024, while 25 surpassed 10 million downloads.\n\nOn the other hand, developers are increasingly incorporating AI features into apps across various categories. From travel to education to social networking, the possibilities for integrating generative AI are vast.\n\n\u201cApp developers have also shown agility, with the number of apps adding AI-related terms to their names or descriptions more than doubling in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\n\u201cEven as the growth rate of AI-themed apps slowed in 2024, interest remained robust. Over 3,000 apps introduced AI-related terms in 2024, spanning 15 different categories, including productivity, photo & video, lifestyle, finance, and music,\u201d it said.\n\nShare"

I just think the world is more interesting with magic and love is its own special kind of magic.\"\n\nAn author of 15 books with such titles as \"A Shadow Among the Stars\" and \"Soul Sacrifice,\" Davis will release her newest tale Tuesday via 5 Prince Publishing and Books LLC: \"Demons and Tea Leaves.\"\n\n\"I came up with the idea of a woman accidentally summoning a demon. From there I expanded the idea,\" Davis explained. \"What would the circumstances be that she'd accidentally perform a spell, and what then would the demon do?\"\n\nThis particular story is for readers of sweet romances and fans of the paranormal, Davis said.\n\n\"If you enjoy the movie 'Practical Magic' and the show 'Charmed,' I think you'll enjoy 'Demons and Tea Leaves,'\" she said.\n\nAn educator for 10 years, Davis is a longtime North Idahoan. She grew up in Bonners Ferry, where she graduated from high school, then went to North Idaho College for an associate degree and attended the University of Idaho, where she earned a master's degree in elementary education.\n\n\"I love so many things about living here, aside from the cold dark winters,\" she said.\n\nDavis has been writing since she was a teenager. The first story she published was started when she was 18. She said she always knew she wanted to write.\n\n\"I was a voracious reader growing up and felt like I could do just as good as many of the books I enjoyed, so I gave it a shot,\" she said. \"I published quite a few eBooks in my 20s then took a break from writing for a bit as I had my two boys and came back to it in 2020.\"\n\nShe said her favorite thing about writing is exploring a story that comes into her head as a tiny idea and expanding that idea into a full story for others to enjoy.\n\n\"Any time someone reads one of my books, I hope that it gives them a momentary escape from reality and a trip through a fantastically entertaining story,\" Davis said.\n\nDavis will be signing books at It's a Love Story bookstore, 8927 N. Hess St. Suite A, Hayden, at 4:30 p.m. Feb. 21. Her works can be found locally at the Well-Read Moose, It's a Love Story, Kindred Bookstore and the Coeur d'Alene Public Library, as well as on amazon.com.\n\nInfo: authorcourtneydavis.com"

            "article_content": "Thank you. Listen to this article using the player above. \u2716\n\nRead time: 6 minutes\n\nDeveloping a new treatment from concept to clinic is a slow and expensive endeavor. It can take 10\u201315 years and \u2013 accounting for development failures \u2013 cost over $500 million.1\n\n\n\nDespite technological advances in almost every area of the pipeline, the drug development attrition rate has remained at ~90% for several decades.2 As many drugs still fail in trials because of lack of efficacy or toxicity, attention is turning to new technologies that can help the industry gain a faster understanding of whether their candidates are likely to succeed.\n\nExpediting the discovery phase\n\nOne of the greatest advances in drug development has been the advent of multiomics technologies that make it possible to characterize different players in pathogenic pathways and identify the critical hubs which, if modulated, could prevent, halt or reverse disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil recently, our ability to exploit these data was limited because of a lack of computing power, but now machine learning is enabling faster classification of proteins and whole-system, target-agnostic approaches to drug discovery. The bottleneck has shifted \u2013 to one of prioritization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe choice of target now becomes critical because we can\u2019t pursue everything,\u201d says Terry Kenakin, professor of pharmacology at the University of North Carolina. \u201cThere are maybe 800\u20131,500 viable human targets out there and industry is only able to pursue about 350 of these.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvances in technologies such as spatial biology and mass spectrometry imaging are aiding this process of target validation. Spatial biology has advantages over conventional bulk cell omics analysis in that the cellular context is preserved, providing information about where in the cell targets are functioning and interacting with other molecules. Mass spectrometry imaging adds another lens to this approach, enabling users to measure the abundance of metabolites and other molecules in different tissues. This can help to reveal disease mechanisms and identify and validate targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a target is selected, the next challenge is to determine the therapeutic approach. Here, innovations in antibody and peptide engineering mean that targets previously deemed undruggable are now the target for \u201cblockbuster\u201d drugs. For example, efforts to develop drugs that mimic glucagon-like peptide 1 to treat diabetes and obesity were stalling until advances in peptide chemistry led to semaglutide and opened up the field.3\n\n\n\nIn the hunt for small molecules, automation and robotics revolutionized high-throughput screening in the mid-2000s. However, one of the major hurdles to screening large chemical compound libraries is the scale of machines and robotic machinery required, as well as the associated challenges in sourcing enough purified target protein. Now, DNA-encoded libraries are making it possible to screen millions of compounds within days, using very small amounts of the target.4\n\n\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019re at that critical stage where you\u2019re zeroing in on a select group of potential candidates,\u201d says Kenakin. \u201cNow you find out as much as possible about them to differentiate between them and to understand how to use them as probes when they go into clinical trials.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding your candidate drugs\n\nThe most common causes of drug development failure remain lack of efficacy or toxicity; but current methods for predicting these aren\u2019t yet mitigating this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe current paradigm \u2013 the model of validation, screening and then optimization talked about so frequently \u2013 isn\u2019t wrong, but each stage has become like a box-checking exercise to progress to the next stage,\u201d says Duxin Sun, professor of pharmaceutical science at the University of Michigan. \u201cMany years ago, we didn\u2019t fulfill any of these steps and we still had a 10% success rate in drug development.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSun argues that some of the key attributes of candidate drugs are not being fully optimized before proceeding, and that target validation needs to be more closely tied to lead optimization to ensure the potency and specificity of candidate drugs is pharmacokinetically- and dose-relevant to the intended target in humans. He\u2019s proposing a new approach called STAR (structure\u2013tissue/cell selectivity\u2013activity relationship), which uses machine learning to enhance efficiency by addressing on- and off-target activities early on in development.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo often we see we can make a compound work in animals, but it requires a dose that when later extrapolated to humans is limited by toxicity,\u201d says Duxin Sun. \u201cWe can see early on that there\u2019ll be a lack of efficacy, yet we don\u2019t own the failure at this stage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSun\u2019s sentiment is mirrored by Kenakin, who recently wrote about the importance of knowing the pharmacology of your molecule before making candidate prioritization decisions.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPharmacology is a unique science. It\u2019s the only discipline that furnishes scales that can predict drug activity in different physiological and pathophysiological settings,\u201d says Kenakin. \u201cThese detailed studies are done in industry settings, historically, but we now have more models, scales and theories we can use.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard readouts pharmacologists would use \u2013 changes in calcium or cyclic AMP \u2013 have now been expanded to a treasure trove of functional assays, such as bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). These can measure the proximity and interaction of molecules within a system and have revealed new types of signaling, such as biased signaling in G-protein coupled-receptor cascades, which previously would have been missed in traditional pharmacology models.\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether with other advances such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and molecular dynamics that allow characterization of binding at previously unknown allosteric sites, this has \u201cfreed us up\u201d, says Kenakin. \u201cWhen you have a candidate you\u2019ve already invested millions in, you may as well invest a little more to know as much about it as you can. There\u2019s a very good chance it will fail, and you don\u2019t want to follow it up with a compound that does the same things.\u201d\n\nLearning from clinical evaluation\n\nAlthough many drug failures are attributed to lack of efficacy or adverse effects, incorrect trial design and not recruiting the \u201cright\u201d patients are also commonly blamed. Jimeng Sun is a computer scientist working on applying artificial intelligence (AI) to healthcare challenges, who spotted an opportunity to use AI to improve the end-to-end process of clinical research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe clinical trial space has an exciting set of problems \u2013 from planning trial designs at the beginning, right through to regulatory submission,\u201d he says. \u201cOne task we\u2019ve been focusing on is to take information about past trials and create a neural network model, to predict the outcome of similar future trials.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first iteration, called HINT, they captured all the information before the trial started \u2013 disease target, eligibility criteria and drug molecule.7 They then connected this to the external knowledge base of all historical trials, both for trials that failed and those that succeeded. In later versions, they placed more statistical weighting on recent trials of a similar design, to reflect the fact that trial designs have improved over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the trial design phase, the medical director spends a lot of time trying to optimize criteria to recruit a sufficient number of patients while excluding those with specific confounding factors or comorbidities that might influence the trial results,\u201d explains Jimeng Sun. \u201cRight now, there are a lot of pharma and biotech companies looking into this type of predictive model to help them assess their designs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nElsewhere in the clinical trial process, Sun is also developing AI tools that can generate quality control trial documents and is looking at other areas ripe for intervention, such as helping sponsors choose the best hospital sites for their studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDifferent study sites all have investigators and teams with different experience and different patients, so we are developing a tool for pharma companies to rank clinical sites that are optimal for running their trials and avoid competing trials,\u201d explains Sun.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tool, called fair ranking with missing modalities (FRAMM), enables pharma to simultaneously optimize site selection for both enrolment and diversity and has already been shown to increase diversity compared with traditional enrollment methods.8 \u201cAnother area is trial matching, where we can match patient records with inclusion criteria for trials, to boost recruitment further,\u201d said Jimeng Sun.\n\nFuture outlook\n\nToday\u2019s drug developers now have the technology to drug almost any molecule, but with that opportunity comes increasing challenges along the pipeline to fully characterize these drugs and design trials that set them up for success.9 By combining deeper characterization of target and drug molecules in the preclinical phase, and learning from the clinical failures of the past, the outlook could look more optimistic for the next generation of drugs entering the pipeline.\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "As AI abounds and consolidation comes calling, the marcomms agency landscape is poised for a significant shakeup in 2025.\n\nBut where some see challenge, others seize opportunity. And so, to coincide with our Predictions event on thedrum.com, throughout this week our journalists have been making some predictions of their own by spotlighting the agencies they believe will dominate the headlines this year.\n\nThey have done so armed with some important information, as all the agencies featured across this series have earned The Drum Recommends status on the strength of their recent performance and quality of work.\n\nAMV BBDO, Hearts & Science and Code and Theory were among those recognized in part one. It was the turn of FCB, Mower and Whalar in part two. Then Area 23, David Madrid, Zulu Alpha Kilo enjoyed their moment in part three. And, in part four, Ogilvy UK, Monks and DDB Colombia all featured. Today, we have more heavy hitters to recognize from across the globe.\n\nSo scroll on to hear from our latest Agencies to Watch honorees about how they\u2019re preparing themselves for the major trends upon us in 2025.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nThe Accenture Song-owned ad agency featured prominently at The Drum Awards for Advertising, winning Golds in the Finance, Sports and Sound Design categories, while its S\u00e3o Paulo office partnered with Dove to celebrate 20 years of its \u2018Campaign for Real Beauty.\u2019\n\nWhat key trends do you foresee defining the industry in 2025?\n\nMark Green, global chief executive officer: Fighting evil in the algorithm. As content becomes increasingly polarized, brands will have to fight the urge to settle in the middle and play it safe. Growth for brands will be in unifying, not dividing.\n\nThe creative differentiator. Creativity will increasingly be the differentiation in business as new ideas are copied and replicated as quickly as DeepSeek, for example. Therefore, the power of brand becomes more crucial.\n\nHigher-order creativity. While robots and AI will transform jobs, industries and indeed advertising, human empathy and higher-order creativity will be the saviors. They were, are and will be the answer to growth.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nGreen: A truly global Droga5 \u2013 fueled by borderless creativity and a renewed creative ambition \u2013 will be an even more powerful weapon as we continue pushing our creative boundaries further and beyond advertising. We firmly believe our best work is ahead of us. We have an exciting group of leaders that have the ambition to take creativity much further than advertising and we have a unique relationship with Accenture that brings the best of creativity, technology and consulting together. We have also learned a lot from successes and failures in equal measure and will now put this to work in the best way possible. New offices, new leaders and exciting new work will be the result.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nGreen: Dove\u2019s \u2018The Code\u2019: To celebrate 20 years of its pioneering \u2018Campaign for Real Beauty,\u2019 Dove partnered with Droga5 S\u00e3o Paulo to reinforce its commitment to real beauty. Vowing never to use AI to create or distort women\u2019s images, \u2018The Code\u2019 demonstrated how adding the phrase \u2018According to Dove Real Beauty campaign\u2019 to AI-generated prompts resulted in dramatically more diverse, inclusive, and authentic images. This sets a new standard for brands navigating evolving technology.\n\nSolament\u2019s \u2018The Down-Less Down Jacket\u2019: In Japan, Droga5 Tokyo applied a new technology and called it Solament, a unique material that absorbs near-infrared sunlight to generate heat and protect people from the cold. We then created the brand and developed a prototype for a transparent puffer jacket. This is a product and innovation going beyond advertising.\n\nSydney Opera House\u2019s \u2018Play It Safe\u2019: Celebrating 50 years, Droga5 Australia created a musical tribute to one of the world\u2019s most celebrated cultural landmarks, the Sydney Opera House. The musical created in collaboration with Tim Minchin reminded us of the power of creativity and its endless possibilities when you don\u2019t \u2018Play It Safe.\u2019 This is the power of entertainment for brands.\n\nBosch\u2019s \u2018#LikeABosch\u2019: Last summer, Bosch named Droga5 its US Agency of Record, tasked with ambitiously expanding Bosch\u2019s presence in the US market. Those ambitious plans with Droga5 include leading the German engineering and tech company to make its Super Bowl debut with an extension of Bosch\u2019s 2024 #LikeABosch platform.\n\nNRMA\u2019s \u2018A Help Company\u2019: Celebrating 100 years NRMA wanted to transform from an insurance company that helps people to a help company that does insurance. We created a new brand platform to deliver this message while also taking creativity further across digital channels, product design and service delivery. This is more than a marketing transformation but rather a wholesale customer transformation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe media agency had another award-laden year, the best yet in its 34-year history, picking up gongs at shows including The Drum Awards for Media and The Drum Awards for Marketing, including Gold in the Travel and Tourism category for its \u2018If You\u2019re Into It\u2019 campaign for The V&A.\n\nWhat key trends do you foresee defining the industry in 2025?\n\nPaul Knight, incoming CEO, PHD UK: In a market that is experiencing media fragmentation, asset fragmentation and capability fragmentation, marketers need 2025 to be the year where consumer experiences are better connected.\n\nThe agencies that will thrive in 2025 will be the ones that can best connect their talent, technology, and data to accelerate and elevate new solutions for clients and deliver better brand experiences for consumers.\n\nKey to this will be agencies\u2019 abilities to harness AI to improve efficiency in areas such as data distillation, audience pattern recognition and lateral thinking. We will also start to see the emergence of agentic AI, which acts autonomously on a user\u2019s behalf, completing complex tasks without prompting.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one thing that will continue to define the industry but isn\u2019t a new trend. When we get to the end of 2025, we will yet again be celebrating ingenious, creative thinking that creates real competitive advantage for clients. And long may that continue.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nSarah Nugent, managing director, PHD London: Following a year where we successfully retained \u00a3250m+ in incumbent pitches and added almost \u00a3150m of net new wins to our client list, we\u2019ve entered 2025 with significant business momentum and with Knighty\u2019s imminent arrival as CEO in February we are full of energy to bring PHD\u2019s new \u2018Intelligence. Connected\u2019 positioning to life in the work we do.\n\nWe exist to help clients Outthink, Outpace and Outgrow the competition so we will be continuing to prioritize the power of thinking to develop and grow new products and services that are designed to offer clients new solutions to new challenges, building on our recent successes in areas such as data consultancy and gaming.\n\nWe\u2019re already underway with this, having already launched a new UK cultural insight platform called Culture Currents, which unveiled new research into the importance of brands embracing optimism in a challenging macro-economic and political climate. There will be much more of that to come this year and as an agency, we\u2019re also massively optimistic about what 2025 will bring.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nEuan Hudghton, chief brand and experience officer, PHD UK: 2024 was a standout year for work at PHD UK, becoming the most awarded year in the agency\u2019s 34-year history, including winning five Grand Prix awards.\n\nAs importantly, our winning campaigns also reflected the breadth of work a modern media agency now needs to deliver for its clients. Work that was effective, creative, and inclusive.\n\nPHD clients won six IPA Effectiveness awards, including the Grand Prix for McCain.\n\nOur \u2018Streams of (un)consciousness\u2019 campaign for the British Heart Foundation flatlined the Twitch streams of 14 prominent gaming influencers to promote CPR training, directly leading to a life being saved.\n\nAward-winning campaigns for Andrex ranged from driving sales in new retail media spaces to partnering with ITV to redesign the Big Brother diary room chair made from toilet rolls.\n\nWe were also delighted to do our bit to make media more inclusive, brokering audio description and British Sign Language partnerships with ITV and Channel 4 for Guinness and Virgin Atlantic.\n\nAnd there\u2019ll be more of that kind of work to come in 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNils Leonard\u2019s hot shop continued to impress in 2024, its British Airways \u2018Windows\u2019 work picking up gongs at Cannes Lions and The Drum Awards for Advertising.\n\nUncommon\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nAI won\u2019t define 2025 \u2013 our reaction to it will. As AI mass-produces mediocrity, rare ideas, taste and beauty become more valuable. The industry\u2019s fear is misplaced; automation pushes creativity further.\n\nPolarization will shift from risk to strategy. Brands must take bold stands, leaving some behind while fostering loyal communities. Forget playing it safe \u2013 conviction and agitation will drive sharper, more meaningful work.\n\n2025 will be a landmark year for design. No longer just a backdrop, design itself will spark conversations, provoke reactions and shape brand narratives. Smart brands will harness its power for fame, engagement and cultural relevance.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWe\u2019re taking our design practice to the next level with more projects \u2013 off the back of the biggest rebrand in entertainment history for EA Sports FC and our disruptive graphic design system for Vimeo. As well as exploring new avenues including retail design \u2013 as we\u2019re set to redesign The Ordinary\u2019s store experience globally.\n\nArchitecture continues to be another area of growth in our founding partnership with Thomas Heatherwick\u2019s \u2018Humanise\u2019 movement. Last year, we launched UnLandmarks, a campaign using AI to reimagine iconic British buildings through the lens of monotonous architectural trends. The project is set to expand to the US in 2025.\n\nUnrest is an accelerator developing impact-led consumer brands. Based in our London studio since its inception, we can\u2019t wait to continue to cultivate this year\u2019s cohort as the program\u2019s continued brand partner.\n\nThis year also sees the launch of our third film feature, The Thing with Feathers, which premiered at Sundance 2025 with rave reviews, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and directed by Dylan Southern.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe redefined Christmas with JD Sports\u2019 #1 YouTube ad; launched Monzo\u2019s first brand campaign and ATMmm stunt, making it Marketing Society\u2019s Brand of the Year; crafted British Airways\u2019 Cannes-winning \u2018Windows\u2019 and viral safety video; made reference point B2B work with Hiscox helping the insurer reach record profits; designed the first-ever brand identity with resolution at its core for Vimeo; challenged beauty industry standards with provocative outdoor for The Ordinary speaking to the brand\u2019s philosophy of science over celebrity and celebrated Erling Haaland\u2019s quirks, challenging the serious nature of sports marketing with Beats \u2013 all combining creativity and effectiveness to pick up four Effies and continue to build brands the world wished existed.\n\nAn award-winning 2024 for the global media agency saw it pick up 10 trophies at The Drum Awards for Media, including the Chair\u2019s Award for its work with Transport for London.\n\nWavemaker\n\nWhat key trends do you foresee defining the industry in 2025?\n\nHow long is a piece of string? In such a fast-paced, constantly changing industry like ours, there\u2019s always something influencing or impacting it in any given year.\n\nRather than trends, I like to focus on what\u2019s keeping our clients awake at night or the things they are trying to navigate to deliver sustainable business growth \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s going to define the industry and what we need to do to adapt. I believe this year, there\u2019ll be three things frequenting our agenda.\n\nThe first is HFSS \u2013 in October this year we\u2019ll see the HFSS advertising legislation come into place. This isn\u2019t just going to impact HFSS brands; it\u2019s going to impact everyone \u2013 we\u2019ll see increased competition for premium inventory and in turn, an impact cost that\u2019s going to take some careful navigation to minimize the impact on ROI. The second is the \u2018messy middle\u2019; it\u2019s a topic that\u2019s never really gone away and one that clients and agencies have been navigating together, but I believe this year we\u2019ll see a renewed focus on working hard to maximize the power of the messy middle. And last but certainly not least is the intelligent use of AI (yes, it\u2019s being mentioned again!) in transforming creativity and problem-solving. It\u2019s definitely transforming how we operate as an agency, freeing up more space to focus on the client challenges that really need that human brain power.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting time to be part of WPP and GroupM. With lots of new leadership in place and a whole new way of operating, our platform advances, product innovation and collaborative spirit are serving us well, making us all stronger. The power of the group and the broader network is really enabling all of us at Wavemaker to live and breathe positive provocation, so I think you\u2019ll see a renewed energy from us this year in really provoking the industry and demonstrating what sets us apart as an agency. It\u2019s that positively provocative spirit that really gives us the focus on creating unrivaled work; I\u2019m confident that you\u2019re going to be seeing it in spades from Wavemaker UK in 2025.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nOh, blimey, this is a bit like having to pick a favorite child! I\u2019m incredibly proud of all our client work in 2024 - we really did see a step change in the volume of unrivaled work we were creating, powered by some great agency-wide initiatives that galvanized everyone behind the work. Some of the standout campaigns include \u2018Bonjour, Hello, Ciao, Ola, Konichiwa!\u2019 for TfL, where we combined real-time train and flight data into a globally recognized DOOH campaign for the Elizabeth Line; our groundbreaking activation for Paramount that transformed Piccadilly Lights into an ancient stone mosaic for Gladiator II; and our UnXpected FM campaign for the UK Government which tackled road safety in an authentic and impactful way.\n\nI\u2019m also really proud of our partnership with Morrisons, which shines a light on what makes Morrisons unique, as well as our work in the data space with Merlin and William Hill that leveraged our proprietary technology \u2018Geograph\u2019 to deliver business impact for both businesses.\n\nIt\u2019s always great to look back, but I\u2019m super excited for what\u2019s in store for 2025 when it comes to the work\u2026 watch this space!\n\nThe B2B specialist won in the Media and Technology-Led Innovation categories at The Drum Awards for B2B 2024, with its work for Juniper Networks and Ecologi.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nCreativity as a strategic brand/business asset: Creativity in B2B has made giant strides in recent years. The momentum for higher-order creativity \u2013 creativity that serves as a strategic asset to move a business forward into the future \u2013 is now unstoppable.\n\nThe essential role of buying groups. Every B2B purchase of consequence involves a buying group. Functional \u201cpoint\u201d buyers. Anonymous buyers, Hidden buyers. Building brand availability and preference at \u2018day one\u2019 of the purchase process is the only way to create and cultivate demand. The understanding that buying groups are not monoliths \u2013 with advocates, antagonists and neutrals all present within the same buying group \u2013 will influence brand strategy and activation going forward.\n\nThe 95/5 rule will become more nuanced. Within the 95% of buyers who are not in-market at any given time, there is a cohort of 25%-30% that is edging closer to market. B2B marketers will develop specific strategies to engage these \u2018in-betweens\u2019 and follow them as they progress into and through the funnel.\n\nBDX as B2B\u2019s default go-to-market model: Truly unified brand-to-demand marketing will become the rule rather than the exception. Brands will gain maturity by applying the Brand-to-Demand Experience (BDX) model. From organizational structures to omnichannel creative platforms to orchestration platforms, BDX will move to underpin effective B2B marketing.\n\nThe re-definition of the role of brand in B2B. In-market, out-of-market and in between. Top, middle and bottom of funnel. Brand\u2019s multiplier effect on performance marketing. The magnitude and expansiveness of brand\u2019s role in driving demand and growth is becoming a mainstream B2B belief. Brand investment will grow in turn because it must.\n\nAI will move from hype to focused, strategic reality. While experimentation will continue for years, as will the AI arms race, marketers and agencies will focus on a core set of use cases that go beyond tactical enhancements to play a strategic role in all areas of value delivery.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWith new global CEO Kate MacNevin now at the helm, Stein IAS is continuing its growth journey and increasing its growth trajectory. Stein\u2019s positioning \u2013 Building the World\u2019s Most Demanded B2B Brands \u2013 connects the agency to the most consequential brands globally. Our Brand-to-Demand Experience (BDX) framework released at Cannes addresses the most critical challenge faced by B2B marketers \u2013 building brand strength in order drive demand strength and sustainable growth. As we scale BDX, we anticipate senior hires across the agency, particularly in creative, strategy and business leadership.\n\nIn 2025 and beyond, Stein IAS will continue to lead the industry BDX agenda by: launching the first B2B brand-to-demand maturity study, including industry perspectives on media allocation; partnering with LinkedIn, IAA, ANA and the ANA Lions CMO Growth Council to develop a Future of B2B Buying model; partnering with Brand Finance on the 2025 Most Valuable B2B Brands Index, focusing on the imperative for B2B enterprises to invest in brand to accelerate growth and build enterprise value; partnering strategically with ecosystem leaders, including LinkedIn and 6sense, to unify brand and demand and up-level effectiveness and efficiency for the world\u2019s B2B brands; and launching v2 of our proprietary Origin data platform that leverages AI and direct feeds from LinkedIn\u2019s APIs to develop more relevant and actionable personas, audiences, messaging and content, richer segmentation, and more effective media planning and activation.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nThe Mack Trucks \u2018By America\u2019s Side\u2019 campaign reconnected the soul of the iconic Mack Trucks brand with truck/fleet owners and operators. While the audience\u2019s affinity with Mack is considerable going back many years, it had lessened over time and needed to be strengthened anew in a highly competitive market. To accomplish this, we brought Mack back \u2013 the famous bulldog mascot that adorns the hood of every Mack truck \u2013 and made him the centerpiece of the campaign focused on Mack\u2019s role in helping to build America for 125 years.\n\nWe worked with Juniper Networks to progress its brand-to-demand marketing, driving performance and efficiency. \u2018The Now Way To Network\u2019 campaign positioned Juniper\u2019s first-mover, AI-native enterprise networking solutions, driving brand salience and connecting top-of-funnel to pipeline through highly orchestrated customer journeys across lines of business. Along the way, Juniper and Stein won an ANA B2 Awards Gold for Multi-Year Impact and our first-ever ARF David Ogilvy Award.\n\nIn introducing the new Elimini carbon removals brand (launched by global biomass leader Drax), Stein IAS and MSQ partner agencies The Gate and MMT needed to build category awareness, brand awareness and brand credibility, all while driving immediate demand. Our \u2018Removing Carbon for Good\u2019 brand-to-demand campaign added urgency and immediacy to the carbon removal conversation, establishing Elimini as a market leader and initiating a pipeline of enterprise customers ready to act."

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nLike most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface \u2014 even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.\n\nThe mantle, a zone between our planet\u2019s thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended. But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.\n\nAmong the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous \u201csupercontinents\u201d buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates. One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean. Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet\u2019s mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn\u2019t as well-stirred by Earth\u2019s internal churning as once believed. And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature.\n\n\u201cThese findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,\u201d said Claire Richardson, a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.\n\n\u201cResolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,\u201d Richardson told CNN in an email. \u201cOpen questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what\u2019s really going on down there.\u201d\n\nClues revealed by waves\n\nResearchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet. When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth\u2019s deep interior.\n\nOver the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary. Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall. However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza, lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\n\n\u201cTheir origin and whether they are long-lived structures \u2014 it\u2019s widely debated,\u201d Talavera-Soza said.\n\nEarth maps in the top row show the positions of two buried supercontinents \u2014 also called large low shear velocity provinces or LLSVPs \u2014 and how they affect speed and attenuation, or damping, of seismic waves. The bottom row shows the same LLSVPs in a cross-section view of Earth. Utrecht University\n\nEarlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents. This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.\n\nVelocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said. But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions. Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were \u201ckind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss, a professor of structure and composition of Earth\u2019s deep interior at Utrecht University.\n\n\u201cThere was no information about that,\u201d Deuss said. \u201cWe only knew that seismic waves slowed down.\u201d\n\nIn the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones\u2019 composition and activity. They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.\n\nIn music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said. Examining the attenuation of the waves \u2014 along with changes in wave speed \u2014 could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs\u2019 makeup. The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.\n\nWave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics. Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave\u2019s energy.\n\nOlder than \u2018slab graveyards\u2019\n\nThe researchers' findings could transform the understanding of plate tectonics. Here, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake leaves devastation in the Noto region of Japan's Ishikawa prefecture in January 2024. Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOther studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle. Around them were \u201cslab graveyards\u201d of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said. They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.\n\nHowever, the new model showed that while seismic waves\u2019 velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn\u2019t lose much energy. By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.\n\nResearchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures. Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time. Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study. Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.\n\n\u201cOur study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. \u201cThis implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.\u201d\n\nThis discovery follows another recent revelation about even more \u201csunken worlds\u201d that contradict the notion of a blended mantle. Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth\u2019s subduction zones \u2014 regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other. But earlier this year, another team of scientists identified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents\u2019 interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.\n\n\u201cApparently, such zones in the Earth\u2019s mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,\u201d said Thomas Schouten, lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in a statement.\n\nThe model in the new study \u2014 the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle \u2014 will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth\u2019s surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.\n\n\u201cIt maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth\u2019s interior,\u201d she said.\n\nThe findings could transform researchers\u2019 understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth\u2019s core, Deuss said. Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.\n\n\u201cThese LLSVPs have been there for a long time \u2014 if they\u2019ve been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years. They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located. We can\u2019t prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,\u201d Deuss said.\n\n\u201cFrom this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.\u201d\n\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine."

            "article_content": "OVER the last four centuries, the physical sciences have undergone a metamorphosis marked by breath-taking discoveries and the evolution of sophisticated the\u00ad\u00ad\u00adories about the nature of reality. From Isaac Newton\u2019s ground-breaking work on matter and motion, to Albert Einstein\u2019s revolutionary ideas about energy and space-time, and finally to David Bohm\u2019s hypothesis linking quantum mechanics to consciousness, each era has expanded humanity\u2019s understanding of the universe. This transition paves the way for better understanding of the interface between science and spirituality.\n\nThe groundwork for classical mechanics was laid by Sir Isaac Newton. His matter hy\u00ad\u00adpothesis postulated that the universe was composed of indivisible discrete particles called atoms, governed by invariable laws of motion and gravity. Newton\u2019s landmark work, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathe\u00admatica, integrated the motion and gravitation laws into a collected framework. He provided a predictable and perceptible understanding of natural phenomena.\n\nFor example, his equations explained how stellar bodies move in elliptical orbits. Newton\u2019s reductionist ideas formulated matter as dormant and passive, subject only to external forces. While Newton\u2019s ideology successfully elaborated macroscopic phenomena, questions about the nature of light, electromagnetic waves, and the behaviour of matter at exceedingly small scales remained unanswered.\n\nAdvances in applied physics and the discovery of phenomena such as radioactivity exposed substantial gaps in Newtonian mechanics by the early 20th century. These challenges were consummated in the innovative work of Albert Einstein, who radically reshaped humanity\u2019s understanding of energy, matter, and space-time. Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity introduced the famous equation, e=mc2. This equation smashed the Newtonian assumption of matter as inert and invariable, showing that matter is a concentrated form of energy instead. His general theory of relativity further revisited gravity as the curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy.\n\nThe boundaries between physics, spirituality, and metaphysics are fluid.\n\nEinstein\u2019s ideas replaced the deterministic framework of Newton with a relativistic model, where time and space were no longer considered absolute but rather relative to the observer. This drastic change laid the groundwork for innovations such as GPS technology and nuclear energy.\n\nDavid Bohm introduced a radical outlook that sought to desegregate the perplexing aspects of quantum mechanics with broader inquiries about reality and consciousness in the mid-20th century. Influenced by Eastern philosophy and quantum physics, Bohm hypothesised that the universe is interconnected, operating as a holistic system at all levels. His implicate order theory suggested that the visible, tactile universe (the explicate order) emanates from an elementary, enwrapped reality (the implicate order). This idea addressed the ability of particles to exhibit wave-particle duality and distant interactions, where particles influence each other expeditiously across gigantic distances.\n\nBohm\u2019s work outstretched beyond physics into the domain of consciousness, which is synonymous with awareness of God. Bohm\u2019s implicate order theory explains the mind-matter connection, suggesting that consciousness plays a role in orchestrating reality thus influencing interdisciplinary research in the realms of neurosciences, philosophy, and spirituality. Bohm\u2019s approach signifies an important shift from reductionism to a more inclusive understanding of the universe and humanity. The science that was repulsive to an idea of religious belief thus began to embrace religious ideas culminating with the discovery of the Higgs boson or \u2018God particle\u2019, completing the stan\u00ad\u00ad-dard model of particle physics. This evolution is illustrated in the Quran as: Allah \u201cbuilt the universe with great might, and We are certainly expanding it\u201d (51:47).\n\nThe progress of physical science reflects humanity\u2019s ongoing desire to understand the true nature of reality. After these step-wise calculations, we are now beginning to realise that the boundaries between physics, philosophy, spirituality, and metaphysics are fluid and not as rigid as once thought. Each archetype has not only transfigured our understanding of the physical universe but also reshaped our scientific, philosophical, and sociocultural viewpoints.\n\nThe likes of Newton, Einstein and Bohm remind us that the pursuit of knowledge is an unending journey, challenging us to expand our horizons. As we advance from the early 17th-century concept of the nonexistence of God in science towards more recent awareness of consciousness, these ideas continue to evolve into new lines of inquiry thus paving the way to connect science with the ultimate Creator of the universe.\n\nThe writer is an assistant professor at West Virginia University School of Medicine.\n\nX: @mohsinfareed\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 31st, 2025"

The Wawel Dragon\u2013or Smok Wawelski\u2013in Krakow, Poland will have to hold its fiery breath so that authorities can see why it has been guzzling too much fuel lately.\n\nKrzysztof Wojdowski, spokesman for Krakow\u2019s road infrastructure office, told the Associated Press that officials will inspect the gas lines and pipes that feed the19-feet metal dragon to look for ways to reduce energy bills.

The beast lived in a den under Wawel Hill and terrorized the residents of King Krak\u2019s city\u2013current day Krakow. Some tales say that the beast fed on cattle, while others say it only ate young virgins. No knight was able to vanquish the beast with force, but then a young shoemaker named Skuba outsmarted the dragon. Skuba took a ram\u2019s hide and loaded it with sulfur and pitch. He placed the ram hide in front of the dragon\u2019s den as bait. The dragon ate the hide and immediately felt a shooting pain and burning in the throat. In order to quench this burning thirst, the dragon drank from the nearby Vistula River. Depending on who is telling the story, the dragon either drank so much water that it burst from fullness or the gasses produced by a mix of water and sulfur caused the dragon to explode. Either way, the beast was vanquished and the townfold\u2013and very brave shoemaker\u2013rejoiced.\n\n[ Related: Could dragons be real? Not in the way we think. ]\n\nThe fire-breathing sculpture now stands at the foot of Wawel, near the dragon\u2019s former den. Visitors can now explore into this dark cave that leads down from Wawel Hill to the banks of the Vistula River.\n\nTo see another sculpture with a fire element, you can visit Herning, Denmark\u2019s Elia.

Now, they meet with a potential shot at the undisputed light heavyweight championship on the line.\n\nBenavidez (29-0, 24 KO) twice held the WBC super middleweight title and never lost the title in the ring. After winning the title the first time with a split decision over Ronald Gavril in 2017, he successfully defended the belt in their 2018 rematch. Later that year, it was reported that Benavidez tested positive for cocaine in a Voluntary Anti-Doping Agency drug test and was stripped of his title and handed a four-month suspension.\n\nBenavidez would regain the title in his second fight after his suspension, stopping Anthony Dirrell in the ninth round of their title bout. He would never defend that title, failing to make weight for his first planned defense against Roamer Alexis Angulo and being stripped of the belt again.\n\nMore dominance of the division continued for Benavidez in the ring, including picking up the WBC interim title in 2022. Alvarez collected all four world titles at 168 pounds but repeatedly blew off any talk of facing Benavidez, the clear top contender for his championships.\n\nAs it became increasingly clear that a fight with one of boxing's biggest stars was never going to come to fruition, Benavidez made the jump to 175 pounds where he again picked up a WBC interim title by defeating former world champ Oleksandr Gvozdyk. The fight with Gvozdyk proved a bit more difficult than expected, partially because of torn hand ligaments suffered prior to the bout and partially because Benavidez's endurance seemed to fail him as the fight hit the later rounds.\n\nMorrell (11-0, 9 KO) also spent plenty of time as an Alvarez mandatory challenger and would have been seen as a very legitimate opponent for the Mexican superstar. Despite winning the WBA \"regular\" championship in just his fifth professional fight and making five consecutive defenses, Morrell was facing the same lack of interest from Alvarez and also made the jump to 175 pounds, defeating Radivoje Kalajdzic to win the \"regular\" title at the new weight.\n\nLike Benavidez's division-welcoming fight with Gvozdyk, Morrell struggled at times in his light heavyweight debut, taking a decision over Radivoje Kalajdzic in a fight that was much closer than the official scorecards indicated. Prior to that fight, only two of Morrell's opponents had managed to last past the fourth round.\n\nThe prize that eluded both men at super middleweight -- a fight with multiple world championships on the line -- seems to be in reach now. The winner will become the obvious challenger for the winner of the rematch between undisputed light heavyweight champ Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol, which takes place on Feb. 22.\n\nBenavidez vs. Morrell fight card, odds\n\nDavid Benavidez -230 vs. David Morrell +180, light heavyweights\n\nBrandon Figueroa (c) -185 vs. Stephen Fulton +150, WBC featherweight title\n\nIsaac Cruz -900 vs. Angel Fierro +550, junior welterweights\n\nJesus Ramos -2500 vs. Jeison Rosario +1100, junior middleweights\n\nMirco Cuello -650 vs. Christian Olivo Barreda +450, featherweights\n\nYoenli Hernandez -2500 vs. Angel Ruiz Astorga +1100, middleweights\n\nKaipo Gallegos -600 vs. Leonardo Padilla +425, junior lightweights\n\nJose Benavidez Jr. -1100 vs. Danny Rosenberger +650, middleweights\n\nDaniel Blancas -2000 vs. Juan Barajas +900, super middleweights\n\nCurmel Moton -4000 vs. Frank Zaldivar +1200, lightweights\n\nWhere to watch Benavidez vs. Morrell Jr.\n\nDate: Feb. 1 | Start time: 8 p.m. ET (main card)\n\nFeb. 1 | 8 p.m. ET (main card) Location: T-Mobile Arena -- Las Vegas\n\nT-Mobile Arena -- Las Vegas TV channel/stream: Amazon PPV ($79.99)\n\nPrediction\n\nThis fight could well come down to which man has made the bigger adjustments to being at light heavyweight. As talented as both men are, there's no getting around the fact that both were less than their usual stellar selves in their first fights at the weight. It is worth mentioning that neither man took a light touch in their 175-pound debuts but they just didn't look as dominant as they had been for years at super middleweight.\n\nMorrell has been a thudding puncher for most of his career, blasting out opponents with power that is only improved by having solid technique as an accomplished amateur. Benavidez's style is a bit more raw, though it has always been effective and he's clearly sharpened his tools as his career has progressed.\n\nIf the fight breaks down into a firefight, either man has the power to land a fight-ending shot. Morrell could look at Benavidez fading late in his most recent fight as a sign he needs to try to pick spots to push the pace and drag things into the later rounds to truly take over while Benavidez. That said, it would be surprising to see either man take a particularly safe approach in the fight and Benavidez's higher level of professional experience should make him more comfortable in edging out the fight.

            "article_content": "Geneva \u2014 The United Nations on Friday voiced alarm at rampant violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, as the M23 armed group pushed deeper into the country, warning of summary executions and widespread rapes. The group's capture of most of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, earlier in the week was a dramatic escalation in a region that has seen decades of conflict involving multiple armed groups.\n\nThe U.N. on Thursday said that it was \"deeply concerned\" by \"credible reports\" that the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels were advancing south from Goma to Bukavu \u2014 capital of the neighboring South Kivu province.\n\nU.N. rights office spokesman Jeremy Laurence said that since the start of the crisis, bombs had struct at least two sites housing internally displaced people (IDPs), \"causing civilian casualties.\"\n\n\"We have also documented summary executions of at least 12 people by M23 between 26 and 28 January,\" he told reporters in Geneva.\n\nMembers of the M23 armed group walk alongside residents on a street in the Keshero neighborhood of Goma, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Jan. 27, 2025. STR/AFP/Getty\n\nIn areas under M23 control in South Kivu, such as Minova, he said the group had \"occupied schools and hospitals, forced IDPs out of camps and subjected the civilian population to forced conscription and forced labor.\"\n\nThe rights office, he said, had documented \"cases of conflict-related sexual violence by the army and allied Wazalendo fighters in Kalehe territory.\"\n\n\"We are verifying reports that 52 women were raped by Congolese troops in South Kivu, including alleged reports of gang rape,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, he pointed to reports from DRC officials indicating that at least 165 women were raped by male inmates when more than 4,000 prisoners broke out of Goma's Muzenze prison on January 27, as the M23 began its assault on the town.\n\n\"Conflict-related sexual violence has been an appalling feature of armed conflict in eastern DRC for decades,\" Laurence said.\n\nMore than 400,000 people have been displaced since the start of the year due to ongoing clashes between M23 rebels and Congolese security forces in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Efnan Ipsir/Anadolu/Getty\n\nU.N. rights chief Volker Turk \"is particularly concerned that this latest escalation risks deepening the risk of conflict-related sexual violence much further,\" he added.\n\nLaurence cautioned that the \"widespread proliferation of weapons in Goma\" was \"exacerbating\" those risks.\n\nHe also called for investigations to bring \"the perpetrators to justice\" and to ensure accountability.\n\nRuth Maclean, West Africa bureau chief for the New York Times, told CBS News this week that the increase of violence in Goma was of particular concern as, for months, people from the surrounding countryside have poured into the city seeking respite from fighting. Many of the displaced people, Maclean said, were living out in the open, leaving them at increased risk.\n\nThe U.N., many Western governments and the DRC all accuse Rwanda's government of backing M23 in a bid to control and exploit their much larger eastern neighbor's vast mineral resources, in an escalation of a crisis that has been playing out for many years across several international borders."

Flash reads are 2.2x faster, enabling quicker insights and decision-making.\n\nDQ: Could you elaborate on how Exadata delivers cost efficiency while maintaining performance?\n\nAshish: Cost efficiency in Exadata X11M stems from its ability to perform more work with fewer resources. For example, the latest AMD EPYC processors provide immense computing power, enabling faster data processing. This means fewer servers are required to handle workloads, reducing energy consumption, data center space, and cooling needs.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAdditionally, Exadata incorporates advanced power management features. Businesses can automate the system to run at high power during peak times and shift to low-power modes during off-peak hours, ensuring optimal energy utilization. These measures not only lower operational costs but also enhance sustainability, which is a growing priority.\n\nFrom Oracle's perspective, the cost efficiency extends to our public cloud deployments. By consolidating workloads onto fewer systems, we reduce the demand for infrastructure while delivering the same or even better performance. This approach benefits not only Oracle but also our cloud partners and customers by optimizing return on investment (ROI) across the board.\n\nDQ: You mentioned Exadata X11M\u2019s cost efficiency. How does it help Oracle and its customers achieve a Return on Investment (ROI)?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAshish: That's an excellent question. Exadata X11M's cost efficiency stems from its ability to consolidate workloads and optimize resources. For Oracle's public cloud deployment, for instance, fewer systems are now required to support a larger number of customers. This optimization reduces the demand for power, space, and cooling in our data centers, which directly improves our ROI.\n\nFor our customers, the cost efficiency translates into faster productivity. Tasks like generating month-end or quarterly reports, which previously took hours, can now be completed in significantly less time. This boost in efficiency has ripple effects throughout the business ecosystem. Customers save on infrastructure costs while enhancing their operational capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, this efficiency extends to our cloud partners like AWS and Google Cloud, who can now offer Oracle solutions with reduced overhead. The result is a symbiotic relationship where Oracle, its partners, and its customers all benefit from streamlined operations and higher returns.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nDQ: How does Exadata address challenges like data silos, latency, and data security in a hybrid environment?\n\nAshish: Data silos and latency are common challenges for enterprises that have accumulated disparate systems over time. Exadata addresses these issues by consolidating all workloads into a unified, scalable architecture. This eliminates the need for multiple systems to interact through APIs, reducing latency and simplifying operations.\n\nThe architecture also includes Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technology, which allows ultra-fast data communication between servers and storage. This ensures that even latency-sensitive applications, such as financial transactions or flight reservations, perform seamlessly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhen it comes to security, Exadata offers robust features to protect data across hybrid environments. The platform adheres to stringent security protocols, ensuring data integrity whether it's stored on-premises, in a private cloud, or in a public cloud environment. Exadata's ability to scale elastically without downtime further ensures operational continuity and data protection.\n\nDQ: What are your observations on the Indian market's adoption of Exadata, and how does it cater to the unique needs of Indian enterprises?\n\nAshish: The Indian market is incredibly dynamic, with unique challenges and opportunities. The rapid digitization of the public and private sectors has led to a data explosion. Initiatives like UPI have showcased India's capability to scale digital solutions for a vast population. However, this scale also demands systems that are highly performant, scalable, and available.\n\nExadata is well-suited for the Indian market because it inherently supports these requirements. The platform's efficiency ensures that enterprises can handle massive workloads while keeping operational costs in check. Additionally, Exadata\u2019s ability to support seamless IT modernization makes it ideal for enterprises transitioning to cloud environments.\n\nFor Indian businesses, the flexibility of Exadata is a game-changer. Whether they choose to operate on-premises, adopt hybrid cloud models, or move to public cloud platforms, Exadata ensures that the transition is smooth, with no disruption to operations.\n\nDQ: Multi-cloud strategies are becoming a priority for organizations. What trends and challenges have you observed in this area?\n\nAshish: Multi-cloud strategies are no longer optional; they are essential for enterprises seeking flexibility and resilience.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nLike most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface \u2014 even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.\n\nThe mantle, a zone between our planet\u2019s thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended. But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.\n\nAmong the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous \u201csupercontinents\u201d buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates. One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean. Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet\u2019s mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn\u2019t as well-stirred by Earth\u2019s internal churning as once believed. And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature.\n\n\u201cThese findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,\u201d said Claire Richardson, a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.\n\n\u201cResolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,\u201d Richardson told CNN in an email. \u201cOpen questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what\u2019s really going on down there.\u201d\n\nClues revealed by waves\n\nResearchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet. When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth\u2019s deep interior.\n\nOver the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary. Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall. However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza, lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\n\n\u201cTheir origin and whether they are long-lived structures \u2014 it\u2019s widely debated,\u201d Talavera-Soza said.\n\nEarth maps in the top row show the positions of two buried supercontinents \u2014 also called large low shear velocity provinces or LLSVPs \u2014 and how they affect speed and attenuation, or damping, of seismic waves. The bottom row shows the same LLSVPs in a cross-section view of Earth. Utrecht University\n\nEarlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents. This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.\n\nVelocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said. But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions. Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were \u201ckind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss, a professor of structure and composition of Earth\u2019s deep interior at Utrecht University.\n\n\u201cThere was no information about that,\u201d Deuss said. \u201cWe only knew that seismic waves slowed down.\u201d\n\nIn the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones\u2019 composition and activity. They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.\n\nIn music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said. Examining the attenuation of the waves \u2014 along with changes in wave speed \u2014 could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs\u2019 makeup. The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.\n\nWave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics. Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave\u2019s energy.\n\nOlder than \u2018slab graveyards\u2019\n\nThe researchers' findings could transform the understanding of plate tectonics. Here, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake leaves devastation in the Noto region of Japan's Ishikawa prefecture in January 2024. Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOther studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle. Around them were \u201cslab graveyards\u201d of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said. They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.\n\nHowever, the new model showed that while seismic waves\u2019 velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn\u2019t lose much energy. By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.\n\nResearchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures. Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time. Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study. Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.\n\n\u201cOur study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. \u201cThis implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.\u201d\n\nThis discovery follows another recent revelation about even more \u201csunken worlds\u201d that contradict the notion of a blended mantle. Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth\u2019s subduction zones \u2014 regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other. But earlier this year, another team of scientists identified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents\u2019 interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.\n\n\u201cApparently, such zones in the Earth\u2019s mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,\u201d said Thomas Schouten, lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in a statement.\n\nThe model in the new study \u2014 the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle \u2014 will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth\u2019s surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.\n\n\u201cIt maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth\u2019s interior,\u201d she said.\n\nThe findings could transform researchers\u2019 understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth\u2019s core, Deuss said. Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.\n\n\u201cThese LLSVPs have been there for a long time \u2014 if they\u2019ve been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years. They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located. We can\u2019t prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,\u201d Deuss said.\n\n\u201cFrom this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.\u201d\n\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine."

            "article_content": "OVER the last four centuries, the physical sciences have undergone a metamorphosis marked by breath-taking discoveries and the evolution of sophisticated the\u00ad\u00ad\u00adories about the nature of reality. From Isaac Newton\u2019s ground-breaking work on matter and motion, to Albert Einstein\u2019s revolutionary ideas about energy and space-time, and finally to David Bohm\u2019s hypothesis linking quantum mechanics to consciousness, each era has expanded humanity\u2019s understanding of the universe. This transition paves the way for better understanding of the interface between science and spirituality.\n\nThe groundwork for classical mechanics was laid by Sir Isaac Newton. His matter hy\u00ad\u00adpothesis postulated that the universe was composed of indivisible discrete particles called atoms, governed by invariable laws of motion and gravity. Newton\u2019s landmark work, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathe\u00admatica, integrated the motion and gravitation laws into a collected framework. He provided a predictable and perceptible understanding of natural phenomena.\n\nFor example, his equations explained how stellar bodies move in elliptical orbits. Newton\u2019s reductionist ideas formulated matter as dormant and passive, subject only to external forces. While Newton\u2019s ideology successfully elaborated macroscopic phenomena, questions about the nature of light, electromagnetic waves, and the behaviour of matter at exceedingly small scales remained unanswered.\n\nAdvances in applied physics and the discovery of phenomena such as radioactivity exposed substantial gaps in Newtonian mechanics by the early 20th century. These challenges were consummated in the innovative work of Albert Einstein, who radically reshaped humanity\u2019s understanding of energy, matter, and space-time. Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity introduced the famous equation, e=mc2. This equation smashed the Newtonian assumption of matter as inert and invariable, showing that matter is a concentrated form of energy instead. His general theory of relativity further revisited gravity as the curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy.\n\nThe boundaries between physics, spirituality, and metaphysics are fluid.\n\nEinstein\u2019s ideas replaced the deterministic framework of Newton with a relativistic model, where time and space were no longer considered absolute but rather relative to the observer. This drastic change laid the groundwork for innovations such as GPS technology and nuclear energy.\n\nDavid Bohm introduced a radical outlook that sought to desegregate the perplexing aspects of quantum mechanics with broader inquiries about reality and consciousness in the mid-20th century. Influenced by Eastern philosophy and quantum physics, Bohm hypothesised that the universe is interconnected, operating as a holistic system at all levels. His implicate order theory suggested that the visible, tactile universe (the explicate order) emanates from an elementary, enwrapped reality (the implicate order). This idea addressed the ability of particles to exhibit wave-particle duality and distant interactions, where particles influence each other expeditiously across gigantic distances.\n\nBohm\u2019s work outstretched beyond physics into the domain of consciousness, which is synonymous with awareness of God. Bohm\u2019s implicate order theory explains the mind-matter connection, suggesting that consciousness plays a role in orchestrating reality thus influencing interdisciplinary research in the realms of neurosciences, philosophy, and spirituality. Bohm\u2019s approach signifies an important shift from reductionism to a more inclusive understanding of the universe and humanity. The science that was repulsive to an idea of religious belief thus began to embrace religious ideas culminating with the discovery of the Higgs boson or \u2018God particle\u2019, completing the stan\u00ad\u00ad-dard model of particle physics. This evolution is illustrated in the Quran as: Allah \u201cbuilt the universe with great might, and We are certainly expanding it\u201d (51:47).\n\nThe progress of physical science reflects humanity\u2019s ongoing desire to understand the true nature of reality. After these step-wise calculations, we are now beginning to realise that the boundaries between physics, philosophy, spirituality, and metaphysics are fluid and not as rigid as once thought. Each archetype has not only transfigured our understanding of the physical universe but also reshaped our scientific, philosophical, and sociocultural viewpoints.\n\nThe likes of Newton, Einstein and Bohm remind us that the pursuit of knowledge is an unending journey, challenging us to expand our horizons. As we advance from the early 17th-century concept of the nonexistence of God in science towards more recent awareness of consciousness, these ideas continue to evolve into new lines of inquiry thus paving the way to connect science with the ultimate Creator of the universe.\n\nThe writer is an assistant professor at West Virginia University School of Medicine.\n\nX: @mohsinfareed\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 31st, 2025"
