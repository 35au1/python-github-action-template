        "article_content": "Those curious of life outside our world can find fun Saturday at the Carbondalien Festival, which celebrates the milestone of a mysterious event in Carbondale\u2019s history.\n\nThe Carbondalien Festival marks the 50th anniversary of the infamous incident near Russell Park in Carbondale that many believe was a UFO crash landing on Nov. 9, 1974. The festival will be held Saturday at the park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nThe event is hosted by the Carbondale Arts Alliance and will have vendors, food trucks, speakers, art and live music.\n\nNicole Curtis, the Carbondalien Festival\u2019s organizer, \u201cCarbondalien-in-Chief\u201d and co-owner of the City Line Shop Cafe in Carbondale, was inspired to start the festival as an alien art walk after seeing how art helped save other nearby small towns.\n\nMany townspeople are not aware of the UFO event since many did not want to discuss it for fear of being ridiculed. There were many sightings of the UFO that allegedly crashed from around the county, from the Scranton area to Carbondale, according to Curtis.\n\nWhat occurred 50 years ago is an \u201camazing incredible thing that not many people know about that should be celebrated and not be ashamed about,\u201d said Curtis. On that day, \u201csomething glowed in the water for nine hours and left on a flatbed truck,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the newspaper archives, the legend began on Nov. 9, 1974, when three teenage boys alerted police after witnessing a \u201cred, whirring ball\u201d fall from the sky and into a mine pond. The incident drew police, military and the curious to the city and concluded with a dive team pulling a battery-powered mine lantern from the pond.\n\nCurtis started planning for the Carbondalien Festival a year ago by looking for an artist to design an alien and reached out to Jennifer Forgione, known as JFo, studio artist of JFo Generation in Spring Brook Twp.\n\nForgione\u2019s mother was an eyewitness to the UFO while observing the sky at her home in Dunmore. This synchronistic event is \u201cwhy I am so passionate about it and it is a very good thing,\u201d said Forgione, who is excited to participate in the festival linked to her mother\u2019s UFO sighting.\n\nThose wanting to know about the legend can watch the theatrical performance, \u201cThe Russel Park Experience,\u201d presented in partnership with the Lackawanna Historical Society. The performance immerses the audience as a member of the press at the crash site trying to get the facts of what happened. Performances will take place at Russell Park at 11:45 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m.\n\nThe festival is a \u201cgreat opportunity to meet interesting people and learn new things,\u201d as well as a place to meet \u201clike-minded people in the cryptid and UFO world,\u201d said Curtis.\n\nFestivalgoers can learn more about UFO topics at the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite. Speakers include: James Krug with \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers & How to Become a MUFON Investigator,\u201d Bill Weber with \u201cUFO Sightings and Cover Ups,\u201d Tim Renner with \u201cThe 1920\u2019s Bigfoot Flap in Pennsylvania\u201d and Alan B. Smith with \u201cExposing UFO Debunkers.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Carbondalien Festival will have a ticketed after-party event at the ballroom of the Hotel Anthracite with a cocktail hour, dinner and presentation of \u201cWorld of the Weird\u201d by Heather Taddy, known as the team documentarian on A&E\u2019s hit television series \u201cParanormal State,\u201d from 6 to 8:30 p.m.\n\nThroughout the city, 34 local businesses are hosting a scavenger hunt with 7-foot-tall wooden aliens unique to each location. Visitors can vote for their favorite design on the festival\u2019s website.\n\nOther activities include a free Alien Swim at the Carbondale YMCA, and an Alien Storytime and Craft, Alien Teen Bingo and Extraterrestrial Film Festival at the Carbondale Public Library.\n\nAccording to Forgione, the more people who get excited about the festival, the less people will be afraid of aliens.\n\n\u201cYou see a cute little heinie on the alien and smile and laugh,\u201d Forgione said of her artwork. Forgione will be selling handmade 7-foot-tall, 4-foot-tall and 2-foot-tall wooden aliens at the event, along with alien ornaments.\n\nCurtis said the event is to keep \u201can openness to what the story could be.\u201d This gives people an opportunity to not argue over the story, but ponder the possibilities.\n\n\u201cMany feel ostracized talking and sharing their story,\u201d said Forgione. \u201cThere might be so many stories that people are afraid to tell.\u201d\n\nAn eyewitness who wishes to remain anonymous and was first on the scene has donated stacks of photos, business cards of reporters who came to town and typed-up reports about the event to the Lackawanna Historical Society, according to Curtis.\n\nCurtis hopes the Carbondalien Festival helps to build tourism for the town by getting people to see what the town has to offer. She wants the Carbondalien Festival to evolve into an annual event.\n\nThose attending the event will find \u201can escape from a regular day and have a magical one-of-a-kind experience,\u201d said Forgione.\n\nFor more information about the Carbondalien Festival and to purchase tickets for the after-party, go to carbondalienfestival.com.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Carbondalien Festival\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: Russell Park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown.\n\nEvents: The immersive \u201cThe Russel Park Experience\u201d at the park, the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite, a citywide scavenger hunt, alien-themed activities at the Carbondale Public Library and more.

        "article_content": "Many of the reported cases of alleged alien encounters, flying saucers, or abductions take place in remote locations, far from the eyes and cameras of almost anyone, or in conditions that make it difficult to see anything clearly. For those who fabricate such experiences, it is a necessary alibi. The case of New Yorker Linda Napolitano, a housewife of Italian descent who said she was abducted by aliens in 1989, generated huge media coverage for exactly the opposite reason: she claimed that a UFO had taken her from her bedroom by means of a tractor beam in the early hours of the morning, in the middle of Manhattan.\n\nTogether with researcher Budd Hopkins, one of the most famous figures in ufology, she brought 23 witnesses to the table who supported her story and said they had seen her fly over the Brooklyn Bridge. The family not only confirmed the veracity of her experiences, but also declared themselves victims of interventions from outer space. And they all stand firm, to the point that Napolitano, who is now 77 years old, has just sued Netflix over a documentary that casts serious doubts on what some media dubbed \u201cthe abduction of the century.\u201d\n\nThe three-episode series, The Manhattan Alien Abduction, was written by Linda Napolitano herself and premiered in the U.S. on October 30, just in time for Halloween. It certainly has terrifying elements, not so much in the dramatizations of the abduction itself, but testimonies such as that of her son, who appears with his face obscured and claims to have been in psychological treatment for years over the trauma of alien visits of which he, who experienced the coverage of the case as a child, is entirely convinced. However, there is another woman who manages to displace Napolitano from the center of the documentary: Carol Rainey, Hopkins\u2019 ex-wife and a notable skeptic of her former husband\u2019s work, especially on the Manhattan case. The basis of the complaint against Netflix is that the participation of Rainey, who died in 2023, is much greater than the aggrieved party expected. Napolitano says she was assured Rainey would make only one appearance, but she is, by all accounts, the co-star.\n\nThe apartment block in Manhattan where Linda Napolitano was allegedly abducted by aliens in 1989. General (\u00a92005 Credit:TopFoto/Fortean)\n\nAs such, The Manhattan Alien Abduction is much more interesting than a mere reconstruction of a 35-year-old UFO file. Its unexpected focus on Rainey allows us to access another story, that of someone who, out of respect for the man she had once loved, for the credibility and objectivity she once had, made the tough decision to disavow him in a shattering publication that questioned his rigor and methodology. \u201cI saw that I was losing objectivity. I loved Budd. He seemed to me to have complete integrity. Completely honest. But if it was a hoax, I needed to know if my husband was complicit,\u201d Rainey states in the documentary. Peter Robbins, Hopkins\u2019 assistant and friend, who blames Rainey for Hopkins\u2019 book Witnessed: The True Story Of The Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions (1996) not being republished or made into a film adaptation, doesn\u2019t see it that way: \u201cHer goal in life was to destroy this man and destroy his reputation.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a harpy,\u201d Napolitano goes so far as to say on camera.\n\nThe housewife\u2019s story contained bizarre elements that went beyond the 1989 abduction. A year later, Napolitano alerted Hopkins that she was being harassed by two men named Dan and Richard, who had witnessed the event from an official car in which they were transporting none other than then-Secretary General of the United Nations Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar. Hopkins, who never saw them himself, gave credence to the letters she received signed in their name and that of the diplomat. According to Napolitano, the men kidnapped her and Dan, who was madly in love with her, ended up in a psychiatric hospital. She also underwent an X-ray test to prove that a lump in her nose was the result of an alien graft. The X-ray revealed that it did appear to house a small cylindrical object, but when she later agreed to undergo surgery to remove it, the object never appeared.\n\nI want to believe\n\nSociologist, writer and editor Pablo Vergel, a contributor to Spanish TV show Cuarto Milenio, which covers mysteries and enigmas, spoke to Napolitano several years ago via Facebook. His intention was to have her participate in a report on the show, although he was unable to get her to appear in front of the cameras. Vergel acknowledges to EL PA\u00cdS that it is \u201ca very problematic case,\u201d which owes its popularity to the context and \u201cthe series of incredible twists and turns that followed, a real soap opera, thanks to which it had a lot of coverage in the tabloid press [...] Iconically, this UFO that lifts someone from their apartment with a ray, takes them out and crosses the most famous skyline in the world, over the Brooklyn Bridge, cannot be more powerful,\u201d he says. In 2021, Vergel published in Spain a book by Budd Hopkins, Intruders, originally from 1987 and one of the key titles in the abduction phenomenon in the United States.\n\nWhitley Strieber photographed in 2016. David Livingston (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cBudd Hopkins is part of the triad of researchers who created the great wave of abductions in the United States, almost a sociological phenomenon, along with Whitley Strieber and John E. Mack,\u201d explains the editor. \u201cHe did have a certain courage; he created support groups for people who said they had been abducted, he established mechanisms and protocols\u2026 Whitley Strieber, the famous author of Communion (1987), turned to Budd Hopkins and said in his book that he helped him a lot in managing his emotional crisis after the traumatic experience he had [his alleged encounter with extraterrestrials]. But at a certain point he began to act like a devotee, like an absolute believer who could not conceive of any alternative explanation. Many people have accused him of having been an evangelist of the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial hypothesis, rather than of investigating it. He abused hypnosis a lot. If you read his books, hypnosis does not follow methodological controls, it leaves suggestion very open. There is even the possibility of ending up implanting memories in the person. Budd Hopkins \u2014 and I say this as his editor \u2014 seems to me to be an interesting author, but also very questionable.\u201d\n\nThe sociologist refers to a study of the Napolitano case published in 1993 by parapsychologist George P. Hansen, together with Joseph J. Stefula and Richard D. Butler, who was critical of Hopkins for not verifying the \u201cvery close\u201d relationship between the housewife and the professional who performed the X-ray test, or the independence of the supposed 23 witnesses to the phenomenon. Among the testimonies that Hopkins had accepted as valid was that of a woman who said she had not been able to see clearly because of the fog \u2014 on a morning when such weather conditions did not occur \u2014 or that of another who, excusing herself on the grounds of her fear, did not close the curtains at her window that night. Hansen and his colleagues found as many as 16 parallels between Napolitano\u2019s story and Garfield Reeves-Stevens\u2019 1989 science fiction novel Nighteyes. They also questioned Hopkins\u2019 honesty, noting that the alleged abductee said he had promised her half the profits from his book about her case.\n\nRobbins, the colleague who backs Hopkins in The Manhattan Alien Abduction, brings up in his statements that Rainey, the researcher\u2019s ex-wife, grew up in a fundamentalist Christian family belonging to the Plymouth Brethren, to suggest that she opposed the extraterrestrial hypothesis because of her religion. Rainey argues in the documentary that, precisely, her experience with Hopkins reopened a wound from the past, when she was estranged from her entire family for questioning the faith: \u201cHis dogma was as radical as my father\u2019s. They both never doubted and seemed to be in possession of the truth. I could not tolerate what he was doing to very vulnerable people,\u201d Rainey said in reference to Hopkins\u2019 hypnosis sessions with people convinced they were being visited by extraterrestrials.\n\nNapolitano, who is said in the series to have had a frustrated vocation as a music star, has called the late Rainey \u201cresentful and alcoholic\u201d in her lawsuit, as well as damaging to her reputation. Nevertheless, The Manhattan Alien Abduction is conciliatory to anyone who really wants to believe her story. Through the theme of faith, the documentary does allow us to glimpse that, among the scholars or mere lovers of the UFO phenomenon, there are those who, with more or less rigor, try to collate their research, and those who only seek to confirm their own beliefs.\n\nDepending on your preferences, the Brooklyn Bridge story generated a previous documentary that completely takes the authenticity of the matter for granted: Linda Napolitano: The Alien Abduction of the Century (2022). Although Napolitano does not participate in it, we are told, based on the thesis of a certain Corrado Malanga, an Italian researcher of the holographic universe, that humans are the most spiritually developed creatures in the universe and that aliens abduct us to imprint their memories in our unconscious, in order to become immortal with our soul.

        "article_content": "Microsoft\u2019s been pretty crafty with integrating AI in multiple Windows 11 native apps. Paint got an AI overhaul last year when it debuted with \u201cCocreator, an AI-powered image generation feature.\n\nThe company later rebranded the feature to \u201cImage Creator\u201d and reserved the Cocreator feature for Copilot+ PCs. Now, it is testing Generative Erase and Fill features in the Insider channel.\n\nThe names are self-explanatory. Generative Fill uses AI models to add elements to the existing image. So, you can select an image area and enter a simple prompt like \u201cadd a cat,\u201d and it\u2019ll do that for you.\n\nSimilarly, the Generative Erase detects the highlighted area, wipes it, and blends it with the background colors, like there wasn\u2019t anything there.\n\nThere isn\u2019t any submenu for Generative Fill and Erase. These options appear after selecting the image area with the selection tool.\n\nWe installed the latest version of Paint that contains both these features, aka version 11.2410.28.0, but remember the new experience is only for Windows 11 Canary and Dev Insiders. Generative Fill is only available and works on Copilot+ Insider PCs, while the Erase feature works on every machinein the Insider Program.\n\nGenerative Fill and Erase AI features in MS Paint\n\nDue to the lack of a Copilot+ PC, we could only test the Generative Erase feature on our AMD hardware. We were happy with the overall performance as it didn\u2019t struggle much while removing an object from the image.\n\nThe feature works without the internet, so you don\u2019t have to worry about exhausting daily credits like the Image Cocreator feature. Generative Fill must also work on the same idea because Copilot+ PC has local AI models that can create AI images quickly.\n\nNote that the Erase feature isn\u2019t something new. The Photos app has had it for quite some time, and the feature underwent multiple name rebrandings before Microsoft settled on \u201cGenerative Erase.\u201d\n\nWe like this approach as the name is less confusing, and having similar names for identical features is helpful for end users.\n\nHow to use Paint AI\u2019s Generative Fill and Erase features in Windows 11\n\nAs mentioned above, the selection tool is the entry point to invoke both these features. Click on the Selection Tool and choose the \u201cRectangle\u201d or \u201cFree-form\u201d option. Then, drag the cursor to select a portion of the image.\n\nYou\u2019ll see the \u201cFill\u201d and \u201cErase\u201d icons along with the \u201cBackground Remover\u201d icon. Click on the Fill icon and describe the element you want to add to the image. Then, click the Create button to generate the image with locally stored AI models.\n\nIf you\u2019re satisfied, click on the Keep option to finalize the image. Otherwise, click the retry icon to generate the image again and experiment with designs.\n\nNext, we tried the Generative Erase option, which doesn\u2019t need a Copilot+ PC to work. We selected a portion of the image and clicked on the Erase icon. It worked its AI magic and removed the Insider build watermark in the image with the background.\n\nYou can also use it with the Eraser tool. Select the Eraser tool from the menu bar, and you\u2019ll see the same Erase icon on the left side.\n\nDrag the slider to adjust the brush size and then drag it to highlight the area. It\u2019ll automatically wipe and blend the image. Hit Apply to finalize the changes.\n\nWhen will both these features arrive?\n\nGenerative Fill will undergo more tests in the Insider channel before it arrives in the stable version. Initially, it will be limited to Copilot+ Snapdragon PCs, but Microsoft plans to bring it to more AI PCs from Intel and AMD.\n\nYou don\u2019t really need to wait for Generative Erase, as it\u2019s already available in the Windows Photos app since Windows 11 23H2.\n\nThe Paint version won\u2019t be coming soon, so use the Photos app if you have something urgent to remove from a photo."

        "article_content": "Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nGoogle\u2019s reputation for launching overlapping apps is well-earned \u2014 just look at the confusion between Hangouts, Meet, and Chat. But after years of throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks, the search giant might finally be onto something with its latest foray in the note-taking genre. Yes, it integrates Gemini (because what doesn\u2019t these days?), but it\u2019s done in a genuinely useful and tasteful way. Dubbed NotebookLM, it feels like Google\u2019s long-overdue answer to the likes of OneNote and Notion. But dig a little deeper and you\u2019ll find that this relatively unknown Google app has one killer feature that deserves your attention.\n\nNotebookLM: Google\u2019s best-kept secret? NotebookLM is Google\u2019s latest attempt at a note organization app that allows you to pool information from various sources into one central \u201cnotebook\u201d. When you first open the app, you\u2019ll be prompted to import information from various sources such as your own documents from Google Drive, articles from any URL on the internet, YouTube videos, PDF files, and even audio clips in the MP3 format.\n\nIf you\u2019re a college student working on a chapter of organic chemistry, for example, you could add your class notes, relevant research papers, instructional videos from YouTube, and recorded audio from past lectures. NotebookLM then pools all of this content into one place. There\u2019s little AI involved so far, which is a good thing \u2014 I would not want an AI to do all of the research for me and potentially poison my notes with hallucinations.\n\nWith everything consolidated, though, NotebookLM\u2019s namesake finally starts to make sense. Under the hood, the app relies on Google\u2019s largest language model, Gemini 1.5 Pro, which can hold a context of two million tokens. This allows the app to analyze hundreds of pages\u2019 worth of text to create new content like AI-generated briefing docs, timelines, and study guides. The best part? You don\u2019t need to pay $20 per month for Gemini Advanced to use NotebookLM.\n\nNotebookLM\u2019s AI-generated content relies exclusively on your uploaded references, so it\u2019s as grounded as it gets. And as Google Lab\u2019s editorial director showcases in the following tweet, the AI can understand just about any kind of source material \u2014 including handwritten notes.\n\nNotebookLM is rather barebones compared to full-fledged platforms like Notion or OneNote, but it does offer a bulletin-board style interface where you can pin AI-generated content or your own manually-typed notes. This works a lot better than a chat interface where you\u2019d need to endlessly scroll and hunt down relevant responses. That said, NotebookLM also offers a chat interface with inline citations that link to not just individual source documents but also the exact page where it found the information in question.\n\nA notebook in NotebookLM Inline citations\n\nWhile the features I\u2019ve mentioned so far seem mildly useful, they won\u2019t convince you or most people to try using NotebookLM. Luckily, there\u2019s one area where NotebookLM will likely blow you away: its Audio Overviews feature.\n\nAn Audio Overview turns all of your notes and sources into a podcast, complete with two human-sounding hosts who go back and forth over the contents of your notebook. I\u2019m not talking about a simple text-to-speech narration \u2014 an Audio Overview effectively emulates dynamic, human-like conversation. I was skeptical when I first heard about this feature, but my opinion quickly changed when the AI voices evoked emotions like surprise, curiosity, and frustration when debating complex points between themselves.\n\nAudio Overviews and why I\u2019m sold on NotebookLM\n\nEven though I\u2019m not a college student or marketing professional who needs to digest reams upon reams of notes, I see immense value in NotebookLM on a nearly daily basis. Take the recent Android 15 update, for example, which contained dozens of changes.\n\nRather than reading through the changelog, I added in Google\u2019s official blog post as well as our extensive coverage of Android 15\u2019s features to a new notebook. At this point, I could ask the AI to summarize the update but I opted to generate an Audio Overview instead. The processing for the latter takes a few minutes, but it\u2019s a short wait all things considered. Here\u2019s the final result:\n\nIn this particular instance, the podcast starts a bit abruptly but it quickly gains momentum. I specifically prompted the AI to talk about user-facing Android 15 features before moving to less impactful ones. The hosts followed this instruction perfectly, listing some of the headlining features and how they work. But notice how throughout the podcast, the AI voices don\u2019t just wait for their turn but also encourage, agreee, or even disagree with the other host. The clip is filled with instances of \u201cmm-hmm,\u201d \u201coh, yes,\u201d deep breaths, and even awkward laughter. Moments like these make you feel like you\u2019re listening to a natural human conversation instead of a synthetic AI creation.\n\nNotebookLM's podcasts sound so human that I often forget an AI was ever involved.\n\nAnd therein lies the beauty of this feature. Listening to a podcast is not the fastest way to absorb information, but most of us can\u2019t stomach reading through pages of boring documentation or poorly-organized notes either.\n\nIn my experience, the AI Overview feature strikes a good balance between speed and engagement \u2014 you get an immersive listening experience that feels like you\u2019re absorbing knowledge passively, almost like you\u2019re tuning in to a real conversation between two experts. I can also listen to the podcast while doing a chore, driving, or walking outdoors. For this reason, NotebookLM might be one of Google\u2019s most useful AI creations to date, surpassing even Gemini Live for me.\n\nDo I think that NotebookLM and its podcast feature is perfect? No, and the above clip proves it \u2014 for example, the hosts will sometimes reference a particular talking point more than once during the same podcast. I also wish the voices weren\u2019t always so cheerful and excited all the time. In fact, I would like to see more customization options that influence the final result in general. But even as-is, I think NotebookLM is one of the rare Google products to show serious potential in recent memory and I highly recommend trying it out for yourself.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

        "article_content": "Glenn Fogel recognizes that generative AI is still young \u2014 and full of bugs \u2014 but there's no time to experiment like the present.\n\nSelect a question above or ask something else\n\nBooking Holdings is actively integrating generative AI into its five major brands\u2014Booking.com, Priceline, Kayak, Agoda, and OpenTable\u2014to enhance both consumer-facing and internal tools. These efforts include AI-powered trip planners and chatbots at Booking.com, voicebot integration at Priceline and OpenTable, and automated product development at Agoda. Each brand is leveraging AI to improve operational efficiency, customer service, and product offerings, while still in the early stages of exploring AI's full potential in the travel sector.\n\nBooking Holdings has a lot of AI experiments in the works.\n\nAll five of the travel giant\u2019s consumer brands \u2014 Booking.com, Priceline, Kayak, Agoda, and OpenTable \u2014 now have various consumer or internal tools powered by generative AI. That means the company can test multiple tools to see which work best.\n\nGlenn Fogel, president and CEO of Booking Holdings, outlined the brand\u2019s AI projects and shared updates during a call with investors last week.\n\n\u201cWe know we are still in the very early days of GenAI and we have much more to learn about consumers, how they ultimately want to interact with this new technology,\u201d Fogel said during the call.\n\n\u201cOver time, as we further incorporate this technology, we expect to see benefits in travel and partner acquisition, retention and satisfaction. In addition, we expect it to improve operational efficiency, which will contribute to a deceleration of our fixed expense growth in the future.\u201d\n\nBooking.com\n\nBooking.com released the first version of its AI trip planner in June 2023, which Fogel said has had millions of interactions with customers that are leading to new applications of generative AI. He said that\u2019s still a very small proportion of the brand\u2019s engagement with customers.\n\nThe app\u2019s trip planner last week got an update that allows users to ask the chatbot property-specific questions. And the property search results page got a tool that allows users to automatically check amenity filters using natural language, meant to remove the need for manual filtering.\n\nFogel said the company is working on some tools for hotel clients, as well. That includes a hotel-facing tool to help properties write responses to inquiries from travelers, which he said has led to an increase in response rate. Booking.com is testing a chatbot to help new clients, starting with short-term rentals, answer questions during the onboarding process and accelerate sign-ups.\n\nThe company is also working to incorporate generative AI into its customer service operations.\n\n\u201cInitial testing shows meaningful improvements in topic detection in Booking.com\u2019s customer help center as well as customer service agent case summarization. Booking.com is still early in this journey and sees meaningful opportunities in improving customer service and driving greater efficiency by leveraging AI in the future,\u201d Fogel said.\n\nPriceline\n\nPriceline last month was the first travel company to release a voicebot based on the newest voice tech from OpenAI.\n\nThe Connecticut-based online travel agency first released the AI chatbot Penny in June 2023. It became Penny Voice with the update, able to engage in verbal conversations with travelers to help with hotel search and managing bookings.\n\n\u201cAs Priceline continues to enhance this offering, we envision that Penny will be able to anticipate needs based on preferences and past interaction and then respond in a real-time voice. While there has been great progress in the development of Penny over the last year, Priceline is focused on further enhancing Penny over time by leveraging their valuable learnings so far,\u201d Fogel said.\n\nAgoda\n\nFogel said that generative AI has been implemented for more than 120 uses across customer service, software development, content generation, product, finance and human resources at Agoda.\n\nHe said the Singapore-based online travel agency is focused on using generative AI to automate product development.\n\n\u201cThis is leading to an increase in the share of code written by AI as well as measurable improvements in productivity per developer and development time,\u201d he said.\n\nAgoda CEO Omri Morgenshtern has said in the past that he\u2019s skeptical about the use of generative AI in trip-planning tools.\n\nOpenTable\n\nOpenTable, the San Francisco-based restaurant reservation app, in September added an AI voicebot meant to help client restaurants answer their phones.\n\nThe voicebot is able to take calls from restaurant guests to take and manage reservations, answer questions, and note dietary restrictions, then automatically saving the information to the OpenTable reservation.\n\nThe voicebot comes from the startup PolyAI, which raised $50 million in May.\n\nOpenTable also in September announced a partnership with Salesforce. Its Agentforce platform is meant to help OpenTable agents automate certain customer service requests. The platform handles routine tasks like reservation changes and loyalty point redemptions, meant to help agents focus on more complex situations.\n\nKayak\n\nKayak in March launched Ask Kayak, an AI trip planning tool that the company is still piloting.\n\nAt the same time, the Connecticut-based metasearch engine also launched a tool called PriceCheck. It\u2019s a price comparison tool that allows travelers to upload a screenshot of a flight itinerary, which Kayak then checks against many different sites to determine if there is a better price available.\n\nKayak Chief Scientist Matthias Keller earlier this year discussed several other ways that the company is using AI. That includes multiple experiments for improving internal productivity. And Kayak has a connection with Microsoft Copilot, allowing users of the Bing search engine users to get real-time flight information from Kayak within AI-generated results."

        "article_content": "Britain's most haunted towns have been revealed with the spookiest place in the country named based on the number of ghost sightings.\n\nThe research, which analysed reported paranormal sightings and haunted locations across the country, offers ghost hunters and thrill-seekers a guide to the spookiest locations. The study ranked counties and local authorities based on reports of paranormal activity per square mile, creating a \"paranormal activity score\" to determine the most supernaturally dense areas in the UK. This approach highlights where ghostly encounters are most concentrated.\n\nSo which town is officially the most haunted with a Paranormal Activity Score of 100 and 43 reported paranormal activities and haunted locations all concentrated in just 15 square miles? The would be Ipswich. The Ancient House is known for ghostly monk sightings and mysterious footsteps, while Christchurch Mansion is home to the ghost of a young Victorian maid. The Ipswich Museum, with reported sightings of a phantom Edwardian lady, offers a cultural twist to ghostly encounters.\n\nAlex Wilson, CEO and founder of Affordable Urns, said: \"Our research reveals some exciting destinations for paranormal enthusiasts. The high concentration of reported hauntings in these areas speaks to the rich history and enduring legends of the UK. While we encourage people to explore these fascinating locations, we also urge visitors to approach them with respect and caution. Many of these sites have historical significance and may have restricted access. Always ensure you have proper permission before visiting and follow all safety guidelines.

Even, the Ipswich Museum chills visitors with a phantom Edwardian lady stalking its halls.\n\n2. Lincoln\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nLincoln emerges as a close second on the spooky scale, ranking high with a Paranormal Activity Score of 82.20. The city's 14 square miles shudder with 33 reports of hauntings and ghost sightings. Lincoln Castle's walls echo with the cries of a woman executed after being accused of witchcraft. The Magna Carta pub buzzes with stories of a ghostly monk and a cavalier. And, the imposing Lincoln Cathedral's Gothic setting comes with many tales of the spiritual realm, including the \"Swinging Monk\".\n\n3. Cambridge\n\nImage: Cambridge News) Cambridge News)\n\nIn third place, Cambridge lurks with a ghastly score of 74.09. Paranormal enthusiasts have recorded 34 unsettling spiritual occurrences across the city's 16 square miles. Amongst Cambridge's spooky highlights are Corpus Christi College, haunted by the apparition of former master Dr. Butts, while Peterhouse College hosts the ghost of Francis Dawes. Plus, seekers of supernatural thrills can visit the Leper Chapel, where echoes of its tragic past manifest through spiritual sightings of its departed lepers.\n\n4. Exeter\n\nImage: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\n\n\n\nExeter, with a score of 65.85 and 34 reports of paranormal activity across its 18 square miles comes in fourth place.

        "article_content": "Those curious of life outside our world can find fun Saturday at the Carbondalien Festival, which celebrates the milestone of a mysterious event in Carbondale\u2019s history.\n\nThe Carbondalien Festival marks the 50th anniversary of the infamous incident near Russell Park in Carbondale that many believe was a UFO crash landing on Nov. 9, 1974. The festival will be held Saturday at the park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nThe event is hosted by the Carbondale Arts Alliance and will have vendors, food trucks, speakers, art and live music.\n\nNicole Curtis, the Carbondalien Festival\u2019s organizer, \u201cCarbondalien-in-Chief\u201d and co-owner of the City Line Shop Cafe in Carbondale, was inspired to start the festival as an alien art walk after seeing how art helped save other nearby small towns.\n\nMany townspeople are not aware of the UFO event since many did not want to discuss it for fear of being ridiculed. There were many sightings of the UFO that allegedly crashed from around the county, from the Scranton area to Carbondale, according to Curtis.\n\nWhat occurred 50 years ago is an \u201camazing incredible thing that not many people know about that should be celebrated and not be ashamed about,\u201d said Curtis. On that day, \u201csomething glowed in the water for nine hours and left on a flatbed truck,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the newspaper archives, the legend began on Nov. 9, 1974, when three teenage boys alerted police after witnessing a \u201cred, whirring ball\u201d fall from the sky and into a mine pond. The incident drew police, military and the curious to the city and concluded with a dive team pulling a battery-powered mine lantern from the pond.\n\nCurtis started planning for the Carbondalien Festival a year ago by looking for an artist to design an alien and reached out to Jennifer Forgione, known as JFo, studio artist of JFo Generation in Spring Brook Twp.\n\nForgione\u2019s mother was an eyewitness to the UFO while observing the sky at her home in Dunmore. This synchronistic event is \u201cwhy I am so passionate about it and it is a very good thing,\u201d said Forgione, who is excited to participate in the festival linked to her mother\u2019s UFO sighting.\n\nThose wanting to know about the legend can watch the theatrical performance, \u201cThe Russel Park Experience,\u201d presented in partnership with the Lackawanna Historical Society. The performance immerses the audience as a member of the press at the crash site trying to get the facts of what happened. Performances will take place at Russell Park at 11:45 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m.\n\nThe festival is a \u201cgreat opportunity to meet interesting people and learn new things,\u201d as well as a place to meet \u201clike-minded people in the cryptid and UFO world,\u201d said Curtis.\n\nFestivalgoers can learn more about UFO topics at the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite. Speakers include: James Krug with \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers & How to Become a MUFON Investigator,\u201d Bill Weber with \u201cUFO Sightings and Cover Ups,\u201d Tim Renner with \u201cThe 1920\u2019s Bigfoot Flap in Pennsylvania\u201d and Alan B. Smith with \u201cExposing UFO Debunkers.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Carbondalien Festival will have a ticketed after-party event at the ballroom of the Hotel Anthracite with a cocktail hour, dinner and presentation of \u201cWorld of the Weird\u201d by Heather Taddy, known as the team documentarian on A&E\u2019s hit television series \u201cParanormal State,\u201d from 6 to 8:30 p.m.\n\nThroughout the city, 34 local businesses are hosting a scavenger hunt with 7-foot-tall wooden aliens unique to each location. Visitors can vote for their favorite design on the festival\u2019s website.\n\nOther activities include a free Alien Swim at the Carbondale YMCA, and an Alien Storytime and Craft, Alien Teen Bingo and Extraterrestrial Film Festival at the Carbondale Public Library.\n\nAccording to Forgione, the more people who get excited about the festival, the less people will be afraid of aliens.\n\n\u201cYou see a cute little heinie on the alien and smile and laugh,\u201d Forgione said of her artwork. Forgione will be selling handmade 7-foot-tall, 4-foot-tall and 2-foot-tall wooden aliens at the event, along with alien ornaments.\n\nCurtis said the event is to keep \u201can openness to what the story could be.\u201d This gives people an opportunity to not argue over the story, but ponder the possibilities.\n\n\u201cMany feel ostracized talking and sharing their story,\u201d said Forgione. \u201cThere might be so many stories that people are afraid to tell.\u201d\n\nAn eyewitness who wishes to remain anonymous and was first on the scene has donated stacks of photos, business cards of reporters who came to town and typed-up reports about the event to the Lackawanna Historical Society, according to Curtis.\n\nCurtis hopes the Carbondalien Festival helps to build tourism for the town by getting people to see what the town has to offer. She wants the Carbondalien Festival to evolve into an annual event.\n\nThose attending the event will find \u201can escape from a regular day and have a magical one-of-a-kind experience,\u201d said Forgione.\n\nFor more information about the Carbondalien Festival and to purchase tickets for the after-party, go to carbondalienfestival.com.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Carbondalien Festival\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: Russell Park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown.\n\nEvents: The immersive \u201cThe Russel Park Experience\u201d at the park, the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite, a citywide scavenger hunt, alien-themed activities at the Carbondale Public Library and more.

We want it to be mysterious,\u2019 \u201d Matt Duffer explained.\n\n\u201cBut they were like, \u2018Yeah, but can you write it down?\u2019 And so we wrote it all down.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ross said the final season would finally tie up all loose ends.\n\n\u201cThe last remaining questions that are answered in that document, we\u2019ve punted a couple of those to have some big reveals in Season 5,\u201d said Ross Duffer during Geeked Week in June 2022. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really going to affect what Season 5 is about.\u201d\n\nStranger Things 5 will be released in 2025."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nThe prognostic application of metabolic signature and adjacent localization of cancer cells with metabolic and proliferative states support the role of metabolic state in tumor progression. Credit: Cancer Discovery (2024). DOI: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-24-0187\n\nA new study led by University of Cincinnati Cancer Center researchers details how the accumulation of copper helps clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)\u2014the most common kidney cancer\u2014grow and advance in stage. The findings were published in Cancer Discovery.\n\nCopper is an essential trace element that is required to produce energy in the body and allows humans to live in an oxygen-containing atmosphere.\n\nThe Cancer Center's Maria Czyzyk-Krzeska, MD, Ph.D., lead author of the research, said that increased accumulation of copper is associated with worse outcomes for patients with ccRCC. Using a multidisciplinary approach, Czyzyk-Krzeska and her colleagues established that ccRCC cells accumulate more copper as they advance from stage 1 toward metastatic disease.\n\nThe team found high copper levels help cancer cells make more of a special enzyme that boosts their energy and growth. At the same time, sugar (glucose) helps create a protective molecule called glutathione. This molecule clears out toxins and reduces the harmful effects of copper, giving cancer cells an extra survival boost.\n\n\"In other words, copper induces an orchestrated, multilevel adaptation of cancer cells that promotes tumor growth,\" said Czyzyk-Krzeska, professor in the Department of Cancer Biology in UC's College of Medicine. \"It causes a change in the cell's metabolic state.\"\n\nUsing single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, the team discovered that ccRCC tumors have metabolic \"hot spots\" with enriched copper-dependent energy production. These hot spots are in proximity to other tumor cells that have proliferative features essential for tumor growth.\n\n\"That is something that is very important because it can allow us to hypothesize that those proliferative cells are supported by the cells that are active metabolically,\" Czyzyk-Krzeska said. \"We can also speculate that some of these metabolically active cells eventually progress to become more proliferative.\"\n\nNext steps\n\nCzyzyk-Krzeska emphasized that even though it is now better understood how copper helps ccRCC cells grow, it is still unknown exactly what is causing copper to accumulate in these tumors in the first place.\n\nExperts hypothesize the copper accumulation can result from environmental exposures such as tobacco smoking, e-cigarette use or exposure to wildfire smoke that is heavy in copper. Veterans are known to be at a higher risk for kidney cancer, and exposure to copper in ammunition or at shooting ranges may also be a contributing factor. However, copper uptake by cancer cells can also be caused by mechanisms intrinsic to the tumors.\n\nMoving forward, Czyzyk-Krzeska said the research is still in experimental phases, but the knowledge gained has identified potential vulnerabilities that can be targeted with new treatments. These treatments could look like co-therapies that target both metabolic and proliferative cells, she noted.\n\nLevels of copper in patient specimens could also be used as a biomarker to predict how aggressive the cancer is or whether it is likely to recur after initial surgery.\n\nIn addition to the Czyzyk-Krzeska lab's molecular biology work, Julio Landero Figueroa, Ph.D., of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, conducted metallomic analytical chemistry to determine the copper levels in human, animal and cell line models. Jarek Meller, Ph.D., professor in UC's Department of Biostatistics, Health Informatics and Data Science in the College of Medicine, supervised and conducted the bioinformatics portion of the research.\n\n\"It's a typical example of team science and the impact it can have when people from different disciplines like chemists, bioinformaticians, cancer biologists and physicians work together,\" Czyzyk-Krzeska said. \"You have this combination of different expertise, and you start talking, and good things happen.\"\n\nMore information: Megan E.

        "article_content": "No-code workflow automation company Creatio has updated its core platform to version 8.2 with (no surprises) a new emphasis on AI. The company which has a particular focus on CRM workflows says that it has engineered a combination of AI and no-code technologies together in a way that avoids what it calls the \u201coverengineered\u201d glut of SaaS applications that perhaps stem from bloated enterprise software stacks that try to offer too many functions or are tough to implement.\n\nThe snappily named Creatio Energy 8.2 replaces static forms and data with conversational prompts for key knowledge worker roles.\n\nAgentic, generative & prescriptive AI\n\n\u201cWith the launch of Energy, Creatio continues to disrupt the business automation landscape with no-code and AI,\u201d said Katherine Kostereva, CEO at Creatio. \u201cThe release combines agentic, generative and prescriptive AI with our no-code tools, empowering business technologists to innovate and optimize operations. Creatio Copilot delivers a unified AI architecture with a robust set of the latest AI capabilities, all configured with no-code tools and ready to use from day one.\u201d\n\nAccording to the September 2024 Forrester report, The Four Agreements of Modern Business Apps, \u201cAI is the force that most clearly marks the upcoming new era of business apps. To survive (and even thrive) in this new era, vendors must reimagine business apps to offer greater streams of value. They must become truly intelligent, dynamic, adaptable, and composable, be powered by cloud platforms, and offer AI, low-code, and marketplaces. \u201c\n\nWhat\u2019s inside Creatio Energy?\n\nInside the toolkit on offer here we find Creatio Copilot, which now offers AI skills i.e. a set of software functions that manifest themselves as blocks so that Copilot can execute specific intelligent tasks that help workers to complete what are generally front office tasks related to services and sales.\n\nWith Creatio\u2019s no-code tools, users can create new AI skills using natural language, with no coding required. The Energy release also adds over 80 new no-code feature enhancements designed to improve no-code productivity. This is alongside unified agentic, generative and prescriptive AI.\n\nAgentic AI (in case the hype cycle has passed you by this year) being AI software agents that can perform specific workplace tasks with little or no human intervention and learn from their experiences with longer-term memory stores to work more effectively over time.\n\nGenerative AI (again, if the hype was somehow missed) functions are of course services that rely on large language models and vector databases to \u201cgenerate\u201d seemingly human-like answers to questions.\n\nPrescriptive AI (which arguably gets rather less love) are functions that rely on machine learning to perform data analytics designed to aid decision-making, but where human oversight is always advised.,\n\nAI Command Center\n\nCreatio Copilot also introduces a new AI Command Center that integrates all three AI types into a single platform. This unified approach provides organizations with the ability to design, deploy and refine AI skills without specialized technical expertise. AI Command Center provides tools that allow administrators to have visibility into AI skills adoption, including the ability to track consumption and users of each AI skill.\n\n\u201cThe new release seamlessly embeds over 20 pre-configured AI skills into sales, marketing and customer service processes, enabling intelligent automation that reduces friction, increases efficiency and enhances customer engagement,\u201d said CEO Kostereva. \u201cThis list will be rapidly evolving as new AI skills will be published rapidly from Creatio and its ecosystem of partners. Energy also adds over 100 new enhancements to CRM processes to improve user experience and drive greater automation.\u201d\n\nCreatio Energy hopes to promote user adoption by including AI as part of its base software license, providing what the firm says is a clear and predictable cost structure for organisations scaling their AI investments."

Read more\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump\u2018s impending return to the White House means he\u2019ll want to stand up an entirely new administration from the one that served under President Joe Biden. His team is also pledging that the second won\u2019t look much like the first one Trump established after his 2016 victory.\n\nThe president-elect now has a 75-day transition period to build out his team before Inauguration Day arrives on Jan. 20. One top item on the to-do list: filling around 4,000 government positions with political appointees, people who are specifically tapped for their jobs by Trump\u2019s team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: The latest news and updates following Election Day\n\nThat includes everyone from the secretary of state and other heads of cabinet departments to those selected to serve part time on boards and commissions. Around 1,200 of those presidential appointments require Senate confirmation, which should be easier with the Senate now shifting to Republican control.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect:\n\nWhat will the transition look like?\n\nThough the turnover in the new administration will be total, Trump will be familiar with what he needs to accomplish. He built an entirely new administration for his first term and has definite ideas on what to do differently this time.\n\nHe\u2019s already floated some names.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: To win Pennsylvania, Donald Trump did exactly what he needed to in Philly: Improved slightly\n\nTrump said at his victory party early Wednesday that former presidential hopeful and anti-vaccination activist Robert Kennedy Jr. will be tapped to \u201chelp make America healthy again,\u201d adding that \u201cwe\u2019re going to let him go to it.\u201d Ahead of the election, Trump didn\u2019t reject Kennedy\u2019s calls to end fluoridated water. Trump has also pledged to make South African-born Elon Musk, a vocal supporter of the Trump campaign, a secretary of federal \u201ccost-cutting,\u201d and the Tesla CEO has suggested he can find trillions of dollars in government spending to wipe out.\n\nThe transition is not just about filling jobs. Most presidents-elect also receive daily or near-daily intelligence briefings during the transition.\n\nIn 2008, outgoing President George W. Bush personally briefed President-elect Barack Obama on U.S. covert operations. When Trump was preparing to take office in 2016, Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice, briefed Michael Flynn, her designated successor in the new administration. In 2020, Trump\u2019s legal challenges of the election\u2019s results delayed the start of the transition process for weeks, though, and presidential briefings with Biden didn\u2019t begin until Nov. 30.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump won Pa. with more votes than any statewide Republican candidate in history. Here\u2019s how he did it.\n\nWho is helping Trump through the process?\n\nTrump\u2019s transition is being led primarily by friends and family, including Kennedy Jr. and former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, as well as the president-elect\u2019s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and his running mate, JD Vance. Transition co-chairs are Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, Haverford College\u2019s largest donor, and Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who previously led the Small Business Administration during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nLutnick said this year\u2019s operation is \u201cabout as different as possible\u201d from the 2016 effort, which was first led by Chris Christie. After he won eight years ago, Trump fired Christie, tossed out plans the former New Jersey governor had made and gave the job of running the transition to then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Pa. Democrats on what went wrong against Donald Trump and what\u2019s next\n\nAt the start of his first term, Trump assembled an original cabinet that featured some more mainstream Republicans and business leaders who ultimately disappointed, or broke publicly with him, or both. This time, Trump has promised to value loyalty as much as possible \u2014 a philosophy that may ensure he makes picks that are more closely aligned to his ideological beliefs and bombastic professional style.\n\nUnlike the campaign of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump\u2019s team didn\u2019t sign any pre-Election Day transition agreements with the General Services Administration, which essentially acts as the federal government\u2019s landlord. He has therefore already missed deadlines to agree with GSA on logistical matters like office space and tech support and with the White House on access to agencies, including documents, employees, and facilities.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Disappointed voters and organizers in Philadelphia say gender and racial biases contributed to Harris\u2019 loss\n\nNew transition rules\n\nIn 2020, Trump argued that widespread voter fraud \u2014 which hadn\u2019t actually occurred \u2014 cost him the election, delaying the start of the transition from his outgoing administration to Biden\u2019s incoming one for weeks.\n\nFour years ago, the Trump-appointed head of the GSA, Emily Murphy, determined that she had no legal standing to determine a winner in the presidential race because Trump was still challenging the results in court. That held up funding and cooperation for the transition.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump\u2019s win touches off a mix of celebration and trepidation in the Philly region\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Trump\u2019s efforts to subvert election results had collapsed across key states that Murphy agreed to formally \u201cascertain a president-elect\u201d and begin the transition process. Trump eventually posted on social media that his administration would cooperate.\n\nTo prevent that kind of holdup in future transitions, the Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 mandates that the transition process begin five days after the election \u2014 even if the winner is still in dispute. That is designed to avoid long delays and means that \u201can \u2018affirmative ascertainment\u2019 by the GSA is no longer a prerequisite for gaining transition support services,\u201d according to agency guidelines on the new rules.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump\u2019s growing support among Latino voters helped him clinch battleground Pennsylvania\n\nThe uncertainty stretched even longer after the 2000 election, when five weeks elapsed before the Supreme Court settled the contested election between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. That left Bush with about half the usual amount of time to manage transitioning the government from the outgoing Clinton administration. That ultimately led to questions about national security gaps that may have contributed to the U.S. being underprepared for the Sept. 11 attacks the following year."

        "article_content": "Apple this week released the latest developer beta of tvOS 18.2, the software that powers the company\u2019s Apple TV 4K streaming media devices. As previewed during the WWDC 2024 keynote, the new software includes support for 21:9 and several other aspect ratios that are wider than 16:9, which has become the dominant shape for modern TVs.\n\nWhy does that matter?\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMost of us have experienced letterboxing or pillarboxing \u2014 that\u2019s when a set of horizontal or vertical black bars frame the content on our TVs. It happens when there\u2019s a mismatch between the aspect ratio of a movie or show and the aspect ratio of your screen.\n\nA lot of modern content, especially shows and movies developed for streaming services like Netflix, Max, Paramount+, or Apple TV+, is shot in 16:9, so letterboxing that content on 16:9 TVs isn\u2019t necessary. On the Apple TV 4K, even the user interface is formatted for this ratio, which keeps things looking good.\n\nHowever, some folks own projector screens or widescreen monitors with non-16:9 aspect ratios. For these people, all Apple TV 4K content ends up with those pesky black bars because the device\u2019s signal is formatted for 16:9. When tvOS 18.2 arrives for everyone in December, the software should automatically detect the ratio of your display, and reformat itself to match.\n\nIf that detection fails, a new Aspect Ratio settings menu will let you manually select the appropriate one for your setup. Available ratios are 16:9, 21:9, 2.37:1, 2.39:1, 2.40:1, DCI 4K, and 32:9.\n\nIt will be the first time that someone who owns a 21:9 projector, or who uses an anamorphic lens to achieve a ratio like 2.39:1, can get the Apple TV 4K to produce a perfectly proportioned and fullscreen image.\n\nSo how many people will benefit from the new settings? \u201cIt really won\u2019t affect very many,\u201d said Jeff Gosselin, chief experience officer at Cloud 9 AV, a Toronto-based custom home theater installer. \u201cAny new theaters we have done in the past 15 years have all used 16:9 screens. For any ultrawide projection systems, this will be an enhanced viewing experience.\u201d\n\nPillarboxing will still likely occur when watching 16:9 content on such a screen, but when 21:9 content is available, it should play in fullscreen, with no black bars.\n\nPresumably, app developers \u2014 like the services mentioned above \u2014 will have to update their apps to ensure that their content displays correctly under the new aspect ratio settings. But eventually, this will become the norm."
