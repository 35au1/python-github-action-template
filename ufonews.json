        "article_content": "UFOs came to Washington again today.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth\" at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C. at 11:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday (Nov. 13). Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) is a relatively new catch-all term that includes sightings of unexplained objects or events that take place in the air, underwater, in space, or that travel between those domains.\n\nLike previous congressional UFO hearings, today's event featured testimony from current U.S. military personnel who claim the American government has for decades hidden evidence of advanced technologies and otherworldly visitors from the public. A multitude of anecdotes were presented about flying orbs coming out of the ocean, disc-shaped objects, and craft \"exhibiting flight and structural characteristics unlike anything in our arsenal.\" While such claims are nothing new, what is noteworthy about today's hearing are the pedigrees of some of the whistleblowers who testified, including a former U.S. counterintelligence officer, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former NASA associate administrator. All of them stressed the need for more government transparency, less stigma about the UFO topic and new policies to bring UAP data out of the \"black\" classified world and into the public domain.\n\nA still from a video titled \"Go Fast\" recorded by a U.S. Navy aircraft reportedly showing a UAP that was discussed in the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth\" on Wednesday (Nov. 13). (Image credit: U.S. Department of Defense)\n\nThis isn't the U.S. government's first attempt to investigate the recent wave of UFO claims that began in 2017. A similar hearing was held last year, in which a whistleblower told Congress the U.S. government is hiding evidence of 'non-human intelligence.'\n\nThe Pentagon also created the All-Doman Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate UAP reports and government data about UFOs, but critics, including some government officials, are skeptical of the office's aims and methods.\n\nRelated: UFO whistleblower tells Congress the US government is hiding evidence of 'non-human intelligence'\n\n\"AARO is unable, or perhaps unwilling, to bring forward the truth about the government's activities concerning UAPs,\" Representative Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) said during the hearing's opening remarks today. \"I'm disturbed that AARO itself lacks transparency; even its budget is kept from the public. So if there is no 'there' there, then why are we spending money on it? And by how much? Why the secrecy?\"\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nOther representatives stressed the need for transparency and data analysis today, a common theme of other recent UAP studies. \"We have evidence that what we are detecting things, and we know that we don't understand them, and this is worth investigating,\" Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said. \"I believe we can always be more transparent. To me, this hearing and others are simply about the truth and getting to the facts of what these UAPs actually are.\"\n\nLuis Elizondo, a former U.S. counterintelligence officer who has been vocal about such claims in recent years, told the assembled representatives at the hearing that \"excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public \u2014 all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nWe are \"in the midst of a multi-decade, secretive arms race \u2014 one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies,\" Elizondo stated during his testimony.\n\nElizondo, who claims to have previously investigated UFOs as part of a secret Pentagon program, suggested that the U.S. government create a \"whole-of-government\" approach to studying UAP, create a national UAP strategy and offer protections so that whistleblowers who are \"desperate to do the right thing can come forward without fear.\"\n\nDuring questioning, Elizondo was asked if some of the \"advanced technologies\" that have been seen monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe could be operated by aliens or private companies. \"Maybe both,\" Elizondo replied.\n\nElizondo also stated point-blank to Rep. Mace's questioning that the U.S. government has programs to retrieve crashed UAP and reverse-engineer them, but avoided giving any specifics in an unclassified public setting such as the hearing.\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) then questioned Elizondo, asking the former counterintelligence agent about a document he signed that limits him from speaking publicly about crash retrieval programs. \"The document said you can't talk about crash retrieval. Well, you know, you can't talk about Fight Club if there's no Fight Club, correct?\"\n\nLike other witnesses, Elizondo stated that the alleged excessive government secrecy around UFOs harms national security. In response to questioning from Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN), Elizondo stated that, if UAP sightings turned out to be technologies operated by adversarial nations, it would be \"an intelligence failure eclipsing 9/11 in order of magnitude.\"\n\nA still from footage shot by an MQ-9 reaper drone showing an unidentified spherical object soaring through the air shown to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services during an April 2023 hearing. (Image credit: U.S. Dept. of Defense)\n\nRetired U.S. Navy rear admiral Tim Gallaudet offered similar testimony as Elizondo. \"We know from last year's UAP hearing and recent statements and publications by credible whistleblowers that UAP, NHI [non-human intelligence], and their technology of unknown origin (TUO) represent a new realization that we are not the only advanced intelligence in the universe,\" Gallaudet said on Wednesday, according to his published remarks.\n\n\"Unelected officials in the U.S. government do not have an exclusive right to this knowledge about the nature of reality. The American people have a right to that knowledge,\" Gallaudet said. The retired rear admiral also stressed the national security and airspace safety concerns related with UAP sightings, calling them \"extensive.\"\n\nWhen Rep. Garcia asked Gallaudet and other witnesses what UAP might represent, the retired rear admiral said he believes they are evidence of a \"non-human higher intelligence.\"\n\nFormer NASA Associate Administrator for Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold also testified at today's hearing, and previously served on NASA's UAP study team. Gold's testimony was more grounded; for example, he stressed the need for NASA to contribute its authority and expertise toward analyzing what UAP data it might already possess and helping dispel the stigma associated with the UFO topic.\n\n\"Our best tool for unlocking the mystery of UAP is science, but we cannot conduct a proper inquiry if the stigma is so overwhelming that just daring to be part of a NASA search team elicits such a vitriolic response,\" Gold said during today's hearing. \"Therefore, one of the most important actions that can be taken, relative to exposing the truth of UAP, is to combat the stigma, and this is where I believe that NASA can be eminently helpful.\"\n\nGold added that NASA has a massive archive of data that could possibly contain evidence of UAP, and suggested that artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms could help sort through the agency's trove of data to help shine light on the UFO phenomenon. In addition, the former NASA associate administrator said the agency should develop specialized instruments that might be able to gather useful data about UAP.\n\nRelated: NASA UFO report finds no evidence of 'extraterrestrial origin' for UAP sightings\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger also testified today, telling the representatives that there's a \"growing body of evidence that the government is not being transparent about what it knows about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly called UFOs, and that elements within the military and IC [intelligence community] are in violation of their Constitutional duty to notify Congress of their operations.\"\n\nShellenberger stated that there is a secret program within the U.S. government known as \"Immaculate Constellation\" whose sole purpose is to collect UFO and UAP reports from military personnel and sensor data and quarantine them away from the rest of the government and military. While he noted that a Pentagon spokesperson has stated no such program exists, Shellenberger recounted prior examples in which the Department of Defense has initially denied knowledge of UAP-related information only to later change its stance and either admit the information exists or release it to the public.\n\n\"The U.S. government appears to know significantly more about UAPs than it is revealing,\" Shellenberger said at the hearing. \"But even those who believe the U.S. government has revealed all that it knows should have no objection to Congressional demands for greater transparency.\"\n\nTo conclude the meeting, Rep. Mace asked each of the witnesses to define what non-human biologics or non-human intelligence mean to each of them.\n\n\"I don't think it's a stretch, when you look at the diversity of life on this planet and the size of this universe, to think that there will be more diverse, higher-order, non-human intelligence throughout the universe, and that's probably what's visiting us,\" Gallaudet said.\n\nElizondo stated he would take a scientific approach: \"The definition would be the ability to react to a stimulus in a manner that requires an intellectual thought process.\"\n\nGold, meanwhile, questioned whether non-human intelligence necessarily implies life, suggesting sophisticated artificial intelligence might be responsible for some UAP encounters. Shellenberger simply stated he did not know what they might be.\n\nRelated: The search for alien life\n\nIn today's hearing, as in other UFO hearings, there was a lot of telling and not a lot of showing. One of the core tenets of these whistleblower testimonies is that much of the credible UFO data is classified and can't be revealed to the public based on the military capabilities that some of that data could reveal.\n\nWhistleblowers have attested for years that, because advanced or classified sensors and satellites sometimes capture footage or photos of unexplained phenomena or advanced craft, those photos or videos are likewise classified by the U.S. government in order to not reveal America's full surveillance or sensing capabilities.\n\nSuch was the case in 2023 when U.S. military aircraft shot down a mysterious object off the coast of Alaska. The American government has yet to release any imagery from the event, but a Canadian freedom of information request unveiled a photograph earlier this year of a balloon-like object.\n\nThose incidents and others like it, such as a weeks-long drone incursion above Langley Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., were discussed in today's hearing. \"The origin of these drones and their operators remains a mystery,\" Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said. \"This incident and other sightings near sensitive military installations highlights the complexity of the UAP challenge facing our intelligence, defense and homeland security committees.\""

Read our coverage for more details and videos from the hearing.\n\nThe U.S. government is holding another hearing on UFOs today, and you can watch it live.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representative's Committee on Oversight and Accountability will administer the hearing, titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\" The name of the event refers to UFOs by their new preferred acronym, which is more inclusive of sightings that might take place not only in the air but also in space, as well as those that take place across multiple domains.\n\nThe hearing will be held at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington D.C. at 11:30 a.m. ET (1630 GMT) on Wednesday (Nov. 13). You can watch it live here on Space.com, courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.\n\nThis marks the second congressional hearing U.S. Congress has put together in order to \"further pull back the curtain on secret UAP research programs conducted by the U.S. government, and undisclosed findings they have yielded,\" according to a House statement. The hearing will examine the U.S. Department of Defense's strict classification policies when it comes to UAP and related topics, and will explore ways to \"make sure the American public is better informed on this topic.\"\n\nThis will be a joint hearing, led by representatives Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) and Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), who argue that \"the American people are tired of the obfuscation and refusal to release information by the federal government,\" according to the House's statement.\n\n\"Americans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nExpert witnesses in the hearing will include Luis Elizondo, a decorated former counterintelligence officer who has claimed for years that the U.S. government is hiding knowledge of UAP, including materials recovered from crashed flying saucers.\n\n\"The cover-up and disinformation campaign has been so successful that most scientists do not even know UAP are real,\" Elizondo wrote in his 2024 book \"Imminent.\" The book also claims that four \"deceased nonhuman bodies\" were recovered from the infamous 1947 crash in Roswell, New Mexico and that \"China and Russia do not have the same stigma and can employ their scientists to work on this topic for them.\"\n\nElizondo has also claimed firsthand knowledge of U.S. programs that employ individuals with psychic powers to \"remote view\" distant locations. Most recently, the former counterintelligence officer held a paid event where a photo was shown that Elizondo claimed was a \"real photo\" of a \"mothership\" UFO above a U.S. embassy. Within days, the photo was found to be the reflection of a lamp in a window.\n\nThe House hearing will also include Tim Gallaudet, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who unidentified submersible objects, arguing that \"these underwater anomalies jeopardize US maritime security.\" Gallaudet has also told interviewers that his daughter is a \"medium\" who can communicate with spirits.\n\nOther speakers at the hearing include journalist Michael Shellenberger, who has also claimed the U.S. government is hiding UFO crash retrieval programs, and former NASA Associate Administrator of Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold, who is a member of NASA's independent UAP study team.\n\nAccording to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson's remarks in September 2024 when the team's report was released, \"the top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn.\"\n\n\"The NASA independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin, but we don't know what these UAP are,\" Nelson said."

We even saw concepts of undetectable malware created with the help of chatbots despite the protections that are typically built into these programs.\n\nMore recently, we heard about an attempted Gmail account takeover that utilized a voice call with what seemed to be a Google support person. The tech-savvy engineer who was targeted ended up spotting the scam and concluded that he was talking with an AI chatbot rather than a real human. While that hack attempt failed, attackers might still try to employ various AI tactics to get into your accounts.\n\nToday's Top Deals\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut AI like Google\u2019s Gemini can be used to protect people by looking out for patterns in calls and app behavior that users would not otherwise catch. That\u2019s exactly what Google is doing with Gemini on Pixel phones, which are about to get a couple of handy new AI-powered security features: Scam Detection for voice calls, live threat detection, and real-time alerts in Google Play Protect for apps.\n\nPixel phones as old as the Pixel 6 series will get the new AI security features first. Google will then eventually bring at least some of them to other Android handsets.\n\nGoogle detailed the new AI security features in a blog post on Wednesday.\n\nGoogle's new Scam Detection AI security feature.\n\nScam Detection will let you use Gemini Nano, Google\u2019s on-device AI, to listen to calls in real time. The AI will detect conversation patterns that are associated with scams and inform you as they happen:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf a caller claims to be from your bank and asks you to urgently transfer funds due to an alleged account breach, Scam Detection will process the call to determine whether the call is likely spam and, if so, can provide an audio and haptic alert and visual warning that the call may be a scam.\n\nThe feature will be turned off by default, but you can enable Scam Detection and disable it whenever you feel like it. Google says the security feature is built with privacy at the core. The calls are processed on the device via Gemini Nano, and the AI will not transmit any data to Google\u2019s servers:\n\nThe AI detection model and processing are fully on-device, which means that no conversation audio or transcription is stored on the device, sent to Google servers or anywhere else, or retrievable after the call.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the kind of privacy guarantee such security products need.\n\nScam Detection will start rolling out to Phone by Google public beta users in the US first. You\u2019ll need a Pixel 6 or later to use the feature, and English is the only supported language for now. Google is also encouraging users to submit feedback if they plan to use the feature while in beta.\n\nGoogle Play Protect will issue notifications in real-time about malicious apps.\n\nCalls are only a part of the problem. You can end up with malware apps on your phone, especially on Android, where it\u2019s easier to sideload apps than on iPhone. Sometimes, even apps in the Play Store turn out to contain malware despite Google\u2019s best efforts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGoogle\u2019s Wednesday announcement also covers new AI security features related to app installs. Google Play Protect already works in the background on the phone to protect against malware and unsafe apps in real time.\n\nThanks to the new features, live threat detection, and real-time alerts, Google Play Protect will now notify you in real-time that an unsafe app might be showing potentially harmful behavior.\n\nLike Scam Detection, the app-related AI security features will not collect user data while they monitor the Pixel phone:\n\nAt launch, live threat detection will focus on stalkerware, code that may collect personal or sensitive data for monitoring purposes without user consent, and we will explore expanding its detection to other types of harmful apps in the future. All of this protection happens on your device in a privacy preserving way through Private Compute Core, which allows us to protect users without collecting data.\n\nThe new Google Play Protect features are available on Pixel 6 phones and newer right now, and they\u2019ll expand to other Android phones in the coming months.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDon't Miss: Today\u2019s deals: $17.50 Apple AirTags, $50 off Madden NFL 25, $30 Crock-Pot Electric Lunch Box, more\n\nMore Top Deals\n\nSign up for BGR's Newsletter.

[CHINA DAILY]\n\nTapping cutting-edge technologies to drive operational efficiency and competitive advantage, multinational companies are advancing their commitment to digitally-driven growth in the Chinese pharmaceutical market.\n\nLarry Merizalde, CEO of Durban, South Africa-based pharmaceutical firm Aspen's China unit, said the company is leveraging advanced digital platforms to streamline business processes and boost operational efficiency.\n\n\"High digitization levels and rich, high-quality healthcare data can provide valuable benchmarks and insights, helping us align strategies with best practices and maintain a competitive edge among multinational companies,\" Merizalde said.\n\nAt this year's China International Import Expo, Aspen China unveiled a slew of new products to the market, including its original drug Florinef for rare disease treatment in the field of endocrinology, as well as Mivacron, a muscle relaxant in anesthesiology. Looking ahead, the company will focus on key areas such as anesthesiology, antithrombotic therapies, gastroenterology and osteoporosis in the Chinese market.\n\n\"Aspen China's business is data-driven. With the launch of a new supply chain system with local partners, we can respond more flexibly to market demand, optimize inventory management and reduce operational costs,\" said Xie Kunrong, CFO and COO of the company. \"Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in digital innovation and keep developing regulation-compliant systems that meet stringent industry standards.\"\n\nThe executive added that the multinational company recently developed a tailored digital system for the China market that enhances operational efficiencies while ensuring compliance with local regulations.\n\n\"There are notable differences between the Chinese and global markets. When foreign digital operating systems are introduced to China, they can encounter compatibility challenges, which, in some cases, increase operational costs for multinational pharmaceutical companies,\" said Tim Ding, general manager of the China unit at Veeva Systems, a global cloud computing company in the life sciences industry.\n\nIn an era where growth is largely driven by digitalization, Ding said China has emerged as a major source of innovation, especially in AI applications, with advancements that sometimes outpace global trends.\n\n\"Ideas and applications generated in China's forward-thinking digital ecosystem are increasingly feeding back to our global customers, fostering a beneficial cycle of innovation,\" he said.\n\nThe rapid progress in AI has also facilitated real-life applications within the pharmaceutical industry that may lead to higher returns, Ding added.\n\n\"AI acts as an accelerator. With quality data, AI can help drive innovation through the whole life cycle of the industry, optimizing processes from research and development and clinical trials to final commercialization stage,\" he said.\n\nAs an example, Ding said the company has been considering implementing AI-powered image recognition to identify the correct groups of physicians to invite to industry events, assess their engagement levels and measure their interest in specific topics, in order to reduce analytical costs while enhancing efficiency.\n\nHowever, to successfully deploy the innovative applications requires broad collaboration across departments within hospitals and pharmaceutical firms, and this is why digital platforms should place a strong emphasis on their consulting teams, helping clients navigate each stage of the process smoothly, rather than providing just technical support, he said.\n\n\"A key challenge is that many pharmaceutical companies still rely on varied operational models and processes across departments for customer communications,\" Ding said. \"Therefore, our focus in product design is to establish a unified operational standard and language to break down these departmental silos, which is expected to enable not only cross-departmental collaboration, but also coordination across entire organizational structures.\"\n\nThe company executive also mentioned that he has observed an accelerated digital transformation among multinational pharmaceutical companies in China. \"One reason is China's proactive stance on encouraging digital transformation across industries. And embracing China's digital ecosystem can also strengthen a company's global digital competence as a whole,\" he said.\n\nAs a long-time participant at the CIIE, Veeva has identified promising opportunities for international cooperation in the pharmaceutical ecosystem this year. For instance, building an ecosystem that combines products from all around the world could result in synergistic innovations, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n\"We can see many multinational pharmaceutical companies are deeply committed to the Chinese market, motivated by a long-term mission to advance human health,\" said Ding. \"We will also remain deeply rooted in the market, launch new products and contribute to the country's ongoing success.\""

        "article_content": "Trying to figure out the best way to curate your news diet these days can be, at best, difficult. Besides reading everything published by TechRadar, navigating and connecting news stories you want to follow up on can feel like a full-time job on its own. A new mobile app called Particle is employing AI to solve that problem. Particle's iOS app relies on AI to sift through the news, looking beyond headlines and across multiple platforms to create more comprehensive reports on current events and real-time answers to questions about the news.\n\nParticle offers customizable summaries of the news called Stories, claiming they are a more holistic way to explain what's happening in the world. You can ask the app to simplify the news by telling it to \"Explain Like I\u2019m 5\" or get the most concise, basic facts with the \"5Ws\" format of who, what, when, where, and why. If you want to see a range of opinions and views on a story, you can open the \"Opposite Sides\" summary for contrasting perspectives.\n\nYou can also ask for the summaries in audio form and in different languages. If just seeing summaries is too passive, Particle also has an AI chatbot to answer questions about stories and see what others have asked. The AI also adapts to your interests so you're more likely to see stories on the topics you care about.\n\n\"We\u2019re often scouring the news, looking for answers we might not even find. With Particle, you can get an instant answer to any question about the story. And because you can see other people\u2019s questions, sometimes the answer you\u2019re looking for is already there,\" Particle wrote in a blog post. \"We enable powerful and transparent control over which stories you see, and which you don\u2019t. On Particle, you can tune your interests to the topics that matter the most to you. Your news feed will adapt to your interests, bringing you the most relevant stories without the noise.\"\n\nAI journalistic aid\n\nAI's foibles being what they are, Particle tries to avoid issues of incorrect facts and hallucinations with reviews by AI models and human oversight. The stories all include links to original sources as well; useful if you see something that comes off as unlikely. If the AI gets something wrong, you can flag it to have Particle fix the error.\n\nEfficient news gathering is obviously appealing to busy people. Particle's app can be as in-depth or straightforward as you want, which is another benefit to those who want to be more engaged in current events but who sometimes just want the basic facts and other times want more background than any single article might include. I'd rather rely on Particle than on the sometimes garbled or misunderstood takes seen on social media. If you want to keep up with the news without spending all day sorting through different sources, I'd give it a try after you finish your daily read-through of every word published here.\n\nYou might also like"

The user base was larger than Baidu\u2019s Wenxiaoyan \u2013 formerly known as Ernie Bot \u2013 with 12.5 million users and Alibaba Group Holding-backed Moonshot AI\u2019s Kimi at 10 million. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nAs Beijing requires government registration of AI apps before they are made available to download onto smartphones and laptops, the Chinese market is dominated by domestic products, with little presence from globally popular apps like ChatGPT, which said it has over 180 million users.\n\nA screenshot of Doubao, the ChatGPT-like conversational bot developed by TikTok owner ByteDance.

Apart from tasks such as writing emails or summarising long texts, it also supports image, audio and video generation, data analysis, and AI-powered online search \u2013 a function that ChatGPT only recently acquired.\n\nThe wide array of capabilities has helped Doubao become the go-to AI app for Chinese consumers. ByteDance, however, has not announced any plans to monetise Doubao, even though it is costly to train such applications based on large language models.\n\nA consultant surnamed Cheng, who works in Hangzhou, said Doubao has become an effective tool for \u201cediting and improving text\u201d, and for its \u201clogical organisation of content\u201d. Zhu Jiahui, a software salesperson based in Beijing, said he is a frequent user of Doubao for its easy-to-use design despite it being feature-rich.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe app, accessible from its official website as well as on Android and iOS app stores, offers some of the most versatile capabilities among its local and global peers, according to analysts."

If it picks up signs of a possible scam during the conversation, it instantly warns the user.\n\nIn May, Google showed off the feature with a staged call from a fake bank representative. When the scammer tried to get the presenter to move money around, the AI immediately flagged it as a potential scam. You\u2019ll get a sound and vibration alert, along with a \u201cLikely scam\u201d warning on your screen. From there, you can end the call or mark it as \u201cNot a scam\u201d if it turns out to be legit.\n\nGoogle scam detection flashing warning on the screen\n\nGoogle reassures users that audio and transcriptions of calls aren\u2019t saved, sent to its servers, or stored anywhere after the call ends.

The feature is off by default, but you can turn it on either in the Phone app settings or individually for each call.\n\nInitially, Scam Detection will be available to Phone by Google public beta users in the U.S. For now, it only supports English. Google\u2019s also encouraging beta users to share their feedback to help improve the feature.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGoogle is also stepping up security with \"Live threat detection\" in Google Play Protect.

If anything shady pops up, you\u2019ll get an instant alert warning you about the threat. The notification includes a link to Play Protect, making it easy to remove any harmful apps right away.\n\nLive threat detection will focus first on spotting apps that grab personal data without your permission. But Google plans to widen its reach over time to catch a bigger variety of potentially harmful apps.\n\nSimilar to Scam Detection, the AI security features guarding against shady apps don\u2019t gather or store any user data.\n\nThe Scam Detection and Live threat detection features are live for Pixel 6 and newer models. Google vows to bring these security tools to more Android phones in the months ahead."

        "article_content": "Some of the victims of the Mount Vesuvius eruption in 79 A.D. in Pompeii were cast in plaster to preserve the scene.\n\nNew DNA studies of those victims tell a different tale than what experts had previously speculated.\n\nCommon interpretations of three well-known relationships were proven false by the scientific study.\n\nThe Mount Vesuvius eruption of 79 A.D. blanketed Pompeii in destruction. To preserve the historical nature of the event and help tell the stories of the residents of the city, some of the victims who had been buried by the ash and debris from the volcano were eventually cast in plaster. It turns out that the stories of a few of those individuals weren\u2019t quite as truthful as we previously thought.\n\nA new study\u2014published in Current Biology by a team of researchers at Harvard University and the Archaeological Park of Pompeii in Naples, Italy\u2014asserts that ancient DNA taken from some of the victims challenges stories long told about those particular Pompeii citizens.\n\n\u201cThe findings demonstrate the importance of integrating genetic analysis with archaeological and historical information to enrich or correct narratives constructed based on limited evidence,\u201d Alissa Mittnik, a co-author of the study, said in a statement.\n\nRelated Story Roman Coins, Graves Found in Pompeii Shop Dig\n\nFor decades, many of the stories told about the relationships and connections between individuals discovered within the Archaeological Park of Pompeii were based simply on the physical appearances of the victims and their proximity to one another. In one situation, for example, the tableau of an adult with a golden bracelet holding a child on their lap was interpreted as a mother holding her offspring. This recent DNA analysis, however, shows that there was no maternal presence or any familial relationship involved in the scene. Instead, the adult in the scene wearing the jewelry was a male who was biologically unrelated to the child.\n\nA second scene features four victims huddled together, often believed to be a family. But when the research team analyzed DNA from three of the victims, they found no genetic ties between them.\n\nIn a third situation, two individuals are seen lying in what is believed to be an embrace. Some have hypothesized the two people could be sisters, a mother holding a daughter, or even lovers. The DNA shows that at least one of the two people was a male, eliminating two of the three common interpretations.\n\nThe ancient eruption buried several Roman towns, killing inhabitants and laying ash deposits across cities that preserved everything from buildings to sculptures and mosaics to human victims. Shortly following the eruption, rain helped functionally cement the bodies within the ash. When excavators descended upon the area centuries later, the outlines of roughly 1,000 victims remained and\u2014in over 100 cases\u2014the cavities were filled in with plaster to preserve their positioning.\n\nRelated Story Before Volcanoes, Pompeii Struggled with Potholes\n\nWhile this DNA analysis dispels some of the myths of Pompeii, the goal of the team behind this work was not necessarily to sleuth out any definitive histories. And DNA on its own wouldn\u2019t be enough to know the stories of these victims. For one, some of the remains may have been moved from their original positions, and the plaster casts could have been \u201ccreatively restored\u201d in the past, the study authors wrote. The team also warned that using so few clues, such as jewelry, to spin a full tale proves risky, especially in an area rich with differing cultures.\n\nThe intent of the team was never to get these stories right once and for all\u2014rather, they wanted to ensure that the tales were merely less wrong. \u201cInstead of establishing new narratives that might also misrepresent these people\u2019s experiences,\u201d David Reich, co-senior author of the study, said in a statement, \u201cthe genetic results encourage reflection on the dangers of making up stories about gender and family relationships in past societies based on present-day expectations.\u201d"

Unearthed was the remarkably preserved skull of a previously unknown bird species, Navaornis hestiae, from the Cretaceous Period. This discovery allowed researchers to digitally reconstruct the brain and inner ear anatomy of the ancient bird, providing significant clues to how modern avian brains, renowned for their cognitive abilities, evolved over millions of years.\n\nIn another significant development, researchers have documented catastrophic declines in African elephant populations across the continent. This comprehensive assessment, unveiled on Monday, revealed dramatic population drops of the savanna and forest elephant species. The study utilized data from population surveys at 475 sites spanning 37 countries from 1964 to 2016, painting a grim picture of these majestic mammals' plight.\n\nTogether, these findings emphasize the importance of understanding both past and present ecosystems. The fossil discovery not only enhances knowledge of avian evolution but underlines the necessity of tackling current biodiversity challenges, as evidenced by the declining numbers of African elephants, some of the planet's most intelligent and social creatures.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

Instead, it dates back more than 5,000 years, to the Neolithic, or New Stone Age, archaeologists say \u2014 thousands of years before the mythical king and his knights are said to have lived.\n\nThe scientists who were involved in recent excavations at \"King Arthur's Hall,\" an unusual rectangular structure on the Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, used several dating techniques to establish that the hall was built between 5,000 and 5,500 years ago.\n\nThe results challenge the idea that the structure had anything to do with the mythical Arthur, who would have lived in the fifth or sixth centuries A.D. \u2014 although most historians think he didn't exist at all and, in reality, was a medieval fiction based on traditional tales.\n\n\"Given that the monument is now 4,000 years older than most people thought, we now need to consider the monument within the context of Bodmin Moor's prehistoric landscape,\" Tim Kinnaird , a geochronologist at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, told Live Science.\n\nRelated: Graves of dozens of kings from the time of King Arthur uncovered in Britain\n\nKinnaird is an expert in optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), which can estimate when certain minerals were last exposed to the sun. The OSL results were combined with other dating techniques, such as the radiocarbon dating of buried pollen and insect eggs, to determine the age of the mysterious structure.\n\nKing Arthur's Hall isn't the only Neolithic structure associated with Arthur. Arthur's Stone , a 5,700-year-old chambered tomb in Herefordshire, is also linked through legend to the medieval king, with one story claiming that a giant battling Arthur at the site fell and left an imprint of its elbow on the tomb.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

(Image credit: Cornwall National Landscape)\n\nKing Arthur's Hall\n\nKing Arthur's Hall is an unusual solitary structure on a remote part of Bodmin Moor; the name \"moor\" here means \"open uplands,\" possibly from an Old English word meaning \"swamp.\" It is rectangular, consists of a bank of earth and stone measuring about 69 by 160 feet (21 by 49 meters), and is studded with 56 standing stones on the inner face of the embankment.\n\nHistoric England, a government agency, had listed the structure as a medieval animal pound, although its standing stones and north-south alignment suggested it might be prehistoric. Now, the new dating has established that the structure was built in the late fourth millennium B.C., during the Neolithic \u2014 a discovery that indicates it is older than the oldest parts of Stonehenge .\n\nKinnaird said in an email that King Arthur's Hall had now been revealed as one of several prehistoric monuments on Bodmin Moor, which indicates an active Neolithic community had built a rich landscape of monuments there. Other nearby Neolithic structures include \"tor enclosures,\" such as Rough Tor ; standing stones; and \"long barrows\" (burial mounds).\n\nImage 1 of 2 The excavations were carried out this summer by a team of scientists from several British universities and local archaeologists.

(Image credit: Cornwall National Landscape)\n\nDeath of Arthur\n\nCornwall's Bodmin Moor has long been regarded in legends as the site of Arthur's final Battle of Camlann. According to medieval Welsh texts, Arthur and his knights fought in the sixth century against the rebel forces of Mordred at Camlann \u2014 a location identified by some as the Cornish town of Camelford on the edge of Bodmin Moor, although there are rivals for the claim .\n\nLegends say Mordred \u2014 either Arthur's nephew or illegitimate son, according to various authors \u2014 was killed in the battle, while Arthur was fatally wounded and taken by a magical boat to the mystical island of Avalon .\n\nSeveral ancient sites around Bodmin Moor are linked with Arthurian legends, and in the 16th century it was said Arthur himself had frequented King Arthur's Hall. But the new results show the structure must have already been thousands of years old if Arthur ever went there.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cornwall Archaeology Society, which was also involved in the excavations, said the association with Arthur reflected the structure's unknown origins."

        "article_content": "No-code platforms are not dead yet. They are very much alive with the help of AI. Bengaluru-based Tablesprint aims to stand out as an AI-powered low-code platform, designed to bring enterprise-level applications to companies of all sizes.\n\nFollowing the recent $1 million seed funding round led by Ola\u2019s co-founder Ankit Bhati and other notable investors, Tablesprint co-founder and CEO Abhijeet Kumar discussed with AIM the company\u2019s vision, its distinct position in the market, and its potential to transform business operations globally, competing with the likes of Salesforce.\n\nKumar\u2019s background includes founding and scaling a successful startup that eventually became BigBasket\u2019s backbone. His experience in handling operations-heavy systems provided the foundation for Tablesprint\u2019s solutions. \u201cBigBasket is an enormous operation, especially from an operational and logistics perspective,\u201d Kumar noted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a consumer tech business that relies heavily on robust technology. That experience equipped us with the knowledge to tackle complex tech challenges, which now fuels Tablesprint\u2019s mission.\u201d\n\nAnother Low-code/No-code?\n\nWhile many platforms provide low-code options, Tablesprint aims to address a crucial gap in enterprise technology: accessibility and control over data. Traditional low-code platforms often offer limited control over sensitive information due to rigid structures and limited permissions.\n\nTablesprint\u2019s platform addresses this by incorporating robust data controls, permissions, and a secure backend infrastructure that integrates seamlessly with AI, ensuring that businesses can safely and effectively leverage their data. Rather than attempting to build AI models from scratch, Tablesprint focuses on integrating and optimising existing open-source and commercial models to provide a comprehensive, end-to-end solution that enterprises can trust.\n\nThe moat of Tablesprint? Unique blend of affordability and flexibility, positioning it as an alternative to established players like Salesforce and Zoho. \u201cWe\u2019re offering the flexibility of Salesforce but at a Zoho price,\u201d Kumar explained. \u201cOur focus is on creating a customisable, scalable system that can handle complex enterprise needs without the high costs usually associated with such solutions.\u201d\n\nTablesprint\u2019s competitive advantage, Kumar emphasised, lies in its capacity to offer a Salesforce-like experience at a fraction of the cost, with a user interface (UI) that simplifies complex tasks. \u201cWith us, you\u2019re not just getting a software tool; you\u2019re gaining a system that adapts to your needs, allows for high-level customisations, and integrates AI capabilities directly into the workflow.\u201d\n\nChirag Jadhav, co-founder and CTO, earlier highlighted the platform\u2019s multi-tenant system designed for both developers and business users. \u201cCreating a system that resonates with both developers and business stakeholders is a significant challenge. We are excited with our progress so far and look forward to tackling more challenges ahead on this journey.\u201d\n\nFounded earlier this year, Tablesprint\u2019s AI-first SaaS platform allows companies to rapidly build customisable applications for various business functions, including HR, sales, operations, and vendor management, using open-source and closed-source models available in the market.\n\nIts no-code solution features modular building blocks such as AI write/image tools, workflows, and charts, enabling businesses to start with simple tasks like surveys and scale to full-fledged workflows.\n\nStaying Alive and Sprinting Ahead\n\nKumar is aware of the competition from established giants like Salesforce and Zoho, but he believes Tablesprint offers unique advantages that make it attractive, particularly for businesses conscious of both costs and customisation capabilities.\n\n\u201cTry making a form in Zoho, and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s not designed with seamless user experience in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cOur UI is optimised to make processes intuitive and efficient, making it appealing to users who need functionality without the overhead.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Kumar highlighted the often limited adoption rate of Salesforce due to its complexity and high price point, particularly in markets like India, where cost sensitivity is paramount. According to him, only around 34% of Salesforce licences end up being used because companies struggle with its complexity. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting that space by offering a similarly robust platform that\u2019s also simpler to use and much more affordable.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s go-to-market strategy involves partnering with implementation providers, giving entrepreneurs and developers the flexibility to use Tablesprint to build apps, which they can then offer to clients as solutions. \u201cTablesprint is not just an India-specific product; it\u2019s a global solution designed to help businesses worldwide streamline operations, build apps, and generate revenue by offering our platform as a customisable solution,\u201d Kumar explained.\n\nTablesprint\u2019s roadmap is ambitious. The company plans to expand its offerings by building a complete AI-based ERP system and form builder, with the goal of becoming a one-stop shop for enterprise applications across industries.\n\nDespite the increasing saturation in the low-code, no-code market, Kumar is confident that Tablesprint\u2019s model and global reach will help the company thrive in the long term.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still a startup, so bandwidth is sometimes an issue,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWe have so much interest that we have to pick and choose our clients carefully because we want to ensure each implementation is successful and adds value.\u201d\n\n(Total 26 views)"

        "article_content": "For the most part, Google has issued an update to the Pixel Watch roughly once a month. Most were simple security updates, while others included new features and OS upgrades. Fans expected an update in October, but Google delayed it until this month. This update will resume the rollout of Wear OS 5 to Pixel Watch 1 and Pixel Watch 2 users after a series of crashes caused Google to pause it back in September. After several months of work, the company has addressed the cause of the crashes and is confident that yesterday\u2019s update will be stable.\n\nIn addition to Wear OS 5, the update will also include better camera controls and changes to the Pixel Recorder app, which will be available through the Play Store. Your individual watch will notify you when the update is available for download, so you don\u2019t have to constantly check for it. The first update for the Pixel Watch 3 since its launch is also coming with bug fixes and security updates. All Pixel Watch models will eventually update to version AW2A.241105.012, although when the update happens will depend on both the carrier and the device.\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019re going to have to wait a while for the next Pixel Watch software updates, which Google says won\u2019t come until March 2025. Before now, Pixel Watch users have never before seen a three-month gap in updates. The longest time between updates usually coincided with operating system upgrades, such as from Wear OS 3 to Wear OS 4. That said, slower updates aren\u2019t necessarily a downside. By reducing the time spent on deploying bug fixes, Google could potentially focus on releasing regular, larger updates \u2014 maybe quarterly versus monthly.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile the wait is unfortunate, it does have a gleaming silver lining. The schedule for the next update lines up with a March Feature Drop. You can expect some significant upgrades and improvements, along with a few updates we already know are coming like the Android 15 QPR2 beta. Expect to see changes not only in how the Pixel Watch works, but also in how it interacts with Android. It\u2019s also safe to say that there are likely several surprises we haven\u2019t come across yet."
