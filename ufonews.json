        "article_content": "Trump's second term in office could be good news for UFO enthusiasts, Nick thinks\n\nThere could be \"seismic\" consequences for UFO disclosure after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States for the second time. Nick Pope, who once worked for the Ministry of Defence's UFO department, told the Mirror Trump's presidency is the \"perfect storm\". He explained: \"It's the perfect storm: a maverick, populist President in his second term, and \u2013 thus \u2013 not up for re-election.\" Pope added that Trump's unique standing could provide an unprecedented opportunity for transparency. He went on: \"For those in the UFO community who believe there's been a decades-long conspiracy to cover up the truth about an alien presence, Trump in his second term offers the best-ever hope for pushing back against the Deep State and delivering Disclosure.\"\n\nNick is regarded as one of the leading lights in UFO research\n\nHis views tie in with previous speculations that official revealings regarding extraterrestrial contact may coincide with the forthcoming Inauguration Day in January. Nick, a staunch critic of governmental secrets and manipulation, has showcased his opposition through his latest documentary, Apocalypse Covid, which aims to uncover \"the flawed response and government overreach during the pandemic\". US-based Nick suggests that Trump has been hinting at being privy to significant secrets regarding extraterrestrial contact. He added: \"I believe Trump views the subject in the same way as he views the JFK files, where, if there's top secret information still being withheld, it should be declassified and released. \"Trump released most of the JFK files in his first term and has essentially undertaken to release the rest early in his second term. As he seems to link the two issues, there's a strong possibility of bombshell UFO information being released early in 2025, soon after his inauguration.\"\n\nTrending\n\nTrump has often hinted that he knows something about extraterrestrials\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Timothy Gallaudet, who has spoken about his experiences with UAPs and unexplained submerged objects.\n\nNetflix faces lawsuit over \u2018The Manhattan Alien Abduction\u2019\n\nA full witness list has not been released, and in previous hearings, witnesses have expressed fears of intimidation or stigma associated with speaking openly about UAPs.\n\nThe Defense Department has repeatedly denied that there are secret UFO or UAP programs in existence, though it did admit to plans for the Kona Blue program, which would have reverse-engineered UAP technology.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, the program was never stood up because no such technology was ever recovered.\n\nA report from the department\u2019s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) said that most UAP reports were cases of mistaken identity involving drones or top-secret technology. The office said there is no evidence that UAPs are alien in nature.\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s initial public hearing, a bipartisan group of lawmakers has continued to have closed-door hearings on the subject, expressing frustration at the lack of transparency around UAPs.\n\nDelphi murders: Prison psychiatrist describes Allen\u2019s psychosis and treatment\n\nRecent reporting from independent journalist Michael Shellenberger revealed the existence of a whistleblower report that names, for the first time, an alleged Pentagon UAP program: Immaculate Constellation.\n\nThe individual whistleblower in that report has not been identified, and it is not clear if they will be among the witnesses in the upcoming hearing.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "article_content": "Tech companies continue to roll out new generative AI apps and services. Microsoft (MSFT) has its Copilot for Windows; Apple (AAPL) has Apple Intelligence for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac; Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has Gemini for its apps and Pixel phones; and Meta (META) has Meta AI for its various social media services. But despite all of the hype, I\u2019m still not sold on these apps. At least not yet.\n\nI\u2019ve been using each company\u2019s products for a while now, and while they\u2019ve got some intriguing capabilities, none of them has the kind of features that make me want them to be a part of my daily life. The problem, at least so far, is that much of what these companies have to offer are solutions for niche situations or kitschy demos for what\u2019s to come down the line.\n\nWhether that\u2019s manipulating photos to completely alter their settings, changing an artificial intelligence app\u2019s voice to a celebrity\u2019s voice, or creating generative AI-based emojis, I haven\u2019t come across a single generative AI feature that would convince me to spend $800 on a new phone or PC or make me want to change how I use apps. But there\u2019s potential on the horizon.\n\nLimited uses for most users\n\nIf you\u2019re an Android user, you\u2019ve likely at least tried some of the company\u2019s generative AI capabilities via Google\u2019s Pixel phones or Samsung\u2019s Galaxy line of devices. There\u2019s the ability to edit photos to do things like make your 4-year-old appear as though she\u2019s dunking a basketball on a regulation-height hoop or that your dog is driving your car. You can also reimagine your photos to, say, transform a road into a rushing river, or even add objects to them that weren\u2019t there before.\n\nApple also offers photo editing capabilities with its first wave of Apple Intelligence features, though it\u2019s far tamer than Google\u2019s, only allowing you to remove objects from the background of your photos like a person walking behind your subject in a shot or a cup off of a table.\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot+PCs are Windows PC with added generative AI features like the company's Copilot chatbot software. (JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\nMeta AI can pull off the same tricks as Google, letting you do things like remove large objects from images or transform the floor in a photo into lava. It\u2019s all a bit of fun to use at first, but unless you\u2019re spending a lot of time posting the perfect shot to Instagram every day, there\u2019s little reason to regularly use these apps. Is that worth buying a new $799 iPhone or $999 for a Surface laptop or changing your routine to use a new piece of software? Not really.\n\nTech companies are also offering features that can summarize large chunks of text, rewrite emails to make them more professional or more casual, and prepare bullet points to help quickly digest the most important parts of a report. These can be helpful if you\u2019re trying to plow through a massive document, but it\u2019s hard to imagine most people taking advantage of such an option in their daily lives.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re the type of person who needs to closely read reports, surveys, or emails for exact details, you\u2019re probably not going to put all of your trust into a generative AI app to get all of the information you require, especially when they\u2019re able to make up information and then present it as though it\u2019s fact.\n\nI find chatting with AI bots helpful at times, but it still hasn\u2019t replaced Google as my go-to for looking up information on the web. And I\u2019m definitely not about to pony up a chunk of change just to chat with a robot.\n\nThere\u2019s more to come\n\nWhile the first slate of generative AI apps and services may not be the generation-defining raft of technologies that tech companies have been hyping them as, there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity ahead.\n\nApple plans to continue to update its Apple Intelligence platform throughout the rest of 2024 and into 2025, while Google and Microsoft regularly announce new capabilities for their respective consumer generative AI offerings. Meta also continues to debut new options for its own Meta AI service.\n\nBut the real excitement will come as third-party developers begin to push out their own generative AI-enabled apps over the months and years ahead. What we\u2019re getting right now is sort of a test run of what generative AI can do for the average consumer, but third-party developers will likely be the ones that give us the killer apps that make the technology a hit among users.\n\nThink of it like when Apple first launched the App Store. Sure, iPhones were cool and interesting, but sales really took off once Apple allowed third-party developers to start selling apps of their own for its flagship device. If generative AI is going to be as revolutionary a product as the tech industry promises, it\u2019ll be third-party developers that get us there.\n\nNow we just have to wait for them to do their thing.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

        "source": "Windows Latest",
        "article_content": "It\u2019s finally happening. Back in February, Windows Latest reported that Microsoft is planning to add Copilot AI to Notepad, a feature that will allow you to create content using generative AI on Windows 11. With today\u2019s preview update, AI in Notepad is now rolling out to testers, but remember, it may not show for everyone just yet.\n\nThe feature is called \u201cRewrite in Notepad,\u201d and it basically allows you to rewrite your existing content. At the moment, it cannot create content from scratch. The \u201cRewrite\u201d feature is designed to refine or improve existing content, and Microsoft officials said that it is powered by \u201ca powerful AI model named GPT.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the \u201cGPT\u201d model is referring to ChatGPT or something else, but it\u2019s fair to assume it\u2019s ChatGPT. With Rewrite in Notepad, you can reword sentences and change tone, making them sound more formal, casual, inspirational, or humorous. You can also change the format of their text.\n\nYou can keep it as default or convert it into different styles like a paragraph, list, business format, academic style, marketing pitch, or even poetry.\n\nAt Windows Latest, we test everything before we discuss it in articles, so I also tried Notepad\u2019s AI rewrite. It\u2019s quite handy, and its performance is impressive. It gets the job done.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at how the AI works inside Notepad and what happens behind the scenes.\n\nHands on with AI rewrite in Notepad on Windows 11\n\nFirst and foremost, AI rewrite in Notepad is exclusive to testers in the Canary and Dev Channel of the Windows Insider Program. It\u2019s available only in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Germany and Canada.\n\nYou also need to sign into your Microsoft account to use AI in Notepad. The feature requires authentication, and it sends your content to Azure.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s online service does not store the text or generated content after processing, ensuring that your data remains private and secure,\u201d Microsoft officials clarified.\n\nMicrosoft limits the usage and performance based on the \u201cCredits\u201d system. If you run out of credits, you\u2019ll need to subscribe to Copilot Pro or wait for a month.\n\n\u201cAI credits reset on the first day of each month,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson told Windows Latest. Copilot Pro removes the credit usage limit.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see the updated Notepad experience, you can check for updates, but Microsoft told us the feature isn\u2019t widely available yet.\n\nHow to use ChatGPT \u201cRewrite\u201d in Notepad for Windows 11\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to write something yourself and then select the text where you want AI rewrite to work. For example, in my case, I had written a short essay on Dogs, and I selected everything except the first line. Then, I clicked the Rewrite button in the toolbar to access it.\n\nYou\u2019ll see the following options as you as you click on the Rewrite button:\n\nRewrite\n\nMake shorter\n\nMake longer\n\nChange tone\n\nChange format\n\nUnder \u201cChange Tone,\u201d the available options are:\n\nDefault\n\nFormal\n\nCasual\n\nInspirational\n\nHumor\n\nUnder \u201cChange Format,\u201d the available options are:\n\nDefault\n\nParagraph\n\nList\n\nBusiness\n\nAcademic\n\nMarketing\n\nPoetry\n\nThese options are self-explanatory, but you can find them again in the next AI pop-up if you\u2019re unsure.\n\nIn our tests, Windows Latest observed that Notepad AI generates three versions of the content. The three variants are slightly different from each other, and the system prompt is apparently all about switching between words. They do not change the content significantly, but the third version has more changes compared to the second.\n\nYou can use the arrow keys to go through the three variants. You can finalize one of the variants, but you again have the choice to change everything.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s a \u201cLength\u201d button with a dropdown menu. When clicked, it gives you options to make the text similar in length, shorter, or longer. Next, there is a \u201cTone\u201d button with a dropdown, where you can adjust the tone of the text.\n\nThere\u2019s also a \u201cFormat\u201d button (labeled as \u201cList\u201d in the below screenshot).\n\nUnder the rewritten text, there\u2019s a Replace button, which will replace your original text with this new version if you are happy with it.\n\nThere\u2019s a star icon with a number (showing 46). This shows your AI credit points. When you run out of credits, AI will take longer than usual to generate content.\n\nIs more Copilot stuff coming to Notepad in Windows 11?\n\nMicrosoft also quietly tested the AI integration in Notepad in a blog post published last month, but nobody noticed it.\n\nIn it, the company stated that Microsoft 365 subscribers will get AI credits to use Copilot inside Office apps and elsewhere, including \u201capps like Paint, Photos, and Notepad on Windows.\u201d\n\nOnly time will tell what\u2019s next for Copilot inside Notepad, but it\u2019s clear the company is betting big on AI in Windows 11. It\u2019s hopeful that it can convince more people to subscribe to Copilot Pro to remove the AI credit balance limit.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you pay for Copilot Pro to limit AI limitations in Notepad and other Windows apps?"

Over the decades, several US outlets have carried stories about ghostly sightings and mysterious night-time noises plaguing the 18th-century building. On the big result day, these stories are circulating again on the internet, and here's what we know about them.\n\nAccording to a report in the Washington Post, there are numerous accounts of encounters with former residents, including the founding father and third president, Thomas Jefferson. However, the most famous spirit believed to haunt the White House is that of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president.\n\nIn 1946, President Harry S Truman wrote to his wife in a letter that is archived in his presidential library and museum.\n\n\"I jumped up and put on my bathrobe, opened the door, and no one there,\" he wrote. \"Went out and looked up and down the hall, looked in your room and Margie's. Still no one. Went back to bed after locking the doors and there were footsteps in your room whose door I'd left open. Jumped and looked and no one there! The damned place is haunted sure as shootin'. Secret Service said not even a watchman was up here at that hour.\"\n\n\"You and Margie had better come back and protect me before some of these ghosts carry me off.\"\n\nAccording to USA Today, the most famous ghost haunting the White House is undoubtedly that of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president. After his assassination in 1865, Lincoln's ghost reportedly appeared in both the Yellow Oval Room and the Lincoln Bedroom. He is said to have materialised to notable figures, including First Lady Grace Coolidge (wife of President Calvin Coolidge), British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, making him the most frequently sighted spirit in the White House.\n\nThe news outlet also reported that residents and staff members have, on various occasions, witnessed the ghost of Abigail Adams, America's second First Lady, hanging laundry or noticed a scent of lavender and damp clothing in the East Room.\n\nIn a 2018 interview on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Jenna Bush Hager shared that she heard 1920s piano music emanating from her room's fireplace. Jenna and her sister Barbara, daughters of President George W. Bush, heard music from the fireplace in the Lincoln Room on two separate occasions: first, 1920s piano music one week, and then opera music the following week, as Jenna later recounted to Hoda Kotb on the Today show.\n\n\"Our phone rang, and I woke up, and all of a sudden we heard like 1920s piano music coming out of our fireplace ... It was like the middle of the night, and you can feel the music out of the fireplace,\" Jenna said on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\".\n\n"

        "article_content": "Changing consumer demands and market trends keep the retail industry in a constant state of flux. In the race for sales and capital efficiency, the ability to adapt and innovate swiftly is a compelling edge for market leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the industry continues to change, retailers must hone that edge to enhance operational efficiency and customer experiences.\n\nAstute retailers identify and adopt solutions that can drive efficiency and growth for them. This is where no-code platforms have gained momentum. As evident from the term, no-code platforms enable users to create applications without writing code, accelerating development and deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo-code democratises software development through visual interfaces, drag-and-drop components, and pre-built modules, enabling non-technical employees to participate in creating software and applications. The approach offers several advantages, particularly in the retail sector, where domain experts own and manage processes.\n\nThese platforms present a compelling case for retailers looking to streamline processes and drive growth. While the benefits are evident, retailers must carefully evaluate platform-specific concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey must prioritise data governance and select platforms with a robust security architecture and safeguards. Additionally, evaluate the capacity of your platform provider to integrate with your ERP, accounting, point of sale (PoS), and legacy systems.\n\nDespite the challenges, the advantages of leveraging no-code platforms in retail are substantial. Speed of deployment, cost-effectiveness, flexibility, scalability, and the empowerment of non-technical staff are key benefits retailers stand to gain from using no-code platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speed of deployment allows retailers to create and implement programs quickly\u2014crucial in a fast-paced industry where consumer behaviour and market trends change rapidly.\n\nAlso Read Why multicloud is the future of enterprise cloud computing\n\nMoreover, the cost-effectiveness of no-code systems reduces the need for expensive developers and large IT teams, ultimately lowering TCO for your software. This cost reduction enables retailers to allocate resources more efficiently and explore innovative solutions for various aspects of their operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flexibility and scalability of no-code platforms also play a pivotal role in enabling retailers to adapt rapidly to new sales channels, special promotions, and legislative changes.\n\nHowever, retailers must strike a balance between speed and compliance when integrating no-code solutions into their existing systems. Instead of embarking on a complete ERP overhaul, a hybrid approach that combines no-code development with your existing ERP may be the ideal strategy to achieve the intended functionality and performance.\n\nIt will allow retailers to leverage the benefits of no-code platforms without compromising on the proven functionality offered by their existing ERP, however dated the experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother key consideration when balancing speed and compliance in retail transformation is the importance of data security and regulatory compliance. With increasing scrutiny on data privacy and protection, retailers must ensure that new technologies or processes meet the necessary compliance standards. By prioritising security and compliance from the outset, businesses can avoid costly setbacks and maintain customer trust.\n\nHere are a few situations that retailers have solved using no-code, instead of trying to fit their needs into their existing ERP:\n\nNew store opening: Every retailer and D2C brand has its methodology to identify locations and launch new stores\u2014a process that evolves constantly. NSO software built on no-code can be deployed in as little as a week, while it will be a months-long effort with ERP customisation. Lease management: Multi-unit retailers with multiple outlets are constantly dealing with landlords, lease payments, and utility bill payments for their outlets. Missing a lease payment exposes the outlet to closure, immediately affecting sales, while missing utility bill payments degrades the store experience. Building a custom lease administration solution that is configurable for your exact needs is possible without writing code; it can save lakhs of rupees every month from shut stores or missed invoices. Asset maintenance: Conventional methods for ensuring timely repair and maintenance of store and enterprise assets are heavily reliant on external systems, human processes, and disjointed communication. It leads to missed maintenance schedules and poor asset performance. Using a no-code platform to build an app can automate the scheduling and tracking of asset maintenance while offering a single window to all assets at the enterprise and store level.\n\nThe transformative potential of no-code systems in retail cannot be overlooked. By enabling rapid application development, cost control, and innovation promotion, these platforms are revolutionising the way retailers operate and serve their customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith careful consideration and strategic implementation, no-code platforms have the potential to drive significant growth and efficiency in the retail industry without necessitating a complete ERP overhaul.\n\nVinay Agrrawal is the Founder and CEO of Hubler."

        "article_content": "The iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra are both big phones with big screens, big power, and big price tags. The cameras are also impressive, but which one of these two archrivals takes better photos?\n\nI\u2019ve been using the Galaxy S24 Ultra again over the past few weeks and have put it against Apple\u2019s latest top iPhone to find out. And the results are pretty shocking.\n\nThe cameras\n\nBefore we look at the phones, let\u2019s look at the numbers behind the cameras, starting with the iPhone 16 Pro Max. There are three cameras on the back, starting with the main 48-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization, which can also take 2x zoom photos. It\u2019s joined by a 12MP telephoto camera for 5x optical zoom photos and a 48MP ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra has four cameras. It\u2019s led by a main 200MP camera, along with a pair of telephoto cameras \u2014 a 10MP camera for a 3x optical zoom and a 50MP periscope zoom for 5x optical shots \u2014 plus a 12MP ultrawide camera. Unlike previous Galaxy Ultra phones, the S24 Ultra has \u201coptical quality\u201d 10x zoom shots, which have proven to be just as good as optical zoom shots.\n\nFor reference, I used the Standard Photographic Style on the iPhone 16 Pro Max for all the photos below, and each phone\u2019s camera was used in auto mode. All the photos were downloaded onto an Apple Mac mini and examined on a color-calibrated monitor. They have all been resized for friendlier online viewing.\n\nMain camera\n\nWhen using the main camera, the iPhone 16 Pro Max consistently took more visually pleasing photos than the S24 Ultra, apart from its long-time issue with exposure occasionally rearing its head. In the first photo of the leafy lane, you can see where it causes the camera problems and where the S24 Ultra\u2019s colors are punchier and more vibrant.\n\nHowever, as you can see in the second photo of the Aston Martin Valkyrie car, the S24 Ultra\u2019s eagerness results in noise, which is entirely absent from the iPhone\u2019s pin-sharp, more accurately colored image. Although its exposure can cause issues sometimes, here, it gets it exactly right \u2014 to the point where I can easily read the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on the windscreen, which is blurred and jumbled in Samsung\u2019s photo.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra often gets a certain type of photo right, such as the example at the top, but everywhere else, the iPhone improves. The photo inside the church shows the wonderful tone and warmth of the iPhone\u2019s camera, rather than the starkness of the S24 Ultra, right down to the color of the padding on the seats and the wooden beams on the ceiling.\n\nTake a look at our final photo to see how the iPhone\u2019s super-sharp focus and depth of field help it take detailed, emotional shots, even of the simplest subjects. The foam and bubbles on top of the coffee are so sharp, and the depth of field is exactly right, making for a more realistic, attractive photo than the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo, which seems less aware of its subject.\n\nWinner: Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nUltrawide camera\n\nOn paper, the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s ultrawide camera should easily improve on the Galaxy S24 Ultra\u2019s camera, but in reality, it\u2019s the opposite. The S24 Ultra\u2019s ultrawide camera shows up the iPhone\u2019s camera really badly. The first photo of the Ferrari FF was taken indoors in good lighting (the same environment as the Aston Martin Valkyrie photo above), and the iPhone\u2019s photo is full of noise and blur, while the Galaxy S24 Ultra avoids most of the same issues to produce a sharper, less blurred image. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s far better than the iPhone\u2019s photo.\n\nOutside, things don\u2019t improve much for the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but it can still impress with its warm tones. The photo of the fields and sky shows the S24 Ultra\u2019s vibrant colors but overall coldness. However, it has a less noisy foreground and more detail, such as around the fence post. In the distance, the two cameras introduce some blur and noise.\n\nIn the final photo of the church, you can see how much sharper the S24 Ultra\u2019s ultrawide photos are, with the stonework on the spire far clearer and less muddy than in the iPhone\u2019s image. Yes, the S24 Ultra does use quite a lot of software enhancement, but it\u2019s easier to forgive it when the balance and sharpness is right.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\n2x zoom and 3x zoom\n\nThe two phones have different \u201cshort\u201d zooms, with the iPhone 16 Pro Max offering a 2x optical zoom and the S24 Ultra a 3x optical zoom. You can see examples of them both here, and we\u2019ll be judging this category as one rather than two separate categories. The 2x zoom is fairly consistent across both cameras for balance and focus, but the iPhone can introduce some noise, while the S24 Ultra\u2019s photos have a softer look.\n\nMove on to the 3x zoom across the two cameras, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max can\u2019t match the S24 Ultra\u2019s performance. Shots are far noisier and less sharp, while the Samsung phone\u2019s 3x zoom produces excellent photos with plenty of life and detail. This is to be expected, given Samsung\u2019s dedicated optical 3x mode.\n\nBut because the S24 Ultra\u2019s 2x mode isn\u2019t awful compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s 2x shots, it\u2019s going to win this category for being more versatile, as you could realistically use both zooms on it, but would want to stick with the 2x on the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\n5x zoom\n\nBoth cameras have 5x optical zooms, and Samsung continues its run of zoom superiority here too. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a problem with sharpness and focus, resulting in grainy, blurry, or noisy images that look worse the more you crop them down. These issues are missing from the S24 Ultra\u2019s camera, and its photos look great at 5x zoom.\n\nTake the wooden angel as an example. Not only are the colors and textures far more realistic in the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo, but when you crop it down, there\u2019s detail in the wood that the iPhone struggles to capture. The overall sharpness makes the depth of field pop more, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s photo appears flatter.\n\nPhotos taken outside have similar issues, but the iPhone does win a few points with generally more realistic colors. Many will like the S24 Ultra\u2019s fairly saturated colors, which stay consistent across all lenses. The donkey\u2019s fur is sharper and more defined in the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo, and there\u2019s clearly less noise on the wooden fence post and the red strap. Samsung wins the 5x zoom category, so will it make it three-for-three as we move to the 10x category?\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\n10x zoom\n\nNeither phone has a 10x optical zoom, but Samsung does make a point of highlighting its optical quality photos at 10x and does include a shortcut in its camera app. The iPhone does not, and things do start out quite well.\n\nThe horse photo reveals a similar level of detail, but when you get very close, there\u2019s far more evidence of software enhancements in the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo, with some haloing visible along the horse\u2019s back and ears. This glow is not in the iPhone\u2019s photo at all, giving it a more natural appearance.\n\nBut the iPhone does not always win here, as seen in the next photo of the wooden pub sign. The S24 Ultra\u2019s photo has less noise than the iPhone\u2019s photo, particularly on the green board, and its more dynamic coloring means the fall leaves glow more attractively.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra is far more consistent when shooting 10x photos, as the final photo of the car proves. The differences are clear \u2014 accurate colors, spot-on white balance, and no obvious noise. The iPhone can\u2019t keep up at 10x zoom.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nNight mode\n\nWhen it came to shooting photos in low light, the Galaxy S24 Ultra\u2019s preview on the phone made me expect the worst, as it did not show a truly representative image straight after taking it. The iPhone didn\u2019t have any such problem, so when I was collecting photos, I feared for the S24 Ultra\u2019s performance. However, the images looked totally different in the gallery, and at first, the two appeared quite evenly matched.\n\nThe outside of the brightly lit pub is a great example. The iPhone overexposes in many places while showing more detail than the S24 Ultra\u2019s photos in others. However, in most other areas \u2014 the seating and foliage, for example \u2014 both cope with the low light well. The iPhone\u2019s photo does have a little more blur, though, and the overexposure hides details, such as in the pub\u2019s signage.\n\nIn the photo of the village shop, the iPhone\u2019s more accurate colors shine through, and it\u2019s also less blurry than the S24 Ultra, where the software smooths out a lot of detail, showing both are very sensitive to lighting conditions when taking photos in the dark. The two trade blows like this in all the lowlight images I took, and while the iPhone\u2019s overexposure often caused problems, the S24 Ultra\u2019s smoothing often did the same.\n\nHowever, the S24 Ultra was great in difficult, harsh lighting conditions. Shooting into the sunset, the S24 Ultra captured the golden glow in the sky, the blue sky, the green of the grass, and the scene as a whole. The iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s photo contains so much shadow that it robs it of emotion and detail. The real-world environment was somewhere in between the two, but the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo is the one I\u2019d keep or share.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nSamsung\u2019s flagship comes out on top\n\nIt may come as a shock to some, but the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra \u2014 a phone released at the beginning of the year \u2014 has taken a victory in all but one category against the new Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max. It has by far the superior camera when you want to take any zoom or ultrawide photo.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t quite match the iPhone 16 Pro Max in the main camera category, though, and I consistently preferred it to the S24 Ultra. Still, it should be noted the iPhone\u2019s exposure and contrast can still upset the balance of some images, especially in challenging light. This has affected iPhone cameras for several generations, so it is not unique to the 16 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s very interesting is that the iPhone 16 Pro comprehensively beat the Google Pixel 9 Pro in a recent test, proving its top camera credentials. It also showed several improvements over the iPhone 15 Pro. The Galaxy S24 Ultra has been a winner from the start by improving on its predecessor, beating the Google Pixel 8 Pro, and equaling the performance of our favorite Android camera phone, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra.\n\nIt may not be the latest on the market, but the Galaxy S24 Ultra continues to take on the very best camera phones and easily holds its own."
