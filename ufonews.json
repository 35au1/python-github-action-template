        "article_content": "The newly released Silent Hill 2 Remake brings back the Easter egg UFO ending from the original. Follow our guide to learn how to get it!\n\nKonami\u2019s new Silent Hill 2 Remake brings back one of the most iconic and funny secrets from the original game: the UFO Ending. This joke ending requires a bit of work to unlock, but it\u2019s a fun nod to fans of the franchise.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get abducted by aliens and witness Silent Hill 2\u2019s wackiest conclusion, here\u2019s how to do it. Remember that you must have finished the entire game at least once to access it.\n\nWhat is the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake?\n\nThe UFO ending is one of the funniest and most out-of-place things you\u2019ll come across in the Silent Hill 2 Remake.\n\nThe UFO Ending is one of the two joke endings that you can get in the Silent Hill 2 Remake. Just like the original game, this bizarre conclusion is unlocked through some very specific actions you carry out during a New Game Plus run.\n\nThe original game had James Sunderland meeting Harry Mason from the first Silent Hill. In this version, James meets Space James, who uses his model from the original game.\n\nThis version of James reveals that the James you\u2019re playing is just a clone before an alien swoops in and zaps James with a ray gun before abducting him.\n\nIf you\u2019re a longtime fan of the franchise, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s a tradition for the Silent Hill games to feature a fever dream-like UFO ending in each one.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty funny and lighthearted moment that gives you a breathing moment in between the games\u2019 nonstop onslaught of psychological and gruesome horror.\n\nHow to Get the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake\n\nAll you need to do is stare at this shiny object in a few places around town.\n\nTo unlock the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake, you\u2019ll need to follow a few specific steps during your New Game Plus playthrough.\n\nYou need to finish the game at least once. The UFO Ending can only be unlocked in a New Game Plus file, so make sure you\u2019ve wrapped up a full run before attempting this Easter egg.\n\nIn the New Game Plus file, you need to locate the Blue Gem item. It\u2019s the key to triggering the UFO Ending and only appears after your first playthrough, so don\u2019t bother trying to find it during your first run.\n\nOnce you\u2019re in New Game Plus, head to Neely Street in Eastern South Vale. There, you\u2019ll find the Jeweller\u2019s Store, located north of Big Jay\u2019s. Smash through the store window to grab the Blue Gem, which is sitting on top of a jewelry box.\n\nTo trigger the UFO Ending, you\u2019ll need to use the Blue Gem in four specific locations:\n\nSaul Apartments Rooftop (Eastern South Vale)\n\nRosewater Park Pier (Western South Vale)\n\nLakeview Hotel Docks\n\nRoom 312 in Lakeview Hotel\n\nOnce you\u2019ve used the Blue Gem in the first three locations, head to Room 312 in the Lakeview Hotel and inspect the gem there.\n\nTip When you inspect the Blue Gem at each location, it should glow and make alien-like noises.\n\nIf you\u2019ve done everything correctly, the game will instantly cut to the UFO Ending, skipping the final boss fight entirely.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get the \u2018Tinfoil Hat\u2019 trophy, needed as part of getting the Platinum for this game\u2014check out our trophy guide for more information.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it for this Silent Hill 2 ending. With just a tiny bit of effort during your New Game Plus run, you can unlock this weird ending where you seal James\u2019 fate to an eternity in the stars.\n\nStay tuned if you\u2019re looking for more Silent Hill 2 guides or need Silent Hill 2 help with other endings or secrets.

California\n\nCasino.ca found one UFO per 1,075 people, naming the Golden State the top place where people have claimed to \"see\" a UFO, with 36,286 reported sightings since 1974.\n\nA data scientist with Casino.ca says the high number of reported UFO sightings in California may be related to a few reasons.\n\n\"For example, the vastness and diversity of the state's landscapes, which range from expansive deserts to coastal regions \u2014 offer numerous locations where unusual flying objects can be sighted,\" said the data scientist.\n\nA recent NUFORC report from Oct. 5 lists an alleged sighting, with the person saying, \"There were no clouds in sky and no wind. I saw a cloud-shape circle moving quickly in the sky, not too high up.\"\n\n2. Washington\n\nReported in second place, there is one UFO per 1,093 people, finding about 7,125 UFO \"sightings\" in Washington. California\u2019s sightings are 409% more than the state of Washington.\n\nAn alleged sighting took place on Oct. 6, with the witness sharing, \"I was walking out the front door, taking my dog out when I saw a very shiny object high in the sky.\" However, the NUFORC concluded that the claimed sighting was in fact a balloon.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\n3. Florida\n\nIn the Sunshine State, there were more than 11,000 UFO sighting claims since 1974.

        "article_content": "Have you ever heard of Grendizer and Spazer? Grendizer, also known as Goldorak, is a giant monster robot that connects and synchronizes with Spazer, a flying saucer that enables the robot to fly. FYI, the robot and flying saucer are characters in the 1970s Japanese manga and anime series UFO Robot Grendizer. How do I explain this to a watch audience not up to speed with Japanese animation? Think of Louis Abraham Breguet\u2019s world\u2019s first \u201csympathique clock\u201d first presented in 1798. It\u2019s a system consisting of a clock and a pocket watch. When putting the watch in the clock\u2019s cradle, it will automatically reset, adjust, and synchronize with the mother clock. Now you know how the robot and his flying saucer interact, but how did Grendizer end up on the dial of the Tissot PRX?\n\nThere are two possible answers to that question. The first is that it teamed up with Spazer, took off, and perfectly executed a precision landing on the dial of the 40mm watch. The second answer is a bit more lengthy but more realistic. To understand what Grendizer is, please check out the Wikipedia page on the anime series. That\u2019s what I did, and it made me decide not to dive too deep into the complicated world of Duke Fleed, King Vega, and the flying saucer Spazer. Instead, I will just focus on the watch, the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer ref. T137.407.11.041.02.\n\nTissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer \u2014 Who needs a 1970s glow-in-the-dark monster robot on a watch dial?\n\nI need to stop asking questions before answering them. So let me get back to the second possible answer to the previous question: Grendizer appears on the dial of a PRX because the decision-makers at Tissot think manga and anime are cool. The Swiss watch and the Japanese manga and animated TV series originated in the 1970s, creating a timeline-correct connection. The PRX is a retro-hip watch embraced by a large audience. A PRX with a manga robot on the dial appeals to anime fans. I perceive the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer as a clever brand extension constructed to win retro-futurism enthusiasts\u2019 hearts and minds. The Tissot marketing must have done extensive research on the target audience and how big it is.\n\nGrendizer comes with Spazer\n\nI am sure you don\u2019t want a summary of all the technical details of this Grendizer watch because, apart from the styling, it is a 40mm PRX Powermatic 80 model you have been reading about on Fratello for quite a while now. The manga-inspired PRX presents itself with Grendizer\u2019s Super-LumiNova-coated bust on the deep blue dial. The central seconds hand is modeled after the Harken weapon that Grendizer wields, and the robot\u2019s image is engraved on the rotor visible through the transparent case back.\n\nThe Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer landed on my desk, and that was some sort of miracle. Why? Because Grendizer did that without using Spazer. When you buy the watch, though, the box the watch comes in is shaped like Spazer. Maybe this is the coolest feature of the watch. Can the luminescent outline of Grendizer beat the hero\u2019s legendary spacecraft doubling as a box? Maybe not, but the PRX does have some very neat details.\n\nI already mentioned the central seconds hand with its weapon-like counterweight, but there\u2019s also a thematic engraving on the flange. If you angle the watch and look closely, you can read \u201cUFO\u30ed\u30dc \u30b0\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u201d (Y\u016bf\u014d Robo Gurendaiz\u0101), the original Japanese title of the manga series.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer\n\nThe agony of choice is a phenomenon that applies to Tissot\u2019s PRX collection. There are more than plenty of variations to choose from. The Grendizer broadens the collection while simultaneously being a niche product. What I appreciate about the manga-inspired watch is that it doesn\u2019t look too gimmicky. In the dark, the robot presents itself more prominently, but you will only discover his weapon turning around the dial once a minute after close observation. The same goes for the engraving on the flange and the rotor.\n\nThe standard steel versions of the 40mm PRX Powermatic 80 and the versions with the gradient \u201cChameleon\u201d models cost \u20ac775. The PRX UFO Robot Grendizer is a special edition, not a limited one, and costs \u20ac895. You pay extra for the additional lume on the dial and some other details, including Grendizer\u2019s Spazer doubling as a watch box. To be clear, putting the PRX in the box won\u2019t automatically reset, adjust, and synchronize with a mother clock because it\u2019s just a box. And since it is just a box, the watch will also not be able to fly like Grendizer could with Spazer. Anyway, if you, like me, are not into manga, paying \u20ac120 extra doesn\u2019t make much sense, although I do appreciate the execution of the Grendizer theme. So, Fratello-reading manga fans out there, what do you think of the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer? Let me know in the comments."

        "source": "The Conversation",
        "article_content": "Just as calculators took over the tedious number-crunching in maths a few decades ago, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming coding. Take Kyo, an eight-year-old boy in Singapore who developed a simple platform game in just two hours, attracting over 500,000 players.\n\nUsing nothing but simple instructions in English, Kyo brought his vision to life leveraging the coding app Cursor and also Claude, a general purpose AI. Although his dad is a coder, Kyo didn\u2019t get any help from him to design the game and has no formal coding education himself. He went on to build another game, an animation app, a drawing app and a chatbot, taking about two hours for each.\n\nThis shows how AI is dramatically lowering the barrier to software development, bridging the gap between creativity and technical skill. Among the range of apps and platforms dedicated to this purpose, others include Google\u2019s AlphaCode 2 and Replit\u2019s Ghostwriter.\n\nIn another example of the power of these apps, an eight-year-old American girl called Fay built a chatbot that purported to be Harry Potter. She had it up and running in just 45 minutes, at which point it asked if she had heard the rumours about the Deathly Hallows and suggested they discuss it over a butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks.\n\nFor those that already know how to code, numerous AI apps have become incredibly helpful too. At the other extreme from the natural language coding apps described above, tools like Tabnine and GitHub Copilot act as intelligent assistants, predicting and autocompleting code as you type.\n\nAlternatives such as Sourcery and DeepCode go a step further, offering real-time code cleanup, suggesting improvements and fixing vulnerabilities. New tools are emerging weekly, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT Canvas, a new GPT version designed to help with sophisticated coding. Many of these tools can also translate code from one programming language to another, say from JavaScript to Python.\n\nThe productivity gains that these tools offer are revolutionising the software industry. As many as 70% of companies have already adopted the likes of GitHub Copilot, with coders reporting that AI is enabling them to write software that is more reliable and bug free.\n\nBy removing the need to spend so many hours ironing out human errors, coders are able to spend more time focusing on higher value tasks such as designing system architecture and collaborating with colleagues.\n\nIt is also changing the game for university educators like myself as we race to keep up. We\u2019ve been having to rethink teaching materials and also assessment methods, wrestling with how exactly to grade a student\u2019s coding in situations where AI tools are doing much of the work.\n\nToday\u2019s limitations\n\nAs exciting as all this is, AI coding is still in its infancy. At this stage it can only help non-coders to build simple applications or games. It can\u2019t yet oversee big complex IT projects by understanding the big picture in a way that a human coder would.\n\nIt can\u2019t yet invent new ways to solve problems either, and is still more likely to lag in areas like, say, spacecraft navigation that require highly specialised knowledge.\n\nMany tools also don\u2019t write perfect code: a program will often work but won\u2019t be efficient or secure enough for use in the real world. Similarly, AI tools don\u2019t inherently understand the context of the data they process, so may mishandle sensitive information or perpetuate biases present in the data on which they were trained.\n\nFor all these reasons, in professional situations there\u2019s still a need for a coder to make sure that everything is meeting the necessary standards. No doubt in future we may see AI coding tools designed to handle everything from security issues to highly specialised subject matter. Their ability to help non-coders to build apps will also only improve. For now at least, however, AI coding is still amplifying the skills of coders rather than replacing them altogether.\n\nHow to build your own game\n\nAll the same, it\u2019s incredible what you can do with these tools as a non-coder already. Here\u2019s a quick guide to making a simple platform game:\n\nStep 1: Sign up for an AI tool: Create an account with, say, Cursor or AlphaCode 2 and follow the setup instructions. Depending on which tool you choose, you may need to do a quick install. You may also need to install a programming language such as Python, as well as a source code editor such as VS Studio Code 2 \u2013 the coding platform will keep you right on this.\n\nStep 2: Start your game: Open a new project in the tool. Into the prompt, type: \u201cCreate a simple platform game where the platforms are made of sweet treats\u201d.\n\nStep 3: See what it\u2019s like: Click \u201crun\u201d or \u201cpreview\u201d to see what you\u2019ve created (depending on which system you are using, you may have to do this in the source code editor). You should see platforms made of candy or cakes.\n\nStep 4: Make some changes: Let\u2019s say we change the main character into a parrot. Simply type into the prompt: \u201cMake the avatar a green parrot\u201d.\n\nStep 5: Add features: Now type into the prompt: \u201cLet the parrot be controlled by the cursor arrows, insert some sweets for it to collect and add a score counter for how many it has collected\u201d.\n\nAuthor provided\n\nStep 6: Test and tweak: Click \u201crun\u201d or \u201cpreview\u201d again to test the updated game. Make changes by typing things like, \u201cInsert a black crow that will chase the parrot around the screen. If the crow touches the parrot, freeze the screen and display a message in the middle of the screen saying \u2018Too Bad!!!\u2019\u201d. Keep repeating these steps until you\u2019re happy with the results.\n\nStep 7: Get it out there: You might now want to share your game with friends or online via an app store. It must be said that AI coders are not yet doing this well, so you may find this trickier without prior knowledge. One option is to deploy the game online via a free platform such as Zeabur, as explained here."

        "article_content": "A recent incident, described in a personal blog by Sam Mitrovic, shows how AI-powered scam calls are becoming harder to discern. Mitrovic received a series of suspicious notifications and phone calls that mimicked legitimate Google communication\u00e2\u0080\u0094a threat that could have led to the loss of his Google account.\n\nThe events began with a Gmail account recovery attempt notification originating from the United States. This was followed by a missed call from a number displaying \"Google Sydney\" as the caller ID. About a week later, Mitrovic received another account recovery request, again from the United States. And this time, he answered the call from \"Google Sydney,\" which had a polite and professional American voice speaking from an Australian phone number.\n\nThe caller claimed there was suspicious activity on Mitrovic's account, implying unauthorized access from Germany. Mitrovic was told his account data had been downloaded, referencing the earlier account recovery notification. Notably, the phone number used by \"Google Sydney\" appeared in official Google documentation, suggesting the number was legitimate.\n\nStill, Sam asked the caller to prove their identity. The caller sent an email that appeared to be from a Google domain, but upon closer inspection, Mitrovic noticed the email's \"To\" field contained an email address ending in \"InternalCaseTracking.com,\" which is not a Google domain. The caller's voice, characterized as \"too perfect,\" also raised suspicion. Mitrovic, recognizing the potential for an AI-driven scam, hung up the call. After returning home and checking his Google account's recent security activity log, Mitrovic only found his own login sessions. An examination of the email headers revealed that the email originated from an IP address associated with Amazon Web Services (AWS). This finding supports the possibility of the email being sent through a cloud-based platform used by scammers.\n\nGoogle is aware of the issues that are coming from AI scammers and is combating online scams by partnering with the Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA) and DNS Research Federation (DNSRF) to launch the Global Signal Exchange (GSE), a platform for sharing scams and fraud information. Google is also expanding its Cross-Account Protection tool, which helps protect users by sharing security notifications with apps and services linked to their Google accounts. However, this may not be enough because, according to The Lawstreet Journal, these AI companies have been targeting all 2.5 billion Gmail account holders. Google isn't alone either, because even Apple customers are dealing with more advanced scammers.\n\nIt's important to note that AWS itself is not involved in or responsible for fraudulent activities; rather, it is a service that was used. There are plenty of AI apps on the App Store that are used for scams, so it's not going to stop anytime soon. The ability of scammers to mimic human voices and create realistic scenarios will likely make it much harder to distinguish legitimate calls and communications from frauds. So it's better to always be very careful.\n\nSource: Sam Mitrovic"

        "article_content": "Andy Walker / Android Authority\n\nGoogle Search may still be the search engine to rule them all, but it\u2019s no longer the best way to find content online. There\u2019s a plethora of AI search engines and platforms that, I\u2019d argue, do a much better job. I\u2019m not talking about Google\u2019s AI Overviews feature, either.\n\nThey\u2019re incredibly useful for summarizing multiple results instead of listing potential sites where you might find an answer. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve ditched Google on my phone and switched my default search engine on my mobile browsers to AI services like Perplexity, ChatGPT, and others.\n\nWhy AI search engines are superior to Google Search\n\nCalvin Wankhede / Android Authority\n\nMore and more, I\u2019ve found Google Search to fall short of my needs. More recently, the results it provides don\u2019t quite match my intentions or expectations. Traditional search engines, by design, don\u2019t offer you a direct answer to your query \u2014 they provide possible avenues that may lead you to an answer. This extra step is unnecessary. It stunts my workflow, especially when crunched for time.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s 2024, and tools are now available that allow me to circumvent this. Several useful AI chatbots and tools can be accessed using a simple search string, effectively transforming them into AI search engines when accessed through a browser. By leveraging this trick, I use AI tools in my daily browsing regimen more often.\n\nDo you use an AI service as a search engine? 177 votes Yes, I do 40 % I don't yet, but I plan to 36 % No, I don't want to 24 %\n\nSpecific queries, like \u201cHow do I make kimchi?\u201d or \u201cWhat is the best small car for off-road adventures?\u201d no longer provide me with a list of sites that may have the answer. Instead, AI search engines offer a list of steps, candidates, information about ingredients or models, and sources. If I want to know more about the process, I can visit the kimchi recipe on the site it suggests. If I don\u2019t like the recipe, I can ask the AI search engine to suggest others or variations. This process has saved me so much time and faff crafting the perfect search query, and it helps to plug any knowledge gaps I may have.\n\nTraditional search engines, naturally, don't provide you with a direct answer to your query only possible avenues that may lead you to an answer.\n\nAI search engines do the hard work for you. Even if your query isn\u2019t perfect, they\u2019ll still comb through several sources to provide you with an answer to your question rather than a list of websites that may or may not help you.\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nSo, why would I use an AI search engine in a browser instead of just using the native AI app? Well, the web browser is part of my daily workflow on Windows and my Android smartphone. It makes sense to modify (read: improve) that workflow rather than reroute it through a separate app. I admit I have a Perplexity widget on my home screen, but I often forget to use it. It\u2019s just not natural for me, but opening a browser is. Browsers also make it easier to jump to secondary links and tunnel through tertiary links, allowing for more thorough research.\n\nAdditionally, I don\u2019t use just one AI search engine. Web browsers allow you to add and access multiple options from the URL bar, and I make full use of this. I rely on Perplexity to explain topics and ideas, be they a current trend, a technical process, or a specific news story. I\u2019ve already written about how Perplexity is my preferred Google News alternative for this purpose, especially thanks to its Related query suggestions.\n\nAI search engines offer you practical tools beyond simple website discovery.\n\nAI search engines can perform practical tasks from your browser\u2019s URL bar. I use ChatGPT to compare a selection of items online, quickly generate a Tasker recipe, compute complex calculations, create a simple chart, spreadsheet, or table, or process more abstract suggestions. I can\u2019t do any of these through Google Search.\n\nNotably, there\u2019s no need to wait for these AI services and chatbots to launch search engines. Sure, SearchGPT is an upcoming search engine from OpenAI, but you can already use ChatGPT, Perplexity, and You.com through your browser\u2019s URL bar. So, how do you do it?\n\nHow to add AI search engines to Android browsers\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nLet\u2019s start with Mozilla Firefox on Android. This is my Android browser of choice and offers custom search engine additions without any technical tweaks.\n\nHow to add AI search engines to Mozilla Firefox on Android Notably, the process below should be similar for Firefox forks, but I\u2019m using the stable build of vanilla Mozilla Firefox for Android here.\n\nOpen Firefox on your phone. Tap the three-button icon at the bottom right of the screen. Select Settings. Select Search. Tap Manage alternative search engines. Tap + Add search engine.\n\nFill in the following fields: Name and Search string URL. You can find the search string URLs for your favorite AI service below: ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com/?q=%s Perplexity: https://www.perplexity.ai/?q=%s You.com: https://you.com/search?q=%s\n\nTap Save once you\u2019re done. To set it as your default search engine, exit the previous screen, then tap Default search engine. Select your new search engine. You can complete this process multiple times, adding as many AI search engines as you like. Once you set your preferred engine as default, you\u2019ll receive results from your preferred AI service when you enter a search query. I don\u2019t suggest you do this, though. Firefox allows switching between multiple search providers within the search bar (see the final image above), so you can swiftly jump between Google, Perplexity, or ChatGPT as required.\n\nHow to add AI search engines to Cromite on Android Not everyone uses Firefox, so let\u2019s talk about Google\u2019s native browser. Google Chrome on Android does not allow you add custom search engines, making it incompatible with this particular tutorial and for my personal needs. Notably, Chrome isn\u2019t alone here. Other popular Chromium browsers, including Brave, Edge, and Vivaldi, do not have options to add search engines to their Android browser builds, either.\n\nIf you need a Chromium-based browser on Android with custom search engine capabilities, I\u2019d recommend Cromite. It uses similar underpinnings to Google Chrome but focuses on privacy and includes several additional features, like ad blocking. I find it much faster than Chrome, but you will need to install it from third-party repository Github.\n\nOpen Cromite. Tap the three-dot button at the top right of the screen, and select Settings. Tap Search engine. Select Edit search engines. Under the Site Search section, tap Add. Fill in the following fields: Name, Shortcut, and search string URL. You can find the search string URLs for your favorite AI service below: ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com/?q=%s Perplexity: https://www.perplexity.ai/?q=%s You.com: https://you.com/search?q=%s\n\nClick Add when you\u2019re done. You can now use the search engine within Chrome. Better yet, use the Shortcut ahead of your search query to direct your search to your preferred engine. Notably, Cromite isn\u2019t perfect, so some may have objections to using it. However, there are alternatives. Arc Search browser, which recently rolled out to Android, includes Perplexity as a default search option right from the get-go. It\u2019s a much simpler and modern alternative.\n\nHow to add AI search engines to desktop browsers\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nI\u2019ve also made these changes to my desktop browsers, Firefox and Chrome.\n\nHow to add AI search engines to Mozilla Firefox on desktop Adding new search engines on Firefox for desktop is far more complicated than its mobile version, but it\u2019s not impossible. You will need to dig around in the browser\u2019s about:config dashboard first, though. Here\u2019s how to do it.\n\nAndy Walker / Android Authority\n\nOpen Firefox and navigate to about:config in the URL bar. Click Accept the Risk and Continue. In the Search preference name box, type browser.urlbar.update2.engineAliasRefresh and click the + icon. You should now be able to add new search engines to the browser by navigating to Settings > Search > Add under the Search Shortcuts section. Fill in the following fields: Name and Search string URL. You can find the search string URLs for your favorite AI service below: ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com/?q=%s Perplexity: https://www.perplexity.ai/?q=%s You.com: https://you.com/search?q=%s\n\nTap Save once you\u2019re done. To set it as your default search engine, exit the previous screen, then tap Default search engine. Select your new search engine. If you aren\u2019t comfortable with digging through this dashboard, use a Firefox fork. The best option is Zen Browser. This minimalist alternative allows you to add search engines natively.\n\nHow to add AI search engines to Google Chrome on desktop Oddly enough, Google Chrome on desktop makes it easier to add custom search engines than Firefox. Here\u2019s how to do it:\n\nAndy Walker / Android Authority\n\nOpen Google Chrome. Click the three-dot button and select Settings. Select Search engine > Manage search engines and site search. Under the Site search section, click Add. Fill in the following fields: Name, Shortcut, and search string URL. You can find the search string URLs for your favorite AI service below: ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com/?q=%s Perplexity: https://www.perplexity.ai/?q=%s You.com: https://you.com/search?q=%s\n\nClick Add when you\u2019re done. You can now use the search engine within Chrome. Better yet, use the Shortcut ahead of your search query to direct your search to your preferred engine. Notably, Chrome has a nifty Gemini search engine option that allows you to use Google\u2019s chatbot through a shortcut in the URL bar. Before your query, type @gemini in the URL bar, followed by your query. The results will appear in a Gemini chat window.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

        "article_content": "Yvette Fielding's ghostly encounter in her mid-20s transformed her life\n\nUntil she was 26, former Blue Peter presenter Yvette Fielding didn\u2019t believe in the afterlife. But that all changed the night she awoke to find an eerie figure \u00adstanding at the end of the bed in her mother\u2019s house. She tells me: \u201cI awoke in the middle of the night to discover a young, Second World War soldier staring straight at me from the foot of the bed. It was petrifying.\u201d Even more terrifyingly, rather than being vaporous, the youthful figure \u2013 dressed in a brown military uniform with brass buttons, and sporting Brylcreemed hair and a sharp side parting \u2013 appeared to have formand substance. \u201cI burst into tears and ran screaming from the bedroom into my mum\u2019s room,\u201d Yvette, now 55, recalls. \u201cImagine, as a young woman, awaking to discover a man in your room. But although it was like looking at a solid object, he was only there from the waist up \u2013 his top half was hovering. I was sobbing, \u2018There\u2019s a ghost in the house\u2019.\u201d The experience was destined to change the shape of Yvette\u2019s life \u2013 revealing a new direction in her broadcasting career that continues to this day, as well as helping introduce her to her second husband, TV producer Karl Beattie. Most Haunted, the paranormal research series presented by Yvette and a gang of experts, and produced by Karl, is now filming its 26th season. Yvette explains that her compulsion for the paranormal turned from terror into fascination following a grim discovery made after her haunting experience. \u201cMum and I felt compelled to research the young man in uniform,\u201d she tells me. They started by talking to the neighbours. \u201cThere were only five houses in the road, and we discovered that a couple of them had seen exactly the same thing,\u201dshe explains. Things then became even stranger still when they dug deeper and spoke to anolder resident. \u201cBehind the houses was a wood, and beyond that, the Manchester to London \u00adrailway line. \u201cI spoke to a neighbour who said that during the war, the young soldiers were sent south by railway to fight, but one young conscript had thrown himself off the train as he didn\u2019t want to go, and was cut in half by the train.\u201d Convinced that this explained the apparition that had so alarmed her, fearturned into fascination. \u201cThat first-hand experience has now led me on a journey that has become such a huge passion, and it has actually changed my entire life,\u201d Yvette reflects. \u201cBefore this experience, I didn\u2019t believe in anything. I didn\u2019t believe in a God. I didn\u2019t believe in life after death and those feelings affected me in a negative way because when I had the usual share of awful times, as we all do, I would wonder what life is all about, why are we here, where did we come from and is that it when you\u2019re put in the ground at the end and it all goes black?\u201d\n\nYvette Fielding and husband Karl\n\nNow Yvette\u2019s latest children\u2019s book, about haunted castles, has just been published, mining her on-camera experiences and bringing them to life in spooky fashion for a brand new audience of young readers. And it was shortly after meeting Karl that she discovered he had also had a similar experience to her; a fact that proved to be deeply bonding. \u201cWhen I met my beautiful husband, he had had his own haunted experiences,\u201d she tells me. Karl takes over the tale: \u201cOne night, when I was about 10 and my brother was five, I saw a man wearing a fedora hat and dressed in a 1930s costume, leaning on my bedroom door frame.\u201d As with Yvette\u2019s visitor, he was similarly solid but faded over the next few minutes. Says Karl: \u201cI thought I may have dreamed it, but it was only in the morning when we got up for breakfast that my little brother said that he had got really scared in the night because there was a man leaning on the wall in a Humphrey Bogart outfit. He was so young that this detail made me think there had to be some truth to what we had both seen.\u201d When the couple, who have been married for 25 years and have a daughter, Mary, met on the set of BBC One\u2019s documentary series City Hospital, they soon found themselves sharing their experiences. Says Karl: \u201cYvette and I connected on so many levels when we met, and had this sense that we had met each other before and when I talked about this experience, she took me seriously. We were both used to people being sceptical.\u201d Yvette, who also has a son, Will, from a previous marriage, says that this led them to become \u00adincreasingly intrigued to the point that they came up with the idea for the TV series. Sheadds: \u201cWe were so passionate about the topic that we spent all our life savings making the pilot and for a while we couldn\u2019t pay the mortgage.\u201d\n\nTrending\n\nWorryingly, all the mainstream TV \u00adstations turned it down. \u201cChannel 5 even called us \u2018unprofessional\u2019 for delving into this genre,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut something in us kept pushing until the satellite station UK Living said yes.\u201d At the time, the station was losing viewers, but the couple were told \u201cthis might be just mad enough to work\u201d. Sixteen initial episodes were commissioned, and Yvette found herself launched professionally into the world of the paranormal. \u201cWe don\u2019t know all the answers and the only experts are those who have passed on,\u201d she says now. \u201cBut I definitely call myself a paranormal researcher.\u201d And as she gazes into the camera, often in the eerie black and white world created by heat-seeking night vision cameras, she says she never forgets the advice she was given as a 19-year-old presenting rookie by Biddy Baxter, the legendary Blue Peter producer. \u201cOne thing Biddy always said was that it is so important just to be yourself as a presenter. She said, \u2018Never, ever when you look in the camera, think of a lot of people. Just think of one, your best friend, and you are trying to talk to them\u2019.\u201d It\u2019s advice she continues to heed. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important for presenters to remember that. Audiences are not daft, they know who a genuine person is.\u201d\n\nCaron Keating, Mark Curry and Yvette Fielding on Blue Peter in 1995\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This asteroid is categorized as a fragment of rock and metal that orbits the sun.\n\nThe project was led by Ay\u015fe Arslan, a science teacher at D\u00fczce BILSEM who has been engaged in space observation for five years, along with \u00d6mer Selim Esen, a 14-year-old ninth grade student at D\u00fczce Turgut \u00d6zal Anadolu High School. Their work was part of the \"Asteroid Discovery Campaign,\" supported by the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC).\n\nAs part of this initiative, amateur astronomers sought to identify new asteroids. Arslan and Esen successfully detected a celestial body in 2021, which was subsequently registered as a new asteroid by the IASC. This significant discovery also granted them the privilege of naming the asteroid.\n\nSignificance of discovery\n\nAy\u015fe Arslan shared her excitement with Anadolu Agency (AA), noting that after their application to the Asteroid Discovery Campaign was accepted, they began their observations using data sets provided to them. They utilized specialized software to analyze the data and submitted their reports to the Minor Planet Center of the IASC.\n\nAfter three years of awaiting confirmation, they received an email notifying them that the celestial body they discovered was the first asteroid identified by Turkish researchers. Arslan emphasized the scientific value of this discovery, stating, \"The identification of this asteroid marks the first time a celestial body has been discovered in the solar system by Turkish researchers, which is incredibly significant for both us and T\u00fcrkiye.\"\n\n\u00d6mer Selim Esen expressed his pride in their discovery, recalling, \"We discovered this asteroid three years ago. A long time has passed, but I still remember that moment vividly. It is very valuable to me.\" Driven by his curiosity about astronomy, Esen has been involved in various projects at BILSEM for seven years."

Many industries are likely to face stagnation or secular decline, which counter-intuitively may improve business performance if competition decreases. Conversely, other businesses are likely to face rising costs and diseconomies of scale. In addition, economies are becoming increasingly dominated by asset light businesses, and the need for infrastructure investments is declining over time. As a result, a large pool of capital is chasing a limited set of investment opportunities, which is driving up asset prices and compressing risk premia over time.Durant has undergraduate degrees in engineering and finance from the University of Adelaide (Honors) and an MBA from Nanyang Technological University (Dean\u2019s Honors List).

        "article_content": "Startups can qualify for several types of small business loans. As long as you have enough time in business and can meet other requirements, you can use startup loans for a wide range of business goals.\n\nWorking capital loan (business line of credit)\n\nA small business line of credit or \"working capital loan\" can be a great choice for small business startup loans. This type of business loan gives your startup a flexible line of credit that works in the same way as a small business credit card.\n\nMost working capital loans can be paid off in a flexible way (based on the lender's terms). This flexibility is especially important for startup loans, because it can help your growing business conserve cash when you need it, or replenish your available line of credit faster if you choose.\n\nSmall business term loan for startups\n\nWorking capital loans are often available in the form of a flexible revolving line of credit. But if your startup is ready to borrow a larger amount of funding for big goals like purchasing equipment or investing in new facilities, a small business term loan can give your startup long-term cash.\n\nHere's the biggest difference between a small business line of credit and a small business term loan: A small business line of credit is like a credit card, and a term loan is like a mortgage. Because small business term loans tend to have larger loan amounts, fixed monthly payments, and longer durations, term loans might also have more favorable APRs.\n\nSome small business term loans are harder for young companies to qualify for -- your startup might need to have at least two years in business before you can get the best rates on a small business term loan. And many small business term loans require the business owner to offer a personal guarantee, or put up collateral such as equipment or property owned by the business.\n\nSBA loans for startups\n\nSBA loans can be a good choice for startups because they're supported by the Small Business Administration (SBA). This government backing helps make SBA loans available to a wider range of businesses, including newer businesses, that might not qualify for traditional bank business loans. Even startup founders with bad credit can qualify for SBA loans.\n\nBe aware that with SBA loans for startups, the loan amounts might be smaller than you prefer, and the application process is not always fast. It might take a few months for your SBA startup loan application to get reviewed and approved. If your startup needs money sooner, the best fast small business loans for quick funding could be a better choice.\n\nEquipment financing for startups\n\nSome banks and lenders offer special business loans designed for purchasing equipment. Equipment financing for startups can help your company buy new computers, office furniture, machinery for a contracting business, professional kitchen appliances for a restaurant, and any other equipment that your business might need.\n\nSimilar to buying a car with an auto loan, some equipment loans will even use the newly purchased equipment as collateral to secure the loan -- which can help your business qualify for a lower APR."
