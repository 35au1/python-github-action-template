        "article_content": "An office in the Pentagon investigated UFOs\u2014and the paranormal\u2014over a decade ago, segueing into a long saga leading to Congressional hearings and breathless news stories today. But the real story looks more like former defense officials pushing their personal mythology, rather than any cover-up of aliens\n\nAfter a long hiatus of systematic U.S. government\u2013affiliated investigations into UFOs, a Pentagon office quietly resumed such efforts in 2008. Called the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (AAWSAP), it was funded to the tune of $22 million in total. The life\u2014and cancellation four years later\u2014of this Defense Intelligence Agency program has featured in congressional hearings, UFO \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claims and renewed public uproar about aliens. But the real story is more sordid than sensational.\n\nIn 2022 the U.S. Department of Defense established the brand-new and separate All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to investigate military reports of UFOs, now called unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP. Currently AARO offers a unique chance for the government to get this UFO thing right once and for all\u2014but not in quite the way that more hard-line alien believers might wish.\n\nThe new office has its hands full. Last year congressional hearings heard claims of alien technology recoveries and a supposed decades-long cover-up of ET\u2019s presence on Earth. Such assertions fill the new book Imminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt for UFOs, by former military counterintelligence officer Luis Elizondo, attracting renewed notice among podcasters and serious news outlets alike.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nInvestigating these unverifiable fables about aliens should be scrapped as a fool\u2019s errand for AARO, which earlier this year released a historical review demolishing this long-running conspiracy theory. The office\u2019s real value, from a technical standpoint, lies in resolving UFO sighting reports with the very latest technology and tools, supplementing time-honored fact-checking and investigation, and showing how UFOs can be tracked and resolved in real time using high-tech sensors, rather than relying on the suboptimal witness testimonials that fill bookshelves and cable-news specials.\n\nGovernment-themed conspiracy theories have been part of the UFO milieu for decades, but recent testimonies by \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d to congressional committees have given these accounts a hitherto unparalleled air of authenticity. Far from being a scientific sea change, however, as longtime scholars of UFO claims we regard them as having elements closer to religion, with the same core group of advocates\u2014including some former AAWSAP insiders\u2014pushing the \u201cnonhuman intelligence\u201d narrative of hidden aliens or interdimensional beings.\n\nAAWSAP was officially meant to research future aerospace threats but was a de facto UFO/paranormal investigation effort, a fact affirmed in the AARO historical report. Controversy has surrounded the office since the publication of a credulous 2017 New York Times article identified it by the moniker \u201cAdvanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program\u201d (AATIP). The acronym soup confusion regarding the name has been exacerbated by Elizondo, who co-opted the AATIP label for his own, informal follow-on effort at the Pentagon after AAWSAP\u2019s termination in 2012.\n\nAAWSAP\u2019s output included 38 \u201cDefense Intelligence Reference Documents\u201d produced by scientists contracted by mogul and UFO enthusiast Robert Bigelow, along with other reports described in two books. The latter reports reference as-yet unreleased databases of international UFO cases, investigations and findings from the \u201cspooky\u201d Skinwalker Ranch in Utah once owned by Bigelow, and monthly reports supposedly delivered to the DIA, along with a 494-page \u201c10 Month Report\u201d replete with charts, graphs and findings. There are good reasons to harbor doubts about these reports\u2019 quality and objectivity.\n\nElizondo\u2019s effort, despite his countless mass media and podcast appearances, has yielded no publicly accessed findings or deliverables proving any claims about a UFO cover-up. These may come to light, but \u201cAARO assesses that the inaccurate claim that the USG [U.S. government] is reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology and is hiding it from Congress is, in large part, the result of circular reporting from a group of individuals who believe this to be the case, despite a lack of evidence,\u201d that office concluded in its recent report.\n\nThis entire saga shows how pseudoscientific thinking can metastasize in a positive feedback loop, ensnaring not only scientists with paranormal inclinations but also government officials. This was bemoaned by the former head of AARO, Sean Kirkpatrick, who remarked that these officials are tasked with matters of national urgency\u2014a responsibility necessitating a mindset committed to objective investigation and analysis. Some of these officials are on the record casting AARO as part of the \u201ccover-up.\u201d Indeed, the UFO belief system has long ago morphed into a type of faith requiring no evidence.\n\nThe fact that officials harboring evidence-deficient beliefs regarding extraterrestrials and \u201chigh strangeness\u201d (a term first popularized in the early 1970s by ufologists to describe certain bizarre and seemingly absurd elements of some UFO and \u201calien\u201d encounters) are entrusted with national security matters should give one pause. America\u2019s adversaries, to the extent that they are paying attention to the UFO mess, might well regard it as yet another avenue to undermine American institutions\u2014somewhat reflecting a CIA panel\u2019s 1953 warning about potential Soviet exploitation of the genre.\n\nOn a more positive note, ufology is now in vogue among historians keen to understand the mythical nature of the problem and how it relates to historical waves of aerial phenomena reports. Because of how modern media, and especially now digital media, magnify the voices of breathless advocates, sundry frauds and scientists with a penchant for the paranormal, the UFO phenomenon from 1947 onward has acquired much greater gravitas than prior scares and waves, some of which predate it by centuries.\n\nMany serious people dismiss UFOs as a fringe interest or a pop culture distraction. Yes, they are. Yet we maintain, along with an increasing number of scholars, that there is much to be learned from studying UFO sightings, flaps and waves. While our own view is that UFOs, or UAP, emphatically do not represent any truly anomalous physical phenomena such as an extraterrestrial presence, this nevertheless does not consign ufology to insignificance. We should explore its meaning rather than ceding it to sensationalistic advocates employing shoddy methodologies and pushing quasi-religious, otherworldly stories. AARO and academia are thus tasked with an important responsibility that could yield original and fascinating developments into how and why people interpret and react to things they see in the sky.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

Earlier this month, it was reported that the Senate Armed Services Committee is looking to hold a UFO hearing after the elections in November.\n\nThe doc, narrated by Peter Coyote, will include extensive interviews with insiders, experts and politicians. Christopher Mellon, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, and Stanford University\u2019s Dr. Gary Nolan, will be among those who appear in the doc. Also set are Jason Sands, a master sergeant in the United States Air Force; Craig Lindsay, formerly of Scotland\u2019s Royal Air Force Office; and Nick Pope, formerly of the U.K.\u2019s Ministry of Defense. Among others, Andre Carson, Sen. Harry Reid and Rep. Tim Burchett are interviewed, along with Kirk McConnell, who previously held a position in Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nFox and Lance Mungia produced the doc, with Jim Martin and Henry Marx of Lab 9 Films executive producing. Verve Ventures is handling sales, with the doc set to screen for buyers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been making films on the topic of UFOs (now referred to as UAP) since the early 1990s. I never thought I\u2019d live to see the day when high level military officials would testify under oath to a bipartisan group of lawmakers that the United States government has been hiding definitive proof that we are not alone. The program lays out a very compelling case that disclosure is upon us,\u201d said Fox, who was behind previous docs The Phenomenon and Moment of Contact.\n\nAdded Martin and Marx: \u201cWe are thrilled to bring James Fox\u2019s most powerful work, The Program, to the widest possible audience. This film is banging on the door of UFO disclosure, demanding the attention and conversation it deserves.\u201d\n\nThe conversation about UFOs/UAPs is heating up as top officials continue to share their stories. Recently, Jay Stratton, the former director of the U.S. government\u2019s secretive Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, struck a memoir deal with HarperCollins. Last month, Luis Elizondo \u2014 the former head of the Pentagon\u2019s program investigating UFOs/ UAPs \u2014 released the book Imminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt for UFOs, which became a New York Times best-seller."

Using the AI-powered app, vehicle owners will be able to search their owners\u2019 manuals by simply posing a question, such as \u201cHow do I change a tire?\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s integration of generative AI into its app could help improve the overall customer experience, generating brand loyalty and an avenue to learn more about driver behavior.\n\nManufacturer-created apps have become a major part of the modern auto-ownership experience. According to JD Power, nearly three-quarters of traditional, internal-combustion car owners use original equipment manufacturer apps to accomplish tasks like remote start, locking and unlocking their cars, addressing diagnostic problems and interacting with dealerships. That percentage goes up to 90% for electric-vehicle owners.\n\nVolkwagen\u2019s enhanced app uses Google\u2019s AI tools, including Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex and BigQuery, to create Gemini models for multiple data sources, including owners\u2019 manuals, frequently asked questions, help center articles, official Volkswagen YouTube videos and step-by-step guides. The app\u2019s interface will enable users to ask simple questions, like how to change a tire or to provide information on a dashboard indicator light. Multi-modal capabilities in the app will enable users to get information on indicator lights by simply pointing their smartphone cameras at their vehicle dashboards.\n\n\u201cThe myVW mobile app helps us advance our promise of unparalleled customer service and exceptional value for our Volkswagen vehicle owners,\u201d said Rachael Zaluzec, senior vice president of customer experience and brand marketing for Volkswagen Group of America, in a statement. \u201cThe myVW app and Virtual Assistant effectively bring a collection of different points of information into one place, giving our owners the support they value from Volkswagen.\u201d\n\nAs interest and investment in generative AI surges, Google has integrated its new tools through collaborations with a range of brands and agencies. Google in April announced a partnership with WPP that combines the tech company's generative AI tools with the agency holding company's proprietary marketing and advertising data. Previously, the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies deepened its relationship with Google Cloud to include more applications of generative AI."

Learn More\n\nAs companies struggle to realize returns on massive investments in artificial intelligence, Airtable is betting it can help enterprises finally deploy AI into critical business workflows at scale.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company announced on Thursday new capabilities that transform its collaborative app-building platform into what it calls a \u201ctrue enterprise-grade AI platform.\u201d\n\nThe additions include App Library, which allows companies to create standardized AI-powered applications that can be customized across an organization, and HyperDB, which enables integration of massive datasets of over 100 million records.\n\nAirtable\u2019s new App Library feature, showcasing pre-built applications like \u201cLaunch tracker\u201d and \u201cOKR tracker.\u201d The interface allows users to search and browse apps by category, illustrating Airtable\u2019s push to make AI-powered business tools more accessible to enterprise users. (Credit: Airtable)\n\nAI deployment: Moving beyond chatbots to workflow automation\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been way too much emphasis on just the hard tech, and not nearly enough emphasis on the ergonomics and how to actually utilize LLMs today,\u201d said Howie Liu, Airtable\u2019s co-founder and CEO, in an interview with VentureBeat. He argued that while there\u2019s been fascination with ever-larger AI models, the focus needs to shift to deploying AI in real business use cases.\n\nThe move positions Airtable to capitalize on surging enterprise interest in generative AI. Goldman Sachs forecasts $1 trillion in AI investments from tech firms, corporations and utilities in coming years. But many early AI initiatives have failed to deliver tangible business impact.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point in the AI era, yet most enterprise AI adoption is still just scratching the surface of the powerful potential that could transform digital operations,\u201d the company said in its announcement.\n\nAirtable\u2019s new enterprise AI platform aims to integrate AI capabilities across business operations. The platform features AI-embedded apps, tools for citizen developers, and centralized governance, highlighting Airtable\u2019s strategy to make AI deployment more accessible and manageable for large organizations. (Credit: Airtable)\n\nBalancing standardization and customization: The Enterprise AI challenge\n\nAirtable claims its platform is already used by major media, retail and financial services companies to power critical operations. One unnamed \u201cleading streaming company\u201d reportedly saved 280 hours per week on content genre classification using custom AI solutions built on Airtable.\n\nThe new enterprise offerings aim to strike a balance between standardization and customization \u2014 a common challenge for global organizations. App Library allows central teams to create standardized applications with embedded AI that can then be adapted by different business units.\n\n\u201cWe give them a Lego kit, and we make the technology really accessible,\u201d Liu said, emphasizing Airtable\u2019s focus on empowering business users rather than just technical teams.\n\nHyperDB, meanwhile, is designed to make massive datasets from systems like Snowflake and Salesforce more accessible for use in departmental applications while maintaining centralized governance.\n\nAirtable\u2019s new AI-powered platform orchestrates complex media production lifecycles, from strategic planning to performance measurement. The system integrates data from millions of titles and over 100 million users to streamline processes across global markets, showcasing the potential scale of AI application in enterprise media operations. (Credit: Airtable)\n\nScaling AI: From chat interfaces to parallel processing of thousands of tasks\n\nAirtable faces competition from established enterprise software vendors racing to embed AI capabilities, as well as a crop of AI-native startups. But Liu believes Airtable\u2019s approach of enabling parallel deployment of AI across thousands of records or workflow steps is differentiated.\n\n\u201cIt would be like, could you hire overnight and just for five minutes worth of work, 10,000 decently smart interns to go work on a task,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a really powerful kind of form factor.\u201d\n\nThe moves come as Airtable, valued at $11 billion in late 2021, navigates a more challenging funding environment for tech startups. The company laid off about 250 employees last year and is reportedly preparing for a potential IPO.\n\nAirtable\u2019s enterprise push represents a significant pivot from its roots as a user-friendly collaborative spreadsheet tool. While the company has successfully built a large user base with its grassroots adoption strategy, competing in the enterprise market presents new challenges. Airtable will need to prove it can handle the complex security, compliance, and integration requirements of large organizations.\n\nThis strategic shift positions Airtable in direct competition with tech giants like Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow, all of which are rapidly integrating AI into their offerings. Airtable\u2019s success will likely depend on whether its approach\u2014empowering business users to create AI-enhanced applications\u2014can deliver tangible productivity gains more efficiently and cost-effectively than solutions from established vendors.\n\nAs enterprises grapple with how to extract value from their AI investments, Airtable\u2019s platform could find a receptive audience. However, the company will need to clearly articulate its differentiation and ROI proposition to stand out in an increasingly crowded market for enterprise AI solutions.\n\nIn the end, Airtable\u2019s ambitious leap from organizing data to orchestrating AI may just prove that in the world of enterprise software, the best way to think outside the box is to rebuild it entirely."

        "article_content": "A new artificial intelligence-powered music remixing app called Hook launched for iOS devices on Wednesday (September 25).\n\nDeveloped by a team led by CEO Gaurav Sharma, the app allows users to create short-form remixes and mashups of popular songs using AI. Its launch on iOS comes after the startup raised $3.5 million in funding earlier this year. It counts Natalie Massenet, Nick Brown\u2019s Imaginary Ventures (SKIMS, Daily Harvest, Glossier), Point72 Ventures and Edgar Bronfman Jr.\u2019s Waverley Capital among its backers.\n\nHook provides users with a library of licensed music clips and AI tools to create up to 30-second clips. Users can apply various effects to the songs, including genre transformations, tempo changes, and mashups with other tracks. The app also lets users add visuals, allowing them to create shareable multimedia content.\n\nHook says it seeks to solve the challenges creators face when making their own versions of songs. The startup said creators used to rely on complex music production software to produce their own versions of songs. When these unauthorized versions were posted on social media, no one was compensated\u2014not the original artist, the creator, or other rights holders who deserved payment.\n\n\u201cHook is designed to solve all of these issues by providing a simple, intuitive app that allows anyone to make great-sounding custom remixes while also ensuring that artists and everyone else involved in the creation of the track are fairly compensated,\u201d Hook said.\n\nGaurav Sharma, Founder and CEO of Hook, described its launch as \u201ca proud moment\u201d for the company.\n\n\u201cHook redefines how fans connect with the music they love, turning music listening into an active canvas for creativity. For artists, this opens up entirely new horizons for expanding their influence and unlocking untapped revenue streams. We\u2019re thrilled to lead the evolution of music expression and creativity, and we can\u2019t wait for the world to experience music through Hook,\u201d he said.\n\nLast month, Hook partnered with Downtown Music to bring potentially millions of Downtown\u2019s tracks to the app and open up a new revenue stream for Downtown-linked artists.\n\nHook\u2019s launch comes as the music industry grapples with AI\u2019s increasing role in music creation. While the app promises to ensure fair compensation for artists and rights holders, details of the compensation model have yet to be clarified.\n\nEarlier this year, major music companies launched RightsAndAI.com to push for stricter copyright regulations and prevent unauthorized use of their music by AI. In June, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group\u2019s UMG Recordings, and Warner Records Inc. filed lawsuits against AI music generators Suno and Udio for alleged mass infringement of copyrighted recordings.\n\nIn August, UMG struck a strategic agreement with an AI startup called ProRata to attribute and compensate content owners. ProRata, which raised $25 million in a Series A round for its tech, also plans to launch a \u201csubscription AI chatbot\u201d or \u201cAI answer engine\u201d that will showcase the company\u2019s attribution technology.Music Business Worldwide"

        "article_content": "Developer Perfectly Paranormal has done it again with The Holy Gosh Darn, a narrative-driven adventure that\u2019s packed with humour and more than just a dash of blasphemy. The company\u2019s first game, Manual Samuel, is one of my personal favourites, and while I didn\u2019t enjoy the follow-up, Helheim Hassle, quite as much, it still packed in that PP charm. But The Holy Gosh Darn is absolutely on-point: it\u2019s brilliantly written, it looks fantastic, and it\u2019s a joy to play.\n\nI should say that you don\u2019t have to have played either of Perfectly Paranormal\u2019s previous games before jumping into The Holy Gosh Darn. It\u2019s its own unique story with a new protagonist \u2014 but Death, who you\u2019ll be familiar with if you\u2019ve played Manual Samuel, has a key role here. You\u2019ll see lots of other familiar faces too, so it\u2019s safe to say you\u2019ll get a lot more out of it if you\u2019re already acquainted with the, er, Perfectly Paranormal-verse. Samuel has a cameo, and Helheim Hassle\u2019s Bj\u00f8rn and Pesto show up at some point too.\n\nThe Holy Gosh Darn is a puzzle game at heart, with some elements that feel like a traditional point-and-click game. The main focus here, however, is that you have time control powers. You see, at precisely 6pm, Heaven is going to explode. Naturally, that can\u2019t happen and, as an angel, it\u2019s fallen to you to try and fix it. You\u2019ve got six hours to do so \u2014 and with a time-control device loaned to you by Death, you can jump forwards and backwards in time as often as you like.\n\nImage: Perfectly Paranormal\n\nProgress through The Holy Gosh Darn a little, and you\u2019ll find that you can upgrade your time travelling device, too. Normally, rewinding time will see you lose any items you picked up before travelling backwards. But eventually you\u2019ll be able to bring an item with you, cutting out valuable time. Because in this world, even getting the simplest item can be quite a task.\n\nJust to get a pen, I had to descend to Earth, infiltrate a company business meeting to steal an employee\u2019s pass then break into a storage cupboard. Store that pen inside your device, and it\u2019ll cut out the need to do that every time. (Later, I found a pen in the room right next door to where I was\u2026 but that\u2019s beside the point.)\n\nAnd with only six hours to go, every second counts, so you\u2019ll need to shave off time everywhere you can. That means cutting chit-chat with well-meaning passers-by and keeping conversations with everyone as brief as possible. You\u2019ve got to be careful, though: be too hasty and you\u2019ll come off as rude. And nobody wants to help a rude person out.\n\nEvery character in The Holy Gosh Darn is fully voiced \u2014 and to an impeccably high standard. I\u2019m a little annoyed that Death isn\u2019t quite the same character as he was in Manual Samuel, but he\u2019s still hilarious. The writing is absolutely on-point, and I can\u2019t think of a single example of a joke not landing here. It isn\u2019t afraid to be blasphemous for humour\u2019s sake, either: if you\u2019ve got a problem with God being called a jerk, you might want to sit this one out.\n\nImage: Perfectly Paranormal\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of back-and-forth, given the time-travelling nature of The Holy Gosh Darn. But somehow, it\u2019s handled in such a way that it never feels too repetitive. The way your conversations can be shortened down on returning visits, for example, really helps the experience feel dynamic, even if you are simply going through the same motions for the third or fourth time. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to, because the story calls for it. But other times it may be because you\u2019ve made a mistake; maybe you\u2019ve gone all the way to Helheim and left your Heaven-money in your other jeans. What an idiot.\n\nThat\u2019s the puzzly nature of The Holy Gosh Darn, though. Sometimes there\u2019s an element of trial-and-error, and remembering the steps you need to take to achieve a certain outcome is part of the fun. Getting into the VIP lounge of a tabletop gaming bar, for example, means having a demon disguise, enough money to buy gaming tokens and the knowledge of how to win at a particular TTRPG. You may have had to rewind time a few times to get all the pieces just right, but when it all comes together, it feels like sweet, sweet success.\n\nI feel like Perfectly Paranormal has learned a lot from making Manual Samuel and Helheim Hassle, and that experience really shows in The Holy Gosh Darn. It\u2019s clear the team is aware of what has and hasn\u2019t worked in its previous games, and has put in only the best bits here. It\u2019s not perfect, no, but it\u2019s a gosh darn good adventure that\u2019s well worth your attention."

Nosferatu was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker\u2019s 1891 novel Dracula, and tells the story of the vampire Count Orlok as he prays on a woman named Ellen and her husband, Thomas, must save her before sunrise. The film was banned due to its \u201cexcessive horror\u201d and as a result, nearly all copies of the film were destroyed under court order, except for one.

DOI: 10.15184/aqy.2024.143\n\nNew University of Otago\u2014\u014ct\u0101kou Whakaihu Waka research has uncovered the unlikely location of one of the earliest securely dated sites of sweet potato (k\u016bmara) cultivation in Polynesia.\n\nThe study, published in Antiquity, found evidence of microscopic k\u016bmara starch granules alongside Asia-Pacific taro and Pacific yam (uwhi) at Triangle Flat in Golden Bay (Mohua) that were cultivated as early as AD 1290\u20131385.\n\nThese early dates correspond with the period during which settlement of Aotearoa New Zealand began and provide the first pre-1400 evidence for k\u016bmara cultivation in Te Waipounamu\u2014as early as anywhere else in Polynesia\u2014and for the southernmost world attempt to grow uwhi.\n\nThe site is on a conservation estate under the customary jurisdiction of Manawhenua ki Mohua.\n\nLead author Professor Ian Barber, from Otago's Archaeology Program, says the site incorporates evidence of the longest duration of m\u0101ra (garden) conservation from a single place anywhere in Polynesia.\n\n\"The earliest m\u0101ra pits incorporating k\u016bmara-like starch at Triangle Flat date to the beginning of the fourteenth century when Polynesians first settled the motu.\"\n\nDespite its importance to Polynesian life both in the past and today, little is known about the timing and circumstances of the sweet potato's initial spread across Oceania.\n\nSome botanists propose it drifted naturally into Polynesia thousands of years ago, but many anthropologists infer undated human mediation instead, especially since the M\u0101ori name k\u016bmara is a variation on pre-Columbian American sweet potato names.\n\nGiven these uncertainties and intriguing possibilities, scholars have debated exactly when, and even if, sweet potato became important in early Polynesian colonization, Professor Barber says.\n\nExisting views have assumed the first settlers turned instead to forage for the flightless moa, other birds and marine animals, with k\u016bmara only becoming important later, especially in warmer areas central to northern Aotearoa New Zealand where p\u0101 earthworks proliferated.\n\n\"The Otago research now challenges standard archaeological assumptions that the first Polynesian settlers of Aotearoa, and Te Waipounamu especially, abandoned tropical horticulture largely if not entirely.\n\n\"The new Triangle Flat evidence points to the early adaptation of tropical crops, especially k\u016bmara, from the outset of Polynesian settlement, even in unlikely places.\n\n\"In short, k\u016bmara was not a colonization after-thought in Aotearoa.\"\n\nThe early chronology supports those M\u0101ori traditions that speak of k\u016bmara as a crop established in the central Polynesian homeland, Hawaiki, when the first voyagers ventured south for Aotearoa.\n\nCo-author Rebecca Waikuini Benham (Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa, Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ng\u0101ti Awa), from Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, was responsible for preparing the microscopic starch granule samples.\n\nThis important microbotanical science has been used to identify ancient crops throughout Polynesia, including Aotearoa, that may leave no other traces.\n\nShe says Aotearoa offers a unique case study when compared to the other Polynesian Islands.\n\n\"There are significantly fewer starch producing crops that were cultivated here than compared to the more tropical islands.\n\n\"I am hopeful that the identification of granules, along with the possible raphides, may be able to be applied to other early sites across the motu to investigate the cultivation of taro and uwhi alongside k\u016bmara from an archaeological perspective, of course in collaboration with local k\u014drero.\"\n\nThe study also demonstrates that the first Aotearoa gardeners developed sophisticated planting pit and shell mulch technologies in local environments and soils, which helped secure k\u016bmara horticulture in a marginal climate.\n\nCurrently, sweet potato is the world's fifth most important edible crop but is under threat from climate and other environmental changes in many parts of the world, Professor Barber says.\n\n\"New knowledge from the past as well as the present may yet support food security science targeting sweet potato production.\n\n\"Archaeological knowledge of these ancient technologies might yet inform modern efforts to improve natural hardiness and nutrition in sweet potato.\"\n\nMore information: Ian G.

This unusual \"zebra rock,\" characterized by its striking black-and-white striped pattern, could indicate exciting new findings in the ongoing exploration of Mars. The discovery was detailed in a recent blog post by the US space agency.The Perseverance Rover, which landed in Jezero Crater in February 2021, captured images of this unique rock earlier this month using its high-mounted camera. While navigating the relatively plain pebbly terrain, the rover team noticed the rock in low-resolution images, describing it as having \"hints of an unusual texture.\" The team stated, \"The science team thinks that this rock has a texture unlike any seen in Jezero Crater before, and perhaps all of Mars.\"Freya Castle measures approximately 20 cm across and displays alternating black and white stripes. According to NASA, it is a loose stone that differs significantly from the surrounding bedrock. The agency suggested that the rock likely originated from a different location, possibly having rolled downhill from a higher source. NASA noted, \"This possibility has us excited, and we hope that as we continue to drive uphill, Perseverance will encounter an outcrop of this new rock type so that more detailed measurements can be acquired.\"Currently, the Perseverance Rover is ascending the steep slopes of Jezero Crater, where it has been searching for rocks that may reveal insights into Mars' ancient history. This new discovery comes as the rover embarks on its fifth science campaign, known as the Crater Rim Campaign. It aims to uncover signs of ancient life and gather clues about the early conditions on the Red Planet.Perseverance has previously identified ancient lake sediments that might contain microbial fossils, showcasing the potential for groundbreaking discoveries during its mission. As the rover continues its exploration, the scientific community eagerly anticipates further findings related to the intriguing \"zebra rock\" and its implications for understanding Mars' geological history."

While it\u2019s known that \u201cforever chemicals\u201d have become ubiquitous in the natural world, the researchers behind the discovery have described it as \u201cshocking\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAn international team of scientists collected air from a 325-meter-tall (1,066-foot) tower extending far above the Brazilian Amazon's forest canopy.\n\nWithin the samples, they discovered high levels of PFAS, or per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, synthetic chemicals used in a variety of everyday products, from food packaging and cookware to fabrics and cosmetics.\n\nOwing to their durability, PFAS persist in the environment indefinitely, hence the nickname \u201cforever chemicals\u201d. They contaminate much of the world\u2019s water supply and have been found across most natural environments, including Antarctica and the rainwater of Tibet.\n\nHowever, the researchers were particularly surprised by their latest findings in the Amazon rainforest, considered to be a wild environment relatively far removed from intense human activity.\n\nWhat was most unusual was levels of PFAS were highest at the top of the tower, indicating that they might have originated far away but are being transported long distances.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe collected samples right at the top of the tower and also at tree canopy level \u2013 about 42 metres [137 feet]. What was shocking to us was that we saw PFAS - we didn\u2019t expect to and we also saw more at the top of tower,\u201d Dr Ivan Kourtchev, lead study author from the Centre for Agroecology, Water and Resilience at Coventry University, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIf PFAS were to be locally emitted, they should be found lower down the tower. This means PFAS were long-range transported and have been brought from somewhere. It was very puzzling to us,\u201d he added.\n\nThe impact of PFAS is only just starting to be uncovered \u2013 but it\u2019s highly unlikely they form part of a healthy, balanced diet. Studies have linked the chemicals to a host of negative human health effects, including liver damage, thyroid disease, obesity, fertility issues, and cancer.\n\nThey are also likely to impact wildlife in a negative way, which is especially worrying for a rich environment like the Amazon rainforest that\u2019s filled with endangered biodiversity.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe Amazon is a place of unique vegetation and wildlife, so these PFAS can have an impact on that. When our body confuses this chemical with our hormones we can become infertile and if you have some unique animals or vegetation affected, that could stop their reproduction. In sensitive ecosystems with rare or endangered species, such disruptions can have devastating effects on biodiversity and species survival. PFAS could also adversely affect the health of people living in the rainforest,\" explained Dr Kourtchev.\n\nThe new study is published in the journal Science of The Total Environment."

Learn More\n\nJust as enterprises continue to adopt large language model-powered text-to-SQL as a way to \u2018talk\u2019 to their data assets, a new shift in the ecosystem has started emerging: AI agents. Today, New York-based Redbird announced a new chat platform that uses \u201cspecialist agents\u201d to help enterprises handle most analytics value chain tasks, from data collection and engineering to data science and producing actual insights (reporting).\n\nThis means an enterprise user can give a natural language prompt to get insights from data in almost real-time and execute analytical efforts that pave the way for those insights. According to Erin Tavgac, the co-founder and CEO of the company, this represents more than 90% of an enterprise\u2019s business intelligence efforts.\n\n\u201cFor the past several decades the promise of truly self-serve analytics has fallen short for organizations, with the reality instead being complex data pipelines, dashboards, and shadow analytics that require technical skills. We have invested significant R&D into fusing the power of LLMs with Redbird\u2019s robust end-to-end analytical toolkit in the form of AI agents that enable users to finally achieve self-serve, conversational BI that runs on their organization\u2019s data,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nMoving into the age of AI agents\n\nWhile the age of AI agents is new, Redbird itself has been a long-standing player in the analytics domain. The company started in 2018 as Cube Analytics and provided enterprises with a no-code, drag-and-drop toolkit that enabled their users to create workflows aimed at automating and unifying all analytical tasks leading to dashboarding and insights. Earlier this year, the company expanded this work with the launch of a conversational interface, allowing users to ask business questions in natural language and receive insights and reporting outputs in real-time.\n\nNow, as the next step, Redbird has added an ecosystem of specialized agents that operate on top of this end-to-end toolkit to orchestrate as well as execute multi-step analytical tasks to answer business-related questions.\n\nAs Tavgac explained, admins setting up the chat platform have to choose a base LLM (like GPT, Llama etc) and load up their organization\u2019s proprietary data ontologies, business logic and reporting blueprints (like business definitions, PowerPoint report templates, etc.) to customize it with relevant business context. Once the data is inputted, the AI agents using the LLM begin to use all the context and generate metadata from the information to do their work \u2014 in response to user questions.\n\n\u201cUser prompts are sent to Redbird routing agents, which identify the best specialist agents to execute the tasks for that prompt (like PowerPoint Reporting agent, Data Engineering agent, etc.) and figure out how to orchestrate the execution order of those agents. Each specialist agent then manages its own part of the overall task by identifying relevant datasets/ontologies and executing the needed task using the Redbird toolkit, which includes applications and functions to handle the mechanical steps of the pipeline,\u201d Tavgac noted.\n\nDetailing the tasks, he noted Redbird agents can pull unstructured or structured data from over 100 data sources, including Snowflake, Databricks and Hubspot. It can run advanced processing on top of the collected data by performing data wrangling, AI-driven tagging and data science modeling. It can also generate robust reporting outputs (like presentations, Excel reports and email/Slack updates) while taking necessary actions based on those reports (like executing an ad buy/modifying a campaign).\n\n\u201cOnce the task is executed, the chat platform responds to the user with not just a text answer but also any deliverables needed, like a PowerPoint report the agents built or the data that they collected from a SaaS system,\u201d he said.\n\nRedbird Platform Screenshot \u2013 AI Chat (Marketing Analytics)\n\nNo-code workflow orchestration remains available\n\nAs enterprises double down on their data efforts, going beyond text-to-SQL \u2014 adopted by Dremio, Snowflake and many others \u2013 and streamlining the analytics pipeline end-to-end with AI agents could be a great way to save time and resources.\n\nHowever, as many may still have concerns over the reliability of AI agents, Redbird is not doing away with its original drag-and-drop interface for automating business intelligence workflows. Instead, the company has made no-code the secondary option for users. The agents will orchestrate the tasks while also creating a no-code version of the workflow, allowing users to audit and inspect everything in detail if required.\n\n\u201cSo far, existing AI solutions have primarily tackled the automation of a very small fraction of BI and analytics efforts (SQL querying). While Redbird values and solves for that use case (text-to-SQL), it is also applying the power of its AI agents to automate the other more difficult and more sizable parts of enterprise BI workflows\u2026 Our approach to solving this challenge has enabled us to onboard eight of the Fortune 50 brands and over 30 mid-to-large-sized enterprise customers in the last few months,\u201d Tavgac added. This includes brands like Mondelez International, USA Today, Bobcat Company and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nCurrently, he said the company is offering its technology on a SaaS model with usage-based licensing fees and generating seven-figure revenue. However, he did not share the exact specifics.\n\nAs the next step, Redbird will continue its AI agent-driven work and take its new Chat platform to more enterprises. It also plans to add more advanced agents in the analytics value chain to enable even deeper AI-powered business intelligence coverage for non-technical users.\n\n\u201cWe also aim to expand beyond our primary focus on analytics / BI use cases and into a deeper \u2018Large Action Model\u2019 approach that leverages AI agents that can take more nuanced action based on the analytical results (i.e. purchase supplies, send invoices)."

Both CRM, as well as \u201cSoftware as a Service\u201d (SaaS), have since become synonymous with a San Francisco software management company that has become an industry behemoth, even taking \u201cCRM\u201d as its stock ticker.\n\nSalesforce Inc. (NYSE: CRM) is the world\u2019s largest provider of cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) services. Its SaaS platforms bridge the gap between companies and customers around the world, facilitating and personalizing sales management, customer service, and marketing. Its acquisitions of complementary software companies have filled gaps demanded by its customers, and have subsequently fueled Salesforce\u2019s extraordinary growth over the past decade.\n\nGrowth History Summary\n\nMUNGKHOOD STUDIO / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrom fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2024 (January 2024), Salesforce\u2019s revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24%. Although a good part of the growth came from organic, big acquisitions \u2014 including Demandware, Mulesoft, Tableau, and Slack. These additions contributed substantially to expand the Salesforce ecosystem. After going into the black in fiscal 2017, Salesforce\u2019s net income continued to expand, notching a 44% CAGR from 2017 to 2024. The company also announced a $10 billion stock buyback and its first-ever dividend in 2024.\n\nChallenges\n\nRed Fox studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough it was one of the earliest players in the CRM and SaaS arena, Salesforce would inevitably see competition, and not just from start-ups, as well as internal issues.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Dynamics 365 software for CRM challenges Salesforce head-to-head. Other rivals include Oracle\u2019s NetSuite, SAP, HubSpot, Zendesk, Insightly, and a dozen more.\n\nAs Salesforce has also entered the rapidly shifting AI rodeo, it has to devote considerable resources to its development and synchronous compatibility with its current products while keeping an eye on any industry of rivals\u2019 breakthroughs.\n\nActivist investors are pressuring management to cut costs and pause its big acquisitions.\n\nRegardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it\u2019s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further looking insights based on Salesforce Inc.\u2019s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers\u2019 own research.\n\nKey Points In This Article\n\nSalesforce sees currently untapped international emerging markets as fertile ground for future growth.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s Einstein AI solutions suite, its DataCloud and other new tech developments are foundational platforms and future developments are anticipated.\n\nQuantum Technology is also in Salesforce\u2019s R&D purview. Salesforce made an investment in quantum technology as a part of quantum sensing vendor Q-CTRL\u2019s $27.4 million series B extension funding in Jan. 2023.\n\nSalesforce also invested in Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQC), a UK-based company specializing in quantum software and quantum computing, in May 2023.\n\n24/7 Wall Street has a free report to read on what may be \u201cthe next Nvidia\u201d if you click here .

Starting in mid-2013, the company spent $2.5 billion for ExactTarget, which supplied cloud marketing tools to integrate Salesforce management technology with digital marketing campaigns.\n\n2016 saw the $2.8 billion purchase of Demandware, now rebranded as Salesforce CommerceCloud. It is the company\u2019s e-commerce platform, fully integrated with Einstein AI. The need to sync the different cloud based operations and data metrics was satisfied by the $6.5 billion acquisition of MuleSoft for digital integration in 2018. Analytics software platform Tableau followed in 2019 for $15.7 billion. Finally, intraoffice and company personnel collaboration and communication platform Slack was added to Salesforce in 2021 for the sum of $27.7 billion.\n\nThe large expenditures have benefitted Salesforce\u2019s growth but have understandably made earnings erratic, which has raised the ire of some activist investors.\n\nFiscal Year (Jan. 31) Price Revenues Net Income 2016 $68.08 $6.667B (-$47.4M) 2017 $79.10 $8.437B $323M 2018 $113.91 $10.540B $360M 2019 $151.97 $13.282B $1.110B 2020 $182.31 $17.098B $126M 2021 $225.56 $21.252B $4.072B 2022 $232.63 $26.492B $1.444B 2023 $167.97 $31.352B $208M 2024 $281.09 $34.857B $4.136B 2024 (LTM) $252.90 $36.465B $5.632B\n\nKey Drivers for Salesforce Inc.\u2019s Future\n\nTippaPatt / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinancial Health : Salesforce has a strong $8.24 billion net cash surplus position relative to debt.\n\nBrand Strength : Salesforce is the current CRM \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d and commands strong brand recognition in the CRM space (including its stock ticker). This brand strength is leveraged with its newest products, which subsequently bring in customers to subscribe to the entire Salesforce ecosystem, rather than the more expensive and cumbersome option of piecemealing different software platforms for CRM.\n\nR&D : Salesforce\u2019s continued R&D with AI, Blockchain, and Quantum Computing Technology should help it maintain its \u201cleader of the pack\u201d position in the CRM space.\n\nInternational Marketing and Sales : This demographic will be the next big growth target for Salesforce. This will help to offset its focus on primary market large players, which necessitate longer sales cycles and are subject to more competition from rivals.\n\nStock Price Prediction for 2025\n\nAndriy Onufriyenko / Moment via Getty Images\n\nA consensus taken from 44 different Wall Street analysts predicted Salesforce\u2019s price target in 12 months to be $307.64. This calculates as a gain of 12.24% from today\u2019s stock price of $274.09. The overall average recommendation was \u201coutperform\u201d.\n\nBased on our assessment of the financials, 24/7 Wall Street projects a somewhat more conservative target price of $302.00. The departure of the highly regarded CFO, Amy Weaver, is a negative. Her enviable track record managing restructuring efforts and the level of respect she commands on Wall Street cannot be disregarded. Although she will remain as an advisor once her successor has been selected, the comfort of a smooth transition is not guaranteed.\n\nSalesforce Inc.\u2019s Next 5 Years\u2019 Outlook\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nAs Salesforce\u2019s Fiscal Year 2026 ends on January 31, 2026, the events that drive its stock performance occur predominantly throughout 2025. 24/7 Wall Street projects a stock price of $333.90, a gain of 21.82% from today\u2019s stock price of $274.09.\n\nThe integration of blockchain technology into Salesforce\u2019s product offerings is expected to be a key driver sometime in 2025. With cybersecurity breaches multiplying by the month, the ability to repel CRM platform hackers is vitally important to enterprise customers. FY 2026 should also see the start of the rewards from its international initiatives, which will likely manifest writ large throughout 2026 for FY 2027.\n\nFY 2027 will likely begin to see the primary fruits from the international sales and marketing initiated during the latter part of FY 2024 and all of 2025. A target price of $380.70 would represent a 38.90% gain from today\u2019s stock price of $274.09.\n\nEuropean business accounted for roughly 23.5% and Asia Pacific 10.1%. It is predicted by several analysts to grow to 21.6% of total revenues by or before FY 2027. Salesforce\u2019s expansion into emerging markets is also likely to accelerate, particularly in Southeast Asia and Africa. This is untapped territory which can be a deep source of new revenue streams that can offset risks from established markets due to geopolitical and economic factors.\n\nAdditionally, Salesforce\u2019s investments in edge computing solutions should enhance its competitive advantage in the IoT space. Integration of Einstein AI for hybrid workers who spend half or more of their work time from home may likely become early converts to these additional digital tools.\n\nThe 2028 stock price target is anticipated to be $412.80.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s focus on customization towards vertical-specific CRM solutions is expected to bear fruit in 2027. By tailoring its offerings to industries such as healthcare, financial services, and manufacturing, the company expects to capture a larger market share and increase customer retention.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s continued development of low-code and no-code platforms will likely also contribute its part to attracting a broader customer base.\n\nFY 2029 is projecting the completion of its integration of advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities into Salesforce\u2019s products. This technology may significantly enhance customer service automation and data analysis, providing an additional competitive edge. Salesforce\u2019s R&D in quantum computing research, building on its investments in Q-CNTRL and CQC, should also begin to yield practical applications, thus potentially opening new avenues for growth and innovation.\n\nDigital twin technology with VR is another new vista for Salesforce currently in R&D, but may possibly be prepared to launch during 2028-29. By creating virtual replicas of physical systems, the company may offer unprecedented insights and optimization capabilities to its customers.\n\n$451.50 is 24/7 Wall Street\u2019s projected stock price for FY 2029, a 64.73% gain from today\u2019s stock price of $274.09.\n\nSalesforce Inc. Stock in 2030\n\nJasonDoiy / iStock Unreleased via Getty Images\n\nIn FY 2030, we predict Salesforce can hit a stock price of $493.80, an 80.16% increase from today\u2019s stock price of $274.09.\n\nBy 2029-2030, Salesforce\u2019s R&D investments in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies may be ready for prime-time commercialization.\n\nThese immersive technologies could revolutionize customer engagement and data visualization, potentially opening new revenue streams. As Salesforce expands its offerings, it may face increased competition from other enterprise software providers like ServiceNow.\n\nOne other aspect of Salesforce not yet mentioned, since when its impact may become manifest is unknown, is its venture capital work in tech startups. Salesforce Ventures has a $500 million Generative AI Fund that includes a $200 million investment in Hugging Face, the largest open-source AI community on Earth. Salesforce\u2019s presence in Hugging Face is strategically intended to expose Hugging Face using entrepreneurs to Salesforce\u2019s CRM products in a soft sell approach that can potentially reap billions as these startup companies take off.\n\nFiscal Year Normalized EPS P/E Ratio Projected Stock Price 2025 $10.06 30 $302.00 2026 $11.13 30 $333.90 2027 $12.69 30 $380.70 2028 $13.73 30 $412.80 2029 $15.05 30 $451.50 2030 $16.46 30 $493.80"

However, electrifying processes that require higher temperatures, such as glass-making or smelting metals like iron and aluminum, has been a much tougher task.\n\nCalectra's solution to the problem is to electrify and superheat special bricks by directly electrifying them, generating both light and heat. The hot air generated around the superheated bricks would then be fed into industrial processes, allowing them to heat what needs heating.\n\nGetting the air to the temperature required for those tasks is incredibly energy-intensive, and even the level of electricity required would be cost-prohibitive for many manufacturers without the use of dirty fuels like natural gas or coal, Canary Media reported.\n\n\"Industrial heat accounts for one-quarter of the global energy consumption and is a massive, $450 billion market,\" Juha Lindfors, a partner at Lifeline Ventures, said in a statement on its funding of Calectra, \u200b\"Decarbonizing industrial heat presents a huge opportunity.\"\n\nCalectra's technology is still in the very early stages of development; the company hopes to expand its team to begin testing ideal materials for its processes and scale up its testing to make sure the process works at a level needed for industrial production.\n\nBut if they're successful, the use of electrified bricks could go a long way toward eliminating one of the largest planet-warming gas producers.\n\nWill America someday get all its energy from renewable sources?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\n\"We're laser-focused on building a solution for high-temperature heat at low cost and zero carbon,\" Calectra's co-founder Pauliina Meskanen said, per Canary Media. \"It's risky, but it's worth giving it a shot for the sake of the climate.\"\n\nSuperheated materials are also under investigation as a way to store energy.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

        "article_content": "Southwest Airlines has revealed when assigned seating will start and how it will implement other changes to its flying experience in an effort to improve profitability.\n\nThe announcement, unveiled ahead of Southwest's Investor Day on Thursday, Sept. 26, revealed details of the airline's transformation plan \u2212 billed as \"Southwest. Even Better.\" \u2212 that will be phased in over the next three years.\n\nIt included when and how Southwest will get rid of open seating, how assigned and premium seating will work, and the future of its Bags Fly Free policy allowing flyers two free checked bags.\n\nSouthwest first disclosed in July that it would start assigned seating but was scant on additional details. That month, it also said it would begin flying red-eye flights in 2025; Phoenix will get some of those red-eyes, including two just-announced routes connecting Hawaii and Phoenix.\n\nWhen is Southwest changing to assigned seating?\n\nSouthwest Airlines will end open seating in early 2026.\n\nIt will sell tickets for the first flights with assigned and premium seating in the second half of 2025.\n\nHow will Southwest Airlines assigned seating work?\n\nAssigned seating on Southwest will work similarly to other airlines: Passengers who buy the cheapest tickets can select a seat for a fee, or a seat will be assigned to them the day before their flight.\n\nPassengers can also purchase premium seats with extra legroom. Premium seats will offer up to 5 additional inches of seat pitch, or the distance between seats. About a third of Southwest's seats will be premium, and premium passengers will be among the first to board the plane.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards members can select seats without paying additional fees depending on their rewards status. A-List members can select standard legroom seats at the time of booking at no additional cost; they'll have the opportunity to upgrade to a premium seat within 48 hours of the flight at no extra cost if any are still available. A-List Preferred members can select any available seat, including extra legroom seats, at no additional cost.\n\nSouthwest did not indicate whether legroom on standard seats would change from the current average seat pitch of 32 inches.\n\nWhen is Southwest ending free checked luggage?\n\nSouthwest is not ending free checked luggage \u2212 at least for now. Every ticket will continue to include two free checked bags.\n\nWhile customers love the policy \u2212 American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines raised their baggage fees in early 2024 \u2212 investors think Southwest is leaving money on the table by not charging for checked luggage.\n\nElliott Investment Management, the activist investor pushing for sweeping changes at Southwest, hinted in a presentation called Stronger Southwest that charging fees for checked luggage would improve Southwest's profitability.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards changes and other news\n\nSouthwest Airlines Investor Day also included these announcements:\n\nNew global airline partnerships. Southwest announced a partnership with Icelandair to offer international flights out of Baltimore-Washington International Airport; more partnerships and participating airports will be announced.\n\nNew vacation packages. In 2024, Southwest will launch Getaways by Southwest, offering customizable vacation packages.\n\nChanges to Rapid Rewards program. Southwest will update benefits for its Rapid Rewards loyalty program, giving A-List and A-List Preferred frequent flyers the highest level of benefits. The airline intends to add opportunities for Rapid Rewards members to earn and redeem points for long-haul destinations as it develops international partnerships and Getaways by Southwest.\n\nAll Rapid Rewards members will continue to earn and redeem points at the same rate they do today and the program will continue offering no blackout dates, uncapped reward seat availability and points that don't expire.\n\nMichael Salerno is an award-winning journalist who\u2019s covered travel and tourism since 2014.
