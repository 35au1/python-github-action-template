Reader Jason Patrick asked why scientists chose that drug.\n\nIt can be hard to design studies of psychedelics because the drugs\u2019 effects are usually obvious to both researchers and participants, Sanders says. Though the control, called methylphenidate, and psilocybin produce very different experiences, the drugs have some similarities, Sanders says.

A 1978 paper in Applied Optics suggested that the mysterious light displays were probably caused by swarms of spruce budworm moths, not aliens. As the insects \u201cflew through electrified air in the sky, their legs and antennae glowed with St. Elmo\u2019s fire,\u201d Wolman wrote. The atmospheric phenomenon produces glowing plasma around objects in an electrically charged field."

        "article_content": "Google announced its newest entry into the Workspace suite of AI-powered apps, Google Vids, in June 2024. Google Vids isn't the text-to-video tool you might expect. After watching its introductory video, it's clear how Google views this new tool being used. The announcement came on behalf of the Google Slides Team.\n\nGoogle Vids looks more like AI-assisted Google Slides than it does a video editor. This might be exciting for some people who use Workspace for business or video production, but not so much for the average consumer. When we think of AI video, we typically think of generative AI, but could this be a handy tool for some?\n\nGoogle Vids has a simple and familiar UI\n\nGoogle's demo video advertises Google Vids as a corporate presentation editor for things like product pitch videos or employee training videos. What you edit is more of a souped-up PowerPoint presentation that can be downloaded as a video or shared with a link. The primary interface looks a lot like Google Slides. The editor features a basic video timeline and tools similar to Slides for adding text, images, and videos.\n\nGoogle Vids editing format\n\nAs Google Vids rolls out to Workspace users, there's a 10-minute time limit, and it only supports horizontal video content. The interface is intuitive, especially for those familiar with Google Slides. The scene-based editor allows you to edit visual and audio content in each scene, keeping you organized and able to easily re-order your scenes. The UI is heavily influenced by Slides and was developed with business users in mind.\n\nGoogle Vids AI-power is mostly Gemini-based\n\nEven though Google says Google Vids helps you create a video using AI, it doesn't help you create the actual video content. You can't create a video of people working in an office or using your product. The AI-powered aspects of Google Vids focus on the early stages of video production. You can use Help me create to make an editable storyboard outline, suggested scenes with suggested text, and a generated script for recording your voiceovers. All you do is enter a prompt, and Gemini does the rest.\n\nsample prompts for Google Vids\n\nGemini primarily powers the AI functionality, but other processes may occur behind the scenes. You can add related files before generating your outline to improve the output quality and give the AI a better idea of the project you're working on. You can use Gemini's text-to-image generator, Imagen 3, inside Google Vids. The integration is seamless if you need to create an image of an asset you don't have.\n\nAs people get more used to prompting, struggling to get the output you imagine is commonplace. If you have difficulty with your prompts, you can generate new suggested ones to get you started.\n\nGoogle Vids only has minimal capabilities\n\nAfter creating your video outline, you can collaborate on it in real time, like you can in Docs, Sheets, and Slides. You can add your own text, images, and music. You can also use royalty-free stock content from Google's library. You can customize the look and feel of your video by choosing a design template, or you can create your own.\n\nGoogle Vids design templates\n\nYour video storyboard outline contains several media placeholders, suggested places to add live voiceovers, and places to swap out the temporary stock video with your own. There's also a built-in function to record video of yourself, your voice, and your computer screen using its recording studio. You can download your video as an MP4 or share it with a link when you finish.\n\nGoogle Vids targets corporate users, making it look like it's competing with Loom and similar competitors. It's unlikely to appeal to many regular content creators, who can use basic tools like YouTube Studio to edit their videos, or more professional editing apps like Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve. The recording studio features can be done with any desktop operating system (even ChromeOS used on budget Chromebooks), so the unique selling points are the Google Slides-like editing and group collaboration.\n\nIs Google Vids destined for the Google graveyard?\n\nGoogle Workspace Labs, like its regular counterpart, Google Labs, is how Google releases experimental products and features before fully adopting them. It's been a testing ground for various features that have been integrated into its suites, but we've also seen several Google products discontinued over the years. Remember Google Reader, Google+, Google Hangouts, or Inbox by Gmail?\n\nWe don't know if Google Vids will make it into the public sphere, but right now, only businesses with a Workspace subscription who have activated Workspace Labs can create a video with Google Vids. If you use Google Workspace, you can sign up for Workspace Labs to see if Google Vids is something you're interested in. If you don't have Google Workspace, you can get a 14-day trial, and after that, you'll need to sign up for a one-year commitment with Google's standard Workspace pricing to keep using it.\n\nIs this the future of video presentations?\n\nCould this replace slide-style business presentations? Probably not. Slides has been around forever because the format makes sense. Presenters don't want to pause a video at the right moment and then have to scrub back if they missed their timing. Modern slide tools allow videos to be embedded, so there's no reason to switch. Google may have been better off reserving the Google Vids name for a product better suited to it.\n\nIf you don't have access to Google Vids, learn a few Gemini tricks to transform Google Slides presentations and get the job done in style."

        "category": "ai+app",
        "date": "10h",
        "source": "The Motley Fool",
        "article_content": "These two disruptive small-caps can deliver big returns for investors.\n\nBreakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) technology are transforming various industries. Innovations from mega-cap tech leaders like Nvidia have opened the door for emerging companies to capture their slice of a significant market opportunity.\n\nBigBear.ai (BBAI 1.34%) and SoundHound AI (SOUN) are two small-caps attempting to leverage unique AI-powered applications into long-term growth. Let's explore which stock could be a better buy for your portfolio.\n\nThe case for BigBear.ai\n\nBigBear.ai is developing a suite of proprietary machine learning and computer vision technology into a platform of AI-driven analytical tools.\n\nSolutions covering cybersecurity, supply chains & logistics, and autonomous systems have found success with government and commercial markets. The company's advanced facial recognition and image-based threat detection are in use at major airports around the world. BigBear.ai also counts on the U.S. Department of Defense as a customer for its ConductorOS platform.\n\nUltimately, the attraction of BigBear.ai as an investment is the potential that the company can consolidate its leadership in these specialized areas of AI.\n\nOn the other hand, the operating and financial results have been marred by weaker-than-expected momentum. In the second quarter (for the period ended June 30), BigBear.ai revenue of $40 million climbed by just 3.4% year over year, impacted by the timing of certain large contracts.\n\nThe other challenge is that profitability remains elusive. The company reported a loss on Q2 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $3.7 million, expanding from a loss of $3.2 million in the year-ago period. BigBear.ai also has more than $134 million in net debt without a clear path for generating free cash flow anytime soon.\n\nThose headline numbers aren't great, but there are still enough positives in the outlook for investors to stay upbeat on the stock. Favorably, Q2 revenue was up 20% sequentially from the first quarter, while management is guiding for full-year revenue growth of around 11% from 2023 with an effort to improve margins going forward.\n\nWhat I like most about BigBear.ai is its pure-play exposure to AI in a cutting-edge corner of the technology. The stock is trading at just 2 times its 2024 revenue guidance as a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. This modest level, reflecting the risks associated with poor earnings trends, could prove to be a bargain if the company begins generating stronger and more profitable growth.\n\nThe case for SoundHound AI\n\nSoundHound AI has emerged as a leader in conversational artificial intelligence dealing with speech-enabled applications for people to interact with smart devices. The technology is integrated by automakers for in-vehicle voice commands and generative AI as a core part of its business.\n\nThe company has also expanded into the food service industry, including AI voice-enabled point-of-sale interfaces that fast-food restaurants are increasingly adopting. Earlier this year, SoundHound acquired Amelia, an enterprise AI software specialist, to accelerate the company's customer service solutions, such as virtual call center automation. Indeed, the company's strong point is its diverse portfolio of disruptive offerings.\n\nCompared to BigBear.Ai, the trends from SoundHound AI have been much more impressive. The company reported 54% revenue growth in the second quarter (for the period ended June 30) with management citing strong customer momentum across its key industries.\n\nThe company expects 2024 revenue growth of around 77%, with an initial forecast for 2025 of $150 million, implying an even stronger 88% growth rate next year.\n\nAt the same time, investors are faced with paying a lofty premium for shares while SoundHound AI remains unprofitable. The company reported negative $13 million in Q2 adjusted EBITDA with negative free cash flow expected to continue for the foreseeable future. In this case, the stock is trading at 20 times its full-year revenue forecast as a forward P/S ratio, which only modestly narrows to 11 based on the 2025 revenue estimate.\n\nIt appears the market is pricing in a growth runway through the next decade, which could be justified based on the opportunity, but also creates a high level of expectations. That tricky balance adds to the risks SoundHound AI investors must consider.\n\nThe better buy: SoundHound AI\n\nThere's a lot to like about BigBear.ai and SoundHound AI, which may both be in the early stages of transformational growth. Recognizing the speculative nature of these two small-caps with an expectation for volatility, I believe SoundHound AI is the better stock to buy today. Its lofty valuation is justified by the company's stronger growth prospects.\n\nA position in SoundHound AI stock within a diversified portfolio could work for investors with a long-term time horizon."

It has similar paraphernalia on top and Ghostbusters stickers on the side.\n\nHe bought the 2009 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor from someone in Glenrock a few years ago.\n\nA hospital security guard when not busting ghosts, McDaniels had his uniform on when he initially drove the unmodified car. Wyoming Highway Patrol pulled him over, thinking he might be trying to impersonate a police officer.\n\nGhostbuster Interceptor\n\n\u201cI thought I should probably make this car less cop like and more something fun. And I had always wanted to have a Ghostbusters car, so I started to put stickers on it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell then I thought, now I\u2019ve got to build a top in it, it can\u2019t just be stickers right? So, I started piecing together bit by bit the roof rack and housing and built all that out. There is one piece of pipe up that\u2019s up there being held onto the roof by a toilet flange.\u201d\n\nOnce he had his wheels, as well as the \u201cECTOI\u201d license plate, the doors opened for him to use it for fundraisers and to market his ghost removal side gig.\n\nOctober becomes the busy season. There is a \u201cTouch a Truck\u201d event on Oct. 12 at the Excel Academy Private School that allows kids to get in the vehicle, turn on the sirens, read the special tag fastened on the dash that labels the machine as belonging to Wyoming Ghostbusters, and check out the glove compartment.\n\n\u201cThere is a ghostbuster\u2019s employee handbook and a little canister of ectoplasm slime,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids like to play with all that stuff.\u201d\n\nHe also plans to be at a car show and food drive at the Izaak Walton Clubhouse in Casper on Oct. 18 and end the month on Oct. 25, 27 and 28 with actual ghostbusting demonstrations at the Casper Elks Lodge No. 1353 where he said the equipment used by paranormal investigators will be explained and a walk through of the lodge will be conducted.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m discussing a fundraiser for a lady that is trying to fight cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try and kind of use the car as a way to help people out.\u201d\n\nAs in the movie, McDaniels and some other members of the team have uniforms and he and a buddy have the proton packs used in the last version of the film series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the iconic part of Ghostbusters history, it gets people excited,\u201d he said.\n\nSupernatural Missions\n\nIn addition to the fundraising, and parties, McDaniels also has been on an estimated 15 missions to identify or remove potential paranormal spirits in places around the region and state.\n\nHe recently was called to a Casper home where the owners discovered a set of footprints on concrete that went from a pickup truck to the garage door and then just vanished.\n\n\u201cWhat it looked like was that somebody had walked through a puddle of grease, made about four or five steps to the garage door and then nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of crazy.\u201d\n\nMcDaniels pulled out his EMF meter that measures electro-magnetic energy and found it registered a few points over the footprints and faded when pulled away from them. He checked to see if there were any internet routers or other source of energy nearby that would trigger the meters. There were none.\n\nOther tools in his ghostbusting toolbox include REM-Pod devices that reflect electromagnetic field changes and air temperature changes and a specialized SLS (Structured Light Sensor) camera that uses infrared light. It can 3D map areas in front of it \u201cso we can see things the human eye might miss,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also uses other cameras that can capture images in ultraviolet, infrared, and the normal spectrum of light.\n\nAt the garage, McDaniels set up some REM Pods around the area to see if anything would trigger them. Nothing happened. Photos with the infrared camera found nothing.\n\nBut it\u2019s not always that way. McDaniels tells the story of being called to a Casper home about five blocks from the cemetery with a man experiencing doors being slammed in his home for no reason.\n\n\u201cHe said he was sitting on the couch one day and he felt like his leg started to burn,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cHe looked down and it looked like a handprint had been slapped on his thigh. So, we got to go down and work with that.\u201d\n\nThe man requested that McDaniels and his team bless the house. McDaniels said he has studied different spiritual beliefs including druidism and another team member is a Norse shaman.\n\nPeter McDaniels' version of Ecto-1 is a former police interceptor that he has adapted for his Ghostbuster gigs.

(Courtesy Peter McDaniels) Arrow left Arrow right\n\nStubborn Spirit\n\nTheir attempts to get rid of the spirit by blessing the house did not work. He claims it was forced into a back room. McDaniels had read about a dybbuk box used in Jewish tradition that is supposed to be able to contain a spirit. So, he tried using one.\n\n\u201cWe kind of forced this thing into the dybbuk box and sealed it,\u201d he said. McDaniels said as he was talking to the man at the house, he placed the box by the front tire of his Ghostbuster car and the tire deflated. He had to pump it up to leave.\n\nThere was another hurdle as well. Weather at the time was cold and the ground hard, so he couldn\u2019t bury the box as would be his practice. So, he kept it in a storage area at his house. McDaniels noticed the wax seal that he put on the box kept cracking. He needed to keep sealing it nearly every day.\n\nThen his radio started to flip on in his house at random times and the song coming out of the speakers would have a lyric such as \u201cset me free\u201d or \u201clet me loose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like, no buddy, that\u2019s not how this works,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cAs soon as it was warm enough we went and buried the box and all of that stopped afterwards.\u201d\n\nHe said the man in the house never had issues again as well.\n\n\u2018Get Out\u2019\n\nThe 39-year-old talks about an incident several years ago when he went to a trailer in the \u201cmiddle of nowhere\u201d as he was receiving training from a woman he labels a \u201cChristian witch.\u201d\n\nThe trailer sat on a plot of land that was said to have had a Native American burial ground underneath it. He said he entered the trailer and it was dark and he was trying to feel his way around and made it to a bedroom and sat on the bed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just kind of sitting there trying to feel things out and I felt the bed depress behind me like someone was standing on it and then I hear the words \u2018get out\u2019 whispered in my ear,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, I calmly stood up, and I walked out the front door and I got into the car next to the lady that was helping us. And she said, \u2018Are you OK?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018nope,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt scared me, oh man, it scared me.\u201d\n\nDale Killingbeck can be reached at dale@cowboystatedaily.com."

        "article_content": "PARKERSBURG \u2014 The new West Virginia Paranormal Trail includes several local attractions.\n\nSites on the trail are the Blennerhassett Hotel and Spa in Parkersburg and the Flinderation Tunnel on the North Bend Rail Trail.\n\nThe Paranormal Trail is designed \u201cto help spook-seekers discover the state\u2019s most spine-chilling sites,\u201d the Department of Tourism with Gov. Jim Justice said in a release. An accompanying digital passport allows visitors to check in at haunted locations, earning points for prizes along the way.\n\nThe launch of the West Virginia Paranormal Trail follows the recent announcement of Haunted Ohio: 24 Must-Visit Places by TourismOhio, the tourism arm of the Ohio Department of Development. The Lafayette Hotel and the Hackett Hotel in Marietta are on the trail. Nearby on the list are Hocking Hills State Park in Logan and The Ridges at Ohio University at Athens.\n\n\u201cThe haunted and paranormal stuff is so popular,\u201d said Mark Lewis, president and CEO of the Greater Parkersburg Area Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\nLewis cited the popularity of the annual Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant, where the Silver Bridge collapsed in 1967, killing 46 people. According to folklore, the cryptid Mothman is tied to the collapse.\n\nThe Mothman Museum in Point Pleasant also is on the Paranormal Trail.\n\nIt\u2019s late in the tourist season, but not too late to promote the Paranormal Trail and the local attractions, Lewis said. A goal of the trail and its promotion, among others, is to increase room stays, he said.\n\n\u201cWe think we can bring in people for the haunted tours and the Paranormal Trail,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Blennerhassett Hotel is ranked in the Top 10 most-haunted hotels in North America, Adra Johnson, who runs the ghost tours and investigations at the hotel, said. She also is involved with the separate Susan Sheppard\u2019s Haunted Parkersburg ghost tour.\n\nAttractions applied to be on the Paranormal Trail, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very grateful to be on it,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nApparitions at the hotel include the specters of children playing tag in the halls, unexplained knocks on the door and hotel builder William Chancellor smoking a cigar, believers believe.\n\nThe Paranormal Trail has already generated interest, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten several phone calls already,\u201d she said.\n\nActivities are held year round at the hotel and are popular, Johnson said. Appalachian ParaCon, a paranormal convention, will be held Oct. 18, 2025, at the hotel, Johnson said.\n\nLewis will propose two more local attractions to be added to the trail, the Riverview Cemetery in the 1300 block of Juliana Street in Parkersburg and the Silver Tunnel on the North Bend Rail Trail, a 1,376-foot tunnel near Cairo.\n\n\u201cI think the Silver Tunnel is more well known for paranormal activity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe weeping woman statue overlooking the graves of the Jackson family is located at Riverview Cemetery where many notable citizens in Parkersburg\u2019s history are buried.\n\n\u201cRecent trends have shown us that travelers are increasingly interested in spooky and unique destinations,\u201d West Virginia Department of Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby said. \u201cWest Virginia has quite a few spots with haunted histories, so we created the Paranormal Trail to tap into the thriving market for themed tours and attractions. Whether learning about local legends or touring notoriously haunted attractions, it appeals to travelers interested in spooky sightings, mystery and local lore.\u201d\n\nOther landmarks on the Paranormal Trail are the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, Lake Shawnee Abandoned Amusement Park, Harpers Ferry, the Hotel Morgan in Morgantown, the Flatwoods Monster Museum in Flatwoods, Old Hospital on College Hill in Williamson, the Historic Glen Ferris Inn in Glen Ferris, the Shepherdstown Mystery Walk, the Haunted Haymond, the Elk River Trail between Ivydale and Duck and the West Virginia Penitentiary in Moundsville.\n\nInformation about the trail and how to earn points by visiting the site is at wvtourism.com/paranormal.\n\nTravelers can register online to participate in Paranormal Trail and receive the digital passport by email or text. Visitors check in to spooky spots around the state to earn points for an official Paranormal Trail sticker, a beanie and a limited-edition print by artist Liz Pavlovic of West Virginia.\n\nJess Mancini can be reached at jmancini@newsandsentinel.com."

        "article_content": "Ouija boards, spirited power figures and paranormal artefacts are not things you expect to see in a chapel, but this will soon be the case for one former place of worship that is going to be turned into a paranormal museum. Laura Rowton and her husband purchased the Penuel Chapel in Carmarthen from its previous owners Penuel Church last month, and plan to turn it into Rowton\u2019s Museum of the Paranormal and Spirituality.\n\nLaura said: \u201cWe are focusing on all different beliefs across time, including perhaps the less expected beliefs of the paranormal, popular spirituality, and looking at the history of that to provide an immersive experience to guests who are curious about the paranormal and different viewpoints about the nature of reality.\u201d\n\nThe couple chose the site specifically due to its history. Laura said: \u201cThis building actually has a paranormal history of its own. At the end of the 19th century, it is said to have been the site of miracles, particularly faith healing and supernatural manifestation. So it's a very special building in terms of the history of the paranormal and supernatural phenomena.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: I worked at Wales' most haunted house and it changed my view on life\n\nREAD MORE: The 12 most haunted places in Cardiff to visit this Halloween\n\nShe adds that the museum\u2019s aim is to \u201cgive people a chance to explore the different beliefs that people have had about the nature of reality in a safe space where there's no dogma.\u201d\n\nLaura says that the building is particularly suited for the museum and the couple has been busy decorating and moving their artefacts in. However they are particularly proud of their seance room in the old school room part of the building. She said: \u201cWe'll be holding seance evenings there, historical reenactments of a Victorian seance which was very popular in the 19th century and attended by many, many people within this country and around the world. This was a very popular spiritual practice. So we want to present that history to guests and give people a chance to immerse themselves in that.\u201d\n\nThe museum will have a range of exhibits in the chapel portions like exhibits on angels and saint relics. It will also have a \u2018laboratory\u2019 set up to look at parapsychological research.\n\nLaura said: \u201cWe're going to have some gadgets and tech in there, very exciting artefacts and also ones that guests will be able to interact with as well to see what these pioneers of the paranormal were doing in their research and also to have the chance themselves to see if they can have any experiences or responses that challenge their worldview.\u201d\n\nHowever not everyone is happy with the development, as the chapel\u2019s previous owners said they were unaware of the couple\u2019s plan to turn the chapel into a paranormal museum. In a statement shared on Facebook and their website, Penuel Church said: \u201cIn August 2024, we completed the sale of the building known as Penuel Chapel. We had been informed that the building would be used as a historical museum. However, in recent weeks, our church has sadly become aware of some other intentions of the current owners. We were unaware of these intentions at the point of sale.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cWe, as Penuel church, firmly believe in the truth of God\u2019s Word, the Bible. We therefore wish to state that the future intentions for the chapel site, as we understand them, are not in keeping with our church\u2019s ethos, values and beliefs. We would like to make clear that, as a church, we are in no way associated with this 'museum'.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Britain's 'most haunted village' where at least 12 terrifying ghosts are said to lurk\n\nREAD MORE:Welsh mansion to transform into haunted house this Halloween\n\nLaura insists that she and her husband had made their intentions to use the chapel clear at all different points of the sale. She said: \u201cFirstly, this is a historical museum and secondly, that statement is disingenuous by the previous owners. When my husband and I viewed the property back in December, we made our intentions clear that we would be turning it into a museum of spirituality. We told this to the estate agent and also it was brought up again on two separate occasions where we spoke over the phone and indeed in person with the previous owners. So we were always forthcoming about our intentions.\n\n\"Also, I'm a public person operating under the name Rowton's Museum. It's very easy to find out about the sort of work that my husband and I do. So I'm quite disappointed that they didn't come and talk to us first before making that statement. I think a lot of their concerns could have been alleviated. We're always happy to have a discussion with anybody. We've got nothing to hide and we think that we work for the same person anyway.\u201d\n\nIn reply to Wales Online\u2019s query, the Penuel Church said: \u201cThe intention with our statement was simply to explain that our church is not associated with the chapel and their future intentions, as they do not align with our church\u2019s ethos, values and beliefs as they do not align with our church\u2019s ethos, values and beliefs....\n\n\u201cThere is no more to say about this matter as far as we are concerned. We are glad to say that our focus is on looking to the future, and looking for a more suitable building for the current needs of our church, and continuing to do our best to reach out to our community with the great news about Jesus Christ.\u201d"

Web scraping is a fundamental task for gathering leads and analyzing competitors, providing valuable insights into market trends and strategies. Vision-based scraping takes things a step further, allowing you to examine visual content and gain a deeper understanding of branding and design elements. Additionally, social media scraping extends your reach to platforms like LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube, offering a comprehensive view of online interactions, trends, and consumer sentiment.\n\nUse web scraping for lead generation and competitor analysis\n\nUse vision-based scraping to gain insights into branding and visual content\n\nExtend your reach with social media scraping on platforms like LinkedIn, X, and YouTube\n\nBuilding an AI Agent (No-Code)\n\nHere are a selection of other articles from our extensive library of content you may find of interest on the subject of AI coding :\n\nDiverse Use Cases\n\nThe applications of no-code AI agents are virtually limitless. In the realm of competitor analysis, agents can collect data on market trends, pricing strategies, and product offerings, providing valuable insights to help you stay ahead of the curve. Lead generation becomes more targeted and efficient as agents identify potential prospects based on specific criteria, saving time and resources. Content idea generation is another area where AI agents excel, analyzing social media trends, influencer activities, and user engagement to help you create relevant and compelling content that resonates with your target audience.\n\nEssential Tools and Platforms\n\nTo build and optimize your AI agents, several tools and platforms are essential.

By assigning manager and sub-agent roles, you can delegate tasks efficiently and maintain a clear hierarchy within your team. Using flow builders and structured prompts helps guide your agents, ensuring accurate task execution and minimizing errors. Integrating Google Docs allows for easy report generation, providing organized and accessible data insights that can be shared across your organization.\n\nAssign manager and sub-agent roles for efficient task delegation\n\nUse flow builders and structured prompts to guide agents and ensure accuracy\n\nIntegrate Google Docs for easy report generation and data sharing\n\nAddressing Challenges\n\nWhile data scraping offers numerous benefits, it also presents certain challenges that must be addressed. Direct scraping from some platforms may have limitations or be subject to restrictions. To overcome these obstacles, it\u2019s essential to use third-party tools specifically designed for complex scraping tasks. Additionally, ensuring reliable agent performance requires the use of structured prompts and effective workflow management. By following these best practices, you can minimize errors, enhance data accuracy, and maintain a smooth and efficient scraping process.\n\nEthical Considerations and Insights\n\nThe data gathered by your AI agents can be a powerful tool for personalized outreach, allowing you to tailor your communications to specific audiences and improve engagement. However, it\u2019s crucial to maintain high ethical and legal standards when conducting data scraping. Respecting privacy, adhering to data protection regulations, and using the information gathered responsibly are all essential considerations. By using AI agents in an ethical manner, businesses can gain a significant competitive advantage, using data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions, optimize operations, and drive sustainable growth.\n\nIn conclusion, building a no-code AI agent team for data scraping is a transformative strategy for modern businesses looking to stay ahead in the digital marketplace. By integrating the right tools, platforms, and best practices, companies can automate data collection, enhance decision-making, and unlock valuable insights that would otherwise remain hidden. As the world continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, embracing the power of no-code AI agents is no longer a luxury, but a necessity for businesses seeking to thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape.\n\nMedia Credit: Ben AI\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

With an endless stream of messages flooding in, it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed and struggle to prioritize important communications. Fortunately, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and workflow automation have made it possible to create a powerful AI agent that can automate your email management without requiring any coding skills. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up an AI agent that can categorize and label incoming emails based on predefined criteria, ultimately enhancing your productivity and ensuring that you can focus on the most critical messages.\n\nGetting Started with Workflow Automation\n\nThe first step in creating your AI email management agent is to select a workflow automation tool that seamlessly integrates with your Gmail account. There are several popular options available, such as Zapier, IFTTT, or Automate.io, each offering a user-friendly interface and a wide range of integrations. Once you\u2019ve chosen your preferred tool, you\u2019ll need to set up an email trigger that will activate whenever a new email arrives in your inbox. To establish a secure connection between your Gmail account and the automation tool, you\u2019ll need to use your Google Cloud credentials. This crucial step ensures a smooth and secure flow of data, allowing your AI agent to process incoming emails effectively.\n\nChoose a workflow automation tool that integrates with Gmail\n\nthat integrates with Gmail Set up an email trigger to activate when new emails arrive\n\nto activate when new emails arrive Use Google Cloud credentials for secure integration\n\nConfiguring the Gmail API\n\nWith your workflow automation tool in place, the next step is to set up the Gmail API, which will allow your AI agent to access and manage your emails securely. This process involves creating an OAuth consent screen, which will enable users to grant permission for your AI agent to interact with their Gmail accounts. You\u2019ll need to generate an OAuth client ID and secret, which will be used to authenticate your AI agent and ensure secure communication between the agent and Gmail. This setup is essential for maintaining the privacy and security of your email data while allowing your AI agent to perform its email management tasks effectively.\n\nSet up the Gmail API for secure email access and management\n\nfor secure email access and management Create an OAuth consent screen for user authentication\n\nfor user authentication Generate an OAuth client ID and secret for secure communication\n\nNo Code Inbox Management AI\n\nHere are a selection of other articles from our extensive library of content you may find of interest on the subject of AI coding :\n\nClassifying Emails with AI\n\nWith the API configuration complete, you can now proceed to the heart of your AI agent: classifying incoming emails. In your workflow automation tool, you\u2019ll need to use a text classifier node that uses the innovative GPT-4 model. This advanced AI model excels at analyzing the content of your emails and accurately assigning them to predefined categories such as High Priority, Customer Support, Promotion, or Finance/Billing. By using the power of GPT-4, your AI agent can quickly and accurately sort through your inbox, saving you valuable time and allowing you to focus on the most important communications.\n\nUse a text classifier node in your workflow automation tool\n\nin your workflow automation tool Use the GPT-4 model for advanced email content analysis\n\nfor advanced email content analysis Sort emails into predefined categories like High Priority, Customer Support, Promotion, and Finance/Billing\n\nAssigning Labels for Organization\n\nOnce your AI agent has classified your incoming emails, the next step is to assign corresponding labels to each category. In your Gmail account, create a set of labels that match the categories you defined earlier, such as \u201cHigh Priority,\u201d \u201cCustomer Support,\u201d \u201cPromotion,\u201d and \u201cFinance/Billing.\u201d Then, in your workflow automation tool, configure nodes that will apply these labels to the emails based on their assigned categories. This labeling system will keep your inbox organized and allow you to quickly identify and respond to urgent messages, streamlining your email management process.\n\nCreate Gmail labels that match your predefined email categories\n\nthat match your predefined email categories Configure workflow nodes to apply labels based on email classification\n\nto apply labels based on email classification Keep your inbox organized for quick identification and response to urgent messages\n\nTesting and Launching Your AI Agent\n\nBefore deploying your AI email management agent, it\u2019s crucial to thoroughly test the workflow using a set of sample emails. This testing phase will help you ensure that the classification and labeling processes are working as expected and that your AI agent is accurately sorting and organizing your emails. Once you\u2019re satisfied with the results, you can activate the workflow, allowing your AI agent to operate continuously in real-time. With your agent up and running, you\u2019ll experience a significant improvement in your email management efficiency, as the AI takes care of sorting and prioritizing your messages.\n\nTest the workflow using sample emails to ensure accurate classification and labeling\n\nusing sample emails to ensure accurate classification and labeling Activate the workflow for continuous, real-time email management\n\nfor continuous, real-time email management Experience improved email management efficiency with your AI agent\n\nEnhancing Your AI Agent\u2019s Capabilities\n\nTo further optimize your email management process, consider enhancing your AI agent\u2019s capabilities by automating responses for specific email categories. For example, you can set up automated replies for common customer support inquiries, saving time and ensuring prompt communication with your clients. Additionally, you can configure your AI agent to notify relevant team members based on the classification of incoming emails, streamlining internal communication and collaboration. By implementing these enhancements, you\u2019ll create a more comprehensive and efficient email management system that adapts to your organization\u2019s specific needs.\n\nSet up automated replies for common customer support inquiries\n\nfor common customer support inquiries Configure notifications for relevant team members based on email classification\n\nfor relevant team members based on email classification Create a comprehensive and efficient email management system tailored to your organization\u2019s needs\n\nBy following the steps outlined in this guide, you can harness the power of AI to automate your email management tasks, even without any coding experience.
