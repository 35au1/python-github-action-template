And exactly that colour.\n\n\"Appeared and disappeared like alternating.\"\n\n\"Alien invasion before January 20,\" another said, noting the date of Donald Trump's inauguration into the White House.\n\nOne just simply posted an alien emoji.\n\nBut, others, including UFO experts, have started doubting this theory.\n\nAvi Loeb, a theoretical physician, cosmologist and Harvard professor believes the so-called flying orb is part of the camera.\n\nMoment UFOs appear in sky above Spain next to rainbow - before floods hit\n\nHe told the New York Post: \"This is most likely an optical artefact from the helicopter glass in front of the camera.\n\n\"Namely a bright spot from the reflection of sunlight as the camera gradually changes its orientation relative to the sun and the ground.\n\n\"But even if it was a real object, the apparent speed is of an order the speed of sound and not extraordinary.\"\n\nThis is a theory many other viewers of the video came up with.\n\nFAMOUS UFO INCIDENTS The \u2018Night of the UFOs\u2019 is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years. Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' \u2013 which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object \"shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet\". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana\u2019s Malmstrom Air Force Base. US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two \"ball of light\" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.\n\n\"A helicopter with blue water, blue sky and glass buildings reflecting off of it,\" one wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"Lens flare zooming past NYC accidentally caught on film by local news chopper,\" another said on X.\n\nOthers claimed it could have been a drone or a balloon.\n\n\"Maybe somebody\u2019s private drone was made to look like something else,\" one viewer suggested.\n\n\"That makes the most sense if it\u2019s not a balloon.\"\n\nA representative from the local news channel that filmed the clip told the Post that they do not know when the footage was recorded but confirmed it had not been edited.\n\nAnother source from the news outlet claimed that it was a drone that appeared to be moving at high speeds due to that of the chopper.\n\nEarlier this month, Congress heard a Pentagon whistleblower's bombshell testimony at a major hearing about UFO cases."

The epic track, which is taken from Schenker's recent My Years With UFO collection, features a rare new studio vocal from Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose.\n\nDuring sessions for the album recorded in Frankfurt in 2023, Rose agreed to try out three UFO songs to see how they worked out. He picked Too Hot To Handle and Love To Love from the Lights Out album, and Only You Can Rock Me from the following year\u2019s Obsession.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cAxl is a perfectionist,\u201d Schenker told Classic Rock earlier this year. \u201cHe puts everything under the microscope.

We are presumming that you have already installed Node.js and npm on your computer and have created a folder for React applications, however, the last part is optional for this step. CopilotKit uses an open source LLM model, in this tutorial we will be using OpenAI API key. Without further ado, let\u2019s get started.\n\nOpen Windows Terminal and go to the location where you have created the React app using cd (change directory) command.\n\ncd C:\\React\\myapplication\n\nNow, run the following command.\n\nnpm install @copilotkit/react-core @copilotkit/react-ui @copilotkit/runtime\n\nThen, execute the command mentioned below to install OpenAI.\n\nnpm install openai\n\nIn your project, go to the .eve file, it will be located in the root, and add the following line.\n\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n\nAfter making changes to the file, we recommend you navigate to docs.copilot.ai/quickstart to know how to configure the End Point and configure CopilotKit provider in your project.\n\n2] Configure Remote Backend Endpoint\n\nIn order to integrate Python-based services (or any other Node.js alternative), we have to connect Copilot app to a Remote Backend endpoint. To do that, let us first install Copilot dependencies in Windows Terminal using the following query.\n\npip install copilotkit fastapi uvicorn --extra-index-url https://copilotkit.gateway.scarf.sh/simple/\n\nNow, we need to setup FastAI server, to do that, run the commands mentioned below.\n\nmkdir my_copilotkit_remote_endpoint\n\ncd my_copilotkit_remote_endpoint\n\necho. > server.py\n\nIf the echo didn\u2019t work, you can open the folder in Visual Studio Code, and then create server.py file.\n\nOpen the server.py file in VSCode and then paste the following lines of code.\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n\nNow, go back to Windows Terminal and install FastAPI and Uvicorn.\n\npip install fastapi uvicorn\n\nOnce you are done with that, go to docs.copilot.ai guides to learn more.\n\n3] Add LangGraph agent\n\nNext up, we need to integrate LangGraph agent to the server.py file. First, locate the CopilotKitSDK instance within your Python Remote Endpoint, usually found in server.py. Next, adjust the CopilotKitSDK instance (established in the preceding step) to accommodate LangGraph agents. You need to add the following lines of code.\n\nagents=[ LangGraphAgent( name=\"basic_agent\", description=\"Agent that answers questions about the weather\", graph=the_langraph_graph, # copilotkit_config={ # if you use Google Gemini, uncomment this code (and import `copilotkit_messages_to_langchain`, see above) # \"convert_messages\": copilotkit_messages_to_langchain(use_function_call=True) # } ) ],\n\nThis should be enclosed under CopilotKitSDK tag.\n\nTo know more, we recommend you follow the guide mentioned in docs.copilotkit.ai/coagents.\n\nRead: What are best free AI Extensions for Visual Studio Code?\n\nHow do I build my own Copilot?\n\nTo create a new copilot, go to the Copilot Studio home page (at /copilotstudio.microsoft.com) and select Create in the left navigation, then choose the Copilots page. Alternatively, you can select + New copilot on the Copilots page. Use the chat to describe your copilot, guided by the provided questions, or select Skip to configure and fill out the form. Finally, select \u201cCreate\u201d to complete the process.\n\nRead: Best AI tools for Developers\n\nCan Copilot generate code?\n\nYes, Copilot can generate code. However, it can not be perfect; there can be multiple glitches and bugs. Therefore, one should not integrate the code provided by any AI chatbot without thorough manual inspections. You can use Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in Edge, the built-in app or use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio using extension.\n\nAlso Read: Use Copilot to Refractor Code."

        "article_content": "Alden Ehrenreich is known for playing a Young Han Solo but got his start playing a small role in the paranormal drama Supernatural.\n\nActor Alden Ehrenreich is best known for playing the role of Young Han Solo in the ill-fated 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story. He also had an important supporting role in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oscar-winning film Oppenheimer. However, before establishing himself as one of the most promising talents in Hollywood, Ehrenreich got his start in a rather small role.\n\nAlden Ehrenreich played Han Solo in Solo: A Star Wars Story (Credit: Lucasfilm).\n\nEhrenreich made his acting debut appearing in an episode of the hit paranormal drama series Supernatural, starring Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Moreover, given the show\u2019s fifteen-season run, the episode Ehrenreich featured in is easy to forget despite being an extremely underrated outing for the Winchester brothers, and here is everything you need to know in that regard.\n\nSolo Star Alden Ehrenreich Got His Start on Supernatural With Jensen Ackles\n\nAlden Ehrenreich\u2018s first acting credit was on the second episode of Supernatural. The actor was only fifteen years old when appeared in the role of Billy Collins in the episode Wendigo. In the episode, the Winchester brothers help siblings Haley and Ben find their missing older brother Tommy.\n\nAlden Ehrenreich made his debut on Supernatural (Credit: Warner Bros).\n\nThe episode marks the first instance in the series where Sam and Dean, played by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki encounter a monster instead of a spirit or a demon. It sees Ackles and Padalecki teaming up with Ehrenreich\u2019s character, leading to some intense and some outright goofy moments.\n\nThe episode\u2019s tonal inconsistencies can be chalked up to the fact that it was the show\u2019s second episode, with most of its lore and character dynamics yet to be set up. Nonetheless, the entire cast, including a young Ehrenreich delivered commendable performances, earning the episode a modest 7.8/10 rating on IMDB.\n\nEhrenreich was later cast in the role of Han Solo for the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story, taking over the iconic role from Harrison Ford. Despite the film\u2019s mixed reception, Ehrenreich\u2019s performance was largely praised. He is next slated to appear in the MCU series Ironheart.\n\nSupernatural Has a Long-Standing Connection to the Star Wars Franchise\n\nAside from Ehrenreich, actress Emily Swallow has also appeared in both Supernatural and the Star Wars universe. She played Amara in the former before appearing as The Armorer in The Mandalorian. However, the connection between the two brands does not end there.\n\nSupernatural has many Star Wars easter eggs (Credit: Warner Bros).\n\nOne of the biggest links between the two lies in the lead characters\u2019 names. According to creator Eric Kripke, the brothers\u2019 last name was originally supposed to be Harrison, as an ode to Harrison Ford. However, the name had to be changed because of legal reasons.\n\nRelated The Supernatural Episode Everyone Forgets Freddy Krueger Star Robert Englund Was in\n\nAn easter egg referencing the names was dropped in the show with Sam and Dean using fake U.S. Wildlife Service badges. In an episode, the duo used these fake badges with the names Agent Ford and Agent Hamill. Kripke later confirmed that Sam and Dean were loosely inspired by Luke & Han.\n\nSupernatural is streaming on Netflix."

        "article_content": "It\u2019s wild that anyone would want to go into The Zone by choice. But such is the addictive nature of the Stalker series. Even with all the harrowing attacks and life-draining challenges it throws at you, you can\u2019t help but return. I guess the trials and tribulations you go through are simply just that fun. For any newcomer to the series, worry not. You can always play the new Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl entry and feel right at home. But veterans, too, will have a blast, especially with how far the series has come over the past 16 years.\n\nIt\u2019s taken a heck of a long time to get our hands on a new title, justifiably because of the Russian-Ukraine war. But even despite the challenges Developer GSC Game World has faced, they\u2019ve still given us a fantastic way to kill afternoon spare time. Granted, there are glitches here and there that still need more time in the oven. The overall product, though, is a sight to behold and an even more thrilling venture to dive into. Find out all you can expect in our Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl review.\n\nCareful What You Believe\n\nThe Chernobyl nuclear disaster has definitely ignited lots of tales about the aftermath. In Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl, those tales double down on the paranormal. Invisible monsters are a thing, as are mutated humans. But the radiation, too, can quickly drain your health. Still, these are no match for the anomalies, energy phenomena that can pull you in and fry your brain matter. Or the storms, \u201cemissions\u201d that encroach throughout the Earth in dazzling red lightning streaks that turn the skies pitch red and the ground aflame. And, the emissions better not find you out in the wild, or you\u2019ll be ripped to shreds.\n\nAt every turn, The Zone wants to kill you. And, even if it\u2019s not the more horrifying creatures and paranormal events out to rip you apart, it\u2019s mob bandits looking to make a quick buck. Fortunately, the bandits are the easiest to deal with. At the start, your protagonist, Skif, ventures into The Zone, looking to recharge an artifact that spawned in his apartment, setting his home ablaze. But upon arrival, The Zone does you dirty, unleashing bandits on you who strip you of all your supplies and leave you for dead.\n\nPicking Up the Pieces\n\nSo, now, you\u2019re licking your wounds but determined to reclaim your stolen artifact. But you have very little to fight with, and so you must begin scavenging, making a quick buck to buy new gear and upgrades. This leads you to settlements where you can pick up side quests. Just your usual run-of-the-mill type of jobs, whether fetch quests, retrieval of valuable artifact missions, killing some guy, and such. But it\u2019s not the side quests themselves that really steal your heart, but rather the places they take you to. You discover a world brimming with a shocking balance of life and rot.\n\nMost places are desolate, with remnants of scorched bodies and intricately detailed rusty old machinery to bring them to life. Or the outside world, where danger lurks in the shadows, but also wondrous biomes to explore. Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl really takes the time to design an atmospheric brutal world. Whether using stunning weather that bears consequences on your life, pitch dark nights that demand flipping your flashlight and your heart pounding at the delving deeper into the unknown, or the constant eyeing of emissions whose mix of toxic red and green fumes will kill you near instantly. It\u2019s all so eerily designed, ensuring to sustain a realistic but doomed aura.\n\nLife Lives Here\n\nYou do run into all sorts of characters, free to choose whether to put a bullet in their head or help them on their diverse side missions. For the most part, the characters have believable voice acting. However, some of the English VO could use a little more authenticity. It can break the pace when you sometimes need to pay attention to the dialogue to keep track of any forthcoming threat. Meanwhile, the story itself is quite interesting. It balances exploration and combat-intensive missions quite well. Often, the need for the former comes in when your weapons and gear begin to fail you against the enemies you run into. Because as much as headshots are the surefire way to survive, enemies will inevitably grow stronger and more persistent.\n\nSo, you will often have to take a breather to do odd jobs, make an extra buck, and upgrade your gear. Then, you can proceed to chip away at more of the main quest. At its core, it pits various factions against one another. Each faction has its own agenda that you can choose to align yourself with. This is, of course, keeping in mind that the faction you support will likely ignite hostility from the others. And so, approaching either base of the rival factions will likely lead to ambushes, many of which can be utterly difficult to come out alive. The quickest reaction will often rule the day as you fire into encroaching enemies\u2019 heads. And when the difficulty spikes, it\u2019ll demand smart maneuvering around the environment to survive.\n\nShots Fired\n\nYou\u2019ll be dipping in and out of cover nearly constantly, and much of it will rely on reflexes that later on feel satisfying to have pulled off \u2013 even if you can\u2019t really explain how you made it out alive. I guess in that sense, Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl can be incredibly intense. You barely have the time to think through fights. So, you always have to make the most of downtime moments. Like when you\u2019ve just barely made it into an establishment to wait out an emission. And as you take in the stunning red skies and watch the lightning strikes fade out through the ground, you can plan your next move.\n\nBut you\u2019d much rather gather your supplies at a settlement before heading out into missions. Once in the thick of The Zone\u2019s harrowing threats, ammunition runs out quickly. Weapons break down. Skif needs to be fed, too, all of which demands effective preparation. Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl achieves a great balance with its gameplay elements. Despite how difficult it can get while in the heat of combat, you still never feel like it\u2019s unfair because there are numerous ways to retry and ensure you get it right. With the anomalies, you can use your trust scanner and bolts. If it\u2019s locating artifacts using the most efficient route, your echo detector comes in handy. Sound effects, too, are a great help, like crackling and popping sounds when approaching a high-radiation area.\n\nRough Edges\n\nThe only annoying thing is the mutated beasties that take away the satisfying feel of combat. They don\u2019t really reward your efforts with much. Meanwhile, there are some creatures that spawn in swarms. They sneak up on you from behind and nib away at your legs. And when you try to shoot them off, they are too fast to catch any bullet, making you waste precious ammo in the air. Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl can also be incredibly buggy, which I should add, the developers have been working at releasing patch fixes. However, the glitches can be quite interruptive when NPCs walk through walls and fall through the ground. When heads disappear, you\u2019re left emptying rounds into spongy bodies. When the AI is inconsistent, among other nitty-gritty, combined, it can detract from the overall experience.\n\nVerdict\n\nOver a decade later, we have the pleasure of jumping back into the harrowing but pleasant world of The Zone. It\u2019s an incredibly brutal exclusion area of the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, designed to kill you in all manner of ways. As a result, you\u2019re always on the edge of your seat, dreading the forthcoming bandits looking to make a quick buck, the mutated creatures thirsting for your blood, the deadly anomalies whose getting too close to can fry your brains, and, of course, the most lethal paranormal danger: the nuclear storm. If the storm finds you out and about, you\u2019re a goner.\n\nAnd so, even as the stunning, atmospheric world of The Zone steals away your heart and pulls you into exploring more and more of its thrills, the danger remains an ever-present sense of dread hanging at the back of your mind. For that, Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl is the perfect game to test your reflexes and perseverance. Even in the buggy moments, which the developer promises to iron out in due time, perseverance remains key to making the most of your time here. No matter your skill or newness to the Stalker series, if you can stomach the numerous threats to your life with limited resources if you can find ways to optimize a harsh world to your advantage, you\u2019ll find the shootouts well worth the blood pressure and the atmosphere wonderfully intoxicating."

The team also discovered four clay cylinders containing a form of alphabetic print.\n\nThe clay objects \u2014 about the length of a finger \u2014 were perforated, and Schwartz believes they were strung together during their use and operated as an ancient label.\n\n\u201cMaybe they detail the contents of a vessel, or maybe where the vessel came from, or who it belonged to,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout a means to translate the writing, we can only speculate.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian region is about 875 miles north of the great pyramids of Giza, where ancient Egyptians used hieroglyphics as written communication at least 500 years later.\n\n3 Researchers suspect the clay writing was used as a label. jhu\n\nJust south of Syria in modern-day Lebanon around the 11th century BC, the Phonecians \u2014 from whom the English word \u201cphonics\u201d derives \u2014 are credited with creating \u201cthe prototype for all alphabets in the world,\u201d according to UNESCO.\n\n\u201cAnd this new discovery shows that people were experimenting with new communication technologies much earlier and in a different location than we had imagined before now,\u201d said Schwartz."
