            "article_content": "Two relatively recent movies, UFO (2020) and Arrival (2018), have got me wondering \u2013 if we do encounter aliens, who would become the hero or protagonist?\n\nIn UFO, it was a mathematician who deciphered the alien telecommunication signal and uncovered government attempts to keep the public ignorant.\n\nIn Arrival, it was a linguist who managed to learn the alien\u2019s language and establish communication.\n\nThis got me thinking about the importance of both sciences (as represented by mathematics) and the arts (as represented by linguistics), although the latter is frequently given short shrift in our Malaysian education system.\n\nIn our current education system, the emphasis is on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Non-STEM disciplines like social sciences, humanities, languages and fine arts are often perceived as less important, prestigious or \u201cglamorous\u201d.\n\nThe nationwide matriculation college system was specifically established to promote STEM disciplines. The naming of our public universities, such as Universiti Sains Malaysia and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, pays tribute to the sciences.\n\nWhile our education system does make it compulsory for everyone to take Bahasa Melayu and History in secondary school, General Studies for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia, and several General Subjects in colleges or universities, many students take these subjects without much enthusiasm \u2013 just to pass them and \u201cget it over with\u201d.\n\nGlobally, North American, European and East Asian countries are currently powerhouses in science and technology.\n\nThe arts, however, are traditionally held in very high regard in China and Europe, and have arguably set the foundation for their subsequent progress and development.\n\nIn ancient China, steeped in Confucianism, government officials are required to excel in the \u201cSix Arts\u201d of etiquette, music, archery, chariot riding, calligraphy and literature, and mathematics.\n\nSimilarly, in medieval Europe, the aristocratic class was schooled in horsemanship, fencing, good manners, music, painting, mathematics, languages, literature and history.\n\nIn both settings, the emphasis was on a holistic education with art subjects given prominence. Thus, mastery of the arts was the mark of a learned Confucian scholar and an aristocratic European gentleman.\n\nBack to these two movies \u2013 they provoke our thoughts and make us reflect on our assumptions. This contrasts with most movies, which tend to numb our brains, requiring us to suspend logic and cast aside our intellect to enjoy them.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love Marvel and Star Wars movies for their great entertainment value \u2013 provided one does not overthink and assume that aliens generally speak English and are humanoid in appearance.\n\nThe storyline of Arrival is particularly captivating for me as it revolves around the real-life Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in anthropology, stunningly transformed from a dry textbook theory into a Hollywood movie.\n\nIn a nutshell, this hypothesis states that one\u2019s world view and reality are shaped by one\u2019s language. In other words, an English speaker will view and experience the world in a different light from a Malay, Chinese or Tamil speaker. For dramatic effect, the movie takes this hypothesis to the extreme when the protagonist learns the alien\u2019s language. But of course, we don\u2019t need an alien encounter to reflect on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Language is used to communicate and describe both the physical and social worlds, and it undoubtedly influences our thinking and perceptions.\n\nLearners of Chinese are drilled to always \u201cwrite inside the box\u201d and place great emphasis on conformity. Learners of English are drilled in past, present and perfect tenses, and they generally place a high value on timeliness. Speakers of multiple languages are thus able to access multiple perspectives and world views \u2013 a boon for a multiethnic society like Malaysia. The current phenomenon of artificial intelligence and machine learning has introduced an interesting new perspective: what world views, if any, do computer algorithms occupy, and are we able to access them?UFO and Arrival showcase the value of the film industry in engaging the public with academia.\n\nIn these movies, academic theories and mathematics are presented to a wide audience and applied in a realistic, albeit fictionalised, manner. In the process, these movies stimulate interest in learning and the pursuit of knowledge, both in the sciences and the arts.It is worth revisiting the earlier issue of the preference for the sciences in our Malaysian education system. Movies are a product of both the sciences and the arts.\n\nThe computer-generated imagery, sound engineering and cinematography are undoubtedly science-based. The storyline, music, acting and directing are undoubtedly arts-based.\n\nA good blend and balance of all these elements create a good movie.\n\nOur Malaysian education system should learn from the film industry. There should not be a lopsided focus on the sciences at the expense of the arts; rather, a good blend and balance of both should be what we strive for because only then can great education be produced.Dr Wong Teik Aun, a principal lecturer at the Centre of Australian Degree Programmes at INTI International College Penang, enjoys writing on subjects close to his heart and has published On the Beaten Track Nepal: The Himalayas, Symphony and Synchrony: An Orchestra of Ideas and Tales of Animal Lovers. He has also contributed numerous academic articles to internationally ranked journals. The views expressed here are the writer\u2019s own."

            "article_content": "Listen to article\n\nSomeone once asked Neil DeGrasse Tyson to explain his view about UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects). His response was a classic one. He said \"we must not forget what the U in UFO stands for.\" His argument was that we cannot spot something unusual in the sky and just believe that what we witnessed was a spaceship of aliens from another world. For decades, the UFO saga has been one of ridicule and shame, and one that belonged to the realm of conspiracy theories. The UFO was right up there with the moon landing being fake and the earth being flat.\n\nThat may have been a mistake according to Luis Elizondo who wrote a very compelling book about the continuous Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) sightings, which can't be ignored or pushed under the conspiracy theory rug. The book is called Imminent. For decades, the US army and naval aviators have been witnessing aerial vehicles in the sky, the speed and silence of which have convinced them that it was otherworldly technology. Perhaps we see them because they want to show themselves off to us. And we don't know about this because that is how the gatekeepers of information and the lords of secrecy want it to be.\n\nMany scholars and authors made the case in books and articles that 9/11 was a major intelligence failure. They also further argue that the invasion of Iraq was also an intelligence failure because they wrongfully assessed that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Let me pour some common sense on that total nonsense; these were no intelligence failures. They were totally by design. This is what the US intelligence community wanted. The CIA knew about two of the 9/11 bombers when they entered the US through Los Angeles in January 2000, a full 18 months before the execution of the big wedding attack. The CIA decided not to share the information with other US agencies. The only chemical weapons in Iraq were the ones provided by the US during the 80s for use against Iran. The US intelligence ignored all this and treated the information of Ahmed Chalabi as divine word over the issue of WMD. The choice to sit over information and not share it with other US agencies responsible for keeping America safe by consuming exactly this kind of intelligence resulted in lives being lost and money being wasted.\n\nToday, America is having a deja vu moment. The author Elizondo rightly quotes George Santayana who said, \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" There are certain US agencies including the CIA that know about the presence of aliens on our planet, keeping an eye on sensitive military installations, and God knows what else. I know it sounds totally bonkers but retired officers including the author of the book who have direct knowledge, not an idea or opinion, have testified in congressional hearings. The New York Times and others have published major pieces about it.\n\nInformation about these alien encounters are kept in secrecy for two major reasons. One, if naval aviators witness these alien vehicles in air, they are afraid to report them because there is a culture of being ridiculed by colleagues within the chain of command and can result in security clearance being taken away and promotion being denied. Two, that mindset of preventing information from spilling into other US government agencies is still very much intact. And that is the mistake that the author points to in the book as potentially inviting trouble again, only this time not from some bearded ragtag militia living in caves of Afghanistan but instead from an enemy whose presence we have yet to acknowledge and whose make up we have yet to understand.\n\nIf you see something unusual in the sky, don't be afraid to report it because at the end of the day, it is the citizen sighting of these UAP that might make the difference."

            "article_content": "For centuries, humans have used actuarial tables to figure out how long they're likely to live. Now artificial intelligence is taking up the task - and its answers may well be of interest to economists and money managers.\n\nThe recently released Death Clock, an AI-powered longevity app, has proved a hit with paying customers - downloaded some 125,000 times since its launch in July, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThe AI was trained on a dataset of more than 1,200 life expectancy studies with some 53 million participants. It uses information about diet, exercise, stress levels and sleep to predict a likely date of death. The results are a \"pretty significant\" improvement on the standard life-table expectations, says its developer, Brent Franson.\n\nDespite its somewhat morbid tone - it displays a \"fond farewell\" death-day card featuring the Grim Reaper - Death Clock is catching on among people trying to live more healthily. It ranks high in the Health and Fitness category of apps. But the technology potentially has a wider range of uses.\n\nLife expectancy is key to all kinds of financial and economic calculations, by governments, companies and individuals - from retirement income needs, to policy coverage at life insurance and pension funds, and financial planning.\n\nIn the US - which has lagged behind other developed economies in the life expectancy of its citizens in recent years - the Social Security Administration has its own table for mortality rates, which features in the annual financial report to trustees.\n\nThe government agency currently predicts that an 85-year-old man in the US has a 10% probability of dying within a year, and an average 5.6 years to live. But averages like that can be off by wide margins, says Franson, and the new algorithms can deliver a more tailored measure - a customized death clock.\n\nThat such findings are of interest in economics is demonstrated by the publication - in just the past month or so - of two papers around the topic by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\n'Harness The Benefits'\n\nOne of them, titled \"On the Limits of Chronological Age,\" looks at the diverse ways that the aging process affects physiological capacities. It finds that many aspects of economic behavior, like readiness to join the labor force, may not be well captured by people's calendar age - even though that's what policies such as statutory retirement are typically based on.\n\nBy continuing to rely on chronological age as a proxy for how well people can function, societies may end up failing to \"fully harness the benefits of increasing longevity,\" the researchers from Harvard and the London Business School conclude.\n\nAnother working paper examined the \"value per statistical life\" or VSL - a callous-sounding measure that's used for cost-benefit analysis in areas like regulation of pollution or compensation for workplace accidents. It's typically calculated based on compensation for workers in high-risk jobs.\n\nThe researchers behind the NBER study \"The value of Statistical Life for Seniors\" drew on a different dataset: the propensity of older Americans to spend money on medical services that reduce mortality risk. They found a mean VSL at age 67 of just under $2 million for people reporting their health as \"excellent,\" compared with $600,000 for those in \"good\" health.\n\nWhen it comes to personal finances, better measures of life expectancy will have profound implications for people saving for retirement, according to Ryan Zabrowski, a financial planner with investment advisory firm Krilogy.\n\n\"A huge concern for elderly people, our retirees, is outliving their money,\" says Zabrowski, who touches on the issue in his soon-to-be-released book, \"Time Ahead\".\n\n'Out The Window'\n\nDecisions such as how much to save and how fast to withdraw assets are often based on broad-brush and unreliable averages for life expectancy. AI-driven tests that can potentially reduce that uncertainty are largely unheard-of now, but likely won't be such an unusual idea in the future.\n\nWhat's more, the AI technology itself along with advances in medicine has the potential to boost life expectancy - and with it the risk of running out of savings. Zabrowski reckons one consequence is clear: longer retirements will mean savers need higher-return investments for their old age, which will push them to allocate more stocks over fixed-income securities.\n\n\"The conventional method of measuring demand for equities will be thrown out the window,\" he writes his forthcoming book. As people start expecting to live longer, there will be a \"massive escalation in demand for equities.\"\n\nThere are plenty of technologies already out there - like heart-rate monitors and maximal oxygen-consumption gauges from wearables - that have the potential, in tandem with new AI-powered devices, to reduce the uncertainty around personal mortality.\n\nOf course, there'll always be limits. On top of entirely unpredictable variables, like accidents or even pandemics, there are plenty of intangibles.\n\nLongevity Gap\n\nLoneliness, for instance, is often reckoned to reduce life expectancy. Gratitude may increase it. A Harvard study found that women who reported feeling the most grateful had a 9% lower risk of dying within three years than those who reported feeling the least.\n\nThen there's the question of inequality. For life expectancy, money matters. Multiple studies - including the work of Nobel prize-winning economist Angus Deaton on \"Deaths of Despair\" - have found a clear gap between rich and poor Americans.\n\nResearch published by the American Medical Association found the longevity gap between the wealthiest and poorest 1%, at age 40, was nearly 15 years for men and 10 for women.\n\nFor Death Clock users, who have to pay $40 a year to subscribe, the app suggests lifestyle changes that can hold mortality at bay - along with a second-by-second countdown of estimated time remaining.\n\n\"There's probably not a more important date in your life than the day that you're going to die,\" Franson says."

Pricing and availability subject to change.\n\nYou can re-enable original notepad.exe on Windows 11 by toggling its alias in Windows Settings.\n\nNotepad++ is a feature-rich text editor that is a solid AI-free Notepad alternative.\n\nNotepad is a simple text editor that has been included with Windows from the very beginning, providing simple, hassle-free plain text editing to literally generations of computer users. It's practically holy ground, but now it has an AI assistant. Here's how to fix that.\n\nRestoring Old School notepad.exe\n\nIf you're running Windows 11, at some point in the past, your version of Notepad was transparently replaced with a shiny new version from the Microsoft Store (the default app store available in Windows). When you run Notepad from the start menu or by running notepad.exe from the run dialog, this app store version is what is opened by default.\n\nThis version is the one that is being tainted with an AI assistant that can rewrite your text to make it shorter, longer, more formal, and most likely homogenized, and AI-like. As an extra kicker, it does this by sending the contents of your text file to Microsoft's servers, and they might even start charging you for it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThankfully, you can still re-enable the old version of Notepad by opening the Settings App (press Windows+i) and navigating to Apps > Advanced App Settings > App Execution Aliases and toggling off Notepad. Once you've done that, running notepad.exe from the Run dialog (accessed by pressing Windows+R, or right-clicking on the Start button) will open notepad.exe in its former glory.\n\nHow to bring back the old Notepad in Windows 11.\n\nYou can also create a shortcut to it by right-clicking on the desktop, selecting New > Shortcut, and entering notepad.exe into the location field.\n\nNotepad++: Arguably The Best Notepad Alternative\n\nIf you want to take this opportunity to find a notepad replacement that has a few extra bells and whistles (while still being lightweight), Notepad++ is an AI free plain text editor that has been a favorite with programmers for years, and retains that native \"Windows\" feel and responsiveness (probably because it's not a bloated Electron mess).\n\nIf you're looking to edit rich text (with formatting, font sizes, and images) or do some desktop publishing, there are Microsoft Word alternatives that offer a bunch of sophisticated features."

            "article_content": "Stanley Milford, Jr. has stories that most people wouldn\u2019t dare to believe.\n\nA seasoned Navajo Ranger, he spent 23 years exploring the depths of the paranormal on the Navajo Nation. From hauntings and Bigfoot sightings to UFOs and the mysterious appearances of coins falling out of thin air \u2014 all of it happened on his watch, and all of it left a mark.\n\nMilford, of Navajo and Cherokee descent, is a Fort Lewis College graduate who recently published his memoir.\n\nThe Paranormal Ranger is an account of Milford\u2019s time as a Navajo Ranger, during which he investigated supernatural occurrences around the reservation. The author juxtaposes his personal accounts with Navajo creation stories.\n\nThe book is a personal account of Milford\u2019s 23 years as a Navajo Ranger. The Rangers are part of the Navajo Nation\u2019s Division of Natural Resources, and they're tasked with protecting the lands and natural sites on the reservation.\n\n\u201cWe were assigned to investigate cases that were out of the ordinary,\u201d said Milford, \u201cinvolving what is commonly referred to as paranormal or supernatural haunting cases, Bigfoot cases, UFOs, extraterrestrial witchcraft, and Skinwalker-related cases.\u201d\n\nStanley Milford, Jr.'s book, The Paranormal Ranger, shares his experiences working with supernatural cases as a Navajo Ranger.\n\nSkinwalkers are evil spirits that can take animal form and often move on all fours. They\u2019re rarely discussed with outsiders unfamiliar with Navajo culture and beliefs. In The Paranormal Ranger, Milford shares some of these guarded stories, hoping to shed light on Navajo traditions and supernatural experiences.\n\nHe details an investigation he was a part of in Window Rock, Arizona.\n\n\u201cIn two days, there were 66 U.S. coins that would apport or just appear out of thin air and fall on the floor, or they would come flying across the room,\u201d said Milford. \u201cSometimes, they would hit us investigators. Out of all of those 66 coins, they all landed heads up.\n\nI witnessed with my own eyes at least 10 of these coins falling out of thin air, out of nothingness. That, for me, was a life-changing experience. It made me realize that the coins had to be coming from somewhere, some other space.\n\nFrom that time, this phenomenon followed me. I began having the coins appear in my home that would fall on the floor or fly across the room,\u201d said Milford.\n\nMilford juxtaposes his personal accounts of paranormal activities with Navajo creation stories in the book. These are the origin stories of the world and the Din\u00e9 people. He says he drew parallels between the Navajo emergence stories and what he experienced with these paranormal cases.\n\n\u201cThere's a different world that the Navajo people came [from]. They came into the physical world from four worlds or five lower worlds. When you look at the descriptions of the beings described in those tales, [they] fit with what I saw with the descriptions of the Bigfoot and extraterrestrial or alien beings,\u201d said Milford.\n\nMilford noted that he worked alongside 40 to 50 rangers as a Navajo Ranger. Today, there are less than ten.\n\nCopyright 2024 Four Corners Public Radio"

Next Article Next Article\n\nThe source of energy is a binary star system\n\nAstronomers discover record burst of energy coming from deep space\n\nBy Akash Pandey 07:14 pm Nov 30, 202407:14 pm\n\nWhat's the story A team of astronomers from the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) has detected a record-breaking energy burst from deep space. The source of this intense energy pulse, dubbed GLEAM-X J0704-37, is a binary system consisting of a small red dwarf star and a white dwarf, the remnant of a dead star. They made the discovery using archival low-frequency data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).\n\nUnique phenomenon\n\nGLEAM-X J0704-37: A unique long-period radio transient\n\nThe energy pulse, GLEAM-X J0704-37, is a one-of-a-kind long-period radio transient that erupts every three hours and lasts for 30-60 seconds. This makes it the longest-lasting case of such a phenomenon ever recorded. Since their first detection in 2006, these transients have baffled astronomers with their ability to generate radio waves. The latest discovery could shed light on the source of these energy bursts.\n\nResearch hurdles\n\nChallenges in studying long-period radio transients\n\nThe study of long-period radio transients has been difficult because they are located in densely populated regions of the Milky Way. This makes it hard to figure out what is producing these bursts of radio waves. Natasha Hurley-Walker, a member of the discovery team and researcher at Curtin University, said an optical image is required to understand these transients but there are often too many stars blocking the view.\n\nStar system\n\nGLEAM-X J0704-37's origin traced to specific star system\n\nThe discovery of GLEAM-X J0704-37 was a stroke of luck since it came from a less crowded region of the Milky Way, around 5,000 light-years away. \"Our new discovery lies far off the galactic plane, so there are only a handful of stars nearby, and we're now certain one-star system, in particular, is generating the radio waves,\" Hurley-Walker said. The team traced the origin of this peculiar long-period radio transient to one particular star system using South Africa's MeerKAT telescope.\n\nBinary system\n\nBinary system of red and white dwarf powers radio emission\n\nThe researchers found one of the stars in the GLEAM-X J0704-37 emitting system to be a low-mass red dwarf star or M-dwarf. However, an M-dwarf alone couldn't generate the observed energy levels. Additional analysis indicated that this red dwarf is part of a binary system with another object, possibly a white dwarf. \"Together, they power radio emission,\" Hurley-Walker said, explaining the source of these powerful energy bursts.\n\nTheory\n\nMagnetic fields and energy blasts: A new theory\n\nThe research team suggested that strong magnetic fields in this binary system could be causing the periodic energy blasts. These are similar to those seen from rapidly spinning neutron stars or pulsars. The unique location of the GLEAM-X J0704-37 emitting system helped researchers rule out a highly magnetic neutron star, or magnetar, as its source. The team is now working on confirming this binary system's nature and explaining how it launched GLEAM-X J0704-37."

            "article_content": "Footprints dating back 1.5 million years made by two different species of human ancestors have been found at the same spot\u2014a fossil first\u2014and the individuals likely passed within an hour from each other.\n\nMore than a million years ago, on a hot savannah teeming with wildlife near the shore of what would someday become Lake Turkana in Kenya, two completely different species of hominins may have passed each other as they scavenged for food.\n\nScientists know this because they have examined 1.5-million-year-old fossils unearthed here and have concluded they represent the first example of two sets of hominin footprints made about the same time on an ancient lake shore.\n\nThe discovery will provide more insight into human evolution and how species cooperated and competed with one another, said scientists who explained that \u201chominin\u201d is a newer term that describes a subdivision of the larger category known as hominids. Hominins includes all organisms, extinct and alive, considered to be within the human lineage that emerged after the split from the ancestors of the great apes, believed to have occurred about 6 million to 7 million years ago.\n\nThe study, published Thursday in the journal Science, offers hard proof that different hominin species lived contemporaneously in time and space, overlapping as they evaded predators and weathered the challenges of safely securing food in the ancient African landscape. Making the footprints were the two most common human species of the Pleistocene Epoch\u2014Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cTheir presence on the same surface, made closely together in time, places the two species at the lake margin, using the same habitat,\u201d said Rutgers University Professor Craig Feibel, an author of the study.\n\nFeibel, who has conducted research since 1981 in that area of northern Kenya, a rich fossil site, applied his expertise in stratigraphy and dating to demonstrate the geological antiquity of the fossils at 1.5 million years ago. He also interpreted the depositional setting of the footprint surface, narrowing down the passage of the track makers to a few hours, and showing they were formed at the very spot of soft sediments where they were found.\n\nIf the hominins didn\u2019t cross paths, they traversed the shore within hours of each other, Feibel said.\n\n\u201cFossil footprints are exciting because they provide vivid snapshots that bring our fossil relatives to life,\u201d said Kevin Hatala, the study\u2019s first author, and an associate professor of biology at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nAMAZING: Fossil of Neanderthal Child with Down\u2019s Syndrome Hints at Early Humans\u2019 Compassion\n\nProf. Hatala has been investigating hominin footprints since 2012, and says they reveal how living individuals, millions of years ago, were moving around their environments and potentially interacting with each other, or even with other animals.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that we can\u2019t really get from bones or stone tools.\u201d\n\nWhile skeletal fossils have long provided the primary evidence for studying human evolution, new data from fossil footprints are revealing fascinating details about the evolution of human anatomy and locomotion, and giving further clues about ancient human behaviors and environments.\n\nAn expert in foot anatomy, Hatala found the prints reflected different patterns of anatomy and locomotion. He and several co-authors distinguished one set of footprints from another using new methods they recently developed to enable them to conduct a 3D analysis.\n\n\u201cIn biological anthropology, we\u2019re always interested in finding new ways to extract behavior from the fossil record, and this is a great example,\u201d said Rebecca Ferrell, a program director at the National Science Foundation who helped fund this portion of the research. \u201cThe team used cutting-edge 3D imaging technologies to create an entirely new way to look at footprints, which helps us understand human evolution and the roles of cooperation and competition in shaping our evolutionary journey.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: Prehistoric \u2018Axe Factory\u2019 Found in Britain Triggers Search for More Artifacts\n\nMs. Feibel described the discovery as \u201ca bit of serendipity\u201d for researchers in 2021 organized by Louise Leakey, a third-generation paleontologist.\n\nFeibel noted it had long been hypothesized that these two human species coexisted. According to fossil records, Homo erectus, a direct ancestor of humans, persisted for 1 million years more. Paranthropus boisei, however, went extinct within the next few hundred thousand years (but scientists don\u2019t know why).\n\nBoth species possessed upright postures, bipedalism, and were highly agile. Little is yet known about how these coexisting species interacted, both culturally and reproductively.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Humble Stick Reveals Wealth of Information About Extinct Heidelberg Hominids as Hunters and Craftsmen\n\nThe footprints are significant, Feibel said, because they fall into the category of \u201ctrace fossils\u201d, which cannot be moved\u2014not part of an organism, but offering important evidence of behavior.\n\n\u201cThis proves beyond any question that not only one, but two different hominins were walking on the same surface, literally within hours of each other,\u201d Feibel said. \u201cThe idea that they lived contemporaneously may not be a surprise. But this is the first time demonstrating it. I think that\u2019s really huge.\u201d\n\nSHARE THE AMAZING SCIENCE With Paleo-Lovers on Social Media\u2026"

This surge is attributed to a 5,000% spike in its burn rate, eliminating nearly 60 million tokens in 24 hours, thereby reducing supply and potentially increasing value. Additionally, SHIB\u2019s exchange-held supply has reached a three-year low, indicating a shift towards self-custody and decreased immediate selling pressure.\n\nThe Shibarium layer-2 scaling solution has also achieved significant milestones, processing over 500 million transactions and surpassing 8 million total blocks, enhancing the ecosystem\u2019s scalability and efficiency. Analysts predict a potential 50% rally if SHIB surpasses $0.00002800, with some forecasting a surge up to $0.00022.\n\n3. PEPE Coin Rebounds After 27% Decline From Peak\n\nPepe Coin has declined over 27% from its annual peak, currently trading at $0.0000187 with a market cap exceeding $7.8 billion. Recent data indicates a 1.46% reduction in PEPE holdings on exchanges, now at 239.84 trillion tokens, suggesting increased long-term holding by investors.\n\nThis trend could decrease selling pressure, potentially driving prices higher. Additionally, significant whale activity has been observed, with a notable transaction involving the purchase of 1.01 trillion PEPE tokens worth approximately $19 million. Such large-scale acquisitions reflect growing confidence among substantial investors, which may further strengthen PEPE\u2019s price.\n\n4. Dogecoin Tests Key Resistance with $20 Potential\n\nDogecoin has achieved a year-to-date gain exceeding 400%, currently trading at $0.404, which is 45% below its 2021 all-time high of $0.7316. Crypto analysts note that DOGE is testing a critical resistance level at $0.40; a sustained break above this could propel the price to $0.43, while failure may lead to a decline to $0.36 or $0.34.\n\nPositive developments, such as the U.S. government\u2019s establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the launch of Valour\u2019s Dogecoin exchange-traded product in Sweden, have strengthened investor confidence. Predictions show a potential long-term surge to $20, citing DOGE\u2019s consistent wave patterns.\n\nThe Ultimate Best Crypto of 2024: Which One Wins the Title?\n\nThe market identifies BlockDAG as the best crypto coin to buy in 2024 for its solid growth potential that crypto enthusiasts eagerly seek. Its presale success, raising $152 million, and the 2240% surge from its initial batch price highlight its appeal in the competitive market.\n\nWith an innovative hybrid architecture seamlessly integrating scalability, security, and decentralization, BlockDAG is emerging as the ultimate hub for meme coin and NFT development, challenging established networks in the crypto space.\n\nThe broader cryptocurrency market mirrors this enthusiasm, with Shiba Inu\u2019s 40% monthly rise, Pepe Coin\u2019s increasing investor confidence, and Dogecoin\u2019s steady resistance levels showcasing promising trends. Yet, BlockDAG\u2019s unparalleled growth trajectory places it ahead of the pack.\n\nThe subject matter and the content of this article are solely the views of the author.

That transition became official back in June when VW announced a joint venture with Rivian.\n\nMeanwhile, the automaker also announced last summer it would delay the launch of a new flagship electric vehicle (EV) called Trinity, initially planned for 2026. German press reports at the time suggested the delay was to make room for none other than the next-gen electric Golf.\n\nAnd now that VW\u2019s venture with Rivian has officially kicked off earlier this month, all the pieces are coming together.\n\n\u201cWe decided on how to do the software-defined vehicle,\u201d VW CEO Thomas Schafer said during a media roundtable. \u201cIt will happen with the joint venture, where we put the new electric-electronics architecture together. But we have also decided that we want to start this journey with a more iconic product. So we\u2019ll start with the Golf.\u201d\n\nThe next-gen electric Golf is now expected for 2029, followed by Trinity in the following years.\n\nThe Volkswagen-Rivian venture first plans to use Rivian\u2019s electrical architecture and software technology stack to enable the launch of Rivian\u2019s R2 midsize SUV in the first half of 2026 and support the launch of Volkswagen models by 2027."

            "article_content": "Over the past decade, as an engineering manager, I\u2019ve seen the tech industry evolve in some ways that I never expected.\n\nThe rise of cloud computing and microservices stands out as one of the most significant shifts. These tools have revolutionized the way we build and scale systems and enable businesses to adapt to changes at a rate that were once unimaginable.\n\nAs I reflect on leading engineering teams globally, one key lesson sticks with me: the teams that find themselves most successful in this environment are those that combine good technology and solid team management.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about following the latest trends\u2014it\u2019s about designing systems that can respond to the actual needs in real time.\n\nMy name is Bharat Ramesh and I am an Engineering Leader and a Software Engineering Manager, and today, I will walk you through on how cloud computing and microservices can help your teams perform better, create innovative solutions and resolve problems that we face every day in our organizations.\n\nThe Cost of Outdated Systems in a World Demanding Speed\n\nFor years, I have seen how teams suffer from the burden of primitive methodologies. Operations that should be accomplished in minutes may consume hours, scalability remains an unattainable goal, and innovation is masked by the technical debt.\n\nThis is frustrating, draining, and let me add, untenable when the technology industry is constantly evolving.\n\nThat\u2019s where cloud computing and microservices come in. These aren\u2019t just simple terms; they are real innovations for overcoming the issues that inhibit our progress. Here\u2019s how these modern solutions tackle the most common pain points:\n\nSlow Deployment Cycles : Microservices allow updates to be deployed independently, cutting down downtime and increasing flexibility.\n\nPoor Scalability : Cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud enable on-demand resource allocation, ensuring systems can grow alongside business needs.\n\nFragile Systems : By breaking monolithic systems into smaller, self-contained components, microservices reduce the risk of one failure taking down the entire application.\n\nLimited Innovation : With infrastructure managed by cloud providers, engineering teams can focus on creating value instead of maintaining servers.\n\nThese shifts have completely transformed the way I lead engineering teams. Embracing these solutions can propel your team into the future.\n\nWhy Cloud and Microservices Are Not Just a Trend \u2013 They Are Essential\n\nWhen I began researching cloud computing and microservices, I wasn\u2019t aiming to become a part of the newest trend\u2014I was in search of solutions that would actually make a difference. And the data? It told me everything I needed to know: These technologies are not mere frills, they are necessities if a business wants to survive in today\u2019s market.\n\nHere\u2019s what stood out:\n\n85% of organizations will operate with a cloud-first principle by 2025 (Gartner), signaling that businesses are prioritizing scalability and efficiency.\n\nCompanies using microservices see up to a 175% increase in deployment frequency (xCube LABS), meaning faster features, faster fixes.\n\nBusinesses leveraging cloud platforms save up to 30% on infrastructure costs (Business Insider), freeing up resources to drive innovation.\n\nEven industry leaders like Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, emphasize this shift, saying, \u201cEvery company is a software company. You have to start thinking and operating like a digital company.\u201d That quote stuck with me because it\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve seen firsthand. So embracing these tools aren\u2019t an option anymore but essential.\n\nThese stats confirmed what I was experiencing in my own projects: cloud computing and microservices don\u2019t just solve problems\u2014they create opportunities.\n\nAddressing Common Pain Points\n\nLike any other engineering leader, I have my own set of troubles, and I\u2019m no exception. From legacy systems to defining the right pace in between speed and security, I have found out that making the right choices and leveraging cloud computing and microservices can help to transform these threats into assets. This is how I have responded to some of the most significant challenges:\n\n1. Overcoming Legacy System Bottlenecks\n\nLegacy systems can feel like anchors. They\u2019re heavy, outdated, and hold your team back. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned: you don\u2019t have to do everything at once.\n\nTake a gradual, strategic approach.\n\nFor example, when we needed to modernize a system at one company, we didn\u2019t overhaul everything. Instead, we containerized key services, tested the waters, and got early wins. Those wins built momentum and reduced the risks associated with bigger changes. The key to making this work? Constant communication with the team and stakeholders to ensure everyone understands the \u201cwhy\u201d behind each step.\n\n2. Moving Fast Without Sacrificing Security\n\nOf course, there\u2019s always a question of speed and security. However, with the right tools, we don\u2019t have to compromise one over the other. At Google we also created the CI/CD pipelines with security checks integrated. This way we were able to identify problems before release while not necessarily slowing down the process.\n\nWe made sure that in our systems, each service was independent of the other. By doing so, if one part of the system was malfunctioning, the other parts of the application continued to operate without errors. The key is to build resilience to the system, which reduces risk and increases credibility with your employees.\n\n3. Scaling on a Budget\n\nBudgets are tight, especially when you need to scale systems. But there\u2019s a smarter way to do it. During one project at Acrelec, we used serverless architecture to scale dynamically with demand. Instead of paying for unused resources, we only paid for what we needed with AWS Lambda.\n\nThis cost-effective approach freed up resources, allowing my team to focus on the stuff that really matters\u2014innovation. Plus, empowering my engineers with cloud training made a huge difference in helping them find cost-effective solutions without compromising on performance.\n\nWhy I Embrace the Cloud: Growth and Scalability with Microservices\n\nI\u2019ve not only seen this transition from traditional systems to cloud-based platforms in my work\u2014I have lived it. According to recent estimates, cloud revenue is expected to grow at a much faster rate than that of traditional systems in the coming five years up to 2025. But even beyond that, I have observed that this change affects how we design and grow systems.\n\nThis is especially true in my work where the integration of cloud computing with microservices has been of great value. Microservices allow me to break down complex applications into smaller, independent components, and the benefits are undeniable:\n\nFaster Deployments : Changes can be done on every single service and not on the whole system at once. This means that we are able to release features or patches easily and with minimal impact.\n\nScalability : I have been able to optimize certain parts of a system rather than the system as a whole and that is more desirable and cost-effective.\n\nResilience : This way if one microservice goes down the rest of the system is not impacted and the system does not degrade thus not inconveniencing the users of the system.\n\nFor example, in the previous project, we encountered variable user traffic. Rather than overloading the system or squander resources, we only scaled the required services by using native cloud technologies. It helped us save time, money and a lot of headaches.\n\nThis isn\u2019t simply a case of organizations moving to the cloud and microservices to follow the latest fad \u2013 it\u2019s about using the right tools to get the job done. Watching my teams do well in this environment has made me confident that this way of working is the way forward for software development.\n\nThe Leadership Factor: Mentorship and Empathy\n\nEngineering leadership is not just about delivering technology advances; it is about creating organizations capable of adapting to a rapidly changing world. As people start to adopt cloud computing and microservices to do their work, leadership becomes even more important.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve seen how mentorship and empathy can transform teams, especially when navigating complex transitions like adopting new technologies.\n\nHow I\u2019ve Built Mentorship Culture in My Teams\n\nI do believe that leadership has always been one of my strong suits and one of the elements I have always focused on is definitely mentorship. That is not just about transferring knowledge and skills, but to enable and mobilize people to excel and become responsible for their work. I\u2019ve been able to develop a straightforward way of cultivating a culture of mentorship within my teams. Here\u2019s how I do it:\n\nSteps How I Approach it Effect on My Team Identify Strengths I recognize each team member\u2019s unique talents and skills. Boosts confidence and encourages them to play to their strengths. Set Goals I collaborate with them to define clear, achievable objectives. Aligns personal growth with team success, fostering motivation. Provide Guidance I offer support, share insights, and provide helpful resources. Builds trust and equips the team to tackle challenges effectively. Encourage Independence I empower them to take ownership and grow through experience. Cultivates self-reliance and innovation within the team. Celebrate Progress I acknowledge achievements to boost confidence and morale. Enhances morale and creates a positive, growth-oriented culture.\n\nDuring my time at Highmark, I was able to develop a technique of mentoring junior developers while I was still in the company. I wasn\u2019t just training them in AngularJS and React; I was coaching them on how to solve most problems independently. In a world of clouds and microservices, being able to rely on team members to be able to step up and solve problems is priceless.\n\nFurthermore, during one of my projects, while we were shifting towards cloud-native solutions the whole team faced a steep learning process. Instead of pushing harder, I made sure they had the resources and time to adapt. I also made sure every milestone we achieved should be celebrated. This will surely build up morale and help the team to keep on going\n\nLooking Ahead: A Future of Cloud and AI in the Technological Industry\n\nGlancing towards the future, I firmly believe that cloud computing coupled with microservices and AI will be the game-changer. For instance, Generative AI is already being used in the generation of code and testing of the same, thus increasing the rate of delivery. I have had my first experience with these tools and the impact is clear: my teams can focus more on problem-solving while AI handles the repetitive work.\n\nDuring my time exploring cloud and AI technologies, I had the opportunity to dive into courses from Databricks, where I got insights on how these tools can be combined to improve data and pattern understanding. The possibilities for using AI to make data-driven decisions have never been greater, implementing these solutions is simpler than ever.\n\nThese are only the beginning, and I\u2019m looking forward to the future where this technology can take us.\n\nTake the Leap\n\nTechnology is an ever evolving environment and full of challenges, but with the right approach and attitude the opportunities are vast. If you are an engineering manager or a developer in the making, understanding the concept of cloud computing and microservices can help you achieve success at scale.\n\nReady to level up? First, explore and start experimenting around with some cloud platforms and start exploring microservices architecture. Join me and let\u2019s create the future of technology.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nI am Bharat Ramesh, an engineering manager with 12 years of work experience in managing innovation in web, and mobile applications.
