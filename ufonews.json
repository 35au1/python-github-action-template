            "source": "Daily Mail",
            "article_content": "A book classified by the CIA for more than 50 years contains a shocking theory about how the world will end.\n\n'The Adam and Eve Story,' written by former US Air Force employee, UFO researcher and self-acclaimed psychic Chan Thomas, was written in 1966 but its publication was halted by the agency.\n\nIt was quietly declassified in 2013, at least in part, but remained hidden in the CIA's database \u2014 until now.\n\nIn the book, Thomas claims that every 6,500 years, a major disaster on the scale of the Biblical 'Great Flood' strikes the Earth.\n\nWhile experts debate the exact date of that flood in the Book of Genesis, Thomas asserts that it happened roughly 6,500 years ago, and there is some archaeological and geological evidence to support that claim.\n\nBy that logic, Thomas argues that the next catastrophe is imminent.\n\nAs for what the end of the world will look like, Thomas believes that Earth's magnetic field will suddenly, drastically shift, wreaking havoc across the planet.\n\nThe reason behind the book was classified remains unclear, but some have suggested the agency was concerned the book would cause mass panic, or leak information related to secret government research.\n\nThomas had connections to classified projects during his time at the defunct aerospace company McDonnell Douglas. He was part of a small team of scientists assembled by the company to investigate reports of UFOs.\n\nWhile there are no official records of Thomas working directly for the CIA, the agency's secrecy agreement means past employees need to get approval before publishing books and other works of communication.\n\nA book that was classified by the CIA for more than 50 years contains a shocking theory about how the world will end (STOCK)\n\n'In California, the mountains shake like ferns in a breeze; the mighty Pacific rears back and piles up into a mountain of water more than two miles high, then starts its race eastward,' Thomas wrote in his book.\n\n'In a fraction of a day all vestiges of civilization are gone, and the great cities \u2014 Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas, New York \u2014 are nothing but legends,' he writes. 'Barely a stone is left where millions walked just a few hours before.'\n\nThe first chapter, titled 'The Next Cataclysm,' starts with: 'Like Noah's 6,500 years ago... Like Adam and Eve's 11,500 years ago... This, too will come to pass...'\n\nThe cryptic opening suggests that the next cataclysm is poised to occur any day now.\n\nThe book features 55 pages, but Thomas wrote more than 200. The rest are still kept top-secret to this day. And the reason for the CIA's involvement remains a mystery.\n\nThe apocalyptical tale begins with the destruction of California, explaining how winds 'with the force of a thousand armies' will shred everything in sight with its 'supersonic bombardment,' as the Pacific tsunami drowns Los Angeles and San Francisco 'as if they were but grains of sand.'\n\nThomas claims these impacts will overtake the entire North American continent 'within three hours,' as an earthquake simultaneously creates massive cracks in the ground that allow magma to rise to the surface.\n\n'The Adam and Eve Story,' written by Chan Thomas, was published in 1966 and partly declassified in 2013\n\nThe book's author Chan Thomas was a former US Air Force employee, UFO researcher and self-acclaimed psychic\n\nBut it won't just be North America that is swallowed by the destruction.\n\nNone of the seven continents will be able to escape the onslaught, Thomas writes, with each one experiencing slightly different versions of the same dramatic end.\n\nBy the seventh day, 'the horrendous rampage is over,' and the entire Earth has changed, he writes.\n\n'The Bay of Bengal basin, just east of India, is now at the North Pole. The Pacific Ocean, just west of Peru, is at the South Pole,' Thomas explains.\n\nEven Greenland and Antarctica have been thrown toward the equator, and 'find their ice caps dissolving madly in the tropical heat.'\n\nThomas paints a terrifying picture of civilization-destroying climate change and tectonic rearrangement. But there is no scientific evidence to suggest that such a cataclysm is possible.\n\n'It's just unfortunate that these things are being put out there,' Martin Mlynczak, a senior research scientist at the NASA Langley Research Center, told The Verge.\n\n'Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. And there's no proof and no science and no physics behind any of the claims about the magnetic field change being associated with climate change.'\n\nWhat's more, there is no evidence to suggest that the Earth's magnetic field ever has, or ever will, make the 90-degree flip that Thomas describes.\n\nEarth's magnetic poles do shift, and have done so hundreds of times throughout the planet's history. But this never causes the kind of widespread devastation that Thomas described\n\nThomas states that the last catastrophe of this nature \u2014 Noah's Biblical flood \u2014 happened 6,500 years ago, and that this means we're due for the next one. But this date is contested\n\n'That is totally bogus. If that's what happened every 6,500 years, we would certainly see it; it would be in all the records... The amount of energy to bring that about is tremendous. And you know, there's nothing to initiate it,' Mlynczak said.\n\nThat said, Earth's magnetic poles do shift and have done so hundreds of times throughout the planet's history, according to NASA.\n\nThis phenomenon is called a 'pole reversal.' Paleomagnetic records suggest it occurs about every 300,000 years on average, though the actual time intervals vary widely.\n\n'During a pole reversal, the magnetic field weakens, but it doesn\u2019t completely disappear,' NASA states.\n\n'The magnetosphere, together with Earth\u2019s atmosphere, continue protecting Earth from cosmic rays and charged solar particles, though there may be a small amount of particulate radiation that makes it down to Earth\u2019s surface.\n\n'The magnetic field becomes jumbled, and multiple magnetic poles can emerge in unexpected places.'\n\nBut this never causes the kind of widespread devastation that Thomas described in his book.\n\nEven if his theory about why and how the world will end had scientific merit, there would still be reason to question his claim that the apocalypse is imminent.\n\nHe states that the last catastrophe of this nature \u2014 Noah's Biblical flood \u2014 happened 6,500 years ago, and that this means we're due for the next one.\n\nThere is some geological and archaeological evidence to suggest that date may be correct. For example, a 2006 study claimed that 6,500-year-old wood recovered from the 'landing site of Noah's ark' was actually part of the ark itself.\n\nBut the wood's age has been challenged by other experts.\n\nThe more widely accepted date-range for the flood is between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago. If this event truly occurred during that time, then Thomas' estimated timing for the end of the world would be more than 1,000 years off.\n\nTherefore, all the evidence suggests that the violent disaster detailed in 'The Adam and Eve Story' will not actually come to pass."

            "article_content": "Nvidia stock has been one of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in the past couple of years, clocking remarkable gains of nearly 800% over the past two years on account of the red-hot demand for its data center graphics cards, but the past three months have been difficult for the chipmaker.\n\nShares of the semiconductor giant are down 1% over the past three months. That's a bit surprising considering that Nvidia delivered an outstanding set of results during this period that beat Wall Street's expectations. What's more, Nvidia's guidance was also better than what analysts were looking for.\n\nHowever, concerns about Nvidia's ability to sustain its outstanding growth, its valuation, and the short-term margin pressure that will be created by the ramp-up of its latest generation of Blackwell processors seem to be weighing on the company's stock price. Meanwhile, two other little-known chip companies have received a big boost in the past three months thanks to the positive impact of AI on their businesses: Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA) and Lumentum Holdings (NASDAQ: LITE).\n\nWhile Ambarella stock has jumped 25% in the past three months, Lumentum has appreciated nearly 23%. Their gains have been better than what Nvidia has delivered during this period, and the good part is that the AI-focused growth drivers of both of the smaller chipmakers are just kicking in.\n\nLet's check out how AI is turning out to be a catalyst for Ambarella and Lumentum.\n\n1. Ambarella\n\nThe chips that Ambarella designs are deployed in automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The company is primarily known for its computer vision chips that process images and video, and it is now finding applications in the field of AI as well. According to one estimate, the size of the AI computer vision processor market could grow from $17.2 billion in 2023 to $45.7 billion in 2028 thanks to the growing demand from multiple verticals such as automotive, security and surveillance, and consumer electronics applications.\n\nAmbarella's product portfolio already includes chips capable of processing AI workloads in these applications. For instance, the company's CV5 processor that's based on an advanced 5-nanometer (nm) process node can run AI-based algorithms in automotive cameras, consumer cameras, and even robotics. Not surprisingly, the company is witnessing an increase in demand for this processor.\n\nCEO Fermi Wang remarked on the company's November 2024 earnings conference call that its new higher-priced AI inference processors, such as the CV5, are driving record AI revenue and also contributing toward a higher average selling price (ASP). The good part is that Ambarella expects the robust demand for CV5 to continue in fiscal 2026, which will begin next month. Additionally, the company estimates that the demand for its CV7 family of AI vision processors will pick up from the new fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues"

This finding was published in Nature Astronomy.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nPalomar 5\n\nPalomar 5 is a unique star cluster that stretches across 30,000 light-years and is located about 80,000 light-years from Earth. While globular clusters like Palomar 5 are typically dense, spherical groups of stars, Palomar 5 stands out because of its loose, spread-out formation and long tidal stream\u2014a vast river of stars trailing behind it. These stellar streams were hard to detect in the past, but with the help of Gaia, a space observatory mapping the Milky Way with incredible precision, astronomers are now discovering more of them.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan launches first EO-1 satellite but internet is laughing at it. Here's why\n\nAdvertisment\n\nResearchers led by Gieles used advanced simulations to study how the stars in Palomar 5 might have spread out to form this tidal stream. They found that the cluster's stars were likely pushed into the stream by the gravitational pull of black holes. These black holes, which are created when massive stars collapse, interact with the cluster\u2019s stars and send them careening away. The simulations also showed that the number of black holes in Palomar 5 is higher than expected, helping explain the current structure of the cluster.\n\nAlso Read | What's life post TikTok ban? Here's what US should learn from India\n\nThe discovery that black holes are common in globular clusters is exciting for astronomers. These regions are thought to be the birthplace of many black hole mergers, which occur when black holes collide. These mergers are important because they can help scientists learn about the elusive \"middleweight\" black holes\u2014those that are bigger than stellar-mass black holes but smaller than the supermassive ones at the centres of galaxies.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAstrophysicist Fabio Antonini, of Cardiff University, says, \"It is believed that a large fraction of binary black hole mergers form in star clusters.\""

            "article_content": "Sam Altman Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nOpenAI, as you likely know, is one of tech\u2019s biggest unicorns.\n\nA group of entrepreneurs and researchers, including Elon Musk and the company\u2019s current CEO Sam Altman, founded the artificial intelligence company in 2015. Today, OpenAI is valued at a whopping $157 billion \u2014 putting it on par with the market capitalizations of public companies like AT&T, Goldman Sachs and Uber, per The Wall Street Journal. Its flagship offering, ChatGPT, launched in 2022, and today reportedly has 250 million weekly users and 11 million paid subscribers.\n\nAmong OpenAI\u2019s investors are Microsoft, which invested $13 billion in the company, Nvidia, which invested $100 million and SoftBank, to the tune of $1.5 billion. In October, OpenAI received a $4 billion credit line \u2014 with the option to extend it another $2 billion \u2014 from JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, UBS and other institutional investors.\n\nBut OpenAI hasn\u2019t turned a profit. The company projected $5 billion in losses on $3.7 billion in revenue for 2024. It announced at the end of the year it would change its corporate structure, essentially going from a nonprofit to a company with investors and the potential for stock shares. \"We once again need to raise more capital than we\u2019d imagined,\" OpenAI\u2019s board wrote in a statement.\n\nAltman has since said the company is losing money on its $200-per-month Pro subscriptions, which offer limitless access to its most recent model, OpenAI o1, and to its video generator, Sora AI. \"People use it much more than we expected,\" he wrote in a post on X. The company\u2019s biggest cost, according to The New York Times, is powering the supercomputers that run its AI.\n\nIn a 6,000-word Q&A with Altman, Bloomberg inquired how the company prices \"technology that\u2019s never existed before.\" \"Is it market research?\" the publication asked. \"A finger in the wind?\"\n\n\"We launched ChatGPT for free, and then people started using it a lot, and we had to have some way to pay for it,\" Altman said. He said the company tested two prices for its most popular product, ChatGPT Plus: $20 and $42. Users didn\u2019t like the $42 price point, Altman said, so the company picked $20.\n\n\"It was not a rigorous \u2018hire someone and do a pricing study\u2019 thing,\" Altman said.\n\nIf history tells us much, the vast dollars-and-cents discrepancy between what investors think OpenAI is worth and the company\u2019s profits, or lack thereof, doesn\u2019t spell doom. OpenAI is far from the first tech brand to score a sky-high valuation from financial institutions despite not generating any financial returns. In 2017, roughly 76% of the companies that went public were unprofitable the year before, CNBC reported.\n\nStory Continues"

Ms Kapoor was recording her statement with the Bandra Police.\n\n\"The attacker was aggressive. I saw him attack Saif repeatedly...Our priority was to take Saif to the hospital,\" she told the police.\n\nThe actor further mentioned that the attacker ran from the spot and did not take any valuables with him.\n\nAccording to her, Mr Khan was trying to protect their children Taimur and Jehangir (also known as Jeh). When the attacker could not reach Jeh, he attacked Mr Khan multiple times, she said.\n\nHours after the incident, terrified Ms Kapoor went to her sister Karisma's house and Mr Khan underwent surgery.\n\n\"After the attack, I was terrified, so Karisma took me to her house,\" she said.\n\nAlso Read | Dark Skin, Slim Build: Nanny Describes Intruder Who Attacked Saif Ali Khan\n\nMr Khan sustained serious injuries after he was stabbed six times by an intruder at his residence in Mumbai's Bandra area on Thursday. The incident took place when the accused allegedly entered Mr Khan's house on the 11th floor of the Satguru Sharan building for a burglary. Left bleeding after the attack, Mr Khan was rushed to a nearby hospital where he underwent surgery as his spinal fluid leaked out after shards of the attacker's knife lodged into his spine.\n\nDoctors at the Lilavati Hospital - where Mr Khan is undergoing treatment - said that Mr Khan is recovering well post-surgery. He is likely to be discharged in a couple of days, sources said.\n\nWhat initial investigation revealed\n\nAccording to preliminary investigation, the attacker's breaking in at Mr Khan's house lasted for nearly 30 minutes. Police sources said that the intruder had scaled the wall of an adjacent compound to enter the premises. He was familiar with the layout of the building and took the stairs on the rear side of the building to reach the floor where the actor lives and entered the house through the fire escape, they added.\n\nA nurse caring for Jeh Eliyama Philips was the first one to encounter the intruder who stabbed Mr Khan. According to her, he demanded Rs 1 crore before Mr Khan intervened.\n\nTwo CCTV footage have emerged so far showing the man who stabbed Mr Khan.\n\nAlso Read | New Videos Emerge Of Saif Ali Khan's Attacker, He's Seen Buying Headphones\n\nIn one of the videos, the accused - who had his face covered and was carrying a bag - can be seen climbing the stairs before entering the actor's house. In another footage from the building's sixth floor, the intruder was seen taking the stairs while fleeing after the incident. He was not seen thereafter.\n\nOver 30 statements recorded, no arrests yet\n\nThe Mumbai police have recorded statements of over 30 people in connection with the attack, including a carpenter who worked at Mr Khan's place two days before the incident. One person was also detained on Friday, but released hours later as he had nothing to do with the attack, police said.\n\nNo arrest has been made so far in the case.\n\nThe cops have formed 20 teams, along with 10 teams from the Crime Branch, to investigate the case. CCTV footage from the Bandra area has also been seized."

            "article_content": "Seven-year-old electric vehicle startup Canoo has filed for bankruptcy and will \u201ccease operations immediately.\u201d The company is liquidating its assets in a Chapter 7 proceeding in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court.\n\nThe company said in a press release published late Friday that it was \u201cin discussions with foreign sources of capital\u201d that proved unsuccessful, and also singled out an inability to secure funding from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Loan Program Office, which has been on a lending spree in the waning days of the Biden administration.\n\nCanoo said in its bankruptcy filing (and the filings for its subsidiaries) that it owes money to hundreds of creditors, and that it has more than $164 million in total liabilities. It claimed around $126 million in assets.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing comes just a few weeks after Canoo furloughed the remainder of its workers and idled its factory in Oklahoma. The company struggled throughout 2024 to get more than a few of its electric vans into the hands of prospective customers, and suffered numerous executive departures. It had just $700,000 in the bank in mid-November.\n\nCanoo is the latest EV startup to go bankrupt after merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) as a shortcut to going public. Electric Last Mile Solutions was the first in June 2022. But since then, Fisker, Lordstown Motors, Proterra, Lion Electric, and Arrival all filed for different levels of bankruptcy protection in their various home countries. (Canoo bought Arrival\u2019s assets out of insolvency in 2024, though it\u2019s unclear if it ever put any of it to use.)\n\nCanoo announced plans to merge with SPAC Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. in August 2020, and went public that following December, raising around $600 million. In the years since it went public, the company made a small number of its bubbly electric vans and handed them over to partners \u2014 some paying \u2014 willing to trial the vehicles. The United States Postal Service, Department of Defense, and NASA all have or had Canoo vehicles.\n\nAt one point, the company even courted Walmart, which agreed to purchase as many as 10,000 EVs from Canoo in 2022. But the deal was essentially non-binding and bore little risk for the retail giant.\n\nCanoo was founded in late 2017 by a splinter group of executives that were fed up with the drama surrounding the other EV startup where they worked at the time, Faraday Future. Originally called Evelozcity, those executives developed a modular electric vehicle platform that could power cabins in multiple shapes and sizes, and utilized advanced technology like a steer-by-wire system.\n\nThe ideas inside Canoo were attractive enough that the startup at one point was in talks with Apple, which was interested in a potential investment or even acquisition as a way to boost the tech giant\u2019s own secretive electric car project. Former CTO and at one point CEO of Canoo, Ulrich Kranz, went on to help run Apple\u2019s car project before it was disbanded in 2024.\n\nBut Canoo underwent numerous pivots after it went public and gained a new chairman and CEO in Tony Aquila, who had invested in the company prior to the merger.\n\nA serial entrepreneur, Aquila immediately refocused Canoo away from selling to consumers and prioritized commercial fleets. On his watch, Canoo repeatedly changed plans on whether it would build its own electric vehicles or outsource the work. At one point Canoo, announced it was moving its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas \u2014 the home of Walmart \u2014 but then never really followed through. Instead, the company spent years trying to stand up multiple manufacturing facilities in Oklahoma.\n\nAquila\u2019s own financial firm appeared to benefit from his post atop the company. In 2023, Canoo spent double its meager revenue to Aquila\u2019s firm to pay for the use of its corporate jet. Canoo also rented office space from Aquila\u2019s firm, according to regulatory filings.\n\nIt was also Aquila\u2019s firm that kept Canoo alive in recent months. The firm loaned Canoo a few million dollars to keep the lights on dating back to October. Those loans were secured by a \u201cfirst priority lien and security interest\u201d on the equipment located at the Canoo\u2019s Oklahoma City facility.\n\nSigns of a bankruptcy were bubbling up all week. Reddit users noticed that the company\u2019s billboard outside its office in Justin, Texas had been taken down. Multiple employees who were on furlough told TechCrunch that they received official termination notices. Some people who had placed $100 deposits when the company was still planning on selling to regular customers had started to get refunds.\n\nThis story has been updated with new information about Canoo\u2019s total creditors, assets, and liabilities."

            "article_content": "The Apache Software Foundation has recently announced the general availability of Apache Hudi 1.0, the transactional data lake platform with support for near real-time analytics. Initially introduced in 2017, Apache Hudi provides an open table format optimized for efficient writes in incremental data pipelines and fast query performance.\n\nOriginally developed at Uber as an incremental processing framework on Apache Hadoop and submitted to the Apache Software Foundation in 2019, Hudi is designed to bridge the gap between database-like functionality and open data lakehouse architectures. Hudi\u2019s main strength lies in its ability to support both near real-time and batch queries simultaneously.\n\nThe latest release introduces new features aimed at transforming data lakehouses into what the project community considers a fully-fledged \"Data Lakehouse Management System\" (DLMS). Vinoth Chandar, creator of the Hudi Project at Uber and CEO at Onehouse, writes:\n\nHudi shines by providing a high-performance open table format as well as a comprehensive open-source software stack that can ingest, store, optimize and effectively self-manage a data lakehouse. This distinction between open formats and open software is often lost in translation inside the large vendor ecosystem in which Hudi operates. Still, it has been and remains a key consideration for Hudi\u2019s users to avoid compute-lockin to any given data vendor.\n\nReleased under an Apache License 2.0, Hudi 1.0 introduces a new secondary indexing system designed to enhance query performance and reduce data scanning costs. Users can now create SQL-based indexes on secondary columns, significantly speeding up query execution. The release also includes expression-based indexing, similar to a feature in PostgreSQL, which replaces traditional partitioning strategies to enable more flexible and efficient data organization. When the preview was announced last year, Boris Litvak, principal software engineer at Snyk, wrote:\n\nAmong the big 3 ACID storage formats on Object Storage, Apache Hudi 1.0 (beta) is the first one introducing \"functional indexes\" over the data. We usually call it \"secondary indexes\" in SQL DB jargon. When will Delta.io and Apache Iceberg follow?\n\nSource: Apache Hudi Blog\n\nThe release introduces support for partial updates, which improves storage and compute efficiency by allowing updates to specific fields instead of entire rows. Additionally, non-blocking concurrency control enables multiple streaming jobs to write to the same dataset without causing bottlenecks or failures. Discussing the database architecture, Chandar adds:\n\nRegarding full-fledged DLMS functionality, the closest experience Hudi 1.0 offers is through Apache Spark. Users can deploy a Spark server (or Spark Connect) with Hudi 1.0 installed, submit SQL/jobs, orchestrate table services via SQL commands, and enjoy new secondary index functionality to speed up queries like a DBMS.\n\nHudi 1.0 introduces enhancements to the storage engine, including the adoption of a log-structured merge (LSM) tree for efficient timeline management. This supports long-term data retention and ensures high-performance query planning, even for datasets containing billions of records. Bhavani Sudha Saktheeswaran, software engineer at Onehouse and Apache Hudi PMC, comments:\n\nWhether you're building an open data platform, streaming into the data lakehouse, moving away from data warehouses, or optimizing for high-performance queries, Hudi 1.0.0 makes it easier than ever to work with lakehouses.\n\nSaktheeswaran and Saketh Chintapalli, software engineer at Uber, presented a session on incremental data processing with Apache Hudi at QCon San Francisco. The session recording is available on InfoQ."

            "article_content": "Obesity can lead to several lifestyle diseases. Reducing weight to the optimum level can help prevent several diseases. Once someone becomes obese, it is tough to lose weight. If someone knows about the risk of becoming obese, they can take corrective measures.\n\nWoxsen University Researchers, along with US scientists, developed an AI-based prediction model to detect what they call \u2018Obesity Risk\u2019.\n\nThe team, which includes Shahid Mohammad Ganie, Hemachandran Kannan, and Bobba Bharath Reddy, along with Manjeet Rege, a professor at the University of St. Thomas, USA, have explored how combining multiple machine learning methods can predict the risk of obesity based on lifestyle data.\n\nThey introduced an AI-based prediction model that leverages boosting techniques to assess the risk of obesity more effectively.\n\nTheir research paper, \u2018An Investigation of Ensemble Learning Techniques for Obesity Risk Prediction Using Lifestyle Data,\u2019 was published in the Decision Analytics Journal by Elsevier.\n\n\u201cIdentifying the underlying causes of obesity risk in its early stages has become a challenge for medical practitioners,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always been to use technology to create meaningful solutions to real-world problems. By focusing on lifestyle factors and ensemble learning methods, we aim to provide healthcare professionals with actionable insights while empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their well-being,\u201d Hemachandran Kannan said.\n\nThe researchers observed that while BMI (body mass index) is commonly used as the primary indicator of obesity risk, it has limitations in capturing the full complexity of obesity, which is influenced by behavioural, environmental, and genetic factors.\n\n\u201cThey noted that BMI does not account for critical health indicators such as muscle mass, fat distribution, or other variables, potentially reducing the precision of obesity classification,\u201d they argued.\n\n\u201cOur study highlighted that while some machine learning models for obesity classification incorporate lifestyle factors, sex, and 3D body scans without relying solely on BMI, the datasets used in these models often stem from smaller sample sizes in specific regions or countries,\u201d they said.\n\nThis limited scope restricts the models\u2019 ability to generalise findings to broader or global populations.\n\nThe study also noted that the perfect climate for obesity to flourish has been created by traditional diets heavy in processed foods and low physical activity as technology develops and urbanisation picks up speed. The resultant effects include an increase in disorders linked to obesity, such as diabetes, heart problems, and other ailments.\n\nThe researchers utilised a publicly available dataset drawn from diverse populations in countries like Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. The dataset incorporated factors such as eating habits, age, sex, physical condition, water and alcohol consumption, and the frequency of vegetable intake.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

Moscow called the attack retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, which in recent weeks appear to have intensified.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said that four ballistic missiles and 39 attack drones had been launched in the assault and that two of the ballistic missiles had been shot down in the Kyiv region. Although the city comes under drone attack almost nightly, ballistic missile launches targeting the capital are less frequent.\n\nThe pre-dawn attack ruptured a water main near the city center, sending water cascading through the streets around the battered facade of the Lukianivska subway station. Nearby, smoke was rising from a charred van with at least two burned bodies inside."

            "article_content": "Britain\u2019s medics are rewriting their plans for a full-scale war as they learn lessons from the conflict in Ukraine, a leading NHS trauma surgeon has said.\n\nEvolutions in drone warfare and a return of First World War-style superbugs have presented new challenges as Western countries take steps to put their health systems on a war-footing, according to Dr Shehan Hettiaratchy.\n\nDr Hettiaratchy, the lead trauma surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare, suggested the NHS would have to be all but shut down to only deal with war casualties if Britain was to be dragged into a full-scale conflict.\n\nHe warned the health service would also be worse off compared to its European counterparts because it lacks the same headroom to expand, unlike France and Germany.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast year, General Sir Roland Walker, the head of the Army, warned Britain must be ready to fight a war against Russia in three years.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really hard to prepare\u2026 I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s not possible to prepare, because the Ukrainians weren\u2019t prepared and the Ukrainian military clearly had spent a lot of time thinking hard about if there was to be an invasion from Belarus, from Russia,\u201d Dr Hettiaratchy said on the fringes of a DGA Group event with the UK and Ukrainian governments in support of Kyiv\u2019s healthcare system.\n\n\u201cIf we get to a scenario where we are having that level of casualties and that kind of war-fighting, the health system would be only doing that. That\u2019s where we\u2019re scaled at now,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf you look at us compared to other European countries \u2013 Covid showed it \u2013 we have less capacity, less redundancy in our health system compared to other European partners.\u201d\n\nInjured soldiers are treated in a hospital bus in Donetsk. Experts say Ukraine was not ready to handle the number of casualties despite having time to prepare - Anadolu/Getty\n\nThe event held at the British ambassador\u2019s residence called for governments to do more work with private businesses to support Ukraine\u2019s war-stricken healthcare system.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDr Hettiaratchy has been working to train Ukrainian surgeons since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nHe said the challenges faced by his Ukrainian counterparts were entirely different to those faced by Western medics in Afghanistan, where he served as a combat surgeon with the British military.\n\nThe sheer number of Russian drones and Ukraine\u2019s lack of air superiority means Kyiv\u2019s combat medics don\u2019t enjoy the same luxuries experienced by Nato armies in the Middle East.\n\nWestern troops knew that in order to save as many of the injured as possible they had to get the casualties back to the field hospital at Camp Bastion within the \u201cGolden Hour\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat is great if you\u2019ve got a helicopter which can fly you back to a hospital, back to a surgeon, back to someone like me,\u201d Dr Hettiaratchy said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe problem you have in Ukraine is you don\u2019t have that scenario because of the lack of air superiority, because of drone warfare.\u201d\n\nThe number of drones and a lack of armoured personnel carriers mean Ukrainian medics are often unable to evacuate wounded troops from the frontlines for hours.\n\nThis has led to a rise in the number of amputations carried out on casualties who were strapped up with tourniquets, which are used to stop life-threatening bleeding.\n\n\u201cThese people have tourniquets on for five, 12, 24 hours, because they can\u2019t be moved back to the next line of medical support, which means they are having a high level of amputation,\u201d Dr Hettiaratchy said.\n\nHealth risks change in line with new weapons\n\nThe use of tourniquets has triggered a long-term challenge for Ukrainians who survive an initial attack. This is because when the blood circulation is cut off by the medical device, the wounded muscle starts to die and releases poison into the rest of the body.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re having a much higher rate than we would have seen before of kidney injuries, and this is how warfare changes,\u201d the surgeon added.\n\nKeir Starmer visits a hospital in Ukraine in January to shore up support for Kyiv three years after the war started - CARL COURT/AFP\n\nDr Hettiaratchy has been training Ukrainian surgeons in London as well as travelling to Western Ukraine to help improve their skills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see how they have responded and developed and grown their capabilities and their capacity to meet the challenge,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe number of casualties they\u2019ve got coming through, the types of casualties, the challenges they are facing are things we\u2019ve not seen \u2013 because we haven\u2019t had this kind of peer-on-peer fighting between two equally matched military powers going at it \u2013 since the Second World War.\u201d\n\nDespite offering his contemporaries high praise, Dr Hettiaratchy said Ukraine\u2019s healthcare system has \u201ccritical gaps\u201d which need addressing, including a lack of types of surgeons, nurses, therapists and infection control.\n\nAntibiotic-resistant superbugs\n\nHe said Western planners would have to consult First World War history books to adapt to the emergence of superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got bugs that are not cured by antibiotics. What they are describing is going back almost to the First World War, pre-antibiotic-era of surgery,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThese people now have wounds that are uncontrolled, infections are uncontrolled and uncontrollable with antibiotics, and you have to revert to First World War techniques.\u201d\n\nSpeaking before Britain unveiled \u00a3100 million in funding for Ukraine\u2019s health system, Dr Hettiaratchy urged Western governments to improve their offerings of non-lethal aid for Ukraine.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, revealed in December that almost 400,000 Ukrainian troops had been wounded since the start of the war.\n\nThe surgeon warned these would become a generational burden on the Ukrainian state if more isn\u2019t done to pick up the mantle of almost three years of brutal conflict.\n\n\u201cThere is an absolute economic society component to make sure society functions afterwards, because the volume is so high,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that Ukrainian society picks up the mantle of dealing with the consequences of their years of war, fighting, which are going to be human costs as well as other infrastructure costs\u2026 the human cost is the one that kind of almost endures and probably has the most consequence, because it\u2019s a lifetime burden.\u201d\n\nThis support must come from foreign governments and private companies, Dr Hettiaratchy said.\n\nOne of the ways businesses could help is by innovating production techniques of creating prosthetics with 3D printers to manufacture them much faster to meet demand, he added.\n\nAt least 50,000 Ukrainians have lost limbs in nearly three years of war according to the country\u2019s health ministry.\n\nDr Hettiaratchy concluded: \u201cClearly, no one has the experience that Ukraine has in terms of volume and how wide it\u2019s affected, but there are things we can do to help them understand how to tackle the problem. In many ways, they can\u2019t afford to mess this up, because the scale is so large if they get it wrong.\u201d\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

            "article_content": "Putting aside that argument, there are certainly some diplomatic opportunities Mr. Trump can seize, though history and ominous recent warnings suggest that he may soften up his adversaries and his allies with threats of military action if he doesn\u2019t get what he wants. (See: Iran, Greenland, Panama.)\n\nHere is a scorecard to keep handy in the first few months.\n\nIn the fog of war, a potential Ukraine deal\n\nThere is very little evidence that Mr. Putin is eager for a deal that would extract him from a war that has already cost Russia nearly 200,000 dead and more than half a million wounded. But the assumption is that he must be looking for an off-ramp. Since his televised debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Mr. Trump has been promising just that \u2014 a deal \u201cin 24 hours,\u201d or even one completed before he takes the oath of office.\n\nNow, unsurprisingly, it looks a little more complicated. His special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, an 80-year-old retired general who served on Mr. Trump\u2019s first National Security Council, told Fox recently \u201clet\u2019s set it at 100 days\u201d to make sure a \u201csolution is solid, it\u2019s sustainable, and that this war ends so that we stop the carnage.\u201d Mr. Trump has said he will meet Mr. Putin \u201csoon,\u201d a notable timing, particularly because Mr. Biden has not talked to the Russian leader in nearly three years.\n\nWhat might a deal look like? First, most Biden and Trump officials acknowledge, at least in private, that Russia would most likely keep its forces in the roughly 20 percent of Ukraine it now occupies \u2014 as part of an armistice similar to the one that halted, but did not end, the Korean War in 1953. The harder part of any agreement is the security accord. Who would guarantee that Mr. Putin wouldn\u2019t use the halt in the fighting to rearm, recruit and train new forces, learn from the mistakes of the past three years, and re-invade?\n\nJake Sullivan, Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser, argues that the Biden team spent the past year \u201cputting the architecture in place\u201d to provide for that security. But Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, is suspicious that it\u2019s all talk. Remembering that no one paid much attention to the 1994 security agreement that Ukraine signed with the U.S., Britain and Russia, among others, he says only NATO membership will keep Mr. Putin from attacking again."

            "article_content": "What silently pulls the levers and gives liquidity to markets? Automation and complex algorithms trade securities at a blistering speed, shaping financial exchanges \u2013 and investors can use this algorithmic trading to their advantage.\n\nHere, Telegraph Money explains what algorithmic trading is and how it works in live markets.\n\nSimply, algorithmic trading is the use of computer functions to automatically make trades in financial markets.\n\nThe algorithms are pre-programmed to execute buy and sell orders based on certain variables, or a set of variables, taking place without human intervention.\n\nIn forex markets, roughly 90pc of trades are done using algorithms. In equities, roughly 60-75pc of trades in American, European and Asian capital markets are done through pre-programmed functions.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAn individual or, as is predominantly the case, an institutional investor will use automated algorithmic strategies to execute trades.\n\nInstitutional investors dominate the space through sheer position size, placing large trades to reduce transaction costs.\n\nGiven that size, one large trade from a hedge fund or investment bank has the ability to disrupt the market. Algorithmic trading can break up that trade into smaller increments to be deployed at coordinated times.\n\nFor instance, an order of 1 million shares would send a strong signal to the market, whereas an algorithm trading instruction of 1,000 shares every 15 seconds is more palatable and, in some cases, less noticeable.\n\nInitially, algorithmic trading can appear daunting. Indeed historically, trading platforms required a knowledge of coding to build the algorithms.\n\nNow, platforms cater for those with minimal coding experience and a degree in computer programming isn\u2019t necessary.\n\nTo use it, the first step is to gain an understanding of common algorithmic strategies, such as trend-following, mean reversion, high-frequency trading and arbitrage (more on these later).\n\nThen develop a strategy based on data and knowledge of the market. Consider: how will the algorithm react to certain trading signals? What has to happen for it to place orders according to those signals?\n\nBacktesting the algorithm \u2013 that is testing it using historical data \u2013 may not be necessary for a pre-existing algorithm. That said, thorough testing of how the algorithm works and its suitability for live markets is key.\n\nLike all trading strategies, implementing good risk management, like stop-losses, position sizing and diversification, is essential."

            "article_content": "The inauguration of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last Friday ushers in a new chapter for Venezuela, marked by deep socioeconomic wounds. The ongoing financial crisis \u2014 arguably the population\u2019s greatest source of discontent \u2014 persists despite a modest reactivation of consumption. Crisis and political conflict remain intertwined, and after a decade of catastrophic governance and escalating tensions between the ruling party and the opposition, the Maduro government now faces an especially turbulent period.\n\nThe evidence of electoral fraud, which Maduro has been unable to convincingly refute, have heightened international pressure. Both the United States and the European Union have stepped up sanctions, and Maduro is bracing for a new wave of isolation. As in the past, this isolation is likely to exacerbate the nation\u2019s economic struggles.\n\nThe start of Maduro\u2019s new mandate follows three years of moderate economic recovery, a relative improvement considering the depths from which Venezuela has emerged. This recovery was preceded by a historic economic contraction that drastically altered the nation\u2019s landscape over the past decade. Amid this unprecedented economic crisis \u2014 exacerbated by the political isolation of Chavismo \u2014 in 2020, the Maduro government began to distance itself from the statist orthodoxy outlined in the Plan de la Patria, its flagship economic program. Instead, it adopted a series of market-oriented reforms in an effort to stabilize the economy.\n\nThe partial dollarization of the monetary system, the introduction of new exchange and fiscal policies, a more business-friendly stance, and a shift in the treatment of international capital have led to a reduction in year-on-year inflation, a recovery in purchasing power, and some improvement in trade. However, the damage to Venezuela\u2019s productive and social fabric had already been done. The socioeconomic collapse experienced between 2014 and 2020, during Maduro\u2019s presidency, delivered a devastating blow to the nation\u2019s economic framework. This trauma has left many Venezuelans struggling to fully recover from its far-reaching effects.\n\nDuring the years of strict economic controls, company takeovers, conflicts with capital, and excessive bureaucratization, Venezuela\u2019s economy contracted by more than 80%. The local industrial sector was decimated, and now operates at just 30% of its capacity. Thousands of businesses went bankrupt. A wave of nationalizations severely undermined the country\u2019s ability to respond to economic challenges. Hyperinflation, which peaked at an astronomical 9,500% in 2019, wreaked havoc on the economy, devastating the financial stability of millions. Meanwhile, the oil industry, once the backbone of Venezuela\u2019s economy, collapsed under the weight of a fixed exchange rate policy and pervasive corruption in the state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Income poverty doubled, and now affects an estimated 80% of the population, according to the Venezuelan Academy of Economic Sciences (ANCE).\n\nAccording to the ANCE, the current level of income poverty in Venezuela is 2.6 times higher than the Latin American average. Income distribution is also among the most unequal in the region, with the wealthiest 10% controlling 37% of the nation\u2019s income.\n\nThe crisis of the past decade left profound scars: wages were decimated, prices soared, shortages of essential goods became widespread, and public services deteriorated dramatically. This collapse triggered a mass exodus of millions of Venezuelans, many of whom fled the country on foot, seeking refuge across South America.\n\nIn 2015, the Central Bank of Venezuela, under Maduro\u2019s control, stopped publishing monthly economic data. Media censorship also worsened. The ruling party\u2019s popularity, which began to decline in 2014, has not recovered since. In 2019 and 2020, the national economy displayed metrics comparable to those of a war-torn nation, with GDP contracting by a staggering 30 percentage points, according to estimates from private consulting firms.\n\nThe popular social assistance programs created by the Chavista government \u2014 such as the Barrio Adentro preventive health initiative, the Mi Casa Bien Equipada goods transfer program, Mercal\u2019s cheap food markets, and the Cuban-assisted Comprehensive Diagnostic Centers \u2014 collapsed during the crisis, largely due to widespread corruption among government officials.\n\nThe minimum monthly wage, traditionally around $400, has dropped to just $3. The government provides periodic bonuses every four weeks, but without retroactive benefits, these only raise the effective minimum wage to $150 per month.\n\nInternational sanctions, particularly from the United States, were introduced in 2016 in response to the political crisis driven by popular discontent. These sanctions significantly restricted Maduro\u2019s ability to explore alternative trade options or revitalize the oil industry. The global search for new markets, spurred by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, fostered a period of cautious d\u00e9tente between Caracas and Washington, leading to a modest revival in the oil sector. However, with the return of Donald Trump to the White House, it is likely that sanctions on Venezuelan oil will tighten further.\n\nNational revenues, heavily reliant on crude oil extraction, hit a critical low point in the last decade, with production dropping from nearly 3 million barrels per day to just 300,000 in 2019. Today, after significant challenges, production is slowly approaching the 1 million mark again.\n\nSince 2016, for the first time in its history, remittances from emigrants have become a significant source of Venezuelan tax revenues. The exodus of between seven and eight million people, according to United Nations estimates, represents an unprecedented event in recent Latin American history, highlighting the severity of Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse and the erosion of its citizens\u2019 political rights. Despite implementing measures like food rationing based on the last digit of each citizen\u2019s identity card, the Maduro government has refused to acknowledge its responsibility for the crisis or the existence of a Venezuelan diaspora.\n\nThe disastrous performance of the Chavista administration triggered a political shift. In December 2015, the Venezuelan opposition achieved a decisive victory in the parliamentary elections, sending shockwaves through Chavismo. In response, Chavismo moved quickly to consolidate control over all state institutions. This led to the absolute concentration of power in the hands of Maduro and a select group of loyalists, while the government implemented social programs aimed at maintaining Chavista support and building networks of loyalty.\n\nMaduro introduced the Carn\u00e9 de la Patria, a document offering access to a range of digital subsidies, though the contributions are now minimal, along with the CLAP food bags, which are part of the Local Supply and Production Committees. While the population continues to accept these initiatives, surveys consistently show a sharp decline in popularity. However, any assistance remains inadequate given the collapse of the country\u2019s productive activity. In the meantime, Venezuelans are facing a period marked by political uncertainty and looming economic instability.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

            "article_content": "We raise our fair value estimate for narrow-moat Pro Medicus PME by 2% to $46 per share, largely due to a strengthening US dollar and the time value of money. Our constant-currency earnings estimates are broadly unchanged. We expect further contract wins to underpin earnings growth. To this end, the firm announced a contract win with the University of Kentucky for a total committed minimum value of $33 million over nine years. Planning for the rollout is commencing immediately based on Pro Medicus\u2019 established cloud-based implementation and we assume a two-month earnings contribution in fiscal 2025.\n\nPro Medicus remains materially overvalued, with a lot of good news baked in. Shares currently trade over 170 times our forecast fiscal 2026 earnings per share. While some smaller radiology groups are willing to pay a premium for Visage 7, we still anticipate wider uptake to be slow. Visage 7 resonates most with US academic hospitals and large healthcare systems that have a greater interest in advanced visualizations. However, management believes that even some top hospitals don\u2019t require the best technology in the market, even in terms of speed and quality of images. We also expect downward pressure on the average size of future contracts as the more lucrative academic hospitals market inches closer to saturation.\n\nOur midcycle EBIT margin forecast stands. We forecast EBIT margin to increase slightly to 73% by fiscal 2034 from 70% in fiscal 2024. While the firm has great cost control, we think the research and development spending required to stay competitive in the long term will limit margin expansion. There are low barriers to entry in the industry, and competing products such as Philips\u2019 HealthSuite platform are catching up by utilizing or exploring similar technology such as server-side rendering, cloud-native architecture, and artificial intelligence.\n\nBusiness model is sound, but shares screen as expensive\n\nPro Medicus\u2019 strategy revolves around renewing existing contracts and winning new clients for its main product, Visage 7, while increasing its price point. The company won six out of six major public tenders it competed for in fiscal 2021, which often involved on-site pilot tests. While this likely highlights Visage 7\u2019s current superior speed, scalability, and resilience, continued investment in research and development is imperative for the firm to remain at the forefront of innovation and consistently win contracts. Most of the firm\u2019s expenses are allocated to over 40 software engineers with the main R&D center located in Berlin. The company also recently extended its R&D capability in New York in collaboration with NYU Langone Health in 2021. Its R&D efforts mostly revolve around software enhancements, program extensions, and research in artificial intelligence to assist in diagnoses.\n\nMany of Pro Medicus\u2019 competitors already utilize server-side rendering and cloud-native architecture. Legacy systems are also mostly owned by larger competitors such as GE Healthcare, Fujifilm, and Philips that will be incentivized by the high returns in the industry. In Australia, Sectra won a AUD 85 million 13-year deal over Pro Medicus with NSW Health for both its Radiology Information System and Picture Archiving Communications System in 2020.\n\nVisage 7 has found most success with US academic hospitals and in fiscal 2022 was in nine out of the top 20 ranked US hospitals, more than double its nearest competitor. While Pro Medicus has secured a few contracts with midmarket US hospitals such as Allegheny and Wellspan, wider uptake has been slow with Visage 7\u2019s features likely superfluous for their normal operations. However, Pro Medicus is still targeting smaller radiology groups that seek to consolidate IT infrastructure and become more efficient.\n\nCurrently, Visage 7 is limited to radiology departments, but Pro Medicus is aiming to extend the product set to other specialty departments including cardiology and ophthalmology. In addition, when winning contracts, the firm has other product offerings such as Open Archive or Visage RIS that it can cross-sell to clients.\n\nPME bulls say\n\nPro Medicus is well positioned to benefit from industry tailwinds such as cloud adoption, larger datasets, and remote access.\n\nEarnings are extremely defensive due to contracted revenue being largely guaranteed over five to eight years from customers.\n\nThe long-term growth opportunity is significant as most of the US market still uses legacy systems and other geographies are largely untapped.\n\nPME bears say\n\nProduct differentiation is unlikely to be durable, with low barriers to entry and larger competitors already utilizing server-side rendering and cloud-native architecture.\n\nWide adoption outside of academic hospitals is unproved, and superior speed and visualizations are likely superfluous features for the average hospital.\n\nFuture contract wins are likely to be smaller as Pro Medicus already dominates the larger US academic hospital market.\n\nTerms used in this article\n\nStar Rating: Our one- to five-star ratings are guideposts to a broad audience and individuals must consider their own specific investment goals, risk tolerance, and several other factors. A five-star rating means our analysts think the current market price likely represents an excessively pessimistic outlook and that beyond fair risk-adjusted returns are likely over a long timeframe. A one-star rating means our analysts think the market is pricing in an excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential and leaving the investor exposed to capital loss.\n\nFair Value: Morningstar\u2019s Fair Value estimate results from a detailed projection of a company's future cash flows, resulting from our analysts' independent primary research. Price To Fair Value measures the current market price against estimated Fair Value. If a company\u2019s stock trades at $100 and our analysts believe it is worth $200, the price to fair value ratio would be 0.5. A Price to Fair Value over 1 suggests the share is overvalued.\n\nMoat Rating: An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period. Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to sustain excess returns for at least a decade. For wide-moat companies, we have high confidence that excess returns will persist for 10 years and are likely to persist at least 20 years. To learn about finding different sources of moat, read this article by Mark LaMonica."

            "article_content": "Recent UFO Cloud Sightings Over the UK: A Growing Phenomenon\n\nIn recent years, the United Kingdom has become a hotspot for unusual atmospheric phenomena, including sightings of UFO clouds. While UFO sightings themselves are not new, there has been a notable increase in reports of strange cloud formations that appear to be connected to UFO activity. These incidents have fuelled speculation that the skies above the UK might be hiding more than just ordinary weather patterns. From rural areas in Scotland to urban centres in England, observers have documented several UFO-related cloud events, prompting fresh debates about the connection between these clouds and extraterrestrial craft.\n\nWhen people think of UFOs, they often envision saucer-shaped craft zooming through the sky, or strange lights darting across the night. However, there is another intriguing phenomenon that has become linked with UFO sightings\u2014UFO clouds. These mysterious cloud formations, which often appear anomalous or out of place, have sparked numerous theories and debates over the years. Are these clouds simply rare meteorological events, or could they be related to extraterrestrial activity? In this article, we explore the fascinating world of UFO clouds, the possible causes behind them, and how they tie into UFO lore.\n\nWhat Are UFO Clouds?\n\nThe term \"UFO cloud\" refers to a type of cloud formation that appears unusual or particularly striking in appearance, often leading observers to associate them with unidentified flying objects or extraterrestrial phenomena. These clouds are typically characterised by their strange shape, colour, or movement, and they often appear in areas where UFO sightings have been reported. While some of these clouds are nothing more than unusual atmospheric phenomena, others appear to defy typical meteorological explanations, sparking theories of alien involvement.\n\nOne of the most common characteristics of UFO clouds is their circular or disc-like shape. They often appear as smooth, flat clouds with defined edges, resembling the classic depictions of UFOs in popular culture. These formations can be strikingly similar to the saucer-shaped objects that UFO enthusiasts believe extraterrestrials use for travel. As a result, many UFO sightings involve reports of a UFO cloud in the vicinity, further fueling speculation about their connection.\n\nThe 2021 \"Saucer Cloud\" Incident Over London\n\nOne of the most widely reported UFO cloud sightings in recent UK history occurred in London in 2021. Witnesses described seeing a disc-shaped cloud hovering over the skyline, with its smooth, circular edges resembling the classic depiction of a UFO. The cloud was observed in broad daylight, and although it did not move in a manner that suggested it was a flying object, the perfectly symmetrical shape led many onlookers to wonder if it was an optical illusion caused by a UFO. Eyewitnesses also noted that the cloud appeared to glow faintly in the light, further enhancing its surreal and otherworldly presence.\n\nSeveral UFO researchers quickly jumped on the case, suggesting that the cloud could be linked to some form of atmospheric disturbance created by a UFO. Meteorologists, however, suggested that the cloud could have been a rare lenticular cloud, which can form in circular shapes under specific atmospheric conditions, especially near mountain ranges or strong wind currents. Still, the resemblance to the saucer-shaped craft often seen in UFO sightings was too uncanny to ignore, and the event gained significant attention on social media.\n\nUFO Cloud Sightings in Scotland\u2019s Highlands\n\nIn Scotland, particularly in the remote Highlands, there have been increasing reports of mysterious cloud formations that coincide with UFO sightings. In 2020, a group of hikers in the Cairngorms National Park described seeing unusual cloud structures in the sky, which they believed were connected to a UFO. The clouds were described as massive, elongated formations that appeared to \"move\" in strange patterns, with some observers even reporting that the clouds seemed to change shape rapidly, as if they were being manipulated by a force beyond the natural elements.\n\nSome locals in rural parts of Scotland have long been proponents of the idea that the area\u2019s isolation and its connection to ancient folklore might attract UFOs or otherworldly visitors. These recent cloud sightings, coupled with ongoing UFO reports, have only strengthened these theories. The belief that UFOs use the clouds as a form of camouflage or as a by-product of their energy emissions has found fertile ground in these remote communities.\n\nStrange Clouds Over Manchester\n\nIn late 2022, Manchester, a bustling urban centre in the north of England, became the site of another mysterious cloud sighting. Several witnesses reported seeing a dark, swirling cloud that appeared to hover for an unusually long period above the city. The cloud was said to take on an amorphous, disc-like form before dissipating into the sky without any clear explanation.\n\nWhat made this sighting particularly intriguing was the concurrent UFO sighting reported by a resident just hours before. According to the witness, they saw a series of bright lights darting across the sky, followed by the sudden appearance of the swirling cloud. Some speculated that the cloud might have been a side effect of the UFO\u2019s propulsion system, or that the lights and cloud were linked in some way. A few local news outlets picked up the story, with experts offering both mundane meteorological explanations and more speculative theories involving extraterrestrial phenomena.\n\nThe Connection Between UFOs and Clouds in the UK\n\nThe recent spate of UFO cloud sightings over the UK has led some to wonder whether there is a pattern connecting these unusual formations to extraterrestrial activity. The country has seen a notable uptick in UFO reports over the past decade, with several credible witnesses\u2014ranging from military personnel to ordinary citizens\u2014describing sightings of strange lights or unidentified craft in the sky.\n\nSome UFO enthusiasts and researchers argue that the unusual clouds could be camouflage for UFOs, a way for extraterrestrial craft to hide their presence in plain sight. According to this theory, UFOs might create or manipulate cloud formations in such a way as to remain undetected by conventional observation, blending in with the natural weather patterns.\n\nOthers speculate that these clouds may be linked to atmospheric anomalies created by UFO propulsion systems. Some UFOs, especially those described as \"saucer-shaped\", are often associated with electromagnetic or plasma-based propulsion methods. According to proponents of this theory, the interaction between the craft\u2019s energy field and the surrounding atmosphere could lead to the formation of oddly shaped clouds, which could be mistaken for a natural weather phenomenon.\n\nAdditionally, it's possible that the rise in sightings of UFO clouds is simply a result of heightened public awareness and media coverage of UFO phenomena. As UFOs and related sightings become a more widely discussed topic\u2014thanks in part to government disclosures and the release of previously classified reports\u2014more people may be looking at the sky with a more discerning eye, noticing unusual cloud formations that they might have otherwise overlooked.\n\nScientific and Meteorological Explanations\n\nOf course, there are scientific explanations for most of these strange cloud sightings. As mentioned earlier, lenticular clouds and roll clouds are two of the most commonly misidentified formations. Both types of clouds have a characteristic shape that can resemble UFOs or discs, particularly when seen from certain angles or under specific lighting conditions.\n\nMeteorologists also point out that some weather systems\u2014such as cold fronts or warm air surges\u2014can produce clouds that appear to behave in unusual ways, such as hanging low in the sky or shifting shape rapidly. Such phenomena could be responsible for some of the recent reports in the UK, especially those involving swirling, elongated clouds.\n\nTypes of UFO Clouds\n\nThough no official meteorological classification exists for UFO clouds, several specific types of cloud formations have become associated with UFO phenomena. These clouds share certain characteristics, which make them seem out of place or highly unusual. Here are some of the most common types:\n\n1. Lenticular Clouds\n\nLenticular clouds are large, lens-shaped clouds that often form over mountains or other elevated terrain. These clouds are typically stationary and can take on a disc-like appearance, which has led many to speculate that they are associated with UFOs. Lenticular clouds are formed when air flows over a mountain range, creating a standing wave of air. As the air moves upward and cools, it condenses into a cloud, and its shape can appear very similar to a saucer or disc.\n\nLenticular clouds are commonly mistaken for UFOs because of their smooth, distinct shape, and they often appear to hover in the sky. While these clouds are completely natural and can be explained by atmospheric science, their resemblance to UFOs has contributed to numerous sightings and theories about extraterrestrial activity.\n\n2. Roll Clouds\n\nA roll cloud is a type of low, horizontal cloud that can appear to \"roll\" across the sky, giving it a cylindrical appearance. These clouds are usually associated with storm fronts and can stretch for hundreds of miles. Although roll clouds are a well-known meteorological phenomenon, their long, uniform shape and movement can create an eerie or otherworldly effect. In some cases, roll clouds have been reported in conjunction with UFO sightings, and their unusual, rolling motion has led to speculation that they may be linked to alien technology or atmospheric anomalies caused by UFOs.\n\n3. Mammatus Clouds\n\nMammatus clouds are puffy, balloon-like formations that typically appear beneath the base of a thunderstorm cloud. They often create a striking and somewhat ominous visual effect, with their bulbous, sagging appearance giving them a surreal, otherworldly quality. While mammatus clouds are associated with intense thunderstorms, their strange shape and eerie nature have caused some to connect them with UFOs or extraterrestrial activity. The clouds' unusual appearance, particularly when seen in isolation or during an otherwise calm period, can evoke images of hovering ships or alien craft, leading to UFO-related speculation.\n\n4. Noctilucent Clouds\n\nNoctilucent clouds are high-altitude clouds that are most visible during the summer months, especially at latitudes between 50 and 70 degrees north and south. These clouds form in the mesosphere, far higher than typical clouds, and they glow with an eerie, blue or silver light after sunset. While the phenomenon can be explained by the reflection of sunlight on ice crystals in the clouds, the unusual, glowing nature of noctilucent clouds has led to various UFO-related theories. Their ethereal glow and unusual location in the atmosphere have given rise to questions about whether they might be linked to extraterrestrial activity or even serve as a cover for UFOs.\n\nUFO Clouds and the UFO Phenomenon\n\nThe connection between UFO clouds and UFO sightings is a subject of intense fascination for both UFO enthusiasts and meteorologists. Some individuals claim that certain UFO clouds are associated with UFO activity, suggesting that the clouds might be a type of camouflage or atmospheric distortion created by alien spacecraft. Others believe that UFOs themselves may be responsible for the formation of these clouds, either as a result of the energy they emit or the atmospheric disturbances they cause.\n\nOne of the most notable cases linking UFOs to clouds occurred in 1957, when several people reported seeing a UFO hovering above a strange cloud formation over the Pacific Northwest in the United States. The object was described as disc-shaped, and the cloud that formed underneath it appeared to be perfectly round, prompting some to believe that the cloud was the result of the UFO\u2019s activity. Since then, similar reports of UFO sightings coinciding with unusual cloud formations have been documented, further cementing the idea that there may be a connection.\n\nScientific Explanations vs. Extraterrestrial Theories\n\nWhile UFO clouds are often seen as evidence of alien involvement in atmospheric phenomena, there are more grounded scientific explanations for these unusual cloud formations. Meteorologists argue that many of the clouds associated with UFO sightings are simply natural occurrences. Lenticular clouds, roll clouds, and mammatus clouds are all well-documented and have clear meteorological explanations that do not require the involvement of extraterrestrial beings.\n\nHowever, the mystique of UFOs and the possibility of alien life continues to captivate the human imagination. For many, the idea that UFOs might be responsible for certain cloud formations provides a compelling narrative that fits within the broader framework of UFO lore. The persistent sightings of these clouds, combined with the belief in extraterrestrial visitation, means that UFO clouds will likely continue to fuel theories and debates for years to come.\n\nConclusion: A Continued Mystery\n\nThe recent sightings of UFO clouds in the UK serve to deepen the mystery surrounding both unidentified flying objects and the enigmatic nature of cloud formations. While scientific explanations are readily available, the persistent association of these unusual clouds with UFO sightings continues to fuel the debate about extraterrestrial involvement.\n\nAs UFO sightings remain a popular subject of fascination for many, it seems likely that these strange, disc-shaped clouds and anomalous weather phenomena will continue to spark curiosity. Whether they are merely natural atmospheric events or signs of something more profound remains a question that has yet to be definitively answered. For now, the skies above the UK\u2014and the mysterious clouds within them\u2014remain a captivating enigma."

            "article_content": "MAJMA\u2019 Lagos Graduates New Set Of Students\n\nThe Secretary General, Association of Arab Universities, and Egypt former Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Professor Amr Ezzat Salama, has said that societal progress should not solely be measured by advancements in natural sciences, because unregulated growth of applied sciences without a parallel advancement in humanities and social sciences may have adverse consequences for humanity.\n\nSpeaking at the graduation ceremony of the 2023 and 2024 classes from the MAJMA Research and Training Centre, Lagos in Arabic and Shari\u2019ah studies, Salama stated that human history has repeatedly demonstrated the risks of unbalanced scientific development without a comprehensive understanding of human and social phenomena.\n\nHe, therefore, underscored the importance of studying Islamic, social, and human sciences, as they shape human awareness.\n\nSalama urged the graduates to remain steadfast in adhering to the values derived from the Holy Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah, adopting a balanced approach in faith, conduct, and service to their communities while spreading noble values.\n\n\u201cThe Arabic language, chosen by Allah as the medium for His final revelation, is the language of the Holy Qur\u2019an, the Sunnah, prayer, pilgrimage, supplication, and the rich Islamic civilization that has flourished across centuries. For every Muslim, understanding Islam in its true essence cannot rely solely on translated works but must come directly from the original texts written in Arabic.\n\n\u201cDuring the medieval era, the Islamic kingdoms that thrived in East and West Africa played a significant role in rooting the Arabic language among local populations and transferring Islamic civilization and thought.\u201d\n\nCongratulating the graduates, Salama stated that the academic degrees are the fruit of hard work and dedication which will serve as keys to their next endeavours.\n\n\u201cI also encourage you to equip yourselves with Islamic knowledge while keeping pace with advancements in science and technology, particularly in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This revolution has introduced a new reality, demanding advanced skills in fields like artificial intelligence, automation, and big data.\n\n\u201cThe Fourth Industrial Revolution and AI technologies have significantly transformed the nature of jobs, creating an urgent need to balance applied sciences and humanities. This ensures that technological progress becomes a tool for building societies, not a threat to them.\n\n\u201cI must stress the importance of studying Islamic, social, and human sciences, as they shape human awareness. Societal progress is not solely contingent on advancements in natural sciences.\n\n\u201cThe unregulated growth of applied sciences without a parallel advancement in humanities and social sciences may have adverse consequences for humanity. Human history has repeatedly demonstrated the risks of unbalanced scientific development without a comprehensive understanding of human and social phenomena.\u201d\n\nSalama argued that the youths are the primary drivers of development and its ultimate beneficiaries. \u201cTherefore, we must continue investing in young people through education, training, and skill development to ensure they remain innovative and distinguished in this era of rapid transformation.\n\n\u201cThe mission of the Association of Arab Universities is to solidify the true image of Islam and its noble message to humanity. The association supports academic and scientific endeavours aimed at spreading the teachings of Islam based on its primary sources, the Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah.\n\n\u201cNotably, the Association\u2019s Sharia Colleges Network plays a leading role in publishing research and studies in Islamic sciences across Arab universities.\n\n\u201cIn our discussions with leaders in Nigeria, the Association seeks to strengthen collaboration with Nigerian academic institutions, particularly in Arabic language education, Islamic studies, and historical research. The Association has also organised training programmess for students of the Research and Training Complex at Arab universities, reaffirming its commitment to supporting higher education and serving the issues of the Islamic nation.\u201d\n\nIn his presentation on the goals and aspirations of the institute, President, MAJMA Research and Training Centre, Professor Saheed Ahmed Rufai, highlighted the centre\u2019s area of focus to principally be around training in Islamic Revealed Studies (English, Arabic), Arabic Studies (Arabic, English), Educational Studies (English, Arabic), General Studies (English) and other possible areas of societal need.\n\nHe also said that the centre would be engaging in research and publications, counseling as well as speaking with the target audience being residents of Nigeria who want to learn Arabic and/or further their Islamic education though it would not be blind to interested persons from outside Nigeria if they are willing and able to sponsor the above persons.\n\nRufai said that the channel of engagement for its training, publications and public speaking will be through website, social media and conventional media along with in-person classes, online instruction, distance learning and directed self-study.\n\nAs the centre looks into the future including expanding its reach, Rufai said that it needs support to have its own building, computers, office furniture, office equipment, bus, library and broadband internet.\n\nOne of the special guests at the event, Pro-chancellor/ Chairman, Governing Council of Summit University, Offa, Kwara State, Alhaji Rafiu Adisa Ebiti, also tasked Muslims to learn and deeply understand Arabic language as a pathway to understanding the teachings of Qur\u2019an and the voice of Allah.\n\nAt the event, diploma, advanced diploma and post graduate diploma certificates in Arabic and Shari\u2019ah were presented to graduates trained through MAJMA Training and Research Centre, Lagos.\n\n"

This university played an important role in the movement,\" the press secretary said.\n\nNoting that this image should be conveyed to the world as the future of the students is related to the image, he said, \"We have to work to preserve the history of the movement of this university.\"\n\nHe said the names of the halls that still remain in the name of the dictator need to be changed to the martyrs' names.\n\nThe press secretary said the aspirations of people are being fulfilled through reform commissions to build a new Bangladesh.\n\nThe reports of commissions are the outcomes of the July Uprising, he said, urging all students to read these reports and join debate on those on the campus.\n\nChaired by Chairman of IU Communication and Multimedia Journalism Department Professor Dr Rashiduzzaman, the seminar was addressed, among others, by IU Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Nakib Muhammad Nasrullah, Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Yeaqub Ali, treasurer Professor Dr Jahangir Alam and treasurer of Jashore University of Science and Technology Professor Dr Hossain Al Mamun.\n\nSM Rashidul Islam, special correspondent of Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), also spoke at the seminar as a discussant.\n\nSource: BSS"
