Eerie \u2018UFO cloud\u2019 shocks Brits as rare phenomenon lurks over UK town for 10 minutes before disappearing\n\nA MYSTERIOUS cloud, shaped just like an alien spaceship, has been spotted hovering over the UK.\n\nThe strange sighting has been likened by onlookers to something out of sci-fi horror movie Nope, in which humans are sucked up and eaten by an otherworldly monster.\n\n2 This cloud is often what reports of UFOs turn out to be Credit: SWNS\n\nBut the cloud isn't anything sinister.\n\nIt's actually a rare phenomenon known as a lenticular cloud.\n\nCivil servant Dave Pickett, 38, and his son Blake, 7, snapped the moment before it quickly disappeared as it flew above Greenfield, near Oldham in Greater Manchester on Friday.\n\n\"We agreed it looked like a spaceship,\" he said.\n\n\"It wasn't the same ten minutes later, when the sky lost its colour as the sun was rising.\n\n\"I got lucky and had my phone to hand.\"\n\nHe added: \"I\u2019d never seen anything like it.\n\n\u201cA friend commented that it was a lenticular cloud, I had never heard of it.\n\n\"It reminded me of Nope.

I didn't sleep last night. When I would get up and look out my window, at 2am, 4am, they were still hovering,' Julie Shavalier, a Morris County resident, said.\n\nOthers have raised concerns that the objects are not drones, but UFOs.\n\nThe FBI has launched an investigation into mysterious, 'car-sized' drones seen flying over over New Jersey at night in the last several weeks\n\nSightings have been reported over Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster\n\nThe sightings have gained attention on social media, prompting speculation about where the drones came from and what they are doing.\n\n'False flag alien invasion. That\u2019s what they want, to induce fear,' one person posted on X.\n\nOthers suggested the drones are being used to spy on President-elect Donald Trump, who has been known to vacation at his Bedminster golf club and typically flies into Morristown Airport.\n\nTrump was the target of a failed Iranian assassination attempt in November.\n\nFarhad Shakeri, 51, was revealed to have admitted to orchestrating the terrifying scheme which was thwarted by the FBI and involved three alleged hitmen who were hired by the feared Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to carry out a hit on the president-elect.\n\nAnd earlier last month, Chinese spies were said to have hacked the smartphones of Trumps' lawyer and campaign staff.\n\nThe attacks have raised concerns about America's adversaries spying on the president-elect.\n\nEyewitnesses have reported spotting the unexplained drones over the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster and the Picatinny Arsenal Military Base in Rockaway, among other locations\n\nBut it is not clear whether he has been at the golf course recently or who is behind the drones.\n\nX users also speculatively attributed the drones to Amazon's new Prime Air delivery service or, worryingly, to surveillance from a foreign power.\n\nMorris County Sheriff, James Gannon, told NBC News: 'There is no advisable immediate danger to the public at this time.'\n\nThe drone sightings first began in mid-November and have continued almost every night since, residents have reported.\n\nBut strangely, they appeared to 'take the night off' on Thanksgiving, Mike Walsh, a Morris County resident, told NBC New York.\n\nThe flying objects are larger than drones used by hobbyists, raising questions about their proximity to those specific locations\n\n\u201cCar-sized drones\u201d have reportedly just been spotted over President Trump\u2019s private residence in Bedminster, NJ \ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa5: @Civil_Disco pic.twitter.com/llL6uGoky2 \u2014 Matt Wallace (@MattWallace888) December 3, 2024\n\nOn November 22, the FAA banned drone flights over the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster until December 6, and the Picatinny Arsenal Military Base in Rockaway until December 26.\n\n'We look into all reports of unauthorized drone operations and investigate when appropriate,' the FAA said in a statement.\n\nThe agency also noted that drone operators who endanger aircraft of pedestrians could be fined up to $75,000 and lose their drone operators' pilot certificates.\n\nDays later, the FBI confirmed they were investigating the drone activity.\n\nThe digital news site NJ.com spoke with Eric Kowal, a spokesman for Picatinny Arsenal, who said it is illegal to fly drones over the base without prior authorization. But he does not believe the drones pose an immediate threat.\n\n'From our standpoint we're not alarming our residents and employees,' he said.\n\n'The FBI are the experts on the threat. We don't believe there to be a threat at this juncture.'\n\nNew Jersians are 'unnerved' by the incidents, telling reporters that they have seen drones hovering near their homes for hours at a time, sometimes in groups.\n\nWalsh stated that he has seen up to eight drones at once.\n\nChristian Kalweit, a small business owner from Mendham, said one of the drones he was was as big as a Cessna airplane.\n\n'All somebody needs to do is see the size... you're not buying that off of Amazon or some hobby store,' he told NJ.com.\n\nHe believes that the size is indicative of a military-grade aircraft.\n\nFor now, New Jersey residents can only guess who or what is behind the strange activity, as officials have not released any new information to explain their presence."

Seymour. He was just 5 years old at the time and was at Ford Theatre the night Lincoln was assassinated. In February 1956, at age 95, Samuel appeared on the TV game show I've Got a Secret and told his story (he would die a few months later).\n\nAnd fun fact: Samuel also had two very famous people try to guess his secret. Audrey Meadows, who starred in the classic sitcom The Honeymooners and the ICONIC Lucille Ball.\n\n2.Contrary to popular belief, Cleopatra was NOT a box office bomb; in fact, it was the highest-grossing film of 1963. The issue was that the film was so expensive to make, it really didn't turn a profit.\n\nSilver Screen Collection / Getty Images\n\nAt the time, the movie cost $42 million to make (which, when adjusted for inflation, is around $433,264,313 million in today's money). There were several reasons the cost got out of control, including the elaborate costumes and sets, production delays, and Elizabeth Taylor's health, which forced the already-built sets to be moved from cold rainy London to sunny Rome.\n\n20thcentfox / \u00a920thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nCleopatra was so costly that it almost bankrupted 20th Century Fox \u2014 which was forced to sell 300 acres of its backlot to stay afloat. That area is now modern-day Century City.\n\nGeorge Rose / Getty Images\n\n3.The Wizard of Oz was not a box office hit when it was released in 1939. Like Cleopatra, it was a very expensive movie to make and had a hard time recouping its money at the box office. It cost close to $3 million dollars to make (including promotional costs), and as the LA Times pointed out, it needed to make that back when the average movie theater ticket cost 25 cents for adults and 15 cents for kids.\n\nWarner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nThe film would eventually make a profit when it was re-released 10 years later, in 1949.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection\n\nHowever, the reason the film has become such an iconic piece of pop culture is that starting in 1956, it began having yearly TV showings that helped introduce it to new generations of kids over the decades (especially since this was in the pre-home video time).\n\nThe picture above is of Judy Garland's daughters, Liza Minnelli and Lorna Luft, watching the very first airing of The Wizard of Oz on TV in 1956.

There were also several books, like The Roswell Incident, that were published about it that further delved into it being a huge government cover-up.\n\nDavid Zaitz / Getty Images\n\nMost everything we think about when we think of the \"Roswell crash,\" like the alien bodies, a nurse seeing them (who later died in suspicious circumstances), the military base being on high alert and filled with strange debris, came from an episode of Unsolved Mysteries. Those things mentioned in the episode came from Glenn Dennis, who was a mortician in Roswell in 1947 and claimed to have been contacted by the Air Force for child-sized hermetically sealed caskets and asked how to preserve bodies exposed to the elements, and that he was also friends with the nurse who saw the alien bodies first-hand.\n\nIt should be noted that Dennis never talked about all of these things until either 1989 or 1990 (over 40 years after the supposed crash). Also, his story changed a lot over the years with researchers finding many inconsistencies (like the name of the nurse) and inaccuracies in it. NBC\n\n5.The Phoenix Lights is thought to be the most witnessed UFO sighting ever. Thousands of people in Arizona and Nevada reported seeing the two separate incidents that make up the Phoenix Lights.\n\nazfamily powered by 3TV & CBS5AZ / Via youtube.com\n\nIt happened on March 13, 1997, at around 8 p.m.; people began reporting seeing a very large V-shaped object (with three lights on the bottom of each side and one in the front) flying very slowly and silently over the towns of Prescott and Dewey, Arizona. A couple of hours later, at around 10 p.m., a series of red and orange lights appeared to hover above Phoenix.\n\nCris180 / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nAs I said above, this was witnessed by thousands of people, including Kurt Russell \u2014 who was actually an unnamed pilot who reported what he was seeing to the airport. Russell happened to be flying his plane with his son, Oliver, when they came across the lights. He went on to say that he and Oliver never spoke about it, and he never really thought about it until a few years later when his wife, Goldie Hawn, was watching a TV show that was doing a piece on the Phoenix Lights and that's when it all came back to him.\n\nYou can watch Kurt talk about it here. BBC / Via youtube.com\n\nEventually, the US Air Force came forward to say that they were responsible for the incident, admitting that lights were leftover high-intensity flares dropped during a training exercise. Although, lots of people who witnessed the Phoenix Lights are skeptical of that explanation to this day.\n\nU.s. Navy / Getty Images\n\n6.In 1960, Psycho changed how people watched movies in theaters \u2014 and it's how we watch them today. Before 1960, it was common for people to buy a ticket and drop into a theater at any point during a movie. Movies played on loops repeatedly, so if you only caught the last half-hour of a movie, you would just stay in your seat and wait for it to play again so you could watch what you missed. Directors and studios hated that, but it's how people were used to going to the movies. However, that posed a problem for Psycho.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection / Courtesy\n\nOne of the big twists in Psycho is that Janet Leigh's character, Marion Crane, is murdered in the shower halfway through the film. Janet was the movie's most famous star, so having her killed would shock and confuse the audience and make them not know what to expect next. Alfred Hitchcock had gone to great lengths to keep the plot a complete secret, so he wanted people not to have the film spoiled by coming in after that shower scene.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection / Everett Collection / Everett Collection\n\nJerry Pickman, who was the then-vice president of advertising and publicity at Paramount, came up with an ingenious way to both market the film and ensure people watched the movie from the beginning. He created an ad campaign (like the poster seen below) that featured Hitchcock telling people that they not only had to watch Psycho from the beginning but also that theaters would refuse to let anyone in after the movie had started.\n\nThe campaign worked. People arrived to the theaters on time and watched the movie from start to finish. After that, theaters slowly started setting start times for movies, as audiences were now conditioned after Psycho to get there before the movie started. Paramount/ Courtesy Everett Collection\n\n7.Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone in The Godfather is considered legendary and has gone down in cinematic history as such. But he almost didn't get the part of Vito because at the time, he was considered a temperamental, washed-up actor, whom the studio refused to hire. And for his part, Brando initially wasn't interested and didn't really want to work.\n\nParamount / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nIn fact, it was truly a series of events that got Brando cast in the role. The film's director, Francis Ford Coppola, was dead set on casting either Brando or Laurence Olivier as Vito. When he was told no to casting Brando by Paramount\u2019s then-president, Stanley Jaffe, Coppola faked a stress-induced epilepsy in Jaffe's office. After that stunt, Jaffe reconsidered and told him he would consider Brando for the role on three conditions \u2014 with one of them being that he would need to screen-test for it.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection\n\nMeanwhile, Mario Puzo, who wrote The Godfather novel, read a story that comedian\u2013sitcom star\u2013producer Danny Thomas was interested in buying a majority share in Paramount with the sole purpose of casting himself as Vito. That caused an alarmed Puzo to write a letter to Brando \u2014 whom he had envisioned in the role \u2014 and plead with him to consider the role of Vito. Brando's personal secretary, Alice Marchak, knew that he needed to work because he was deeply in debt, so she bought a subscription to the Hollywood Reporter to keep tabs on potential roles for him. However, he caught her reading it one day and got mad that she would bring \"movie magazines into [his] house.\" So she left his house and let him cool off for a few days, during which time she read that Paramount was looking to cast the role of Vito in The Godfather. When she came back to Brando's house, she found Puzo's letter in the mail.\n\nPerson in formal tuxedo holds an award statue, standing in front of a large statue at an event\n\nPerson smiling, wearing a blue suit with a tie and white shirt, in front of a plain background\n\nBettmann / Bettmann Archive, Abc Photo Archives / Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPuzo and Brando would eventually talk over the phone, and by then, Marchak had read the book and knew the role was right for him. She also slowly played to Brando's ego by commenting to him about all his fellow actors who were being considered for the role \u2014 causing him to want the part even more.\n\nEventually, he agreed to it, but Coppola knew he would need to screen-test him in order to cast him (something that would be an insult to an actor of Brando's stature). So he devised a plan in which he didn't tell Brando it was a screen test, but instead told him that he wanted to come over to his house to try some things for the camera, experiment a bit, and try some improvisation. And that worked. When Coppola finally did the not-a-screen-test-at-all at Brando's house, he saw the 47-year-old actor transform into Vito in front of his eyes as he smeared black shoe polish on his blonde hair to give it a darker and greased-back look, gave himself a shoe polish mustache, and put wads of tissue in his cheeks to give himself an appearance of a bulldog. The rest, of course, is movie history.\n\n/ Everett Collection / Everett Collection\n\n8.The iconic boulder-rolling scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark is an homage to a very similar thing that happened in the 1954 Scrooge McDuck comic \"The Seven Cities of Cibola.\" In the comic, Scrooge, Huey, Dewey, and Louie travel to a lost city, where they find an emerald idol. However, noticing it is booby-trapped, they decide not to take it. What they don't realize is that they have been followed by the Beagle Boys, who decide to steal the idol, which sets off a giant boulder that chases after them.\n\nCbs Photo Archive / CBS via Getty Images\n\nGeorge Lucas \u2014 who came up with Indiana Jones \u2014 was a big fan of the Scrooge McDuck comics (which were created by Carl Barks) growing up and told Edward Summer, a writer who put together a book of Barks' Scrooge comics, that the boulder scene in Raiders was a \"conscious homage\" to \"The Seven Cities of Cibola.\"\n\nFantagraphics / Via amazon.com Walt Disney\n\nIn a sort of full-circle moment, the Raiders logo would go on to inspire the DuckTales one (which of course is a classic cartoon series about Scrooge McDuck's adventures):\n\n9.The classic scene in The Seven Year Itch, where Marilyn Monroe's dress is lifted up by the air from a subway grate, had to be reshot in California at 20th Century Fox's studios.\n\n20th Century Fox Film Corp. All rights reserved. Courtesy: Everett Collection.\n\nThe scene was originally filmed on location in New York City, but there were over 2,000 spectators on the street watching the scene being filmed, and they would yell every time her skirt went up. The noise coming from the crowd made it impossible for director Billy Wilder to use any takes from it.\n\nBettmann / Bettmann Archive / Getty Images\n\nWhile the iconic image of Marilyn's dress billowing up is one of the first things we think about when we think of her, it's actually not shown like that in the movie. In the film, you really don't see anything more than her knees as the dress flows up. However, the full body shot images were used in posters and promotional material for the movie.\n\nTM & Copyright \u00a920th Century Fox Film Corp. / courtesy Everett Collection\n\n10.Dolly Parton secretly produced one of the most iconic and influential shows of all time: Buffy the Vampire Slayer!!!\n\nGetty Images/ Online USA\n\nThe show was produced by Sandollar Entertainment, a production company that Dolly cofounded with her friend and business partner Sandy Gallin (on the right), in 1986.\n\nRon Galella, Ltd. / Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images\n\nIn fact, Sandollar had produced the original movie it was based on, so they owned the rights to it. Gail Berman, who was the then-president and CEO of Sandollar Television, always thought it would be a great TV series. Since Joss Whedon wrote the script to the film, Sandollar was contractually obligated to offer him the opportunity to helm the series. According to Berman, she and Whedon were on the same page about Buffy, with eventually Dolly and Sandy (as heads of the production company) getting involved to help make the series happen.\n\n20thcentfox / \u00a920thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nBerman went on to be an executive producer on Buffy, as well as its spinoff Angel, and left Sandollar shortly thereafter to focus on the shows. After leaving, Berman had lunch with Dolly, where she complained that men at the company had not given her her fair share of the Buffy royalties. Dolly then handed her a check to cover what she was owed.\n\nAraya Doheny / WireImage / Getty Images\n\n11.\"Believe\" is not only one of the most iconic songs of the '90s, but also one that would change music forever. However, Cher wasn't interested in doing a dance song. Still, Rob Dickins, who was the then-president of her label, Warner Music U.K., felt that since her last album (which was rock ballads) had been a disappointment, she should focus on her gay audience and told her to do a dance album. Dickins then reached out to songwriter Brian Higgins to submit songs for a Cher dance album, and \"Believe\" was among one of the songs he sent in.\n\nAfter several rewrites, Cher recorded the song. However, she was unaware that the producers, Mark Taylor and Brian Rawling, had created a version with the signature Auto-Tune effect in it. Afraid that Cher would HATE the Auto-Tune sound, they only shared it with her after having a few beers. Cher loved it and told them to keep it in. Dickins, however, disliked the Auto-Tune sound and told them to take it out. When Cher found out that they were going to take the Auto-Tune effect out, she said, \"You can change that part of it, over my dead body! Don't let anyone touch this track, or I'm going to rip your throat out.\"\n\nJmenternational / Getty Images\n\n12.Tim Burton was supposed to direct a third Batman movie that was reportedly called Batman Continues. The movie would have featured Michael Keaton as Batman, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, and Billy Dee Williams as Two Face.\n\nWarner Bros / \u00a9Warner Bros/courtesy Everett Collection / Everett Collection\n\nEven though Batman Returns was well received by critics and a hit at the box office, Burton was asked to step down by Warner Bros. from making a third Batman movie after parents complained about Batman Returns being too dark and him refusing to make the next film lighter.\n\nWarner Bros / \u00c2\u00a9Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nWarner Bros. also passed on making a Catwoman spinoff film that would've had Pfeiffer reprising the role. The film also would have been directed by Burton and written by the same writer who wrote Batman Returns.\n\nWarner Bros. wanted to keep the Batman franchise family friendly, and the spinoff would have been as dark Batman Returns. Warner Bros / \u00c2\u00a9Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nJoel Schumacher was brought on by Warner Bros. to helm the Batman franchise. And while it was reported that Michael Keaton didn't want to return to the role because Tim Burton was no longer involved, that wasn't exactly the case. In an interview with In the Envelope: The Actor's Podcast in 2022, Keaton said that he did talk to Schumacher about a third film, but that the two clashed over the direction of the character. Schumacher wanted a more comics-style story, while Keaton wanted to continue to tell the Batman story he created with Burton.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWarner Bros / \u00a9Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection, Warner Bros / \u00a9Warner Bros/courtesy Everett Collection / Everett Collection\n\nWith Keaton gone, Schumacher recast Val Kilmer in the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, as well as Chris O'Donnell in the role of Dick Grayson/Robin. Originally, Marlon Wayans had signed on to play Robin in what would've been Burton's third Batman film.\n\nRon Galella, Ltd. / Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images, Warner Bros / \u00a9Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nHowever, Wayans gets residuals for Batman Forever, even though he does NOT appear in the movie. Per a clause in his contract, he was guaranteed to be paid his salary plus residuals, even if he was recast.\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer / Getty Images\n\n13.From 1977 until her death in 1994, Jackie Kennedy Onassis was a very successful and well-respected book editor at Doubleday. In 1983, executives at Doubleday came up with the idea of having Michael Jackson write his autobiography, and they asked Jackie to help get him to agree to sign and spearhead it. A mega-famous pop star's memoir would not be the type of book Jackie would ever want to be involved with, but she understood that Doubleday having a huge commercial book would help get her passion projects published. By all accounts, she would go on to regret ever agreeing to get involved.\n\nJackie Kennedy Onassis and older man smiling at an event, man in a formal suit with bowtie\n\nMichael Jackson poses with a snake wrapped around his shoulders, wearing a white shirt\n\nSonia Moskowitz / Getty Images, Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter an initial meeting with Michael at the Jackson family home in Encino, California, Jackie was able to secure the book deal. Michael got a $300K advance, total control over the book, and a foreward written by Jackie (which was something she initially refused to do but went on to agree to). According to Shaye Areheart, who was Jackie's editorial assistant at the time, dealing with Michael was \"a huge nightmare,\" and he seemed uninterested in actually working on the book, which caused it to be delayed.\n\nSonia Moskowitz / Getty Images\n\nMichael also began calling Jackie at her home in Martha's Vineyard to have long phone conversations with her to complain about the difficulties of being famous. Jackie, who was notoriously private, refused to engage with him on that topic. She went on to tell her friend Edward Kasinec that \"Michael Jackson is driving me mad with his phone calls.\" Eventually, Michael submitted his first manuscript, which he worked on with his first ghostwriter. The manuscript was much shorter than they anticipated and featured nothing revealing about himself other than \"fluff.\" Jackie rejected the manuscript and called Michael and told him he needed to open up and be sincere because if it was just a book about how great and successful he was, then \"we'd all be made fools of.\" Michael agreed and got a new ghostwriter.\n\nBettmann / Bettmann Archive / Getty Images\n\nUnhappy with his second manuscript, he began editing parts of it with Jackie's assistant, Shaye, who flew around the world to finish it. Eventually, they were able to finish the second manuscript and get it ready to be published. But Michael then decided he didn't want to publish the book. However, they were able to convince him to do so, and in 1988, his autobiography Moonwalk was published and went on to be No. 1 on the New York Times Best Sellers list and sell out all 500,000 copies printed. Even though it was hugely successful, Michael, who had full control, refused to allow Doubleday to print more copies or a paperback version.\n\nUltimately, it was seen as a huge success for Jackie, too. However, while working on the autobiography, she left a message on J. C. Suar\u00e8s' (the book's designer) answering machine, asking herself why the hell she had ever got involved with the book.

The film was shot in Toronto and had long hours. At the end of the shooting days, Rosie noticed that her infant son, Parker, was more attached to their housekeeper. This made her realize she needed a New York\u2013based job with shorter hours in order to spend more time with him.\n\nParamount / \u00a9Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nSo, Rosie came up with the idea of doing a daytime talk show as the solution. As Vulture puts it, it was a \"then-radical daytime-television experiment\" to do a talk show that was centered on interviewing celebrities and engaging with the live studio audience. But it worked, and the show would go on to change television\n\nFrank Micelotta Archive / Getty Images\n\n15.Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis paid for two Forrest Gump scenes (one was the scene where Forrest runs across the US) to be filmed out of their own pockets. According to Hanks, Paramount refused to increase the film's $55 million budget, and just the running scene alone would be very expensive to shoot.\n\nParamount / \u00a9Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nHanks and Zemeckis agreed to pay for the scenes in return for a larger percentage of the film's box office gross. He said that they both put in a lot of money, but it paid off! Reportedly, Hanks earned $65 million dollars from his percentage of the box office gross.\n\n16.Steve Jobs wanted to call the iMac MacMan. In fact, according to Ken Segall, who was the creative director at Apple\u2019s ad agency, TBWAChiatDay, and came up with the name iMac, Jobs really liked the name MacMan and was \"fixated\" on it. Jobs did approach the agency just to see if they had any better suggestions, saying, \"I have a name that I really like, we\u2019re going to go with it, but if you guys can do better we need you to do better within the next two weeks.\"\n\nUniversalimagesgroup / Getty Images\n\nSegall said that a week later, they met with Jobs and presented him with five names, saving iMac for last because he thought \"it was the killer name.\" However, Jobs hated the name iMac, too.\n\nMedianews Group / MediaNews Group via Getty Images\n\nA week later, Segall presented Jobs with three more names and also brought up that he still liked iMac as a name. Jobs hated the three new names, but said about iMac, \"I don\u2019t hate it this week, but I don\u2019t like it either, so now you\u2019ve got two days.\" Segall said that the next day, a friend at Apple called him to tell him Jobs had used iMac on one of the models and that it was getting good reactions. The rest was history.\n\nPatrick Durand / Sygma via Getty Images\n\n17.Somewhere between 2013 and 2015, you probably came across this popular \"You had one job!\" meme about Phil Tippett, the \"dinosaur supervisor\" credited in the end credits of Jurassic Park.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nWell, he actually was the \"dinosaur supervisor.\" Tippett was an Oscar-winning special effects producer who was brought on to work on Jurassic Park because he specialized in stop-motion animation. Originally, Steven Spielberg had thought all the up-close shots of the dinosaurs would be done by puppets and animatronics (which they did use), and all the full shots and running sequences would be done using models and stop-motion animation.\n\nHot Coco / Universal / Via youtube.com\n\nHowever, the team over at Industrial Light & Magic told Spielberg that CGI technology had gotten a lot better and they could create dinosaurs that could fool the eye. Once Spielberg saw the CGI dinosaurs, he knew that was the way to go.\n\nHot Coco / Universal / Via youtube.com\n\nWhen Spielberg told Tippett that he had decided to go with CGI, Tippett replied, \"I\u2019ve just become extinct!\" (a line that Steven would actually end up using in the movie). However, it was the exact opposite. Spielberg knew Tippett had a special skill set: He knew how animals behaved and moved. So instead of letting him go, Spielberg made Tippett the \"dinosaur supervisor,\" a role that had him overseeing the animation at ILM, to make sure the dinosaurs looked as real, and moved as realistically, as possible.\n\nUniversal Pictures / Via youtube.com\n\n18.Prior to its release in 1997, many critics and Hollywood insiders predicted that Titanic would be a box office bomb. And there were several reasons why it was predicted to be a failure. First off, at the time it was the most expensive movie ever made and was getting compared to the costly Waterworld \u2014 which had been released a couple of years before and had not managed to be a huge success because it, like Titanic, was the then\u2013most expensive movie ever made.\n\nEven though Waterworld grossed over $200 million at the box office, it was deemed a failure/moderate success 'cause it barely made a profit (again like Cleopatra). 20thcentfox / \u00a9 20thCentFox / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nSecond, aside from the cost of filming, Titanic also took a long time to film. Going way over schedule also delayed the release of the movie \u2014 as it was originally meant to be released during the summer (the blockbuster movie season). Moving its release date to December set off red flags.\n\n20thcentfox / \u00a9 20thCentFox / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nAnd last, many on-set stories about everything from the difficulty of working with Cameron to the PCP poisoning of the crew members had been reported throughout the film's production, which only added to the \"doomed film\" narrative.\n\n20thcentfox / \u00a9 20thCentFox / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\n19.And lastly: It wasn't just Netflix; there were various reasons why Blockbuster ended up going out of business. One reason was the popularity of DVDs. Until the introduction of DVDs, studios relied on the movie rental market as their primary way of making money from the home entertainment market \u2014 with Blockbuster accounting for nearly 50% of that revenue for them. To make it lucrative for both sides, the studios would give an exclusive window to video rental chains for new movie releases before they would put them on sale to the general public.\n\nDavid Friedman / Getty Images\n\nSo, if you wanted to watch a new movie at home, you more than likely would only be able to rent it. However, this changed when DVDs were released. In 1998, Warren Lieberfarb, then-head of Warner Bros.'s home video division and an early proponent of DVD technology, approached then-Blockbuster CEO John Antioco about creating the same exclusive rental window for DVDs. Well, Antioco turned down that offer. Lieberfarb, left with no choice, decided that DVDs should be released directly to customers. DVDs were also inexpensive to produce, so they could be sold cheaply.\n\nTim Boyle / Getty Images\n\nBy 2002, DVD players had become, at the time, the fastest-adopted consumer electronics device ever, with around 80 million players sold. Also, retailers like Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Costco, seeing the popularity of DVDs, expanded the footprints of the home entertainment department in their stores, becoming Blockbuster's biggest competitors. In fact, Walmart actually replaced Blockbuster as the studios' largest revenue source for the home entertainment market.\n\nTim Boyle / Getty Images\n\nWith the price of DVDs so low and stores carrying wide selections of both new and older movies, people began to buy movies a lot more \u2014 going from an average of about 5 VHS a year to buying around 15 DVDs a year\u2014 and renting less. If you were around at the time, you probably remember people building big movie collections. The studios benefited hugely from this, as they were making bigger profits from sales. As early as 2002, Blockbuster was seeing the effects of the shift in consumers, and it began to experience declining profits."

            "article_content": "The new candidate for phase-change memory (PCM), which combines the best of short-term memory and long-term storage, consumes far less power than previously identified materials.\n\nScientists may have accidentally overcome a major barrier to smoothening the adoption of next-generation data-storage technologies.\n\nUsing a unique material called indium selenide (In2Se3), researchers say they discovered a technique for lowering the energy requirements of phase-change memory (PCM) \u2014 a technology capable of storing data without a constant power supply \u2014 by up to 1 billion times.\n\nThe breakthrough is a step toward overcoming one of the biggest challenges in PCM data storage, potentially paving the way for low-power memory devices and electronics, the researchers said in a study published Nov. 6 in the journal Nature .\n\nPCM is a leading candidate for universal memory \u2014 computing memory that can replace both short-term memory like random access memory (RAM) and storage devices like solid-state drives (SSDs) or hard drives. RAM is fast but needs significant physical space and a constant power supply to run, while SSDs or hard drives are much denser and can store data while computers are turned off. Universal memory combines the best of both.\n\nIt works by toggling materials between two states: crystalline, where atoms are neatly ordered, and amorphous, where atoms are randomly arranged. These states correlate to binary 1s and 0s, encoding data via switches in states.\n\nHowever, the \"melt-quench technique\" used to toggle these states \u2014 which involves heating and rapidly cooling PCM materials \u2014 requires significant energy, making the technology expensive and difficult to scale. In their study, the researchers found a way to bypass the melt-quench process entirely by instead inducing amorphization through an electrical charge. This slashes PCM's energy requirements and potentially opens the door to broader commercial applications.\n\n\"One of the reasons why phase-change memory devices haven't reached widespread use is due to the energy required,\" study author Ritesh Agarwal , a professor of materials science and engineering at Penn Engineering, said in a statement . The potential of these findings for designing low-power memory devices is \"tremendous,\" he said.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Ferroelectric materials can spontaneously polarize, meaning they can generate an internal electric field without needing an external charge. Piezoelectric materials, by contrast, physically deform when they are exposed to an electric charge.\n\nWhile testing the material, the researchers observed that sections of it amorphized when they were exposed to a continuous current. What's more, this happened entirely by chance.\n\n\"I actually thought I might have damaged the wires, study co-author Gaurav Modi , a former doctoral student in materials science and engineering at Penn Engineering, said in the statement. \"Normally, you would need electrical pulses to induce any kind of amorphization, and here a continuous current had disrupted the crystalline structure, which shouldn't have happened.\"\n\nFurther analysis revealed a chain reaction triggered by the semiconductor's properties. This begins with tiny deformations in the material caused by the current that triggers an \"acoustic jerk\" \u2014 a sound wave similar to seismic activity during an earthquake. This then travels through the material, spreading amorphization across micrometer-scale regions in a mechanism the researchers likened to an avalanche gathering momentum.\n\nThe researchers explained that various properties of indium selenide \u2014 including its two-dimensional structure, ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity \u2014 work together to enable an ultra-low-energy pathway for amorphization triggered by shocks. This could lay the groundwork for future research around \"new materials and devices for low-power electronic and photonic applications,\" they wrote in the study.\n\n\"This opens up a new field on the structural transformations that can happen in a material when all these properties come together,\" Agarwal said in the statement."

DOI: 10.1016/j.jasrep.2024.104891\n\nA discovery deep within a cave in Spain has challenged the history of human artistic expression. Researchers have determined that hand stencils in Maltravieso Cave are more than 66,000 years old, suggesting that Neanderthals, not modern humans, were the world's first artists.\n\nStencils and prints of the human hand are some of the earliest forms of deliberately created visual artwork preserved in the archaeological record. Maltravieso Cave houses more than 60 red hand stencils, but their precise ages have remained a mystery.\n\nDetermining the age of cave art is usually challenging because mineral-based pigments cannot be dated using carbon dating methods.\n\nResearchers from the University of Southampton and collaborating institutions have put hard limits on how recent they can be using the U-series dating method on calcium carbonate crusts covering portions of the art.\n\nIn the study titled \"The age of hand stencils in Maltravieso cave (Extremadura, Spain) established by U-Th dating, and its implications for the early development of art,\" published in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports, researchers applied U-series dating to calcium carbonate crusts overlying the hand stencils in the cave's Sala de las Pinturas and Galer\u00eda de la Serpiente.\n\nThe team collected carbonate samples overlying pigment on hand stencils and performed U-series dating at the Ocean and Earth Science analytical geochemistry facilities at the University of Southampton.\n\nThe U-series dating method is considered non-destructive because it does not use any material from the artwork itself. It only requires tiny amounts of the mineral deposits that cover portions of the artwork, preserving the integrity of the find.\n\nA total of 22 carbonate samples were analyzed. Minimum ages for the cave art range from the Holocene to the Middle Paleolithic. The crust covering the hand stencils in the deepest recess of the cave dates to 66,700 years ago, suggesting that Neanderthals likely created these illustrations.\n\nIt is possible that modern humans made some of the art, as the carbonate crust has only covered pigments on certain images for approximately 6,000 years, though the art itself could be much older. Moisture and carbonate formations are not uniform and can vary in deposit locations over time. The oldest three samples were dated 46,600, 55,240 and 66,710 years ago.\n\nHow U-series dating works\n\nIsotopes of uranium decay into thorium at a set rate, which makes U-series dating suitable for samples ranging from a few hundred to around 500,000 years. On the surface, the soil has a mixture of uranium and thorium isotopes with no way to distinguish which thorium has decayed from what uranium isotope, making exposed soil impossible to date.\n\nWhen it rains, only the uranium is water soluble, hitching a ride in the water while leaving the thorium in place. Surface water often works its way into underground caves, leaching in from the surface above.\n\nThe water brings with it an assortment of soluble minerals, including the uranium isotopes, that form calcium carbonate crusts when the water evaporates, building up over time to create cemented sediments.\n\nIt is within the layers of calcium carbonate that the conversion of uranium to thorium can be measured in isolation, ticking away like a clock over thousands of years. By analyzing the uranium-to-thorium ratio of calcium carbonate crusts that cover ancient cave art, researchers can accurately date the crust and, by default, provide a minimum age for the application of the underlying pigment.\n\nThese results suggest that the tradition of making hand stencils in Europe began long before they appeared in any other part of the world. The oldest known hand stencil art previous to this is located in the Leang Timpuseng Cave on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. U-series dating of mineral deposits overlying the stencil there indicates a minimum age of 39,900 years.\n\nHandprints and footprints found on the Tibetan Plateau have been dated to approximately 200,000 years ago. Children would have pressed these into the mud near a hot mineral spring, and there is an ongoing debate about whether these prints represent deliberate artistic expression or are simply traces left by human activity.\n\nPreviously, a team of researchers at the Cave of La Pasiega, also in Spain, used U-series dating to discover that the iconic red dot art had to be older than 64,800 years. The red dot style is found throughout ancient cave art of Spain, and while most of it is undated, the picture is becoming clearer with this current finding that the Neanderthals of Spain were actively engaged in artistic pursuits.\n\nMore information: Christopher D.

            "article_content": "\u201cThe web is a collection of data, but it\u2019s a mess,\" says Exa cofounder and CEO Will Bryk. \"There's a Joe Rogan video over here, an Atlantic article over there. There's no organization. But the dream is for the web to feel like a database.\u201d\n\nWebsets is aimed at power users who need to look for things that other search engines aren\u2019t great at finding, such as types of people or companies. Ask it for \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and you get a list of specific companies hundreds long rather than hit-or-miss links to web pages that mention those terms. Google can\u2019t do that, says Bryk: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of valuable use cases for investors or recruiters or really anyone who wants any sort of data set from the web.\u201d\n\nThings have moved fast since MIT Technology Review broke the news in 2021 that Google researchers were exploring the use of large language models in a new kind of search engine. The idea soon attracted fierce critics. But tech companies took little notice. Three years on, giants like Google and Microsoft jostle with a raft of buzzy newcomers like Perplexity and OpenAI, which launched ChatGPT Search in October, for a piece of this hot new trend.\n\nExa isn\u2019t (yet) trying to out-do any of those companies. Instead, it\u2019s proposing something new. Most other search firms wrap large language models around existing search engines, using the models to analyze a user\u2019s query and then summarize the results. But the search engines themselves haven\u2019t changed much. Perplexity still directs its queries to Google Search or Bing, for example. Think of today\u2019s AI search engines as a sandwich with fresh bread but stale filling.\n\nMore than keywords\n\nExa provides users with familiar lists of links but uses the tech behind large language models to reinvent how search itself is done. Here\u2019s the basic idea: Google works by crawling the web and building a vast index of keywords that then get matched to users\u2019 queries. Exa crawls the web and encodes the contents of web pages into a format known as embeddings, which can be processed by large language models.\n\nEmbeddings turn words into numbers in such a way that words with similar meanings become numbers with similar values. In effect, this lets Exa capture the meaning of text on web pages, not just the keywords.\n\nA screenshot of Websets showing results for the search: \"companies; startups; US-based; healthcare focus; technical co-founder\"\n\nLarge language models use embeddings to predict the next words in a sentence. Exa\u2019s search engine predicts the next link. Type \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and the model will come up with (real) links that might follow that phrase.\n\nExa\u2019s approach comes at cost, however. Encoding pages rather than indexing keywords is slow and expensive. Exa has encoded some billion web pages, says Bryk. That\u2019s tiny next to Google, which has indexed around a trillion. But Bryk doesn\u2019t see this as a problem: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to embed the whole web to be useful,\u201d he says. (Fun fact: \u201cexa\u201d means a 1 followed by 18 0s and \u201cgoogol\u201d means a 1 followed by 100 0s.)"

            "article_content": "2025 promises to be a pivotal moment in the evolution of software development, driven by the relentless advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). As AI continues to permeate every facet of our lives, its impact on the software development landscape is undeniable. From automating mundane tasks to revolutionizing the creative process, AI is poised to reshape the way we build and deploy software.\n\nDevPro Journal recently spoke with Bhavani Vangala, VP of Engineering at Onymos, who identified five key trends that will significantly influence software development in 2025. By understanding these trends, developers can harness the power of AI to streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and create more innovative and sophisticated applications.\n\nSkepticism Around Current AI Deployments Will Foster More Thoughtful and Scalable Future AI Development\n\nVangala says AI has become a crucial topic for executives and technology leaders over the past two years, especially following the surge of generative AI tools and models in late 2022 and early 2023. However, he adds that there is growing skepticism about whether some current AI deployments are truly production-ready solutions or just conceptual and document-level implementations driven by hype\u2014especially in the healthcare, finance, legal, and manufacturing industries. \u201cIn 2025, enterprises will increasingly evaluate their end-customer needs to accurately gauge AI\u2019s potential impact, assess the relevance of new AI trends for their businesses, and determine whether their development efforts will yield a return on investment,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis evaluation process will lead to more enterprises focusing their AI efforts on delivering tangible and scalable AI that will solve a particular need or challenge for their customers and businesses.\u201d\n\nThe Next Wave of Generative AI Model Training Will Focus on Improving Inference and Reasoning\n\n\u201cThe next wave of generative AI model training in 2025 is set to be transformative, focusing on enhancing reasoning and inference capabilities to make AI responses more intuitive and aligned with human thought processes,\u201d says Vangala. \u201cOpenAI\u2019s recent release of models like o1-preview models this shift, demonstrating significant improvements in inference and reasoning abilities. These advancements enable AI to process and respond to prompts with increased coherence and contextual awareness, marking a promising step forward.\u201d\n\nCurrent generative AI models often require detailed prompts and follow-up questions to provide accurate responses, especially for complex or nuanced inquiries, he adds. \u201cThis reliance on precise inputs can make interactions feel less fluid, as users must know how to phrase questions specifically to achieve accurate responses. Ongoing training efforts over the next year will aim to make AI\u2019s reasoning processes more natural and adaptable, enabling models to grasp context dynamically, consider implicit details, and apply logical steps similar to human thought patterns. This progression will allow models to not only answer questions but also infer intent and address nuanced needs effectively.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI Will Continue to Improve, Evolving Into Key Collaborative Partner\n\n\u201cWhile models like o1-preview represent substantial progress, the AI field is moving toward even greater strides in making models true collaborative partners,\u201d explains Vangala. \u201cThis involves continuous improvements to help models better emulate the way humans approach complex, layered decision-making. Such progress isn\u2019t just about faster responses\u2014it\u2019s about creating a depth of understanding that lets AI interact in a way that feels smooth, helpful, and highly attuned to user intent. However, human oversight remains vital, especially in sensitive fields like healthcare, finance, and law, where AI should support rather than replace decision-making.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, generative AI will continue to serve as an assistant, providing experts with fast, refined insights they can validate and adapt as needed. This evolution in model training positions AI as an increasingly trusted partner in decision-making and problem-solving, delivering insights with a depth and accuracy close to human judgment while respecting the complexity and nuances of each unique domain. By embracing AI as a collaborative tool rather than an autonomous replacement in the year \u2013 and years to come \u2013 industries can strike a productive balance, leveraging AI\u2019s strengths to enhance human expertise and drive meaningful, responsible advancements.\u201d\n\nAI Will Not Take Away the Roles of Software Developers or Architects\n\nVangala says that while some industries may still be exploring AI solutions at a conceptual level, it\u2019s clear that generative AI tools, especially large language models (LLMs), can improve productivity by summarizing vast amounts of data in minutes.\n\n\u201cThis capability allows professionals to draw insights and make informed decisions more rapidly,\u201d he adds. \u201cHowever, AI will not replace critical roles like software developers and architects in 2025 \u2013 or even in the years to come. Generative AI tools can indeed produce code that developers and enterprises may leverage to accelerate software development.\n\n\u201cWhile this efficiency can appeal to enterprises looking to cut costs and speed up project timelines, AI-generated code requires careful review. The code these tools produce comes from existing text and data shared online, which are contributed for specific purposes or products. Therefore, it cannot be directly integrated by simple copying and pasting.\n\n\u201cSoftware developers and architects must thoroughly review, test, and adapt this code to fit specific software requirements and ensure it\u2019s robust and maintainable over the long term. This means that software developers and architects remain essential to the software lifecycle. They bring the expertise necessary to adapt code to unique applications and to handle the ongoing evolution of software, making their roles crucial for successful development and deployment. As a result, AI is a tool that aids productivity but does not replace the need for experienced professionals in the development field. This blend of AI-driven efficiency and human oversight is particularly relevant across healthcare, finance, legal, retail, and manufacturing industries, where AI serves as an enabler rather than a replacement.\u201d\n\nSmall Language Models Will Gain Popularity for Specific Domains\n\n\u201cIn 2025, growing concerns about cost, infrastructure, and privacy will fuel the development and utilization of small language models [SLMs] across multiple sectors, such as healthcare, law, government, and finance, explains Vangala. \u201cWhile large language models can be beneficial in certain situations, they often necessitate specialized infrastructure and cost, making them less accessible to many companies, especially startups.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, significant privacy and security concerns exist around the data used in training LLMs. This concern is particularly high in healthcare, where safeguarding user (or patient) information is crucial, and model customization is preferred. Just think about it this way: would you be comfortable integrating an LLM based on accurate and misleading data from the web in a tool that assesses cancer risk? By utilizing SLMs, organizations in high-stakes sectors can develop tailored models based on domain-specific and accurate data while ensuring privacy, security, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency.\u201d"

In 2025, regarding quality and security as inseparable components of success will become the standard. This shift is fueled by heightened scrutiny from senior executives who recognize that flaws in either area can directly impact a company\u2019s reputation, revenue, and long-term growth. The days of siloed teams are fading. Instead, QA, development, cybersecurity, and product teams will work in tandem\u2014assuring fluid, cross-department engagement and collaboration, with all teams sharing roles and responsibilities to ensure holistic software integrity.\n\nA key driver of this trend is the push to make tools and processes more integrated. Whether it\u2019s enabling cross-team collaboration or ensuring seamless data sharing, businesses are beginning to recognize that fragmented systems slow innovation. High-quality, centralized solutions should become a core value to all companies who want to succeed in 2025. Resources to support this change should be understood as powerful investments that will aggregate value to the entire company, not only to the operational level. Companies that embrace integrated tools and cross-functional workflows will unlock faster time-to-market, elevate customer trust, and cement themselves as a strong competitor in the market."
