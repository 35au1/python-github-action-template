            "article_content": "Dec. 7\u2014The arcane red light reportedly throbbed in the sky above Albuquerque's South Valley for about an hour in October 2023, caught on camera by a bewildered man who says, \"I've never seen a light that bright.\"\n\nA solid, bright orb drifted with angular elegance in February over Jal, near the state's southern border, startling an observer. As the nighttime scene unfolded near a Lea County oilfield, the observer reported feeling like the air was astir with a leaden static.\n\nVideos of these episodes of stargazing turning bizarre in a state known for enigmatic nighttime occurrences are among those catalogued by a popular UFO reporting platform and cellphone app operated by Enigma Labs. The company, founded in 2020, has issued a new report naming New Mexico its top state for sightings per capita, with several strange videos submitted this year showing lights over Albuquerque.\n\n\"New Mexico is a focal point for UFOs,\" said Alejandro Rojas, a consultant for Enigma Labs. \"But it's really interesting that New Mexico has really popped up in our data lately as being heads above the leader when it comes to submissions per person.\"\n\nThe data set comes as an obsession with unidentified flying objects continues nationwide, even after a congressionally mandated Pentagon report released in February found no evidence the federal government was covering up knowledge of extraterrestrial technology and no evidence UFO sightings are signs of aliens visiting Earth.\n\nA Pentagon office, known as the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, was created in 2022 to track what the government calls UAPs \u2014 unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 with 757 reported to the office between May and June of this year, according to a November report.\n\nStill, people continue to see things.\n\nIn the fast-paced digital age, Enigma Labs provides an online trove of oddities \u2014 an endless proliferation of sights and sounds.\n\nThe private company offers a website and cellphone app allowing UFO enthusiasts \u2014 and regular people who believe they have encountered the anomalous \u2014 to upload videos and photos with descriptions, aggregating and crowdsourcing the data.\n\n\"Like millions of ants crawling around us,\" the individual who spotted something in Jal said in the Enigma post.\n\n\"I hate to say it. Those are ships!\" gushed a man who claimed he was witnessing alien plasma ships in Gallup near the Arizona border.\n\nAll told, the Land of Enchantment's rate of 12.2 Enigma entries per 100,000 people is far higher than the next closest states of Nevada and Arizona, which boast submission rates of around 9 per 100,000 residents, according to the company.\n\nUFO researchers have theories about the large volume of entries here, citing how alien mythology and lore have been woven into the state's cultural fabric for decades. According to the National UFO Reporting Center, 1,708 sightings have been reported in New Mexico, most of them since 2000.\n\n\"We have a relatively small population, but the one thing we do have, and I think this factors into your question, is a preponderance of military operations areas and scientific development areas \u2014 Los Alamos [National Laboratory], Sandia [National Laboratories] \u2014 a rich history of sightings,\" said David Marler, a longtime UFO researcher who lives in the Albuquerque area and serves as the executive director of a new UFO records center in Rio Rancho.\n\nWhile the Roswell incident has long been a dominant talker, Marler said there are many other intriguing reports of encounters over the last 75 years in New Mexico: April 1964, Socorro; April 1964, La Madera; March 1950, Farmington; November 1957, Kirtland Air Force Base.\n\nA prevalent state for sightings\n\nEnigma Labs runs a New Mexico page that archives and cataloging sightings, rating and categorizing videos.\n\nAs of late November, the company had received 278 New Mexico sightings directly, according to an email from Rojas. Combined with publicly available sources, it has 3,531 total sightings in New Mexico archived.\n\n\"When you go back and look at early magazine reports and military reports going back to the 1950s, there were magazine articles showing maps where a lot of UFO sightings. One of the most prevalent states was New Mexico,\" Marler said.\n\nA fascination with the unknown has long gripped New Mexico. It's a state renowned \u2014 thanks to its dry climate, low population density and sprawling deserts \u2014 for its night sky viewing.\n\n\"One of the most spectacular reports is from last August. A witness said they were watching TV when they caught this weird object out of the corner of their eye. They were able to get a few seconds of video before it disappeared behind nearby trees,\" Rojas said of video footage taken in Chaparral, a Southern New Mexico community near El Paso.\n\nThe video shows a floating gray object with a television heard in the background.\n\nNew Mexico sightings logged into the Enigma Labs database break down like this: Albuquerque, 754; Las Cruces, 159; Roswell, 143; Alamogordo, 107; and Deming, 95. Rojas said eight sightings have been reported to Enigma from Santa Fe and one in Los Alamos.\n\nTwo friends were driving along San Mateo Boulevard in Albuquerque late one night in February when a moving craft in the sky lit up with lights flashing in a diagonal pattern.\n\nIn an episode that lasted about a minute, \"it went from a long craft to a triangle shaped craft with only 3 lights, and then to something that resembled a helicopter with one light, and quickly disappeared,\" states the caption on the for the video posted to Enigma Lab's site.\n\nNew records center in Rio Rancho\n\nTens of thousands of case files, among the earliest dated in 1947, are housed in Rio Rancho. They relay the stories of witnesses, couched in the diction of reports written by law enforcement officers or members of the military as far back as 70 years ago.\n\nThe files can be pored over at the new National UFO Historical Records Center, a facility that recently opened and can be visited by appointment.\n\n\"It's the largest historical archive ever assembled on the history of the subject in the history of the United States,\" said Marler, the director.\n\nThe volunteer-operated research center, at 1301 Nicklaus Drive SE, opened in October.\n\nIt holds rolls of decades-old microfilm, hundreds of thousands of audio recordings, an exhaustive library of foreign and domestic magazines, newsletters and periodicals \u2014 all dealing with reports of mysterious craft spotted from Earth. Some 2,000 books line the shelves, along with an interminable supply of UFO investigations and intrigue, with tales and testimony for those who believe.\n\n\"It's really set up for academics and for the general public who have a serious interest in the subject. It's not for the casual enthusiast per se,\" Marler said.\n\nThe center has files from the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena, records kept by the largest citizen organization in the U.S. devoted to cataloguing UFO reports from 1956 until 1980, the year the group published its final newsletter. The center is currently digitizing the files for the first time ever.\n\nAlso in its possession are collections from the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization, once based in Alamogordo, with tens of thousands of case files \u2014 as well as collections from the UFO Research Committee of Akron, especially active in the 1950s in Ohio.\n\n\"We're literally getting these holdings in from all different points of the globe,\" Marler said.\n\nWell-documented cases beyond Roswell\n\nAcademics of unexplained phenomena have descended on the Land of Enchantment for a beloved UFO festival in Roswell. But the mythic narratives don't go dry there.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Roswell, Roswell, Roswell. That always dominates the conversation and there are better, more well-documented cases on file,\" Marler said, referring to the 1947 crash of a craft near the Southern New Mexico city. While many believe it was an extraterrestrial spacecraft, the federal government has said it was a secret military balloon aimed at detecting Soviet atomic bomb tests.\n\nMarler said many New Mexicans aren't aware of other cases within their own state.\n\nIn November of 1957, a UFO was tracked on radar and \"violated\" the perimeter of the Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, hovering around restricted sites, according to reports Marler has reviewed. He said the Rio Rancho records center has the original case file on it from \"Project Blue Book,\" the Air Force name for a project that investigated UFO reports between 1947 and 1969.\n\n\"Two Air Force personnel were observing it with binoculars at night. They described it as looking like a car standing vertically on end with a white light emanating out of the bottom. The object had the ability to hover, to rapidly accelerate, to move slowly,\" Marler said.\n\nThe Socorro incident in April 1964 \u2014 unresolved in the Air Force investigations that transpired at the time and widely reported by New Mexico news publications \u2014 was observed by local police Officer Lonnie Zamora, who claimed he witnessed two humanoids beside a shiny, egg-shaped object that later rose into the air from an arroyo as flames belched from the rising craft.\n\nMarler said he had believed the Socorro case was an isolated one. In the last year, however, he received the APRO files and came across an account published in the Santa Fe New Mexican of a similar report four days after the Socorro incident from La Madera, a remote community north of Ojo Caliente in Rio Arriba County.\n\n\"Eyewitness Recounts Passage of 'Thing' Burning in Sky,\" reads a headline in the April 28, 1964, edition of The New Mexican.\n\n\"It talks about Socorro, but it talks about a landing in La Madera ... and it described an egg-shaped object,\" Marler said. \"... New Mexico State Police [investigated and] drew a detailed diagram of the landing site and took pictures and colored photographs.\""

            "article_content": "Mysterious UFO drones have been spotted flying over New York City - after weeks of being photographed in New Jersey.\n\nStaten Island Borough President Vito Fossella confirmed that the peculiar objects had been seen flying above Howland Hook Marine Terminal and the West Shore on Staten Island earlier this week.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the FAA and FBI requesting an investigation, Fossella called the situation 'bizarre', according to PIX11.\n\n'It is odd and quite bizarre that nobody can figure out who is flying these drones, where they are coming from, and their purpose.\n\n'It is not just a bizarre situation, but also a concerning one, as it seems these drones can potentially become a danger to personal safety.'\n\nHe also stated that he was worried about the drones' ability to impede life-saving care in medical emergencies - especially over the two hospital systems on Staten Island.\n\n'It was recently reported that, during a medical emergency resulting from a crash in Branchburg, New Jersey, the presence of these drones prevented a medevac helicopter from being able to transport a seriously injured patient to the hospital.\n\n'We hope that such an investigation may shed light on what these drones are doing, where they are coming from and how to mitigate the risks they may pose on public safety.'\n\nMysterious UFO drones have been spotted flying over New York City - days after being photographed in New Jersey\n\nYesterday, new footage of at least five or possibly six of the unidentified drones was captured in a 50-second cell phone video in New Jersey, which one commenter declared was 'the clearest video yet.'\n\nOne drone, heard roaring in the skies as it moved through the darkness, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly and red lights blinking at the tips of its wings and tail.\n\nAnother drone came into frame that resembled a classic 'black triangle' UFO or the triangular TR-3B, which beamed bright white lights from its nose, wingtips and tail.\n\nSince mid-November, a wave of unexplained drone sightings above central Jersey has left both law enforcement and the general public watching the skies, hunting for clues on what these mysterious night flights might be.\n\nGovernor Phil Murphy has attempted to calm residents claiming these true UFOs pose 'no known threat to the public at this time,' but FBI and local police are actively investigating.\n\nConcerns have heightened over the proximity of these drone-like UFOs to President-elect Donald Trump's Bedminster golf course, US military research facility Picatinny Arsenal and critical local infrastructure.\n\n'Water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, police departments, and military installations' have all had the UFOs roaming above them in recent weeks, according to the chief of police for the New Jersey borough of Florham Park.\n\n'Their presence appears nefarious in nature,' the police chief added.\n\nStaten Island Borough President Vito Fossella confirmed that the peculiar objects had been seen flying above Howland Hook Marine Terminal and the West Shore on Staten Island earlier this week\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' NJ native and TikTok creator @_bucky13 commented under his phone footage of the eerie drones (still image above), captioned 'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.' At least five drone-like UFOs are seen in his 50-second clip\n\nOne of the UFO drones, whose engines can be heard roaring from the ground, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly with red lights blinking at its wingtips and tail (above)\n\nBut the New Jersian who posted the new footage of these drones online maintains the answer lies within America's own classified world of black budget projects.\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' TikTok user @_bucky13 commented under his phone video of the eerie UFOs, captioned\n\n'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.'\n\n'I think they are trying to scare Russia by demonstrating some secret weapons,' he wrote.\n\nThe camera was pointed to the sky when the drones came into view.\n\n'There they are! There are more in New Jersey!,' he can be heard shouting in his handheld video \u2014 as an unsettled woman off-camera says, 'We shouldn't be outside.'\n\n'They look like an f***ing triangle! They look like a triangle,' he said in disbelief, as je spotted a triangular-shaped drone cruising into the night.\n\nA later UFO or drone seemed to hover stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect.\n\n'Are you freaking kidding me right now,' one woman can be heard saying of the craft.\n\nCommenters of UFO video joined him in his suspicion that the objects may ultimately prove to be top secret US military craft, even as the TikToker can be heard marveling in his video that 'an F-16 just flew over' in hot pursuit of the unidentified craft.\n\nAccording to one NJ local, this image depicts roughly nine of the unidentified drones flying in to the Garden State from the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday night, December 5\n\nA later UFO or drone in the new video looks like it might have hovered stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect\n\n'Looks like a military drone,' one Tik Tok user said, with another chiming in 'Definitely government made drones.'\n\nMany stated with confidence that the triangle craft was the legendary and still unconfirmed TR-3B 'Black Manta' anti-gravity spy plane, the alleged follow-up to the equally unconfirmed TR-3A, both claimed to have been made by defense contractor Northrop in the early 1990s.\n\n'Those are TR-3B government drones,' one poster said. 'Look them up, they're pretty cool.'\n\nA December 1991 cover story in Popular Mechanics was one of the first mainstream media reports to allege that the TR-3A existed as a highly advanced 'tactical reconnaissance vehicle' eyewitnesses said was 42-feet long with a 60-foot wingspan.\n\nOthers have speculated that the UFOs above New Jersey might be an update to US defense contractor Lockheed Martin\u2019s original 'Darkstar' that flew in 1996."

Apple\n\nApple's iOS 18.2 update is expected to launch this week with new AI features and improvements.\n\nThe earlier release candidate version included ChatGPT integration, Genmojis, and Image Playground.\n\nThe new features will be available to iPhone 16 models and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nIf you shrugged at Apple's first AI features, the next batch may prove to be a more meaningful update.\n\nApple's iOS 18.2 release candidate version was released on Thursday, offering an early glimpse at what's expected to launch for users in the coming days.\n\nApple's AI software, Apple Intelligence, launched its first set of features on October 28. The upgrade included a revamped Siri, AI writing tools, smart replies, an updated Photos app, and a new focus mode called Reduce Interruptions.\n\nIt was a fraction of the flashy AI features Apple showed off at its Worldwide Developer Conference earlier this year, as the company decided to do a staggered rollout. This second wave of features will be followed by more launching next year.\n\nSo what can you expect when you update to iOS 18.2 later this week?\n\nAnticipated features in the December update include tools like Genmojis and Image Playground, among others. Like the earlier Apple Intelligence features, the newest AI features will be available for all iPhone 16 models and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nChatGPT integration\n\nApple's iOS 18.2 introduces ChatGPT integration. Apple\n\nSiri received some enhancements in the iOS 18.1 update, but the iOS 18.2 update will further improve the voice assistant and allow integrated access to ChatGPT. With iOS 18.2, users will have access to the popular OpenAI chatbot through Siri and they'll be able to access the tool by talking to the voice assistant or typing to it.\n\nVisual Intelligence\n\nApple's visual intelligence feature is expected in iOS 18.2 Apple\n\nThe new update will also allow iPhone 16 users to gather information by pointing their device at an object.\n\nThe tool is similar to Google Lens, which does reverse image searches and helps identify landmarks, plants, and other objects or places.\n\nGenmojis\n\nCreate a personalized \"Genmoji.\" Apple\n\nFor those who prefer to communicate with emojis over the written word, Genmojis could be a game changer.\n\nThe new update allows users to be more playful and interactive in their messages, creating custom emojis right from the keyboard and animated Genmojis of themselves, similar to Bitmoji.\n\nImage Playground\n\nImage Playground was introduced at Apple's WWDC 2024. Apple\n\nApple's Image Playground is its answer to popular AI image generators like OpenAI's Dall-E or Midjourney. The tool was first demonstrated at Apple's WWDC conference earlier this year.\n\nImage Playground users can create images based on a specific description or concept and will be able to select different formats like animation.

            "article_content": "Your baby\u2019s bassinet or crib doesn\u2019t only impact their sleep, it also impacts yours. I\u2019m a new mom, with my little one having been born at the end of September, and we\u2019ve been using Cradlewise\u2019s smart bassinet consistently for the past month. While it's not a foolproof method of getting your baby to sleep (is any crib foolproof?), it has helped reduce the need to intervene. Less intervention means more sleep for both me and my babe, so I\u2019m a fan of Cradlewise.\n\nCradlewise has all the gadgets built in: a baby monitor, a sound machine, and even a bouncing motion to soothe Baby. The latter two are completely customizable from the Cradlewise app. But it\u2019s not just gadget-packed\u2014the app has AI within it that will use the camera and microphone to track and categorize Baby\u2019s sleep, and react when Baby is fussy.\n\nCradlewise has worked to help keep my baby asleep, oftentimes responding to him before I do. On his most recent nap, I watched him through the app as he went in and out of fussing, eventually being soothed back asleep by the crib\u2019s bouncing. During that time, I was able to write this review. I\u2019m sold.\n\nBaby\u2019s First AI\n\nCradlewise\u2019s AI is designed to learn your baby\u2019s sleep habits so it can respond appropriately. Considering I\u2019m in the thick of the newborn haze, I\u2019ll happily welcome anything to help with sleep at this stage. The crib\u2019s monitor, built into the crib\u2019s overhanging arc, uses 3D-image mapping technology to detect the baby\u2019s sleep state from quiet, active, or crying. AI interprets and categorizes this information to respond by either bouncing Baby, kicking on the sound machine, or both. The more the built-in AI is able to understand and predict your baby\u2019s sleep habits, the more it can take a preventative approach to your baby\u2019s fussing and stirs.\n\nI was hesitant to rely on AI for my baby's sleep, but Cradlewise is designed to respond like a parent would to a baby fussing. It\u2019ll start soothing with a gentle bouncing motion and turn on the sound machine. If your baby is still protesting sleep, it\u2019ll respond by increasing the bounce motion and volume of sound. When the crib recognizes your baby is soothed back to sleep, all functions turn off. If the baby can\u2019t be soothed by these actions, it\u2019ll send an alert through the app.\n\nPhotograph: Cradlewise\n\nThrough the app, you have full control of everything from the intensity of the bouncing motion to the sound machine\u2019s volume. Neither is constant, so your little one is less likely to become reliant on either to fall asleep. I\u2019ve been using the sensitivity setting on high so the bassinet responds almost instantly to my child's stirring or sounds. When he stirs, I wait to see if Cradlewise can soothe him back to sleep. About half the time, it will. On the downside, sometimes the bassinet will increase the bouncing motion too soon, from a gentle bounce to a level three or four (level four being the highest bounce intensity), which often feels too aggressive and even counterproductive to get my baby to sleep. When this happens, I turn the intensity down myself. Hopefully this is a pattern the AI will eventually pick up on and readjust to, but so far, it hasn't."

            "article_content": "The controversy surrounding the Conjuring House owner's claim of being contacted by a spirit from the 1800s and the allegations that followed.\n\nFor years, even before the age of cinema, ghost stories have been a staple form of entertainment for millions of people worldwide. The world of the supernatural has thus found a special place in the entertainment industry as well, where horror stories are consumed, loved, and adored by fans across the world. Among the many such stories, The Conjuring Universe is especially famous for its spine-chilling back story.\n\nA still from The Conjuring | Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nBased on the real-life story of the Perron family and the subsequent investigation carried out by famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren on their infamous haunted farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971, The Conjuring is a tale that sends shivers down our spines. Even more haunting is that the centuries-old haunted house located in Burrillville, Rhode Island continues to experience repeated supernatural activity and can even be booked by supernatural enthusiasts to experience these activities.\n\nHowever, the current owner of the \u2018Conjuring\u2018 house has been facing backlash and criticism after her recent claims of being contacted by one of the original owners of the house and her subsequent firing of an employee, even losing her business entertainment license in the process.\n\nOwner of the Conjuring House Contact by the OG Owner of the Infamous Estate\n\nThe Conjuring House aka the Arnold estate | Credit: The Conjuring House.com\n\nLocated in Burrillville, the colonial-era Old Arnold Estate spread across 8.5 acres in Rhode Island has always been a center of paranormal activity (via The Conjuring House.com). Made famous by the 2013 movie, The Conjuring, its relationship with otherworldly activities goes as far as the 1700s and is supposed to be haunted by several spirits and entities. Hence, when the farmhouse was up for purchase in 2022, the Boston attorney Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez purchased it without a second thought.\n\nHaving a long-standing relationship with the spiritual and supernatural world, Nu\u00f1ez has since transformed it into a business for horror enthusiasts to come and visit or stay at the house. The business was thriving until recently when she claimed to have been contacted by the spirit of John Arnold, one of the original owners of the estate from back in the 1800s. According to what she told WPRI, Arnold told her that one of her employees was stealing from her.\n\nI did get a message from John Arnold from the 1800s. I also have records of merchandise and stuff, and know that he stole.\n\nSince then, her story has gained attention from fans all over the world. While some fans believe her story, others remain skeptical and have criticized her decision to fire an employee. In the middle of all this controversy, she also lost her business entertainment license after the Burrillville town officials voted to not have it renewed citing concerns over her conduct and the disruption caused by the 24-hour business in a residential area.\n\nConjuring House Owner Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez Has Been Accused of Several Problematic Conducts\n\nThe owner of the Conjuring house, Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez | Credit: WPRI / FaceBook\n\nThe Conjuring House remains at the top of bucket lists for a lot of fans, and visiting the house at least once is a die-hard wish of several horror enthusiasts. However, soon that might change given how Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez has lost her license to continue her business of letting people visit the huge haunted estate. And a lot of it is to blame for her alleged problematic behavior, which allegedly has gotten worse since she purchased the house.\n\nAs reported by WPRI, she was arrested for drunk driving in October and also accused of threatening one of her past employees Jason Hawes as well as his family. Hawes, the star of the hit Ghostbuster series, revealed to the site that Nu\u00f1ez has sent her threatening messages even after the court lauded her with a no-contact order. Meanwhile, Nu\u00f1ez stated that she is now looking to file lawsuits against him, formal employees, and even Burrillville for how \u201cthey have just blatantly violated\u201d her constitutional protections.\n\nMeanwhile, the town manager of Burrillville, Micahel Wood revealed to the news site that the Conjuring House owner runs a 24-hour business in a residential area which is quite \u201cdisruptive to neighbors, and it draws curious people at all hours of the day and night.\u201d Furthermore, he stated that Nu\u00f1ez has been \u201cdifficult, uncooperative, and aggressive throughout the licensing process,\u201d which makes it hard for their cooperative relationship to resume. On the other hand, Nu\u00f1ez believes the town isn\u2019t letting her run her business since they have no care for the paranormal.\n\nThe Conjuring House Employee Believes in the Paranormal But Thinks Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s Claims Are Far-Fetched\n\nThe Conjuring | Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nWhile Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez wholeheartedly believes and claims that the spirit of John Arnold contacted her and informed her that one of her employees was stealing from her, her employee believes that Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s claims are a bit far-fetched. Brian Dansereau had been working at the Burrillville farmhouse for quite a while now, however, Nu\u00f1ez fired him last month claiming he had stolen about $3000 from her.\n\nDansereau has consistently denied the theft and even though he believes in the paranormal he thinks there is no way that the spirit of one of the former owners of the house from back in the 1800s would have contacted Nu\u00f1ez and told her something like this. While talking to WPRI, he stated,\n\nShe said, \u2018John Arnold told me you\u2019ve been stealing money out of the cash box for the past two months.\u2019 I literally stopped and I had to correct her like, \u2018John Arnold, one of the original owners?\u2019\n\nThe Conjuring House | Credit: The Conjuring House.com\n\nHe also shared his own paranormal experiences, such as hearing his voice in the basement or witnessing doors opening on their own. Yet, he cannot fathom a spirit snitching on an employee. On the other hand, Nu\u00f1ez claimed that she had been informed of other unexpected conduct from the past staff and guests and does not care if someone believes her or not.\n\nIt does not matter whether you believe in the paranormal or not. I and every person is entitled to experiences that bring understanding and meaning to our lives, including being informed or warned about wicked actors and actions. As far as Brian goes my experience with him devolved quickly, culminating in his at-will employment termination.\n\nNu\u00f1ez is thus planning to file a complaint with state officials, also because her former employee has been allegedly trying to damage her reputation by slandering her. What should have been a grand experience for fans of Conjuring and horror enthusiasts has taken a turn for the worst. There is a possibility that the tours and fan visits at the Conjuring house may not be possible in the future for Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez has no plans to sell the house even if she does not get her business license back.\n\nThe Conjuring is available to be streamed on Netflix."

Kincaid.\n\nThe Mount Hope resident, who launched her writing and illustrating career in 2007, will be featured at a special meet-and-greet next week in Oak Hill. The public can mingle with Kincaid from 6-8 p.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 10, at the administration building behind the Oak Hill Library branch.\n\n\u201cFor anyone interested in writing, I would say just do it,\u201d Kincaid says. \u201cDon\u2019t try to be super eloquent and sophisticated in your writing, just tell the story.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter all, if the point is to entertain, don\u2019t fill your story with words the reader constantly has to pull out a dictionary to understand what you are trying to say.\u201d\n\nKincaid said she\u2019s matured as a writer since her first endeavor, a children\u2019s book entitled \u201cThe Adventures of Casey the Lost Suitcase,\u201d which she penned as Tracy S. Kincaid. \u201cMy aunt had gone to Italy, but her suitcase didn\u2019t,\u201d she said in describing the concept of the children\u2019s book. \u201cWhen the suitcase was finally returned to her after 10 months, it had all of the security tags of where it had traveled. So, I got the idea to write the book from the suitcase\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\nThe book lacked proper editing at the time, she said. \u201cThe problem with \u2018Casey,\u2019 although it was a great idea, was that it was never edited,\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller, not an editor. Therefore, although well received, the writing had that flaw.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have written several other children\u2019s books since, but am still working on illustrations and they have not yet been published,\u201d she added.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past eight years, she has moved into longer-form novels. \u201cThe Factory in the Crooked Hollow,\u201d published in 2016, was her first attempt at horror, she said. At the time, Kincaid wanted to distinguish her children\u2019s books from her adult books and changed her pen name to T.S. Kincaid. \u201cIn the meantime, I discovered there is another author by the name of Tracy Kincaid, so I decided to be T.S. Kincaid from now on. Although \u2018Factory\u2019 had been edited, I feel I did more telling than showing in this novella.\u201d\n\nFast forward a few years, and Kincaid dipped her toes into the novel pool again. \u201cAfter much research and soul searching, I decided to write \u2018I\u2019m Timmy,\u2019\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cThis book is the first in a series, with the next book being \u2018I\u2019m Klara,\u2019 which I am currently writing. I am very excited about this series because so far it has been well received and I feel I have finally mastered the craft of storytelling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Timmy\u201d was self-published in September 2024 and is currently available at booksellers such as Amazon and Barnes and Noble. She will also have it on hand for $10 (normally $14.99) at the Oak Hill event. \u201cI decided to self-publish my \u2018I\u2019m Timmy\u2019 series due to the fact that I am older (I\u2019m 61), and wanted to get my stories out into the world instead of waiting to be picked up by a traditional publisher, which may or may not happen,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I work on my writing and illustrating full time.\u201d\n\nWhat prompted her to move into the horror genre? \u201cMost of the ideas that I get for writing my scary stories are from dreams that I have. I love horror stories and feel comfortable writing this genre.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMost of my books have an educational element to them,\u201d she continued. \u201cWith my children\u2019s books, I cover subjects like geography, math, a lot of imagination and a little bit of humor.\n\n\u201cWith my horror stories, I try to give the reader a new perspective and something to think about. Explaining the paranormal in ways that perhaps they had not thought about.\u201d\n\nTo complement her writing, Kincaid also has a \u201cwhisper room,\u201d or \u201cpod\u201d as she calls it, in her home in a sound-proof room built for her by her husband.\n\nThere, she \u201ccan do voiceovers and audio books,\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cI have a background in theater and I love recording and bringing written books to life.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI recorded the audio book for \u2018I\u2019m Timmy\u2019 with sound effects and music. That audio book was recorded in a professional studio in Sevierville, Tenn. by Lions Creative. It is due to be released soon.\n\n\u201cMy hopes and dreams for my writing, of course, is to be a best seller one day. However, I am perfectly happy writing stories that people enjoy reading and is something they will remember long after they have laid the book down. \u2018I\u2019m Timmy\u2019 is a dark and sad paranormal story and not for everyone, but it is an easy read and, once the reader is engaged, it is hard to put down.\u201d\n\nKincaid is available for lectures and to discuss the book with reading clubs, and is open to any questions from readers through her website, www.tskincaid.com."

In the clip, they recreated a vintage photo from when they were younger and were filming the show.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still just kids,\u201d they captioned the post.\n\nOn September 10, 2009, Dobrev, Graham, and King made their on-screen debut together. Although Dobrev left the program at the end of season six, he reappeared for an appearance in the series finale. The Vampire Diaries ran for eight seasons before ending in 2017.\n\nThe romantic triangle between teenage Elena and two vampire brothers, Stefan Salvatore (Wesley) and Damon Salvatore (Somerhalder), was the focus of the popular program, which also starred Paul Wesley and Damon Salvatore.\n\nHowever, peril and catastrophe trailed behind them, drawing Elena and her companions into the paranormal realm of Mystic Falls, Virginia, which was teeming with werewolves, witches, vampires, and more.\n\nOther former cast members of Vampire Diaries also attended the Covington fan conference, in addition to Dobrev, Graham, and King. Additionally present were Wesley, Somerhalder, Zach Roerig (Matt), Arielle Kebbel (Lexi), Michael Malarkey (Enzo), and others.\n\nShowrunner Julie Plec reflected on the series she co-created with Kevin Williamson and how it spawned a supernatural franchise that includes The Originals and Legacies earlier this year, in honour of the show's 15th anniversary of premiere.\n\nDuring her chat with The Hollywood Reporter, she recalled wanting to \u201ctell a really emotional story that was sexy and romantic and scary and all the things,\u201d while also creating \u201csomething that felt timeless, that could live on and continue to feel like anybody, any generation at any time can connect to it.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Is mathematics a discovery or an invention?\n\nThe answers to this question are an important part of the philosophy of mathematics. To answer it, philosophers would like to know whether mathematics is a natural part of this world that existed before humans discovered and comprehended it or if mathematics was invented by humans.\n\nIn this discussion, experts have developed many different ideas. A particularly popular one is mathematical realism: according to this view, mathematics is real irrespective of whether there is a human mind to comprehend it. In other words, it stipulates that human minds discovered mathematics rather than creating it.\n\nThere has been some support from evolution for this view. Insects called cicadas live underground but emerge every few years to eat foot, reproduce, and then die. This year, three broods of cicadas emerged at the same time: one with a 13-year cycle, one with a 17-year cycle, and one with a seven-year cycle. It\u2019s the first such event in 1,547 years.\n\nSeven, 137, and 17 are all prime numbers, and some scientists believe evolution opted for them to avoid predators that emerge from underground to hunt cicadas at periodic intervals. By keeping their emergence cycle to a prime number of years, cicadas have a better chance of avoiding the predators\u2019 more predictable cycles.\n\nThere are many types of realism as well, including Platonic, mathematicism, and logicism. Other, alternative positions on the nature of mathematics include structuralism, fictionalism, and social constructivism."

Learn More.\n\nOpenAI awarded a $1 million grant to a Duke University team of researchers seeking to explore AI algorithms capable of predicting people\u2019s moral judgment. The grant invests in academic research into \u201cAI morality\u201d as debates on the ethical use of artificial intelligence continue to gain steam in public discourse. Duke has been researching the use of AI to aid people in exercising ethical decisions, producing resources on ethics involving the latest AI technologies.\n\nThe study, \u201cMaking Moral AI,\u201d is being conducted by Duke\u2019s Moral Attitudes and Decisions Lab (MADLAB) and led by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, professor of practical ethics and the project\u2019s principal investigator. Co-investigator Jana Schaich Borg of the Social Science Research Institute joins him on the project.\n\nMADLAB is an interdisciplinary laboratory designed to understand various factors that shape and influence people\u2019s \u201cmoral attitudes, decisions, and judgments.\u201d Researchers have been trying to understand the role of AI and how it can be used as a \u201cmoral GPS\u201d to help people make better judgments guided by ethical standards and traditions, drawing on \u201ccomputer science, data science, philosophy, economics, game theory, psychology, and neuroscience.\u201d\n\nAbout the OpenAI Grant\n\nOpenAI\u2019s grant will be used to \u201cdevelop algorithms that can predict human moral judgments in scenarios involving conflicts among morally relevant features in medicine, law, and business,\u201d according to a Duke press release. Information about the research grant has not been publicized, but it would be a good start for OpenAI to invest in such an effort. Ethics is highly nuanced. It\u2019s still a long shot for current technologies to grasp the nuances of moral judgments\u2014especially when human emotion also plays a crucial role.\n\nAI models are trained to calculate and compute data and statistics. Large language models mostly rely on patterns in language and reasoning to generate predictions. Various fields are involved in morality research, including philosophy, sociocultural studies, and psychology. Combining these disciplines with AI, computer science, and data science would be an enormous task. It also takes time to fully integrate social sciences and philosophy insights into AI algorithms.\n\nRead our guide to navigating AI\u2019s ethical challenges or our look at the ethics of generative AI models to learn more."

            "source": "Business Insider",
            "article_content": "Kevin Weil showed no sign of the heat when he took to the stage at the Marriott Marquis in downtown San Francisco on an unseasonably sweaty early October morning.\n\nTrim and tan, outfitted in the de rigueur Silicon Valley uniform of a slim-fit gray tee, stonewashed blue jeans, and an Apple Watch Ultra, the chief product officer of OpenAI talked easily about the ambitious artificial intelligence-powered future his red-hot employer was building.\n\n\"You could imagine a world where you ask it a hard question about how you cure some particular form of cancer, and you let it think for five hours, five days, five months,\" Weil prophesied in response to a question about the \"reasoning capabilities\" of AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut neither he nor his onstage interlocutor, Anyscale cofounder Robert Nishihara, ever acknowledged the elephant in the room: Weil wasn't supposed to be there.\n\nThe event, the AI infrastructure conference Ray Summit, had originally booked OpenAI's chief technology officer, Mira Murati, to speak. Just days before, the high-profile executive had abruptly quit, prompting the last-minute swap. Murati's exit added to a long list of recent departures from OpenAI, one of the world's most valuable and hyped startups, even as it closed a historic $6.6 billion funding round on the day Weil spoke.\n\nIf Sam Altman is the starry-eyed visionary of OpenAI, Weil is its executor. He leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services it can sell, putting him at the center of a philosophical rift that has caused spectacular upheaval at the company, which was recently valued at $157 billion.\n\nIn two years, OpenAI went from a nonprofit lab nominally working to develop digital intelligence for the public good to a world-famous startup that puts out shiny new products and models every few months. The company is now attempting to become a for-profit operation to lure would-be backers to write bigger checks, which it needs to scale its business. Altman recently announced that the company's flagship product, ChatGPT, now has 300 million weekly users, triple the number it had a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with this astronomical growth, OpenAI has succumbed to a brain drain: Its chief research officer, head of AGI readiness, co-lead of its video-generation model Sora, and the list goes on. While this has sparked alarm bells in some corners of the tech industry, it has also elevated the profile of the senior leaders who have remained. That includes Weil, a relative OpenAI newcomer who joined in June and rapidly became one of its most notable ambassadors.\n\nAt a point when employee voices of dissent were growing louder, 41-year-old Weil arrived as a steady-handed product guru with a Midas touch. He was a longtime Twitter insider who created products that made the social media company money during a revolving door of chief executives.\n\nAt Instagram, he helped kneecap Snapchat's growth with competitive product releases such as Stories and live video. (Not everything he touched turned to gold, though. Weil also led Facebook's headlong charge into financial services as a cofounder of Libra, its ill-fated stablecoin.)\n\nWeil declined to be interviewed for this article, which is based on conversations with five former senior colleagues, four of whom spoke on the record, and his past public interviews.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter and Facebook were no strangers to chaos and scandal, but even their most challenging times are rivaled by OpenAI's workplace turmoil. There was a failed coup last year, bitter feuds among some workers, and an ongoing existential arms race to build \"digital gods.\"\n\nWeil's peers are certain he's the man to promote harmony. He's spent the better part of 15 years cranking out products that mostly delighted users and made money. He also has something his new employer desperately needs: The ability to pursue the company's best interests and balance human emotions at the same time.\n\nRelated stories\n\nKevin Weil isn't a household name. But for those in the know in Silicon Valley, he's something better: \"He's the get-shit-done guy,\" said James Everingham, who worked with Weil at Instagram and Facebook.\n\nSarah Friar, OpenAI's new head of finance, has long admired Weil's product chops. Former Twitter boss Adam Bain called Weil \"Twitter's secret weapon\" for driving ad revenue. Everingham also described Weil as a workhorse who never shrank from a deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He brings that stamina, that dogged focus on the outcome,\" said April Underwood, a venture capitalist who worked closely with Weil on Twitter's ad products.\n\nWeil's relentless work ethic and people skills are recurring themes among former colleagues. At Facebook, two colleagues said he would often badge into the office first and fire off messages late into the night.\n\nOne colleague from Planet, a satellite imagery company where Weil worked as president until May of 2024, recalled how he started each week by posting in Slack the top three things on his mind. According to Everingham, Weil's a rare breed of product manager who codes almost as well as he writes memos. That endeared Weil to the engineers he needed to build products.\n\nWeil shrugs off the pressures of work with long runs and Diet Mountain Dew. Every birthday, he runs his age in miles and, in June, marked his 41st year with a 41-mile jaunt near his home in the posh California suburb of Portola Valley, according to a public Instagram post. Weil lives with his venture capitalist wife, Elizabeth, and three children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He is a little bit superhuman in just the sheer amount that he works and works out,\" said Ashley Johnson, chief financial officer and now president of Planet.\n\nFormer colleagues say Kevin Weil was key to turning Twitter into a crucial arena for advertisers. Brian Ach/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nWeil set aside a Stanford doctorate in theoretical particle physics to cave out a path in tech, according to a 2017 speech he gave at his alma mater. In 2009, Weil landed at Twitter as a data scientist. At the time, Twitter had little revenue, never mind profit, to show for its many millions of users. That left investors wondering how Twitter would translate its popularity into money.\n\nWhen Twitter began developing ads a year later, Weil stepped up to lead it. Katie Jacobs Stanton, a venture capitalist who overlapped with Weil at Twitter, said employees debated how to show ads in a way that didn't degrade the user experience, pitting engineers against marketers. Weil threaded the needle. Under his oversight, Twitter launched ads that looked like tweets inside the feed. AdAge reported in 2011 that hundreds of brands had embraced the format, helping to establish the cash flow that made Twitter's IPO possible in 2013.\n\nThen, in early 2016, Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom asked Weil to dinner as Snapchat was nipping at the Facebook-owned photo app's heels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstagram needed to get users, especially teens, to post more; Systrom wanted a pinch-hitter to get new features designed and added to the app and into the hands of Instagram users. Weil told CNBC in 2017 that he had already resigned from Twitter with plans to train for a 50-mile ultramarathon snaking the American River in California's Central Valley. He took the Instagram job and, a month later, finished fifth in the race.\n\nThe product leader wasted no time in the photo-sharing battle. In just a few months, Instagram rolled out a feature similar to Snapchat's disappearing photos and videos, then added popular face filters and also introduced a feed-ranking algorithm to highlight more relevant content. According to Instagram, its user base doubled within two years of Weil's arrival, reaching 1 billion monthly users by 2018; Snapchat's earnings statements during the same period indicated that its user growth had flatlined.\n\nEveringham, his former colleague, recounted how when Systrom identified Stories as Instagram's killer feature, Weil assembled a nimble team of engineers under the CEO's supervision to execute it.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"He had this clarity of thinking I haven't seen in anyone else,\" said Everingham, now an engineering leader of developer infrastructure at Meta.\n\nWeil's tenure at Instagram was defined by a controversial strategy: borrowing liberally from the competition. The features that became Instagram staples had their genesis in a rival's playbook, which neither Systrom nor Weil denied in interviews with Vox and TechCrunch over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis strategy is particularly poignant as Weil steps into his new role at OpenAI, a company navigating a thicket of copyright lawsuits. New outlets, authors, and celebrities have sued OpenAI over using their work to train its large language models.\n\nThat's far from the only struggle the product chief faces. He's positioned as one of Altman's top lieutenants at a time when OpenAI's famed brain trust is leaving in droves, often to start competitor companies that may threaten OpenAI's early dominance in the space.\n\nFormer OpenAI employees and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei founded Anthropic, one of OpenAI's most notable competitors, in 2021. Former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever has raised $1 billion for his new venture, Safe Superintelligence. Ex-researcher Aravind Srinivas is working on an AI-powered search engine, Perplexity. In early December, Murati, the former CTO, told Wired she was \"figuring out\" what her new venture would look like, though it's unclear if her startup will directly compete with OpenAI.\n\nMira Murati's move follows a series of high-profile exits from OpenAI this years. Patrick T. Fallon/Getty Images\n\nAnother threat comes from open-source AI models championed by the likes of Meta. If these free-to-use systems prove good enough for most users, it will make it far harder for OpenAI to effectively monetize its AI models and, ultimately, turn a profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause with over $20 billion funding, according to PitchBook data, and only an estimated $3.7 billion in revenue in 2024 plus losses of $5 billion, according to leaked documents obtained by The New York Times in September), OpenAI still faces a long road to prove that it can deliver a return on the unprecedented volumes of capital plowed into the company. And that's without even getting into the growing concern that improvements in AI models are slowing.\n\nOnstage at the Ray Summit in October, Weil shrugged off the threat of competition. When asked about whether the current gap in quality between open-source models and OpenAI's premium AI products will shrink, he quipped: \"I mean, we're certainly going to do our best to make it grow.\"\n\nIn theory, a proven leader like Weil could help guide the operation past the power struggles and talent losses toward a more steady state. By all accounts, he's a deft conciliator who can empathize with the needs and concerns of multiple stakeholders.\n\n\"He's somewhat of a diplomat,\" said Jacobs Stanton, his former Twitter colleague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt Facebook, where Weil helped develop a stablecoin backed by a basket of international currencies, he had to mediate between crypto natives, the product purists who wanted to take a more user-friendly, less decentralized approach, and policymakers, according to two former Facebook colleagues. The project ultimately couldn't overcome regulatory roadblocks and an exodus of corporate partners; Meta shuttered the project in 2022, selling $182 million worth of assets to Silvergate Bank.\n\nKevin Weil leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services OpenAI can sell.

With its several thousand employees, regulators scrutinizing its every move, and 300 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, OpenAI is more complex than any company Weil's stepped into before. In just six months since his arrival, OpenAI has rolled out a large language model that can solve more complex problems via a process the company calls \"reasoning,\" and a search engine within ChatGPT.\n\nAdditionally, OpenAI launched a voice mode to talk to ChatGPT, which Weil personally tested as a \"universal translator\" during recent trips to Seoul and Tokyo. Reflecting on the release, Weil shared on LinkedIn, \"It feels normal to me now, but two years ago I wouldn't have believed it was possible.\"\n\nLast week OpenAI announced an ambitious \"12 days of shipmas,\" a festive product sprint likely to keep Weil working long hours. While he's managed to keep the proverbial plates spinning in his professional life, there's been one noticeable casualty: his workout routine. App data from Strava shows that he's been logging fewer hours of cycling and running each month since he joined OpenAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about Weil's exercise, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said Weil recorded 96 minutes of physical activity a day in November. \"I would say he's doing quite alright,\" Felix said.\n\nMelia Russell is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, covering startups and venture capital.

            "article_content": "4. Energy analysts agree the power grid needs upgrades to add more reliability and resiliency to the power supply. Data is helping the electric power sector generate more complete and accurate models to support better long-term planning to balance electricity supply and demand. Courtesy: Greenlots\n\nPlanning and operating a power system requires detailed grid studies to guide investment decisions and prepare for how the system may evolve over time. Long-term planning can identify the policy, regulatory, infrastructure, and operational updates that may be needed to achieve desired outcomes. Also, comprehensive planning can identify operating limits, determine performance improvements, assess mitigation measures, and characterize potential upgrades to the system. In the past two decades, installed capacity of renewable and distributed energy resources, most of them inverter-based wind and solar power, has increased significantly and is expected to continue accelerating. Traditional power system planning methods and tools are increasingly challenged as the impacts of decarbonization and electrification affect the power system. Models to represent synchronous machines\u2014until recently, most of the generation sources on the system\u2014are developed based on their physical characteristics. System operators increasingly seek methods and software to effectively plan and operate the bulk system with renewable energy resources, many of which may be at the distribution level.\n\nPower System Planning Studies Require New Tools and Methods\n\nIn addition to planning for future demand growth and evolving generation portfolios, system owners and operators must provide transmission services for renewable generation sources that are often remote from load centers and behave significantly different than traditional generation. Bulk power system planners and operators may require new tools and methods to provide a reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective supply of electricity to consumers while accommodating the expected increase in low-carbon resources. Studies used in system planning, typically referred to as transient studies or dynamic studies, focus on the timeframe immediately after an event on the system and simulate how the system will respond. To determine if a system event will lead to instability requires robust, accurate, and comprehensive mathematical models for every device on the network. These models represent both the physical characteristics of a device, as well as the action and behavior of any control system that may be present. This increase in computer-code-based control systems for generation resources creates a number of significant challenges for dynamic studies, including accurately representing these resources, ensuring models capture actual behavior of the assets, and understanding how changes in the computer code may impact device responses. Another key challenge in the studies is the ability to represent intellectual-property-protected computer code. The most accurate results can be obtained when using models provided by an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), since they have visibility into their intellectual property (IP). However, in many cases, power system planning studies are conducted years before an OEM has been identified. Even when the OEM is known, the entity conducting the study may not have the necessary permissions to get access to IP-protected models, especially if a generation resource is located in a neighboring region or competing power system. In such scenarios, the use of generic models that do not represent any particular OEM, but can represent the trend of equipment dynamic responses, can be highly valuable. Generic models of synchronous machines\u2019 control systems are usually standardized models that have been well developed and validated over time. This is not the case for inverter-based resources, loads, high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission, flexible alternate current transmission, and other static devices.\n\nDeveloping Generic Models for Inverter-Based Resources and HVDC\n\nTo close this gap, the team at EPRI has been leading the work in the energy industry to continuously develop, parameterize, apply, and update generic models. Collaborating with OEMs, utilities, system operators, consultants, industry working groups, national labs, and other stakeholders demonstrates the team\u2019s value-driven approach. Several of the EPRI team\u2019s relevant generic models have been approved by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) Model Validation Subcommittee, an industry forum that determines which generic models can be used for specific WECC-wide interconnection studies. Largely, EPRI\u2019s generic modeling efforts have resulted in integration into commercial modeling software tools, such as:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe development, parameterization, and benchmarking of generic WECC models for inverter-based resources (newer technology like grid forming and conventional technology), in both positive sequence and EMT domains.\n\nThe development of the WECC composite load model.\n\nThe development of HVDC generic models.\n\nWhile these models can be useful for understanding general trends in forward-looking studies, the use of generic models should be approached with appropriate cautions regarding applicability and limits. Appropriate parameterization of the models is extremely important, and recognizing the scenarios where these models can be applied and where they cannot is equally relevant. In its work with multiple system operators, transmission owners, and vertically integrated utilities, EPRI research has demonstrated:\n\nImproved numerical robustness of generic models in studies of systems with a high percentage of inverter-based resources, especially to understand general trends of potential instability under different operating conditions.\n\nThe capability of generic grid forming inverter-based resources models and technology in addressing stability issues.\n\nThe parameterization of load models based on survey and measurement data as well as parameterization of loads to replicate grid events.\n\nThe application of HVDC models for offshore wind integration.\n\n\u2014Deepak Ramasubramanian is EPRI Transmission Operations and Planning technical leader.

            "article_content": "Recently, Amazon announced a multi-year partnership with Orbital Materials to use their \u2018proprietary AI platform\u2019 to develop new materials that help decarbonise data centres. Orbital is synthesising, testing and designing advanced materials for data centre-integrated carbon removal and cooling technology.\n\n\u201cTogether, AWS and Orbital will evaluate the scalability and performance of these new technologies in removing carbon and increasing efficiency,\u201d said Amazon in the report.\n\nOrbital, like any other materials science lab using AI, said that the development of new materials has \u2018traditionally been a slow process of trial and error in the lab,\u2019 and generative AI has significantly improved the timeframe for discovering these materials.\n\n\u201cOrbital has achieved a 10x improvement in its material\u2019s performance through the use of its AI platform\u2014an order of magnitude faster than traditional development and breaking new ground in carbon removal efficacy,\u201d the startup announced. The company also plans to deploy and test these carbon removal technologies by the end of 2025.\n\nOrbital\u2019s claims of a \u2018radical\u2019 improvement in the speed of material discovery are also backed by research findings from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), suggesting we\u2019re living in a golden age of material discovery.\n\nThe Golden Age of Materials Science?\n\nRecent research from MIT outlines the potential of AI technologies and their assistance to scientists, specifically those working on materials science. The author revealed statistics after handing over \u2018new materials discovery technology\u2019 to 1018 scientists in an unnamed \u2018R&D lab of a large US firm\u2019.\n\nThe data showed a 44% increase in new material discovery, a 39% increase in patent filings, and a 17% increase in product prototypes that incorporated these newly discovered materials.\n\n\u201cTrained on the composition and characteristics of existing materials, the model generates recipes for novel compounds predicted to possess specified properties,\u201d said Aidan Toner-Rodgers.\n\nInterestingly, the research also revealed that 82% of scientists reported a reduced level of satisfaction with their work, as they found that leveraging AI decreased creativity and skill underutilisation.\n\nThe advent of AI revolutionising materials science began last year, when Google DeepMind released research titled \u2018Scaling deep learning for material discovery\u2019, where they discovered 2.2 million new crystals, equivalent to 800 years of work of knowledge. Out of which, 380,000 materials were stable materials.\n\n\u201cFor example, 52,000 new layered compounds similar to graphene have the potential to revolutionise electronics with the development of superconductors,\u201d said DeepMind in the announcement.\n\nGoogle DeepMind went beyond discovery and also published another research stating that 41 out of 58 selected materials were successfully synthesised in just 17 days.\n\nMeta marked its foray into material size by releasing a massive data set called Open Materials 2024, or OMat24. The dataset contains over 118 million examples of material simulations and structures, focusing on a wide range of inorganic bulk materials to improve AI-enabled material discovery.\n\nNew Materials, Really?\n\nDeep learning has amplified materials research and discovery for a few years now. However, if there\u2019s one way AI can save humanity, it lies in not just discovering new materials, but also finding ways to synthesise and manufacture them in commercial capabilities.\n\nWhen Google Deepmind made the announcement last year, the company did not take long for contradictory results to come into the picture, where a researcher said that many of the materials discovered weren\u2019t truly novel and were just minor variations of known compounds. It also said that Google Deepmind mostly focused on the stability of the materials, overlooking functionalities that are required for practical applications.\n\nMoreover, Google\u2019s claim of synthesising these newly discovered materials using an autonomous lab is also facing scrutiny, thanks to a study from Princeton University. The researchers here outright deny Google Deepmind\u2019s claim. They said that none of the materials produced by the autonomous lab were new and that the majority were misclassified.\n\nThe authors also say that a majority of the synthetic products were wrongly characterised. It failed to distinguish between materials with random and organised atomic arrangements. In short, the authors said that AI can generate predictions but will struggle to interpret experimental results accurately.\n\nWhen Do I Use It\n\nPresuming these challenges are overcome in discovering and synthesising new materials, but when can we hold these new materials?\n\nIt is indeed a very long journey. Benjamin Reinhardt, CEO at Speculative Technologies, puts it best in his work: Getting materials out of the Lab.\n\n\u201cYou can think of lab-scale materials as the most artisanal products in the world, painstakingly handcrafted by people with advanced degrees. Like any artisanal product, lab-scale materials are expensive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTrying to mass-produce these materials by simply increasing the number of fume hoods, test tubes, and pipette wielders would make them cost billions of dollars per kilogram.\u201d\n\nMass-producing or scaling these newly discovered materials remains a challenge. From analysing the materials\u2019 failure modes in controlled conditions to setting up an industrial-scale factory, following regulations, and justifying the choices to investors and customers, one is surely set to turn into Sisyphus.\n\nScientists, mostly working in universities, have strong incentives to focus on novelty and one-off demonstrations because these can lead to publications and positive media attention.\n\n\u201cStart-ups commercialising a new material face many headwinds, including often-unavoidable relationships with larger companies, trade-offs between speed and profit margins, and capital constraints,\u201d said Reinhardt.\n\nMoreover, newly discovered materials need to go through a lot of testing, and the world has seen quite a few tragedies when they\u2019re put out in the real world. For instance, carbon fibre, and composite materials are all the rage. We don\u2019t need to look far behind in the history books. In the recent OceanGate\u2019s tragic implosion, the Titan submersible was using an \u2018experimental carbon fibre composite hull\u2019. It was the first instance of the material being used in a submersible.\n\nAn investigation revealed that the hull may have been prone to micro buckling and delamination under deepsea pressures. Small manufacturing imperfections in carbon-fiber material could amplify such issues.\n\nIn 2017, the Grenfell Tower fire in London, claimed 72 lives owing to the building\u2019s exterior cladding. It was made of aluminium composite panel panels with a polyethylene core and flammable insulation materials. The combination led to a rapid spread of fire, and investigations revealed that manufacturers exploited loopholes in regulation.\n\nTherefore, there will be an increased sense of caution before these materials come to life. In the essay, Reinhardt also provided a dataset that visualises the timeline from when materials were discovered and fully commercialised.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves. The next time it seems exciting when AI has discovered new materials, it\u2019s time to give ourselves a reality check. There\u2019s no doubt AI has the potential to speed up the manufacturing process as well, but we\u2019re yet to see how.\n\n[This story has been read by 530 unique individuals.]\n\n\n\n"

This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nThe meme coin market surged by around $7 billion in the past 24 hours, helping power the Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) presale past $10.3 million.\n\nOnce derided as joke coins, meme coins are the fastest-growing crypto sector, today valued at $146.5 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of $37.7 billion.\n\nAnd some meme coins are more equal than others, which is where the innovative one-of-a-kind Crypto All-Stars and its unified staking systems come in. Nearly $500,000 has poured into $STARS in the past 24 hours.\n\nInvestors have contributed millions of dollars to the platform because of its revolutionary MemeVault, which will enable holders of major meme coins to stash them in the super-convenient passive income-generating facility.\n\nThe days when meme coins were purely for flipping are over, as more and more retail investors choose to hang on to their assets in the expectation that the coins will continue to extend their bullish runs as crypto increasingly opens up to the mainstream.\n\nCrypto All-Stars has introduced the industry\u2019s first unified meme coin staking protocol, providing investors with a way to get on board for one of the next big things in meme coins \u2013 staking to earn a passive income.\n\n$STARS tokens are available for just $0.0016782, but there are only 12 days left to buy before the presale price increases, so time is running out for savvy buyers.\n\nAs bitcoin takes a breather after smashing through the all-important $100,000 price level, its market share has slipped to 54%. As a result, altcoins \u2013 and meme coins in particular \u2013 have been rising in dominance.\n\n\ud83d\udc9c The All-Star Dominance Continues! \ud83d\udc9c\n\n\n\nThese All-Stars are 8 digits of fun now! 10 Million is a massive number!\n\n\n\nThank you! We'll see YOU in the MemeVault \ud83d\ude09 pic.twitter.com/T2TkUCPuxG \u2014 Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 7, 2024\n\nMeme Coins Lead A New Financial Information Ecosystem And Staking Multiple Meme Coins On $STARS Incentivizes Hodlers\n\nCoverage of meme coins has spread to investment journals of record such as the Financial Times, where their ability to create and monetize communities based on social media virality is attracting attention.\n\nFor sure, meme coins are hyper-speculative even by crypto standards, but if you pick right you can bag eye-watering gains that make you the envy of stock traders.\n\nWhile so-called \u2018Dino coins\u2019 like XRP, TRON and ADA are some of the early beneficiaries of altcoin season, it is meme coins like $CHILLGUY and $PNUT that have been turning heads. They are the latest of the meme coin breed and are at the forefront of how the \u201cinformation ecosystem is changing in finance\u201d, as Gillian Tett puts in that Financial Times article referenced above.\n\nThe story of a euthanized squirrel in New York, culled to prevent the spread of rabies, went viral on social media, attracting the attention of Elon Musk \u2013 led to the creation of the Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) token.\n\nSince launching in early November PNUT has soared to a market cap of $1.4 billion, priced at $1.43, up 2573% since being tracked by CoinMarketCap but much more than that if you bought it on the Solana no-code launchpad pump.fun.\n\nWith so many new, and old, meme coin token holders out there who will be hodling, the market timing of Crypto All-Stars could not have been better.\n\nCrypto All-Stars Might Be The Next $1 Billion Meme Coin: Here\u2019s Why\n\nCrypto All-Stars has the same potential as PNUT to achieve a $1 billion market cap because MemeVault is the sort of innovation that can ride the wave of meme coin expansion by providing a much-needed service for market participants.\n\nCertainly it is a staking platform and in that sense will be familiar to many in crypto. But it\u2019s much more than just that. MemeVault will enable its users to bring together top meme coins in one place where they can be staked in a single unified protocol.\n\nThe aim is simple: eradicate the complexity of managing multiple staking platforms. Crypto All-Stars\u2019 MemeVault makes it easier for users to earn rewards by staking everything in one place in a streamlined system. Tim is money, and with MemeVault token holders will save time and maximize their returns.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, staking returns can be amplified by simply holding the platform\u2019s native token $STARS. The more $STARS tokens you hold, the greater your staking rewards.\n\nBy utilizing $STARS, staking returns can be as much as tripled. Thus, MemeVault makes staking easier and magnifies potential returns.\n\nNever mind the $1 billion market cap \u2013 $STARS could be headed way beyond that valuation, such is the size of its addressable market.\n\nCrypto Media Is Buzzing About Crypto All-Stars\n\nIt cannot be restated enough that Crypto All-Stars is the only project offering this financial service, and that\u2019s why word has been spreading fast in crypto media.\n\nCointelegraph, Bitcoin.com, CryptoPotato, ReadWrite, and Brave New Coin, are just some of the media outlets that have been picking up on the opportunity presented by Crypto All-Stars.\n\nThe Crypto Gains YouTube channel with 139,000 subscribers urges viewers to get in early before the coin launches:\n\nMight Crypto All-Stars List On Binance Or Coinbase When its Massive Fundraising Finishes In 12 Days?\n\nAs the presale approaches the finish line, due in 12 days\u2019 time, $STARS is set for an exchange listing that will open the door to a broader investor base and increased liquidity, potentially driving its price even higher.\n\nThe $STARS team has not disclosed the name of the first centralized exchange, but the success of Crypto All-Stars\u2019 ICO is likely to attract the attention of top-tier exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase or even Robinhood.\n\nA Binance listing for $STARS could see it follow in the footsteps of meme coins like Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT), First Neiro on Ethereum ($NEIRO), PopCat ($POPCAT) and Moo Deng ($MOODENG) in serving up life-changing returns \u2013 $NEIRO rocketed 7,594.18%, helped in large part by its Binance listing.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling where the fundraising will end up. At this rate, it could surpass $15 million, which would place it among the largest meme coin presales of the year.\n\nTime To Buy $STARS Is Running Out \u2013 How To Buy And Stake\n\nTo buy $STARS, go to the Crypto All-Stars website, connect your wallet (Best Wallet is a good choice), and swap ETH, USDT, or BNB for $STARS. Bank cards are also accepted as a payment method.\n\nIn line with its meme coin mission, the site\u2019s exchange widget allows users to buy $ STARS tokens using popular meme coins like $FLOKI, $SHIB, $DOGE, and $PEPE.\n\nNewly bought $STARS can also be immediately staked to earn a yield of 226% APY, giving new investors an opportunity to grow their holdings before the launch of MemeVault. To be clear, the staking system available now is different from the unified staking MemeVault that will roll out later.\n\nCrypto All-Stars\u2019 smart contract has been audited by top security firms SolidProof and Coinsult, and passed with flying colors, so investors can rest assured on security matters.\n\nKeep in touch with developments and news from Crypto All-Stars by joining the community on Telegram (5k members) and X (19k followers).\n\nCrypto All-Stars is at the forefront of the new wave of meme coin investing and has no competitors for its unified staking system.

            "article_content": "You know that moment when you open an app and everything just \u2018clicks\u2019? The colours are inviting, navigation and button placement feel instinctive, and executing what you have in mind isn\u2019t jarring or inconvenient\u2014almost as if the app knows you better than you know yourself.\n\nThen there\u2019s the flip side. Apps that feel like a maze designed by a mischievous gremlin, leaving you frustrated and reaching for the uninstall button faster than one can even say the word \u2018engagement\u2019.\n\nUser interface (UI) and user experience (UX) have transcended from mere tech jargon to the heartbeat of any successful app\u2014more so in the retail space. As we\u2019re seeing newer apps surface faster than social media trends going viral, the imperative for keeping your UI/UX feel fresh and intuitive has never been greater.\n\nHowever, why do these tiny tweaks matter? How can one achieve this amidst the uphill battle in the background without breaking a sweat (or the app)?\n\nWhy do little tweaks pack a big punch?\n\nReports highlight that a staggering 50% of users uninstall an app within just 30 days of downloading, with nearly 25% abandoning it after just one use. In that fleeting moment, the UI/UX does all the talking. An intuitive, visually appealing, and welcoming layout can make a difference between a user diving deeper or tapping out.\n\nSmall UI/UX enhancements\u2014like simplifying the checkout process, optimising load times, or making call-to-action buttons more prominent\u2014can lead to improvements in user engagement and conversion rates.\n\nThis is more so during the festive season when user activity sees a spike alongside competition. Retail and ecommerce apps roll out special offers, flash sales, and user interfaces donning the festive spirit.\n\nHowever, if an app\u2019s UI is clunky or counterintuitive, users will uninstall the app faster than Santa climbs down a chimney. According to a report, about 70% of online businesses fail due to poor usability of their apps and websites. Poor UX can be devastating\u2014customer churn, negative reviews, and a tarnished brand reputation.\n\nAlso Read How AI-based customer service is enhancing user experience\n\nThe struggle behind the scenes\n\nKeeping the UI/UX fresh and intuitive is paramount. However, ensuring this poses significant challenges for product managers and marketers alike.\n\nFrequent UI/UX changes demand a lot of creativity, time, and collaboration, and more so when dealing with global user bases with varying cultural preferences. Besides, the process can often be time-consuming. About 50% of marketers say it takes over four weeks to modify app and web experiences.\n\nDependency on developer teams and the arduous internal processes restrict the ability for quick implementation of updates, creating bottlenecks and further limiting responsiveness to user feedback. Nearly 24% of marketers find it impossible to experiment with variations due to technical or resource constraints.\n\nMoreover, 54% of product managers are unable to support marketers in experimenting with onboarding flows, content, and layout adjustments due to resource limitations. This reliance on developer teams adds to the complexities for marketers and product managers, resulting in potential delays in delivering timely, engaging experiences.\n\nImproving product experiences with no-code solutions\n\nMeeting the demand for instant UI/UX adjustments without a full-scale overhaul may seem impossible. However, advanced no-code and low-code solutions provide a seamless way for teams to enhance product experiences and easily manage frequent app updates.\n\nIn fact, 81% of marketers and 72% of product managers agree that no-code frameworks could empower their teams and facilitate faster and more frequent experimentation.\n\nMarketing automation platforms with no-code personalisation features and dynamic UI/UX adjustments can enable product managers to instantly tailor experiences for different user segments, minimising the strain on the developers.\n\nBy unlocking faster implementation and reducing the dependency on engineering, such tools can help marketers and product teams push out relevant updates without compromising on quality\u2014empowering them to remain agile and responsive to market needs and ensuring the app is always fresh for users throughout the year.\n\nToday, as technology and user expectations continue to soar higher, standing still is not very different from moving backwards. Agile UI/UX isn\u2019t just about keeping up with the trends but setting them.\n\nPrioritising UI/UX with low-code and no-code solutions shows users the brand listens, adapts, and values quality product experiences\u2014building loyalty and engagement more easily than ever.\n\nAnand Jain is the Co-founder and Chief Product Officer at CleverTap."

            "article_content": "To many, AI is just a horrible Steven Spielberg movie. To others, it's the next generation of learning computers. But what is artificial intelligence, exactly? The answer depends on who you ask. Broadly, artificial intelligence (AI) is the combination of computer science and robust datasets, deployed to solve some kind of problem.\n\nMany definitions of artificial intelligence include a comparison to the human mind or brain, whether in form or function. Alan Turing wrote in 1950 about \u201cthinking machines\u201d that could respond to a problem using human-like reasoning. His eponymous Turing test is still a benchmark for natural language processing. Later, Stuart Russell and John Norvig observed that humans are intelligent, but we're not always rational. Russell and Norvig saw two classes of artificial intelligence: systems that think and act like a human being, versus those that think and act rationally. Today, we've got all kinds of programs we call AI.\n\n'AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable'\n\nMany AIs employ \"neural nets,\" whose code is written to emulate some aspect of the architecture of neurons or the brain. However, not all intelligence is human-like. Nor is it necessarily the best idea to emulate neurobiological information processing. That's why engineers limit how far they carry the brain metaphor. It's more about how phenomenally parallel the brain is, and its distributed memory handling. As defined by John McCarthy in 2004, artificial intelligence is \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, the distinction between a neural net and an AI is often a matter of philosophy, more than capabilities or design. Many \"AI-powered\" systems are neural nets, under the hood. We also call some neural nets AIs. For example, OpenAI's powerful GPT-3 AI is a type of neural net called a transformer (more on these below). A robust neural net's performance can equal or outclass a narrow AI. There is much overlap between neural nets and artificial intelligence, but the capacity for machine learning can be the dividing line.\n\nWhat is an AI Made Of?\n\nConceptually: In the sense of its logical structure, to be an AI, you need three fundamental parts. First, there's the decision process -- usually an equation, a model, or just some code. AIs often perform classification or apply transformations. To do that, the AI must be able to decide on patterns in the data. Second, there's an error function -- some way for the AI to check its work. And third, if the AI is going to learn from experience, it needs some way to optimize its model. Many neural networks do this with a system of weighted nodes, where each node has both a value and a relationship to its network neighbors. Values change over time; stronger relationships have a higher weight in the error function.\n\nDeep learning\n\nDeep learning networks have more hidden layers than conventional neural networks. Circles are nodes, or \"neurons.\"Physically: Typically, an AI is \"just\" software. AI-powered software services like Grammarly and Rytr use neural nets, like GPT-3. Those neural nets consist of equations or commands, written in things like Python or Common Lisp. They run comparisons, perform transformations, and suss out patterns from the data. They run on server-side hardware, usually, but which hardware isn't important. Any conventional silicon will do, be it CPU or GPU. However, there are dedicated hardware neural nets, a special kind of ASIC called neuromorphic chips.\n\nTensors and Neuromorphic Silicon\n\nNot all ASICs are neuromorphic designs. However, neuromorphic chips are all ASICs. Neuromorphic design is fundamentally different from CPUs, and only nominally overlaps with a GPU's multi-core architecture. But it's not some exotic new transistor type, nor any strange and eldritch kind of data structure. It's all about tensors. Tensors describe the relationships between things; they're a kind of mathematical object that can have metadata, just like a digital photo has EXIF data.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nModern Nvidia RTX GPUs have a huge number of tensor cores. That makes sense if you're drawing moving polygons, each with some number of properties or effects that apply to it. But tensors can handle more than just spatial data. The ability to parallelize tensor calculations is also why GPUs get scalped for crypto mining, and why they're used in cluster computing, especially for deep learning. GPUs excel at organizing many different threads at once.\n\nBut no matter how elegant your data organization might be, it still has to filter through multiple layers of software abstraction before it ever becomes binary. Intel's neuromorphic chip, Loihi 2, affords a very different approach.\n\nLoihi 2\n\nLoihi 2 is a neuromorphic chip that comes as a package deal with a software ecosystem named Lava. Loihi's physical architecture invites -- almost requires -- the use of weighting and an error function, both defining features of AI and neural nets. The chip's biomimetic design extends to its electrical signaling. Instead of ones and zeroes, on or off, Loihi \"fires\" in spikes with an integer value -- capable of carrying much more data. It begs to be used with tensors. What if you didn't have to translate your values into machine code and then binary? What if you could just encode them directly?\n\nMachine learning models that use Lava can take full advantage of Loihi 2's unique physical design. Together, they offer a hybrid hardware-software neural net that can process relationships between multiple entire multi-dimensional datasets, like an acrobat spinning plates.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAI tools like Rytr, Grammarly and others do their work in a regular desktop browser. In contrast, neuromorphic chips like Loihi aren't designed for use in consumer systems. (At least, not yet.) They're intended for researchers. Instead, neuromorphic engineering has a different strength. It can allow silicon to perform another kind of biomimicry. Brains are extremely cheap, in terms of power use per unit throughput. The hope is that Loihi and other neuromorphic systems can mimic that power efficiency to break out of the Iron Triangle and deliver all three: good, fast, and cheap.\n\nAI vs. Neural Nets vs. Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning\n\nIf the three-part logical structure of an AI sounds familiar, that's because neural nets have the same three logical pillars. In fact, from IBM's perspective, the relationship between machine learning, deep learning, neural networks and artificial intelligence is a hierarchy of evolution. It's just like the relationship between Charmander, Charmeleon and Charizard. They're all separate entities in their own right, but each is based on the one before, and they grow in power as they evolve. We still have Charmanders even though we also have Charizards.\n\n\" achine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, and neural networks make up the backbone of deep learning algorithms. In fact, it is the number of node layers, or depth, of neural networks that distinguishes a single neural network from a deep learning algorithm, which must have more than three.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence as it relates to machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. Image: IBM An AI isn't just several neural nets smashed together, any more than Charizard is three Charmanders in a trench coat. All these different types of artificial intelligence overlap along a spectrum of complexity. It can be difficult to precisely draw the line. But what often distinguishes an AI from a neural net is the ability to learn. IBM explains, \"[M]achine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, and neural networks make up the backbone of deep learning algorithms. In fact, it is the number of node layers, or depth, of neural networks that distinguishes a single neural network from a deep learning algorithm, which must have more than three [layers].\"\n\nHow Does an Artificial Intelligence Learn?\n\nWhen an AI learns, it's different than just saving a file after making edits. To an AI, learning involves changing its process.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany neural nets learn through a process called \"back-propagation.\" Typically, a neural net is a \"feed-forward\" process, because data only moves in one direction through the network. It's efficient, but it's also a kind of ballistic (unguided) process. In back-propagation, however, later nodes in the process get to pass information back to earlier nodes. Not all neural nets perform back-propagation, but for those that do, the effect is like changing the coefficients in front of the variables in an equation.\n\nSupervised and Unsupervised Learning\n\nWe also divide neural nets into two classes, depending on what type of problems they can solve. In supervised learning, a neural net checks its work against a labeled training set or an overwatch; in most cases, that overwatch is a human. For example, SwiftKey learns how you text, and adjusts its autocorrect to match. Pandora uses listeners' input to finely classify music, in order to build specifically tailored playlists. 3blue1brown even has an excellent explainer series on neural nets, where he discusses a neural net using supervised learning to perform handwriting recognition.\n\nSupervised learning is great for fine accuracy on an unchanging set of parameters, like alphabets. Unsupervised learning, however, can wrangle data with changing numbers of dimensions. (An equation with x, y and z terms is a three-dimensional equation.) Unsupervised learning tends to win with small datasets. It's also good at recognizing patterns we might not even know to look for.\n\nTensors and Transformers\n\nTransformers are a special, versatile kind of AI capable of unsupervised learning. They can integrate many different streams of data, each with its own changing parameters. Because of this, they're great at handling tensors. Tensors, in turn, are great for keeping all that data organized. With the combined powers of tensors and transformers, we can handle more complex datasets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nVideo upscaling and motion smoothing are great applications for AI transformers. Likewise, tensors are crucial to the detection of deepfakes and alterations. With deepfake tools reproducing in the wild, it's a digital arms race.\n\nThe person in this image does not exist. This is a deepfake image created by StyleGAN, Nvidia's generative adversarial neural network. Video signal has high dimensionality. It's made of a series of images, which are themselves composed of a series of coordinates and color values. Mathematically and in computer code, we represent those quantities as matrices or n-dimensional arrays. Helpfully, tensors are great for matrix and array wrangling. DaVinci Resolve, for example, uses tensor processing in its (NVidia RTX) hardware-accelerated Neural Engine facial recognition utility. Hand those tensors to a transformer, and its powers of unsupervised learning do a great job picking out the curves of motion on-screen -- and in real life.\n\nTensor, Transformer, Servo, Spy\n\nIn fact, that ability to track multiple curves against one another is why the tensor-transformer dream team has taken so well to things like natural language processing. And the approach can generalize. Convolutional transformers -- a hybrid of a CNN and a transformer -- excel at image recognition on the fly. This tech is in use today, for things like robot search and rescue or assistive image and text recognition, as well as the much more controversial practice of dragnet facial recognition, \u00e0 la Hong Kong.\n\nThe ability to handle a changing mass of data is great for consumer and assistive tech, but it's also clutch for things like mapping the genome, and improving drug design. The list goes on. Transformers can also handle different kinds of \"dimensions,\" not just the spatial, which is useful for managing an array of devices or embedded sensors -- like weather tracking, traffic routing, or industrial control systems. That's what makes AI so useful for data processing \"at the edge.\"\n\nAI On the Edge vs. For the Edge\n\nNot only does everyone have a cell phone, there are embedded systems in everything. This proliferation of devices gives rise to an ad hoc global network called the Internet of Things (IoT). In the parlance of embedded systems, the \"edge\" represents the outermost fringe of end nodes within the collective IoT network. Edge intelligence takes two main forms: AI on edge and AI for edge. The distinction is where the processing happens. \"AI on edge\" refers to network end nodes (everything from consumer devices to cars and industrial control systems) that employ AI to crunch data locally. \"AI for the edge\" enables edge intelligence by offloading some of the compute demand to the cloud.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn practice, the main differences between the two are latency and horsepower. Local processing is always going to be faster than a data pipeline beholden to ping times. The tradeoff is the computing power available server-side.\n\nEmbedded systems, consumer devices, industrial control systems, and other end nodes in the IoT all add up to a monumental volume of information that needs processing. Some phone home, some have to process data in near real-time, and some have to check and correct their own work on the fly. Operating in the wild, these physical systems act just like the nodes in a neural net. Their collective throughput is so complex that in a sense, the IoT has become the AIoT -- the artificial intelligence of things.\n\nNone of Us Is As Dumb As All of Us\n\nAs devices get cheaper, even the tiny slips of silicon that run low-end embedded systems have surprising computing power. But having a computer in a thing doesn't necessarily make it smarter. Everything's got Wi-Fi or Bluetooth now. Some of it is really cool. Some of it is made of bees. If I forget to leave the door open on my front-loading washing machine, I can tell it to run a cleaning cycle from my phone. But the IoT is already a well-known security nightmare. Parasitic global botnets exist that live in consumer routers. Hardware failures can cascade, like the Great Northeast Blackout of summer 2003, or when Texas froze solid in 2021. We also live in a timeline where a faulty firmware update can brick your shoes.\n\nThere's a common pipeline (hypeline?) in tech innovation. When some Silicon Valley startup invents a widget, it goes from idea to hype train to widgets-as-a-service to disappointment, before finally figuring out what the widget's actually good for.\n\nThe Gartner hype curve. Artificial intelligence shows up on this roller coaster several times. But we're already getting sick of the IoT. Who knew?\n\nOh, okay, there This is why we lampoon the IoT with loving names like the Internet of Shitty Things and the Internet of Stings. (Internet of Stings devices communicate over TCBee-IP.) But the AIoT isn't something anyone can sell. It's more than the sum of its parts. The AIoT is a set of emergent properties that we have to manage if we're going to avoid an explosion of splinternets, and keep the world operating in real time.\n\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence? TL;DR\n\nIn practice, artificial intelligence is often the same thing as a neural net capable of machine learning. They're both software that can run on whatever CPU or GPU is available and powerful enough. Neural nets often have the power to perform machine learning via back-propagation. There's also a kind of hybrid hardware-and-software neural net that brings a new meaning to \"machine learning.\" It's made using tensors, ASICs, and neuromorphic engineering by Intel. Furthermore, the emergent collective intelligence of the IoT has created a demand for AI on, and for, the edge. Hopefully we can do it justice.\n\nNow Read:"

            "article_content": "The fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government on Sunday brought to a dramatic close his nearly 14-year struggle to hold onto power as his country was torn apart by a devastating civil war that became a proxy battleground for regional and international forces.\n\nAssad\u2019s downfall came as a stark contrast to his first months as Syria\u2019s unlikely president in 2000, when many hoped he would be a young reformer after three decades of his father\u2019s iron grip.\n\nOnly 34 years old, the Western-educated ophthalmologist was a rather geeky tech-savvy fan of computers with a gentle demeanor.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, when protests against his rule broke out in March 2011, Assad resorted to the harsh tactics once used by his father to try and suppress them.\n\nAs the uprising escalated into a full-blown civil war, he relied on his military to bombard opposition-controlled cities, backed by allies Iran and Russia.\n\nInternational human rights groups and prosecutors accused Syria\u2019s government-run detention centres of widespread torture and extrajudicial killings.\n\nFILE - President-elect Lt.

Bashar al Assad, right, attends military training games with Ali Aslan, Chief of Staff of the Syrian army, July 12, 2000, in Syria. - SANA via AP, File\n\nThe Syrian war has claimed nearly 500,000 lives and forced half of the country\u2019s pre-war population of 23 million to flee their homes. As the uprising escalated into a civil war, millions of Syrians sought refuge in neighbouring countries like Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, and Lebanon, with many continuing their journey to Europe.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis departure brings an end to the Assad family rule, spanning just under 54 years. With no clear successor, it throws the country into further uncertainty.\n\nUntil recently, it seemed Assad was close to stabilising his position. The prolonged war had settled into frozen frontlines, with Assad\u2019s government reclaiming most of Syria\u2019s territory. Meanwhile, opposition groups controlled the northwest, and Kurdish forces held the northeast.\n\nDespite crippling Western sanctions on Damascus, neighbouring countries had started to accept Assad\u2019s grip on power.\n\nThe Arab League restored Syria\u2019s membership last year, and in May, Saudi Arabia appointed its first ambassador to Syria in 12 years after cutting ties with Damascus.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the geopolitical situation changed rapidly when opposition groups based in northwest Syria launched a surprise offensive in late November.\n\nGovernment forces quickly crumbled, while Assad\u2019s allies, distracted by other conflicts \u2014 including Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the ongoing wars involving Israel and the Iran-backed militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas \u2014 seemed unwilling to intervene forcefully.\n\nAssad's whereabouts were not clear Sunday, amid reports he had left the country as insurgents took control of the Syrian capital.\n\nFILE - Syrian President Bashar Assad, left, gestures while speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin during their meeting in Damascus, Syria, Jan. 7, 2020. - Alexei Druzhinin, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP, File\n\nBashar came to power in 2000 by a twist of fate. His father had been cultivating his oldest brother Basil as his successor, but in 1994 Basil was killed in a car crash in Damascus. Bashar was brought home from his ophthalmology practice in London, put through military training and elevated to the rank of colonel to establish his credentials so he could one day rule.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Hafez Assad died in 2000, parliament quickly lowered the presidential age requirement from 40 to 34. Bashar\u2019s elevation was sealed by a nationwide referendum, in which he was the only candidate.\n\nHafez, a lifelong military man, ruled the country for nearly 30 years during which he set up a Soviet-style centralized economy and kept such a stifling hand over dissent that Syrians feared even to joke about politics to their friends.\n\nHe pursued a secular ideology that sought to bury sectarian differences under Arab nationalism and the image of heroic resistance to Israel. He formed an alliance with the Shiite clerical leadership in Iran, sealed Syrian domination over Lebanon and set up a network of Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups.\n\nBashar initially seemed completely unlike his strongman father.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTall and lanky with a slight lisp, he had a quiet, gentle demeanour. His only official position before becoming president was head of the Syrian Computer Society. His wife, Asma al-Akhras, whom he married several months after taking office, was attractive, stylish and British-born.\n\nFILE - In this July, 13, 2010 file photo, Syrian President Bashar Assad, left, and his wife Asma Assad, listen to explanations as they visit a technology plant in Tunis, Tunis - Hassene Dridi/AP2010\n\nThe young couple, who eventually had three children, seemed to shun trappings of power. They lived in an apartment in the upscale Abu Rummaneh district of Damascus, as opposed to a palatial mansion like other Arab leaders.\n\nWhen Assad first came to office, he freed political prisoners and allowed more open discussion. During the \"Damascus Spring,\" salons for intellectuals emerged, where Syrians could talk about art, culture, and politics in a way that had been impossible under his father.\n\nBut after 1,000 intellectuals signed a public petition in 2001 calling for multiparty democracy and greater freedoms, and others attempted to form a political party, the salons were shut down by the feared secret police, who arrested dozens of activists.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nInstead of a political opening, Assad turned to economic reforms. He slowly lifted economic restrictions, let in foreign banks, threw the doors open to imports and empowered the private sector. Damascus and other cities long mired in drabness saw a flourishing of shopping malls, new restaurants and consumer goods. Tourism swelled.\n\nAbroad, he stuck to the line his father had set, based on the alliance with Iran and a policy of insisting on a full return of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, although in practice Assad never militarily confronted Israel.\n\nRelated\n\nIn 2005, he suffered a heavy blow with the loss of Syria\u2019s decades-old control over neighbouring Lebanon after the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri. With many Lebanese accusing Damascus of being behind the slaying, Syria was forced to withdraw its troops from the country and a pro-American government came into power.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt the same time, the Arab world became split into two camps - one of US-allied, Sunni-led countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, the other Syria and Shiite-led Iran with their ties to Hezbollah and Palestinian militants.\n\nThroughout, Assad relied largely on the same power base at home as his father: his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam comprising around 10 per cent of the population. Many of the positions in his government went to younger generations of the same families that had worked for his father. Drawn in as well were the new middle class created by his reforms, including prominent Sunni merchant families.\n\nAssad also turned to his own family. His younger brother Maher headed the elite Presidential Guard and would lead the crackdown against the uprising. Their sister Bushra was a strong voice in his inner circle, along with her husband Deputy Defense Minister Assef Shawkat, until he was killed in a 2012 bombing. Bashar\u2019s cousin, Rami Makhlouf, became the country\u2019s biggest businessman, heading a financial empire before the two had a falling out that led to Makhlouf being pushed aside.\n\nFILE PHOTO - Syrian President Bashar Assad, second left, and his wife Asma, center, and their children - Syrian Presidency Facebook page via AP\n\nAssad also increasingly entrusted key roles to his wife, Asma, before she announced in May that she was undergoing treatment for leukaemia and stepped out of the limelight.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen protests erupted in Tunisia and Egypt, eventually toppling their rulers, Assad dismissed the possibility of the same occurring in his country, insisting his regime was more in tune with its people. After the Arab Spring wave did move to Syria, his security forces staged a brutal crackdown while Assad consistently denied he was facing a popular revolt, instead blaming \u201cforeign-backed terrorists\u201d for trying to destabilise his regime.\n\nHis rhetoric struck a chord with many in Syria\u2019s minority groups - including Christians, Druze and Shiites - as well as some Sunnis who feared the prospect of rule by Sunni extremists even more than they disliked Assad\u2019s authoritarian rule.\n\nIronically, on 26 February 2011 \u2014 two days after Egypt's Hosni Mubarak was ousted by protesters and just before the wave of Arab Spring protests reached Syria \u2014 Assad emailed a joke mocking Mubarak\u2019s stubborn refusal to step down. The joke was later revealed by Wikileaks as part of a 2012 document release.\n\n\"NEW WORD ADDED TO DICTIONARY: Mubarak (verb): To stick something, or to glue something. ...

            "article_content": "Looking for reliable income in the stock market? You might want to consider the top Dogs of the Dow in December. Here's what you need to know about this trio of blue-chip stocks.\n\nIt's time to take a look at the \"Dogs of the Dow.\" Are the highest-yielding stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI -0.28%) index undervalued, fantastic buys -- or did their prices fall and dividend yields soar for scary reasons?\n\nStock Dividend Yield Year-to-Date Total Return Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E) Average among the 30 Dow stocks 1.4% 38% 35.0 Verizon Communications (VZ -0.42%) 6.3% 20% 18.4 Chevron (CVX -2.57%) 4.1% 11% 17.4 Amgen (AMGN -0.64%) 3.3% (0%) 35.5\n\nHow last year's Dogs are faring in 2024\n\nAll three of these names were among the 10 highest-yielding Dow stocks at the start of 2024, though only Verizon parked in the top 3 at the time.\n\nOnly two of last year's Dogs of the Dow have outperformed the index itself in 2024. Walgreen Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) was the highest-yielding Dow stock in January. The pharmacy and convenience store conglomerate has fallen 66% since then and has lost its seat at the Dow Industrials table.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Dow has recently become less dividend-focused. The list of index components didn't change from August 2020 to February 2024, but three new names joined the list in the last 10 months. The highest dividend yield in the group of newcomers is 0.7% for paint store giant Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW). The softest dividend from the now-former Dow members was Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) 1.5% yield -- now entirely paused.\n\nUsing the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEMKT: DIA) as a proxy for the Dow, the index's dividend yield fell from 1.8% to 1.4% year to date.\n\nThese recent trends look unfavorable for the Dogs of the Dow strategy. Can the top three yielders on today's list turn the tables in 2025?\n\nVerizon is all about the dividend\n\nVerizon always pays generous dividends, as do most of the leading names in large-scale telecommunications. With modest revenue growth, massive hardware installation and maintenance costs, and $150 billion of long-term debt, it's no surprise to see Verizon share lots of surplus cash profits with its shareholders. Beefy dividends quickly become the main investor attraction as telecom giants mature.\n\nThe lion's share of Verizon's recent returns were indeed generated by the dividend payouts. The stock's total return of 20% in 2024 shrinks to 13% if you only look at price gains.\n\nI often think of Verizon (and similar stocks) as an alternative to savings accounts or certificates of deposit. If you're looking for robust cash payouts and don't plan to sell the stock any time soon, you can shrug off Verizon's weak stock market performance. From that perspective, hypermature cash machines with slow stock charts might be just what an income-seeking investor needs.\n\nHowever, I don't expect market-beating returns from Verizon in 2025. If you care about the stock price, it's probably better to leave Big Red alone and find better investment ideas elsewhere.\n\nChevron is another pure income play\n\nEnergy giant Chevron is a surprisingly similar story.\n\nChevron's top-line sales are down 2% in 2024, and operating cash flow is 1.7% lower. But the dividend budget is up by 5% over the same period, and Chevron still had enough cash flow to reduce its share count by 3.7% via buybacks.\n\nLike Verizon, Chevron is saddled with a huge burden of legacy business operations and an overwhelming need to try new ideas. In the energy sector, that means researching renewable energy sources, even if that effort undermines the company's core competency of producing and distributing fossil fuels.\n\nAlso like Verizon, I would consider buying Chevron stock only if I craved generous dividend payouts above all else. This stock's 11% returns would drop to 6% without the dividend boost.\n\nAmgen looks risky, even at a discount\n\nCan the biotech industry tell a happier tale? I'm not so sure.\n\nDrug developer Amgen has lagged behind the broader market this year, with a sharp drop in November. And that plunge was inspired by some unfortunate news. Leaked data from an important drug trial showed poor results, raising questions about the obesity treatment's approval prospects and about the transparency of Amgen's data reports.\n\nThis is not my wheelhouse, and some of my fellow Fools with deeper expertise in the healthcare market see Amgen's crash as a buying opportunity. Still, I find the company's haphazard data reports troublesome. Is Amgen hiding other weak trial results in hidden spreadsheet tabs, or was this error an honest mistake?\n\nI don't know, and would prefer to find out from the sidelines. Even the largest and most solid names in this sector can be incredibly volatile, and drug development projects can't be slam-dunk wins until very late in the process.\n\nAmgen might be a buy if you have a rock-solid understanding of the science behind the headlines. Most investors are probably better off leaving this unpredictable Dow Dog alone despite a temptingly low stock price."

During an interview in November, Panaro told Schwab Network that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could hit $800 per share by 2030 due to its leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators. That forecast implies about 450% upside from its current share price of $145.\n\nOf course, Nvidia has been one of the hottest stocks on the market. Its share price has surged over 900% since the late-2022 launch of ChatGPT led to an exponential increase in demand for AI infrastructure. The company conducted a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this year to compensate for that price appreciation, and another split may be in the cards if Panaro is correct.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nNvidia has a durable competitive advantage in a quickly growing market\n\nNvidia holds 98% market share in data center graphics processing units (GPUs), chips used to accelerate complex data center workloads, such as training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence applications. One reason for that dominance is superior chip performance. Nvidia regularly achieves the highest scores at the MLPerfs, objective tests that benchmark the capabilities of AI systems.\n\nBut there is another reason Nvidia accounts for virtually all data center GPU sales: It spent the better part of the last two decades building an expansive software ecosystem. In 2006, Nvidia introduced its CUDA programming model, a platform that now spans hundreds of code libraries and pretrained models that streamline AI application development across use cases ranging from autonomous cars and robots to conversational agents and drug discovery.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has branched into other hardware verticals, like central processing units (CPUs) and networking gear. Indeed, Nvidia has a leadership position in InfiniBand networking, currently the most popular connectivity technology for back-end AI networks. The ability to integrate hardware components into a cohesive computing system lets Nvidia build data centers with the lowest total cost of ownership, according to CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nHere is the big picture: Competing with Nvidia is exceedingly difficult. Its GPUs are not only the fastest AI accelerators on the market but are also supported by the most robust software development platform. And Nvidia has another key advantage in vertical integration. Consequently, while it has more pricing power than its peers, Nvidia systems are less expensive when accounting for direct and indirect costs.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "A PC builder has created a 3D printed mini gaming PC build that is literally handheld, thanks to a handle built into the case. It\u2019s also beautifully small, with a volume of just 6.4 liters, while still managing to fit an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU into the chassis.\n\nWith such a small case, fitting top-spec components into the confines could be tricky. The best gaming PCs you can buy are power-hungry monsters, burning through electricity and heating up the air as they do so. Thanks to some clever design decisions, however, this AMD powered gaming PC, with an Nvidia GeForce GPU, manages to house some high-end components that stay both cool and quiet under heavy loads.\n\nThis particular PC build comes courtesy of a post in the r/sffpc subreddit, and it immediately caught my eye. Let\u2019s start with the elephant in the room\u2014this isn\u2019t a PC case that any major manufacturer is offering, but a custom-made, 3D-printed design by Jakob_K_Design, the original Reddit user who shared the build.\n\nJakob has built an impressively small gaming PC for traveling that, thanks to the case\u2019s built-in handle, he can just grab and take with him, anywhere he goes. A clever case is one thing, but the specs behind this build aren\u2019t to be sniffed at, either. Jakob has managed to fit a smaller-sized Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4070 Windforce 2X graphics card with two cooling fans into the case to provide some hefty gaming power.\n\nThe CPU, meanwhile, is an AMD 5 Ryzen 8400F, which admittedly isn\u2019t the best gaming CPU you can buy. However, this is a decision that Jakob says is \u201ctemporary\u201d before he switches it out for a 7900 from his current PC. He doesn\u2019t specify if this is the AMD Ryzen 9 7900X or 7900X3D model with 3D V-Cache, but either would certainly be a big upgrade for a gaming rig.\n\nThis impressive build also comes with 32GB of 6,000MHz Crucial DDR5 RAM, a Silverstone FX600-PT PSU rated at 600W, a 2TB NVMe 2.0 SSD, a Thermalright AXP90x47 CPU cooler, and a Noctua NF-A12x15 fan. With a 6.4 liter case such as this one, you\u2019d expect thermals to be tight, but Jakob runs his RTX 4070 overclocked and says it only peaks at 158\u00b0F (70\u00b0C) under load. The 8400F CPU, meanwhile, sticks to 167\u00b0F (75\u00b0C).\n\nConsidering the constraints involved in building any small form factor (SFF) PC, this particular build is really impressive. While you can\u2019t buy this case for your own gaming PC build, it shows just how small your gaming PC can get if you\u2019re prepared to shop around (or even print) your components.\n\nIf you want a small gaming rig for yourself, check out our best mini gaming PC guide, where we list some of our favorite small form factor gaming PCs that you could pick up for yourself.\n\nHowever, if you want a handheld that truly fits in your hand, you\u2019ll need to check out our best handheld gaming PC guide, where we list some even smaller alternatives to power your on-the-go gaming sessions."

            "article_content": "Explore Valve's evolving strategy for Steam Machines, from their initial launch to the impact of the Steam Deck, and what the future holds for living room PC gaming.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long and winding road for Valve\u2019s Steam Machines. First announced in 2013, these pre-built gaming PCs, designed to bring PC gaming to the living room, were met with a mix of excitement and skepticism. After a somewhat underwhelming launch and years of relative silence, many wondered if Valve had abandoned the project altogether. However, recent developments suggest that Valve\u2019s grand vision for Steam Machines might finally be coming into focus, albeit in a different form than initially imagined.\n\nThis article delves into the history of Steam Machines, exploring their initial goals, their struggles, and how Valve\u2019s evolving strategy, particularly with the success of the Steam Deck, might be the key to finally realizing their initial ambition: to make PC gaming more accessible and widespread.\n\nThe Rise and Fall (and Rise?) of Steam Machines\n\nWhat were they? Steam Machines were pre-built gaming PCs designed to run Valve\u2019s SteamOS, a Linux-based operating system optimized for gaming. The idea was to offer a console-like experience with the openness and flexibility of PC gaming.\n\nWhy did Valve create them? Valve aimed to bridge the gap between PC and console gaming, offering a user-friendly experience with access to the vast Steam library. They wanted to challenge the dominance of consoles in the living room.\n\nWhat went wrong? Several factors contributed to the lukewarm reception of Steam Machines:\n\nLimited game compatibility: SteamOS, being Linux-based, initially struggled with compatibility issues, limiting the number of games available.\n\nHigh price point: Early Steam Machines were often more expensive than comparable gaming consoles.\n\nLack of marketing: Valve didn\u2019t heavily promote Steam Machines, leading to low consumer awareness.\n\nCompetition from consoles: The PS4 and Xbox One offered strong competition with established game libraries and exclusive titles.\n\nWhere are they now? While Steam Machines never truly took off, the underlying technology and vision behind them continued to evolve. The Steam Controller, initially designed for Steam Machines, found a niche audience. More importantly, the development of Proton, a compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run on Linux, significantly expanded the SteamOS game library.\n\nThe Steam Deck: A Turning Point\n\nThe release of the Steam Deck in 2022 marked a significant shift in Valve\u2019s strategy. This handheld gaming PC, powered by SteamOS, proved to be a massive success, showcasing the potential of Valve\u2019s gaming ecosystem beyond traditional desktops.\n\nHow the Steam Deck changed the game:\n\nPortable PC gaming: The Steam Deck demonstrated the viability of portable PC gaming, attracting a new generation of gamers.\n\nProton\u2019s success: The widespread adoption of the Steam Deck highlighted the effectiveness of Proton, making Linux gaming a reality for many.\n\nSteamOS refinement: The Steam Deck pushed Valve to further refine SteamOS, improving its performance and user experience.\n\nThe Steam Deck\u2019s success has reignited interest in Steam Machines. With a mature SteamOS, a vast library of compatible games thanks to Proton, and a proven hardware design, the stage seems set for Valve to revisit the living room PC gaming concept.\n\nValve\u2019s Master Plan: An Evolving Ecosystem\n\nValve\u2019s approach to Steam Machines seems to have shifted from dedicated hardware to a more holistic ecosystem approach. They are no longer focused on selling specific devices but rather on expanding the reach of SteamOS and making it the go-to platform for PC gaming across various form factors.\n\nEvidence of this shift:\n\nSteamOS 3 open source release: Valve made SteamOS 3 available to the public, allowing manufacturers to create their own Steam Machines.\n\nFocus on software and services: Valve is investing heavily in Proton, SteamOS features, and cloud gaming services, strengthening the overall Steam ecosystem.\n\nCommunity involvement: Valve actively encourages community contributions to SteamOS development, fostering a collaborative environment.\n\nThis strategy allows Valve to leverage the success of the Steam Deck while enabling other manufacturers to contribute to the hardware side. This could lead to a diverse range of Steam Machines, catering to different needs and price points.\n\nThe Future of Steam Machines: What to Expect\n\nWhile Valve hasn\u2019t officially announced any new Steam Machines, the pieces are in place for a potential resurgence. Here are some possible scenarios:\n\nPartnerships with manufacturers: Valve could collaborate with hardware partners to release new Steam Machines, leveraging their expertise in design and manufacturing.\n\nFocus on niche markets: Steam Machines could target specific segments, such as living room gaming, portable gaming, or even competitive esports.\n\nIntegration with other Valve hardware: Valve\u2019s strategy could be tightly integrated with other Valve hardware, such as the Steam Deck and Index VR headset.\n\nCloud gaming integration: Steam Machines could leverage Valve\u2019s cloud gaming capabilities, allowing users to stream games from their existing PC libraries.\n\nThe success of this renewed approach will depend on several factors, including the continued development of Proton, the performance and affordability of new Steam Machines, and the overall growth of the PC gaming market.\n\nMy Personal Take\n\nAs a long-time PC gamer and someone who eagerly followed the initial Steam Machine announcement, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about their future. The Steam Deck has proven that Valve can deliver a compelling gaming experience on a Linux-based platform. With the advancements in Proton and the growing SteamOS ecosystem, I believe Steam Machines have the potential to finally carve out a space in the living room.\n\nI remember being excited about the prospect of a console-like PC gaming experience, but the initial Steam Machines fell short of expectations. Now, with the Steam Deck paving the way, I\u2019m hopeful that Valve can learn from the past and deliver a truly compelling Steam Machine experience that bridges the gap between PC and console gaming.\n\nValve\u2019s journey with Steam Machines has been a rollercoaster ride. While the initial launch didn\u2019t meet expectations, Valve\u2019s persistence and strategic shifts, particularly with the success of the Steam Deck, have breathed new life into the concept. With a more mature SteamOS, a vast library of compatible games, and a thriving ecosystem, the future of Steam Machines looks promising. Whether they will become mainstream remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Valve\u2019s commitment to pushing the boundaries of PC gaming is unwavering."

            "article_content": "The storied Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI -0.28%) is one of the oldest and most reputable stock market indexes. The 30 Dow components are industry-leading blue chip stocks representing their respective stock market sectors. But the Dow has undergone major transformations over the last five years.\n\nThe two latest changes came this year, with Amazon (AMZN 2.94%)replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance in February and Nvidia (NVDA -1.81%) replacing Intel in November.\n\nAmazon and Nvidia wasted no time proving their value in modernizing the Dow, with both components outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.25%) and Dow indexes year to date. But investors care more about where a company is going than where it has been.\n\nHere's why Nvidia stands out as a better buy than Amazon for 2025, and some factors to consider when buying leading growth stocks at all-time highs.\n\nSucceeding together\n\nBefore getting too far into our discussion, it's worth mentioning that Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a major customer of Nvidia. So there's certainly a scenario where both companies thrive and post market-beating gains, or slowdowns at AWS trickle down to Nvidia.\n\nOn Dec. 3, Nvidia announced that its latest tech, including its Blackwell architecture for generative artificial intelligence (AI), was coming to AWS. A new computing platform available through AWS Marketplace Private Offers will allow enterprises to build AI models with the support of Nvidia experts. AWS has developed liquid-to-chip cooling across its data centers with a new solution that offers air- and liquid-cooling capabilities for powerful AI supercomputer systems like the Nvidia GB200 NVL72.\n\nNvidia is the undisputed leader in chips for hyperscalers, and AWS is the leading hyperscaler -- commanding roughly the same market share as Microsoft Cloud and Alphabet-owned Google Cloud combined. According to a Nov. 1 report from Synergy Research Group, AWS holds a 31% market share over the cloud market compared to 20% for Microsoft and 13% for Google.\n\nHowever, AWS doesn't have nearly the dominance in cloud as Nvidia does in chips for data centers.\n\nThe better business model\n\nOver its history, Amazon has been a remarkably flexible company, branching into different end markets and enduring several periods of economic uncertainty. The company's network effects, leading cloud position, growing e-commerce business, and combination of diversification and disruption are valid reasons to buy Amazon stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\nAWS' operating income comprised 62% of Amazon's total operating income for the nine months ending Sept. 30, 2024. Compared to the same period last year, AWS revenue increased by $12.22 billion, but its operating expenses only increased by $479 million, so nearly all of that revenue gain translated to operating income growth. However, without the contribution from AWS, Amazon simply isn't growing very quickly.\n\nAWS has expanded Amazon far beyond e-commerce and made it a better business, but not in the same way that chips for data centers have been a game changer for Nvidia.\n\nIn Nvidia's recent quarter, which was third-quarter fiscal 2025 (ended Oct. 27), Nvidia reported $30.77 billion in revenue consisting of $27.64 billion from compute and $3.13 billion from networking. Operating income from the compute and networking segment came in at $22.081 billion -- giving the segment a ridiculously high operating margin of 71.8%. For context, Amazon -- as a whole -- booked $17.41 billion in operating income in its recent quarter. And AWS' margins aren't nearly as high as Nvidia's.\n\nNvidia's gaming and AI PC, professional visualization, and automotive and robotics segments combined for $4.22 billion in revenue. The graphics segment earned just $1.502 billion in operating income.\n\nIt's hard to believe, but five years ago, Nvidia's data center business was smaller than its graphics segment. Whereas today, data center makes up over 85% of Nvidia's revenue and over 90% of its operating income. In the quarter, Nvidia said that cloud service providers made up around 50% of its data center revenue, while the remainder consisted of consumer internet and enterprise companies. These customers (like AWS) are some of the highest-quality customers in the world. They are the exact kind of customers Nvidia wants because they have the financial means to invest through market cycles.\n\nNvidia went from a chip company for graphics to a chip company for data centers. In contrast, Amazon still does many different things, but the best part of its business is AWS. Nvidia has better margins and more growth potential. It has a more commanding market share. And it is a more pure-play investment thesis on data center growth, whereas Amazon's investment thesis crosses more industries and is more complex.\n\nNvidia has a fair valuation\n\nNvidia's biggest risks are a slowdown in AI capital spending or competition coming along and eroding margins. But so far, that hasn't happened. Nvidia has so far been an earnings-driven story. In fact, earnings growth has outpaced the growth in the stock price.\n\nEventually, Nvidia's growth will probably slow down. But until that happens, it's hard to call Nvidia a bubble because the business is delivering real, bottom-line results. This isn't a company that has the potential to do amazing things in the future; rather, it is delivering unbelievable results right now.\n\nBecause Nvidia has been an earnings-driven story, its valuation remains reasonable. Nvidia has a higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and forward P/E ratio than Amazon. But as you can see in the chart, the gap between the valuations of both companies could narrow if Nvidia continues to grow its earnings at a faster pace.\n\nOnly buy Nvidia if you have a long-term mindset\n\nNvidia and Amazon are excellent companies that stand to benefit from higher AI spending. However, competition or a cyclical slowdown could quickly make both companies look more expensive, leading to a steep sell-off.\n\nWhen buying industry-leading growth stocks at all-time highs, it's important to understand that the factors contributing to the record highs could be the same ones leading to a sell-off. Wall Street will waste no time downgrading a stock based solely on its near-term growth prospects. However, the good news is that individual investors don't have to get caught up in the noise and, instead, can focus on the long-term investment thesis.\n\nInvestors interested in Nvidia should continue to monitor its pace of technological advancements and ability to monetize those improvements. Currently, Nvidia is out-innovating its competition, so it can still charge top dollar for its products. Furthermore, its customers are doing so well that they can afford to pay pretty much whatever Nvidia is charging.\n\nNvidia is at the top of its game, and there has yet to be any concrete reason to believe it will change. But if the cycle does turn, there will be signs from Nvidia's top customers like AWS and Meta Platforms. The stock price continues to be driven by earnings growth, which should continue next year.\n\nIn sum, Nvidia has a simpler and more effective business model than Amazon and much better growth, making it the better buy now."

The focus was on the EC2 UltraServers powered by Trainium2 chips and EC2 instances, which are now available. According to AWS, the new Trn2 instances offer 20.8 petaflops of computing power per instance and an up to 40 percent better price-performance ratio compared to the GPU-based EC2 P5 instances.\n\nAnzeige\n\nA Trn2 UltraServer consists of four Trn2 instances that are connected to each other via a NeuronLink connection. This architecture is designed to scale computing power up to 83.2 petaflops to reduce training and inference times for the world's largest AI models. Models with up to one trillion parameters could thus be processed with improved latency.\n\n\"Project Rainier\" for AI clusters\n\nAWS also announced \"Project Rainier\", which combines hundreds of Trainium2 UltraServers into an EC2 UltraCluster, enabling an increase in cluster size compared to existing solutions. These UltraClusters are used in organizations such as Anthropic to train AI models. Anthropic uses them, for example, to optimize Claude models for Amazon Bedrock on Trainium2. This infrastructure should enable customers to efficiently train models with trillions of parameters and use them in real time.\n\nRead also Amazon releases new AI model family \u2013 Nova\n\nAWS emphasized that it is not enough to increase the size of clusters to improve performance. Instead, the new architecture of Trainium2 UltraServers improves data distribution and resource allocation. This reduces the overall training time without encountering traditional network limits.\n\nNew instances with Nvidia Blackwell and outlook\n\nIn addition to the Trainium2 solutions, AWS presented the EC2 P6 instances. They are based on the next generation of Blackwell GPUs from Nvidia. Compared to the current generation, AWS promises up to 2.5 times higher performance and optimization specifically for compute-intensive generative AI applications. AWS sees the P6 instances primarily for applications that require fast response times and high scalability.\n\nAnzeige\n\nAWS has also already announced the upcoming Trainium3 chip as the successor to Trainium2. This will be manufactured using a 3-nanometer process. Compared to its predecessor, it is said to be more energy-efficient and four times more powerful. This will allow customers to iterate models faster and use them in real time. Trainium3 is expected to be available in later versions of the UltraServer.\n\n(nie)"

But the agreement \"also gives them some measure of closure and an acknowledgment that the abuse actually occurred \u2026 which can be very empowering to them.\"\n\nJo Ponticello, a therapist based in New Jersey who has counseled clergy sex abuse survivors, said one of their biggest hurdles going through the settlement process is overcoming a deep sense of shame.\n\nAnd \"of course you carry shame because there are secrets,\" said Ponticello, a licensed clinical social worker.\n\nComing forward with those secrets can be excruciating.\n\n\"If you\u2019ve been carrying something for 20 years and you haven\u2019t really talked to anybody about it and then you have this opportunity to go and disclose because there is legal action that you really support, that\u2019s a pretty daunting task,\" she said.\n\nLevins said he never told anyone, even therapists, many of the details of his abuse until he confided in his lawyers during the recent Rockville Centre proceedings.\n\nIn an interview with Newsday this week, he recalled being 16 when he first met Antonucci, who had identified himself as a Franciscan monk, or brother.\n\nFrom trust to turmoil\n\nIn the late 1970s, Antonucci was working at Infant Jesus Roman Catholic Church in Port Jefferson, according to a lawsuit the Levins brothers filed against the diocese and the parish in 2019 under the New York State Child Victims Act. That lawsuit and 600 others were transferred to U.S. bankruptcy court after the diocese declared bankruptcy in 2020, and were part of Wednesday's settlement.\n\nA few weeks before Christmas in 1977, the Levins brothers' parents separated. At Infant Jesus, a priest suggested Antonucci could help the boys get through the turmoil, caused in part by their beloved father moving out of the family home in Shoreham, Levins said.\n\nAntonucci quickly became a regular there.\n\n\"We would look forward to him because he was a very cool priest,\" Levins said. \"He was funny, charming.\"\n\nOne night there was a big snowstorm, and the family expected Antonucci to cancel a dinner invitation.\n\n\"When the doorbell rang and he was there,\" Levins said, \"we were just overwhelmed that this guy cared enough to come out in a snowstorm.\"\n\nOver dinner, Antonucci told the Levins he ran a home for boys and needed money to cover operating expenses. Levins' mother, who could barely support the family, quickly wrote out a check for $600 \u2014 a lot of money in 1977, he said.\n\nAntonucci \"put that check in his pocket, then proceeded to assault her three sons,\" Levins said.\n\nBy around 9 p.m., Antonucci was talking to Levins\u2019 15-year-old brother, Thomas, as he was lifting weights in the living room. Robert, then 16, went to bed.\n\nLevins remembers being awakened at 4 a.m. Antonucci had one hand on Levins\u2019 face and held a candle with the other. The trusted family friend from the Catholic parish then molested him, Levins said.\n\nThe next morning over breakfast, the two older brothers quietly talked about that night \u2014 and Thomas confirmed that he too was sexually abused.\n\n\"He was a pro\" at grooming the brothers for abuse, Thomas Levins told Newsday. Of abusers, he added: \"They are masters of manipulation.\"\n\nThe Levins and their mother reported the abuse to the parish staff in Port Jefferson. As far as the Levins know, nothing ever happened. The Diocese of Rockville Centre did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA third brother abused\n\nDecades later, Robert Levins learned the abuse was not limited to him and Thomas. In 2019, Levins told his brother Sean that he was filing the lawsuit. Sean Levins in turn said he too had been molested by Antonucci.\n\n\"I was floored that he would do this to a child,\" Robert Levins said. \"How evil can you be to hurt a 6-year-old?\"\n\nSean Levins died last year of a brain aneurysm at age 54.\n\nThe damage done to Robert and Thomas Levins as teenagers sent their lives into a tailspin. Robert started drinking heavily and also taking drugs. With plummeting grades, Levins said he barely graduated from high school. He didn't bother applying to college.\n\nLevins hit rock bottom when Sean, who he still refers to as his \"baby brother,\" and saw him as a role model, also saw him intoxicated.\n\n\"I could see the disappointment in his eyes,\" Levins said. \"When I sobered up I finally broke and for the first time in years cried out to God. I needed help and I knew it. I was throwing my life away.\"\n\nA concerned friend of his mother's connected Levins with a pastor at the Full Gospel Tabernacle in East Setauket who counseled him for a year and eventually told him he had a calling to ministry. The pastor suggested Levins attend a Bible college in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.\n\nLevins did, and by the age of 25, and disillusioned by the Catholic Church, he had become an ordained minister in the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination.\n\n\"I\u2019ve kind of turned this nightmare in my life into something positive for somebody else,\" said Robert Levins, now a Pentecostal minister who counsels other survivors of clergy sex abuse. Credit: Photo courtesy Robert Levins\n\nHe said praying and becoming an ordained minister and spiritual leader to others changed, and most likely saved his life.\n\n\"Without God I would have lost my mind or become an alcoholic,\" Levins said. \"I was just sliding downhill so quickly. I decided that this is the way that I can help people.\"\n\nHe also had a gnawing sense that the pain of his past remained unresolved. So, several years ago, with the help of a private detective, Levins said he tracked down Antonucci and got him on the telephone. He needed to confront Antonucci and also make sure the man that had molested him and his brothers was far away from children.\n\nAntonucci\u2019s response was chilling, Levins said. He didn\u2019t deny the abuse but defended it, telling him he had done good work in his ministry.\n\nThomas Levins said Antonucci's sexual abuse left him depressed and his life in turmoil. His grades dropped in high school. A standout pitcher growing up, he had visions of playing baseball in college. His senior year in high school, Thomas Levins said, he didn't try out for the team.\n\n\"Your whole world gets shattered,\" he said.\n\nNow 62, and a carpenter in Pennsylvania, the middle Levins brother is married for the third time. He has trouble trusting people as he and his older brother continue to heal.\n\nRobert Levins over the decades has also helped other survivors of clergy abuse heal through his ministry in Pennsylvania, Florida, New Jersey and North Carolina where he now is based near Raleigh. He has counseled hundreds of survivors.\n\n\"I tell them all, we are not going to wipe clean the memory. This is never going to go away,\" he said. But you must \"manage it so it doesn\u2019t hold you prisoner for the rest of your life.\""

            "article_content": "We have only one example of biology forming in the universe \u2013 life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don\u2019t know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI\u2019m an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I\u2019ve learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there\u2019s advanced alien life out there, I\u2019m on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2013 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it\u2019s a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don\u2019t agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \u201cself-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\u201d That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet\u2019s atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA\u2019s definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2013 biological or not \u2013 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism\u2019s genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life\u2019s essential molecules \u2013 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they\u2019re unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they\u2019ll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nRead More: NASA report finds no evidence that UFOs are extraterrestrial\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth\u2019s crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that\u2019s for life as we know it \u2013 for life as we don\u2019t know it, all bets are off."

At least five drone-like UFOs are seen in his 50-second clip\n\nOne of the UFO drones, whose engines can be heard roaring from the ground, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly with red lights blinking at its wingtips and tail (above)\n\nBut the New Jersian who posted the new footage of these drones online maintains the answer lies within America's own classified world of black budget projects.\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' TikTok user @_bucky13 commented under his phone video of the eerie UFOs, captioned\n\n'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.'\n\n'I think they are trying to scare Russia by demonstrating some secret weapons,' he wrote.\n\nThe camera was pointed to the sky when the drones came into view.\n\n'There they are! There are more in New Jersey!,' he can be heard shouting in his handheld video \u2014 as an unsettled woman off-camera says, 'We shouldn't be outside.'\n\n'They look like an f***ing triangle! They look like a triangle,' he said in disbelief, as je spotted a triangular-shaped drone cruising into the night.\n\nA later UFO or drone seemed to hover stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect.\n\n'Are you freaking kidding me right now,' one woman can be heard saying of the craft.\n\nCommenters of UFO video joined him in his suspicion that the objects may ultimately prove to be top secret US military craft, even as the TikToker can be heard marveling in his video that 'an F-16 just flew over' in hot pursuit of the unidentified craft.\n\nAccording to one NJ local, this image depicts roughly nine of the unidentified drones flying in to the Garden State from the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday night, December 5\n\nA later UFO or drone in the new video looks like it might have hovered stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect\n\n'Looks like a military drone,' one Tik Tok user said, with another chiming in 'Definitely government made drones.'\n\nMany stated with confidence that the triangle craft was the legendary and still unconfirmed TR-3B 'Black Manta' anti-gravity spy plane, the alleged follow-up to the equally unconfirmed TR-3A, both claimed to have been made by defense contractor Northrop in the early 1990s.\n\n'Those are TR-3B government drones,' one poster said. 'Look them up, they're pretty cool.'\n\nA December 1991 cover story in Popular Mechanics was one of the first mainstream media reports to allege that the TR-3A existed as a highly advanced 'tactical reconnaissance vehicle' eyewitnesses said was 42-feet long with a 60-foot wingspan.\n\nOthers have speculated that the UFOs above New Jersey might be an update to US defense contractor Lockheed Martin\u2019s original 'Darkstar' that flew in 1996."

            "article_content": "Dec. 7\u2014The arcane red light reportedly throbbed in the sky above Albuquerque's South Valley for about an hour in October 2023, caught on camera by a bewildered man who says, \"I've never seen a light that bright.\"\n\nA solid, bright orb drifted with angular elegance in February over Jal, near the state's southern border, startling an observer. As the nighttime scene unfolded near a Lea County oilfield, the observer reported feeling like the air was astir with a leaden static.\n\nVideos of these episodes of stargazing turning bizarre in a state known for enigmatic nighttime occurrences are among those catalogued by a popular UFO reporting platform and cellphone app operated by Enigma Labs. The company, founded in 2020, has issued a new report naming New Mexico its top state for sightings per capita, with several strange videos submitted this year showing lights over Albuquerque.\n\n\"New Mexico is a focal point for UFOs,\" said Alejandro Rojas, a consultant for Enigma Labs. \"But it's really interesting that New Mexico has really popped up in our data lately as being heads above the leader when it comes to submissions per person.\"\n\nThe data set comes as an obsession with unidentified flying objects continues nationwide, even after a congressionally mandated Pentagon report released in February found no evidence the federal government was covering up knowledge of extraterrestrial technology and no evidence UFO sightings are signs of aliens visiting Earth.\n\nA Pentagon office, known as the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, was created in 2022 to track what the government calls UAPs \u2014 unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 with 757 reported to the office between May and June of this year, according to a November report.\n\nStill, people continue to see things.\n\nIn the fast-paced digital age, Enigma Labs provides an online trove of oddities \u2014 an endless proliferation of sights and sounds.\n\nThe private company offers a website and cellphone app allowing UFO enthusiasts \u2014 and regular people who believe they have encountered the anomalous \u2014 to upload videos and photos with descriptions, aggregating and crowdsourcing the data.\n\n\"Like millions of ants crawling around us,\" the individual who spotted something in Jal said in the Enigma post.\n\n\"I hate to say it. Those are ships!\" gushed a man who claimed he was witnessing alien plasma ships in Gallup near the Arizona border.\n\nAll told, the Land of Enchantment's rate of 12.2 Enigma entries per 100,000 people is far higher than the next closest states of Nevada and Arizona, which boast submission rates of around 9 per 100,000 residents, according to the company.\n\nUFO researchers have theories about the large volume of entries here, citing how alien mythology and lore have been woven into the state's cultural fabric for decades. According to the National UFO Reporting Center, 1,708 sightings have been reported in New Mexico, most of them since 2000.\n\n\"We have a relatively small population, but the one thing we do have, and I think this factors into your question, is a preponderance of military operations areas and scientific development areas \u2014 Los Alamos [National Laboratory], Sandia [National Laboratories] \u2014 a rich history of sightings,\" said David Marler, a longtime UFO researcher who lives in the Albuquerque area and serves as the executive director of a new UFO records center in Rio Rancho.\n\nWhile the Roswell incident has long been a dominant talker, Marler said there are many other intriguing reports of encounters over the last 75 years in New Mexico: April 1964, Socorro; April 1964, La Madera; March 1950, Farmington; November 1957, Kirtland Air Force Base.\n\nA prevalent state for sightings\n\nEnigma Labs runs a New Mexico page that archives and cataloging sightings, rating and categorizing videos.\n\nAs of late November, the company had received 278 New Mexico sightings directly, according to an email from Rojas. Combined with publicly available sources, it has 3,531 total sightings in New Mexico archived.\n\n\"When you go back and look at early magazine reports and military reports going back to the 1950s, there were magazine articles showing maps where a lot of UFO sightings. One of the most prevalent states was New Mexico,\" Marler said.\n\nA fascination with the unknown has long gripped New Mexico. It's a state renowned \u2014 thanks to its dry climate, low population density and sprawling deserts \u2014 for its night sky viewing.\n\n\"One of the most spectacular reports is from last August. A witness said they were watching TV when they caught this weird object out of the corner of their eye. They were able to get a few seconds of video before it disappeared behind nearby trees,\" Rojas said of video footage taken in Chaparral, a Southern New Mexico community near El Paso.\n\nThe video shows a floating gray object with a television heard in the background.\n\nNew Mexico sightings logged into the Enigma Labs database break down like this: Albuquerque, 754; Las Cruces, 159; Roswell, 143; Alamogordo, 107; and Deming, 95. Rojas said eight sightings have been reported to Enigma from Santa Fe and one in Los Alamos.\n\nTwo friends were driving along San Mateo Boulevard in Albuquerque late one night in February when a moving craft in the sky lit up with lights flashing in a diagonal pattern.\n\nIn an episode that lasted about a minute, \"it went from a long craft to a triangle shaped craft with only 3 lights, and then to something that resembled a helicopter with one light, and quickly disappeared,\" states the caption on the for the video posted to Enigma Lab's site.\n\nNew records center in Rio Rancho\n\nTens of thousands of case files, among the earliest dated in 1947, are housed in Rio Rancho. They relay the stories of witnesses, couched in the diction of reports written by law enforcement officers or members of the military as far back as 70 years ago.\n\nThe files can be pored over at the new National UFO Historical Records Center, a facility that recently opened and can be visited by appointment.\n\n\"It's the largest historical archive ever assembled on the history of the subject in the history of the United States,\" said Marler, the director.\n\nThe volunteer-operated research center, at 1301 Nicklaus Drive SE, opened in October.\n\nIt holds rolls of decades-old microfilm, hundreds of thousands of audio recordings, an exhaustive library of foreign and domestic magazines, newsletters and periodicals \u2014 all dealing with reports of mysterious craft spotted from Earth. Some 2,000 books line the shelves, along with an interminable supply of UFO investigations and intrigue, with tales and testimony for those who believe.\n\n\"It's really set up for academics and for the general public who have a serious interest in the subject. It's not for the casual enthusiast per se,\" Marler said.\n\nThe center has files from the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena, records kept by the largest citizen organization in the U.S. devoted to cataloguing UFO reports from 1956 until 1980, the year the group published its final newsletter. The center is currently digitizing the files for the first time ever.\n\nAlso in its possession are collections from the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization, once based in Alamogordo, with tens of thousands of case files \u2014 as well as collections from the UFO Research Committee of Akron, especially active in the 1950s in Ohio.\n\n\"We're literally getting these holdings in from all different points of the globe,\" Marler said.\n\nWell-documented cases beyond Roswell\n\nAcademics of unexplained phenomena have descended on the Land of Enchantment for a beloved UFO festival in Roswell. But the mythic narratives don't go dry there.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Roswell, Roswell, Roswell. That always dominates the conversation and there are better, more well-documented cases on file,\" Marler said, referring to the 1947 crash of a craft near the Southern New Mexico city. While many believe it was an extraterrestrial spacecraft, the federal government has said it was a secret military balloon aimed at detecting Soviet atomic bomb tests.\n\nMarler said many New Mexicans aren't aware of other cases within their own state.\n\nIn November of 1957, a UFO was tracked on radar and \"violated\" the perimeter of the Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, hovering around restricted sites, according to reports Marler has reviewed. He said the Rio Rancho records center has the original case file on it from \"Project Blue Book,\" the Air Force name for a project that investigated UFO reports between 1947 and 1969.\n\n\"Two Air Force personnel were observing it with binoculars at night. They described it as looking like a car standing vertically on end with a white light emanating out of the bottom. The object had the ability to hover, to rapidly accelerate, to move slowly,\" Marler said.\n\nThe Socorro incident in April 1964 \u2014 unresolved in the Air Force investigations that transpired at the time and widely reported by New Mexico news publications \u2014 was observed by local police Officer Lonnie Zamora, who claimed he witnessed two humanoids beside a shiny, egg-shaped object that later rose into the air from an arroyo as flames belched from the rising craft.\n\nMarler said he had believed the Socorro case was an isolated one. In the last year, however, he received the APRO files and came across an account published in the Santa Fe New Mexican of a similar report four days after the Socorro incident from La Madera, a remote community north of Ojo Caliente in Rio Arriba County.\n\n\"Eyewitness Recounts Passage of 'Thing' Burning in Sky,\" reads a headline in the April 28, 1964, edition of The New Mexican.\n\n\"It talks about Socorro, but it talks about a landing in La Madera ... and it described an egg-shaped object,\" Marler said. \"... New Mexico State Police [investigated and] drew a detailed diagram of the landing site and took pictures and colored photographs.\""

            "article_content": "Rates of hunger in Africa are unacceptably high and getting worse.\n\nThe UN State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024 report reveals that food insecurity in Africa is the highest of any world region. The prevalence of undernourishment is 20.4% (some 298.4 million Africans) \u2013 over twice the global average. The figure has grown steadily since 2015.\n\nClimate change and conflict are contributing to this problem. But I suggest that something more fundamental lies at the heart of the challenge: the ideas and plans used in the postcolonial period to guide how Africa produces food and seeks to reduce malnutrition. While rates of food insecurity vary across the continent, and are worse in central and west Africa, this is a region-wide challenge.\n\nI\u2019m a scholar of African food security and agriculture. In a new book, Decolonising African Agriculture: Food Security, Agroecology and the Need for Radical Transformation, I argue that to feed Africa better, decision-makers and donors ought to:\n\nreduce the focus on commercial agricultural production as a way to address food insecurity\n\nstop thinking that agricultural development is solely about commercialising farming and supporting other industries\n\nadopt an agroecological approach that uses farmer knowledge and natural ecological processes to grow more with fewer external inputs, such as fertilisers.\n\nConventional approaches have failed across various contexts and countries. I look at what\u2019s going wrong with how governments think about agriculture \u2013 and where the focus needs to be instead to tackle Africa\u2019s hunger crisis.\n\nFocus on production agriculture\n\nMany of the core ideas around agriculture date back to the colonial era.\n\nModern crop science, or agronomy, was developed in Europe to serve colonial interests. The goal was to produce crops that would benefit European economies. Although this approach has been criticised, it still heavily influences agriculture today. The idea is that producing more food will solve food insecurity.\n\nFood security has six dimensions. While increased food production might address one of these dimensions \u2013 food availability \u2013 it often fails to address the other five: access, stability, utilisation, sustainability and agency.\n\nFood insecurity is not always about an absolute lack of food, but about people\u2019s inability to get the food that is there.\n\nUnstable prices may be one reason. Or people may not have cooking fuel. Agricultural practices may be unsustainable. This often happens when farmers have limited control over how and what they farm.\n\nThe west African nation of Mali, for example, has focused on cotton exports based on the idea that it would bolster economic growth and that cotton farmers could use their new equipment and fertiliser to grow more food. Research shows, however, that this led to the destruction of soil resources, indebtedness for farmers, and alarming rates of child malnutrition.\n\nAnother example is South Africa\u2019s post-apartheid land reform initiatives, which adopted a large scale commercial agricultural model. This has led to high rates of project failure and has done little to address high rates of malnutrition.\n\nAgriculture as a first step\n\nThe second major challenge in addressing Africa\u2019s high malnutrition rates is that many countries and international organisations don\u2019t value agricultural development for itself. It\u2019s seen as the first step towards industrialisation.\n\nCommercial agriculture has become paramount. It tends to focus on a single crop, with expensive inputs (like fertilisers) and with connections to far-away markets. Smaller farms, focused on production for home consumption and local markets, are less valued. These farms may not add to national economic growth in an important way, but they help the poor achieve food security.\n\nFor example, the Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa funded a rice commercialisation project in Burkina Faso. Women farmers were encouraged to leave traditional practices behind, buy inputs, work with improved seeds, and sell to bigger urban markets. Sadly, research I worked on revealed that this didn\u2019t provide great nutritional gains for the participants.\n\nIn another case, as its diamond exports boomed, Botswana largely gave up on pursuing food self sufficiency in the 1980s. Crop agriculture was not seen as a significant contributor to the economy. This undermined the food security of poorer rural inhabitants and women.\n\nAgroecology as the way forward\n\nMounting evidence of failure suggests it\u2019s time to try a different way of addressing Africa\u2019s food security woes.\n\nAgroecology \u2013 farming with nature \u2013 is a more decolonial approach. It covers formal research by scientists and informal knowledge of farmers who experiment in their fields.\n\nAgroecologists study the interactions between different crops, crops and insects, and crops and the soil. This can reveal ways to produce more with fewer costly external inputs. It\u2019s a more sustainable and cheaper option.\n\nCommon examples of agroecological practices in African farming systems are polycropping \u2013 planting different complementary crops in the same field \u2013 and agroforestry \u2013 mixing trees and crops. These diverse systems tend to have fewer pest problems and are better at maintaining soil fertility.\n\nNo African country has fully embraced agroecology yet, but there are promising examples, many unplanned, that point to its potential.\n\nIn Mali, for example, farmers briefly abandoned cotton in 2007-2008 due to low prices. There was then an upsurge in sorghum production. This largely saved the country from the social unrest and food price protests that happened in most neighbouring countries.\n\nA few land reform projects in South Africa allowed larger farms to be split into smaller plots, which had higher rates of success and more food security benefits. This suggests that a different, less commercial approach is in order.\n\nThe beginning of a revolution\n\nAgroecology is a promising way forward in addressing Africa\u2019s worsening food crisis.\n\nIt also has the backing of many African civil society organisations, such as the Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa and Network of West African Farmer Organisations and Agricultural Producers.\n\nAfrican government leaders and donors have been slower to recognise the need for a different approach. We are beginning to see signs of change, though. For example, Senegal\u2019s former agriculture minister, Papa Abdoulaye Seck, trained as a traditional agronomist. He now sees agroecology as a better way forward for his country. And the European Union has also begun funding a small number of experimental agroecology programmes.\n\nIt\u2019s time for a major shift in perspective. We will hopefully look back on this era as the turning point that ended intellectual colonisation in the agronomic sciences."
