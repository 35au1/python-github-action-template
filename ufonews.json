            "article_content": "Testimony and several reports have exposed unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings across the country amid the national attention on apparent drone observations over recent weeks.\n\nLuiz Elizondo, the former head of the Defense Department\u2019s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, and other witnesses testified before Congress last month about an alleged government group \u201chid[ing] the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that we as Americans can handle the truth. And I also believe the world deserves the truth,\u201d Elizondo said, urging Congress to enact legislation protecting whistleblowers too afraid to come forward.\n\nThe hearing was part of a larger effort by lawmakers to investigate UFOs, or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), and determine whether elements within the government are unlawfully withholding evidence from Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, UFO sightings have been reported in every U.S. state, according to the National UFO Reporting Center, the largest independently collected set of UFO/UAP sighting reports online.\n\n6 Luiz Elizondo testified before Congress last month about an alleged government group \u201chid[ing] the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\u201d Instagram / @lueelizondo\n\nA military-trained observer reported that he was camping alone in Mountain Center, California, in October when suddenly all natural outdoor-related noises went silent and the entire area \u201clit up brighter than the brightest full moon he\u2019d ever seen,\u201d according to the UFO reporting site.\n\nThe man said he saw a bright, white oval light that was about 20 to 30 feet long and hovering at treetop level, adding that the light remained completely still and noiseless, emitted no heat, and resembled a large helicopter.\n\nSeveral pilots also reported seeing three or four UFOs in the sky over Oregon, flying at different altitudes, just a few weeks ago, KPTV reported.\n\n6 \u201cI believe that we as Americans can handle the truth. And I also believe the world deserves the truth,\u201d Elizondo said, urging Congress to enact legislation protecting whistleblowers too afraid to come forward. X / @LueElizondo\n\nThe pilots reported seeing strange, red circular lights zipping around at night, and a United Airlines pilot contacted the control tower to talk about moving lights seen over western Oregon, the outlet reported.\n\nIn April 2022, a witness said she noticed a light in the sky over a reservoir in Connecticut, believing it was potentially an unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP/UFO), according to NewsNation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always a sky watcher, so I was wondering if it was a plane,\u201d the woman told the outlet. \u201cBut the way it was moving, there\u2019s no way it was a plane.\u201d\n\n6 UFO sightings have been reported in every U.S. state, according to the National UFO Reporting Center. Doug Hood/Asbury Park Press / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\n6 Photos taken in the Bay Shore section of Toms River, NJ of what appear to be large drones hovering in the area at high altitudes. Doug Hood / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\n6 Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary flight restrictions, which expire Jan. 17, 2025, prohibiting drone flights over parts of New Jersey. Doug Hood/Asbury Park Press / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\nWhile recent sightings of drones or mysterious aircraft are not exactly UFO observations, they have, nonetheless, raised concerns and have even attracted the attention of the FBI, sparking conversation about the possibility of other unidentified flying objects in the sky.\n\n\u201cThe FBI Newark, NJ State Police, and NJ Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness are asking for the public to report any information related to the recent sightings of possible drones flying in several areas along the Raritan River,\u201d a Dec. 3 FBI statement noted.\n\nLast week, the Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary flight restrictions, which expire Jan. 17, 2025, prohibiting drone flights over parts of New Jersey after the influx of sightings, excluding drone operations in support of national defense, homeland security, law enforcement, firefighting, search and rescue or disaster response missions.\n\n6 A UFO variety was photographed when it hovered for fifteen minutes near Holloman Air Development Center in New Mexico. Bettmann Archive\n\nHowever, White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby recently told Fox News the mysterious drones flying over the country are in fact \u201clegal\u201d and \u201clawful.\u201d\n\nThe White House, in coordination with the FBI and state and local officials, examined roughly 5,000 sightings, and their analysis concludes that \u201clawful, legal, commercial hobbyist and even law enforcement aircraft activity\u201d is responsible for the sightings, Kirby said about the assessment.\n\nIn a recent statement by the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Department of Defense, the agencies said that while they \u201crecognize the concern,\u201d there is no evidence that the drones are \u201canomalous\u201d or a threat to national security or public safety."

            "article_content": "New Delhi: India\u2019s technology sector is likely to see generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) and related data applications define client orders, financial growth and technical innovation in 2025. In turn, this is expected to generate a spurt in demand for data centres and their services.\n\nIndustry stakeholders ranging from the US\u2019s Big Tech firms, as well as data centre and software services companies, are gearing up for a boom in demand amid expectations of easing inflation concerns in the West, and the Indian government\u2019s boost to domestic research and development (R&D) expenditure in the coming year.\n\nOn 12 December, Mint reported that the Centre was evaluating plans to roll out $3 billion in incentives to boost R&D in India. The country, already a hub for fresh technical talent, is now looking to invest in innovation to climb up the value ladder\u2014as opposed to being a usage economy so far.\n\nAlso read | The next great leap in AI is behind schedule and crazy expensive\n\nAt the core of this push is the establishment of generative AI as a key differentiator in the near term, and its impact on data centres.\n\nOn 28 September, Mint reported that the Adani group is likely to pump in $4 billion to establish a net data centre capacity of 1.5GW (gigawatt) within the next two years, a plan that originally had a timeline of five years. This boost is driven by the influx of AI in enterprises, and the anticipated data boom that is expected to come with it.\n\nAshish Arora, chief executive of Bharti Enterprises\u2019 subsidiary Nxtra, also added that the company is investing $600 million to double its net data centre capacity to 400MW (megawatt) by 2026, a chunk of which will be expanded in 2025 itself.\n\nEarlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Yotta Data Services, a subsidiary of the Hiranandani Group, is close to finalizing a $500-million investment through a group of creditors to expand its data centre \u2018parks\u2019, which are already operational in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Greater Noida and Maharashtra\u2019s Navi Mumbai regions.\n\nThe uptick comes even as generative AI has struggled to keep up with its heightened hype of rapidly transforming businesses. Driven by data privacy and copyright concerns, enterprises have largely remained cautious in adopting the technology rapidly through this year.\n\nAlso read | How scammers are using AI this holiday season to steal your money\n\nThe early signs of change, however, are here. On 19 December, Accenture, the world\u2019s largest technology services outsourcing and consultancy firm and a bellwether for India\u2019s $300-billion IT services sector, disclosed $1.2 billion in net new generative AI deals with businesses worldwide. generative AI, thus, comprised 6.4% of total new business during the company\u2019s Q1FY25 period, which in its reporting runs from September to November.\n\nThe first week of January, thus, will be key to see if India\u2019s IT services stalwarts, led by heavyweights Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and HCL Technologies, can keep up with Accenture\u2019s pace of executing generative AI applications with clients.\n\nEarlier this fiscal, K. Krithivasan, chief executive of TCS, had said that the company has a business pipeline worth $1.5 billion for generative AI. During the company\u2019s October earnings call for Q2FY25, Krithivasan further added that the company has 600 active generative AI projects. However, crucially, he declined to comment on the amount of revenue TCS is drawing from AI\u2019s youngest brainchild.\n\nAdoption likely to rise\n\nIndustry stakeholders, however, are bullish that 2025 is likely to see generative AI go on a stronger run of adoption, as the technology itself becomes more mature, and businesses find a way to implement them at the core.\n\nOn 11 December, Google announced its new generation of generative AI models under the Gemini 2.0 suite, underlining its suitability for \u2018agentic\u2019 AI applications, which experts said was a clear sign of the company trying to convince businesses of the technology\u2019s usability.\n\n\u201cAI isn\u2019t just an enabler anymore\u2014it\u2019s becoming the backbone of how industries innovate, scale, and solve their most complex challenges,\" said Sindhu Gangadharan, chairperson of Centre-affiliated think-tank Nasscom, and managing director of SAP Labs India. \u201cAI is evolving from being assistive to becoming truly intelligent, with autonomous agents capable of making decisions and orchestrating entire ecosystems.\n\nGangadharan added that custom AI, in particular, is emerging as a transformative force in 2025, allowing organizations to design AI solutions tailored to their specific needs. \u201cThis trend is set to democratize AI innovation. For India, this is an incredible opportunity\u2014we\u2019re perfectly positioned to lead this AI-driven transformation,\" she said.\n\n\u201cMore organizations are experimenting with building custom AI solutions tailored to industry needs, including custom copilots and AI agents,\" said Irina Ghose, managing director of Microsoft India. She added that Indian enterprises are at the forefront of this shift in scaling AI and data use cases to \u201cdrive innovation, improve productivity and streamline workflows\u2014bringing India on the brink of an AI-driven renaissance\".\n\nAlso read | The AI robots on their way will mostly be made in Asia\n\nGhose further added that as far as generative AI is concerned, there is no doubt that with the right combination of data and associated computing power, businesses across industries can be considerably redefined.\n\n\"2024 was the year of AI in action, and we saw a transformative shift in how companies approach AI, moving from exploration to execution. Increasingly, more and more organizations are experimenting with building custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs, including custom copilots and AI agents. The business opportunity of AI is clear. According to an IDC study, for every dollar a company invests in generative AI, the return on investment is 3.7x. On top of this, 92% of AI deployments are taking 12 months or less at an enterprise level,\" Ghose said.\n\nIpsita Dasgupta, managing director of HP India, said it was important to empower SMBs (small and medium businesses), which contribute about 30% of GDP but face various barriers, with AI technology. \u201cThe future of work means a more flexible, inclusive and digitally connected environment where technology empowers individuals and businesses of all sizes. AI PCs and advanced workstations will be at the core of this change,\" Dasgupta said.\n\nThe key, experts believe, will be in how generative AI grows in the coming year. Pointing out that generative AI is still only a two-year old technology, Jayanth Kolla, partner at tech consultant Convergence Catalyst, said we are still understanding a lot about it.\n\n\u201cThat said, the advent of domain-specific applications through generative AI is a key area of business interest, and whichever way you look at it, the boom in data centre demand is unavoidable in India as a result. As enterprises ramp up AI consumption, this demand will only rise, without any concerns of slowdown or saturation at least in the near-term,\" Kolla said.\n\nThere are also new directions that AI and data centre evolutions can take in the coming year. For AI, much will depend on what the US behemoths of Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI will do in the coming year. 2024 already saw reasoning AI make a debut, although the use cases of the latter will only build over time. For data centres, figuring out the energy consumption conundrum will be key, as net-zero and climate change accord targets inch closer.\n\nThe earliest proof of the generative AI pudding, each stakeholder agrees, is likely going to come in the first quarter of the upcoming fiscal\u2014suggesting that the true boom in AI and data centres could take until at least the middle of the year to play out. Despite that, all of them are certain that unlike the promise of 5G or satellite internet, there are no external factors that can stop 2025 from being the year for data centres and generative AI to define India\u2019s tech industries."

            "article_content": "At launch events for both the iPhone 16 and iOS 18, Apple made much of its new Apple Intelligence software features: a collection of AI tools and features intended to help you get more from your iPhone. Now, those features are starting to roll out\u2014though we\u2019re still waiting for certain upgrades.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you can do at the moment in Apple Intelligence on iOS 18.2, in the parts of the world where it has launched (including the US and Canada). You\u2019ll also need an iPhone 15 Pro, an iPhone 15 Pro Max, or any of the iPhone 16 models to access these AI functions.\n\nGetting started with Apple Intelligence\n\nYou\u2019ll be prompted to set up Apple Intelligence right after upgrading to iOS 18, but if you need to set it up later, head to Settings in iOS: Tap More for Your iPhone, and then Set Up Apple Intelligence. You\u2019ll get an explanation of some of the AI upgrades you can use, and a short demo of how they work.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can also choose to enable notification summaries as you work through the setup process. The feature will be explained on screen, but it\u2019s basically exactly what it sounds like: Apple Intelligence will attempt to summarize multiple notifications from the same apps, so you don\u2019t have to waste time wading through each one.\n\nChatGPT is one of the features you\u2019ll need to set up. Screenshot: Apple\n\niOS will give you the option of choosing particular categories for summaries (you can change this later if needed): News & Entertainment, Communication & Social, and All Other Apps. Some trial and error will probably be needed to figure out how you want to use it\u2014it doesn\u2019t necessarily work great for break-up texts.\n\nThe AI image creation capabilities need to be downloaded and installed separately. The easiest way to trigger this is to find the new Image Playground app on your phone. Once you\u2019ve launched this, and followed the prompts on screen, the image creation setup process is initiated (you\u2019ll get a notification when it\u2019s ready to use).\n\nThis setup process covers the Image Playground app (for general AI image creation), Genmoji (emoji made from your text prompts), and the Image Wand (which lets you turn rough sketches into AI images through the Notes app). If you try to use these apps ahead of time, you\u2019ll see a message saying the necessary files are still being downloaded.\n\nApple Intelligence can be managed from iOS Settings. Screenshot: Apple\n\nFinally, you can set up ChatGPT inside Siri. If you choose Apple Intelligence & Siri from iOS Settings then tap on ChatGPT, you can give Siri access to ChatGPT for longer or more complex answers. You can connect an existing ChatGPT account to Siri, but you don\u2019t need to (if you\u2019ve got a ChatGPT Plus account, connecting this will mean you \u201ccan use advanced ChatGPT capabilities more often\u201d according to Apple).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Apple Intelligence & Siri menu in Settings gives you access to most of the settings you\u2019ll need to manage AI on your iPhone. You can enable or disable the AI features on your handset, for example, as well as control which apps have access to these tools (you might not want every app infused with some extra AI).\n\nUsing Apple Intelligence\n\nRight now, you can split Apple Intelligence features on the iPhone into three sections. The first is Writing Tools, which show up in any app with a text box: Select the text you\u2019re composing, then tap Writing Tools on the toolbar that pops up. You can have the text rewritten in a certain style or tone, or proofread it for errors. You can also expand or shorten blocks of text, and compose new text with ChatGPT.\n\nYou can also use Writing Tools to summarize existing blocks of text. For example: Highlight text on a webpage, then choose Writing Tools, and you can pick from Summary, Key Points, List, or Table to get a more digestible breakdown. You can use it on long emails, long documents, or anywhere else summaries are useful. These summaries are presented in a separate overlay on screen.\n\nYou can expand on your own writing, and summarize other text. Screenshot: Apple\n\nThe second group of tools covers image creation, and we\u2019ve already mentioned the three key components in the setup section. Launch the Image Playground app, and you can start prompting: Ask for a cabin in the woods, or a cosy winter scene, or a cat heading off to space on a rocketship. Whatever you can imagine, Image Playground can create. You can also add to prompts using suggested themes, costumes, and other tweaks.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGenmoji is similar, but for emojis: Look for the Genmoji symbol on the right of the emoji keyboard in any app. There\u2019s also the Image Wand, which you can find in the drawing tools inside any note in Notes: Tap the pen icon then the wand (which looks like a magic wand), and you\u2019re able to start creating images with a combination of AI and your own drawing.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s ChatGPT in Siri. Whenever you launch Siri by saying \u201chey Siri\u201d or by pressing and holding the power button, you\u2019ll see a suggestion to use ChatGPT for certain prompts and questions. You can also specify that ChatGPT gets used in your requests\u2014so you could say \u201chey Siri, use ChatGPT to plan out a birthday party for a 5-year-old that lasts an hour\u201d for example.\n\nImage Playground lets you combine different ideas together. Screenshot: Apple\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChatGPT can also lend a hand in a feature called Visual Intelligence, though this is an iPhone 16 exclusive. Launch the iPhone Camera app, get something in shot, then press and hold the Camera Control button on the side of your phone. Tap the speech bubble button on screen, and ChatGPT will give you a description of what you\u2019re looking at, and any more information you need about it.\n\nThere are more features on the way too: More advanced and personalized Siri responses are expected for iOS 18.4, and it\u2019s thought Apple is working on its own ChatGPT competitor so that eventually Siri won\u2019t need any extra help. More picture styles are apparently on the way for Image Playground too."

            "article_content": "Let's admit it\u2014even if there is an app for everything, there is always room for a few more. App developers have gotten into solving more and more micro tasks, giving us handy apps for things we didn't think we needed, and sometimes there are simply too many new apps out there to try out. Lounge compiled a list of apps, from little-known ones to those that have won awards, worth exploring today for task and notification management, taking better photos, getting new recommendations, and exploring open social networks.\n\nTo-do apps are a dime a dozen, but Karo is useful for your own tasks and also for reminding your friends, family, or co-workers. Made by Indian developer Mustafa Yusuf, the iOS app automatically sends a reminder to the person you tag in a task on WhatsApp. You don\u2019t need to have the Karo app to look at the task or mark it done. The app also has an AI assistant, which helps you create a list in natural language. Yusuf has also developed a WhatsApp bot to create tasks and has plans to develop an Android app as well.\n\nPartiful\n\nView Full Image Partiful was named Google Play's 'App of the Year' for 2024\n\nYou can easily create invitations to events on Google Calendar or any other scheduling app. But where is the fun in that? Partiful lets you design fun and customizable invites for anything ranging from house parties to a picnic. The app, which won the best app award of Google Play Store for 2024, lets you create an invite with different themes.

The app also allows you to send reminders and photos related to the event.\n\nAlso read: All the wellness tech worth taking note of in 2025\n\nHalide\n\nHalide is a popular premium app for manual photography amongst iPhone enthusiasts. The app provides Pro controls for users to control different aspects of the camera, including exposure, shutter speed, and ISO. The makers of the app introduced a Process Zero mode this year, which omits any kind of image processing used by Apple\u2019s computational pipeline. In a time when companies are racing to add more AI to image capturing, Halide wanted to move away from that. Using the Process Zero option means your images will show natural grain. This mode might not be helpful for low-light conditions. The app costs \u20b9269 per month or \u20b91,999 per year. You can also pay a one-time fee of \u20b95,900 to get all future updates.\n\nPinnit\n\nView Full Image Sort your notifications\n\nGetting a ton of notifications on your phone can be overwhelming, and you also tend to swipe them all off if they are piled up. Android app Pinnit is a notification history keeper, so you can look back on notifications to check if you missed an important one. You can search for notifications or filter them by apps as well. You can pin a notification to act on it later or remember a task. You can add custom notifications, and in the future, the developers plan to add location-based notifications. Pinnit has a one-time fee of \u20b9170 after 14 days of trial.\n\nElevenLabs Reader\n\nIt\u2019s tough to get through your reading list regularly because of lack of time.

Our data shows that, yes, there are instances like that of course, but there are many other cases that are evidential.\n\n\"For example, being witnessed by more than one person, or these crisis cases where they didn't even know the person was dead.\n\n\"Across the board, these stories are often coming from very highly educated people with very good jobs, and not everybody's bereaved.\"\n\n'The paranormal is normal'\n\nA 2023 paper by J.K.Penberthy and others, in collaboration with the University of Northampton, discovered that 27 per cent of research participants who had ADC experiences identified as not being in a state of grieving or mourning.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, electrical phenomena in ADCs has massively increased over the years, too, presumably due to the growing number of devices the average person uses now.\n\n\"If we\u2019re to believe that the deceased live on somewhere, then they are seemingly more and more able to affect electronics and phones,\" Sophie says.\n\n\"I\u2019ve had evidence of things like, 'My deceased husband sends me text messages every week', 'I\u2019ve had a voicemail from my brother after he passed on', and switched-off iPads suddenly playing the departed\u2019s favourite song.\n\n\"Physical phenomena is very common.\"\n\nThe beliefs of Brits AROUND half (46 per cent) of Brits believe in life after death, according to a study by Kings College London. Gen Z (51 per cent) and Millenials (53 per cent) have the highest rates of belief. But the share of the British public who identify as religious has halved since the 1980s. The UK public are now among the least likely internationally to believe in God. Just under half (49 per cent) of Brits said they believed in God in 2022 \u2013 down from three-quarters (75 per cent) in 1981. Of 24 nations in the study, only five are now less likely than the UK to say they believe in God, with China (17 per cent) by far the least likely to. And the share of the British public who say God is not important in their life has doubled and is now at a record high, rising from 28 per cent to 57 per cent between 1981 and 2022. Between 1981 and 2022, the share of the public believing in heaven fell from 57 per cent to 41 per cent. Despite this, the idea of heaven is still more popular than hell, which 26 per cent said they believed in in 2022 \u2013 a figure largely unchanged since trends began. While younger people have lower levels of religious belief and are more likely to identify as atheists, Gen Z (32 per cent) and Millennials (32 per cent) are in fact more likely than Baby Boomers (18 per cent) and the Pre-War generation (24 per cent) to believe in hell. And by international standards, the UK is less likely to believe in hell, ranking 17th out of 24 countries \u2013 and far behind some peer nations such as the US (69 per cent) and Italy (39 per cent). Views on life after death have held up well over the last four decades, with just under half of the public \u2013 including 46 per cent in 2022 \u2013 consistently saying they believe in it, the study found.\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to prove that there really is life after death, Sophie says it\u2019s the impact of these experiences on the grieving process that is really important.\n\nThe ADC questionnaire has shown that the majority found the ADCs comforting (81 per cent) and helpful in their bereavement (84 per cent).\n\nOnly 12 per cent of respondents in the study reported their ADC as frightening.\n\n\"The main aim of this work is to show the public that the paranormal is normal,\" she adds.\n\n\"And these experiences can have positive psychological effects.\n\n\"Real or not, these experiences mean the world to people who have them.\n\n\"Neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud described sensing the presence of the deceased as \u2018hallucinatory wishful psychosis\u2019, and he advised we cut emotional attachment to deceased loved ones.\n\n\"Well, now there are quite a lot of studies proving that being open to a connection with a deceased loved one is really beneficial to the grieving process and mental health.\"\n\nAnother key impact of an ADC is of course a new belief in life after death, something 92.8 per cent of study participants now say they hold.\n\n\"Going by the messages we\u2019ve received, it\u2019s beneficial for the deceased, too,\" says Sophie.\n\n\"Some people report being told that their departed loved one can't go much further while those left behind are so sad.\n\n\"They invite them to let that grief go, so they can get on with the next chapter.\"\n\nTo find out more and to contribute your ADC experiences to the study, visit adcrp.org or @after_death_communication, or buy a book based on the research on Amazon."

            "article_content": "What do cattle mutilations, a grave robber and a good Samaritan have in common? They are all featured on Dean Petersen\u2019s Wyoming-based podcast, \u201cThat Doesn\u2019t Happen Everyday.\u201d\n\nPetersen of Cheyenne has been fascinated since an early age by the out-of-the-ordinary and downright bizarre stories that happen to everyday people. He has channeled that curiosity about the odd into his Wyoming-based podcast where he interviews a wide array of people in his efforts to dig up the strange.\n\n\u201cI would hear my parents talking about things that had happened when they were kids,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cUsually, it was kind of the mundane stuff about growing up on ranches in the Bridger Valley between Evanston and Green River. But once in a while, something weird would happen that they would bring up like cattle mutilations or the camp up in the mountains where lumberjacks supposedly had killed themselves.\u201d\n\nWhen Petersen moved back to Wyoming in 1999 to attend the University of Wyoming in Laramie, he began hearing these same stories from others. That was when he said he really started paying attention.\n\n\u201cA real driving influence for the podcast was hearing from other people all these legends I had heard as a kid,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cI was able to interview people and ask, did that really happen? In many cases, there's more truth than fiction with these stories.\u201d\n\nSeeking Out The Weird\n\nPetersen aired his first episode in April 2022, and it was, appropriately, a story from his parents, his original muses.\n\n\u201cMy parents had mentioned renting a house from Bob Ross, the painter on PBS,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cWhen you're a kid, you're like, \u2018Oh, of course, everyone does that.\u2019 As I got older, I saw that he's on magnets and on calendars. I did an episode about it.\n\n\u201cAt the time, Bob Ross wasn't known for painting. He was just an everyday guy who liked to paint. He had a bunch of paintings in his basement and asked my parents if they would put them in donut boxes and ship them to his new location in Virginia. So, it was a fun story.\u201d\n\nPetersen\u2019s tagline on his podcast is \u201cwhere we interview everyday people about things that don't normally happen every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is, some of some of these people aren't exactly everyday people,\u201d Petersen admitted. \u201cFor instance, we've had an Oscar winner from Wyoming, but what's interesting about the show is how many people will share these down-to-earth or straightforward stories of interesting things happening.\u201d\n\nWhether he is exploring his family stories or chasing down obscure leads, Petersen is always on the lookout for interesting stories that he can share.\n\n\u201cIt's become kind of a license where if I'm curious about something or interested in something, I go full force in trying to find out as much as I can about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI usually do that by either trying to interview someone who has experience with something or perhaps they've written a novel about it. I try to maybe dig a little bit deeper than a lot of the podcasts that are out there.\u201d\n\nHis stories are very eclectic and go beyond the borders of Wyoming. They contain the one common theme, they are outside the ordinary and many have fun twists that surprise both the viewer and Petersen himself.\n\n\u201cHopefully it's something weird and not always paranormal,\u201d he said. \u201cI take the most interesting thing you can find and try to get as close to the truth as you can, and then cut it and edit it into a listenable format. My show doesn't generally have a lot of banter. It tends to be more like someone telling you a story.\u201d\n\nThe Wyoming Twist\n\nWhen possible, Petersen visits the actual locations in Wyoming that are featured in his stories.\n\n\u201cIt's fun because if you go to visit the site of some of these legends, it's not all roped off and behind glass here in Wyoming,\u201d he said.\n\nThe areas that Petersen explores are not always marked on a map, and he has to rely on locals to point him in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThere were these lumberjacks killing themselves south of where my parents live,\u201d he said. \u201cUp in the Uinta mountains, there's a place called Suicide Park, and with a name like that, I asked them, \u2018Hey, you know what happened?\u2019\u201d\n\nHis parents knew the story and Petersen learned that several lumberjacks had died at this particular spot, and at least one or two were suicides.\n\n\u201cThere wasn't really much of a map or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got in my dad's truck and drove and drove through the mountains. Finally, we found the site, and there's one marker there.\n\n\u201cBy and large, it's your adventure. It's not something that's been paved and explained away. It's kind of fresh history for you to check out personally.\u201d\n\nPetersen stresses the importance of getting out to experience the history for yourself in remote Wyoming areas rather than just reading or listening to the story itself.\n\n\u201cIt has a special value when you are willing to get out of the office and go see something personally,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if there's not a lot there, to me, there's just that feeling of wanting to stand where someone else stood, of hearing the same sounds they might have heard, especially in Wyoming, where so much of it is undeveloped.\n\n\u201cIf you go to a site where something happened 150 years ago out in the middle of nowhere, it probably hasn't changed much as opposed to if you lived in a more developed or built up area.\u201d\n\nIf it\u2019s wacky, wild or weird in Wyoming, Dean Peterson of Cheyenne is talking about it. Even the paranormal is fair game for his \u201cThat Doesn\u2019t Happen Everyday\u201d podcast.

Even the paranormal is fair game for his \u201cThat Doesn\u2019t Happen Everyday\u201d podcast. (Courtesy Dean Petersen) Arrow left Arrow right\n\nFinding The Stories\n\nPetersen\u2019s stories range from the modern to the historic. He relies on oral histories from the Wyoming State Archives and the American Heritage Center in Laramie for much of his unique, first-hand accounts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that someone had the foresight to sit down with someone and get a story from them, from people who recovered bodies from airplane crashes to a parapsychologist who worked at the University of Wyoming,\u201d he said. \u201cI have started to research interviews from UFO witnesses, and the guy who recorded them had a PhD but he was willing to go out on a limb as a psychologist and start to interview these people and found out many of their stories were credible.\u201d\n\nPetersen is constantly surprised \u2014 and delighted \u2014 by the stories he has managed to find and the people willing to talk to him.\n\n\u201cThe most recent show was about a guy who had been a recon Marine, but now is an artist,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think it's funny because in the world of stereotypes and generalities, we don't usually think of Marines as artists or artists as Marines. It's not always about history, but it's almost always from Wyoming.\u201d\n\nAnother advantage to exploring Wyoming stories is that Petersen has found people in the Cowboy State to be approachable and willing to talk about the strange.\n\n\u201cOne time I emailed a Cheyenne gallery owner, Harvey Deselms, on Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cJust out of the blue, I sent him a message on Facebook saying, \u2018Hey, I heard the legend about dead bodies in the basement there. Could I interview you for my podcast?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe answer was yes.\n\n\u201cHe was very matter of fact about what happened with the body,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cI want to make it clear that what happened there occurred before Harvey ever moved his art gallery into the building. In fact, I learned there were two different murders in his building, and one of the victims had been buried in the basement.\u201d\n\nAs Petersen continues to dig around for stories, he has noticed that those in Wyoming tend to be pretty close to their history.\n\n\u201cHistory and culture are important to people in Wyoming, and it's not in an abstract way. I hear from people that my grandfather built that ranch or my grandmother taught at that one room schoolhouse, these kind of stories. It's very immediate and very close.\u201d\n\nA Family Adventure\n\nPetersen is also creating his own Wyoming memories with his kids in tow.\n\n\u201cI've made them come on some of the adventures, and sometimes they're really not that into it, honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat's fun, though, is that they do pay attention even when I don\u2019t think they are. They know where one of their favorite podcasts took place and like to talk about it.\u201d\n\nPetersen took his kids to a ranch by Fort Fred Steele State Historic Site where a friend had told him about two really strange incidents.\n\n\u201cThey had a bison that was mutilated,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a footprint or a tire track or anything around and they've also had some paranormal things that are just spooky happen there. Whenever I take the kids by there, they get excited and point it out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this excitement for Wyoming\u2019s odd stories that keeps Petersen searching for material for the next episode of \u201cThat Doesn\u2019t Happen Everyday.\u201d\n\nJackie Dorothy can be reached at jackie@cowboystatedaily.com."

            "article_content": "Nestled in a stunning Massachusetts city is an eerie hotel with a chilling history.\n\nIt is the site of one of America's most notorious murder mysteries, and for just $250 a night visitors can stay in the room where one of the gruesome slayings occurred.\n\nKnown as the Lizzie Borden House, the hotel in Fall River is where the woman's father and stepmother were found brutally hacked to death with an ax in 1892.\n\nShe was charged with the gruesome double murder but sensationally acquitted. The homicide case remains unsolved to this day.\n\nAround 130 years on, the property was bought by Lance Zaal, who runs US Ghost Adventures, and turned into a bed and breakfast for true crime enthusiasts.\n\nThe bodies of wealthy businessman Andrew Borden and his second wife Abby were found in the eight-bedroom mansion in the morning of August 4, 1892.\n\nPolice photos taken of the scene showed Andrew lying on a living room couch with bloody head that had been almost entirely caved in.\n\nAbby was pictured slumped over on the floor in a pool of blood and suffering from horrific head injuries in an upstairs bedroom.\n\nLizzie, then 32, found the bodies and alerted the housekeeper Bridget Sullivan, who was outside washing the windows.\n\nHer sister Emma was away at the time and Lizzie quickly became the prime suspect, with police at the time believing she had killed the couple to ensure they would get her father's $300,000 fortune (worth over $10 million today).\n\nPictured: The Lizzie Borden House, which is now run as a museum, a bed & breakfast and supposedly, a prime location to see ghosts and spirits\n\nOn the morning of August 4, 1892, wealthy businessman Andrew Borden and his second wife Abby were found bludgeoned to death in the eight-bedroom mansion\n\nThe net closed in on Lizzie when she was found to have burned a dress similar to the one she wore on the day of the murders in the week after her parents' killings.\n\nShe claimed the dress had been covered in paint, but prosecutors said she was burning the blood-stained dress to cover-up the murders. Prosecutors also said she had bought a small ax the day before.\n\nWitnesses at her trial would also later claim they saw Lizzie trying to buy prussic acid, now known as hydrogen cyanide, the day before the murders.\n\nLizzie was arrested and charged with the murders on August 11, 1892.\n\nBut after a widely publicized trial, she was acquitted on June 20 following just 90 minutes of jury deliberations.\n\nIt is believed jurors were swayed by the fact she was an active member of the local church\n\nPolice had also refused to carry out fingerprint testing on the murder weapon found in the basement, claiming the technique was unreliable.\n\nNo one else was ever suspected or taken into custody and the case went cold. Most people still believe that Lizzie likely committed the murders.\n\nThe Borden sisters went on to inherit their father's estate and bought another home in 1894, now known as Maplecroft, where they lived together for many years before a falling out in 1905.\n\nLizzie died from pneumonia in 1927 and was buried in the family plot next to her parents.\n\nA police photo shows the body of Andrew Borden, with his head crushed and entirely unrecognizable after someone bludgeoned him with an axe\n\nA similar fate befell his wife Abby Borden, who was found in her bedroom in a pool of blood and with a gaping wound to the back of her head\n\nToday the house where the murders took place has been transformed into a museum by day and a B&B/paranormal ghost tour destination by night.\n\nThe cheapest room goes for around $250 a night.\n\nMany who have stayed over the years insist it is haunted, with some even refusing to spend the entire night.\n\nJulie Jordan, editor at large for People Magazine, along with Liz Beedle and Emily Penke visited the home on Halloween this year to see if the hype was real.\n\nTogether, the trio call themselves Ghost Moms and post videos of themselves on social media supposedly interacting with spirits from the beyond.\n\nThey went on a daytime tour and heard all the grisly details about the murders, according to the article written by Jordan.\n\nShe and her friends stayed in the housekeeper's bedroom in the attic, opting not to stay in the room where Abby died.\n\nLater, they braved Abby's bedroom and claimed they set up some sort of system that responded to changes in electromagnetic energy.\n\nThey asked the supposed spirits in the room questions and nothing happened until 'Emily wanted to know if anything minded that we were there. The lights immediately flashed,' Jordan wrote.\n\nPictured: The bedroom where Abby Borden was found murdered. She was found on the floor in a pool of blood next to her bed\n\nJulie Jordan (right), who is the editor at large of People Magazine, recently visited the Lizzie Borden House this Halloween with her friends Liz Beedle (left) and Emily Penke to see if it was as haunted as some say\n\n'We then all heard what sounded like a man\u2019s gasp from out in the hallway. The house was empty except for those of us in the room,' she added.\n\nHer conclusion was that the home 'is most definitely spooky and just might have a few spirits still hanging around, perhaps trying to solve the mystery of exactly what happened there.'\n\nSome people have since questioned if the couch in the foyer is the same one that the deceased father was found lying on.\n\nHowever, this was completely soiled and destroyed after the trial so the one there today is a replica.\n\nSince launching as a bed and breakfast, the Borden house has run into disagreements with a local business owner, resulting in two court battles.\n\nThe hotel owner sued Miss Lizzie's Coffee, which is one door down from the Borden house on Second Street over alleged trademark infringements in September 2023.\n\nIn the suit, Zaal argued that the caf\u00e9's use of hatchet logo and other similar iconography 'deceptively confuses unsuspecting customers.'\n\nHowever, US District Judge Leo T. Sorokin ruled on October 27, 2023, that the coffee shop did 'nothing' to imitate US Ghost Adventures' business and said the company does not have a trademark on the word 'Lizzie.'\n\nPictured: The entryway to the Lizzie Borden House, which changed hands in 2021\n\nRight down the street is Miss Lizzie's Coffee, which also uses aspects of the Lizzie Borden story in its business\n\nSorokin also pointed out that the hatchet logo used by Miss Lizzie's Coffee was different from the one on the hotel's sign.\n\nZaal appealed this decision but lost again in November 2024, when a three-judge panel with the First Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the lower court's ruling.\n\n'Ghost Adventures' challenge to the district court's assessment of the strength of its marks is haunted by legal confusion,' Judge Bruce Selya wrote in his opinion. 'We need go no further.'\n\nMore recently Zaal filed a $50,000 defamation suit against Joseph Pereira, the owner of the Lizzie Borden-themed coffee shop, and an unknown author of a Facebook page that has posted scathing critiques of US Ghost Adventures.\n\nZaal brought the latter case to Bristol County Superior Court this July and alleged that Pereira defamed him in a March article that ran in New Bedford's WBSM.\n\nIn the interview, Pereira blasted Zaal and his company for what he described as 'bullying tactics'.\n\nHe also warned potential witnesses who might plan on supplying supposedly false affidavits on behalf of US Ghost Adventures that he would sue them for perjury.\n\nPereira added that he would write a book titled Miss Lizzie & Me that will cover 'some of the intricacies of all this and the truth of what really happens with these so-called ghost adventures.'\n\nUS Ghost Adventures argued that these statements are defamatory, particularly because Pereira accused Zaal's company of perjury.\n\nAs part of that case, Zaal also sued the person behind the Facebook page 'Boycott the Lizzie Borden House.'\n\nPictured: The interior of Miss Lizzie's Coffee Shop, which can continue to operate since both lawsuits against it are ongoing\n\nJoseph Pereira, the owner of Lizzie's Coffee Shop, is pictured here in a mugshot. After getting into a prolonged legal battle with Lance Zaal, the owner of the Lizzie Borden House, he claimed his criminal record was leaked by a witness for Zaal's company in order to embarrass him\n\nThat since-deleted page called Zaal a 'liar' and the company 'unethical and predatory,' according to court documents.\n\nNo one appeared in court to represent 'Boycott the Lizzie Borden House' and Meta, Facebook's parent company, declined to reveal the identity of the page's creator 'except in response to a valid subpoena,' according to the civil complaint.\n\nAs for his part in the case, Pereira tried and failed to dismiss the defamation claims against him.\n\nPereira also argued in an appeals brief filed in July that a witness for US Ghost Adventures spread his 'criminal record throughout the Internet and [sent] copies to several vendors and agencies that [Pereira] uses' hoping to embarrass him.\n\nHe has been arraigned roughly three dozen times on larceny-related charges since 1982. He was last arrested in December 2019, reported The Herald News, a local Massachusetts newspaper.\n\nIn 1996, Pereira pleaded guilty to stealing more than $119,000 from more than a dozen people and spent 15 months in prison, The Herald News and The Standard-Times reported.\n\nBoth the federal trademark case and the defamation suit are open and ongoing, according to court records.\n\nAnd the battle to be the one to cash in on the Lizzie Borden murders is expected to drag on as the murder case is one of Fall River's main claims to fame."

One should not assume that this technology will be used to move humans or objects; now, scientists are examining how it could be applied to the transfer of information.\n\nHowever, a recent discovery by a team of researchers at Northwestern University could rethink the speed and mechanics of information transfer globally. The findings were published earlier this year in Optic. The current system, which relies on fiber optic cables, is fast. Through these cables, information is carried by millions of particles to transmit information from one point to another.\n\nThe scientists, whose research was funded by the US Department of Energy, were interested in examining how quantum teleportation could be integrated into the existing fiber optic infrastructure used for sending information. The research team, led by Dr. Prem Prem Kumar, underscores \u201cthe feasibility of advanced quantum and classical network applications operating within a unified fiber infrastructure.\u201d\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe discovery would reduce the number of cords and wires, allowing information to be carried between two points by a single pair of photons or light particles. Using a process called quantum entanglement, the two photons would be able to send and receive information but only limited by the speed of light.\n\nGet your game on!

That's good news for jobseekers in these sectors, which were long considered to be recession-proof careers but were hit this year with waves of layoffs, job freezes, and hiring cutbacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Hodzic, a managing director at recruitment firm Selby Jennings who finds talent for hedge funds and investment banks, told Business Insider there's \"a lot of optimism\" around AI in financial services.\n\n\"Financial services institutions are slowly adopting their workflows and they've come to a reality where you need the right talent to actually build and implement and manage those products,\" he said.\n\nIn some cases, the hiring spree is already happening. Jamie Dimon, the boss of America's biggest bank JPMorgan Chase, said earlier this year that he's anticipating adding thousands of jobs related to AI in the next few years. Hedge fund and proprietary-trading firms are shelling out as much as $350,000 in annual salaries for top-tier AI researchers and engineers. Meanwhile, private-equity firms have been \"clamoring\" to hire AI operating executives to improve their portfolio companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHodzic said the rosier outlook stems from a desire to build AI tools in-house and boost worker productivity in areas like wealth advisory, investment banking, and trading. More clarity on the direction of macroeconomic factors, like inflation and the impacts of the US election, is also providing tailwinds for banks looking to invest in human capital in 2025, he said.\n\nWhile AI is expected to drive an uptick in tech hiring, the technology is also changing what it takes to get a tech job on Wall Street. BI spoke with recruiters to find out how candidates should adapt and what they need to do to stand out.\n\nThey outlined some of the industry's most in-demand skills, explained why having Big Tech experience might not get you that far anymore, and shared the companies that hiring managers want to see on resumes. They declined to disclose specific client activity due to privacy agreements.\n\nHere's what software engineers need to know to get hired on Wall Street"

The business of Baby John was impacted by the three-way clash with Pushpa 2 and Mufasa, though the first day of the film should have been in the range of Rs 13.00 crore to Rs 15.00 crore.\n\nThe non-franchise films with younger heroes are finding it tough at the box office in the post pandemic world \u2013 right from Ranveer Singh (Rocky Rani Ki Prem Kahani, 83 and Cirkus) to Vicky Kaushal (Sam Bahadur, Zara Hatke Zara Bachke) and Kartik Aaryan (Shehzada, Satyaprem Ki Katha & Chandu Champion) \u2013 have struggled to hit the double-digit mark on the first day. Varun Dhawan too has been in the same boat with Jug Jugg Jeeyo and Bhediya, though Baby John\u2019s start is the best among the films mentioned above barring the Kabir Khan directed 83.\n\nThe business was boosted due to the Christmas Holiday, but there was also competition in the urban areas from Mufasa and the mass belts from Pushpa 2. The final business of Baby John could be higher or lower depending on the walk-in audience through the evening and night shows, but very early trends suggest an opening in the above-mentioned range.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is an extended holiday period ahead, which means that there is scope to record a run and hit the Rs 100 crore mark by end of its run. There will be a drop on Thursday, but\u2019s its the hold in business on Day 2 and Day 3 that will give us an idea on the long run trajectory of Baby John. It\u2019s a decent start for Baby John, but there is a long weekend ahead and the trend over the next few days is crucial.\n\nALSO READ: Baby John Release Highlights and Movie Review: Varun Dhawan starrer action thriller aims at Rs 12 crore start"

            "article_content": "Suicides are rarely the result of a single factor. They are deeply influenced by a web of social, cultural, systemic, and economic conditions. Yet, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reports on suicides often simplify these complex issues, attributing them to a single cause. When we look closely at NCRB data, several key trends emerge.\n\nOn average, over the past eight years (2015 to 2022), nearly 1,01,188 men have died by suicide each year, compared to 43,314 women. The rate of suicide for men is 14.2 per 100,000 male population, while for women, it is 6.6 per 100,000 female population.\n\nThe primary reason for suicide, regardless of gender, is \u201cfamily problems,\u201d which account for 23.06% of suicides in India. However, the NCRB does not clearly define what constitutes \u201cfamily problems\u201d, leaving the term open to interpretation. Illness ranks the second largest cause of suicides, contributing to 23.05% of deaths.\n\nMarriage-related issues are the third most common cause, responsible for 3.28% of suicides among men and 9.66% among women. There are five sub categories under \u201cmarriage related issues\u201d listed by the NCRB \u2014 non-settlement of marriage, dowry disputes, extra-marital affairs, divorce, and others. The total number of suicides due to marriage-related issues over the last eight years is 26,588 men, and 33,480 women. Under this category, dowry-related issues are the largest cause of suicide among women (14,250), and \u201cnon-settlement of marriage\u201d is the largest cause among men (10,119).\n\nThere is no specific definition for \"non-settlement of marriage\" -- but it likely refers to unmarried persons. Senior police officers told TNM that this phrase is used when a marriage does not happen or gets cancelled, mainly due to false promises, deceit, or monetary exploitation, as well as due to dowry demands, threats, or abuse.\n\nIt's also important to note that out of the 8,09,506 men who have died by suicide between 2015 and 2022, farmers and farm labourers constitute about 10% \u2014 81,402. While the top reasons for these suicides are socioeconomic factors and crop failures, there are no sub categories for farmers who died due to another reason.\n\nSo, why do more men die of suicide?\n\nA significant factor lies in the methods men choose when attempting suicide. A research paper titled \u2018Is Lethality Different between Males and Females? Clinical and Gender Differences in Inpatient Suicide Attempters\u2019 reveals that men often use more violent and lethal methods, which results in higher lethality rates. Women, although they attempt suicide more frequently, tend to choose methods with lower immediate fatality. This often leads to a higher likelihood of rescue and intervention, whereas the more extreme measures chosen by men \u2014 such as jumping in front of trains or using firearms \u2014 result in fewer chances for survival. This difference in the lethality of methods underscores the importance of targeted suicide prevention strategies, recognising the gender-specific patterns in suicide behaviors.\n\nThe NCRB numbers are in line with this study. For every 10 women who die by methods such as sleeping pills, drowning, or consuming poison, 21 men die using similar means. Men are 61 times more likely to die by jumping in front of a train or vehicle (10:61 ratio), and 35 times more likely to die from electrocution (10:35 ratio). These figures highlight the more violent nature of male suicide attempts, which not only results in a higher death rate but also makes intervention efforts more challenging.\n\nThe 498A fight\n\nSection 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), introduced in 1983, was a pivotal legal provision aimed at protecting women from cruelty within marriage. The section specifically addresses cases where a woman is subjected to harassment or abuse by her husband or his family, including demands for dowry, emotional distress, and physical abuse. It was a response to the growing awareness of domestic violence and the need to protect women in an often patriarchal society.\n\nWith the introduction of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), the provisions of Section 498A were split into sections 85 and 86. Section 85 defines the act of \"husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty,\" while section 86 outlines the specific acts of cruelty. These provisions were intended to offer legal recourse for women facing domestic abuse.\n\nEvery year, over one lakh cases are registered under Section 498A. According to NCRB data, 1,40,019 cases were filed in 2022 alone. Over the last eight years, \"Cruelty by Husband or His Relatives\" has consistently been the most reported crime against women under the IPC. However, the average conviction rate for these cases has been just 15.7%.\n\nFor women\u2019s rights groups, the law is a crucial step in recognising domestic violence and framing cruelty as a criminal, gendered act \u2014 and the low conviction rates show the inefficiency of the system in dealing with these cases. For Men\u2019s Rights Activists (MRAs), however, the low conviction rate is evidence that the law has become a tool for revenge or extortion.\n\nWhy conviction rates are low\n\nIn her book The Trouble with Marriage: Feminists Confront Law and Violence in India, scholar Srimati Basu explores the challenges of enforcing Section 498A. She points out that one major reason for low conviction rates is the difficulty in providing clear evidence, especially in cases of mental cruelty. Convictions are more likely in cases involving additional charges, such as murder (Section 302) or dowry deaths (Section 304B).\n\nPractical barriers also hinder women from pursuing cases under Section 498A. Filing a complaint can often lead to the woman being denied access to her matrimonial home. Without alternative shelter or financial support, many are coerced into reconciliation. In some cases, families offer to settle the matter in exchange for an easy divorce, further complicating the process for women seeking justice. These systemic challenges force many women to either drop their cases or return to abusive environments, undermining the law\u2019s purpose.\n\nThe low conviction rate is frequently cited as proof of the law's misuse, but experts argue it is more reflective of the inherent difficulties in prosecuting cases of domestic violence. The Supreme Court, in a 2005 decision, acknowledged the potential for misuse but maintained that the law is essential for protecting women from abuse.\n\nMRAs claim the law is often weaponised in divorce cases, with allegations of cruelty used as leverage for alimony or property settlements. This perception, combined with the low conviction rate, fosters suspicion around the law\u2019s application. According to Srimati Basu, this atmosphere of doubt often leads to police apathy, especially toward victims from marginalised socio-economic backgrounds.\n\nAs Basu\u2019s book highlights, Section 498A underscores the complexities of addressing domestic violence in a deeply unequal society. \u201cSection 498A is huge in the popular imagination as a useful institutionalised tool to feminists and a symbol of terror, persecution, and impoverishment to those who oppose them \u2014 but it ultimately demonstrates the difficulties of negotiating plural options in the face of gendered material inequalities and proves to be weak in remedying violence,\u201d she writes.\n\nThe new petition\n\nOn December 13, Supreme Court advocate Vishal Tiwari filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court, alleging misuse of dowry laws and domestic violence statutes in India. He argued that false cases under IPC Section 498A and the Dowry Prohibition Act have led to widespread societal discord, mental health issues, and even suicides among accused men. Referencing cases like Atul Subhash's suicide, Tiwari stressed the urgency of reforming these laws to \"prevent misuse and protect innocent men.\"\n\nTiwari\u2019s petition described how the alleged misuse of dowry laws undermines the original intent behind their enactment. He argued that exaggerated claims of dowry during marital disputes often result in undue harassment of husbands and their families. To mitigate this, Tiwari proposed a system where every marriage registration application includes a detailed affidavit of all gifts, money, and items exchanged during the marriage. This affidavit, he suggested, could serve as an official record attached to the marriage certificate to avoid future disputes or fraudulent claims.\n\nThe petition referenced two significant cases to support its claims:\n\nPreeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand (2010): In this case, the Supreme Court acknowledged the growing number of matrimonial disputes and expressed concerns over exaggerated allegations in dowry and cruelty cases. The court added that criminal trials in these matters cause immense suffering for all parties involved, with even acquittals unable to erase the stigma and trauma. \u201cIt is high time that the legislature must take into consideration the pragmatic realities and make suitable changes in the existing law,\u201d the court had said.\n\nAppeal in Achin Gupta versus State of Haryana case: Tiwari noted that the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, which replaced the IPC, retains the essence of section 498A under its sections 85 and 86 with minimal changes. The Supreme Court had previously criticised this verbatim adoption, calling for legislative amendments to reflect earlier recommendations made in Preeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand.\n\nTiwari\u2019s petition sought not only the implementation of prior court observations but also the establishment of an expert committee. This committee, comprising retired judges, legal scholars, and jurists, should be tasked with reviewing existing dowry and domestic violence legislation to propose reforms aimed at curbing misuse, he has demanded.\n\nHow suicide numbers are calculated in India\n\nIndia\u2019s suicide data is primarily drawn from police records, with the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs tasked with compiling and analysing this information. The process begins when an unnatural death is reported to the local police, who investigate and classify it as a suicide if corroborated. These records are then passed through the District and State Crime Records Bureaus to the NCRB, which standardises the data and publishes annual reports. These records include details such as age, gender, marital status, and method of suicide, along with causes broadly categorised under headings like \u201cfamily problems\u201d, \u201cillness,\u201d and \u201cnon settlement of marriage\u201d.\n\nThe NCRB determines national suicide rates by calculating the number of suicides per 100,000 population using census data and mid-year population estimates.\n\nThis system has significant limitations. Suicides are often underreported due to societal stigma or potential legal repercussions, although the latter has been mitigated with the decriminalisation of suicide attempts. Researchers have also noted that female suicides are particularly prone to underreporting, given cultural and familial pressures. Another issue lies in the aggregation of data. The NCRB publishes only broad statistics, which restricts deeper analysis of individual cases or specific trends.\n\nAs Dr Soumitra Pathare described in his book, Life Interrupted: Understanding India's Suicide Crisis, what we record as suicide \"\u2026ultimately boils down to what the constable at the local police station will record as suicide.\"\n\nThe crucial work of suicide prevention\n\nAddressing these gaps is critical for improving suicide prevention is India and it must go beyond improving data accuracy. Suicide is a deeply complex issue that demands a responsible approach to it, especially when discussing it in public forums. Research show that irresponsible narratives about suicides, especially those that sensationalise or detail methods can trigger copy cat behaviour. This phenomenon known as \u201cWerther effect\u201d highlights the responsibility of media and social media platforms in shaping public understanding. Social media spaces such as Reddit, are rife with posts from individuals seeking to emulate the tragic cases of Atul Subhash.\n\nOrganisations like the Centre for Mental Health Law & Policy (CMHLP) are spearheading efforts to address this crisis. One of their key initiatives, Atmiyata, aims to foster mental health and well-being at the grassroots level. Atmiyata relies on community volunteers who provide emotional support and mental health assistance, bridging the gap for those who might not otherwise seek professional help. This initiative reflects a broader philosophy: suicide prevention is most effective when it\u2019s embedded within communities.\n\nAnother critical offering by CMHLP is their Gatekeeper Training Course for Suicide Prevention. These courses equip participants to recognise warning signs, offer support and guide individuals towards professional help. Similar gatekeeper courses are also offered by other organisations, such as Suicide Prevention India Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences broadening access to these life-saving skills.\n\nDr Kaustubh Joag, psychiatrist and program director at CMHLP, emphasises the importance of policy frameworks in addressing suicide prevention. \u201cAt the top level, we have the National Mental Health Policy of 2014 and the National Suicide Prevention Strategy of 2022. These were created at the Union government level, with the latter outlining detailed responses for various systems. While implementation is still a challenge, having a strategy and guidelines is a step forward. Some states, like Sikkim and Tamil Nadu, have even developed their own strategies based on the national framework,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Joag also highlighted the unique socio-economic context of suicides in India. \u201cGlobally, suicides are often linked to mental health conditions, but in India, mental health is not always the causative factor. Around 50% of people who die by suicide here don\u2019t necessarily have a diagnosable mental illness. Instead, their actions are often driven by life situations such as socioeconomic pressures, academic failures, or unemployment. To effectively prevent suicides, we must first understand these causative links and tailor our efforts accordingly.\"\n\nHe further stressed the importance of safe spaces, particularly for men in a patriarchal society where they are often discouraged from addressing vulnerabilities openly. \u201cCreating safe spaces is essential\u2014places where people can reach out for support during distress or suicidal thoughts. This requires sensitisation across community spaces like schools, colleges, and workplaces. Just as we've normalised good-touch and bad-touch training for children, we need similar suicide prevention training at all levels.\u201d\n\nHe advocated for a multi-pronged approach, citing WHO's contact and safety planning for suicide prevention as a key tool that can be taught to anyone, regardless of their mental health background. He also stresses the importance of helplines, which provide critical, immediate support during crises when individuals may find it difficult to reach out to someone in person.\n\nMedia plays a pivotal role in suicide prevention. Dr Joag cautioned that insensitive reporting can have devastating effects. \u201cIf suicides are not reported properly, it can trigger vulnerable individuals. There are training programs for journalists, but regional media outlets, especially those reporting in local languages, must also adopt these practices. Proper training can ensure coverage is sensitive and non-triggering.\u201d\n\nWhile the focus is on empowering communities to take proactive steps, there\u2019s also an implicit challenge here: for those who claim to care about high suicide rates\u2014whether it\u2019s men\u2019s rights activists or others\u2014these courses offer a tangible way to make a difference. Instead of merely amplifying grievances or assigning blame, enrolling in such programs is a direct and meaningful way to contribute to prevention efforts.\n\nIf you are aware of anyone facing mental health issues or feeling suicidal, please provide help. Here are some helpline numbers of suicide-prevention organisations that can offer emotional support to individuals and families.\n\nClick here for working helplines across India."

The smartphone market boom is a good testimony for it. That tech appetite is increasingly seen in the passenger vehicle market too, and it\u2019s not limited to the luxury segment. As ETAuto predicted last year , ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) qualified as a leading automotive tech trend of 2024.\u201cOn an average, over the last three months, ADAS for us is almost 1/4 of our overall portfolio, and that includes models which we launched much earlier,\u201d Nalinikanth Gollagunta , CEO of Mahindra & Mahindra\u2019s (M&M) Automotive Division told ETAuto.The emerging ADAS tech trend, which is still also a major USP for volume models, is expected to see a penetration level of 3% in the 4 million units Indian PV market, and around 5-6% in 2025, with the PV market clocking about 4.6 million units, according to market research firm Markets and Markets. The adoption level was around 2% in 2023.Automotive business intelligence firm Jato Dynamics\u2019 granular research shows standard rear parking distance sensor (52%), standard rear parking distance sensor & camera (47%), and auto activation hazard lights (39%) as the top three driving assistance features in terms of their industry penetration rate in India. On the Connected Vehicle tech side, remote services (29%), remote HVAC (16%), and remote start (7%), are listed as the leading ones.Mahindra & Mahindra, and MG Motor India (now JSW MG Motor India) are the lead players in the volume PV market when it comes to building businesses based on a strategy of democratising technology. The latter, which leveraged the Connected Vehicle and ADAS trends for brand MG\u2019s India market introduction, cites a projection that vehicles with advanced connected features will have an over 55% share by Q1 of 2027. And, vehicles with ADAS tech are expected to have an approximately 10% share.With these two major trends on the rise, Gaurav Gupta , Chief Growth Officer, JSW MG Motor India, says \u201cI will not be surprised if more than 80 % of customers would like to have a connected car. And, by 2030, we expect more than 30% new launches to have some level of ADAS.\u201dTechnology is increasingly becoming a crucial part in the savvy Indian consumer's vehicle purchase decision. \"Awareness has increased dramatically. Today customers decide their vehicle purchase within 3 main parameters Comfort, Safety, and Convenience. Comfort related to seating, Safety related to NCAP rating, and Convenience related to Connected Vehicle tech,\" says Kaushik Madhavan, VP - Automotive and Transportation, Markets and Markets.According to Gollagunta, the industry trend of ADAS is proving to be more than democratising technology. \u201cIt's democratising tech in our minds and bringing the volume up. But the second thing is, customers were looking at it as a safety feature (like the 360-degree camera view). The growing consumer awareness, and demand for ADAS has led M&M to \u2018democratise\u2019 the tech, by offering it in its compact SUV 3XO, and in all the AX variants of the Thar Roxx.The XUV700, launched in August \u201821, was the first Mahindra model to offer ADAS, in its top two variants. In the coming year or so, ADAS tech could become standard across all Mahindra models and variants as the solution also becomes more affordable with suppliers leveraging the economy of scale.2025 will see OEMs pushing the ADAS and connected tech envelopes even further. For example, M&M\u2019s \u2018electric origin\u2019 SUVs \u2013 BE 6 and XEV 9e, scheduled for launch in February, will have five radars to assist a more advanced tech suite. The OEM\u2019s ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) models with ADAS tech have one each.It\u2019s not only ADAS and Connected Vehicle tech that vehicles will rely on to woo customers in 2025. Display technology will also flex its muscle with different offerings to the driver, and other occupants in the vehicle. It\u2019s already beginning to happen. \u201cThe next battlefield in some form or shape, and it\u2019s already happening right now, is the amount of screen real estate which is there in each car,\u201d says Gollagunta.Like luxury cars, volume PV models will increasingly have more screens in the instrument panel/dashboard, and also offer screens for rear seat occupants. Global display technology major Visteon\u2019s CEO Sachin Lawande says, \u201cEvery car will have at least one large display, more likely two, if not more.\u201d For example, the upcoming Mahindra EVs will come with three screens, in their pillar-to-pillar display unit. Another two can be for the rear passengers.This growing trend of advanced display technology also makes Visteon see India as a 10 million unit automotive display market of display sizes 10 inches and higher, by the end of this decade.The growing global AI wave is also set to influence the in-car experience now. In the battle for customers\u2019 attention and interest, Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) will see major usage by OEMs in 2025. Especially to enhance the user experience. As Lawande puts it, \u201cAI is the new UI\u201d. The software driven technology can be almost revolutionary. \u201cThink about everything that you are currently doing with the system in the car, enhanced through AI,\u201d says the global industry leader.After Connected Vehicle tech, which is getting enhanced with 5G connectivity, and ADAS, Gollagunta counts AI as the third dimension of new automotive trends, which will also see major gains in 2025. \u201cVehicles will start to have a lot more augmented reality and AI capabilities built in,\u201d he says, and cites the example of heads-up display (HUD) with augmented reality in the Mahindra BE 6. AI for cameras in the vehicle, for facial recognition, driver drowsiness etc. will also see adoption in volume passenger vehicle models.As much as there the Indian market may offer great opportunity, thanks to its hunger for new technology, industry players will have to also meet the additional cost challenge that new technology usually comes with.\u201cNext year is going to be a year of consolidation, meaning that the inflation that has happened in costs, in getting here, whether it is battery costs, electronics cost, displays costs, we need to be able to drive strategies to make this cost become more affordable, so that the promise of the growth that we are all expecting can actually be delivered,\u201d says Lawande.To ride the India opportunity better, and also leverage the country\u2019s competitive production costs, Visteon looks to strike a collaboration or two with partners here for local production of its display products.Collaboration as a business growth or technology development strategy will see more traction in 2025. According to Raghavendra Vaidya , MD and CEO, Daimler Trucks Innovation Center, Daimler Truck\u2019s GCC (Global Capability Center) in India, collaboration across industries is set to be a major force driving India\u2019s automotive evolution, with strategic partnerships accelerating advancements in EV infrastructure, autonomous driving, and next-generation mobility solutions.He also adds that a significant emerging trend is the willingness of leading automotive companies to advance the development of cutting-edge software platforms, enhance vehicle connectivity, and build an integrated digital ecosystem.All the advanced automotive technology features that are beginning to emerge, and more to come in 2025 and beyond, will be enabled only by the software defined vehicle (SDV). This trend will also help OEMs to be more cost effective, while also helping democratise technology as multiple features can be based on the same software platform/architecture.If consumers lap up more software defined vehicles, the better it would be for both the buyers and vehicle manufacturers. \u201cThe more volume you get, you actually get more competitive and therefore technology democratisation, while it's good for customers, it's also good for us,\u201d says Gollagunta.Lawande expects softwarisation, along with digitalisation and electrification to gain more traction in 2025.With all the fares lined up for 2025, some already showcased, and more to come up in events next year, staring with the international mela of Bharat Mobility Expo, scheduled for 17-22 January, industry players would be hoping for a good drive in the coming year.,"

            "article_content": "Image: Cottonbro studio / Pexels\n\nThe convergence of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, as demonstrated by the meteoric rise of meme tokens like Pepe Coin, is ushering in a new era of decentralized computing that promises to democratize access to advanced machine learning capabilities. This revolutionary combination is not just changing how AI models are trained and deployed \u2013 it's fundamentally transforming the economic landscape of technological innovation.\n\nAs we examine this technological synergy more closely, it becomes clear how decentralized systems are reshaping the traditional power structures in AI development.\n\nThe Foundation of Decentralized AI\n\nTech giants with vast computing resources and proprietary datasets have long dominated traditional AI development. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have maintained a virtual monopoly on advanced AI capabilities, creating a significant barrier to entry for smaller players and independent researchers. However, the introduction of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency incentives is rapidly changing this paradigm.\n\nDecentralized machine learning platforms leverage blockchain's distributed nature to create vast networks of computing power. These networks function like a global supercomputer, where participants can contribute their unused computing resources in exchange for cryptocurrency tokens. This model not only makes AI development more accessible but also more efficient and cost-effective.\n\nThe Economic Incentive Model\n\nThe brilliance of combining cryptocurrency with decentralized AI lies in its economic incentive structure. Participants in these networks are rewarded with native tokens for contributing resources, whether that's computing power, data, or AI models. This creates a positive feedback loop where:\n\nContributors are incentivized to provide more resources to the network Developers gain access to affordable computing power and datasets Users benefit from increasingly sophisticated AI services The overall ecosystem grows in value as more participants join\n\nNetwork participants can earn tokens by providing various resources:\n\nComputing power for training AI models\n\nStorage space for distributed datasets\n\nHigh-quality data for training purposes\n\nValidated AI models ready for deployment\n\nVerification services for ensuring data quality\n\nTechnical Infrastructure and Implementation\n\nThe technical architecture of these platforms typically consists of several key components. Smart contracts manage the distribution of computational tasks and token rewards, ensuring transparent and automatic execution of agreements between parties. Distributed storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) handle the massive datasets required for AI training, while blockchain networks maintain an immutable record of transactions and model provenance.\n\nFederated learning techniques are often employed to train AI models across distributed networks without centralizing sensitive data. This approach allows multiple parties to contribute to model development while maintaining data privacy and reducing bandwidth requirements.\n\nChallenges and Future Developments\n\nDespite the promising potential, decentralized AI platforms face several challenges that need to be addressed for widespread adoption:\n\nSecurity concerns remain paramount, as distributed networks must protect against malicious actors while maintaining performance. Platform developers are implementing sophisticated verification mechanisms and reputation systems to ensure network integrity.\n\nScalability presents another significant challenge, as blockchain networks must handle the massive computational requirements of AI training while maintaining reasonable transaction speeds and costs. Layer-2 solutions and improved consensus mechanisms are being developed to address these limitations.\n\nThe regulatory landscape around both cryptocurrency and AI remains uncertain in many jurisdictions, potentially affecting platform development and adoption. Industry leaders are actively engaging with regulators to establish clear frameworks that protect users while fostering innovation.\n\nImpact on the AI Industry\n\nThe rise of decentralized machine learning platforms is democratizing access to AI technology in unprecedented ways. Small businesses and independent researchers can now access computing resources and datasets that were previously available only to large corporations. This democratization is leading to the following:\n\nIncreased diversity in AI development and applications\n\nMore rapid innovation through collaborative development\n\nLower barriers to entry for AI startups\n\nGreater competition in the AI services market\n\nImproved transparency in AI model development\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe future of decentralized AI platforms appears bright, with several emerging trends likely to shape the industry:\n\nEdge computing integration will enable more efficient processing of AI tasks by leveraging distributed computing resources closer to data sources. This will reduce latency and improve real-time applications.\n\nCross-chain interoperability will allow AI resources to be shared across different blockchain networks, creating a more connected and efficient ecosystem. This will enable greater flexibility in resource allocation and token utilization.\n\nAs these platforms mature, we can expect to see increasingly sophisticated applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and scientific research. The combination of blockchain's security and transparency with AI's analytical capabilities creates possibilities for solving complex problems in ways previously not possible.\n\nThe convergence of blockchain and AI through decentralized machine learning platforms represents a significant shift in how we develop and deploy artificial intelligence. By democratizing access to AI resources and creating economic incentives for participation, these platforms are fostering a new era of collaborative innovation that promises to accelerate technological progress while making it more accessible to all."

Caitlin Doornbos/NY Post\n\nI hoped to take a break from the war along the way to share the stories of Christians making their pilgrimages to the Holy Land.\n\nBut when I arrived at the holiest sites where Jesus was born, preached, died \u2013 from Bethlehem and Nazareth to the Sea of Galilee and Jerusalem \u2014 the only Christian I found was myself.\n\nThe discovery was yet another sobering reminder of the ongoing war in the region, but it also served to reinforce the hope of the season: peace on earth.\n\nBethlehem\n\nAncient Bethlehem lies in the West Bank, in an area where the Israeli government bans its citizens from entering. To visit, you cross a checkpoint manned by Israel Defense Force soldiers pointing rifles at all who enter in case a terrorist attack should break out.\n\nImmediately upon entering, music indicating Muslim prayer time blast from speakers across town. On the run-down streets that could come from a scene in the Disney movie \u201cAladdin,\u201d paintings of young Palestinian \u201cmartyrs\u201d carrying AK-47s remind visitors of the nonstop religious war in Israel.\n\n6 The holy sites are contained mostly to what\u2019s known as \u201cthe Old City\u201d of Jerusalem. Caitlin Doornbos/NY Post\n\nWhile hatred for Jewish Israelis in Bethlehem is evident, the town thrives off the dollars of Christian tourists who once poured into the town by the millions.\n\nBut since Israel\u2019s war with Hamas broke out after the terror group\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre of more than 1,200 Israelis on the other side of the country, tourism is just a fraction of what it had been.

While restaurants have a few customers here and there, the beloved shops carrying images of Jesus hand-carved from olive wood are dead silent \u2014 with business worse than it was during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my first customer this week,\u201d Bethlehem shopkeeper Nadir Nasser told me as I purchased handmade rosaries for my family back home. \u201cThe nativity sets have been 50% off for more than a year, and I still can\u2019t move them.\u201d\n\nMy tour guide, Youseff, told me on our walk to the Church of the Nativity that I was his first English-speaking visitor during the season.\n\n\u201cMost have been coming from the region \u2014 India is about as far as I\u2019ve seen people come from lately,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even they weren\u2019t Christian.\u201d\n\n6 Where Bethlehem saw about 2 million tourists a year before the conflict, officials estimate only about 100,000 visitors came to the holy city in 2024. Caitlin Doornbos/NY Post\n\nInstead of pilgrimages, what little tourism that has come to Bethlehem over the past 14 months of the war has involved mostly non-Israeli history buffs from neighboring countries.\n\nInside the church, I saw a handful of other tourists. Looking forward to hearing their stories of making the Christmastime pilgrimage despite the war, I approached each English-speaking person I could find to ask for an interview. But none of the 12 individuals I found inside said they were Christian.\n\nStill, they were interested in learning the ancient landmark\u2019s history and traditions, including involving the space said to be the site of the original wooden manger where Jesus was born.\n\nNazareth and the Sea of Gallilee\n\nUnlike Bethlehem, Nazareth \u2014 where Jesus was raised \u2014 is part of Israel proper. It is also home to the largest concentration of Muslims and Arab Israelis in the nation.\n\n6 Unlike Bethlehem, Nazareth \u2014 where Jesus was raised \u2014 is part of Israel proper. It is also home to the largest concentration of Muslims and Arab Israelis in the nation. Caitlin Doornbos/NY Post\n\nThe streets were bustling with locals \u2014 both Jews and Muslims \u2014 on their way home from school and work as I ventured into town.\n\nBut I soon found myself alone as I approached one of the main holy sites in Nazareth, known as Mary\u2019s Well.\n\nBelieved to be where the angel Gabriel visited Mary to tell her she would bear the son of God, the \u201cwell\u201d could now otherwise be mistaken for a dry, rundown park fountain.\n\nI sat there alone for about half an hour, reflecting on the dual beauty and sadness of having such a sacred place all to myself. If there\u2019s one thing to be said for religious tourism in a war zone, it\u2019s that it teaches you to be grateful for the little moments.\n\nLater, I drove about 18 miles away to Tiberius, Israel \u2014 home to the Sea of Galilee, where Christians believe Jesus walked on water.\n\n6 Doornbos capped off her pilgrimage in Jerusalem. Caitlin Doornbos/NY Post\n\nOnce a hotspot for pilgrims, Tiberius now looks like a resort town in winter \u2014 with heavy construction at nearly all of the hotels, where most of the rooms sit empty.\n\nI also visited the nearby Capernaum National Park, once home to the Jewish fishing village where Jesus first began his ministry. But instead of pilgrims, the few people I found there were nature enthusiasts taking in the rich and diverse landscape of the area on the banks of the Sea of Galilee with the mountains of Jordan perched in the distance.\n\nJerusalem\n\nI capped off my pilgrimage in Jerusalem, which was territorially split in half between Israel and the West Bank as part of the Oslo Accords of 1995.\n\nThe holy sites are contained mostly to what\u2019s known as \u201cthe Old City,\u201d which is cordoned off into four sections: the Muslim, Jewish, Christian and Armenian quarters.\n\n6 Jerusalem was territorially split in half between Israel and the West Bank as part of the Oslo Accords of 1995. Caitlin Doornbos/NY Post\n\nBecause the site is important to so many different faiths, I found Jerusalem to be less deserted than the other holy sites I visited. Jews still flocked to the Jewish quarter\u2019s Western Wall, the remains of the retaining structure surrounding the Temple Mount \u2014 where the first and second Temples of Jerusalem were built and destroyed in 587 BC and 70 CE, respectively.\n\nWhile non-Muslims are not allowed in parts of the Muslim quarter, there are some markets in the area that are open to visitors. The ancient streets that were open to me bustled with business from visitors to the Islamic sites.\n\nLocal shop owners, hungry for customers, greeted me cheerfully throughout the Old City, convincing me to come into their stores to purchase Christmas presents for my family.\n\nI spent about $250 in one store, purchasing some ancient Roman glass jewelry at a ridiculously reduced rate because of the lack of business. The shopkeeper, Asif Hassan, thanked me profusely, noting that the amount was more than he\u2019d made in the entire month.\n\nThe Christian quarter was quiet, like so many of the Christian sites I toured previously. Walking the same streets where Jesus was condemned to death by Pontius Pilate, the hushed atmosphere seemed almost mournful in a place that once saw some of the most tourism in the area.\n\nUpon entering the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, I finally found a few Christian tourists. Two knelt at the slab of rock where Jesus\u2019 body was believed to have been anointed before his burial and kissed the artifact in intense prayer.\n\nUp the stairs and around the corner, I found about a dozen more people \u2014 some kneeling and weeping in front of an elaborate altar.\n\nI joined them, taking my place underneath a huge display of Christ on the cross, not sure of the signifigance of where I was. Without many English speakers around \u2014 and no English signage \u2014 I knew whatever happened there must have been important by the reactions of others.\n\nLater, a Hebrew-speaking friend who joined me on my visit explained that I had just prayed at the site of Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\nAround the corner, I came upon Jesus\u2019 tomb, where Christians believe he rose from the dead three days after he was buried there.\n\nThe site was nearly as empty as it was when Mary Magdalene is said to have discovered Jesus\u2019 body was missing.\n\nThere, I finally recognized the gift it had been to have these holy sites almost entirely to myself this Christmas season. I knelt there inside Jesus\u2019 tomb, praying for an end to the war that had brought me to the country."

            "article_content": "Far from the front lines, Ukrainians fight a war to preserve their culture\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a remote region of western Ukraine, far from where the violent conflict of war with Russia is taking place and destroying human lives, Ukrainians are fighting a different type of battle: for culture and dignity. In this area of Transcarpathia, a historical region in Eastern Europe that is now primarily part of modern-day Ukraine, there are local residents holding onto their history, traditional lifestyle, crafts and cultural identity. After coming under threat during Soviet times, they face stark new dangers. Since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainians have feared that he is determined to wipe out their culture and statehood. Millions of Ukrainians have left the country. Many others have joined the army \u2014 with many killed on the front lines \u2014 and war efforts have soaked up people's energy and resources. As they defend their territory from advancing Russian forces, many in Ukraine are also fighting to preserve a cultural heritage in peril. Like many in this region, Joseph Bartosh, 67, believes he's fighting on a sort of cultural front line. \"In 2000,\" Bartosh says, \"my war actually started that year.\" That was when Bartosh started his effort to preserve the medieval St. Miklos Castle in the town of Chynadiiovo, Ukraine. When he began the project, the castle was in disrepair. He says he found signs that in Soviet times, it had been used as a horse stable, with a lack of respect given to its history. With the restoration well underway, the inside has already been transformed into a space for art exhibitions, community events and a museum where people can learn about the castle's history. During this visit by NPR, the Transcarpathian Folk Choir is performing in the castle's yard and filming for a music video, as Bartosh closes up for the day. There are instances throughout Ukraine's history in which the people were spurred into action to preserve their culture. Villagers here remember the Soviet history of Ukraine as a time of erasure of unique regional traditions. Hanna Haiduk recalls her relatives having to hide their embroidered shirts, called a vyshyvanka, to save them from being destroyed by Soviet troops. \"People were putting [vyshyvankas] inside of glass jars, sealing those jars, digging holes underground trying to hide those vyshyvankas there. And people were trying to save vyshyvanka for years for the next generations in this way,\" Haiduk recounts over tea in her kitchen.\n\nHaiduk, 60, is from the Hutsul ethnic group, from a village in the Carpathian Mountains called Kosivska. She remembers learning to embroider as a child, alongside her whole community. They would often gather under one large tree in the village to work on communal projects, chatting and laughing together as she and other kids would help, and learning different embroidery techniques as their parents directed them. They embroidered towels, rugs and vyshyvankas. Haiduk passed her love of tradition to her eldest son, Taras. He was a tour guide, showing off regional culture to people from around the world. He was killed while serving in the Ukrainian army, just one month after the war began in 2022, at age 34. He was supportive of her work and, before his death, he was building a website for Haiduk, to help her sell her vyshyvankas. But he never got to finish it, she says. She recounts all this with tears in her eyes. \"The war touches everywhere in this country; it's a misconception that we are free from it here,\" Haiduk says. But not every part of the region's cultural heritage has been successfully preserved, as the war has taken its toll. Richka is known locally as the village that makes hunias, traditional fluffy wool coats. Olha Mys and her mother and sisters used to make hunias, but the tradition is dying out. Even before the war, Mys says, fewer people were producing and wearing hunias because of how time-consuming and meticulous it is to make them.\n\n\"It's not easy work to do this,\" Mys says. Making a hunia takes months just to complete one coat. After gathering the sheep's wool, it is washed and dried in the sun, then combed and woven on a loom that takes up an entire room. The woven fabric is then washed for multiple hours in a valylo, a kind of natural washing machine that people construct on the side of a mountain stream. Valylos can only be used when the stream is very full and the water runs clear to keep dirt out of the materials. The hours of washing in the valylo helps with felting the woven fabric, creating a material that is dense and spongy. Adding to the difficulties, the war has shrunk the population of Richka, as people have fled Ukraine altogether. Many people in the village, roughly counting their neighbors, estimate that over half have left since the war started nearly three years ago. Lubov Hychka, who still occasionally makes hunias, says that this population drop affects the materials she needs for the process. \"All those people that left because of the war, many of them had sheep, even despite the fact they weren't producing hunias,\" Hychka says. \"When they left they sold their sheep or rented them to people in other villages, in other areas. Now if you want to start to produce hunia, you don't have this amount of choice [in wool].\"\n\nTraditionally, large flocks of sheep used to ramble through the Carpathian Mountains, spending summers on wide alpine meadows while shepherds lived alongside them. Now they dot the area, with usually just a few nibbling on grasses together on the outskirts of each village. Mikhailo Bilak, a man wearing knee-high mud boots, watches over his flock of more than a hundred sheep. He says he and his friend, Mykola Yakbuk, are some of the rare shepherds who still raise sheep in this way, grazing them near the village of Yavoriv. Even on this remote mountaintop, the war still looms. At 59, Bilak has nearly aged out of the military draft, which goes up to 60, but the country's mobilization remains a threat. \"Pretty much if they mobilize me, these sheep will be packed immediately for slaughterhouse. Nobody will take care of them,\" Bilak says bluntly, before he runs after his moving flock down the mountain, waving goodbye and apologizing at the hasty exit. A few villages away in Krasnoillya, a small wooden museum is tucked into a valley that curls around a flowing stream, between the pine-covered peaks of the mountains. In the museum, actors who perform Hutsul theater are having a modest feast after rehearsal. A variety of cured meats and cheeses are stacked on thick, buttered slices of white bread."

            "article_content": "Sean Williams\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nIn less than four weeks, President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 47th president and become only the second U.S. leader to ever serve nonconsecutive terms. However, Wall Street decided to kick off the party a bit early.\n\nSince Election Day, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500 and growth stock-dependent Nasdaq have all ascended to record-closing highs. This is a continuation of the robust gains Wall Street's major indexes enjoyed during Trump's first term. Between Jan. 20, 2017 and Jan. 20, 2021, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite soared 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\n\nBut to quote Wall Street's favorite warning: \"Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\"\n\nAlthough stocks thrived with Trump in the Oval Office, there's genuine concern that his desire to implement tariffs on Day One could undermine American businesses and cause the stock market to plunge. Based on what history tell us, this isn't out of the realm of possibilities.\n\nTrump's prior tariffs had a harmful effect on stocks\n\nLast month, President-elect Trump laid out his plan to impose a 25% tariff on imports from its direct neighbors, Canada and Mexico, as well as 35% tariff on imported goods from China, the world's No. 2 economy.\n\nThe general purpose of tariffs is to make American-made goods more price-competitive with those being brought in from beyond our borders. They're also designed to encourage multinational businesses to manufacture their goods destined for the U.S. within the confines of our borders.\n\nBut according to an analysis from Liberty Street Economics, which publishes research for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Trump's tariffs have previously had a decisively negative impact on U.S. equities exposed to countries where those tariffs were targeted.\n\nThe four authors of Do Import Tariffs Protect U.S. Firms? make it a point to distinguish between the impacts of tariffs on outputs versus inputs. An output tariff is an added cost placed on the final price of a good, such as a car imported into the country. Meanwhile, an input tariff would affect the cost of producing a final good (e.g., higher costs on imported steel). The authors note that higher input tariffs make it difficult for U.S. manufacturers to compete on price with foreign businesses.\n\nThe authors also examined the stock market returns of all publicly traded U.S. companies on the day Trump announced tariffs in 2018 and 2019. They found a clear negative shift in equity prices on the days tariffs were announced, with this effect being most pronounced on businesses that were exposed to China.\n\nFurthermore, the authors noted a correlation between companies that performed poorly on tariff announcement days and \"future real outcomes.\" Specifically, these businesses experienced declines in profits, employment, sales, and labor productivity from 2019 through 2021, based on the authors' calculations.\n\nIn other words, history would suggest that tariffs being implemented on Day One of Donald Trump's second term can be a downside catalyst for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite.\n\nStocks are pricey, raising concerns about a correction\n\nUnfortunately, history has a bit of a double whammy for investors. While comparing the historic performance of equities on tariff announcement days during Trump's first term provides a limited data set, one of Wall Street's top valuation indicators, which can be back-tested 153 years, offers ample reason for concern.\n\nIn other words, there's another reason for investors to be nervous about the market besides tariffs: Stock valuations are relatively high.\n\nA lot of investors are probably familiar with the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which divides a publicly traded company's share price into its trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS). The traditional P/E ratio is a fairly effective valuation tool that helps investors determine if a stock is cheap or expensive relative to its peers and the broad-market indexes.\n\nThe downside to the P/E ratio is that can be easily disrupted by shock events. For instance, lockdowns that occurred during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic rendered the trailing-12-month EPS relatively useless for most companies for about a year.\n\nThis is where the S&P 500's Shiller P/E Ratio, which is also known as the cyclically adjusted P/E Ratio (CAPE Ratio), can come in handy.\n\nS&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nThe Shiller P/E Ratio is based on average inflation-adjusted EPS from the previous 10 years. Looking at a decade's worth of inflation-adjusted earnings data makes shock events something of a moot point when assessing the valuation of equities, as a whole.\n\nAs of the closing bell on Dec. 20, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E sat at 37.68, which is more than double its 153-year average of 17.19. But what's more worrisome is how the stock market has responded following previous instances where the Shiller P/E has topped 30.\n\nWhat happens when stock prices are high?\n\nDating back to January 1871, there have only been six instances where the S&P 500's Shiller P/E crested 30 during a bull market rally, including the present. Each prior occurrence was eventually followed by a 20% to 89% decline in the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and/or Nasdaq Composite.\n\nTo be clear, the Shiller P/E doesn't give us any clues as to when stock market downturns will begin. Sometimes stocks have extended valuations for a matter of weeks before tumbling, such as the two-month stretch preceding the start of the Great Depression in 1929. Meanwhile, the Shiller P/E topped 30 for four years prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. Nevertheless, this historic valuation metric suggests stocks can plunge -- and it would have made no difference which presidential candidate won in November.\n\nStock investing for the long haul usually works out\n\nHowever, history can be a beacon of hope and inspiration, too, depending on your investment horizon.\n\nNo matter how much investors would prefer to do away with stock market corrections, bear markets, and crashes, they're ultimately a normal and inevitable aspect of the investing cycle. But what's important to note is that the ups and downs associated with investing aren't linear.\n\nFor example, the analysts at Bespoke Investment Group calculated the average calendar-day length of S&P 500 bull and bear markets since the beginning of the Great Depression and discovered night-and-day differences between the two.\n\nOn one hand, the 27 S&P 500 bear markets between Sept. 1929 and June 2023 averaged just 286 calendar days (around 9.5 months), with the longest bear market clocking in at 630 calendar days. On the other side of the coin, the typical S&P 500 bull market endured 1,011 calendar days over the 94 years examined. Further, 14 out of 27 bull markets (if you include and extrapolate the current bull market to present day) have stuck around longer than the lengthiest bear market.\n\n^SPX data by YCharts. YCharts S&P 500 return data begins in 1950.\n\nAn analysis from Crestmont Research looked back even further on the performance of equities over long periods and came to an even more encouraging conclusion.\n\nCrestmont calculated the rolling 20-year total returns (including dividends) of the S&P 500 since the start of the 20th century. Even though the S&P didn't officially exist until 1923, researchers were able to track the performance of its components in other indexes to satisfy its back-test to 1900. This 20-year hold timeline produced 105 ending periods (1919 through 2023).\n\nWhat Crestmont's annually updated data set shows is that all 105 rolling 20-year periods would have generated a positive total return. Hypothetically speaking, if you had purchased an S&P 500 index fund just prior to the start of the Great Depression in 1929, or before Black Monday in 1987, and held that stake for 20 years, you'd have still made money.\n\nCrestmont Research's data set also conclusively shows that the stock market can make patient investors richer regardless of which political party is in power. No matter how you arrange the political puzzle pieces, 20-year total returns have always been decisively positive.\n\nSean Williams has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

To that end, specialized semiconductors are used to speed up computationally intensive AI tasks.\n\nIn that semiconductor vertical, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) have emerged as the industry standard. In fact, the company has between 80% and 95% market share in AI accelerators, according to analysts. But Nvidia shareholders recently got some worrisome news from rival Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO).\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nNvidia shareholders just got some bad news from Broadcom\n\nBroadcom sells a range of semiconductor products, including combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips in Apple and Samsung smartphones, as well as networking chips in Arista switches. But Wall Street is particularly fascinated by its leadership in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs.) ASICs are chips purpose-built for specific use cases like accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\n\nAnalysts estimate Broadcom has approximately 60% market share in custom AI chips due to its relationships with three hyperscalers, a term that refers to companies with vast data center footprints. While Broadcom has not identified its hyperscale customers, analysts generally believe they are Google parent Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok parent ByteDance.\n\nBroadcom estimates revenue from its three existing hyperscale customers will range from $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027, up from $12.2 billion in 2024. In other words, the company anticipates that custom AI chip sales will increase at least 70% annually in the next three years, but perhaps as quickly as 95% annually.\n\nThat is disappointing for Nvidia shareholders because it means Broadcom will likely gain market share in AI accelerators. In fact, analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that ASICs will account for 13% of AI accelerator sales in 2027, up from 11% in 2024. They also think that figure could hit 15% in 2030. But there is more bad news for Nvidia shareholders.\n\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan told analysts on the fourth-quarter earnings call that Broadcom has selected two new hyperscalers that are likely to be revenue-generating customers by 2027. That means revenue from custom AI chips could actually grow faster than 95% annually in the next few years. Importantly, while Broadcom did not identify the customers, analysts believe they are Apple and ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nA semiconductor underlit by gold light, with glowing letters AI on its face.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia shareholders still have good reason to be optimistic\n\nI mentioned that Broadcom selected two additional hyperscalers as potential customers. CEO Hock Tan himself used that word because Broadcom will not develop ASICs for small companies, nor would small companies have an interest in using custom AI chips.\n\nThere are two reasons for that. First, designing ASICs is expensive, so the customer must have a data center footprint large enough to warrant the expense. Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar recently told CNBC that each chip costs about $500 million to design, so it would not be financially sensible to work with clients that can only order a few thousand. Instead, orders must be in the range of 250,000 to 500,000 units.\n\nSecond, custom chips are less flexible because they are designed for specific workloads and lack supporting software development tools. Nvidia offers a robust ecosystem of code libraries and pretrained models that streamline GPU application development. No such tools exist for ASICs. That means deploying custom chips requires a high degree of technical expertise, which means Broadcom's customer base is limited.\n\nAdditionally, companies that experiment with ASICs may ultimately decide the costs outweigh the benefits. Antoine Chkaiban at New Street Research says only two companies have deployed custom AI silicon at scale: Google and Amazon. So Nvidia is well positioned to maintain its leadership in AI accelerators. Bank of America analysts estimate it will capture 75% market share in 2030, down only slightly from 80% in 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street thinks Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase at 34% annually through fiscal 2027, which ends in January 2027. That consensus makes the current valuation of 53 times adjusted earnings look very reasonable. Prospective investors can buy a few shares with confidence, and current shareholders have good reason to optimistic going forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "article_content": "Although Americans may have significantly less carpeting in their homes than in decades past, the need for vacuum cleaners has remained.\n\n\"What we're hearing, people are gravitating more toward hard surfaces with area rugs, but area rugs are actually why vacuuming remains so prevalent,\" said Julien Levesque, senior vice president of product at SharkNinja, a maker of vacuums and home appliances. \"The other piece is people are getting more comfortable with the notion of using a vacuum on a hard floor where maybe in the past they were worried about a product damaging their floors.\"\n\nSo, whether you have hardwood flooring or carpets, a vacuum cleaner would likely make a welcome addition to your home. But what kind of vacuum is best for your home? It'll likely come down to a choice between an upright or stick vacuum, and the answer will vary according to your home size, whether you have kids or pets and what features you're looking for.\n\nThis is only two days worth of dog hair my Dyson can suction up on its highest suction setting from a 500 square foot section of carpet. Katie Collins/CNET\n\nWhat is an upright vacuum?\n\nAn upright vacuum has that name because all its key components -- including the brush head, motor, dust container -- all feature on the same unit, which can stand upright when not in use. Examples include the Hoover Windtunnel and Bissell PowerForce Helix. To clean, the user bends an upright vacuum toward themselves and rolls the brush head over surfaces to pick up dirt and other debris.\n\nTypically, upright vacuums must be plugged into an electrical outlet to function, although battery-powered uprights are now coming onto the market. Compared to stick vacuums, uprights typically are heavier and bulkier (around 15 pounds), but provide more suction power and larger dirt canisters or bags. Upright vacuums typically feature additional accessories that will help you clean in a variety of situations, from high edges to under furniture.\n\nIn terms of pricing, the entry point into the upright vacuum category is cheaper than stick vacuums, but can be expensive on the higher end.\n\nShark\n\nPros and cons of an upright vacuum\n\nPros\n\nUpright vacuums are more powerful: These vacuums have more suction power than their stick counterparts, making them suitable for whole house cleanings or deep cleanings. Given their power, you may only have to vacuum a soiled area a few times as opposed to a stick vacuum.\n\nThey have larger dirt canisters: In addition to their suction power, which makes larger cleaning jobs easier, upright vacuums have more capacity to store dirt, dust, and other debris you're picking up from the floor. This means you won't have to empty that canister as often as you would with typically slimmer stick vacs.\n\nUpright vacuums are more versatile: These machines typically come equipped with various accessories that will simplify specific cleaning jobs. For example, pull out the house and attach the long nozzle to clean hard-to-reach places, or use the pet-hair brush to pick up all your doggy or kitty's leftover fur. Some upright vacuums also come equipped with HEPA-sealed dirt canisters that prevent dirt and allergens such as pet fur from leaking out.\n\nCons\n\nThey're not quite portable: Given their bulkiness and need to be plugged into an electrical outlet, upright vacuums can be a bit of a pain to carry around the house, especially for houses with many stairs.\n\nYou'll need to use attachments for certain jobs: \"The biggest con on an upright vacuum is that you can't fit it underneath beds and other furniture,\" said Chris Kobrick, director of product management at vacuum maker Kenmore. \"You can't get it to be flat enough because the thickness of the unit itself doesn't allow for it to be able to push fully underneath a bed or something with a low braying to it.\"\n\nThey tend to be noisy: Given upright vacuums suction power, expect these machines to be noisy while in use.\n\nWhat is a stick vacuum?\n\nStick vacuums, as the name suggests, are long, thin vacuum cleaners, with the motor and dirt canister near the top and brush head on the bottom. While they're not as powerful as their upright counterparts, nor do they hold as much dirt, stick vacuums are comparatively lightweight -- under 10 pounds on average. They're also typically powered by a battery, like the Dyson V15 Detect and our current top pick for the best cordless vacuums, the LG CordZero. Starting prices for stick vacuums are generally higher than upright vacuums.\n\n\"Stick vacuums started out as more of a quick cleanup type of unit. They've gained in popularity. They're easy to use. They maneuver well,\" Kobrick said. Stick vacuums are for \"quick, easy, get it out, do that specific job as opposed to whole home cleaning. If you live in a small space and maybe don't have pets or kids, you could probably use a stick vacuum as your primary vacuum, but there are some limitations to it.\"\n\nBrian Bennett/CNET\n\nPros and cons of a stick vacuum\n\nPros\n\nStick vacuums are more portable and convenient: Because they are cordless and relatively lighter than uprights, stick vacuums are ideal for small, quick jobs. For example, you can keep it near your dining table and use it to quickly clean any messes the kids made during dinner.\n\nThey're also more maneuverable: Many of the stick vacuums on the market today are made to contort to fit in a variety of places, including under the bed and on stairs. By using different attachments, you can also reach high-up places and even on surfaces such as your couch.\n\nThey're easier to maintain: Compared to uprights, stick vacuums can be much simpler to clean. Typically, stick vacs feature dustbins that can be simply dumped into the garbage can after a few uses. They also have fewer filters to clean.\n\nCons\n\nStick vacuums need more frequent dumping: While it's also a perk, expect to take more trips with your stick vacuum to the garbage can to empty the dustbin, since they're typically smaller than in their upright counterparts.\n\nDon't expect to use it for big jobs: Stick vacuums are great for what they do -- cleaning up smaller areas and more concentrated messes -- but they don't have the suction power required for larger homes and deeper cleans.\n\nYou'll have to keep that battery charged: Along with the above, stick vacuums are also not suitable for big cleaning jobs because they run on batteries. Typically, you can expect up to 40 minutes of runtime on a full charge at lower suction settings.\n\nUpright vs. Stick Vacuum: Which one should you choose?\n\nWhile both types of vacuums use a motor to power a fan to generate airflow to pull dirt and other materials from surfaces, there are notable differences between upright and stick vacuums when it comes to their power source, suction power, portability, the size of the device as well as how much dirt they can hold.\n\nIn short, upright vacuums are more powerful machines typically plugged into an outlet and don't need to be emptied as often as stick vacuums, making them ideal for cleaning larger homes. Stick vacuums, on the other hand, are lighter, more portable devices typically powered by a rechargeable battery and used for a variety of quicker cleaning tasks.\n\nUpright vacuums remain the most popular on the market, with almost 56% market share of all units sold, while stick vacuums hold about 41% of the market, according to data shared by Chris Kobrick, director of product management at vacuum maker Kenmore (the canister vacuum is fading out of the market with less than 3% market share).\n\nThis is just one configuration. The Steva+ is also an upright mop and handheld vacuum and steamer. Nugeni\n\nUpright vs. Stick Vacuum: Factors to consider\n\nThe most important factor when considering between an upright and stick vacuum is the size of your home. Other factors include whether you have kids or pets, and what your expectations are for a vacuum cleaner.\n\n\"Stick vacs are great for their power and the cleanup. They work very well. The limitation of the battery is the biggest [drawback],\" Kobrick said. \"If you have a 2,000 square-foot home and a couple of kids, you would want a full upright with some attachments that can really give you the versatility to clean your home.\"\n\nEssentially, if you live in a smaller home and want to clean in quick bursts, a stick vacuum may work as your primary cleaning device. Those with messy pets who leave hair everywhere or children or with larger living spaces may want the power and versatility of an upright vacuum cleaner.\n\nYou don't need to limit yourself to one vacuum cleaner\n\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that many Americans own more than one vacuum cleaner. According to research from SharkNinja, Americans own an average of 2.3 vacuums, which could be a combination of upright and stick vacuums.\n\n\"People on the higher end of that [vacuum] average [have] one for every floor,\" Levesque said. \"Usually, there's a spare that's in the basement if something goes wrong with one of the other ones.\" He added that some people have a vacuum for their grossest messes, including highly trafficked carpets or where pets hang out the most.\n\nFAQs\n\nAre upright vacuums more powerful than stick vacuums? Yes, upright vacuums typically feature more powerful motors that allow them more suction power than stick vacuums. Uprights typically need to be plugged into an electrical outlet to compensate for this power, whereas many stick vacuums run off batteries.\n\nAre stick vacuums as good as upright vacuums? \"It's based on how you define 'good,'\" Kobrick said. \"[Stick vacuums] clean well for smaller areas. It comes down to the limitation of the battery and the battery length of time. An upright will overall do a better job. You get deeper cleaning and you have the power and the suction.\"\n\nWhich vacuum works best for pet hair? The safer choice for pet hair is an upright vacuum, given they offer more suction power. That said, a stick vacuum may work, but you may have to use it more often. Whatever choice you make, one useful feature for pet owners and those with long hair are self-cleaning brushrolls. Fur and hair often can get stuck around the vacuum's brush roll, forcing the user to remove it manually, often with a scissor. This feature prevents that issue, either with a built-in blade or comb system so that hair and fur doesn't clump up.\n\nRead more link stack"

            "article_content": "Although Russia has managed to avoid an economic collapse, its war with Ukraine and military involvement in Syria have negatively affected its economy.\n\nRussia\u2019s military intervention in Syria since 2015 has allowed it to assert its power, creating a misleading perception of Russia\u2019s military might. In contrast, Ukraine has dispelled that illusion and significantly injured its invaders.\n\nRussia\u2019s decade-long involvement in Syria has failed, much like its invasion of Ukraine. Although Russia\u2019s stature has declined, it will keep up the pretense.\n\nNow that the rebels have ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, they have also exposed Russia\u2019s fragility and difficulty supporting its client states such as neighboring Belarus. This turn of events will undoubtedly change the geopolitical landscape, particularly affecting Iran, which is providing Russia with drones. That bodes well for Israel.\n\nDuring the Arab Spring in 2011, people rose up and ousted the leaders of Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen. However, Russia protected Syria, enabling Assad to remain in power. Russia has also benefited, gaining a foothold in the Middle East and establishing two military bases. The country has invested heavily in Syria by deploying troops, conducting airstrikes and providing economic support \u2014 money down the tubes. Russia has given refuge to Assad, and even Russia\u2019s state-controlled media can\u2019t hide that dark reality.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama has described Russia as little more than a large gas station with nuclear weapons, suggesting that its influence is mainly regional \u2014 thinking with which President Joe Biden agrees.\n\nUkraine has underscored this critique by stating that Russia cannot effectively fight on two fronts and that Ukraine\u2019s military efforts have significantly weakened Russia\u2019s capacity to exert international influence. This experience serves as a warning to other countries that they cannot rely on Russia. To engage in the conflict with Ukraine, Russia must dedicate all of its workforce and weaponry.\n\nMoreover, Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy symbolize the quest for sovereignty and the defense of democracy, aligning themselves with the rebels who overthrew Assad and, by extension, opposed Russia\u2019s presence in Syria. At the same time, Ukraine highlights Russia\u2019s alleged war crimes, drawing parallels to its actions in Syria, particularly the indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians.\n\nKyiv portrays itself as the bulwark against Russian imperialism and the \u201ciron curtain\u201d \u2014 an ironic label \u2014 to prevent further aggression. Any Russian notion that it could remake the Soviet Union and relive its \u201cglory days\u201d is an illusion: Ukraine and Syria are perfect illustrations.\n\nRussia is a declining power struggling to maintain its ambitions beyond its borders.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the world welcomed Russia into the international fold. But Vladimir Putin\u2019s rise to power in 2000 has gradually reversed progress to the point where his regime has imprisoned more political prisoners than Leonid Brezhnev in the 1970s.\n\n\u201cToday, Russia respects neither borders nor human rights. There are no free media or honest elections,\u201d said Poland\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Radek Sikorski, at a December meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\n\u201cIt proved too difficult to emerge from their own political culture. Russia\u2019s rulers chose the path of aggressive, repressive kleptocracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not taken in by your lies, and we know what you are doing. You are trying to rebuild the Russian empire. We will not let you. We will resist you every inch of the way. You are successful in destroying Ukraine. But you are also destroying the future of your own country.\u201d\n\nAlthough Russia has managed to avoid an economic collapse, its war with Ukraine and military involvement in Syria have negatively affected its economy. The country\u2019s national wealth supports its war efforts \u2014 rather than building its economy.\n\nAdditionally, Western nations and their allies have imposed extensive sanctions on Russia\u2019s banking, energy and military industries, restricting its ability to obtain essential technologies.\n\nHistorically, Russia\u2019s energy exports have provided economic muscle. However, Europe, which has relied on Russian oil and gas, is now imposing a boycott on these resources. While it directs some of this energy to China and India, Russia sells it at discounted prices. Consequently, Russia is experiencing inflation and a shortage of goods.\n\nRussia has drained its coffers, and Assad\u2019s fall has further damaged its reputation. Indeed, the emperor has no clothes \u2014 a cautionary tale for other aligned leaders in Iran, North Korea and Belarus.\n\nKen Silverstein has covered energy and the environment for years.

            "article_content": "Right from generative AI models to hybrid cloud deployments, HPCL is marrying innovation with pragmatism to tackle modern-day digital challenges of data security, scalability, and cost optimization.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nJayant Gupta, Executive Director of Information Systems at HPCL, has an exclusive conversation- talking about the company\u2019s strategies for leveraging generative AI, managing hybrid cloud environments, and ensuring seamless IT operations.\n\nHe reveals how AI is transforming processes in finance, recruitment, and customer interaction while underlining how HPCL has been proactive in security, preventing vendor lock-in, and providing its employees with up-skilling to gain an upper edge in the digital race.\n\nHow is HPCL leveraging generative AI, and how do you address the associated security challenges?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat we\u2019ve done with Gen AI is that, at this point in time, we are using it more as models that are enterprise-based and on-prem. We use a couple of models like LLaMA and others to handle the generative part, like creating summaries or building intelligence from there. We\u2019ve been able to apply this across multiple use cases in various streams.\n\n\u2022 Finance: Generative AI is used to summarize audit reports, identify commonalities, and streamline processes, enabling auditors to detect recurring issues more efficiently.\n\n\u2022 Interactive Bots: Generative AI enhances chatbot capabilities, improving user interactions.\n\nAdvertisment\n\n\u2022 Recruitment: AI extracts data from scanned documents and forms, automating information entry and ensuring data consistency.\n\nSo far, using these on-prem solutions has worked well for us. Since we run everything within our environment, no data\u2014including metadata\u2014is pushed externally. However, we are grappling with challenges around certain LLMs that are cloud-based, such as Microsoft\u2019s CoPilot. While piloting these solutions, we\u2019ve noticed that metadata is sent out, even though the rest of the data remains internal. How safe this is remains an open question for us.\n\nHindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) has adopted a hybrid cloud model, using on-premises solutions for sensitive data and a public cloud for specialized APIs or functionalities.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhy did HPCL choose a hybrid cloud model, and how do you decide workloads for on-premise versus public cloud?\n\nThe decision to adopt a hybrid model is driven by cost considerations and specific functionality needs. With a Tier-4 green enterprise data centre, we prioritize using in-house resources but leverage the public cloud for specialized APIs or functionalities unavailable internally.\n\nThis setup allows us to use internal resources extensively, and we only look outside when necessary. Our solutions span across private, public, and hybrid cloud models, depending on the requirements.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhen deciding on these solutions, we consider two key factors:\n\n1. Cost: We prioritize more cost-effective solutions.\n\n2. Functionality: If a specific functionality, solution, or API is available on the cloud and is more effective, we adopt it.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWith a Tier-4 green enterprise data centre, we prioritize using in-house resources but leverage the public cloud for specialized APIs or functionalities unavailable internally.\n\nIn practice, workloads purely consumed and produced by the public are typically best suited for the public cloud. For workloads generated internally but accessed externally, we move them to the public cloud for better access. It ultimately depends on the type of solution required. However, for public-facing solutions, the public cloud is often the preferred choice.\n\nWhat challenges did you face while managing hybrid cloud environments?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhen data is moved to the public cloud, it\u2019s primarily used for access, so it\u2019s not a significant challenge. However, the real challenge arises in terms of response times between internal and external use. Public cloud responses are generally fast when accessed from the public side, but when coming from the enterprise side, they tend to be sluggish. There are noticeable variations in response times between these two environments.\n\nWorking with vendors also presents challenges. You\u2019ll always encounter issues with them, but the real limitation lies in the depth of the solutions they provide. Vendors often lack experts who fully understand the specific systems and environments you are using. As a result, it takes time for them to grasp your unique environment and needs.\n\nHow does HPCL address vendor lock-in and ensure cost efficiency in cloud solutions?\n\nVendor lock-in is an inevitable challenge for certain critical solutions like Microsoft Office and SAP. To mitigate this, we adopt a mixed technology stack, leveraging open-source products wherever feasible to reduce costs and maintain flexibility. This strategy minimizes dependencies while optimizing expenses.\n\nHow does HPCL ensure data security and compliance across its infrastructure?\n\nWe have implemented a Zero Trust Architecture to enhance data security across platforms. Additionally, our CISO team actively monitors compliance requirements, ensuring all systems adhere to stringent security protocols.\n\nHow do you improve the resilience and flexibility of HPCL\u2019s IT infrastructure?\n\nWe focus on redundant architecture to minimize downtime. Both of our data centres are configured in High Availability (HA) mode, ensuring uninterrupted service. In the event of one data centre being unavailable, the other takes over seamlessly.\n\nWhat advancements in hybrid cloud technology would most benefit HPCL?\n\nFor our enterprise, we\u2019ve observed that there aren\u2019t many solutions available right now that span seamlessly across to the cloud. Our data growth is relatively stable and linear, not exponential, making our data and compute requirements predictable. As such, we don\u2019t anticipate sudden spikes that would necessitate the use of the cloud.\n\nHowever, given the procurement cycle involved, we do need cloud resources available during periods when we\u2019re unable to deploy our own infrastructure. Currently, not all solutions offer this flexibility. Ideally, we would prefer a solution that allows our on-prem infrastructure to seamlessly extend to the cloud.\n\ninter\n\nHow does HPCL stay ahead of advancements in AI and emerging technologies?\n\nWe emphasize upskilling and collaboration. Our team participates in technical and strategic courses through partnerships with leading institutes like IIMs and IITs. Additionally, we adopt an \u201cearly adopter\u201d approach\u2014piloting emerging technologies, evaluating their feasibility, and swiftly discarding those that do not align with our goals.\n\nDo you have metrics to evaluate the success of new technology implementations?\n\nYes, we have established clear success criteria for technology adoption. Solutions go through a rigorous evaluation process, and only those that meet our benchmarks are deployed.\n\nThis structured approach ensures we derive maximum value from technology investments while staying agile in a rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nJayant Gupta\n\nExecutive Director of Information Systems, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited\n\naanchalg@cybermedia.co.in"

            "article_content": "This is the latest in my occasional series of conversations about Christianity, aimed at bridging America\u2019s God gulf. Here I speak with Elaine Pagels, a prominent professor of religion at Princeton University and an expert on the early church.\n\nNicholas Kristof: Merry Christmas! This is a time when Christianity celebrates \u201cMiracles and Wonder\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s the title of your fascinating forthcoming book. Your book raises questions about the virgin birth of Jesus, even pointing to ancient evidence that Jesus might have been fathered by a Roman soldier, possibly by rape. But before I ask you about that, I want to be respectful of readers who have a deep faith and may be upset by this line of inquiry. How do we follow the historical research without causing offense?\n\nElaine Pagels: I love these stories from the Gospels! The skies opened up when I heard them. They picture human lives drawn into divine mystery: \u201cGod in man made manifest,\u201d as one Christmas carol says. But at a certain point I had to ask: What do they mean? What really happened? They are not written simply as history; often they speak in metaphor. We can take them seriously without taking everything literally.\n\nKristof: So let\u2019s go back to the Nativity. Of the four Gospels, two describe the virgin birth of Jesus and two don\u2019t mention it. The Gospel of Mark has people of Galilee referring to Jesus as the son of Mary, when the norm was to describe somebody as the son of his father. So did the neighbors growing up with Jesus regard him as fatherless?\n\nPagels: We don\u2019t know. Mark is the earliest Gospel written; Matthew and Luke are basically just revising it. Mark has no suggestion of a virgin birth. Instead, he says that neighbors called Jesus \u201cson of Mary.\u201d In an intensely patriarchal society, this suggests that Jesus had no father that anyone knew about, even one deceased. Yet even without a partner, Mary has lots of children: In Mark, Jesus has four other brothers, and some sisters, with no recognized father and no genealogy.\n\nKristof: You note that Matthew and Luke both borrowed heavily from Mark\u2019s account but also seem embarrassed by elements of it, including the paternity question. Is your guess that they added the virgin birth to reduce that embarrassment?\n\nPagels: Yes, but this is not just my guess. When Matthew and Luke set out to revise Mark, each added an elaborate birth story \u2014 two stories that differ in almost every detail. Matthew adds a father named Joseph, who, seeing his fianc\u00e9e pregnant, and not with his child, decides to break the marriage contract. Luke, writing independently, pictures an angel astonishing a young virginal girl, announcing that \u201cthe Holy Spirit\u201d is about to make her pregnant.\n\nKristof: The most startling element of your book to me was that you cite evidence going back to the first and second centuries that some referred to Jesus as the son of a Roman soldier named Panthera. These accounts are mostly from early writers trying to disparage Jesus, it seems, so perhaps should be regarded skeptically. But you also write that Panthera appears to have been a real person. How should we think about this?\n\nPagels: Yes, these stories circulated after Jesus\u2019 death among members of the Jewish community who regarded him as a false messiah, saying that Jesus\u2019 father was a Roman soldier. I used to dismiss such stories as ancient slander. Yet while we do not know what happened, there are too many points of circumstantial evidence to simply ignore them. The name Panthera, sometimes spelled differently in ancient sources, may refer to a panther skin that certain soldiers wore. The discovery of the grave of a Roman soldier named Tiberius Panthera, member of a cohort of Syrian archers stationed in Palestine in the first century, might support those ancient rumors.\n\nKristof: You write that there were early accusations against Mary of promiscuity, connected to this allegation of an affair with Panthera. But you say that Roman soldiers brutally occupied Galilee in the period before Jesus was born, killing and raping with impunity. So, acknowledging that this is uncertainty stacked on uncertainty, if Panthera was involved, was it probably a case of rape?\n\nPagels: Jewish revolutionaries, fighting \u201cin the name of God and our common liberty\u201d to free their land from Roman domination, attacked a Roman fortress and killed many soldiers. The governor brought in Roman soldiers who crucified perhaps 2,000 Jews, then garrisoned thousands of soldiers less than 4 miles from Nazareth. The historian Josephus says that the soldiers stationed there ravaged the area, taking advantage of local people in every way they could. Josephus also notes that Galilean Jews were especially worried about their daughters\u2019 virginity. Noting such diverse evidence, I thought that these stories sounded plausible in a way I had never imagined.\n\nKristof: The virgin birth is just one miracle among many in the Gospels. Jesus walked on water. He raised people from the dead. He multiplied loaves and fishes. He\u2019s resurrected and ascends to heaven. So how should those of us in the 21st century see miracles?\n\nPagels: Calling something a miracle is a way of interpreting an event. A friend of mine was hit by a car and thrown about 20 feet, and was unharmed. She told me that this was a miracle. Someone else might have said, \u201cI was lucky.\u201d Calling it a miracle interprets an event that others might see differently. This often happens with remissions of illness: Some people see many miracles, and some never see any.\n\nKristof: I disagree with most evangelicals and conservative Catholics on political questions. But I also find that my fellow liberals are often deeply unfair to conservative Christians. Some of the most heroic aid work around the world is done by Christian organizations like World Vision, Catholic Relief Services and International Justice Mission. Shouldn\u2019t those of us in the liberal world be celebrating this kind of faith-based aid instead of belittling it?\n\nPagels: Absolutely. I just came from Tennessee, where I was visiting an Episcopal Church program dealing with incarcerated people. There I spoke to a group of men on death row who are taking a course of study, reading and discussing the Bible, and it was quite extraordinary.\n\nKristof: You have a foot in each of two worlds, faith and academia, that often seem like rival sides of the God gulf. Can we find paths of mutual respect to bridge that chasm?\n\nPagels: The Gospels most often speak in the language of stories and poetry. Intellectualizing these traditions \u2014 or turning them into dogma \u2014 doesn\u2019t make them spiritually deep. What we call Christianity is not a single thing. Instead, it consists of a 2,000-year-old collection of stories, prayers, liturgies, music, miracles \u2014 sources drawn from traditions as different as Eastern Orthodoxy is from Pentecostalism or Christian Science. No one can swallow the entire tradition: It\u2019s undigestible! Instead, anyone who identifies as Christian chooses certain elements of it.\n\nA professor friend said to me: \u201cI\u2019m an atheist. How can you believe all that stuff?\u201d First of all, as I see it, \u201cbelieving all that stuff\u201d is not the point. The Christian message, as I experienced it, was transformational. It encouraged me to treat other people well and opened up a world of imagination and wonder.\n\nKristof: Your own faith journey seems to bridge the chasm. You were raised in a household hostile to faith, then became an evangelical, then had a crisis when a friend died and you were told he wouldn\u2019t go to heaven because he was Jewish.\n\nPagels: When some Christians said to me that non-Christians are going to hell, I left their church. That made no sense to me. What about Jesus\u2019 message of God\u2019s love? At that point I left Christianity behind. For some people, there\u2019s no middle ground. You\u2019re either in or out \u2014 that\u2019s how it\u2019s often practiced. So for years I was out, although I knew that something powerful was there. But after years of being out, I kept wondering, what made that encounter with Christianity so powerful?\n\nSo I had to go back, asking questions. How were these stories written? How do they affect us so powerfully? They speak to a deep human longing for a sense of transcendence and spiritual experience. For we can respond to the same story in more than one way. As a historian, I question the literal truth of the virgin birth story. But I still love the midnight service on Christmas Eve, where the story is gloriously told and sung as miracle. As poet Seamus Heaney writes, \u201cBelieve that a further shore / is reachable from here. / Believe in miracles.\u201d\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "It is widely known among scientists that light sometimes appears to exit a material before it has even entered. This odd \u201cnegative time\u201d phenomenon was long seen as an illusion caused by the way waves become distorted by matter.\n\nOver time, many considered it a harmless quirk of physics, dismissed without much further investigation. Now, fresh experiments suggest that this behavior might carry deeper implications related to \u201cnegative time.\u201d\n\nResearchers recently posted findings on the preprint server arXiv, drawing global interest and some reservations about what it all means.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d is no longer theoretical\n\nAephraim Steinberg, a University of Toronto professor in experimental quantum physics, has seen how people can misunderstand discussions about negative time.\n\n\u201cThis is tough stuff, even for us to talk about with other physicists. We get misunderstood all the time,\u201d he said. His team contends that negative time is not just theoretical but may exist in a measurable way.\n\nThey remain cautious in describing their experiments, emphasizing that the results reflect a subtle effect in quantum mechanics.\n\n\u201cThat time turned out to be negative,\u201d Steinberg explained. Their data points to strange interactions between light and matter that defy everyday assumptions.\n\nQuantum quirks\n\nTheir basement lab brims with mirrors, wires, and delicate lasers that track how photons interact with atoms.\n\nThe atoms sometimes absorb photons and later emit them, leaving the atoms in an excited state for a short period. Measuring this period was tricky, and to many, it sounded like it might flirt with impossibilities.\n\nSteinberg and graduate student Daniela Angulo focused on the short time atoms remain excited. By collecting data on how atoms emit absorbed light, they uncovered intervals that appeared less than zero.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to say anything traveled backward in time,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s a misinterpretation.\u201d\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d doesn\u2019t violate reality\n\nInvestigations into quantum phenomena often spark worry about collisions with Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity.\n\nYet nothing in these experiments hints that any object can outrun light. Photons here do not convey information faster than physical laws permit, so there is no conflict with long-accepted principles.\n\nSome have questioned whether labeling this interval as negative time might invite confusion.\n\nThe team is aware that such language can sound surreal, but they believe it captures the unusual nature of quantum measurements that drift from usual expectations.\n\nPhotons and probabilities\n\nPhotons have a split personality, sometimes acting like particles and other times behaving like waves.\n\nThey follow probability rules that let them appear in multiple states at once, prompting a range of possible outcomes. This fuzziness underpins the notion that events do not always fit into a neat timeline.\n\nIn standard settings, photons pass through materials in ways consistent with well-established physics.\n\nBut in the group\u2019s experiments, certain measurements produce results that slip into territory most would never predict.\n\nThese findings spark curiosity about how quantum mechanics can present effects that appear at odds with common sense.\n\nReactions and skepticism\n\nThe concept has captured the attention of many, including German theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, who remains unimpressed.\n\n\u201cThe negative time in this experiment has nothing to do with the passage of time \u2014 it\u2019s just a way to describe how photons travel through a medium and how their phases shift,\u201d she said in a YouTube video with more than 250,000 views.\n\nSome observers suspect the term negative time is too dramatic and misrepresents the study\u2019s scope. Others argue that a fresh approach could encourage deeper conversations about how quantum processes unfold.\n\nThe researchers maintain they are not rewriting the rules of physics but aiming to highlight the weirdness at play in fundamental experiments.\n\nNext steps for \u201cnegative time\u201d studies\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made our choice about what we think is a fruitful way to describe the results,\u201d Steinberg said, adding that while practical applications remain elusive, the findings open new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena.\n\nHe acknowledged that many remain skeptical, but he insists the numbers speak for themselves. No serious criticism has challenged their raw data.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t currently have a path from what we\u2019ve been looking at toward applications,\u201d Steinberg admitted. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep thinking about it, but I don\u2019t want to get people\u2019s hopes up.\u201d\n\nWhether the idea of negative time transforms into something with everyday uses remains to be seen, yet the curiosity it sparks is hard to ignore.\n\nWhat does all of this mean?\n\nTo sum it all up, quantum physics has always pushed boundaries, forcing researchers to adjust old assumptions.\n\nThese experiments from the University of Toronto team serve as another reminder that the world behaves in ways that do not always match common intuition. Still, they stress that no claims of time travel are on the table.\n\nBy presenting evidence that something can measure out to less than zero time, these researchers have challenged expectations about how light interacts with matter.\n\nFor now, the puzzle remains a subject of debate. Unraveling the enigma might take further studies, but many agree that investigating such bizarre possibilities is part of the ongoing effort to understand quantum reality.\n\nThe results highlight how experiments can produce outcomes that differ from conventional thinking. Negative intervals in absorption times remain an intriguing piece of a much broader puzzle.\n\nScientists continue to refine experiments and weigh alternative explanations. Despite lingering questions, the project stands as a reminder that quantum behavior can seem downright strange, to put it mildly.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal arXiv.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Prologue\n\nQuite by accident, a neighbor said to me that the New York Times had a lengthy opinion piece in support of animal farms, which represent the worst form of modern agriculture. I checked it out and the neighbor was right. The New York Times had more than one opinion piece parroting the anxieties of agricultural scientists and advertisements and misleading rhetoric of agribusiness. The editor of the effort, Eliza Barclay, is confident that the future of our food may rest \u201cin vast, sustainably managed factory farms [relying on] water\u2026 pumped across the country, from the Great Lakes to California.\u201d\n\nDante\u2019s inferno\n\nThis science fiction fantasy shocked me. I have been reading the New York Times, on and off, for many years. Its reporters write well and, in some instances, cover controversial and conventional politics and international affairs, though in the case of the wars in Ukraine and Israel, the Times follows strictly the script of the State Department.\n\nBut reading eloquent articles in support of the so-called \u201cgreen revolution,\u201d pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, giant automated harvester machines and \u201ctaking care\u201d of millions of cattle in order to add some more pounds of meat on their bodies on the eve of their slaughter, was too much. David Wallace-Wells, one of the opinion writers for the New York Times, started the discussion with an extensive article exploring the vulnerabilities of agriculture at a time climate chaos is changing everything, including conventional farming. He says that the alternative farming ways like no-till (climate-friendly regenerative practices) is losing its appeal. And vegetarianism is apparently a fad among the rich, while meat-eating has been expanding in a dramatic and unconscionable rate in both America and Europe.\n\nCertainly, these are troubling trends as meat eating is responsible for the largest amounts of greenhouse gases coming out of agriculture. About half of the land on the planet is for growing food. And three-quarters of that land produces feed for livestock.\n\nSome of the concerns raised by Wallace-Wells are legitimate, though he repeated agribusiness myths like that of the miraculous impact of the green revolution in Asia. In posing the problems of a farming \u201csystem\u201d embraced by climate chaos and abuse / overuse of drinking water worldwide, he said nothing of what could reduce the looming dangers of fossil-fuel agriculture caught in the tectonic plates of billionaire control and addiction to hazardous pesticides and gigantic machines. Meat eating must be dramatically reduced as much as population must decline \u2014 dramatically. No woman should have more than one child.\n\nWorld leaders and scientists must finally become adults in the room. Stop wars. They are climate fuses. Phaseout at lease 50 percent of fossil fuels by 2030. Split large estates to small organic farms, which use neither pesticides, nor synthetic or sludge fertilizers, radiation, and genetic engineering. Join ancient knowledge of growing food with the latest insights from the science of agroecology. We cannot keep saying we must double food production because we expect an additional billion or two of humans \u2013 by 2050.\n\nThe dismal picture Wallace-Wells painted becomes the background for the ideas and arguments in support of a thoroughly discredited, corrupt and violent slaughterhouse / animal farm for the climate-ridden agriculture of skyscrapers of the future. Expanding animal farms horizontally or vertically is wrong and immoral. These animal factories separate farmers and non-farmers from nature. They justify the manipulation and the dumping of the sacred Earth and her sacred animals in their shredding machine. It\u2019s as if we cannot learn from our past errors. We keep disregarding millennial agrarian traditions and civilizations, much less science, ecology and a livable future. Xenophon, student of Socrates and general and historian, mirrored Homer in arguing that small-scale farming made the Greeks food secure and champions of freedom, democracy, science, craftsmanship, piety for the gods, and civilization.\n\nWhich is better, the small or the large farm?\n\nWe cannot ignore Xenophon. Small farms are civilization. Vast factory farms are alien to civilization. They are large factories of disease, mechanized inhumanity and gargantuan violence. Vast industrial farms do not produce more food per acre than tiny family farms. They give birth instead to local and global hunger.\n\nMiguel Altieri, Professor Emeritus of agroecology at the University of California, Berkeley, is very concerned about the dominance of industrial agriculture. \u201cThis crisis,\u201d he says, \u201cthreatens the livelihoods of over a billion hungry people, [it] is the direct result of the dominating industrial farming model, which is dangerously dependent on fossil fuels and has also become the largest source of human impact on the biosphere. Ninety-one per cent of the 1.5 billion hectares of cropland are under annual crops worldwide, mostly monocultures of wheat, rice, maize, cotton, and soybeans highly dependent on inputs of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and huge amounts of irrigation water, and which increasingly advance at the expense of forests and other natural vegetation. In this [twenty-first] century, one of the main ecological dilemmas arising from the environmental homogenization of agricultural systems is an increased vulnerability of crops to climate change. Subsidized grain monocultures convey temporary economic advantages to a few large-scale farmers, but in the long term they do not represent an ecological optimum. Rather, the drastic narrowing of cultivated plant diversity has put the world\u2019s food production in greater peril. The social and environmental impacts of local crop shortfalls resulting from such uniformity can be considerable in an era of climatic extremes as crop losses often mean ongoing ecological degradation, poverty, hunger and even famine.\u201d\n\nAltieri also argues that small family farms are more productive than large industrial farms. \u201cIn overall output, the diversified [small] farm,\u201d he says, \u201cproduces much more food, even if measured in dollars. In the USA data shows that the smallest 2-hectare farms produced $15,104 per hectare and netted about $2,902 per acre. The largest farms, averaging 15,581 hectares, yielded $249 per hectare and netted about $52 per hectare. Not only do small-medium-sized farms exhibit higher yields than conventional farmers but do so with much lower negative impact on the environment. Small farms are \u2018multi-functional\u2019\u2013 more productive, more efficient, and contribute more to economic development than do large farms. Communities surrounded by populous small farms have healthier economies than do communities surrounded by depopulated large, mechanized farms. One recent study on the impact of small farms on local economies found that small producers create 10% more permanent jobs, a 20% larger increase in retail sales, and a 37% larger increase in local per capita income. Small farmers also take better care of natural resources, including reducing soil erosion and conserving biodiversity.\u201d\n\nIn addition, small organic family farms cool the climate. They have been sequestering greenhouse gases into the soil.\n\nI have also documented these advantages of small farms in my works. I learned from my long experience at the US Environmental Protection Agency. Small is beautiful. Small farms in a village or near towns grow wholesome food, which becomes human and environmental health, supporting honeybees and biodiversity, wildlife, democracy and a cooler planet.\n\nIn contrast, large farms, and especially vast animal factories, produce unhealthy food contaminated for the most part by neurotoxic and carcinogenic pesticides and antibiotics. The medical and ecological costs of this food are high, harming both humans and nature. Chemicals and machines threaten the integrity of the natural world and the philosophical and political health of democratic societies. What is a growing boy and girl supposed to think of themselves and their parents seeing the elders building the infrastructure of factory death, which includes billions of animals and the periodic spread of deadly pandemics?\n\nWeaponized farming\n\nSo, the New York Times has weaponized agriculture for probably similar reasons it favors America\u2019s funding of the horrendous war in Ukraine and Israel\u2019s wars against Palestine-Lebanon-Syria. Israel is having America fight its wars \u2014 in order to fulfill a fictional delusion, recreating Israel on the basis of the sayings of a seventh century BCE Biblical author. Yet astonishingly, this doesn\u2019t bother the Times or the Biden administration.\n\nThe planetary emperor\n\nJeffrey Sachs of Columbia University explains America\u2019s obsession with war like a symptom of megalomania and delusion of global hegemony. He is right. I have reached a similar conclusion. Greek history is very instructive about things political and philosophical. What the Athenian rural oligarchs did in the sixth century BCE \u2013 selling into slavery Athenian peasants who could not repay their debt, still speaks to us. But, fortunately, the rest of the Athenian powerful invited Solon to solve the crisis. Solon was a former ruler and a patriot. He knew the billionaires of his age. He made slavery illegal and set the foundations of democracy. But in addition to the insights that inspire me from Greek history, I have been observing America for several decades. Regrettably, America follows closely the career of imperial Rome and England, especially in agriculture. Four of my books document the rise of the large farms and their ecological and political deleterious effects in America and the world.\n\nSachs has spent his life watching carefully US finance policy makers and especially the dramatic domestic and global impact of the Military-Industrial Complex, the trillions of dollars the US has been spending for having or thinking and willing to believe in a total strategic dominance over the planet by encircling the Earth with more than 750 military bases. However, the costs of this imaginary planetary control are very high. The US government and the billionaires behind the throne and the \u201clawmakers\u201d in Washington, DC, have done very little to stop, much less correct, the degradation of the country\u2019s infrastructure. I rode a bullet train, not in America, but in China. There are no protections for those who avoid driving a car. I ride my bike and twice cars almost killed me. American oligarchs have also failed miserably to stop and reverse the growing inequality between the few and the many. Senator Bernie Sanders speaks of the billionaire class. Sachs said that 10 Americans have over a trillion dollars.\n\nIt\u2019s this reality, hubris of global hegemony and its unfathomable costs, that threaten America. The construction of a sandcastle of planetary control as well as the real control and management of the US economy by a handful of billionaires explains the tilt of the New York Times in embracing vast animal farms as the new mode of agriculture. Mega factory farms, however, have never strived to feed the world. The \u201cgreen revolution\u201d was no more than a campaign to grab land from small farmers and sell pesticides and fertilizers and agricultural machines. It did not feed people who did not have the money to buy food. In fact, the number of hungry people is increasing in the world. In 2023, about 757 million people were hungry.\n\nThe billionaire owners of large factory farms, exactly like the dark age feudal landlords of England and France, use slaughterhouses to control the food people eat. They also buy most of the best land. They hide these political goals. And media and newspapers like the New York Times help them cover up those secrets.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.
