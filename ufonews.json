Strange\u2026 pic.twitter.com/TvR0yyti1n \u2014 Dilojan (@umadilojan) November 29, 2024\n\nOther users described what they said was an \u201corb\u201d, a \u201cmetallic sphere\u201d, or questioned if it was a drone.\n\nA British \u201cufologist\u201d, Mark Christopher Lee, spoke to outlets such as the Daily Express, asserting that the mysterious orb drew parallels to other incidents such as when the Australian government apparently captured an alien sphere in 1957.\n\nHowever, Manchester Airport has spoken out about the UFO theories and debunked the claims.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe airport told The Independent that they believed the images to be fake, and even though the object could be a balloon or something similar, they saw nothing that proved the images were genuine unaltered footage.\n\nA spokesperson further added to the Express: \u201cWe have systems that pick up anything that could be a threat to aviation.\n\n\u201cAnything that gives off a signal we would know about.\u201d\n\nHe added that if there was anything on the airfield at the airport, as is depicted in the imagery, it would be treated as a major incident, and no such disruption event has occurred.\n\nThe Manchester Airport theories come weeks after the Pentagon released a report revealing hundreds of incidents they have encountered with unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena \u2013 however, there are no indications suggesting any extraterrestrial origin.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s review covered 757 cases from around the world reported to US authorities between 1 May 2023 to 1 June 2024.\n\nThey found explanations for nearly 300 incidents, including unknown objects revealing to be balloons, birds, aircraft, drones or satellites.\n\nThe report also said that Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite system has become an increasingly common source of people mistaking the chains of satellites for UFOs.\n\nHowever, there are hundreds of other cases which remain unexplained, though the report stressed that is often because there isn\u2019t enough information available to draw firm conclusions.\n\nFor more travel news and advice, listen to Simon Calder\u2019s podcast"

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nConnecticut police officer Robert Klein, a 25-year law enforcement veteran, says he had a UFO encounter that was like something straight out of a movie. He told his wild story to Ashleigh Banfield on her show last week.\n\nKlein explained to Banfield that in April 2022 an intense, glowing light filled his police car, changed colors, and flew through the air at speeds that defied the laws of physics as we know them. He says he got a good look at the UFO, and it was a \u201cperfect sphere\u201d about the size of a Mini Cooper as it hovered just 30 feet from his vehicle.\n\nThe UFO encounter occurred on a dark stretch of road near a local reservoir in Fairfield County, Connecticut about 40 minutes into his shift.\n\nKlein claims the UFO had a \u201cplasma-like\u201d look to it and its color changed between red, green, white, and orange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen my fair share of drones and meteors,\u201d Klein told Banfield. \u201cThis was something I\u2019ve never come across before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a really strong light. It lit up the entire cab of my cruiser to the point where I was having a hard time driving because I really couldn\u2019t see,\u201d Klein continued. \u201cI was blinded by it.\n\n\u201cSo I immediately put [his car] into park, rolled down the window and blocked the light with my hand because it was very intense to see where it was coming from and what exactly it was. At that point the lights started to move along the left side of the cruiser. So it stopped right in front, off to the left. As I looked up, that\u2019s when I saw this object.\u201d\n\nHe says the UFO emitted \u201ca low hum, which was very distinct.\u201d When he trained his car\u2019s spotlight on the UFO it made an \u201cinstantaneous\u201d movement and flew across the water at an extremely high rate of speed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I sort of snapped out of it and took out my camera and started recording and taking pictures,\u201d Klein explained. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see it go from A to B, that\u2019s how fast it moved.\u201d\n\nRoss Coulthart, an Australian investigative journalist and author who believes governments are covering up their knowledge of UFOs, was later asked to address Officer Klein\u2019s claims on another show which aired on NewsNation.\n\n\u201cIn this case we have a very senior police officer, a man of high credit who\u2019s worked for his community for 25 years,\u201d Coulthart very validly pointed out. \u201cWhy would he expose himself to public vilification and ridicule, or at least the risk thereof, by speaking about UFOs?\u201d"

            "article_content": "A lot of AI tools promise something like magic. Just write down all the stuff you need to do, or better yet, just let the tool record every second of your life, and presto manifesto, it\u2019ll do\u2026 something. Buy plane tickets, maybe, or magically reorder your calendar to maximize your flow state. The idea is huge and enticing, that you could just live your life and your AI assistant will make everything happen on your behalf. But hardly any of it works.\n\nThe developers of the app Twos are taking a much more cautious and, as a result, much more actually useful approach. Twos is an app for taking notes, managing to-dos, and generally making lists of any and every kind \u2014 Parker Klein, the app\u2019s creator, just calls it \u201ca place to write things down.\u201d Klein has been working on the app for nearly a decade, first as a tool just for himself and most recently as a true startup. I\u2019ve been using Twos off and on for a couple of years, and there\u2019s a lot to like about the app.\n\nThe Twos AI approach, which Klein and cofounder Joe Steilberg call \u201csmart suggestions,\u201d is to use AI to help you simply take the first step in getting something done. If you write down the name of a movie, Twos might offer you a link to a JustWatch search or the IMDb page for that movie. If you write a person\u2019s name and phone number, it can add them to your contacts with one tap. If you\u2019re making a grocery list, it\u2019ll send you to Amazon or Walmart or Instacart to buy it.\n\nThe logic behind all these suggestions is really simple: Twos looks for certain words and phrases to determine what you\u2019re trying to do and which integration makes the most sense. (You can pick and choose, too \u2014 I never use Uber Eats, for instance, so I turned that off entirely.) All the smart suggestions really do is take the first step. They\u2019re definitely not perfect \u2014 when I type \u201cbake blueberry muffins,\u201d it offers me an Allrecipes link, which is helpful and relevant, and a Google Maps search for \u201cblueberry muffins around me,\u201d which is not. But even in the feature\u2019s early days, I\u2019ve found it way more useful than almost every other, vastly more ambitious productivity tool.\n\nLike any to-do list app worth its valuation, Twos now has an AI chatbot. Image: Twos\n\nTwos also has a built-in chatbot, which you can use to ask questions about your notes. If you use your note-taking app like a journal, this can be really cool \u2014 \u201cwhat was the name of that Thai food place we went to a few weeks ago?\u201d is a surprisingly common question in my life. Lots of apps have something like this, and they all suffer from the same problem: if you don\u2019t put everything in the app, the search isn\u2019t that useful. But whether it\u2019s Notion or Dropbox or Twos, the AI integrations reward the heaviest users.\n\nAI turns Twos into not just my to-do list but the jumping-off point for all my tasks. Since the app works across platforms \u2014 it\u2019s fundamentally a web app, but there are versions for Android and iOS, Windows and Mac, and more \u2014 it\u2019s easy to just dump information into. Then, when it\u2019s time to leave for the restaurant I wrote down and promptly forgot the name of, I open Twos, tap the sparkles that appear next to any item with a smart suggestion, and it opens Google Maps and directs me there. You can store and organize things inside of Twos, but I find myself using it transiently, just for the small things in day-to-day life. I need to make bread: click the sparkles, bread recipes appear. Remember to buy those Sesame Street bath toys for the kid: click the sparkles, Amazon search done. Ollie\u2019s birthday is December 7th: click the sparkles, in my contacts.\n\nFor now, the Twos smart suggestions are only available in beta testing, and there\u2019s a waitlist for new users. (Though Klein did tell me that if you sign up and use the code \u201cVerge,\u201d you\u2019ll be able to skip the line.) Klein and Steilberg are working on more integrations and more ways to do even more with just a few words of your writing. They\u2019re obviously enticed by how far this might go. Why not automatically buy the toys or start the grocery delivery and take a cut for themselves? It\u2019s an age-old idea, that one. Any.do tried it years ago; there was even a frenzy of apps like Magic that would do it all via text message. Even the Alexa business model used to depend on you being willing to just shout \u201cbuy toilet paper\u201d at your speaker and trust it to do the rest.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with the idea: it doesn\u2019t work. There are too many logistical questions, too many ways to screw it up, and too many consequences for getting it wrong that it\u2019s not going to work anytime soon. If ever."

            "article_content": "Have you ever wondered when you\u2019ll die? Well, a new app called Death Clock aims to help you answer that question. The app uses trained death prediction AI, which looks at various answers provided by the app\u2019s users. The AI then predicts when you\u2019ll die, as well as offers some additional ways to improve your health and live longer.\n\nConsidering how important the quest to slow human aging has become for many scientists, the actual want for an app like this is pretty high. Additionally, the information could help elderly people who are worried about outliving their money, the folks behind it told Bloomberg. Being able to more accurately determine when they might reach the end of the road is important.\n\nThe big thing with this new death prediction AI is that the app it powers is supposedly a \u201cpretty significant\u201d improvement on the current standard life tables that we utilize to determine mortality estimates.\n\nThe app\u2019s questionnaire asks many questions about the user, including things like age, gender, family history, mental health, and even information about chronic conditions. The studies it was trained on also included more than 50 million participants, so it should have a nice baseline to build off of.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nHowever, the real meat of the app is locked behind a $40 subscription fee\u2014which could be a turnoff for many, especially as this is where it hides the various suggestions for improving your habits. Subscribing will also show you a clock that counts down to your estimated death, in case you want to let the death prediction AI make things even more morbid than they already might be.\n\nWhether or not this kind of app is for you is up to you to decide. While I can definitely see the appeal of knowing how your health conditions and all might affect your mortality, I\u2019m also of the mind that I\u2019d rather not have a clock counting down to the day I\u2019m going to die\u2014even if it is just a rough estimate. That\u2019s a bit too morbid for me to think about consistently. But, if you do want to know when you\u2019re going to die, Death Clock can tell you."

Talking to Dermot O'Leary on his Audible podcast, he said: 'I wish it was a little bit more interesting.\n\n'A lot of the time it feels like they don't take risks any more, which they used to.\n\nIn July, it was reported that Jonathan could be set for a BBC comeback as he is reportedly in talks for to take part in the celebrity spin-off of The Traitors\n\nAn insider said: 'Jonathan is the ideal target for producers because he's a high-profile celebrity who doesn't regularly appear on the reality TV circuit'\n\nJonathan previously claimed the BBC has become more risk-averse and dull in the wake of his Sachsgate scandal on Radio 2. Pictured are Brand and Ross singing an apology for Sachsgate\n\n'Obviously I'm part of the reason they don't do that any more because of the huge cock-up of me and Russell on his show.\n\n'It's one of the reasons they allowed themselves to be beaten back into a position of, 'Oh, don't take risks, don't take chances.\n\n'To an extent I sympathise with that, but at the same time that's why I don't listen to a lot.'\n\nDespite the public outcry over what became known as Sachsgate \u2013 which was even discussed in Parliament \u2013 Ross did not consider walking away from the broadcaster, claiming the issue had been 'blown out of all proportion'.\n\nRecalling the incident, Jonathan added: 'I didn't want the people who were going for me and going for Russell to win. That would have been their victory.\n\n'I didn't want to throw anyone under the bus, but after the recording I actually said, 'You know you can't put that out unless we have his [Sachs's] permission? You've got to make sure\u2026' That's why the BBC couldn't fire me.'\n\nSachs, who died in 2016 aged 86, said that the pair's 'lewd banter was deeply hurtful'."

In a brand-new teaser--that looks like an homage to the first GTA 6 trailer--the company showed off some of the gameplay for Ananta, where players will patrol the streets of Nova City as an agent of the Anti-Chaos Directorate.\n\nSimilar to other gacha games like Zenless Zone Zero, Ananta has an anime-inspired design, and Naked Science says that players will get to explore an \"open-world urban RPG\" where they take on the forces of Chaos.\n\n\"Nova City has plunged into Chaos, from spooky paranormal phenomena to toilets racing through traffic in the streets, the game promises to offer a unique blend of humor, adventure, and mystery,\" the official description for Ananta reads.\n\nAs seen in the trailer above, it looks like there'll be some bizarre enemies to face off against, like sentient toilet armies, cars armed with chainsaw arms, and other forms of weirdness plaguing Nova City. You'll be able to get around the metropolis in a variety of vehicles, and judging by the trailer, it looks like the characters can also swing into action or sneak around enemies in a manner that looks heavily inspired by Insomniac's recent Spider-Man games.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, Naked Science added that you can use your surroundings to defeat enemies, and between patrols, you'll also be able to take a break with various activities ranging from pub crawls to pumping some iron in a local gym. Ananta is in development for PC, PS5, and iOS, but it doesn't have a release date yet."

            "article_content": "An effective alternative to troublesome script-based solutions\n\nTORONTO, Dec. 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- As the March 31, 2025 deadline for PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) v4.0 compliance approaches, businesses face heightened pressure to meet new standards, particularly those related to the management and monitoring of third-party scripts on payment pages (requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1). While these standards are crucial for securing consumer payment data, many businesses find that traditional, script-based solutions don't address the growing threat of cyberattacks and payment page tampering. Available today, DataStealth offers a superior, no-code, fully managed solution that helps businesses achieve compliance within a few weeks.\n\nRequirement 6.4.3 mandates that any business that transacts online maintains an inventory of scripts on payment pages, ensuring that these scripts are not tampered with, and preventing unauthorized scripts from executing in the consumer's browser. Requirement 11.6.1 mandates real-time detection of any unauthorized changes to payment page scripts or HTTP headers. Both requirements demand constant monitoring and proactive strategies to ensure the integrity of payment systems. The complexity and resource-intensive nature of these tasks are leading many businesses to struggle with compliance, increasing the risk of fines, payment processing suspensions, and security breaches.\n\n\"As the deadline approaches, relying on reactive solutions is no longer an option. If you look under the hood of how traditional script-based methods work, you'll find unavoidable weaknesses and high maintenance efforts which leave critical payment data vulnerable. Our no-code solution requires a simple one-time DNS change to deploy, offering true real-time security, preventing malicious content from executing, and protecting every single payment transaction,\" said Ed Leavens, CEO and Co-Founder of DataStealth.\n\nBrowser-based, script-driven solutions have significant drawbacks because they do not support 100% of browsers and servers, and rely on scripts running in a specific order, making them vulnerable to missed detections or delayed threat defences. Additionally, they fail to detect complex or dynamic script tampering and may malfunction across different browsers, creating security gaps. Scripts can also be blocked or disabled, rendering the solution ineffective. Lastly, many of these solutions only alert administrators to tampering rather than blocking unauthorized content, which puts compliance at risk.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "(Reuters) - AI search startup Perplexity said on Thursday it was adding more than a dozen new media partners, including the Los Angeles Times and The Independent, to its program where it shares a portion of ad revenue with the publishers.\n\nIn its first set of partners from regions including Japan, Spain and Latin America, Perplexity said companies such as Prisa Media and Newspicks will now be part of the publishers' program, joining existing partners like TIME, Der Spiegel and Fortune.\n\n\"With these new partners ... (Perplexity can) provide insights that resonate with users from different backgrounds and geographies. Their participation ensures that our responses to user queries remain comprehensive (and) nuanced,\" Perplexity said in a statement.\n\nThe firm, backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and leading AI chipmaker Nvidia, launched the program in July, which involves sharing ad revenue from interactions when a publisher's content is referenced.\n\nThe program also gives publishers access to Perplexity's Application Programming Interface, or API, which allows software programs to interact with each other, and also provides data analytics to track trends and content performance.\n\nThe move comes at a time when Perplexity is in a legal tussle with News Corp-owned publishers, with Dow Jones and New York Post suing the company in October, claiming it engages in a \"massive amount of illegal copying\" of their copyrighted work.\n\nNew York Times has also sent Perplexity a \"cease and desist\" notice, demanding it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes.\n\nPerplexity, one of the firms attempting to disrupt the search engine market dominated by Alphabet's Google, has started testing advertising on its AI-powered search platform.\n\n(Reporting by Priyanka.G and Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Vijay Kishore)"
