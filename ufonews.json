            "article_content": "UFO 50 is one of the most impressive and audacious video game releases in recent memory, precisely because of what it doesn't do. There are no hyperrealistic graphics or massive open worlds. Instead, UFO 50 is a collection of 50 games that pay homage to classic titles from the 1980s. Think of it as the Well-Tempered Clavier of 8-bit gaming.\n\nThe backstory of UFO 50 is that the games are the catalog of a fictional game company from the '80s. There are platformers, shoot-'em-ups, side-scrolling beat-'em-ups, RPGs, puzzle games, turn-based strategies, a point-and-click horror adventure, Metroidvanias, dungeon crawlers, and more. The collection recreates not just the pixel graphics and chunky synth soundtracks\u2014which are delightful\u2014but the experience of dusting off a trove of video game cartridges and exploring them at your leisure.\n\nLike their inspirations, these games don't hold your hand. There are no tutorials, and part of the fun is going into a game blind and figuring out its internal logic. For those who grew up in the 1980s and '90s, it's all a heady dose of nostalgia, but these aren't merely reskinned copies of old titles or minigames. A group of independent developers spent eight years crafting them, and each one is a complete game with an original idea or twist.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shock of UFO 50 is how consistently good all the titles are. The simple controls, tight design, and challenging-but-rewarding gameplay reminds players why video games are fun in the first place. If you've ever had trouble putting down a controller because \"just one more try,\" you will become obsessed with at least one\u2014more likely several\u2014of UFO 50's offerings.\n\nThe post Review: UFO 50 Pays Homage to '80s Video Games appeared first on Reason.com."

            "article_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nCharacter.ai is a popular app for chatting with bots. Its millions of chatbots, most created by users, all play different roles. Some are broad: general-purpose assistants, tutors, or therapists; others are based, unofficially, on public figures and celebrities. Many are hyperspecific fictional characters pretty clearly created by teenagers. Its currently \u201cfeatured\u201d chatbots include a motivational bot named \u201cSergeant Whitaker,\u201d a \u201ctrue alpha\u201d called \u201cGiga Brad,\u201d the viral pygmy hippopotamus Moo Deng, and Socrates; among my \u201crecommended\u201d bots are a psychopathic \u201cBillionaire CEO,\u201d \u201cOBSESSED Tutor,\u201d a lesbian bodyguard, \u201cSchool Bully,\u201d and \u201cLab experiment,\u201d which allows the user to assume the role of a mysterious creature discovered by and interacting with a team of scientists.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange and fascinating product. While chatbots like ChatGPT or Anthropic\u2019s Claude mostly perform for users as a single broad, helpful, and intentionally anodyne character of a flexible omni-assistant, Character.ai emphasizes how similar models can be used to synthesize countless other sorts of performances that are contained, to some degree, in the training data.\n\nIt\u2019s also one of the most popular generative-AI apps on the market with more than 20 million active users, who skew young and female. Some spend enormous amounts of time chatting with their personae. They develop deep attachments to Character.ai chatbots and protest loudly when they learn that the company\u2019s models or policies are changing. They ask characters to give advice or resolve problems. They hash out deeply personal stuff. On Reddit and elsewhere, users describe how Character.ai makes them feel less lonely, a use for the app that its founders have promoted. Others talk about their sometimes explicit relationships with Character.ai bots, which deepen over months. And some say they have gradually lost their grip on what exactly they\u2019re doing and with what, exactly, they\u2019re doing it.\n\nIn a recent pair of lawsuits, parents claim worse. One, filed by the mother of a 14-year-old who committed suicide, describes how her son became withdrawn after developing a relationship with a chatbot on the \u201cdangerous and untested\u201d app and suggests it encouraged his decision. Another claims that Character.ai helped drive a 17-year-old to self-harm, encouraged him to disconnect from his family and community, and seemed to imply that he should consider killing his parents in response to limitations on screen time:\n\nPhoto: United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas v. Character Technologies Inc.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to put yourself in the parents\u2019 shoes here \u2014 imagine finding these messages on your kid\u2019s phone! If they\u2019d come from a person, you might hold that person responsible for what happened to your kid. That they came from an app is distressing in a similar but different way. You\u2019d wonder, reasonably, Why the fuck does this exist?\n\nThe basic defense available to Character.ai here is that its chats are labeled as fiction (though more comprehensively now than they were before the app attracted negative attention) and that users should, and generally do, understand that they\u2019re interacting with software. In the Character.ai community on Reddit, users made harsher versions of this and related arguments:\n\nThe parents are losing this lawsuit there\u2019s no way they\u2019re gonna win there\u2019s obviously a hella ton of warning saying that the bot\u2019s messages shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously\n\nYeah sounds like the parent\u2019s fault\n\nWELL MAYBE SOMEONE WHO CLAIMS THEMSELVES AS A PARENT SHOULD START BEING A FUCKING PARENT\n\nMagic 8 Ball.. should I \u2620\ufe0f my parents? Maybe, check back later. \u201cHm ok\u201d\n\nAny person who is mentally healthy would know the difference between reality and Ai. If your child is getting influenced by Ai it is the parent\u2019s job to prevent them from using it. Especially if the child is mentally ill or suffering.\n\nI\u2019m not mentally healthy and I know it\u2019s ai \ud83d\ude2d\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are fairly representative of the community\u2019s response \u2014 dismissive, annoyed, and laced with disdain for people who just don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s worth trying to understand where they\u2019re coming from. Most users appear to use Character.ai without being convinced to harm themselves or others. And a lot of what you encounter using the service feels less like conversation than role-playing, less like developing a relationship than writing something a bit like fan fiction with lots of scenario-building and explicit, scriptlike \u201cHe leans in for a kiss, giggling\u201d stage direction. To give these reflexively defensive users a bit more credit than they\u2019ve earned, you might draw parallels to parental fears over violent or obscene media, like music or movies.\n\nThe more apt comparison for an app like Character.ai is probably to video games, which are popular with kids, frequently violent, and were seen, when new, as particularly dangerous for their novel immersiveness. Young gamers were similarly dismissive of claims that such games led to real-world harms, and evidence supporting such theories has for decades failed to materialize, although the games industry did agree to a degree of self-regulation. As one of those formerly defensive young gamers, I can see where the Character.ai users are coming from. (A couple of decades on, though \u2014 and apologies to my younger self \u2014 I can\u2019t say it feels great that the much larger and more influential games industry was anchored by first-person shooters for as long as it was.)\n\nThe implication here is that this is just the latest in a long line of undersupported moral panics about entertainment products. In the relatively short term, the comparison suggests, the rest of the world will come to see things as they do. Again, there is something to this \u2014 the general public will probably adjust to the presence of chatbots in our daily lives, building and deploying similar chatbots will become technologically trivial, most people will be less dazzled or mystified by the 100th one they encounter than by the first, and attempts to single out character-oriented chatbots for regulation will be legally and conceptually challenging. But there\u2019s also a personal edge in these scornful responses. The user who wrote that \u201cany person who is mentally healthy would know the difference between reality and Ai\u201d posted a few days later in a thread asking whether other users had been brought to tears during a role-play session in Character.ai:\n\nDid that two to three days before, I cried so much I couldn\u2019t continue the role play anymore. It was the story of a prince and his maid both were madly in love and were each other\u2019s first everything. But they both knew they cannot be together forever it was meant to end but still they spent years together happily in a secret relationship \u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cThis roleplay broke me,\u201d the user said. Last month, the poster who joked \u201cI\u2019m not mentally healthy and I know it\u2019s ai\u201d responded to a thread about a Character.ai outage that caused users to think they\u2019d been banned from the service: \u201cI panicked lol I won\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\nThese comments aren\u2019t strictly incompatible with the chatbots-are-pure-entertainment thesis, and I don\u2019t mean to pick on a couple of casual Redditors. But they do suggest that there\u2019s something a little more complicated than simple media consumption going on, something that\u2019s crucial to the appeal not just of Character.ai but services like ChatGPT, too. The idea of suspending disbelief to become immersed in a performance makes more sense in a theater, or with a game controller in hand, than it does when interacting with characters that use first-person pronouns, and whose creators claim to have passed the Turing test and. (Read Josh Dzieza\u2019s reporting on the subject at The Verge for some more frank and honest accounts of the sorts of relationships people can develop with chatbots.) Firms hardly discourage this kind of thinking. When they need to be, they\u2019re mere software companies; the rest of the time, they\u2019ll cultivate the perception among users and investors that they\u2019re building something categorically different, something even they don\u2019t fully understand.\n\nBut there\u2019s no great mystery about what\u2019s happening here. To oversimplify a bit, Character.ai is a tool that attempts to automate different modes of discourse, using existing, collected conversations as a source: When a user messages a persona, an underlying model trained on similar conversations, or on similar genres of conversation, returns a version of the responses most common in its training data. If it\u2019s someone asking an assistant character for help with homework, they\u2019ll probably get what they need and expect; if it\u2019s a teen angry at her parents and discussing suicide with a character instructed to perform as an authentic confidante, they might get something more disturbing, based on terabytes of data containing disturbing conversations between real people. Put another way: If you train a model on decades of the web, and automate and simulate the sorts of conversations that happen on that web, and release it to a bunch of young users, it\u2019s going to say some extremely fucked up things to kids, some of whom are going to take those things seriously. The question isn\u2019t how the bots work; it is \u2014 to go back to what the parents filing lawsuits against Character.ai might be wondering \u2014 Why the fuck did someone build this? The most satisfying answer on offer is probably because they could.\n\nCharacter.ai deals with particular and in some cases acute versions of some of the core problems with generative AI as acknowledged by companies and their critics alike. Its characters will be influenced by the biases in the material on which they were trained: long, private conversations with young users. Attempts at setting rules or boundaries for the chatbots will be thwarted by the sheer length and depth of these private conversations, which might go on for thousands of messages, again, with young users. A common story about how AI might bring about disaster is that as it becomes more advanced, it will use its ability to deceive users to achieve objectives that aren\u2019t aligned with those of its creators or humanity in general. These lawsuits, which are the first of their kind but certainly won\u2019t be the last, attempt to tell a similar story of a chatbot becoming powerful enough to persuade someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t and that isn\u2019t in their best interest. It\u2019s the imagined AI apocalypse writ small, at the scale of the family."

The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there. What did they capture?\"\n\nCheck Out the Viral Video\n\nSince then, the video has gone viral, sparking a mix of reactions. Some viewers suggest that the figures could merely be people in a snowy landscape, while others propose more outlandish theories, including the idea that the sight could be steam rising from industrial gases or fog.\n\nA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?#theparanormalchic #alien #airline #paranormal #ufo #fyp pic.twitter.com/CARF6XFGxD \u2014 Myra Moore- The Paranormal Chic (@t_paranorm_chic) December 30, 2024\n\nThe clip\u2019s lack of clear location and timing has only added to the mystery, leaving many to wonder whether the sighting could have an otherworldly explanation. \"What did they capture?\" Moore asked, encouraging her followers to share their opinions and theories. The video has since gone viral on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where users are divided between humorous interpretations and more serious discussions about the potential implications of the footage.\n\nUsers Reaction to the Viral Post\n\nThe most conclusive explanation of the video was given by a twitter user with an image and he said that, \u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks.\u201d\n\nAnother one said, \u201cThat\u2019s wild. Are those angels? Something big is coming. 2025 is going to be a crazy year. Buckle up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are Cloud storage engineers checking servers and data in the cloud.

            "article_content": "In a discovery that feels like science brought fiction to life, researchers at the University of Toronto claim to have shown that 'negative time' is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible phenomenon. In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

            "article_content": "If you are still in awe of Generative AI solutions such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Meta AI, and Gemini, you are in for more surprises. OpenAI, for one, is talking about much more powerful and deeper Large Language Models (LLMs) that promise to become an integral part of our daily activities.\n\nImagine a customer wanting to do a banking transaction, say checking their bank balance. He can pose that question to ChatGPT\u2019s advanced model, and if the bank has adopted the solution, it can start a conversation, access the customer\u2019s account by verifying it by sending an OTP to their registered KYC contact numbers, and answer the queries.\n\nThis enhances the customer experience and allows banks to handle a larger volume of queries with fewer resources.\n\nSimilarly, HR departments can sift through a huge number of resumes using the advanced models. By simply posing a few filters (experience, geography, etc.), it can help the HR departments can shortlist candidates in no time. \u201cYou can even schedule interview schedules using the solution,\u201d Atty Eleti, a member of technical staff at OpenAI, has said.\n\nDemonstrating the capabilities of some of the OpenAI\u2019s advanced models at T-Hub here on Friday, he said that the upcoming AI solutions would continue to become smarter, moving beyond simply answering questions to actually performing tasks and solving complex problems. Talking on the \u2018Unlocking OpenAI\u2019s potential for India\u2019, he spoke on some advanced models such as O-Series (\u2018Reasoning\u2019 models) GPT-4 Mini, and Sora. While the reasoning models demonstrate an ability to \u2018think\u2019 before responding, GPT-4 Mini is a more cost-effective version of GPT-4, and Sora helps users create realistic HD videos simply by providing text prompts.\n\nEleti said the future of AI interaction would extend beyond text and voice to encompass a broader range of modalities, including video, physical motion, and even social cues.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming AI models will dynamically generate user interfaces, control robots, and interact with the physical world in more sophisticated ways, blurring the lines between the digital and real,\u201d he said.\n\nAs AI technology advances, it will become more affordable and accessible to a wider population. He said OpenAI was committed to reducing the cost of its models and making them available through various platforms, ensuring that everyone can benefit from the transformative power of AI.\n\nPegging the user base for LLMs at about 0.5-1 billion, he said there a large number of people in the world that are yet to access these services.\n\nIndia plans\n\nHe said India emerged as the second biggest base for the US company in terms of the user base and the number of developers.\n\n\u201cIndia is a key market for its technology, with the country boasting the second-largest user base for its products. Millions of Indians are already using OpenAI\u2019s tools for various purposes, from education and personal productivity to business operations.\n\nHe said the company has significantly invested in improving its models\u2019 support for Indian languages, including Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, and Urdu. This has resulted in an 80 per cent reduction in token counts for these languages, leading to faster processing times and lower costs.\n\nHe said the company was working with Indian businesses to demonstrate the potential of AI and encourage its adoption. He cited the examples of 10Bed ICU, which uses OpenAI\u2019s technology to transcribe doctor-patient conversations and summarise patient files, and HealthifyMe, an AI-powered nutrition tracker that provides personalised health insights.\n\nLater, an OpenAI team met with Telangana government officials to discuss how to leverage AI for effective governance and enhanced citizen service delivery. This session aimed to foster collaboration between OpenAI and government stakeholders and highlight AI\u2019s pivotal role in driving impactful public service solutions.\n\nJayesh Ranjan, Special Chief Secretary, Department of Information Technology, Electronics & Communications (ITE&C, Govt of Telangana), said the government would continue collaborating with OpenAI to promote AI innovation and opportunities.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

            "article_content": "OpenAI's o3 AI model recently achieved 85% on the ARC-AGI benchmark, similar to human-level performance. Though impressive, experts caution that it does not necessarily mean true human-level intelligence because its architecture and methods are undisclosed.\n\nOpenAI has just released its o3 series of AI models that focus on reasoning capabilities. So far, they have demonstrated excellent performance in internal benchmarks and raised questions about the potential for such intelligence. Even though scores are impressive, one needs to see whether the o3 model reaches human-level intelligence or if it is merely an improved version of earlier models.\n\nThe o3 model scored 85 percent on the ARC-AGI benchmark, a test that measures reasoning and spatial understanding. This score is 30 percent better than the previous best score, and the result matches the average score of humans on the same test. This achievement may suggest that o3 is close to human-level reasoning, but the reality may be more complex.\n\nWhat Does This Benchmark Score Really Mean?\n\nDespite the stellar score, however, we do not immediately believe that the capability of the model o3 was equivalent to humans. The scoring is not detailed enough to judge the capabilities and capabilities of AI. Open AI has not given detailed information about what architecture, methodology, or databases were used during training for creating o3 and therefore cannot pinpoint whether it can be called really intelligent.\n\nThe o3 model is the continuation of the o-series. It is an improvement on its architecture rather than a complete overhaul. For example, the o1 series introduced the method of test-time compute, allowing the model to use extra time for processing solutions and testing theories. GPT-4o was also a fine-tuned version of GPT-4.\n\nConsidering the fact that OpenAI is reported to be developing GPT-5, the o3 model does not seem to be a new architectural design. Rather, the company has probably been optimizing the model for better performance in reasoning tasks.\n\nThe ARC-AGI benchmark is comprised of grid-based pattern recognition questions that require reasoning and spatial reasoning. Good performance on such a test would mean an AI model having an excellent amount of robust dataset focused on logic and reasoning. But the test is not that simple-it has been thought so before. If that were possible, the score of the previous best would have been much higher. The previous best scored at 55 percent, which indicates that o3 left the others way behind with its well-refined techniques and algorithms.\n\nIs o3 Really Near AGI?\n\nWhile an 85 percent score for o3 is quite impressive, it does not imply that the model has reached AGI. Developing AGI would be a far greater breakthrough than this and would have a very significant impact on the partnership of OpenAI with Microsoft. If OpenAI had indeed achieved AGI, the company would probably have made a much more public announcement.\n\nAI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, have also emphasized that AGI remains years away. If the o3 model were close to AGI, OpenAI would likely be more transparent about this milestone.\n\nThe o3 model is a step forward in AI development, but the pursuit of true AGI is still a long way off.\n\nALSO READ | Apple Agrees to Pay $95 Million to Settle Siri Eavesdropping Lawsuit"

            "article_content": "Health tech companies focused on behavioral health are confident that reimbursement trends favor them in 2025.\n\nPayment flexibilities for telehealth, hospital-at-home care and remote prescribing have been temporarily extended until March 31. The changes will prolong COVID-19-era payment for remote care across all specialties.\n\nRelated: CMS deals telehealth a win, but sector still needs Congress' help\n\nFor many in mental health tech, new reimbursement codes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 November physician payment rule are an even bigger deal.\n\nThe codes reimburse providers for using digital mental health treatment applications or devices that have been cleared or granted De Novo authorization by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nWhile the codes are narrow in scope, analysts said the move signifies a larger recognition among CMS and commercial insurers that virtual platforms treating mental health should be reimbursed.\n\n\u201cThere has been a shortage of good mental health providers, and it is easy to argue that mental health services can be delivered in a virtual environment. No examination is needed,\u201d said Carrie Nixon, co-founder and managing partner of Nixon Gwilt Law, which works with digital health companies. \u201cThose factors have made mental and behavioral health the obvious jumping off point for all types of virtual, synchronous and asynchronous methods of delivering care.\u201d\n\nDigital therapeutics companies, which develop programs that can treat patients primarily through smartphone applications, have struggled because of a lack of reimbursement, said Andy Molnar, CEO of industry trade group the Digital Therapeutics Association.\n\nThe codes will be a lifeline for many behavioral health-focused digital therapeutics companies such as Big Health. The company has two FDA-cleared apps for treating insomnia and anxiety and is in line to benefit from CMS\u2019 new codes, said CEO Yael Berman.\n\nThere has been demand for Big Health\u2019s apps from providers looking for first-line treatment for sleeping disorders but no reimbursement, she said. The lack of reimbursement has limited its growth opportunities.\n\n\u201cReimbursement has really been the key barrier because we've had providers reaching out over the years, but there was no way to get them to be able to offer it to their patients unless it was free,\u201d Berman said.\n\nJoe Perekupka, CEO of digital therapeutics company Freespira, said the shortage of mental health providers requires a more progressive approach from the federal government in treating the mental health crisis. Perekupka said with these codes, he hope CMS is starting to recognize this need.\n\nFreespira, which offers a mobile health to reduce symptoms of panic disorder, panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder, is unsure its services fit within the scope of CMS\u2019 codes, Perekupka said. Still, he predicted the codes will open the door to expand for broader digital mental health treatments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a monumental shift in the philosophy at CMS,\u201d Perekupka said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a big shot of adrenaline into the arm of digital mental health treatment.\n\nOutside the therapeutics space, companies such as Brightside Health and Talkspace have seen a shift in mentality from the federal government. In May, virtual mental health company Talkspace began rolling out its services to Medicare members. The company is expecting Medicare members to adopt the program this year when it starts marketing their services, said Erin Boyd, chief growth officer.\n\nIn addition to changes at the federal level, more commercial insurers are actively engaging with mental health tech companies, Boyd said. Talkspace has shifted its focus over the past few years from a direct-to-consumer payment model to working with commercial insurers and employers. The payer business accounted for more than 65% of its revenue through the first nine months of 2024.\n\n\u201cAfter COVID, it just made sense to be in as many networks as possible,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cWe changed our marketing focus two years ago to really emphasize that you could use your insurance to get Talkspace, and that's been significant in changing the amount of registered users we have on the platform.\u201d\n\nWith the opportunities increasing for reimbursement, companies must prove their worth to CMS and commercial insurers, said Molnar at the trade group. If the codes aren\u2019t used or the outcomes data isn't showing a strong return on investment, CMS will move slowly to expand coverage, he said."

            "article_content": "An app's performance is key to make users want to use it, say Meta engineers Dave LaMacchia and Jason Patterson. This includes making the app lightning-fast, battery-efficient, and reliable across a range of devices and connectivity conditions.\n\nTo improve Threads performance, Meta engineers measured how fast the app launches, how easy it is to post a photo or video, how often it crashes, and how many bug reports people filed. To this aim, they defined a number of metrics: frustrating image-render experience (FIRE), time-to-network content (TTNC), and creation-publish success rate (cPSR).\n\nFIRE is the percentage of people who experience a frustrating image-render experience, which may lead to them leaving the app while the image is rendering across the network. Roughly, FIRE is defined as the quotient of the number of users leaving the app before an image is fully rendered by the sum of all users attempting to display that image. Measuring this metric allows Threads developers to detect any regressions in how images are loading for users.\n\nTime-to-network content (TTNC) is roughly the time required for the app to launch and display the user's feed. Long loading time is another experience killer that may lead users to abandon the app. Reducing the app's binary size is paramount to keeping the binary small:\n\nEvery time someone tries to commit code to Threads, they\u2019re alerted if that code change would increase our app\u2019s binary size above a configured threshold.\n\nAdditionally, they removed unnecessary code and graphics assets from the app bundle, resulting in a binary one-quarter the size of Instagram.\n\nAs to navigation latency, this is possibly even more critical than launch time. Meta engineers carried through A/B tests to find out that:\n\nWith the smallest latency injection, the impact was small or negligible for some views, but the largest injections had negative effects across the board. People would read fewer posts, post less often themselves, and in general interact less with the app.\n\nTo ensure that no changes cause a regression in navigation latency, Meta engineers created SLATE, a logger system that tracks relevant events like triggers of a new navigation, the UI being built, activity spinners, and content from the network or an error being displayed.\n\nIt\u2019s implemented using a set of common components that are the foundation for a lot of our UI and a system that measures performance by setting \u201cmarkers\u201d in code for specific events. Typically these markers are created with a specific purpose in mind.\n\nCreation-publish success rate (cPSR) measures how likely it is for an user to successfully complete the process of posting some content. On iOS, posting a video or large photo is especially tricky, since the user could background the app after posting their content without waiting for the upload to complete, in which case the app may be terminated by the OS.\n\nHere, the approach taken by Meta was aimed at improving the user experience in those cases when posting failed. This was accomplished by introducing a new feature, called Drafts, to allow users to manage failed posts in more flexible ways instead of just providing the option to retry or abort the operation.\n\nWe discovered that 26 percent fewer people submitted bug reports about posting if they had Drafts. The feature was clearly making a difference.\n\nAnother approach was trying to reduce perceived latency, as opposed to absolute latency, showing a request has been received when the data upload completes but before it\u2019s been processed and published.\n\nLast but not least, Meta engineers saw a great improvement in app stability after they adopted Swift's complete concurrency, which, they say, does a great job at preventing data races and reducing hard-to-debug problems caused by data races."

            "article_content": "Keele University\u2019s Lewis Endlar examines some of the biggest tech developments expected in the next 12 months, from blockchain to 6G.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, 45 years is not a long time. Back in 1980, it would take me three weeks to run a computer program, written in the programming language Cobol, that worked using punched cards. Each card represented one line of code, and it required multiple re-punches to correct errors. Eventually, I would have a working program that did something useful.\n\nHow times have quickly changed in technology \u2013 now, my mobile phone has vast processing capability compared to the machine that processed that Cobol program. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, that same phone is able to instantly translate between languages on a live call, among many other features.\n\nWith eye-catching announcements being made all the time, what can we expect in 2025 from the world of technology? Here are seven developments to look out for.\n\nAI agents come into their own\n\nUnsurprisingly, we\u2019re likely to see further important developments in AI. One area that\u2019s likely to take off is the use of AI agents. These are intelligent programs that are given objectives by humans and work out the best ways to achieve those objectives.\n\nAgents can write computer code, which could have a big impact on the way that tech companies work and could allow people without advanced coding skills to develop programs, apps or games.\n\nYou could also see car plants with no people, running with robots operated by AI agents. In theory, mortgage applications could be assessed and approved by agent technology. Individual apps on a smartphone could be replaced by an agent interface that performs multiple tasks for the user.\n\nA combination of agent technology with robotics could be revolutionary. We are reaching a point where robots don\u2019t just emulate the tasks of humans but are reasoning and answering to us directly.\n\nOne candidate for hosting AI agent technology is Optimus, a humanoid robot built by Tesla. Elon Musk has said that the electric car maker will start using Optimus for tasks within the company from 2025. He added that the automaton could be ready for sale to other businesses by 2026.\n\nAgents are tailor-made for industry tasks such as project management. The consulting firm Gartner suggests that by 2030, some 80pc of project management tasks will be run by AI.\n\nCustomisation, with help from AI\n\nIn education, the focus has traditionally been on linear programmes of study, with pre-determined entry and exit points lasting a number of years. Imagine a course of study that is uniquely tailored to individual students based on their experience, skills and abilities. Bespoke degree programmes centred around the student are already being explored in the US with AI.\n\nThese are not just bespoke with regard to the content and curriculum, but also in recognising the special needs of the student or indeed how the learner may feel at any one time. This can include AI that adjusts the learning activity and study based on how much sleep you had last night, which is linked to smartwatch data.\n\nEducation isn\u2019t the only area where AI could help with customisation. The management consultancy Accenture suggests that private companies will be able to train their own, custom large language models, the technology behind AI chatbots such as ChatGPT. These could be trained with data specific to particular business areas, making them more effective for those firms. But these companies would have to use billions of pieces of data. We\u2019ll see progress towards this objective in 2025.\n\nSmall language models (SLMs) are being developed to perform precise tasks more efficiently. They don\u2019t need to be trained on as much data and require less computing power. This means they can be used more easily on so-called \u201cedge devices\u201d \u2013 smartphones, tablets and laptops \u2013 without relying on computing resources hosted in the cloud.\n\nTowards practical quantum computers\n\nDevelopments in quantum computing could lead to machines that can solve complex tasks that are beyond the capability of most classical computers. Researchers have moved away from trying to break records for the number of basic processing units, called qubits, and towards correcting the errors that quantum computers are currently prone to. This is a step towards practical quantum computers that have some useful advantage over classical machines.\n\nBlending physical and virtual worlds\n\nAugmented reality, virtual reality and mixed reality could be used more widely. Virtual reality immerses users in a computer-generated world. Augmented reality superimposes computer-generated elements onto the real world, while the latter remains visible. Mixed reality refers to a set of immersive technologies including augmented reality, that provide different \u201cblends\u201d of physical and virtual worlds.\n\nThere are already a number of head-mounted devices (HMDs) that can support these technologies. These include Apple\u2019s Vision Pro and Meta\u2019s Quest headset. In 2025, we\u2019re likely to see new products and refinements from the likes of Meta, Apple and others.\n\nBenefits of blockchain\n\nBlockchain technology, which allows records to be stored across a network of computers, is set to affect supply chains and different sectors from healthcare to finance. Blockchain increases transparency and traceability, allowing for the tracking of products from origin to consumer. It also offers enhanced security and improved efficiency with automated processes.\n\nPatient data in healthcare could be made more secure with blockchain technology. The exchange of data could become seamless and medical supplies could be tracked. Financial transactions could be made more robust, faster and cheaper and there would be a greater degree of financial inclusion. This would provide access to a wider group who may not have had banking or lending services before.\n\nThe dawn of 6G communications\n\nWe will enjoy faster connectivity, with the introduction of 6G wireless communication networks. The process of standardising 6G technology will begin in 2025. Clear 6G global standards and compatibility between networks is vital for the technology\u2019s success.\n\nMore advanced self-driving technology\n\nSelf-driving vehicles are also set to see a number of advancements going forward. Self-driving cars are classified into six levels, according to their autonomy \u2013 from level 0 (fully manual) to level 5 (fully autonomous). Current self-driving taxis deployed in US cities such as San Francisco are at level 4 (high driving automation).\n\nThey can handle most driving tasks without human input but with some restrictions. In 2025, we\u2019re likely to see progress towards level 5. This is classified as full autonomy and describes vehicles that operate without any human intervention. Mercedes will increase the speed of its Drive Pilot self-driving system in 2025 and Tesla is developing its own robotaxi, which should be available \u201cbefore 2027\u201d, according to Elon Musk.\n\nWe can expect technology to be able to achieve tasks that used to be the exclusive domain of humans. It will be able to complete work tasks and report back. This will lead to efficiencies and big changes to work. We\u2019ll also see technology that enhances our leisure time and quality of life.\n\nBy Lewis Endlar\n\nLewis Endar is a lecturer in business and programme director of the MSc in project management at the Keele Business School in Keele University.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the knowledge you need to succeed.

Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

            "article_content": "Philadelphia is widely recognized as one of the nation\u2019s leading centers for innovation and research, fueled by flourishing technology, education, medicine, and life sciences sectors.\n\nAt the heart of this thriving landscape, Temple University serves as a vital anchor. With a culture deeply rooted in innovation, the institution fosters an environment where a community of faculty, researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors turns ideas into reality. Together, they advance new products to the marketplace and found companies with societal impact.\n\nFrom new treatments for autoimmune disorders and gum disease to life-saving solutions for blood clots and electric vehicle safety, Temple researchers are at the forefront of science that matters. Here, we spoke with four teams that grew out of Temple\u2019s robust innovation ecosystem about how their products and technologies aim to make a big difference in the world. And right here in Philly.\n\nA Rapid, Lifesaving Solution for Dangerous Blood Clots\n\nDr. Riyaz Bashir has developed a novel technology to treat potentially deadly pulmonary embolisms, in a groundbreaking procedure that may be completed in less than an hour.\n\nPulmonary embolisms \u2014 blood clots that commonly form in the deep veins of the legs, then break off and travel into the vessels of the lungs \u2014 are gargantuan. Many times the size of other clots, and their sheer mass present a unique challenge for treatment: the amount of blood-thinning medication needed to dissolve them can also lead to excessive bleeding and time in the ICU, as a result.\n\n\u201cWe learned that if you fissure a clot to allow the patient\u2019s own healthy blood to flow through it and combine this with a small dose of clot-dissolving medicine, that rapidly dissolves it.\u201d Dr. Riyaz Bashir\n\nPulmonary embolisms \u2014 blood clots that commonly form in the deep veins of the legs, then break off and travel into the vessels of the lungs \u2014 are gargantuan. Many times the size of clots that cause a stroke, and their sheer mass, present a unique challenge for treatment: the amount of blood-thinning medication needed to dissolve them can also lead to excessive bleeding and time in the ICU, as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Riyaz Bashir, a professor at Temple University\u2019s Lewis Katz School of Medicine and a cardiologist at Temple University Hospital, was treating patients with embolisms at his practice day after day when he thought of a better treatment strategy than what was available at the time. He cofounded Thrombolex Inc. to develop and commercialize a solution to the challenge. The BASHIR\u2122 Endovascular Catheter consists of an expandable infusion basket that, when inserted into the site of the clot, cuts multiple fissures through the clot\u2019s mass to immediately restore the flow of blood.\n\n\u201cWe learned that if you allow a patient\u2019s own healthy blood to flow through a clot, that rapidly dissolves it,\u201d Bashir says, \u201cbecause it brings the body\u2019s own clot-dissolving chemicals into the clot.\u201d Clot-busting drugs can then be injected directly at the site, delivering targeted relief and reducing the risk of side effects. In independent studies, treatment with the catheter can be completed in less than an hour, compared to five hours for traditional methods that require an ICU admission. The procedure also resulted in a 29% reduction in the size of the blockage in just 48 hours. The device is now FDA-approved.\n\nAbout one-in-one-thousand people will develop a PE; the rate is consistent across different countries and demographics. One of the key benefits of this innovative technology is its ease of use. \u201cMy goal was that it should also benefit developing countries where they don\u2019t have the advanced facilities we do in the U.S.,\u201d Bashir says. In the United States, a few hundred thousand people annually stand to benefit from his invention. \u201cFor eight billion people worldwide,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can do the math as to how many lives we could potentially save.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Dr. Riyaz Bashir\u2019s work on treating pulmonary embolisms.\n\nA New, More Natural Approach to Drug Discovery\n\nDrs. Mark Feitelson and Alla Arzumanyan are using substances produced by the body to treat hepatitis, liver disease, and more.\n\nMuch ink has been spilled in recent years about the importance of gut biomes. It\u2019s often reported that the balance of good bacteria in our digestive tracts can affect everything from the strength of our immune systems to our energy levels and mood. But that may only be scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible with the molecules in our gut. Researchers are discovering that gut metabolites may have broader applications, like being used to treat conditions affecting other parts of the body including the skin, the liver, and the colon.\n\nSFA Therapeutics Inc., co founded by the Temple University researchers Mark Feitelson and Alla Arzumanyan, is drawing upon gut metabolites to treat disease and to advance our understanding of just how wide-ranging their applications may be. \u201cThe idea first came to me in about 2013,\u201d Feitelson, a professor of biology in Temple\u2019s College of Science and Technology, says. \u201cWe came across a scientific article about using bacterial metabolites to treat mice with colitis. And I thought, that\u2019s very interesting. You can give these things to a mouse orally, and it acts in the intestine; but what about everywhere else?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nice thing about these substances is we don\u2019t have to optimize them, evolution already has. This is a fundamentally different way of thinking about how to discover and develop drugs.\u201d Dr. Mark Feitelson\n\nIn his research, Feitelson saw promising results in using metabolites to treat viral hepatitis and chronic liver disease. \u201cIt turns out a lot of the bad players involved in inflammation in the liver overlap with the bad players elsewhere,\u201d Feitelson says. It was Arzumanyan\u2019s idea to attempt treating psoriasis. In phase one trials, 92% of patients experienced improvement, and the team now has an array of patents for their compounds. They are exploring treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia, and lung damage caused by COVID-19 infection, among other diseases.\n\nOne of the big advantages of SFA\u2019s work is the potential for fewer side effects compared with traditional treatments. \u201cThe nice thing about these substances is we don\u2019t have to optimize them, evolution already has. This is a fundamentally different way of thinking about how to discover and develop drugs, and that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s also applicable to many different types of diseases,\u201d Feitelson says. Compared to conventional drugs, SFA\u2019s treatments act more harmoniously with the body. \u201cThe defining feature of our drug is modulation, rather than suppression,\u201d Arzumanyan, an associate professor in Temple\u2019s College of Science and Technology, says. \u201cWhen big pharma companies design a drug, they usually pick a molecule and design a drug that suppresses it below the baseline, causing side effects. Our drug brings them back to what they should be normally.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Drs. Mark Feitelson and Alla Arzumanyan\u2019s work to transform the treatment of autoimmune disorders and more.\n\nEnsuring the Safety of Electric Cars, for a Greener World\n\nDr. Elham Sahraei seeks to understand how lithium batteries respond during a collision.\n\nAs the world rapidly adopts the use of batteries over fossil fuels, safety is at the front of many people\u2019s minds. Stories about an electric car catching fire garner outsized attention from media and consumers, because the technology is new and unfamiliar \u2014 even if the risks aren\u2019t any greater compared with gas-powered vehicles. Understanding and improving the safety of electric batteries isn\u2019t important just for protecting users, it\u2019s also crucial for accelerating their mainstream adoption and reducing overall carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cBecause this is new technology, it\u2019s less understood than conventional vehicles.\u201d Dr. Elham Sahraei\n\nElham Sahraei, an associate professor in Temple\u2019s College of Engineering, is the director of the university\u2019s Electric Vehicle Safety Lab, dedicated to understanding what happens to electric batteries under extreme stress. The lab\u2019s experiments investigate what happens to batteries, like the kind that are used in electric vehicles, when they\u2019re impacted or punctured. The evidence gleaned from these experiments is combined with government vehicle crash safety data in order to model how the battery pack in a car is likely to behave during a collision. \u201cBecause this is new technology, it\u2019s less understood than conventional vehicles,\u201d Sahraei says. \u201cThe industry is very cautious, [and] trying to add lots of protection around the batteries to compensate for that lack of understanding.\u201d\n\nA better understanding of what the riskiest scenarios are for electric vehicles will produce better protections. Think of how passenger safety has improved for gas-powered cars: these vehicles were once rigid steel boxes, but now, modern cars include crumple zones that absorb and redirect the force of a crash around the driver and the passengers. Sahraei and her team\u2019s work entails producing similar concepts for protecting batteries. Now incubating at iNest, Temple\u2019s innovation hub, her early stage startup, Inovele LLC, is providing models and testing for vehicle makers to simulate and assess the performance of their own designs. It\u2019s a vital step for enticing us all into a cleaner, greener world.\n\nLearn more about Elham Sahraei\u2019s work innovating for safer roadways.\n\nA Revolutionary Nonsurgical Treatment for Periodontal Disease\n\nDrs. Santiago Orrego and Carolina Montoya\u2019s gel uses electricity harnessed by the movement of the jaw to treat periodontal disease by growing bone and controlling infection.\n\nIt sounds straight out of science fiction: a miraculous gel that helps the body regrow bone in the periodontal pocket. One weird thing about the human body is how it naturally regrows some parts, but not others: your hair comes back when cut, your bones will heal from breaks, but your teeth \u2014 not so much. Gum disease occurs when microbes trigger gum inflammation, causing the underlying bone to begin a process of self-destruction. In advanced cases, the bone below the tooth dies, leading the tooth to fall out. Current periodontitis treatments involve surgery, but now, there is a nonsurgical solution.\n\nAmbilux Dental Gel, a smart hydrogel, developed by Drs. Santiago Orrego and Carolina Montoya at Temple University, aims to reverse the effects of gum disease when deposited in the space between the gum and teeth. The gel contains piezoelectric materials, which convert the movement of one\u2019s jaw into an electrical charge that stimulates bone growth. All it takes is a few squirts with a syringe. Oral Biolife Inc. licensed the technology from Temple and is among the first to translate piezoelectric materials for dentistry. Their novel product is the result of many moving parts and paths of research, combining dentistry and engineering.\n\n\u201cWe work closely with practicing dentists to produce bioengineering-driven solutions for the challenges they face in the clinic.\u201d Dr. Santiago Orrego\n\nOrrego, an assistant professor with dual appointments in Temple\u2019s Kornberg School of Dentistry and College of Engineering, originally worked with piezoelectrics in his postdoctoral studies \u2014 developing, for example, a flag that generated enough electricity to charge batteries when it fluttered. Later, he began collaborating with Montoya, a research associate in Kornberg\u2019s Smart Biomaterials Lab, to apply those materials to treating dental disease. \u201cInside the body, employing piezoelectricity is a fairly new concept,\u201d Montoya says. \u201cCarolina and I are engineers by training,\u201d Orrego says. \u201cWe work closely with lots of practicing dentists to create the synergy to produce solutions for the difficult dental challenges they face.\u201d\n\nAnd the benefits don\u2019t stop at humans: periodontal disease affects about 80% of dogs, making this technology a potentially groundbreaking veterinary treatment, for the health of everyone\u2019s good boys and girls \u2014 a promising enough prospect to make anyone smile.\n\nLearn more about Drs. Santiago Orrego and Carolina Montoya\u2019s work regenerating bone tissue lost to periodontal disease.\n\nDennis Tang is a journalist, a novelist, and a creative writing professor based in Brooklyn, New York."

            "article_content": "The sun sends out a constant flow of charged particles called the solar wind, which ultimately travels past all the planets to some three times the distance to Pluto before being impeded by the interstellar medium. This forms a giant bubble around the sun and its planets, known as the heliosphere.\n\nIf our solar system were to lose a few moons or even a planet, the difference might be hard to notice\u2014but lose the sun, and everything changes. Despite its role as neighborhood linchpin, however, scientists still have a whole host of questions about how the sun works and how it influences our daily life on Earth and in space. And 2025 is poised to play a key role in getting answers.\n\nThree factors are combining to make the coming year particularly exciting for the discipline known as heliophysics: the sun\u2019s natural activity cycle, a fleet of spacecraft launches and the release of a blueprint designed to guide the next decade of work in the field.\n\nRight now the sun is in the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, where scientists expect it to remain for perhaps another year or so before its activity begins to wane. And although the current Solar Cycle 25 isn\u2019t breaking any records, it has produced a host of solar flares and other spectacular outbursts that scientists have been able to monitor with recent new instruments. Those observers include both the largest solar telescope ever built and a spacecraft that has made the closest approach to the sun in history.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nAnd this year those groundbreaking projects will get plenty of new company; NASA alone expects to launch half a dozen missions to study the sun and the myriad ways it shapes the solar system. Among them are the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, or IMAP, designed to help scientists map the outer limits of the sun\u2019s sphere of influence; the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers, or ESCAPADE, a pair of spacecraft that will orbit Mars to study the Red Planet\u2019s experience of space weather; and the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, or PUNCH, mission, which combines four small satellites orbiting Earth to study the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, or corona.\n\nMoreover, U.S. heliophysicists have a new so-called decadal report, a blueprint for the coming decade that sketches out a host of national science priorities, that was released last month and that federal agencies will begin implementing in the coming year. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about it,\u201d says Joe Westlake, a heliophysicist and director of the Heliophysics Division of NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate.\n\n\u201cThese decadals are aspirational views of our future,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s some really good stuff in this one.\u201d\n\nFor future spacecraft missions, the report recommends that NASA pursue two large projects. One mission would consist of a total of 26 spacecraft: Two would be stationed high above our planet\u2019s poles in circular orbits and would take images of auroras and Earth\u2019s magnetic field from afar. The rest would be located in more elliptical orbits that pass through the geomagnetic field, where they would gather local observations of its strength and nearby plasma. \u201cTwenty-plus spacecraft and the ability to put those all together at the same time, looking down, looking up and collecting observations, is going to be such an incredible dataset tool for us,\u201d says Nicki Rayl, acting deputy director of the Heliophysics Division. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be groundbreaking.\u201d\n\nThe second large project would be a spacecraft designed to swoop over both poles of the sun several times over the course of an entire 11-year solar activity cycle. A current NASA mission, the Parker Solar Probe, has been diving ever closer to the sun\u2019s surface, but it has stuck to observing the sun over its equatorial region. Meanwhile an ongoing European Space Agency mission called Solar Orbiter has provided only partial views of the solar poles. Consequently, our star\u2019s poles remain mysterious regions, even as they play a key role in the evolution of the sun\u2019s magnetic field. \u201cGoing to the poles of the sun is hard, and it\u2019s a tricky environment to get into,\u201d Rayl says. \u201cThat\u2019s the next unknown territory.\u201d\n\nOn Earth, these ambitious missions would be augmented by the Next Generation Global Oscillations Network Group (ngGONG), which builds on the existing GONG group of observatories that began work in 1995. These observatories are spread around the world to keep the sun in their sights throughout the day, and they use a technique called helioseismology to study the solar interior by observing waves passing through it, much as geologists employ seismology to study the interior of Earth.\n\n\u201cSome of these audacious, incredible goals that are in the decadal help us really jump into the unknowns and do some discovery science,\u201d Rayl says. And in the meantime, she notes, the missions launching in the coming year will yield ever more insights\u2014and new questions to ask\u2014about the sun. \u201cI\u2019m just thrilled that we\u2019re going to be in the data-collection mode,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s go time.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Mensent Photography/Getty Images\n\nThere I was, minding my own bidness, watching Formula 1 videos on IG. \ud83e\udd70\n\nSam Altman pops up, talking about the future of AI as it relates to business owners.\n\nHe said that one day, we could see a one-person billion-dollar company. \ud83d\ude31\n\nMy first thought was, \"Dude is wilding.\" Then I thought, \"What if he's right?\"\n\nI promised myself I'd explore all new tech with an open mind since I learned my lesson from missing out on Bitcoin.\n\nAlso: I invested $50 in Bitcoin in 2022, and it's been a ride. Here's how much I have now\n\n(I'm still salty about not becoming a Bitcoin trillionaire from a $25 investment) \ud83d\ude2b\n\nUnderstandably, that missed opportunity still haunts me, but let's save that story for another day.\n\nSo, with all this in mind, I decided to do some detective work.\n\nToday, I will share my fascinating findings on AI tools that help everyday people like you and me build a software company without knowing how to code. \ud83e\udd2f\n\nIn this article, I'll also share:\n\nWhat tools to use\n\nA few ideas I have around what to build\n\nTips and tricks on how to get your first users\n\nI'll even give you some insight into the tool I built to help me with my workflow.\n\nBuckle up. This is going to be good.\n\nQuick intro\n\nIf you're new to my work, my name is Lester, but feel free to call me Les. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm a founder with a successful exit, but at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer. Like most people who have started an online business, I wish I knew how to code.\n\nAlso: AI isn't the next big thing - here's what is\n\nStarting out, I had to choose a direction: focus on the technical side of building products or lean into understanding people and how to reach them.\n\nI chose marketing as it aligned more with my strengths and interests. \ud83e\udd13\n\nThat said, you no longer have to make that choice. With a prompt, AI can help you create software and bring your ideas to life.\n\nMy experience using low-code/no-code\n\nSo, what are these magical AI tools where you input a prompt, and out comes a billion-dollar software company? \ud83e\ude84\n\nWhile there are a few out there, we will focus on Replit today.\n\nScreenshot by Lester Mapp/ZDNET\n\nReplit Agent is a tool that helps you build software using simple instructions. You can tell it what kind of app or website you want, and it will create it for you automatically. It works in the cloud, so you don't need to install anything on your computer. This makes it easy for anyone to make their programs quickly, even if they don't know how to code.\n\nReplit's claim to fame is \"No code needed.\" Its website says: \"Tell Replit Agent your app or website idea, and it will build it for you automatically. It's like having an entire team of software engineers on demand, ready to build what you need through a simple chat.\"\n\nBold claim!\n\nAlso: 3 lucrative side hustles you can start right now with OpenAI's Sora video generator\n\nBut for $25 bucks, I gave it a shot. You ain't gonna Bitcoin me twice in one lifetime. \ud83d\ude24\n\nWhat happened next? I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst, let me explain my workflow. A big part of my job is sending emails, especially cold emails.\n\nYou can use many services to find someone's email, but I have a personal beef with some of them. They're ridiculously overpriced, and I don't negotiate with terrorists. So, I do the process manually.\n\nSure, it's not the best use of my time, but I'm a man of principle, dammit! \ud83d\ude20\n\nNow, the manual process is time-consuming but simple. Most businesses use the same structure for all employee emails.\n\nFor example, joe.smith@awesomecompany.com or john@awesomecompany.com.\n\nOnce you know the format and the name of your prospect, the next step is to verify it's an actual email. Again, there are plenty of services that can do this for you.\n\nAlso: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning\n\nDoing it manually is a pain, so I asked someone on our dev team to help me automate this process.\n\nAfter a quick review, they said, \"It'll take three weeks to build.\" Bruh!\ud83d\ude44\n\nThat didn't sit right with my spirit.\n\nThen it hit me: \"I wonder if Replit could help me build my email finder.\"\n\nI built my tool with a few prompts and started using it the same day.\n\nScreenshot by Lester Mapp/ZDNET\n\nThat's the power of tools like Replit. Now, let's be clear, you're not going to build the next Facebook with this tool (at least not yet).\n\nWe're still in the early stages of this technology, but if this is what the early days look like, I can only imagine how much better it will get.\n\nThe good, the bad and the kinda ugly\n\n\ud83d\udc4dLet's start with the good:\n\nReplit is easy to use\n\nIt works well for Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\n\nThe AI-assisted coding is clever\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Now, the bad:\n\nIt's buggy at times\n\nIt's not very robust when dealing with complex user interface designs\n\nCustomer support is spotty\n\n\ud83e\udd74 And the ugly:\n\nI don't like that even when the software makes a mistake, you still use your credits. You tell the AI agent to fix the issue, it makes the same mistake again, and you lose more credits.\n\nYou know when ChatGPT gets stuck in a loop? It's like that, but the difference is you're paying for it. I'm not a fan of the pricing model, but I get it.\n\nAlso: There's a new king of online shopping, and it's built an unstoppable monopoly\n\nWhile my project was simple for the most part, I see how tools like this could get annoying for more complicated tasks.\n\nOverall, no-code tools like Replit are a great place to start, but they're not the end-all, if you get what I mean. I can also see this tool being more powerful if you know what you're doing.\n\nIf I had to describe it, I'd say it makes intermediate coders great, but it doesn't make newbie coders great. This process could be challenging for someone completely new, and patience is not included with the $25 plan.\ud83d\ude2c\n\nWhat should you build?\n\nThis is the tricky part. I don't want to tell you what to do, but I'll share this.\n\nFollowing your passion is excellent advice for a hobby, but not so much if you're trying to build a meaningful business.\n\nYou need to ask yourself what kind of lifestyle you want. The bigger your ambition, the more you'll need to put into it to see meaningful results.\n\nSo start there. Sit with yourself and be honest. What do you want?\n\nMy unsolicited advice? Find the intersection of a big problem and something you can stay committed to.\n\nAlso: I'm an AI tools expert, and these are the only two I pay for\n\nThe truth is, no matter what path you take, you will face challenges. You won't feel motivated some days, so discipline and commitment matter more than anything else.\n\nYou'd probably quit at the first challenge if I told you what to do. That's why you should take the time to sit with your thoughts before making a decision. \ud83e\udd14\n\nThat said, here are a few software companies Replit says were built using its tool.\n\nvia Lester Mapp Replit.com\n\nMagicSchool.ai - An innovative platform with over 60 AI-powered tools designed to enhance the educational experience for teachers and students.\n\nAutomateNow.xyz - A platform that helps businesses streamline their operations through automation.\n\nGetCubicle.com - A straightforward productivity tool designed to enhance focus and efficiency.

People can also opt to add a dry flush toilet and outdoor shower.\n\nWindows on every wall give you wonderful views, and fancy French doors make it stylish. Roof-mounted solar panels easily allow you to charge the tricycle and other appliances. With these amenities, it's perfect for a weekend in nature.\n\nBut the most impressive part of this micro-camper is the bike hauling it. Grounded collaborated with Civilized Cycles to pair the trailer with a bike that can go the distance. Civilized Cycles' Semi-Trike is bigger than your average tricycle. It acts like a tractor-trailer and has over 150 miles of range.\n\nBicycle camping trailers and e-bike campers are excellent electric alternatives to RVs. However, they don't offer the comfy space and freedom of the T1.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis micro-camper is one of many Grounded products that can revolutionize camping and nature outings. Traditional RVs, campers, and trailers require a lot of gas. They also require substantial maintenance.\n\nRather than break the bank at the gas station, people can save money and enjoy The Great Outdoors with the T1. The electric tricycle and easy-to-tow camper don't need any gas. They don't make loud engine sounds or leave a cloud of tailpipe pollution in your wake. You can enjoy a quiet, affordable journey while being kinder to the planet.\n\nIf you were going to purchase an EV, which of these factors would be most important to you?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nAccording to the Department of Energy, we use about 13 million barrels of oil daily to fuel personal vehicles. The average vehicle creates 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Harmful vehicle pollution is substantial, so Grounded's innovative alternatives can majorly help the environment.\n\nCamping is a delightful way to enjoy nature. But the journey to get there can hurt the very environment you want to admire. Grounded's T1 camper is on track to be available in spring 2025, helping travelers explore the world while caring for it.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "Share on X (formerly known as Twitter)\n\nIt\u2019s been a bumpy ride for the automotive industry for a few years now. Supply chain shortages alongside inflation that slowed consumer spending and raised production costs have plagued the industry. As it forges ahead, what are the automotive trends to watch in 2025?\n\nElectrification and autonomous vehicles will remain megatrends transforming the industry, forcing automakers, suppliers, and dealers to adapt to new technologies and ways of doing business. In order to remain competitive, industry players will have to move fast.\n\nWith established automakers facing nimble startups in the mobility race, building new business should be a priority for auto executives, according to McKinsey & Company. Data-driven connectivity services and on-demand mobility could add up to $1.5 trillion to the automotive revenue pool by 2030, they said.\n\n2025 automotive trends\n\nAs auto leaders plan for growth, they\u2019ll be leaning on artificial intelligence. AI is impacting every aspect of the industry, and everything inside and outside of the car.\n\nThe automotive AI software market is expected to reach around $200 billion by 2032.\n\nExamples inside the vehicle include advanced sensors to virtual assistants, intuitive interaction with in-car infotainment, vehicle safety, and the relationship between vehicles and the environment. Outside of the vehicle, examples include customers being able to visualize car configurations in seconds, tools for dynamic pricing, improved supply chain management, and more efficient production.\n\nStellantis and Mercedes-Benz have integrated ChatGPT to allow passengers to interact more naturally with their vehicles. These systems act as virtual travel companions, offering insights on destinations and local attractions.\n\nAI plays a big role in the automotive trends for 2025:\n\nAutonomous driving: The pace of driverless car development will accelerate as the industry counts on growing consumer confidence in autonomous driving. Electrification: Electric vehicles will gain more traction, boosted by growing consumer demand, supportive regulations, and advancements in battery technology. Connectivity + the rise of the software-defined vehicle: Connectivity is set to transform the driving experience by integrating vehicles into the IoT ecosystem, using data to enable a highly personalized journey. Changing customer preferences: Automakers will focus on the customer more than ever in order to deliver the right services and experiences by understanding the customer\u2019s perspective and their individual preferences. Resilient supply chain + smart manufacturing: The automotive industry is strengthening its supply chain by diversifying suppliers, adopting advanced technology, and prioritizing sustainable practices. Servitization: Automakers are exploring new revenue models beyond selling products. This servitization trend will grow in 2025, as companies for ways to sell everything as a service. Sustainability: With sustainable sourcing, EV production, and the focus on e-mobility, the automotive industry is taking steps to reduce its environmental impact. Smart cities: Smart cities are set to have a profound impact on the automotive industry, reshaping business models and consumer behavior.\n\n1. Autonomous driving trend speeds ahead\n\nDespite years of excitement around emerging technology for autonomous driving, the pace of developing driverless cars and deploying them has been slower than originally anticipated. Expect that to change in 2025.\n\nRecent advances in technology have sped things up. The market for autonomous cars is expected to balloon from $60.3 billion in 2025 to $449 billion by 2035, achieving a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.2% during this period.\n\nBut the automotive industry has some work to do in breaking down barriers to widespread acceptance, as the greater public has mixed feelings about the autonomous driving trend.\n\nA Pew Research study found that 44% of Americans view self-driving cars as a bad for society. However, those under 50 were more open to riding in an autonomous vehicle compared to those over 50 (47% vs. 25%).\n\nIn 2025, building customer confidence in the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles through demonstrations, transparency about the technology used, and increased safety will be essential for earning public acceptance and achieving growth. Projections suggest autonomous driving could save 3,200 lives and prevent 53,000 serious accidents by 2040.\n\n2. Automotive trends: E-vehicles race to the top\n\nThe electrification of vehicles aligns naturally with the rise of autonomous driving, thanks to shared technological compatibility, environmental benefits, and economic advantages. Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining traction as a viable alternative to traditional combustion-engine cars.\n\nThis shift towards e-mobility is driven by growing consumer demand, supportive regulations, and advancements in battery technology.\n\nDeloitte projects that by 2025, 18% to 36% of all vehicles sold will include alternative powertrains such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrids, or fuel cells.\n\nEVs could account for over 20 million in sales by 2025, representing as much as 23% of the global light-vehicle market and nearly 20% of total global vehicle sales, according to estimates. By contrast, sales of combustion engine vehicles are expected to sharply decline, potentially disappearing in major markets such as China, North America, and Germany by 2030.\n\nTo encourage EV uptake, governments are introducing subsidies and tax incentives, while automakers are teaming up with tech firms to achieve \u201cemissions-free\u201d technology and advance carbon-neutral mobility for a sustainable future.\n\nHowever, widespread EV adoption depends on overcoming infrastructure challenges, such as availability of charging stations. High prices are another barrier. Fortunately, advances in battery technology over the next few years are likely to reduce battery costs, making EVs more affordable and accessible.\n\nThis content is hosted by a third party ( vimeo.com ).

Connectivity and the rise of the software-defined vehicle\n\nConnectivity is set to transform the driving experience by integrating vehicles into the internet of things (IoT) ecosystem, using data to enable a highly personalized journey.\n\nImagine your car \u201cshopping\u201d for you, suggesting errands optimized by proximity, recommending a coffee stop when it senses your fatigue\u2014and even paying for it in advance! The connected vehicle trend aims to make every moment of your drive more efficient and enjoyable.\n\nThe software-defined vehicle (SDV) trend goes a step beyond connectivity, relying on software updates rather than hardware changes to maintain peak performance.\n\nTraditional vehicles require mechanical maintenance and can face recall delays due to parts shortages, with back-ordered components sometimes taking months to arrive. SDVs can be continuously improved, updated, and customized with over-the-air (OTA) updates, much like the software updates for smartphones or laptops. These updates deliver new features, performance enhancements, and bug fixes directly to the vehicle without any need for a visit to the shop.\n\nThe global connected car market is projected to grow significantly, from $56 billion in 2020 to $121 billion in 2025, according to Statista.\n\nExperts anticipate that over 400 million connected vehicles will be in use next year, fueled by partnerships between tech companies and automakers.\n\nFor example, automaker Stellantis teamed up with Amazon to develop its \u201csmart cockpit,\u201d an electronic platform set to be featured in vehicles across the company\u2019s 14 brands.\n\nIn essence, connectivity is poised to redefine how consumers interact with their vehicles and how automakers compete in the market.\n\n4. Automotive industry adapts to 2025 customer preferences\n\nThe growth of connected vehicles and personalized driving experiences means that automakers will focus on the customer more than ever. In order to deliver the right services and experiences, they need to understand the customer\u2019s perspective and their individual preferences.\n\nConnected vehicles provide real-time insights into customers, vehicles, and usage. In customer-facing processes, companies can apply digitization, automation, and AI to provide cohesive experiences across all sales channels.\n\nAutomakers are partnering with tech companies to develop smart features, integrating vehicles with IoT, and offering services such as remote updates, safety enhancements, and urban infrastructure connectivity.\n\nThis automotive customer-centric trend comes as consumer auto buying preferences continue to shift. Younger demographics, especially Gen Z, increasingly favor eco-friendly, tech-focused mobility options.\n\nA Cars.com survey found that 54% of Gen Zers would consider buying an EV compared to 41% of Gen Xers. Gen Zers cited long-term financial advantages and reduced environmental impact as reasons they might buy an EV.\n\n5. Resilient supply chain: 2025 automotive trend\n\nThe automotive industry is strengthening its supply chain by diversifying suppliers, adopting advanced technology, and prioritizing sustainable practices. This trend helps manufacturers avoid supply chain disruption so they can meet consumer demands reliably.\n\nTo reduce reliance on single sources, automakers are diversifying their supplier base. Integrating AI and IoT into the supply chain enables real-time monitoring and faster response to disruptions.\n\nNearly 42% of auto executives surveyed by SAP said improving or expanding supplier and partner networks is a top priority in their business growth plans.\n\nLast year, the carmaker Renault Group renewed its partnership with the prestigious \u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech in order to accelerate innovation in the supply chain using AI.\n\nSustainable sourcing is another trend, with renewable materials reducing risks. By adopting flexible, tech-forward, and sustainable practices, the automotive industry is building a robust supply chain capable of withstanding challenges, from natural disasters to global pandemics.\n\n6. Auto industry leans into servitization\n\nLike other manufacturers, automakers are exploring new revenue models beyond selling products. This servitization trend will grow in 2025, as companies find ways to sell everything as a service.\n\nThe global XaaS market is expected to grow to $3,221.96 billion by 2030, up from $699.79 billion in 2023.\n\nIn the automotive industry, business networks will be key for expanding into a services model. The network can provide bundled mobility services and subscriptions based on vehicle data. Examples include insurance packages, helping customers reduce their carbon footprint, and connecting them to maintenance services.\n\nServitization provides ongoing revenue while improving the driver experience and reducing environmental impact. Automakers can leverage it to support both vehicle ownership and alternatives like leasing and renting.\n\n7. Driving towards sustainability\n\nWith sustainable sourcing, EV production, and the focus on e-mobility, the automotive industry is taking steps to reduce its environmental impact, but has a long way to go: It\u2019s responsible for more than 10% of global carbon dioxide emissions, according to a World Economic Forum report.\n\nHowever, the industry is demonstrating a commitment to change with a relentless focus on increasing electric vehicle adoption and supply chain decarbonization, the report noted.\n\nCircular economy practices such as battery recycling and increased traceability also are helping to make auto supply chains more sustainable.\n\nIndustry collaboration plays a big role here. For example, Catena-X developed a uniform, secure data exchange system with multiple partners, including carmakers, suppliers, and others, to enable end-to-end traceability.\n\nAI innovations also increase efficient, eco-friendly mobility by optimizing vehicle routes, improving traffic flow, and guiding fuel-saving and emission-reducing driving practices.\n\n8. The smart cities effect\n\nSmart cities are set to have a profound impact on the automotive industry, reshaping business models and consumer behavior. Smart cities are urban areas designed to leverage technology, data, and connectivity to improve efficiency, sustainability, and residents\u2019 quality of life.\n\nIncreased connectivity will make vehicles part of the broader city infrastructure, enabling real-time data sharing to improve traffic flow and safety. For example, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Beijing were among the first cities to embrace driverless or robot taxis. These cars use the highest level of autonomy, relying on sensors and AI to detect their surroundings, read and analyze the information from the environment, then decide on an action and implement it.\n\nBy 2030, more than one in three kilometers driven could involve sharing concepts, and autonomous mobility could account for up to 40% of a smart city\u2019s overall traffic.\n\nSmart cities will influence everything from vehicle connectivity and urban mobility to operational strategies. As vehicle design, manufacturing, and urban planning evolve with smart city initiatives, automakers must keep up with this growing trend.\n\nThe road ahead for the auto industry\n\nWhile there are a lot of opportunities ahead for automakers and others in the industry, there will be plenty of challenges. Cost pressures, increased competition, and globalization will remain constant pressures on auto leaders as they look to remain competitive.\n\nThe growing trend of shared mobility also looms large as more people use shared transportation methods instead of owning cars. This will be a factor in slowing the growth rate of global auto sales from 3.6% in recent years to about 2% by 2030, according to McKinsey & Company.\n\nThe decline will be offset by shared vehicles that need more frequent replacement as well as growth in emerging markets like China, they said.\n\nAuto brands that stay on top of these trends and continue to innovate can build a resilient business as we head towards a more electrified, autonomous, connected, and sustainable future."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Why the Redmagic is unique A special button for a special mode Gaming on a big screen Where wired connection rules The Redmagic 9S Pro is oddly satisfying\n\nComparison is the thief of joy, it is widely claimed. As a \u201990s kid \u2014 and now a glum adult \u2014 I would like to contend that and swear that nothing eradicates joy from everyday existence faster than back pain. Therefore, the primary purpose of my existence is to eliminate inconveniences for my back, and so, my preferred mode of gaming is away from a stiff chair and in the warm embrace of a cushy couch where I can sit wrapped in a blanket.\n\nGaming consoles \u2014 or even a Windows laptop hooked to a wireless controller and to a TV or a large display \u2014 can fulfill that requirement. But when I wish to distract myself from the sullenness of working from home and not really engage in hardcore gaming, I find myself reaching out to my phone and not a gaming console. Sadly, though, the ease of gaming on a phone accompanies the immediate regret in the form of neck pain. Hence, with the turning of the year, I am placing my bets on a phone that doubles as a gaming console with the help of specialized tools to aid in connecting to a larger display \u2014 monitor, TV, or projector.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the Redmagic 9S Pro, a phone dedicated to gaming. Below, I will take you through all the ways the phone can be utilized for gaming on a large screen and explain why you would want to consider buying one, especially if you like casual gaming without much commitment. Before that, here\u2019s a brief introduction to the phone.\n\nWhy the Redmagic is unique\n\nThe Redmagic 9S Pro\u2019s unusual cyberpunk aesthetic already makes you believe it is a one-of-a-kind phone. No matter the angle you look at it, it unequivocally amazes you with its distinctive appearance. Despite the sharp edges and neat skin, the designs feel very refined.\n\nRedmagic has nailed some of the firsts as a phone company before gaming phones became a norm. It introduced capacitive trigger buttons to help you be better at gaming. Additionally, a high-speed fan is built inside the Redmagic 9S Pro\u2019s chassis to vent out any heat ejected from the chipset while gaming. The fan is automatically activated while running games or charging, so the phone never appears to heat up much.\n\nDriving the phone is an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, which is paired to 12GB of RAM on my unit. On top of that, a striking 6.8-inch AMOLED display with an under-display selfie camera and a nearly bezel-less outlook makes it one of the finest and most attractive pieces of mobile hardware from 2024.\n\nWith these features and specifications, the Redmagic 9S Pro is grossly underutilized by being limited to Android games. I say this because while Android phones \u2014 or phones, in general \u2014 have adopted key hardware components from PCs, the software has yet to match the same finesse as desktop environments. And while there are methods to force-fit mobile devices into PC setups, the endeavor requires efforts that not everyone is willing to make.\n\nThis is where the Redmagic 9S Pro comes into play, with its specialized modes to activate a gaming console-like environment without any special hackery. This is accomplished with a mix of software features and external controls that the phone offers.\n\nA special button for a special mode\n\nBesides the circular power button on the right side of the Redmagic 9S Pro lies a two-way slider switch with slopey accents and metallic red color. Flicking the switch upward activates a special mode on the phone called \u201cGame Space.\u201d When you turn on Game Space, the screen rotates horizontally as the phone enters a distinct interface.\n\nThe games installed on the Redmagic 9S Pro are listed in the \u201cGame Lobby\u201d as large tiles that can be stacked in a list or snapped to a grid. Tapping each tile or card shows when the game was installed and the total number of hours you have spent playing the specific game. The space also lets you access one-touch controls to toggle audio and fan on or off along with different controls to change the view of the interface.\n\nWith the red switch slotted upward, the phone is restricted to the game space, and you can\u2019t use it normally. But this interface is not where the Redmagic 9S Pro really stands out. The features, although less nuanced, can also be seen in the form of game modes for other devices.\n\nInstead, the 9S Pro offers a rather unique experience when you project the phone onto a bigger display.\n\nGaming on a big screen\n\nThis Redmagic gaming phone\u2019s true superpower lies in its desktop mode. While other phone brands emphasize a desktop environment for work \u2014 as Samsung does with its Linux-like DeX interface \u2014 the 9S Pro favor a gaming-oriented setup that appears particularly inspired by a console.\n\nThere are two ways to utilize this specialized mode: by connecting to a display either with a wired connection or wireless. In both methods, you can either directly cast the contents of the phone\u2019s screen onto a larger display or extend like you would with a computer or laptop, so you can continue interacting with your phone while also viewing the Game Space being cast to an external display.\n\nWith the wireless mode, you start by searching for a wireless display \u2014 one that supports Miracast or Chromecast \u2014 on the Redmagic 9S Pro.\n\nThe wireless casting functionality is native to Android, which means the phone\u2019s screen is simply duplicated on the larger display. A setup like that isn\u2019t exactly beneficial, especially while gaming, since you would need to look at the phone to ensure you are hitting the right buttons. So, Redmagic takes a different approach to remedy that issue.\n\nIn the extended screen mode, you see a display like the one seen below. The screen turns into a wireless touchpad that you can use to interact with the interface.\n\nNext, when you cast the phone wirelessly onto a bigger screen, the phone\u2019s screen can be turned into a large virtual gamepad. On the left of this gamepad, there\u2019s a direction pad and on the right, a set of ABXY buttons. Two joysticks for right and left are overlaid with these sets of buttons. This layout appears as an overlay on top of the actual game\u2019s interface.\n\nThe overlay can be hidden, so it\u2019s easier to navigate through the maze of convoluted menus on mobile games, and resurfaced when you are ready to dive into action. This is even useful for games that don\u2019t inherently support gamepads, as the keys can be remapped over existing buttons.\n\nThe overlay buttons are massive and fairly responsive, and I could get used to them with barely any practice or peeling my eyes away from the TV. With this setup, I thoroughly enjoyed games such as Call of Duty: Mobile, especially since I could continue using the capacitive triggers that I had mapped for shooting.\n\nWith the unfair, pleasantly unethical, advantage that a large 50-inch TV added for me, I scored some of the best kill-to-death ratios in deathmatches and constantly emerged as the MVP in the majority of the games. The bigger graphics and the brighter colors of the TV also make it much easier to scan for enemies across the landscape.\n\nAdding to the experience was the fact the Redmagic 9S Pro transmitted the visuals at up to 120 frames per second (fps) with low graphics and 60 fps with \u201cUltra\u201d video quality. Even though this is practically a mobile game upscaled to a massive display, the finer nuances are nearly undetectable from just a few feet away. More importantly, there is barely any latency on wireless connections even when my router sits in a different room.\n\nWhere wired connection rules\n\nWith wired connections \u2014 either through HDMI or DisplayPort, the Redmagic 9S Pro automatically connects in the most appropriate setting, and you don\u2019t need to manually toggle between duplicating the screen or extending it. With the red Game Space switch set to its off position, the screen is simply duplicated just as it is for any other phone that supports video out over its USB port. But when the switched is flicked on, the external display shows its console-like interface while the phone\u2019s display becomes a touchpad.\n\nThe cast display adjusts to the size and resolution of the second screen, eliminating any letterboxing or empty bars around the display.\n\nHowever, with the phone hooked to a display using a wire, using it to control the larger screen can feel cumbersome and jarring. Thankfully, there are a few ways around it. First, you can connect a keyboard and a mouse to operate the console-like ecosystem. Redmagic even gives you tools like key-mapping software that you can use to assign various keyboard and mouse buttons to each game separately. While it would be slightly easier if there were presets for games, you have to configure the control manually.\n\nNonetheless, you still get the advantage of using a keyboard and mouse for games that could benefit from the extra physical keys. More importantly, since the keyboard and mouse connected via this method are not detected in games like PUBG Mobile or Call of Duty: Mobile, you are not paired with other players using emulators or similar setups for first-person shooter gaming.\n\nTo overcome the limitations of ports, I use a . I relay an HDMI cable out of the hub and connect a wired mouse and keyboard through the USB ports. And to make sure I don\u2019t run out of power while gaming on a large screen, I connect a charger using the hub\u2019s USB-C port.\n\nI chose this hub over any other because it comes with a screen on top, which means I can see charging speeds and get a sense of the screen resolution via HDMI. Thanks to this tiny screen, I know the Redmagic 9S Pro projects to my 4K monitor at full 4K resolution at 60Hz.\n\nWhile getting higher refresh rates could be a challenge over HDMI 2.0 (since most USB hubs without Thunderbolt don\u2019t support HDMI 2.1 or newer standards), you can still use a USB-to-DisplayPort cable to relay contents at 4K resolution and up to 120Hz refresh rate. The onboard Snapdragon 8 Gen 3\u2019s GPU can handle the demand for this high-resolution output over the USB port. At the same time, the fan helps maintain a steadily convenient temperature inside the phone despite the load.\n\nA wired setup involving a mouse and keyboard is especially great if you like to game while sitting at a desk. But like I said at the beginning of the article, my objective this winter is to hole up in my sofa for as long as I can. So, I turned to a Bluetooth controller that lets me play games and control the phone\u2019s interface from a distance.\n\nFor this task, I picked up the , one of the most versatile gaming controllers. Although the extendable section is designed to keep the phone \u2014 or a Nintendo Switch \u2014 in between the two sides of the gamepad, Bluetooth connectivity means it works seamlessly even without a device tucked in those claws. Each of the grips features an individual vibration motor for rumble, and the trigger buttons have hall effect switches, similar to a PlayStation 5\u2019s controllers, for a precise level of pressing, which can be especially useful for controlling throttle in racing games.\n\nThe primary reason I chose this controller is that it can connect to a device in four different modes. In wireless connections, it can emulate a regular Android gamepad but can also replicate a PlayStation DualShock controller and Nintendo Switch\u2019s Joy-Cons. In wired mode, it can work as an Xbox controller. Based on the game I run \u2014 and whether it supports an Android gamepad or not \u2014 I can choose the mode to run.\n\nFor instance, since Call of Duty has native support for PS DualShock controllers, I was simply to slot the GameSir into the DS mode and use it native key mapping without any hackery. However, for games such as Mech Arena or Genshin Impact that do not support controllers (at least on Android), GameSir\u2019s app can also be used to map custom controls over practically any game.\n\nThe Redmagic 9S Pro, hooked to my 50-inch QLED TV and connected wirelessly to the GameSir controller, makes the ideal setup for me to enjoy a plethora of games without actually having to get up from my cozy spot.\n\nA similar setup can be achieved using a wireless connection, with two wireless devices in a signal chain \u2014 the controller and the wireless display. You might witness some latency, though, which may not be favorable for competitive games. But at the same time, having the phone handy also means you can control the interface almost immediately, especially if the controller you are using does not have a touchpad built in.\n\nI spent countless hours trying to nail the same level of dexterity on Call of Duty: Mobile as with the virtual joystick above, but jamming physical buttons and joysticks feels like a more satisfying experience than tapping a screen. It might be a different case with you, but the Redmagic 9S Pro\u2019s flexibility allows plenty of room for adjustment for all measures.\n\nBesides Call of Duty, I extensively played Shadow Fight 4 (comparable to Street Fighter), especially since it offers native controller support. Similarly, Farlight 84, a lighthearted battle royale that looks like Fortnite and Apex Legends had a baby, is another title I thoroughly enjoyed thanks to this setup.\n\nBut that\u2019s not where I settled. Of course, Android allows all sorts of emulation tools to run classic Nintendo, PlayStation, PSP, or even older Windows games. So I installed Dolphin Emulator, PPSSPP Emulator, and Winlator, snagged a few free ROMs off the internet, and ran a bunch of my favorite games from my childhood and teenage years, such as Need For Speed: Most Wanted, successfully rotting on my couch for the entirety of the Christmas break.\n\nAll this happened while I barely experienced any glitches in the gameplay with these emulators and got stable frame rates, thanks to the constantly running fan at the back. Redmagic also allows connecting to a laptop or Windows PC and running Android games while you utilize the connected peripherals, but that\u2019s not the utility I\u2019m going after.\n\nThe Redmagic 9S Pro is oddly satisfying\n\nOver the time I have spent with the Redmagic 9S Pro, I have had an unwavering opinion that there is no phone like it. Perhaps the ones that are are from the same brand. After a slight learning curve, I thoroughly enjoyed gaming on the Redmagic 9S Pro and especially cherished times when I spent playing games on the larger display. If you tap into the world of emulators, there\u2019s hardly a chance you will emerge from it without spending a few days just wheeling in nostalgia.\n\nEven without the casting features, the Redmagic 9S Pro is commendable as a gaming phone. Besides a souped-up flagship Snapdragon processor, the dedicated cooling fan and the trigger button give you such an advantage over competitors. Meanwhile, the RGB lighting sets the right mood for gaming.\n\nMost importantly, for the hardware it brings, the 9S Pro has an unbeatable price. For , you get the unlocked version that also includes an 80W fast charger. If you were to spend $250 more, you could get a newer generation of gaming phone from Redmagic with a Snapdragon 8 Elite instead and 16GB of RAM, though that might be overkill. The 9S Pro, on the other hand, brings unmatched value and can be just as good as a primary phone as it will be as a secondary phone specifically for gaming \u2014 all depending on your budget. Either way, you will be blown away."

Deployments like these demand careful consideration of critical aspects such as latency, cost, throughput, and governance. Another important factor is the choice of deployment destination\u2014whether to opt for cloud-based or on-premise deployment. This decision often shapes the way I approach an ML problem. A key takeaway from my work has been that ML projects almost always revolve around data. Data is the center of gravity, and it significantly influences where a project begins\u2014whether that\u2019s in a cloud-native tool like Amazon SageMaker or a GPU-enabled local compute cluster.\n\nExplainability and responsible AI are essential pillars for any production-level AI deployment. These systems, which are responsible for key production decisions, must operate with transparency and accountability. Cloud-based deployments often excel in these areas, providing scalability and governance that support these principles. Once an ML model is deployed, I ensure regular communication with stakeholders to maintain alignment and proactively address any concerns. This approach not only keeps everyone on the same page but also fosters trust and collaboration throughout the deployment process.\n\nQ2: Can you tell me a little bit about Observable and Responsible AI and why it\u2019s important?\n\nA: Observable AI ensures that AI systems can be monitored in real time for performance, reliability, and anomalies. By leveraging tools like dashboards and automated alerts, organizations can quickly identify and address issues such as latency spikes or model drift. For example, in e-commerce, observability helps detect and resolve delays in recommendation engines during high-traffic events like Black Friday sales, ensuring a seamless customer experience.\n\nResponsible AI focuses on designing systems that are ethical, transparent, and free from bias, particularly in critical domains like hiring, healthcare, or finance. By prioritizing fairness and explainability, organizations can ensure their AI systems make decisions that align with societal values. Together, observable and responsible AI build trust by ensuring operational reliability and ethical accountability, forming the foundation for sustainable AI adoption.\n\nQ3: Can you explain how your approach changes with different data types like Audio or Images or even Videos?\n\nA: My approach evolves based on the data type\u2014whether it\u2019s audio, images, or video. Audio data requires focused preprocessing, such as noise reduction and feature extraction, often transforming signals into spectrograms or embeddings. Latency and real-time performance are critical in deploying applications like voice assistants or speech recognition systems.\n\nFor images, preprocessing techniques like data augmentation and normalization ensure robustness. Tasks like classification or segmentation often use deep learning models, such as CNNs or vision transformers. Deployment considerations focus on scalability and inference speed, especially when handling large datasets or real-time needs.\n\nVideo data adds temporal complexity, requiring specialized architectures like transformers or spatiotemporal models. Preprocessing involves extracting frames and features while addressing storage and computational demands. Across all data types, I balance accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, ensuring explainability and responsible AI principles remain integral to every deployment.\n\nQ4: What\u2019s your take on MLOps and the value it adds to improving ML end to end efficiency?\n\nA: MLOps plays a pivotal role in streamlining the end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning, from model development to deployment and monitoring.

It empowers systems to create realistic and contextually accurate outputs, such as synthetic data for training models, personalized content, or automated decision support. Additionally, generative AI simplifies coding by generating boilerplate code, providing suggestions, and breaking down complex implementation concepts into actionable steps\u2014much like how a drill bit simplifies mechanical tasks. By leveraging models like transformers and diffusion models, I integrate generative AI into workflows for tasks like content generation, anomaly detection, and multimodal understanding. This approach not only enhances the efficiency and accuracy of solutions but also opens doors to solving problems that traditional AI methods struggle to address, such as creating human-like interactions or scaling creative processes in real-time applications.\n\nQ9: How do you manage technical debt in AI systems?\n\nA: Managing technical debt in AI systems requires a proactive and structured approach to ensure scalability, maintainability, and long-term efficiency. I prioritize clear documentation, modular architecture, and robust testing frameworks to reduce complexity and facilitate easier updates. Regular code reviews and refactoring sessions help identify and resolve inefficiencies or outdated practices before they compound.\n\nIn addition, I emphasize the importance of monitoring and retraining models to address issues like data drift or outdated assumptions, which can quickly lead to technical debt in AI systems. Leveraging automation tools for CI/CD pipelines and version control ensures that changes are seamlessly integrated and tracked, reducing manual effort and mitigating risks.\n\nQ10: How do you see AI/ML infrastructure evolving?\n\nA: AI infrastructure is evolving towards more sophisticated and automated solutions. The adoption of serverless computing will enhance deployment capabilities. Implementation of edge computing will reduce traditional limitations. Focus on sustainability will increase resource efficiency. Security considerations will become increasingly important. Integration with emerging technologies will streamline AI operations. Continuous learning will remain essential for innovation.\n\nAbout Pranav Murthy\n\nPranav Murthy is a distinguished AI/ML leader with extensive experience in research and practical applications.

            "article_content": "2024\u2019s anime fall season had some big new arrivals in the medium such as Dandadan and Dragon Ball Daima, introducing some wild new stories and battles on the small screen. One of the biggest comebacks of the previous season was most assuredly Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War, which presented its third batch of episodes pitting the Shinigami against the Wandenreich. Following the recent season finale from Studio Pierrot, the production house wasted little time in confirming the shonen anime\u2019s conclusion, and a recent interview from two of the biggest anime voice actors hints at what is to come.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nOne of the biggest conflicts of the Thousand-Year Blood War is Uryu Ishida and his former friends in the Soul Society. Thanks to Ishida\u2019s status as a Quincy, he apparently found himself throwing in his lot with Yhwach and nearly eliminating his past allies to help progress his bloodline\u2019s goals. Voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama, Ishida has had plenty of wild moments in the Bleach revival and the same can definitely be said for Ichigo Kurosaki\u2019s voice actor Masakazu Morita. Speaking with the anime\u2019s official website, both actors had quite a bit to say regarding the series finale that has yet to reveal its release date.\n\nPierrot\n\n[RELATED: Bleach Announces Thousand-Year Blood War Part 4]\n\nIchigo Talks The Grand Blood War Finale\n\nTo start, Masakazu Morita teased the upcoming quality of the Blood War\u2019s animation, \u201cNot only is the quality of the visuals high, but the battles themselves are also high-level, and in the process, I think it was a season in which the \u201cfeelings\u201d of each character were unraveled. On the other hand, those who watched the third season to the end may still have some vague feelings, such as the \u201cconflict\u201d throughout the third season, the conflict between others and themselves, and the conflict within themselves that cannot be resolved. However, I think that will turn into a sense of exhilaration when you finish watching the fourth season, which is the true final chapter.\u201d\n\nIn a surprise twist, Morita also hinted at the season ending in a way that some anime fans might not expect, \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think it will end with just exhilaration\u2026 (laughs). Anyway, I hope that vague feeling will become the energy to reach the final conclusion. The third season of the four-part series of the \u201cThousand-Year Blood War Arc\u201d series has ended, but I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s over at all, and I think it\u2019s just beginning. I hope you will look forward to the fourth season and the future of \u201cBLEACH.\u201d\n\nWill Ishida Remain a Traitor?\n\nOn the flip side, Ishida\u2019s voice actor, Noriaki Sugiyama, teased that the final season is one that will not disappoint, \u201cAs you may know, \u201cThe Conflict\u201d was a season that was packed with a lot of settings and episodes under the supervision of Kubo-sensei. Meanwhile, the reason why Uryuu joined the Quincy side was finally revealed, and the story ended at a turning point. As a reader of Bleach, I am looking forward to seeing how many episodes the production team and the sensei have worked out in the fourth season. Also, when the scenes depicted in the original manga were animated, I think there were many new things that could be felt when they were made into video, such as \u201cI didn\u2019t know the world would expand so much\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t know how the movements would look in video\u201d. The same goes for the fourth season, and there is no doubt that it will be a series that will not disappoint everyone, so I hope you will look forward to the same superb quality as before.\u201d\n\nVia Bleach Official Website"

            "article_content": "A top M&A banker said Big Pharma will be on the hunt for more acquisitions in 2025.\n\nMajor drugs including Keytruda and Eliquis will see patent exclusivity expire in coming years.\n\nPharma companies look at areas such as obesity to supplement growth, Jefferies' Chris Roop said.\n\nBig Pharma will hunt for more acquisitions in 2025 as industry giants face patent expiration for some of their best-selling drugs, according to a top M&A banker.\n\nAD\n\nMerck's cancer drug Keytruda, the top-selling medication in the world, will lose patent exclusivity at the end of 2028.\n\nEliquis, made by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb to treat and prevent blood clots, will lose its exclusivity earlier that same year. The two drugs raked in $25 billion and $12 billion, respectively, for their manufacturers in 2023.\n\nAD\n\nWhen patents expire, pharma company revenue can take a hit as rivals create similar offerings to take market share. Developing brand new drugs is a long, expensive, and risky process, so acquisitions of other companies with new medications in their pipelines offer a potentially faster way to generate new revenue.\n\nThis is partly why Chris Roop, head of M&A for the Americas at Jefferies, is expecting biopharma M&A to pick up in 2025.\n\n\"The gaps to fill are significant when you think about replacing drugs that achieve peak sales north of $20 billion or $30 billion drug before patent exclusivity expires,\" Roop told Business Insider in a recent interview.\n\nAD\n\nLarge, successful pharmaceutical companies can become victims of their own successes when patents run out on blockbuster treatments, he added.\n\nAbbVie's popular arthritis drug Humira saw its patent exclusivity expire in 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, with patients increasingly turning to similar drugs or other prescriptions, AbbVie saw its revenue from global sales of Humira fall 37% from the previous year's quarter.\n\nTo make up for looming revenue gaps, Roop said Big Pharma will increasingly turn to M&A next year, buying smaller biotechs developing drugs in major markets such as obesity and oncology.\n\nAD\n\n2025's top drug targets\n\nObesity is positioned to be biopharma's hottest market in 2025, Roop predicted.\n\nRelated stories\n\n2024's biggest pharma acquisition was in obesity. Novo Nordisk's controlling shareholder Novo Holdings closed a deal in December to buy development and manufacturing company Catalent for $16.5 billion. The deal gives Novo Nordisk more manufacturing power for its obesity drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which makes Mounjaro and Zepbound, have a significant headstart in the exploding field of GLP-1 weight-loss treatments. Originally created to treat diabetes, injectable GLP-1 medications have surged in popularity. In May, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that one in eight US adults had tried a GLP-1 drug.\n\nAD\n\nMany other pharma companies want a piece of that pie, Roop said.\n\n\"Obesity is going to be a $100 billion to $150 billion market, so even if you come up with a third or fourth entrant in that market and only achieve 2% to 4% share, you still have a multibillion-dollar drug on your hands,\" he explained.\n\nBeyond obesity, Roop sees immunology and inflammation drugs as big targets for biopharma M&A next year. That market saw a few large deals in 2024, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals' $4.9 billion purchase of Alpine Immune Sciences, which has a drug in development that targets Berger's disease, an autoimmune kidney condition.\n\nAD\n\nChris Roop, head of M&A for the Americas at investment bank Jefferies, said Big Pharma will be looking for acquisitions in areas like obesity and immunology next year. Jefferies\n\nRoop expects oncology to remain a focus area for Big Pharma next year.\n\nHe said pharmaceutical companies are especially interested in precision oncology M&A, including drugs targeting more specific cancers and even new methods of personalizing cancer treatment.\n\nAstraZeneca made a precision oncology acquisition in March with its $2.4 billion purchase of Fusion Pharmaceuticals, which is developing a radiopharmaceutical drug, which uses radioactive isotopes to treat midstage prostate cancer.\n\nAD\n\nFinally, Roop said Big Pharma will continue looking to buy companies with cardiovascular drugs in their pipelines. Heart disease and related conditions remain the leading cause of death. The global market for cardiovascular drugs was valued at about $150 billion in 2024, according to Precedence Research.\n\nNovo Nordisk bought Cardior Pharmaceuticals in March in a deal worth up to $1.1 billion to strengthen its cardiovascular drug pipeline.\n\nRoop said both private and public biopharma companies could be acquisition targets next year.\n\nAD\n\n\"A lot of what we're doing is trying to find that equilibrium to fund these companies to a point in time where pharma will say \u2014 on that data with that amount of patients and with a drug profile like this \u2014 I'm willing to take the risk, buy it from that point, and take it forward into late-stage development,\" he said.\n\n\"There are a lot of private and public companies that are in that lane today. We probably have more privates today with advanced data than we did three or four years ago,\" he added.\n\nRoop said many of these private biopharma companies with advanced data are also well-positioned to potentially go public as the IPO window reopens."

            "article_content": "Ever since Microsoft first introduced its Arm-based Copilot Plus laptops in June, I\u2019ve been wondering when we might see Copilot Plus features appear on desktop PCs. Six months on, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re about to see mini PCs that deliver the AI performance required for features like Recall, Click To Do, and AI-powered image generation and editing in Windows 11. These mini PCs might even help Microsoft compete with Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nAsus became the first PC manufacturer to announce a mini PC that\u2019s Copilot Plus capable in September. It then revealed the full specs of its upcoming NUC 14 Pro AI last month, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that kicks off next week. Asus\u2019 mini PC even has a Copilot button on the front and is almost identical to the size of Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nThe timing of Asus\u2019 spec drop came on the same day that Taiwanese company Geekom revealed three new mini PCs that it will showcase at CES. Geekom is releasing a mini PC with AMD\u2019s Strix Point CPUs inside and one with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processor, meaning both will be Copilot Plus compatible. The third model is powered by Intel\u2019s unannounced Arrow Lake-H laptop processors, which are unlikely to have an NPU sufficient enough to be Copilot Plus compatible.\n\nI\u2019m going to be paying close attention to CES next week to see if there are any other Windows OEMs that are ready to launch Copilot Plus mini PCs. CES is usually a launch point for Microsoft\u2019s latest laptop or tablet initiatives, and last year the company convinced OEMs to put a Copilot key on their laptop keyboards. Asus wouldn\u2019t be adding a Copilot button on the front of its own mini PC without Microsoft\u2019s involvement, so I wonder how many other PC makers Microsoft has been working with to add dedicated Copilot buttons.\n\nGeekom\u2019s mention of Qualcomm chips inside its mini PC means we\u2019ll start to see Qualcomm\u2019s latest chips venture beyond laptops for the first time. Qualcomm was supposed to ship its mini PC Snapdragon Dev Kit in June alongside Copilot Plus laptops, but it ended up canceling it months later after issues with manufacturing the device. Qualcomm has also teased that its Snapdragon X Elite chips could appear in mini PCs or even all-in-one PCs, so perhaps we\u2019ll see some Copilot Plus all-in-one PCs next week, too.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see when we might get Copilot Plus features on traditional powerful desktop PCs. Intel\u2019s latest Core Ultra desktop CPU arrived in October with an NPU inside, but it wasn\u2019t capable enough to hit the 40 TOPS requirement that Microsoft mandates for Copilot Plus features. We\u2019re going to have to wait until next-gen desktop CPUs from Intel and AMD arrive to see if more capable NPUs are a priority for chipmakers. Until then, mini PCs and all-in-one PCs that use laptop processors are going to be the only way to get Copilot Plus features in a desktop PC form factor.\n\nWhile Copilot Plus features remain limited to Windows PCs, that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t see the main Copilot assistant appear on more devices. I\u2019ve heard from multiple sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans that the company is keen to get Copilot on devices beyond just PCs, phones, and tablets.\n\nWe might well see Copilot appear on some unexpected hardware at CES next week, just as Microsoft has also been hinting about its ambitions for dedicated AI hardware in recent months. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri admitted in an October Notepad interview that the power of modern AI models \u201cwill free up the ability to innovate in hardware and come out with purpose-built hardware.\u201d\n\nDavuluri stopped short of detailing what dedicated AI hardware would look like for Microsoft, but weeks later Yusuf Mehdi, executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft, dropped some additional hints in an underreported interview with YouTuber Austin Evans.\n\n\u201cThese devices that see the world, that you wear on your body, on your person, I think that those combined with AI will be very valuable,\u201d said Mehdi in late October. \u201cIt can do image recognition, it can talk to you about what\u2019s going on. I think that\u2019s a fascinating place that we\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview Mehdi also describes wearable health-related devices as exciting and \u201ca big opportunity\u201d for the future. Microsoft then confirmed last month that Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has hired multiple former colleagues to help run a new AI health unit. It\u2019s hard to imagine Microsoft venturing into fitness wearables again after the Microsoft Band was scrapped in 2016, but I could definitely see the company wanting to partner with device manufacturers and offer up AI-powered health services for these types of devices.\n\nEither way, 2025 won\u2019t see Microsoft slow down with its ambition to get Copilot on all the screens we look at every day.\n\nThe pad:\n\nThanks for subscribing and reading to the very end. I\u2019ll be reflecting on Microsoft\u2019s 50-year history in Notepad later this year, so if there\u2019s a particular period of time you\u2019re interested in hearing more about,please get in touch: notepad@theverge.com."

The computational demands of running generative AI models make traditional cloud deployments look like a kid\u2019s lemonade stand.

The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it?

            "source": "Popular Mechanics",
            "article_content": "Since November 13, New Jersey has been in the midst of a genuine drone panic. It began as a handful of sightings outside military bases like the U.S. Army\u2019s Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, a research and manufacturing site that was once the site of bomb-making during World War II. That has since exploded to over 5,000 sightings reported to the FBI across not only New Jersey but at least ten other states.\n\nReports of car-sized drones, blinking lights, and mysterious objects zipping through the skies have caused widespread hysteria to the point that, in December, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy urged the public to \u201ccalm down,\u201d assuring residents that \u201csophisticated federal investigators\u201d are now involved.\n\nThe FBI says the drones pose no risk to civilians, and of the thousands of sightings, sightings, the Bureau only felt 100 reports were worth following up on, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said during a December 16 press briefing. Still, as of January 2, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued 57 drone flight restrictions over New Jersey, largely over critical infrastructure.\n\nWhile the government lacks concrete explanations for the sightings, there are many theories about the current drone \u201cflap\u201d to borrow a term from the UFO world that describes a rash of flying saucer sightings. Scientists, skeptics, aircraft pilots, experienced drone operators, and conspiracy theorists have all proposed their own beliefs\u2014some mundane, some fantastical. Many of the hunches are almost certainly correct, such as airplanes being misidentified as drones or classified government activity taking place. But other ideas, including alien \u201cmotherships\u201d flying over the ocean or a drone version of the \u201cchemtrail\u201d conspiracy theory, seem less likely.\n\nConfronted with mysteries, people tend to see what they want to see, overlaying their own belief systems on the unknown in an attempt to make sense of it. In psychology, this is known as confirmation bias, and it\u2019s a very human response\u2014but that doesn\u2019t make our assumptions correct. So, we rounded up the nine most popular theories about the New Jersey drone frenzy, ranked from most to least likely.\n\nPeople are noticing drones that have always been around.\n\nDrones have been around for about a decade, and many drones are used for policing, surveying, and search and rescue. It is quite likely that many of the reported drone sightings are just that: drones that have been zipping around for years, doing completely ordinary drone things, and people are just now noticing them.\n\n\u201cThere are more than 1 million drones that are lawfully registered with the Federal Aviation Administration here in the United States,\u201d Kirby said during last month\u2019s White House press briefing on the rash of drone sightings. \u201cAnd there are thousands of commercial, hobbyist and law enforcement drones that are lawfully in the sky on any given day. That is the ecosystem that we are dealing with.\u201d\n\nNatural and human-made phenomena are being misidentified as drones.\n\nLike UFO sightings throughout their history, people with no observation training are reporting ordinary objects in the night sky as drones. Civil aviation pilots have reported an uptick in lasers pointed at their aircraft since the wave of sightings began, the result of people misidentifying harmless planes as drones. (It\u2019s worth pointing out that aiming a laser at an airplane is a federal crime .)\n\nA well-known phenomenon responsible for UFO sightings is that planes flying directly toward or away from an observer often appear to be \u201chovering\u201d in place. In a particularly embarrassing example, former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan posted to X a video of what he claimed were drones, but the constellation Orion. A similar sighting posted to social media was .\n\nThe wave is being exacerbated by real drone operators pranking the public.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to anonymously fly a hobbyist drone. One possibility is that some of the drone sightings are the result of drone operators that are deliberately stirring the pot with their own drones. This, however, would be risky, as operators must be FAA-certified, and violating regulations can land you a $75,000 fine and a revoked certification .\n\nThe drones are being flown by spies from hostile countries with nefarious intent.\n\nAnother theory is that agents from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran are flying the drones. Spies could be attempting to use drones to record classified Pentagon activity or rehearse attacks on American soil. One New Jersey congressman has claimed , without proof, that the drones are coming from an \u201cIranian drone mothership\u201d anchored in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOn one hand, there have indeed been sightings of drones around sensitive military sites, , an Air Force facility currently working on the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. Additionally, a Chinese national was arrested in December for flying a drone over Vandenberg Space Force Base. On the other hand, there is no firm proof linking any of these events to hostile foreign governments, and the Pentagon denies that an \u201cIranian mothership\u201d even exists.\n\nThe drones are being flown by terrorists.\n\nA similar theory is that the drones are being flown by terrorist groups, either foreign or domestic, gathering intelligence or rehearsing an attack. The United States has no shortage of foreign terrorist adversaries that operate drones, including Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, or Houthi rebels. But all of those groups are currently preoccupied in the Middle East\u2014especially those fighting Israel, a much closer enemy\u2014or are clawing for local control in Syria. Domestic, home-grown terrorism is another possibility, especially with the current wave of political violence that included at least two assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe drones are owned by the government and are searching for lost radioactive material.\n\nOne conspiracy theory claims that the drones, outfitted with neutron detectors and other specialized equipment capable of detecting nuclear material, are searching for lost radioactive medical equipment . There is an element of truth to the theory: the Department of Energy\u2019s Nuclear Emergency Search Team, or NEST for short, is trained to search for lost, potentially dangerous radioactive material; homemade or stolen nuclear weapons; and \u201cdirty\u201d bombs. NEST does indeed have specialized vehicles, including trucks and helicopters, to detect such materials. But, according to ABC News , the \u201clost\u201d medical equipment was never lost. Furthermore, the Department of Energy denies it uses drones to detect radioactivity.\n\nThe drones are spraying chemicals.\n\nOther conspiracy theorists, including Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, are advancing the theory that whoever is operating the drones is spraying chemicals over population centers for unknown purposes. No chemical spray has been associated with the drones so far, and Greene\u2014a well-known advocate of far-fetched ideas once who suggested that Jewish space lasers were intentionally starting forest fires \u2014has not provided any proof. Another ding against the conspiracy is that drones have a limited range and payload, making them poor spreaders of chemicals.\n\nThe drones are part of an effort to enslave mankind and create a one-world dictatorship.\n\nIn the 1990s, Canadian journalist Serge Monast advanced the bizarre theory that NASA and the United Nations were planning to stage worldwide events that would cause mankind to reject Christianity and democracy in favor of a dictatorship headed by the Antichrist. The conspiracy, known as Project Blue Beam , would use holograms and drones to impersonate UFOs and angels. Needless to say, no evidence for this theory exists, and the idea that the drones are \u201c biblically accurate angels \u201d is pretty far down the list of rational explanations.\n\nThe drones are actually alien spaceships.\n\nTying Project Blue Beam for unlikely theories is the idea that the drones are actually misidentified alien spaceships.

Others deemed the video a fake, and a cluster still holds steadfast that it was alien activity, the Daily Mail said.\n\nThe Falcon 9 rocket has a \u201creusable first stage booster\u201d that ultimately fell back to the planet just eight and a half minutes after it left the ground. It was caught in the Atlantic Ocean on a drone ship.\n\nStitch, on the other hand, will return to theaters worldwide May 23, 2025, in a live-action version of the 2002 animated film of the same name.

In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

            "article_content": "Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity has revolutionized our understanding of gravity and the universe. However, it leaves some unanswered questions, particularly about singularities and black holes.\n\nRecent studies suggest quantum mechanics could help resolve these mysteries and offer new insights into the fundamental nature of space-time and black holes.\n\nGeneral relativity\n\nGeneral relativity is a theory developed by Albert Einstein to explain how gravity works.\n\nInstead of thinking of gravity as a force that pulls objects toward each other, like Isaac Newton suggested, Einstein proposed that gravity is the result of massive objects bending the space and time around them.\n\nImagine space and time as a stretchy fabric, and when something heavy, like the Earth or the Sun, sits on it, the fabric bends around it.\n\nThis bending is what we experience as gravity. So, objects like planets and moons move in curved paths because they are following the curves in this \u201cfabric\u201d created by mass.\n\nOne of the most mind-blowing predictions of general relativity is that time isn\u2019t the same everywhere.\n\nTime actually moves slower near a strong gravitational field, like near a planet or a star, and faster in areas with weaker gravity.\n\nThis effect is known as time dilation. It\u2019s something that satellites in space have to account for because they experience time a little differently than we do on Earth.\n\nUnderstanding singularities \u2013 the basics\n\nThe elegant framework of general relativity encounters a critical limitation at singularities \u2013 points in space-time where matter collapses to infinite density, and the curvature of space-time becomes infinitely sharp.\n\nThese singularities arise under extreme gravitational collapse, as shown by Nobel laureate Roger Penrose. When a massive star exhausts its fuel and collapses under its gravity, the result can be a singularity.\n\nAt a singularity, the fundamental laws of physics, as we know them, no longer work. Concepts like time, space, and the behavior of matter lose their meaning, rendering physical predictions impossible.\n\nThis unpredictability would challenge science\u2019s foundation, which relies on consistent, testable laws to explain the universe.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing singularities is, therefore, a major challenge in modern physics.\n\nResearchers aim to find ways to reconcile this breakdown, often looking to quantum mechanics or other advanced theories to fill the gaps left by general relativity.\n\nBlack holes and cosmic censorship\n\nBlack holes, nature\u2019s enigmatic phenomena, may conceal singularities. Their defining feature, the event horizon, prevents anything, including light, from escaping.\n\nAccording to Penrose\u2019s cosmic censorship conjecture, singularities resulting from gravitational collapse remain hidden behind these event horizons, preserving the predictability of physics elsewhere in the universe.\n\nDespite its elegance, cosmic censorship remains unproven. Scientists have found no definitive counterexamples, making it one of the most significant open problems in mathematical physics.\n\nQuantum mechanics and black holes\n\nWhile general relativity focuses on large-scale structures, quantum mechanics governs particles and atoms.\n\nCombining these frameworks to understand black holes has proven complex. Recent research published in the journal Physical Review Letters suggests that Penrose\u2019s conjecture is supported by quantum mechanics.\n\nPhysicists have long speculated about \u201cquantum black holes,\u201d where quantum effects play a significant role. These black holes raise questions about how cosmic censorship applies in the quantum realm.\n\nA potential answer lies in developing a theory of \u201cquantum gravity,\u201d which integrates quantum mechanics with space-time. However, such a theory remains elusive.\n\nAdvances in quantum cosmic censorship\n\nQuantum mechanics introduces new complexities such as negative energy, a phenomenon allowed in quantum mechanics but absent in classical physics.\n\nPenrose\u2019s theorem assumes that all matter has positive energy, so the existence of negative energy introduces scenarios that the theorem does not address.\n\nTo explore these complexities, researchers use a hybrid approach called semi-classical gravity. In this model, the space-time structure still obeys Einstein\u2019s general relativity, but the matter within it is treated according to quantum mechanics.\n\nThis allows scientists to study how quantum effects influence the behavior of space-time and black holes.\n\nFrom this perspective, quantum mechanics might play a role in keeping singularities hidden. The concept, called quantum cosmic censorship, proposes that quantum effects could reinforce the \u201cclothing\u201d of singularities by black hole event horizons.\n\nThis means that quantum mechanics may prevent singularities from becoming observable, thus modifying their behavior and preserving the predictability of the universe.\n\nThe idea builds on Penrose\u2019s original cosmic censorship conjecture but extends it into the quantum realm, offering a potential bridge between classical and quantum physics.\n\nThe energy of space-time\n\nA key to understanding quantum cosmic censorship lies in the Penrose inequality. This mathematical relationship links the mass of space-time to the area of black hole horizons, assuming cosmic censorship holds. In quantum systems, a similar inequality could provide insights.\n\nIn 2019, researchers proposed a quantum Penrose inequality. Building on this, the new study introduced a refined version that applies even in strong quantum effects.\n\nThe research shows that the energy of space-time relates to the combined entropy of black holes and quantum matter, which thus maintains the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nStrengthening theories with quantum mechanics\n\nThe new quantum Penrose inequality strengthens the idea of cosmic censorship. While not a definitive proof, it shows that quantum mechanics reinforces the principles governing black holes and singularities.\n\nThis advance bridges classical and quantum physics, and paves the way for deeper insights into the universe.\n\nAs space-time might end at singularities, quantum mechanics ensures we remain shielded from such extremes, preserving the predictability of our universe.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?
