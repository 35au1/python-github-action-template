        "article_content": "King Charles is known as a man of discerning tastes and strong opinions. He has a long-held interest in alternative beliefs and mystical therapies, and we all know his thoughts on leaky pens.\n\nBut who would have thought His Majesty may also have been a close associate of visitors from another planet and was once spotted at the controls of a UFO?\n\nThat is the bizarre claim being made in a new TV documentary which examines the royals' interest in UFOs and other paranormal mysteries.\n\nKing Of UFOs, made by British musician and UFO buff Mark Christopher Lee and now available on Amazon Prime, asks the question: does the Royal Family know what's really out there?\n\nIn it, he speaks to a diver, Dan Costello, who says he witnessed Charles, then Prince of Wales, at the controls of 'a saucer-shaped craft with dual rotor blades' at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1975.\n\nKing Charles may have been a close associate of visitors from another planet and was once spotted at the controls of a UFO\n\nThe then dashing 27-year-old prince was one of three pilots spotted steering the 'odd-looking' object, while serving as a qualified helicopter pilot with the Royal Navy, he claims.\n\nDescribing the aircraft, he says: 'It would sit and hover in the sky with the blades not on [rotating] with no sound of propulsion, just a faint crackle of electromagnetism.'\n\nWhile, sadly, Costello goes on to admit that the aircraft Charles was allegedly flying was most probably not of alien origin, but part of a secret military operation, involving the British and Canadian governments \u2013 plus it hasn't been confirmed that Charles was anywhere near Canada at the time \u2013 it does bring into focus a royal fascination with all things 'other worldly', that goes back generations.\n\nIndeed, as I can exclusively reveal, the King may well have inherited a keen interest in the subject from his late father, Prince Philip, and his great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, both of whom were avid enthusiasts.\n\nPhilip had a lifelong interest and curiosity in a range of fringe subjects, including UFOs, crop circles and the Loch Ness monster.\n\nMountbatten's fascination, meanwhile, reached its zenith between 1950 and 1959, shortly before his appointment as Chief of Defence Staff, the highest position in the British military. And it prompts Lee, in the documentary, to ask of our new King: 'Does he know the truth? If so, he should release this truth to the public.'\n\nAs an investigative journalist, university lecturer and committed ufologist, I first heard of the active role the royals had played in seeking the answer to the ultimate question \u2013 Are we alone? \u2013 as part of my research back in the early 2000s.\n\nI was able to examine Mountbatten's private papers at the Broadlands Archive, which prove he had a thing for space travel and avidly consumed the early literature on flying saucers, as UFOs were known at that time.\n\nPrince Charles, then Prince of Wales, was seen at the controls of 'a saucer-shaped craft with dual rotor blades' at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1975\n\nLord Mountbatten and his nephew Prince Philip at the Royal Marines barracks in October 1965\n\nThe term 'flying saucer' was first used in 1947 after pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing a chain of nine objects in the sky while flying over Washington State, describing them as flying at great speed and skipping like a 'saucer on water'.\n\nThe world was gripped and, before long, saucers were being spotted everywhere.\n\nIn 1950, Mountbatten encouraged newspaper editor Charles Eade, who had served as his press secretary during the war in the Far East, to publish 'all the available evidence' in his paper, the Sunday Dispatch.\n\nEade wanted Mountbatten to allow his name to be used in his series as it would add to its credibility \u2013 but Mountbatten refused.\n\nInstead, Eade's front-page splash, under the headline 'Flying saucers... the story that may be bigger than atom bomb wars', was credited to a source whom he described as 'one of the most famous men alive today' who 'commands universal respect and admiration'.\n\nMountbatten's theory was that they were craft from other planets, as his letters to Eade reveal: 'The available evidence shows they are not of human agency, that is to say they do not come from our Earth.\n\n'If that is so, then presumably they must come from some heavenly body, probably a planet. Maybe it is the Shackletons and Scotts of Venus or Mars who are making their first exploration of our Earth.' This interest was shared by Charles and by Prince Philip, who was among the first subscribers to the magazine Flying Saucer Review, launched in London during 1955 and edited by retired RAF pilot Derek Dempster.\n\nAccording to one of its later editors, Gordon Creighton, every copy was sent to Buckingham Palace.\n\nIn 2002 I was invited to tea by Mountbatten's youngest daughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, now 95, at her stately home in Oxfordshire to discuss the subject.\n\nShe told me how her father was fond of asking, 'Do you believe in flying saucers?' as a conversation opener during visits to royal courts and capitals across Europe.\n\nShe described a lunch with the then King Idris of Libya, when her father was Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Mediterranean. 'After the usual pleasantries there was quite a long silence and my father decided to break it by asking [through an interpreter] what for him was the burning question, 'Will you ask his majesty if he believes in flying saucers?'\n\n'There was this frightful pause, as the king thought his leg was being pulled. But when it was established that it was a genuine question, he said that of course he believed in them.\n\n'He said he had seen two of them himself and added that the Prophet recorded how a close companion of his had seen one of the fiery sphere types \u2013 as had his camel.'\n\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Edinburgh's voracious appetite for information on flying saucers was confirmed to me by RAF Air Marshal Sir Peter Horsley, who served as his equerry from 1952 to 1955.\n\nLord Mountbatten with Prince Philip and Charles at a polo match in 1977\n\nWhen I spoke to him in 2001, the year he died, he revealed he'd been tasked by his employer with finding out as much as he could on the subject and was given carte blanche to read any reports and to interview fighter pilots who had reported seeing unusual phenomena in the sky.\n\nHe told me he had arranged, with the duke's personal approval, for RAF Fighter Command to send copies of the latest sightings made by aircrew for examination at Buckingham Palace.\n\nPerhaps the strangest outcome of this inquiry was Peter Horsley's role in inviting several UFO witnesses to discuss their experiences at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThese included the captain of a BOAC airliner, James Howard, who witnessed, along with other crew members and passengers, a strange formation of UFOs while flying over the North Atlantic in June 1954.\n\nAnother visitor to the palace was schoolboy Stephen Darbishire who obtained two photographs of a 'saucer' hovering above the slopes of the Old Man of Coniston in the Lake District, in February of that year.\n\nHorsley explained his reason for inviting UFO witnesses to the palace was partly to 'put them on the spot' and to test their honesty in the presence of royalty \u2013 a method as effective as any truth serum.\n\nThey both passed the test with flying colours, convincing their esteemed hosts \u2013 and Horsley himself \u2013 that Earth had indeed had visitations from outer space.\n\nHorsley was scathing about a growing movement of cranks and fantasists, however, who he thought were making a mockery \u2013 and quite a bit of money \u2013 out of the flying saucer craze.\n\nAmong those Horsley accused of making a joke out of a very serious subject was the notorious Polish-American writer George Adamski, who co-authored the 1953 best-seller Flying Saucers Have Landed with Desmond Leslie, a former Second World War Spitfire pilot who had his own contacts in the British establishment.\n\nLeslie was friends with General Sir Frederick 'Boy' Browning, the husband of author Daphne du Maurier. After retiring from the military, Browning had become head of Princess Elizabeth's staff and, following her accession, worked for Prince Philip.\n\nBrowning was another member of what Horsley described as 'the flying saucer club' at the palace.\n\nAdamski's book contained his personal account of an alleged meeting with the Venusian pilot of a flying saucer 'scout-ship' that landed in the Mojave Desert of California, communicating with its angelic occupant by telepathy.\n\nIn April 1959, Adamski embarked on a European lecture tour that included an audience with the Dutch royal family \u2013 proving they too had caught the alien bug \u2013 and, shortly before he arrived in London, Leslie wrote to the Duke of Edinburgh, enclosing a personal invitation for them to meet Adamski, in secret if necessary.\n\nPrince Philip clearly realised the public relations danger this could place him in as he annotated Leslie's letter \u2013 now preserved in the Imperial War Museum archives \u2013 with the words, 'Not on your Nellie!', adding in a later note: 'He may not be a crank but he's a bit too fanciful for me!'\n\nHowever, despite the royal disapproval, both General Browning and Peter Horsley met Leslie and Adamski during their visit at a private address in London.\n\nHorsley told me he was not impressed by either. He felt that Desmond Leslie was 'probably sincere but gullible, sucked into the saucer cult by people who hoped to profit from it, such as Adamski' and he warned Browning against having any further contact with them.\n\nPeter Horsley's direct knowledge of the duke's interest in UFOs and other strange phenomena ended when he left the palace in 1955 to return to RAF duties. Yet the royal fascination remained.\n\nIn 1978, Lord Mountbatten joined Prince Philip and the Queen at the star-spangled royal premiere of Steven Spielberg's Hollywood blockbuster Close Encounters of the Third Kind at the Odeon in Leicester Square. The film tells the story of government conspiracy to hide the first arrival of UFOs and their friendly alien crews on Earth.\n\nOver the decades the duke had maintained an active interest in a range of esoteric subjects.\n\nDuring the 1960s, he became involved in plans for a full-scale investigation in search of the Loch Ness monster.\n\nA Conservative MP, David James, persuaded him to use his connections with the Royal Navy to push for a publicly funded expedition to Loch Ness. The MoD's Chief of Defence Staff, Sir Solly Zuckerman, raised the idea with the navy's Chief Scientist, Sir John Caroll, arguing that 'if a sonar investigation were to reveal something extraordinary in the loch, it would be of considerable scientific interest'. But Caroll blocked the idea, saying it would be too costly.\n\nRoyal interest in the arcane also extended to the crop circle phenomenon which, some argue, are created by extra-terrestrial life. One of the leading promoters of the mystery, Colin Andrews, sent a copy of his book Circular Evidence, co-written with Pat Delgado, to Queen Elizabeth.\n\nIn August of that year, The Times revealed that the book had been added to the Royal Family's 'holiday reading list'. Shortly afterwards, Andrews received a note from Buckingham Palace asking if he would provide updates 'on the latest developments on the Circles Phenomenon' for the Duke of Edinburgh, who had become a paid subscriber to his Crop Circles newsletter.\n\nBut the royals turned down Andrews' offer to provide a personal briefing on the subject, perhaps having learned lessons from the duke's earlier flirtation with George Adamski and his friends.\n\nNo one has been able to establish the full extent of the Duke of Edinburgh's personal interest in UFOs and other strange phenomena as he never mentioned the subject in media interviews.\n\nHowever, several contributors to the documentary, King Of UFOs, say that the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle include sealed files that are not to be opened until 90 years after his death \u2013 so more may yet be revealed.\n\nIn 2017, I wrote to Prince Philip to ask if correspondence on UFOs and crop circles had been preserved. I said there was considerable public interest in its contents, in particular the private study of the subject, completed on his behalf by Peter Horsley in 1955.\n\nAfter a lengthy delay, Prince Philip's private secretary, Brigadier Archie Miller-Bakewell, responded: 'I am afraid that extensive searches have not yielded any papers that would be of help to your research. This letter comes with His Royal Highness's best wishes.'\n\nIf he did know the truth, the duke \u2013 private, discreet and careful to the end \u2013 took it with him. But what about King Charles?"

        "article_content": "Area 51 is the most famous alien base shrouded in mystery and conspiracy theories\n\nAn infamous part of America has been \"revealed\" to be the home of another alien base. A lawyer, Danny Sheehan has worked to bring UFO whistleblowers to the United States Congress over recent years. Alien base conspiracy theories have cropped up time and time again but Mr Sheehan has helped to give evidence of alleged government cover-ups involving extraterrestrial beings. There have been some serious allegations made including that at the locations of two bases, hundreds of UFOs have been seen going \u201cin and out of it\u201d. Mr Sheehan spoke on Julian Dorey\u2019s podcast about the potential location of alien bases in the US.\n\nThe Arizona mountains are allegedly home to a secret alien base\n\nHe said one base is under the sea bed off the island of Isla Guadalupe and another is hidden away on land. Mr Sheehan added: \u201cThere's another base outside of Sedona, Arizona, over by a place called 'secret mount' wilderness \u2013 a totally desolate area. \u201cThere's a base there where the craft are, there's a number of them high in the mountains in remote areas of the planet and they're here now and they're extraordinarily distressed about the state of affairs (of humanity).\u201d In terms of what lies inside, Mr Sheehan claimed aliens were \u201cmantis people\u201d who could have advanced weaponry. When asked what the \u201cmantis people\u201d are, he said: \u201cThey are huge, seven feet tall, extraordinarily skinny, thin, kind of bowed over and remind people of a praying mantis... they are also called 'insectoids'. Whenever they're seen with tall greys, they seem to be in charge... giving telepathic commands.\u201d\n\nMany conspiracy theorists are keen to share their thoughts on UFO and alien sightings\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

        "article_content": "Fears of an alien invasion in the US took hold in the 1960s and 70s after reports of UFOs hovering over military bases flooded the nation.\n\nNow, decades later, a UFO expert has claimed that the extraterrestrial spaceships did visit 'every major nuclear missile base' and continue to do so to this day.\n\nRobert Hastings, who has interviewed many Army personnel about the bizarre sightings, said: 'The ones that are currently operational, have been visited repeatedly year after year according to the sources that I have interviewed.'\n\nHastings recently made waves when he revealed more than 120 former service members had come forward about their encounters with flying objects near nuclear weapon storage and testing grounds.\n\n'A public, grassroots effort must be made in the interim to understand \u2013 as best as possible, using the data gathered thus far \u2013 the nature and intentions of those who pilot the UFOs,' Hastings penned in his recent book recounting the interviews.\n\n'Or perhaps they have a use for our planet, let's say for scientific purposes, and know that global nuclear warfare will disrupt their data-gathering and/or experiments.'\n\nIn his book, UFOs and Nukes, he revealed that investigators are prevented from properly probing the cases because of dubious layers of classification.\n\nOne thing is for sure, however, it is 'obvious' that if there are extraterrestrial visitors, they are 'greatly interested in our nuclear weapons.'\n\nA UFO expert claimed that UFOs have long visited nuclear bases and continue to do so. For at least 17 nights in December 2023, swarms of small 'drones' were seen penetrating the highly restricted airspace above Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.\n\nHastings' comments echo a study released in June that analyzed over 500 of the best-supported UFO cases from the heights of the Cold War, which concluded that 'this intelligence understands atomics, and they understand atomic weaponry.'\n\nUFO reports over America's nuclear arsenal appeared to shift from sites where the bombs were made to missile silos and US air bases as the Cold War arms race grew.\n\nThe study was conducted by a retired US Air Force staff sergeant, data analyst affiliated with Harvard's UFO-hunting Galileo Project Ian Porrit and a research team.\n\nThe group focused on official military and police reports of UFOs from 1945 to 1975, avoiding poorly supported accounts and ambiguous newspaper stories, to focus on cases with multiple witnesses and signal evidence, like radar.\n\nTheir study, which only covered US cases, also used reports of UFOs spotted above non-nuclear army bases and nearby civilian centers to act as control groups to test against their findings of any UFO trends at America's sensitive nuclear installations.\n\nThe team found that data from 1948 through 1975, showed support to the idea that extraterrestrials, or some other intelligence, has methodically surveilled America's rise to a nuclear power.\n\n'This intelligence understands the developmental cycle. They have some contextual knowledge of what they're looking at and what they're looking for,' Hancock told DailyMail.com, given these shifts in reported UFO sightings over time.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1952, as America's production of atomic weapons first ramped up, waves of UFO sightings began cropping up over Washington state's Hanford nuclear production complex, as well as Los Alamos and other sites for the Manhattan Project.\n\nHastings' recent claims come just weeks after new government records surfaced other UFO waves near military sites, including Joint Base Langley-Eustis (pictured)\n\n'What we know now is that inside the Air Force for the first seven to 10 years they sincerely believed it was the Russians,' Hancock told DailyMail.com.\n\n'And when they couldn't prove that,' he said, 'it became very political.'\n\nFrom 1952 onward, their study found cases of UFOs probing near active nuclear weapons took precedence, with a wave of sightings around America's new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) starting in the 1960s.\n\n'When you get to those ICBM bases, from about 1965 to 1975, these things are occurring at night,' Hancock pointed out.\n\n'And they are they are much more intrusive. They're very low altitude, they penetrate the security perimeters of the base,' he added.\n\nHastings' recent claims come just weeks after new government records surfaced other UFO waves near military sites, including 17 nights in December 2023 when swarms of UFOs were tracked over Joint Base Langley-Eustis.\n\nThese brazen penetrations over Langley \u2014 home to at least half the Air Force's F-22 Raptor stealth fighters \u2014 led to two weeks of emergency White House meetings.\n\nTo date, Langley's mystery UFOs have eluded identification by the Pentagon, police and even NASA's high-altitude research plane, the WB-57F, called in to investigate.\n\nGeneral Glen VanHerck, the commander with North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD), who led the mission to take down the infamous Chinese spy balloon in February 2023, described that Langley wave as unlike any other known case.\n\n'If there are unknown objects within North America,' General VanHerck told the Wall Street Journal, 'go out and identify them.'\n\nSenior ex-Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com last week that the UFOs were 'swarms of smaller craft' released by 'motherships.'\n\nHe explained that was 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\nMellon told DailyMail.com: 'I make no claims regarding their origin, perhaps many are Chinese drones.'\n\n'[But] in some instances,' Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'"

Western Slope Paranormal is a group of local investigators studying potential hauntings.\n\nThe Elk\u2019s Lodge, Avalon Theater, and The Goat and Cover Tavern are few of the many local haunted stops on the ghost walk. Paranormal Investigator, Nina Carrillo, says activity is often detected using a flash light. During investigations she sets it in an area away from her, and asks questions promoting a response. Often times activity will reply by turning on the light, without anyone touching it.\n\nInvestigators also works with local community members and businesses to address their concerns of paranormal activity. They travel to private residencies and conduct investigations, answering questions and help provide peace of mind.\n\nWhile Halloween wraps up the ghost walks for the season, the organization remains involved with the community by hosting fundraisers and monthly meetings. If you are interested in reaching out, visit their Facebook page and send a direct message.\n\nCopyright 2024 KJCT. All rights reserved."

It is newsworthy when archeologists and paleontologists find a new location that contains fossils, but what about the first fossil discovery?\n\nChrissy: The earliest recorded discovery of a remnant of dinosaur history was in 1676 when Robert Plot found a huge thigh bone in England. Back in the early 17th century, dinosaurs weren't something that were part of public common knowledge, so these finds were either thought to belong to huge humans or mythical creatures.\n\nJasmine: It wasn't until the early 1800's that it was suspected that giant animals once roamed the earth and not giant humans. Gideon Mantell found a gigantic fossil while digging in the Sussex quarry which turned out to be one of the first known lguanodon teeth to ever be found. This was a key turning point in how scientists dug for and classified fossils.\n\nChrissy: A quest for paleontology supremacy brought forth the discovery of many new dinosaur genre during the American Gilded Age of the 19th Century. \"The Bone Wars\", a fierce and underhanded competition between Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope, saw the use of bribery, theft, destruction of bones, funding tampering, and public attacks in scientific publications that went on to publicly ruin both men financially and in reputation. Their losses brought forth gains for the Stegosaurus, Allosaurus, and Triceratops.\n\nJasmine: In the mid 1800's the word \"dinosaur\" was first coined by Sir Richard Owen, an English biologist and paleontologist. He recognized these giant ancient animals as the order of Dinosauria and began the modern era of dinosaur research and classification.\n\nChrissy: You've been listening to The Sound of Science on WNIJ, where you learn something new every day."

        "article_content": "Prime numbers may not be at the forefront of everyday conversation, but for Luke Durant, a 36-year-old former programmer at Nvidia, they represent a captivating challenge that led him to an astonishing achievement. After dedicating nearly a year of his life and a significant investment of his own resources, Durant has uncovered the largest known prime number to date, a monumental feat in the realm of mathematics.\n\nWhat Is A Prime Number?\n\nTo understand the significance of Durant\u2019s discovery, it\u2019s essential to define prime numbers. A prime number is any whole number greater than one that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers; it can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. Common examples include 2, 3, 5, and 7. Durant\u2019s discovery, known as M136279841, boasts an extraordinary 41,024,320 digits, marking it the first significant prime breakthrough in nearly six years.\n\nThe Significance Of Mersenne Primes\n\nThe prime number unearthed by Durant is classified as a Mersenne prime, a category named after the French monk Marin Mersenne, who studied these unique numbers over 350 years ago. Mersenne primes are exceedingly rare and can only be expressed in the form 2\u1d56-1, where p itself is a prime number. This particular discovery stands out as the 52nd known Mersenne prime, adding to the historical significance of the find.\n\nDr. Kevin Buzzard, a professor of pure mathematics at Imperial College London, emphasized the importance of such discoveries. \u201cThe historical record of the world\u2019s largest prime tells us something about the historical capability of computers, and in particular, it tells us something about the progress of humanity in this area,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Role Of GIMPS In Discovering Primes\n\nDurant\u2019s groundbreaking achievement was announced by the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) on October 21. GIMPS is a citizen science project that encourages volunteers worldwide to run software on their personal computers to search for new prime numbers. According to Durant, \u201cI recognized that the GIMPS community has put together an incredible system with amazing technology for searching for huge prime numbers.\u201d\n\nAfter familiarizing himself with GIMPS\u2019s software and leveraging cloud computing capabilities, Durant effectively created a powerful supercomputer by combining resources from systems around the globe.\n\nThe question arises: what drives thousands of volunteers, including Durant, to seek out the world\u2019s largest primes? For Durant, it is a blend of his fascination with developing large computing systems and exploring the boundaries of physics and computational capabilities. \u201cI wanted to push the boundaries of the known universe in whatever small way I was able,\u201d he explained. \u201cThese enormous prime numbers are, in some senses, the largest \u2018unique pieces of information\u2019 in the known universe.\u201d\n\nHow It Actually Happened?\n\nDespite the lack of practical applications for extremely large prime numbers, the significance of such finds remains profound for the community involved. George Woltman, founder of GIMPS, described the discovery as a \u201crare and beautiful gem\u201d for mathematics enthusiasts. He expressed hope that these discoveries could inspire future generations of mathematicians.\n\nDurant received an initial alert regarding his discovery on October 12, just as he was preparing for a trip. \u201cI took a moment to decide if I felt up to work on it immediately to confirm the new number to be prime,\u201d he recalled. He ultimately chose to prioritize his discovery, recognizing its importance.\n\nTo confirm the primality of a number, GIMPS utilizes a series of tests, starting with a probable prime test. If successful, the number undergoes multiple definitive tests across different systems to verify its status as a new Mersenne prime.\n\nEven for someone with Durant\u2019s experience, the exhilaration of the discovery was palpable. \u201cI\u2019m extremely fortunate to be the discoverer of the most recent Mersenne prime number,\u201d he said. He expressed his readiness to invest significant effort, fully aware of the challenges involved in such an ambitious pursuit.\n\nDurant\u2019s achievement is particularly noteworthy as the first Mersenne prime found utilizing graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs excel at performing mathematical calculations rapidly and handling multiple data streams simultaneously. This advancement signifies a notable shift in prime number discovery methods, moving away from traditional central processing units (CPUs).\n\nMihai Preda, who developed the GpuOwl software available to GIMPS users since 2017, played a vital role in paving the way for Durant\u2019s groundbreaking discovery. The GPUs that Durant employed demonstrated remarkable efficiency in executing repetitive mathematical calculations, enhancing his computational capabilities significantly.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nWoltman anticipates that the utilization of GPUs will lead to more discoveries of prime numbers in the future. \u201cGPUs are so good at tackling difficult number crunching compared to CPUs which are suited to a wide variety of problems,\u201d he remarked. However, he also noted that CPUs will continue to play a critical role in GIMPS and could potentially yield the next prime number.\n\nDurant attributes much of his success to his education at the Alabama School of Mathematics and Science in Mobile, which fostered his interests and technical skills. \u201cMy interests and technical abilities are in no small part due to my fellow students and faculty at ASMS,\u201d he shared.\n\nAs a result of his groundbreaking discovery, Durant is eligible for GIMPS\u2019s research discovery award of $3,000. He plans to donate this prize money to a public high school, hoping to inspire future generations in mathematics. \u201cI\u2019m glad to have a result that can help show a little bit about a special place in the South,\u201d he expressed.\n\nMUST READ | Is China Set To Outpace the U.S. In Mars Sample Returns?"

        "article_content": "Hidden deep in the frosty expanse of the Greenland Ice Sheet, an intriguing secret has been lurking \u2013 a significant amount of meltwater temporarily held within its icy mantle during the summertime.\n\nIt\u2019s a discovery that not only challenges our existing understanding of ice sheets and their role in sea-level rise but also signals the need for a paradigm shift in climate change models.\n\nA mystery on the Greenland ice sheet\n\nDespite being the largest single contributor to global sea-level rise, scientists have so far been unable to answer how the storage of meltwater within the Greenland Ice Sheet evolves throughout the summer melt season.\n\nHowever, a unique approach has now offered significant insight into the movement and storage of this meltwater. The research was led by Jiangjun Ran, a professor in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the Southern University of Science and Technology in China.\n\n\u201cDuring the melt season, we found that a significant fraction of meltwater mass is stored temporarily within the ice sheet. This water buffering effect peaks in July and slowly recedes in the following weeks,\u201d noted Professor Ran.\n\nWater dynamics within the ice sheet\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how water is stored and released within the ice sheet has always been a challenge,\u201d said Pavel Ditmar, a scientist in the Department of Geoscience and Remote Sensing at Delft University of Technology.\n\nTo overcome this, the team turned to data from the Greenland GPS Network (GNET). The network consists of tens of stations around Greenland, providing continuous positioning data.\n\nThe data was used to develop a method capable of interpreting the detected vertical displacements of the bedrock caused, among other things, by the mass of melting water.\n\nReshaping climate models\n\nThis discovery could revolutionize climate models, which often fail to capture the intricacy of water storage within ice sheets.\n\nEspecially in warmer years, these models may underestimate the process of water runoff towards the ocean.\n\nThe researchers found that the predictions could require scaling adjustments of up to 20% for the warmest years.\n\n\u201cThese findings are crucial for improving forecasts of the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s contribution to future sea-level rise,\u201d said Michiel van den Broeke, a scholar from Utrecht University.\n\n\u201cWith climate change making the Arctic warmer than ever, accurate predictions are essential for preparing coastal regions for potential sea-level rise.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding ice sheet dynamics\n\nThis significant breakthrough in understanding the behavior of polar ice wasn\u2019t an overnight success. It required years of meticulous preparation and arduous expeditions to remote corners of the planet.\n\nShfaqat Abbas Khan, a scholar from the Technical University of Denmark noted: \u201cThe work we\u2019ve done not only improves our understanding of ice sheet dynamics but also opens the door to new measurement techniques and campaigns.\u201d\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the discovery highlights the importance of international collaboration in confronting our shared environmental challenges, as we continue our journey to protect the delicate balance of life on this planet.\n\nClimate insights from Greenland\u2019s ice sheet\n\nThe impact of these new findings extends beyond Greenland\u2019s icy borders. If similar meltwater storage mechanisms exist in other ice-covered regions, such as Antarctica or the Himalayas, climate models may need further adjustments.\n\nBy factoring in these complex water storage processes, scientists can refine global sea-level rise predictions and provide more accurate timelines.\n\nThis broader understanding can help nations better prepare for climate impacts on coastal communities and freshwater supplies, highlighting the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s role in shaping the global climate.\n\nThis breakthrough would not have been possible without advancements in technology.\n\nTools like the Greenland GPS Network (GNET) have revolutionized the way scientists gather data, providing real-time insights into changes deep within the ice.\n\nThe use of these advanced techniques, from GPS-based monitoring to satellite imagery, is paving the way for further discoveries in polar research.\n\nWith these tools, researchers hope to continue uncovering Greenland\u2019s secrets and apply these findings to other remote and difficult-to-study ice sheets, accelerating the pace of climate science.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Nature.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe 47-year-old Voyager 1 spacecraft is back in touch with NASA \u2014 but not out of the woods \u2014 after a technical issue caused a days-long communications blackout with the historic mission, which is billions of miles away in interstellar space.\n\nVoyager 1 is now using a radio transmitter it hasn\u2019t relied on since 1981 to stay in contact with its team on Earth while engineers work to understand what went wrong.\n\nAs the spacecraft, launched in September 1977, ages, the team has slowly turned off components to conserve power, allowing Voyager 1 to send back unique science data from 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) away.\n\nThe probe is the farthest spacecraft from Earth, operating beyond the heliosphere \u2014 the sun\u2019s bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends well beyond Pluto\u2019s orbit \u2014 where its instruments directly sample interstellar space.\n\nThe new issue is one of several the aging vehicle has faced in recent months, but Voyager\u2019s team keeps finding creative solutions so the storied explorer can zoom along on its cosmic journey through uncharted territory.\n\nNASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft is depicted in this artist's concept traveling through interstellar space, or the space between stars, which it entered in 2012. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nA radio glitch billions of miles away\n\nOccasionally, engineers send commands to Voyager 1 to turn on some of its heaters and warm components that have sustained radiation damage over the decades, said Bruce Waggoner, the Voyager mission assurance manager. The heat can help reverse the radiation damage, which degrades the performance of the spacecraft\u2019s components, he said.\n\nMessages are relayed to Voyager from mission control at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, through the agency\u2019s Deep Space Network. The system of radio antennas on Earth helps the agency communicate with Voyager 1 and its twin probe, Voyager 2, as well as other spacecraft exploring our solar system.\n\nVoyager 1 then sends back engineering data to show how it is responding to the commands. It takes about 23 hours for a message to travel one way.\n\nBut when a command to the heater was sent on October 16, something triggered the spacecraft\u2019s autonomous fault protection system. If the spacecraft draws more power than it should, the fault protection system automatically shuts off systems that aren\u2019t essential to conserve power.\n\nThe team discovered the latest issue when it couldn\u2019t detect the spacecraft\u2019s response signal through the Deep Space Network on October 18.\n\nVoyager 1 has been using one of its two radio transmitters, called an X-band based on the frequency it utilizes, for decades. Meanwhile, the other transmitter, called the S-band, which uses a different frequency, hasn\u2019t been employed since 1981 because its signal is much fainter than the X-band\u2019s.\n\nEngineers suspect the fault protection system lowered the rate at which data was being sent back from the transmitter, which changed the nature of the signal shared by Voyager 1 to the Deep Space Network monitors. The Voyager 1 team ultimately located the probe\u2019s response later on October 18 by sifting through signals the Deep Space Network was receiving.\n\nBut on October 19, communication with Voyager 1 appeared to stop completely.\n\nThe team believes the fault protection system was additionally triggered two more times, which may have switched off the X-band transmitter and shifted the spacecraft to the S-band transmitter that uses less power, NASA said.\n\nWorking on a solution\n\nWhile Voyager 1\u2019s team wasn\u2019t sure that the faint S-band signal would be detectable due to the spacecraft\u2019s distance from Earth, Deep Space Network engineers located it.\n\nThe team won\u2019t send commands to Voyager 1 to turn on the X-band transmitter again until it deduces what triggered the fault protection system, which could take weeks. Engineers are being cautious because they want to determine whether there are any potential risks to turning on the X-band.\n\nIf the team can get the X-band transmitter working again, the device may be able to relay data that could reveal what happened, Waggoner said.\n\nIn the meantime, engineers sent a message to Voyager 1 on October 22 to check that the S-band transmitter was working and received confirmation on October 24. But it\u2019s not a fix the team wants to rely on for too long.\n\n\u201cThe S-band signal is too weak to use long term,\u201d Waggoner said. \u201cSo far, the team has not been able to use it to get telemetry (information about the health and status of the spacecraft), let alone science data. But it allows us to at least send commands and make sure the spacecraft is still pointed at Earth.\u201d\n\nThis transmitter switch is just one of several innovative hacks NASA has used to overcome communication challenges with the long-lived mission this year, including firing up old thrusters to keep Voyager 1\u2019s antenna pointed at Earth and coming up with a solution for a computer glitch that silenced the probe\u2019s stream of science data to Earth for months."

        "article_content": "Generative AI is as trendy as it has ever been.\n\nThis year, research into AI was awarded Nobel Prizes, and the largest tech companies in the world pumped AI into as many products as possible. The U.S. government promoted AI as a driver in creating a clean-energy economy and a strategic pillar for federal spending. But what\u2019s next for 2025?\n\nThe trend of generative AI in the last few months of 2024 points to a greater push for adoption from tech companies. Meanwhile, the results as to whether AI products and processes see ROI for enterprise software buyers are mixed. While it\u2019s difficult to foresee how AI will continue to shape the tech industry, experts have offered predictions based on current trends.\n\nRespondents to an IEEE study in September rated AI as one of the top three areas of technology that will be most critical in 2025 in 58% of cases. Conversely, nearly all respondents (91%) agree that 2025 will see \u201ca generative AI reckoning\u201d regarding what the technology can or should do. Expectations for generative AI are high, but the success of projects leveraging it remains uncertain.\n\n1. AI agents will be the next buzzword\n\nBased on my research and observations, the use of AI agents will surge in 2025.\n\nAI agents are semi-autonomous generative AI that can chain together or interact with applications to carry out instructions in an unstructured environment. For example, Salesforce uses AI agents to call sales leads. As with generative AI, the definition of an agent\u2019s capabilities is unclear. IBM defines it as an AI that can reason through complex problems, such as OpenAI o1. However, not all products billed as AI agents can reason that way.\n\nRegardless of their capabilities, AI agents and their use cases will likely be at the forefront of generative AI marketing in 2025. AI \u201cagents\u201d could be the next stage of evolution for this year\u2019s AI \u201ccopilots.\u201d AI agents could spend time working through multi-stage jobs independently while their human counterpart handles another task.\n\n2. AI will both help and hurt security teams\n\nBoth cybersecurity attackers and defenders will continue to take advantage of AI in 2025. 2024 has already seen the proliferation of generative AI security products. These products can write code, detect threats, answer thorny questions, or serve as a \u201crubber duck\u201d for brainstorming.\n\nBut generative AI may present information that is inaccurate. Security professionals may spend as much time double-checking the output as they would if they had performed the work themselves. Failing to review such information can lead to broken code and even more security issues.\n\n\u201cAs AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini become deeply integrated into business operations, the risk of accidental data exposure skyrockets with new data privacy challenges,\u201d Jeremy Fuchs, cyber security evangelist at Check Point Software Technologies, said in an email to TechRepublic. \u201cIn 2025, organizations must move swiftly to implement strict controls and governance over AI usage, ensuring the benefits of these technologies don\u2019t come at the cost of data privacy and security.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI models are susceptible to malicious actors like any other software, particularly via jailbreak attacks.\n\n\u201cAI\u2019s growing role in cyber crime is undeniable,\u201d Fuchs explained. \u201cBy 2025, AI will not only enhance the scale of attacks but also their sophistication. Phishing attacks will be harder to detect, with AI continuously learning and adapting.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI can make conventional methods of identifying phishing emails \u2014 poor grammar or out-of-the-blue messages \u2014 obsolete. Disinformation security will become more important as AI-generated videos, audio, and text proliferate. As a result, security teams must adapt to both using and defending against generative AI \u2014 just as they have adapted to other significant changes in business technology, such as the large-scale migration to the cloud.\n\n3. Businesses will evaluate whether AI delivers ROI\n\n\u201cThe pendulum has swung from \u2018new AI innovation at any cost\u2019 to a resounding imperative to prove ROI in board rooms across the world,\u201d Uzi Dvir, global CIO at digital adoption platform company WalkMe, said in an email. \u201cSimilarly, employees are asking themselves if it\u2019s worth the time and effort to figure out how to use these new technologies for their specific roles.\u201d\n\nOrganizations struggle to determine whether generative AI adds value and to what use cases it can make the most difference. Organizations that adopt AI often face high costs and unclear goals. It can be difficult to quantify the benefits of generative AI use, where those benefits manifest, and what to compare them to.\n\nThis challenge is a side effect of the integration of generative AI into many other applications. It makes some decision-makers wonder whether generative AI add-ons truly boost the value of those applications. AI tiers can be costly, and over the next year, more companies are expected to rigorously test \u2014 and sometimes discard \u2014 the features that don\u2019t deliver results.\n\nMany companies that are incorporating generative AI at a large scale are seeing success. At its Q3 earnings call, Google attributed this result to its AI infrastructure and products such as AI Overviews. However, Meta reported that AI may significantly increase capital expenditures, even as user numbers decline.\n\nSEE: Google Cloud is previewing its sixth generation of the AI accelerator Trillium.\n\n4. AI will make a major impact on scientific research\n\nAlong with impacting enterprise productivity, contemporary AI has seen significant movement in science.\n\nFour of 2024\u2019s Nobel Prize winners used AI:\n\nDemis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google DeepMind won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for predicting the structure of proteins with AlphaFold2.\n\nJohn J. Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the Nobel Prize for Physics for their decades-spanning work developing neural networks.\n\nThe White House held a summit on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 about the use of AI in life sciences, highlighting how AI enables solutions to complex challenges in ways that impact the world. This trend is likely to continue into next year as generative AI models grow and mature.\n\n5. The environmental tools made with AI won\u2019t offset its energy toll\n\nEnergy efficiency is another buzzword in AI.\n\nBut for every use case in which AI can help predict weather patterns or optimize energy use, there is another story about the environmental cost of building the data centers needed to run generative AI. Such construction requires massive amounts of electricity and water \u2014 and rising global temperatures only compound the problem. It\u2019s unlikely an equilibrium will be reached in this large-scale problem.\n\nFor businesses, though, expect to see companies touting dubious and genuine claims of energy savings and environmental friendliness around AI. Consider the resource use attached to your organization\u2019s AI strategy.\n\nWhat are the most popular generative AI products?\n\nThe most well-known generative AI products are:\n\nChatGPT, the OpenAI chatbot\n\nGoogle Gemini\n\nMicrosoft Copilot\n\nGPT-4, the large language model behind ChatGPT\n\nDALL-E 3, an image generator\n\nWhat is the most advanced generative AI?\n\nVarious tests have been proposed as potential criteria for determining the most advanced generative AI. Some organizations rate their models on human educational benchmarks, such as the International Mathematics Olympiad or Codeforce competitions.\n\nOther evaluations, such as Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding, were explicitly created for generative AI. Google\u2019s Gemini Ultra, China Mobile\u2019s Jiutian, and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o sit at the top of the MMLU leaderboard today."
