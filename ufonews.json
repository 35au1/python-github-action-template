It was one of three unidentified objects blasted out of the sky that month, according to CTV News.\n\nIt remains unclear what the object was and what it was doing flying over western Canada."

            "source": "The Verge",
            "article_content": "There\u2019s endless hype around generative AI this year, and app developers have clearly been paying attention. AI-focused tools are blowing up Apple\u2019s App Store charts in almost every category, occupying top 10 rankings across education, productivity, and photo editing. Opportunities are particularly rife for free graphics and design apps, a category that\u2019s positively saturated with AI content creation tools.\n\nBut quantity doesn\u2019t mean quality \u2014 and a great many of these apps are bewilderingly bad. I\u2019ve been using some of the most popular offerings to understand the state of AI tools as we head into 2025. And for every serious attempt to make AI useful, there seem to be several more designed to cash in on the hype: quietly paywalling features they advertise behind pricey subscriptions and greatly misrepresenting the results that users can achieve, if the app even works at all.\n\nAround half of the App Store\u2019s top 10 graphics and design apps have \u201cAI\u201d in the name, and three of them are all made by the same company \u2014 HUBX, an app developer founded in 2022 that\u2019s based in Turkey. One of its apps, DaVinci AI, is advertised as an AI image generator with some photo editing features. Almost every tool is locked behind a $30 annual (or $5 weekly) subscription fee, and the free trial only unlocks a subpar text-to-image feature that gives you a choice between using unspecified versions of Stable Diffusion and DALL-E AI models.\n\nMy prompt was simple \u2014 \u201ca photorealistic dragon flying over a volcano\u201d \u2014 but the results were full of errors like missing wings and weird perspectives. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe images it produces are low-quality and resized or cropped incorrectly. In-app ads appear when you click pretty much any link. The UI is unpleasant to navigate. If you do pay for the full version, you can\u2019t download any edited images without slapping an ugly watermark on it. And yet, it sits far above the rankings for more recognizable creative platforms like Microsoft Designer, which has its own built-in text-to-image AI generator. Adobe Express is the only design-focused app in the same category that currently ranks above DaVinci AI.\n\nDaVinci AI did a decent job of removing a zebra from the right side of the image. There\u2019s no way to download AI-edited images without this watermark, though, and every result is forcibly cropped and warped. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe other two high-ranking HUBX products I tested were just as lackluster: the Home AI \u201cinterior design\u201d app spits out hallucination-riddled images of rooms that are barely usable even as concept plans, and the Tattoo AI app refused to work entirely. Both apps have the same feature paywalls and review pop-up reminders as DaVinci AI. The copy and pasted App Store version history notes across all HUBX products are also devoid of any details.\n\nWhile all three apps feature a surprisingly large number of five-star reviews, the user feedback across social media and the App Store comments is overwhelmingly negative. A recurring complaint is that customer service is impossible to get ahold of. HUBX never responded to my requests for comment.\n\nHere\u2019s the reference image I plugged into Home AI... Image: Home AI / The Verge ...and the \u201cTropical\u201d themed results. Why is the bed now made of melting wood? Why does the desk merge into the chair? How is this remotely helpful? Image: Home AI / The Verge\n\nApps that clearly advertise having AI features are highly attractive. According to Sensor Tower, four out of the top 10 most downloaded iOS graphics and design apps in the US so far this year have had \u201cAI\u201d somewhere in their title. That\u2019s actually two fewer than last year, but the most popular apps are booming. Photoroom saw downloads increase by more than 160 percent since last year. Comparatively, Photoshop Express downloads on iOS \u2014 which also includes generative AI features \u2014 fell by 21 percent during the same period.\n\nAI-focused creative apps aren\u2019t all bad, but the app market saturation makes it harder to find the good ones that use the technology in more focused ways. Apps like Google\u2019s Magic Editor and Adobe Photoshop have specific tools for removing unwanted objects from photos or inserting new ones in specific places. Smaller developers that provide similar features and perform those tasks well are also climbing the App Store rankings.\n\nFor example, Photoroom and Picsart AI \u2014 all-in-one graphic design apps akin to platforms like Canva and Adobe Express \u2014 are actually pretty good! They rank highly in the free \u201cPhoto and Video\u201d App Store category and provide a similar variety of features to quickly create online content using premade digital assets and templates, alongside some AI-powered editing tools like automatic background and object removal.\n\nThe Picsart remove tool is easy to use and does a decent-enough job \u2014 nothing feels underwhelming or misleading. Image: Picsart / The Verge and Image: Picsart / The Verge\n\nNeither app blew me away, but they did exactly what they advertised: the background removal features aren\u2019t as good as Canva\u2019s, but they did the job, and object removal erased undesirable aspects of photos even if it wasn\u2019t as convincing as Google\u2019s Magic Editor. Both apps lock some of their more premium editing features and digital assets behind a $13 monthly subscription, which is pretty standard if you\u2019re being upfront about it \u2014 individual Canva and Adobe Express subscriptions start at $15 and $10 per month, respectively, by comparison.\n\nThere\u2019s also a noticeable divide between the iPhone and iPad charts \u2014 very few AI-focused names appear in the top 100 free or paid list for the iPad, which instead feature a more diverse range of graphic design apps like Adobe Fresco, Clip Studio Paint, and Canva. And interestingly, the list of top paid iPhone apps looks very similar. There\u2019s an abundance of sketching and 3D modeling platforms, premium reference materials for artists, and tools that streamline specific creative tasks like removing backgrounds and resizing images.\n\nThe divide suggests the spammy AI app phenomenon is a mass-market one that hasn\u2019t quite caught on with traditional photographers and illustrators who still want to use their tried-and-true apps. It also suggests that AI itself holds less appeal if users are expected to pay for it, which tracks with the kind of creative AI apps that appear most frequently \u2014 custom tattoos, logo makers, and interior design \u2014 which are skilled services that usually require payment. People don\u2019t necessarily want to remove the skill barrier; they want to remove the financial one."

            "article_content": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. - Coughing can intensify at night, and a new AI technology is here to track your cough patterns while you sleep, even giving you insights about the places you visit regularly.\n\nSleep Cycle, a leader in sleep technology, is introducing a free \u201cCough Radar\u201d feature that tracks your coughing events and their frequency while you sleep, and also provides insights at the community level.\n\n\u201cCough Radar helps users understand the spread of respiratory-related illnesses in their area, empowering them to make informed choices,\u201d said Mikael K\u00e5geb\u00e4ck, Chief Technology Officer at Sleep Cycle. \u201cFor example, if there is a large coughing cloud in the area you were planning to go shopping, you might opt to go to a less crowded center or shop online.\u201d\n\nThe Sleep Cycle app is best known for its mobile platform, which uses analysis to monitor sleep patterns. It tracks factors such as sleep duration, sleep stages (light, deep, REM), sleep quality based on movement and sound, time taken to fall asleep, sleep consistency and more.\n\nThe Cough Radar premium feature, marking its one-year anniversary, detects and tracks personal nighttime cough patterns, and tells users if coughing levels are normal, high or elevated. It also alerts users when coughing levels rise in their area, providing real-time community coughing trends through an interactive map that visualizes \u201ccoughing clouds\u201d in regions with heightened illness risk.\n\nThis feature will be free to users from Dec. 9 through the end of February next year.\n\n\u201cWhile Cough Radar tracks cough frequency, it is important to note that it doesn\u2019t diagnose underlying causes,\u201d said Michael Gradisar, Head of Sleep Science at Sleep Cycle. \u201cMost factors related to cough spread are within our control, and with the awareness our communities have gained in recent years, we can use data to make educated choices and reduce anxiety around illness.\u201d\n\nAccording to their release, user location data is anonymized. Coughing data is only collected in areas with at least 125 users within a 7.5-kilometer radius.\n\nCoughs can be triggered by various factors, including the common cold, viruses like COVID-19, flu and RSV, as well as conditions such as croup, asthma, acid reflux and others.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s possible to get sick at any time of year, doctors generally consider cold and flu season to run from October to March, when infections are most widespread."

(WVVA) - Appalachian Ghost Tours, a paranormal investigation group, spent the night in the Powerhouse ATV Lodge and Mansion, also known as the Maybeury Mansion, with the hopes of discovering and communicating with spirits said to inhabit the location.\n\nThe group hopes that their endeavors will strengthen the paranormal tourism market in the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an opportunity to give it some growth, some exposure to tell those stories. Honestly, I feel like the paranormal tourism is growing by leaps and bounds,\u201d says Pamela Huff, member of Appalachian Ghost Tours. \u201cThey just came up with the paranormal trail where people are checking in at the different sites. I think it has potential to be absolutely huge.\u201d\n\nPotentially finding paranormal activity, members have seen a market for tourism and want to introduce tourists to their interests. Huff goes on to add:\n\nWe have realized that there is a market for tourism in West Virginia. We have targeted the smaller towns such as Maybeury. We\u2019re working with the town of Hinton. We\u2019re working with the town of Pocahontas. We have an event in Mount Hope. So we\u2019re looking at these towns that maybe could use the economic development and trying to bring in those tourism dollars to them while doing something that we love and introducing others to our hobby.\n\nThe Executive Director of the group, Mark Covey, says that when it comes to paranormal activity, it can take experiencing it to believe in it.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt, if you are curious about it, it doesn\u2019t hurt to try, and then sometimes you\u2019ll get something, sometimes you\u2019ll get nothing. But to me, seeing is believing,\u201d said Covey. \u201cI was a skeptic forever, and then I was somewhere, and a door opened up just randomly. So that just made me believe, and to me it\u2019s just seeing is believing.\u201d\n\nMembers of the group say they did pick up on unexplained activity in the house during their investigation, which may have been paranormal.\n\nFor more information you can find Appalachian Ghost Tours on Facebook. If you\u2019re interested in checking out the house, it\u2019s available for rent on their website.\n\nCopyright 2024 WVVA. All rights reserved."

            "article_content": "Orbs are very common in paranormal photography and video. In digital photography, orbs are a known artifact of the process. The Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena (ASSAP) explains this in their case study on Orb Zone Theory.\n\nIn the case of digital and film photography where colored orbs appear, this is often associated with the subtle coloring of the camera's lens.\n\nOther items can cause orbs to appear, including reflective surfaces, dust, rain, water spots, and bugs.\n\nIn video, infrared lights can reflect off of these same objects and give them a lighted orb-like appearance. People often mistake bugs and dust as flying orbs. These appear even as flying orbs in houses that are well cleaned and not dusty as infrared light easily picks up even the smallest amounts of dust.\n\nFor these reasons, many paranormal investigators do not consider orbs as paranormal evidence because there are too many natural world explanations for them. However, it is a possibility that some orbs could be paranormal in nature. This may be particularly true of orbs seen with the naked eye, especially those that appear to have their own light source and unusual patterns of travel."

            "article_content": "An archaeologist on a quest to find the long-lost tomb of Cleopatra VII has made a 'significant' discovery at a site believe to be queen's final resting place.\n\nKathleen Martinez, who has been searching for the tomb for nearly 20 years, uncovered a statue that may depict the true face of the queen who ruled 51 to 30 BC.\n\nThe white marble statue, which is just the head, features the likeness of a woman with a small nose, pouty lips and the hair braided around the head.\n\nMartinez and her team also found 337 coins bearing the image of Cleopatra, along with an assortment of pottery, oil lamps, figurines and other artifacts at the Temple of Taposiris Magna.\n\nThe expert has long believed the queen's tomb has been hiding somewhere in the temple's ruins, which sit atop a 4,281-foot-long tunnel 43 feet underground.\n\nMartinez believes Cleopatra's body was moved from the palace through the tunnel and buried at a secret location.\n\nHowever, other archaeologists have suggested that the statue depicts another royal woman.\n\nCritics of Martinez have also slammed her theory of the queen's burial, saying Cleopatra was laid to rest in the city of Alexandria, not 25 miles outside of it.\n\nArchaeologists have uncovered a statue that may depict Cleopatra VII, the Egyptian Queen famous for her beauty and intelligence who ruled 51 to 30 BC\n\nCleopatra ruled from 51 BC to 30 BC - right up until the day she died. She was the queen of Egypt and the last and most famous of the Ptolemaic dynasty\n\nThis is another 'significant finding,' according to Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities.\n\nThe Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has said that discoveries at Taposiris Magna are crucial for improving experts' understanding of the architectural, cultural and ceremonial practices of the time.\n\nIn addition to the potential statue of Cleopatra, Martinez and her team also unearthed a limestone bust of a king adorned with the Nemes, the ceremonial headdress of the pharaohs.\n\nMartinez led a team of Egyptian and Dominican archaeologists for this dig, conducted in collaboration with the National University Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a,\n\nThe researchers discovered foundation deposits beneath the southern wall of the temple's outer enclosure, according to a statement.\n\nThe female statue was the most significant finding, some experts have questioned whether it actually depicts Cleopatra, as Martinez believes.\n\nOthers have pointed out differences in facial features between the statue and the ancient Queen, suggesting that it may depict a princess instead.\n\nBut this artifact isn't the only discovery that bears Cleopatra's resemblance.\n\nMartinez and her team also found more than 300 coins, many of which are decorated with her image.\n\nOther notable findings include a scarab-shaped amulet inscribed with the phrase 'The justice of Ra has shone,' a bronze ring dedicated to the goddess Hathor and ancient burial sites.\n\nThe statue and other artifacts - including coins engraved with Cleopatra's face as well as an assortment of pottery, oil lamps, figurines and more - were found at the Taposiris Magna temple complex 25 miles west of Alexandria\n\nMartinez and her team also found more than 300 coins, many of which are decorated with Cleopatra's image\n\nThe researchers discovered a large cemetery containing 20 burial chambers, and a tomb with three chambers beneath the Taposiris Magna lighthouse.\n\nMartinez discovered the tunnel in 2022, which was said to resemble the Tunnel of Eupalinos on the Greek island of Samos \u2013 revered as one of the most important engineering achievements of the Classical world.\n\nMartinez told Heritage Key in 2022: 'If there's a oneper cent chance that the last queen of Egypt could be buried there, it is my duty to search for her.\n\n'This is the first time that any archeologist has found tunnels, passages underground [and] inside the enclosure walls of the temple, so we have changed forever what they know about the architecture.'\n\nThe archaeologist believes that, after Mark Antony killed himself following his defeat to Caesar Augustus, also known as Octavian, Cleopatra put detailed plans in place for them both to be buried there, in echoes of the myth.\n\nIn addition, the mission found the remains of a Greek temple dating back to the fourth century BC. It was destroyed between the second century BC and the beginning of the AD era.\n\nMartinez and her team also found 337 coins bearing the image of Cleopatra, along with an assortment of pottery, oil lamps, figurines and o ther artifacts at the Temple of Taposiris Magna\n\nMartinez discovered the tunnel in 2022, which was said to resemble the Tunnel of Eupalinos on the Greek island of Samos \u2013 revered as one of the most important engineering achievements of the Classical world\n\nThat temple is connected to a complex underground tunnel system that stretches from Lake Mariout to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAnalysis of ceramic fragments uncovered by the dig also confirmed that the construction of the Taposiris Magna temple dates to the 1st century BC.\n\nThe temple's name means 'great tomb of Osiris,' suggesting it was dedicated to the god Osiris and his queen - the goddess Isis - who Cleopatra was believed to be a reincarnation of.\n\nToday, Taposiris Magna is in ruins because the Egyptian coastline was battered by earthquakes over the centuries, causing parts of the temple to collapse and sink into the sea.\n\nThe site has been excavated multiple times, with the first dig dispatched by Napoleon in the early 19th century.\n\nMartinez first began investigating the site in 2005, as she believes that Cleopatra may have been laid to rest there after her suicide in 30 BC.\n\nShe thinks that Cleopatra\u2019s death was a ceremonial act - part of a ritual apotheosis, or the shedding of her mortal body to ascend to the states of a goddess.\n\nIf that were true, she would have been buried in a temple, most likely a temple erected in the name of Iris.\n\nOver the last 20 years, Martinez has made numerous discoveries that strengthen experts' understanding of the Ptolemaic period, including skeletal remains, but she still has not found the ancient queen's tomb."

            "article_content": "In September 2004, NASA\u2019s Genesis return sample capsule tumbled from the sky and slammed into the Utah desert in a remote part of the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground, shattering the delicate solar wind collectors it carried. The upshot of that downfall: new scientific insights following over 20 years of painstaking work by researchers sorting through the spacecraft\u2019s contaminated remains.\n\nGenesis was loaded with delicate wafers that held precious samples of atoms and ions from puffs of solar wind that the probe accumulated while lingering at Lagrange Point 1, the spot in space where Earth\u2019s and the sun\u2019s gravity counteract one another. But Genesis \u2014 a Discovery-class spacecraft with a price tag of $264 million designed, built, tested and operated by Lockheed Martin \u2014 failed to deploy its parachutes due to an engineering error. The mishap was later tied to improper orientation of gravity-switch sensors that were to set off the capsule\u2019s parachute landing system. The resulting crash landing banged up the return capsule and shattered the collection wafers, corrupting the prized shipment of solar wind particles.\n\nFast forward 20 years, and scientists say they have clutched victory from the jaws of defeat. The researchers who have been meticulously cleaning and studying the fragments say they have been able to the samples to make new discoveries into the nature and impacts of solar wind that they plan to share Dec. 13 at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) being held Dec. 9 to 13 in Washington, D.C.\n\nCleaning and gleaning\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we are finally getting to the point where we are starting to do the really interesting science,\u201d said Amy Jurewicz, a Genesis project scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She is an assistant research professor at Arizona State University\u2019s Center for Meteorite Studies in Tempe, Arizona, and a chief Genesis team member working on the cleaning problem.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying to figure out how to use these itty-bitty little samples that had gotten dirty. Now we\u2019re finding some really good stuff,\u201d Jurewicz told SpaceNews. The main message today, she said, is, \u201cYes, we had an accident. It didn\u2019t go as planned. But look at what we can still do with the samples.\u201d NASA\u2019s Genesis spacecraft crashed into the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah in 2004. Credit: NASA\n\nAside from making sense of and cleaning the wreckage of the collection wafers, the process of piecing together valid scientific studies from Genesis involved comparing findings to data from other spacecraft observations, as well as data from additional instruments on Genesis \u2014 and studying the pieces with techniques and technology not yet developed when the spacecraft took off.\n\nFor one, there were a number of other instruments on Genesis, not just one big collector. Depending on how you count the busted-up solar wind collectors, there\u2019s between 5,000 and 10,000 pieces available for study, Jurewicz said, with specialists \u201cdonating their time to the cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scientific work invested in a variety of collector materials allowed for several methods to make the same elemental or isotopic measurement. The bonus is that after the crash, some of the materials were more easily cleaned than others,\u201d Judith Allton, the Genesis sample curator at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, told SpaceNews.\n\n\u201cThe payload design called for collector materials to be of a thickness unique to each solar wind regime captured. Thus, when collector pieces were dislodged and mixed together by the crash, the specific solar wind regime contained within each fragment is identified by measuring the thickness of the fragment,\u201d Allton said. \u201cThe 300 mirror-polished collectors looked so beautiful when the canister was closed in August 2000,\u201d she said, prior to the probe\u2019s sendoff a year later.\n\nThe team has also matched some Genesis findings against those of NASA\u2019s sun-observing Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft, Jurewicz told SpaceNews. Launched in 1997, ACE produces space weather reports and keeps an eye on geomagnetic storms unleashed by the sun that can interrupt telecommunication services on Earth and harm astronauts in space.\n\nHaving \u201cmore than one shot\u201d at achieving a measurement proved beneficial, said Allton.\n\nMany people working on Genesis still feel a sense of camaraderie after all these years, Allton added, \u201cI suppose due to our common focus on salvaging the science.\u201d That sense of family and making a contribution may only happen on small missions like the Discovery Program missions, she added.\n\nResults and implications\n\nGenesis was designed to provide precise knowledge of the solar system initial isotopic and chemical compositions by returning solar matter for analysis in terrestrial laboratories.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the mission is perhaps best remembered by general audiences for the crash of the sample return capsule when the parachute failed to deploy,\u201d said Genesis Mission Science Team member and University of California, Los Angeles, researcher Kevin McKeegan. \u201cHowever, despite this setback, Genesis has accomplished all its major science goals and is continuing to achieve progress on secondary and tertiary tasks.\u201d\n\nMcKeegan observed in his AGU abstract that when it comes to the composition of oxygen and nitrogen isotopes in chondrite meteorites and inner solar system materials, \u201cwe now know that the standard model is grossly wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have learned new things that have brought us to a new era of research, not just on solar wind, but space weathering and how things change due to the radiation damage,\u201d Jurewicz said. That information is useful in figuring out how the surface of the moon and asteroids are changed by solar bombardment, she added.\n\nGenesis samples are still available and remain useful to the research community. Given the cleaning alongside 20 years of advancements in scientific gear and techniques, \u201cthere is now a basis for people to look at the samples and move on from there,\u201d Jurewicz said. For instance, the work on Genesis offers the most precise solar data ever captured in space to aid cosmochemistry experts modeling solar system formation.\n\n\u201cGenesis occupied a special place in the history of robotic space exploration as the first mission to return to Earth from beyond the moon, and the first return in a series of robotic sample-return missions,\u201d said Roger Wiens, who runs the Wiens Planetary Spectroscopy Lab in Purdue University\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in West Lafayette, Indiana. \u201cThe mission will be remembered as coming from the \u2018faster, better, cheaper\u2019 era, and fortunately, its samples and science survived in spite of its low budget and its crash landing,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cevery cosmochemistry class teaches\u201d about the spacecraft\u2019s discoveries."

Almost all ALS cases have cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates, and TDP-43 mutations cause this devastating neurodegenerative disease.\n\nThe rNLS8 model is a twofold transgenic model in which human TDP-43 expression is suppressed by doxycycline (Dox) and has a faulty nuclear localization signal. The study aimed to compare the disease phenotype to the model's previously reported characterization (Walker et al., Acta Neuropathol 130, 2015).\n\nMethods\n\nAnimals:\n\nAll animal work followed the European Union Directive 2010/63 and was approved by the national Project Authorization Board. Mice lacking the tetO-hTDP-43-\u0394NLS transgene (tTA, 6F+6M) were compared to hemizygous rNLS8 double transgenic mice (rNLS8, 6F+10M; JAX ID: 028412).\n\nThe IHC analysis was performed on a separate cohort of rNLS8 (6F+5M) and tTA (4F+3M). From birth until disease induction, animals were fed ad libitum Dox-supplemented food (200 mg/kg Envigo).\n\nReadouts:\n\nClinical scores and body weights were measured thrice weekly (Figure 1).\n\nTo test wire hang, invert the top mesh of a wire cage and measure the time it takes to drop (maximum 180 seconds). If the 180-second mark was not met, up to three trials were allowed. The best attempt was chosen for analysis.\n\nAnimals were trained for five minutes at 4 RPM. One hour later, animals were subjected to three consecutive accelerating trials (0 to 40 RPM over 360 s; inter-trial interval 30 minutes).\n\nCSF was analyzed for NfL using the Quanterix SimoaTM NF-Light V2 Advantage test kit (#104073) in single determinations.\n\nTo analyze the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), gastrocnemius muscle cryosections were stained with anti-VAChT and anti-Syp antibodies and AF594-labeled \u03b1-bungarotoxin. The number of non-overlapping and overlapping pre- and post-synaptic components was investigated.\n\nFFPE slices from the lumbar spinal cord were stained with antibodies to identify total TDP-43 (human and mouse) and phosphorylated TDP-43 (Ser409/410). The Visiopharm\u00ae system was used for image analysis.\n\nFigure 1. Study design and clinical scoring criteria used in the study. For clinical scoring, animals were lifted by the tail to monitor hind limb clasping and subsequently immobilized to monitor the presence of tremor. Image Credit: Charles River Laboratories.\n\nResults\n\nClinical scores and body weights: In rNLS8 mice, hind leg weakness began seven days after discontinuing dox (Figure 2A). On day 22, all rNLS8 mice demonstrated complete hind limb clasping (score = 2). After two weeks off dox, rNLS8 mice began to lose weight (Figure 2B). Five of the 10 rNLS8 males reached the study\u2019s endpoints earlier because they lost more than 25 % of their weight. Only one female mouse and no tTA controls met HEP criteria during the study\u2019s follow-up period.\n\nFigure 2. Weakness symptoms and body weight over time.

The percentage of non-overlapping presynaptic and postsynaptic staining was 3.0% in tTA controls and 40.7 % in rNLS8 animals.\n\nFigure 5.

TDP-43 levels were also much lower in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm (Figures 6A and 6B) showing mislocalisation of this protein. Enhanced phosphorylation of the protein was observed (Figures 6C and 6D).\n\nFigure 6. A) Total TDP-43 IHC staining in the lumbar spinal cord as a ratio of nuclear vs. cytoplasmic intensity.

Neuromuscular endplate denervation was found in the gastrocnemius muscle. TDP-43 pathology was seen in the cytosolic buildup of TDP-43 and enhanced phosphorylation. All symptoms and pathologies investigated in this mouse model are also found in ALS patients, demonstrating the utility of this model for ALS drug discovery.\n\nAbout Charles River Laboratories\n\nAt Charles River, we are passionate about our role in improving the quality of people\u2019s lives.

            "article_content": "OpenAI said Monday it\u2019s releasing its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, later in the day.\n\nThe AI video-generation model works similarly to OpenAI\u2019s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E: A user types out a desired scene, and Sora will return a high-definition video clip. Sora can also generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. The Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence startup, which burst into the mainstream last year thanks to the viral popularity of ChatGPT, introduced Sora in February.\n\nIt\u2019ll debut to U.S. users as well as to \u201cmost countries internationally\u201d later today, according to OpenAI\u2019s YouTube livestream, and the company has \u201cno timeline\u201d yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries.\n\nOpenAI said users don\u2019t need to pay extra for the tool, which will be included in existing ChatGPT accounts such as Plus and Pro. Employees on the livestream and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman demonstrated features like \u201cBlend\u201d (i.e., joining two scenes together at the user\u2019s direction), as well as the option to make an AI-generated video endlessly repeat.\n\nUntil now, Sora has mainly been available to a small group of safety testers, or \u201cred-teamers,\u201d who test the model for vulnerabilities in areas such as misinformation and bias.\n\nReddit users asked OpenAI executives in October about Sora\u2019s release date, questioning whether it was being delayed \u201cdue to the amount of compute/time required for inference or due to safety.\u201d In response, OpenAI\u2019s product chief Kevin Weil wrote, \u201cNeed to perfect the model, need to get safety/impersonation/other things right, and need to scale compute!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe obviously have a big target on our back as OpenAI,\u201d Rohan Sahai, OpenAI\u2019s Sora product lead, said on the livestream, adding that the company needs to prevent illegal use of the technology. \u201cBut we also want to balance that with creative expression.\u201d\n\nOpenAI closed its latest funding round in October at a valuation of $157 billion, including the $6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and Big Tech companies. It also received a $4 billion revolving line of credit, bringing its total liquidity to more than $10 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a serious growth plan for OpenAI, as the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence startup battles Amazon-backed Anthropic, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon for the biggest slice of the generative AI market, which is predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\n\nEarlier this month, OpenAI hired its first chief marketing officer, indicating plans to spend more on marketing to grow its user base. And in October, OpenAI debuted a search feature within ChatGPT that positions it to better compete with search engines like Google, Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Perplexity and may attract more users who otherwise visited those sites to search the web.\n\nWith Sora, the ChatGPT maker is looking to compete with video-generation AI tools from companies such as Meta and Google, which announced Lumiere in January. Similar AI tools are available from other startups, such as Stability AI\u2019s Stable Video Diffusion. Amazon has also released Create with Alexa, a model that specializes in generating prompt-based short-form animated children\u2019s content.\n\nVideo could be the next frontier for generative AI now that chatbots and image generators have made their way into the consumer and business world. While the creative opportunities will excite some AI enthusiasts, the new technologies present serious misinformation concerns as major political elections occur across the globe. The number of AI-generated deepfakes created has increased 900% year over year, according to data from Clarity, a machine learning firm.\n\nOpenAI has made multimodality \u2014 the combining of text, image and video generation \u2014 a prominent goal in its effort to offer a broader suite of AI models.\n\nNews of Sora\u2019s release follows protestors\u2019 decision to leak what appeared to be a copy of Sora over concerns about the ChatGPT maker\u2019s treatment of artists.\n\nSome members of OpenAI\u2019s early access program for Sora, which it said included about 300 artists, published an open letter in late November critiquing OpenAI for not being sufficiently open or supporting the arts beyond marketing.\n\n\u201cDear corporate AI overlords,\u201d the protestors\u2019 open letter stated, \u201cWe received access to Sora with the promise to be early testers, red teamers and creative partners. However, we believe instead we are being lured into \u2018art washing\u2019 to tell the world that Sora is a useful tool for artists.\u201d\n\nThe letter added that hundreds of artists provided unpaid labor for OpenAI through bug testing and feedback on Sora, and that \u201cwhile hundreds contribute for free, a select few will be chosen through a competition to have their Sora-created films screened \u2014 offering minimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not against the use of AI technology as a tool for the arts (if we were, we probably wouldn\u2019t have been invited to this program),\u201d the open letter stated. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t agree with is how this artist program has been rolled out and how the tool is shaping up ahead of a possible public release. We are sharing this to the world in the hopes that OpenAI becomes more open, more artist friendly and supports the arts beyond PR stunts.\u201d\n\nIn late November, an OpenAI spokesperson responded to the protestors\u2019 actions in a statement to CNBC.\n\n\u201cHundreds of artists in our alpha have shaped Sora\u2019s development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards,\u201d the OpenAI spokesperson said at the time. \u201cParticipation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool. We\u2019ve been excited to offer these artists free access and will continue supporting them through grants, events, and other programs.\u201d"

It uses OpenAI\u2019s name, but says OpenAI is not an investor. Originally legally controlled by OpenAI cofounder and CEO Sam Altman, it has raised money from outside LPs, including Microsoft, a big OpenAI backer, and \u201cother OpenAI partners,\u201d according to its website. Altman gave up legal control to general partner Ian Hathaway earlier this year.\n\nVCs typically use SPVs to pool money from investors and invest outside their main fund. However, the fund is staying quiet about exactly what these funds are for.\n\nA spokesman from OpenAI told TechCrunch that this SPV \u201cwill be used to support a variety of existing portfolio companies and to make new investments.\u201d\n\n\u201cSPVs allow us to allocate capital to high-potential investments opportunistically.\u201d\n\nThe fund, founded in 2021, has been on a real SPV streak this year, disclosing five separate vehicles that now total $114.2 million:\n\nSPV I, January 2024: $10,000,000\n\nDespite the flurry of activity, its website is sparse, with its most recent news posted a year ago. The website discloses only a few of its investments, like legal AI startup Harvey and AI note taking app Mem.\n\nHowever, the fund is more active than its website indicates. Notable investments this year include include Thrive Health, an AI health venture between Sam Altman and Ariana Huffington, and warm outbound startup Unify.\n\nThe fund is also a seed investor in Anysphere, which is currently in the middle of a VC bidding war thanks to its AI code assistant Cursor.\n\nThese SPVs are all on top of the Fund\u2019s original capital of $175.25m, which was raised back in October 2021."

            "article_content": "What is Sora?\n\nSora is a powerful AI video generation model that can create videos from text prompts, animate images, or remix videos in new styles. OpenAI first previewed the model back in February, but today is the first time the company is releasing it for broader use.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about this release?\n\nThe core function of Sora\u2014creating impressive videos with simple prompts\u2014remains similar to what was previewed in February, but OpenAI worked to make the model faster and cheaper ahead of this wider release. There are a few new features, and two stand out.\n\nOne is called Storyboard. With it, you can create multiple AI-generated videos and then assemble them together on a timeline, much the way you would with conventional video editors like Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\nThe second is a feed that functions as a sort of creative gallery. Users can post their Sora-generated videos to the feed, see the prompts behind certain videos, tweak them, and generally get inspiration, OpenAI says.\n\nHow much can you do with it?\n\nYou can generate videos from text prompts, change the style of videos and change elements with a tool called Remix, and assemble multiple clips together with Storyboard. Sora also provides preset styles you can apply to your videos, like moody film noir or cardboard and papercraft, which gives a stop-motion feel. You can also trim and loop the videos that you make.\n\nWho can use it?\n\nTo generate videos with Sora, you\u2019ll need to subscribe to one of OpenAI\u2019s premium plans\u2014either ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) or ChatGPT Pro ($200 per month). Both subscriptions include access to other OpenAI products as well. Users with ChatGPT Plus can generate videos as long as five seconds with a resolution up to 720p. This plan lets you create 50 videos per month.\n\nUsers with a ChatGPT Pro subscription can generate longer, higher-resolution videos, capped at a resolution of 1080p and a duration of 20 seconds. They can also have Sora generate up to five variations of a video at once from a single prompt, making it possible to review options faster. Pro users are limited to 500 videos per month but can also create unlimited \u201crelaxed\u201d videos, which are not generated in the moment but rather queued for when site traffic is low.\n\nBoth subscription levels make it possible to create videos in three aspect ratios: vertical, horizontal, and square."

The tool can also complete a scene and extend existing videos by filling in missing frames.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRohan Sahai, Sora's product lead, said a team of about five or six engineers built the video generator in months.\n\n\"Sora is a tool,\" Joey Flynn, Sora's product designer, said. \"It allows you to be multiple places at once, try multiple ideas at once, try things that are entirely impossible before.\"\n\nOpenAI showed off the new product and its various features during a livestream Monday with CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA screenshot of Sora's \"explore\" page for browsing AI videos from the community. OpenAI\n\nSora includes an \"explore\" page, a browsable feed of videos shared by the community. OpenAI also showed the various style presets available, such as pastel symmetry, film noir, and balloon world.\n\nRelated stories\n\nTo customize videos further, there's also Storyboard, which lets users organize and edit sequences on a timeline. The feature helps pull together text prompts that Sora then builds into scenes.\n\nThe company showed off Sora's features, including Storyboard. screenshot/OpenAI\n\nIn February, OpenAI made Sora available to a limited group of creators, including designers and filmmakers, to get feedback on the model.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company said in a blog post at the time that the product \"may struggle to simulate the physics of a complex scene\" and may not understand cause and effect. It may also mix up left and right and struggle to depict events that happen over time, it added.\n\nThe tool has already made a strong impression on some in Hollywood. Tyler Perry previously put his plans for an $800 million studio expansion on hold after seeing Sora. The billionaire entertainer referred to Sora demonstrations as \"shocking\" and said AI would likely reduce the need for large sets and traveling to locations for shoots.\n\nHowever, the tool's product designer said in the demonstration Monday that Sora wasn't going to create feature films at the click of a button. Flynn said the tool was more \"an extension of the creator who's behind it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you come into Sora with the expectation that you'll just be able to click a button and generate a feature film, I think you're coming in with the wrong expectation,\" Flynn added.\n\nThe team also briefly touched on safety issues. Sahai said during the presentation that OpenAI had a \"big target\" on its back and that the team wanted to prevent illegal activity while balancing creative expression with the new product.\n\n\"We're starting a little conservative, and so if our moderation doesn't quite get it right, just give us that feedback,\" Sahai said. \"We'll be iterating.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI said Sora would roll out to the public in the US and many other countries on Monday. But Altman said it would be awhile before the tool became available in the UK and most of Europe.\n\nChatGPT Plus subscribers, who pay $20 monthly, can get up to 50 generations a month of AI videos that are five seconds long and have a 720p resolution. ChatGPT Pro users, who pay $200 a month, get unlimited generations in the slow-queue mode and 500 faster generations, Altman said in the demo. Pro users can generate up to 20-second-long videos that are 1080p resolution, without watermarks.\n\nWhile nonpaying users can't create Sora videos, they can browse Sora's explore feed, Altman said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe prominent YouTuber Marques Brownlee published what he described as the first-ever Sora review on Monday, telling his nearly 20 million subscribers that the results were both \"horrifying and inspiring.\"\n\nAfter a brief overview of Sora's strengths and weaknesses \u2014 the YouTuber said that it could make provocative videos of cosmic events in deep space and other abstractions but that it struggled with realistic depictions of physics in day-to-day life, like a man running with a football \u2014 Brownlee was frank about his concerns.\n\nMillions of people can now use Sora for basically whatever they want. And while the program has decent guardrails, one can be circumvented, he said. The little watermark that Sora adds to the bottom-right corner of its videos can be cropped out, Brownlee said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"And it's still an extremely powerful tool that directly moves us further into the era of not being able to believe anything you see online,\" he said, adding: \"This is a lot for humanity to digest right now.\""

            "article_content": "OpenAI launched its video-generating tool, Sora, on Monday. But the company\u2019s opting not to release a key feature for most users pending further testing.\n\nThe feature in question generates a video using an uploaded photo or footage of a real person as a reference. OpenAI says that it\u2019ll give a \u201csubset\u201d of Sora users access to it, but that it won\u2019t roll out the capability broadly until it has a chance to fine-tune its \u201capproach to safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ability to generate a video using an uploaded photo or video of a real person as the \u2018seed\u2019 is a vector of potential misuse that we are taking a particularly incremental approach toward to learn from early patterns of use,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a blog post. \u201cEarly feedback from artists indicate that this is a powerful creative tool they value, but given the potential for abuse, we are not initially making it available to all users.\u201d\n\nOpenAI also won\u2019t let users share generated videos containing clips or images of real people to Sora\u2019s homepage discovery feed.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have a big target on our back as OpenAI, so we want to prevent illegal activity with Sora, but we also want to balance that with creative expression,\u201d Will Peebles, a member of OpenAI\u2019s technical staff and a research lead on Sora, said during a livestream presentation earlier today. \u201cWe know that [this will be] an ongoing challenge \u2014 we might not get it perfect on day one. We\u2019re starting a little conservative, and so if our moderation doesn\u2019t quite get it right, just give us that feedback.\u201d\n\nGenerative video is a powerful tool \u2014 and a controversial one, with deepfakes and misinformation being significant concerns. According to data from ID verification service Sumsub, deepfake fraud worldwide increased by more than 10 times from 2022 to 2023.\n\nAmong other steps OpenAI says it\u2019s taking to prevent misuse, Sora has a filter to detect whether a generated video depicts someone under the age of 18. If it does, OpenAI applies a \u201cstricter threshold\u201d for moderation related to sexual, violent, or self-harm content, the company claims.\n\nAll Sora-generated videos contain metadata to show their provenance \u2014 specifically metadata that abides by the C2PA technical standard. The metadata can be removed, granted. But OpenAI\u2019s pitching it as a way for platforms that support C2PA to quickly detect whether a video originated from Sora.\n\nIn a bid to fend off copyright complaints, OpenAI also says that it\u2019s using \u201cprompt re-writing\u201d to prevent Sora from generating videos in the style of a living creator.\n\n\u201cWe have added prompt re-writes that are designed to trigger when a user attempts to generate a video in the style of a living artist,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe opted to take a conservative approach with this version of Sora as we learn more about how Sora is used by the creative community \u2026 There is a very long tradition in creativity of building off of other artists\u2019 styles, but we appreciate that some creators may have concerns.\u201d\n\nA number of artists have sued AI companies, including OpenAI, over allegedly training on their works without permission to create AI tools that regurgitate content in their unique styles. The companies, for their parts, have claimed that fair use doctrine protects them from copyright infringement claims, and that AI models don\u2019t, in fact, regurgitate.\n\nOn training, OpenAI will only say that Sora was developed using a mix of \u201cdiverse datasets,\u201d including publicly available data, proprietary data accessed through its partnerships with data vendors, and custom sets developed in-house. Early this year, ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati didn\u2019t outright deny that Sora was trained on YouTube clips, in seeming violation of the Google-owned streaming platform\u2019s usage policy.\n\nAccording to video blogger Marcus Brownlee, who got an early preview of Sora, the system can create multiple variations of video clips from a text prompt or image and edit existing videos via a Re-mix tool. A Storyboard interface lets users create sequences of videos; a Blend tool takes two videos and creates a new one that preserves elements of both; and Loop and Re-cut options allow creators to further tweak and edit their videos and scenes.\n\nSubscribers to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Pro and Plus plans get access to Sora, OpenAI\u2019s video generator, today \u2014 but only if they live in certain countries.\n\n"

Styling as well as drying your hair, the device is the ideal way to get salon-perfect hair from home. Right now, there\u2019s 15% off the Shark FlexFusion range when you buy direct from Sharkclean.com. All you have to do is use the code FUSION15 any time between now and December 31. That means you could get a Shark FlexFusion from just $280 depending on the model you choose. Sounds good, right? Let\u2019s take a look at the range.\n\nWhy you should buy a Shark FlexFusion\n\nParticularly for anyone with thick hair, buying one of the best hair dryers is a huge game changer. However, it\u2019s an even bigger deal if you combine drying with styling components. Many people love the Dyson Corrale for this role but it isn\u2019t perfect and it\u2019s much more expensive than the Shark FlexFusion. Going with Shark means you can budget for an extra gift or simply enjoy a considerable saving.\n\nOne of the best options is the with Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush. Down to $280 from $330 when you apply the code FUSION15, you get the perfect all-in-one tool for drying, curling, volumizing, smoothing, or straightening. There\u2019s no risk of heat damage from styling and you can even dry and style wet hair. It also has a scalp shield for protecting your scalp, and it\u2019s developed by dermatologists so you\u2019re all good here.\n\nWhen buying, you can choose two accessories such as a FrizzFighter, Oval Burhs, or auto-wrapper. It\u2019s perfect for personalizing your gift choice for your loved one. If you want to spend more, you can do so by investing in more accessories, or by adding on an air straightener. It\u2019s great to have such flexibility here as it feels much more like picking an individual gift for someone rather than just choosing an out-of-the-box solution.\n\nThe Shark FlexFusion range is now available with 15% off when you use the code FUSION15 at Sharkclean.com. The code works until December 31 but we think it\u2019d be great to buy now to gift to someone ahead of the holidays. Check out which bundle works best for you by tapping the link below and don\u2019t forget to apply the code!"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nFinding a reasonable hypothesis can pose a challenge when there are thousands of possibilities. This is why Dr. Joseph Sang-II Kwon is trying to make hypotheses in a generalizable and systematic manner.\n\nKwon, an associate professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, published his work on blending traditional physics-based scientific models with experimental data to accurately predict hypotheses in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering.\n\nKwon's research extends beyond the realm of traditional chemical engineering. By connecting physical laws with machine learning, his work could impact renewable energy, smart manufacturing, and health care, outlined in his recent paper, \"Adding big data into the equation.\"\n\nDeriving hypotheses for experimental observations typically involves a trial-and-error process. Kwon has developed a systematic framework that integrates specialized knowledge with experimental data to create a more efficient process.\n\n\"The most impactful aspect of this research is its ability to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexity, creating a versatile framework to solve intricate problems,\" Kwon said. \"This versatility means that the potential benefits could reach a wide range of industries and significantly impact daily life.\"\n\nThis research could lead to new drug discovery by incorporating experimental data into these models, Kwon said. This hybrid modeling approach integrates biological knowledge with data to accelerate drug predictions.\n\n\"Developing new drugs is expensive and time-consuming,\" Kwon said. \"But with more advanced models, we can accelerate the discovery and manufacturing processes. Leveraging simulations and machine learning reduces the need for costly lab experiments, saving time and speeding up the discovery of new treatments.\"\n\nHis approach combines physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven components that can adapt and correct predictions based on real-world experimental data.\n\nKwon plans to use these models as a backbone to simulate complex systems and capture underlying physical phenomena that traditional physics-based models cannot capture alone.\n\n\"This methodology allows us to continuously estimate process parameters alongside the hyperparameters of the data-driven component,\" Kwon said. \"By doing so, we ensure that the models are applicable to a wider range of conditions, making them more versatile and better suited to handle new and varied scenarios.\"\n\n\"Purely data-driven models fall short when it comes to capturing the intricacies of these systems,\" Kwon said. \"By blending the two approaches, we can improve the efficiency and reliability of industrial processes that are critical to producing everyday essentials such as energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\"\n\nMore information: Joseph Sang-Il Kwon, Adding big data into the equation, Nature Chemical Engineering (2024).

            "article_content": "Physicists have been puzzling over conflicting observational results pertaining to the accelerating expansion rate of our Universe\u2014a major discovery recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.\n\nHow many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.\n\nJust last year, researchers made a third independent measure of the Universe's expansion by tracking the behavior of a gravitationally lensed supernova, where the distortion in space-time caused by a massive object acts as a lens to magnify an object in the background. The best fits of those models all ended up slightly below the value of the Hubble Constant derived from the CMB, with the difference being within the statistical error. Values closer to those derived from measurements of other supernovae were a considerably worse fit for the data. The method was new, with considerable uncertainties, but it did provide an independent means of getting at the Hubble Constant."

Arrow Media\n\nOne of the most significant is a white marble statue of a woman adorned with a royal crown, which a leading expert believes reveals the face of Cleopatra VII, Daily News Egypt reported.\n\nMartinez, an archeologist who has been searching for the tomb for nearly 20 years, believes the statue depicts the true face of the queen, who ruled from 51 to 30 BC.\n\nHowever, other experts disagree, noting several facial features that differ from known depictions of the queen. Instead, some have suggested it portrays a princess from the Ptolemaic dynasty.\n\nThe team also found a half-length statue of a king wearing the Nemes headdress, 337 coins, many featuring Queen Cleopatra VII\u2019s image, alongside ritual pottery, oil lamps, limestone containers, bronze statues, a scarab amulet inscribed with \u201cThe justice of Ra has arisen\u201d and an array of other artifacts.\n\n4 One of the most significant finds is a white marble statue of a woman adorned with a royal crown, which a leading expert believes reveals the face of Cleopatra VII.

            "article_content": "In September 2004, NASA\u2019s Genesis return sample capsule tumbled from the sky and slammed into the Utah desert in a remote part of the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground, shattering the delicate solar wind collectors it carried. The upshot of that downfall: new scientific insights following over 20 years of painstaking work by researchers sorting through the spacecraft\u2019s contaminated remains.\n\nGenesis was loaded with delicate wafers that held precious samples of atoms and ions from puffs of solar wind that the probe accumulated while lingering at Lagrange Point 1, the spot in space where Earth\u2019s and the sun\u2019s gravity counteract one another. But Genesis \u2014 a Discovery-class spacecraft with a price tag of $264 million designed, built, tested and operated by Lockheed Martin \u2014 failed to deploy its parachutes due to an engineering error. The mishap was later tied to improper orientation of gravity-switch sensors that were to set off the capsule\u2019s parachute landing system. The resulting crash landing banged up the return capsule and shattered the collection wafers, corrupting the prized shipment of solar wind particles.\n\nFast forward 20 years, and scientists say they have clutched victory from the jaws of defeat. The researchers who have been meticulously cleaning and studying the fragments say they have been able to the samples to make new discoveries into the nature and impacts of solar wind that they plan to share Dec. 13 at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) being held Dec. 9 to 13 in Washington, D.C.\n\nCleaning and gleaning\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we are finally getting to the point where we are starting to do the really interesting science,\u201d said Amy Jurewicz, a Genesis project scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She is an assistant research professor at Arizona State University\u2019s Center for Meteorite Studies in Tempe, Arizona, and a chief Genesis team member working on the cleaning problem.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying to figure out how to use these itty-bitty little samples that had gotten dirty. Now we\u2019re finding some really good stuff,\u201d Jurewicz told SpaceNews. The main message today, she said, is, \u201cYes, we had an accident. It didn\u2019t go as planned. But look at what we can still do with the samples.\u201d NASA\u2019s Genesis spacecraft crashed into the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah in 2004. Credit: NASA\n\nAside from making sense of and cleaning the wreckage of the collection wafers, the process of piecing together valid scientific studies from Genesis involved comparing findings to data from other spacecraft observations, as well as data from additional instruments on Genesis \u2014 and studying the pieces with techniques and technology not yet developed when the spacecraft took off.\n\nFor one, there were a number of other instruments on Genesis, not just one big collector. Depending on how you count the busted-up solar wind collectors, there\u2019s between 5,000 and 10,000 pieces available for study, Jurewicz said, with specialists \u201cdonating their time to the cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scientific work invested in a variety of collector materials allowed for several methods to make the same elemental or isotopic measurement. The bonus is that after the crash, some of the materials were more easily cleaned than others,\u201d Judith Allton, the Genesis sample curator at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, told SpaceNews.\n\n\u201cThe payload design called for collector materials to be of a thickness unique to each solar wind regime captured. Thus, when collector pieces were dislodged and mixed together by the crash, the specific solar wind regime contained within each fragment is identified by measuring the thickness of the fragment,\u201d Allton said. \u201cThe 300 mirror-polished collectors looked so beautiful when the canister was closed in August 2000,\u201d she said, prior to the probe\u2019s sendoff a year later.\n\nThe team has also matched some Genesis findings against those of NASA\u2019s sun-observing Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft, Jurewicz told SpaceNews. Launched in 1997, ACE produces space weather reports and keeps an eye on geomagnetic storms unleashed by the sun that can interrupt telecommunication services on Earth and harm astronauts in space.\n\nHaving \u201cmore than one shot\u201d at achieving a measurement proved beneficial, said Allton.\n\nMany people working on Genesis still feel a sense of camaraderie after all these years, Allton added, \u201cI suppose due to our common focus on salvaging the science.\u201d That sense of family and making a contribution may only happen on small missions like the Discovery Program missions, she added.\n\nResults and implications\n\nGenesis was designed to provide precise knowledge of the solar system initial isotopic and chemical compositions by returning solar matter for analysis in terrestrial laboratories.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the mission is perhaps best remembered by general audiences for the crash of the sample return capsule when the parachute failed to deploy,\u201d said Genesis Mission Science Team member and University of California, Los Angeles, researcher Kevin McKeegan. \u201cHowever, despite this setback, Genesis has accomplished all its major science goals and is continuing to achieve progress on secondary and tertiary tasks.\u201d\n\nMcKeegan observed in his AGU abstract that when it comes to the composition of oxygen and nitrogen isotopes in chondrite meteorites and inner solar system materials, \u201cwe now know that the standard model is grossly wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have learned new things that have brought us to a new era of research, not just on solar wind, but space weathering and how things change due to the radiation damage,\u201d Jurewicz said. That information is useful in figuring out how the surface of the moon and asteroids are changed by solar bombardment, she added.\n\nGenesis samples are still available and remain useful to the research community. Given the cleaning alongside 20 years of advancements in scientific gear and techniques, \u201cthere is now a basis for people to look at the samples and move on from there,\u201d Jurewicz said. For instance, the work on Genesis offers the most precise solar data ever captured in space to aid cosmochemistry experts modeling solar system formation.\n\n\u201cGenesis occupied a special place in the history of robotic space exploration as the first mission to return to Earth from beyond the moon, and the first return in a series of robotic sample-return missions,\u201d said Roger Wiens, who runs the Wiens Planetary Spectroscopy Lab in Purdue University\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in West Lafayette, Indiana. \u201cThe mission will be remembered as coming from the \u2018faster, better, cheaper\u2019 era, and fortunately, its samples and science survived in spite of its low budget and its crash landing,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cevery cosmochemistry class teaches\u201d about the spacecraft\u2019s discoveries."

            "article_content": "One of the most astonishing facts about the natural world is the existence of antiparticles. Theorised by the English physicist Paul A.M. Dirac in 1928 and observed in cosmic rays by American physicist Carl Anderson in 1932, an antiparticle is a \u2018partner\u2019 of a particle type that has the same mass but opposite charge. For example, the antielectron is the antiparticle of the electron; it has the same mass and is positively charged.\n\nAntiparticles are an inevitable consequence of describing the world in terms of quantum mechanics and special relativity.\n\nAn antiparticle is a particle travelling backward in time. This is not an oversimplification. If it sounds eerie, that\u2019s because it is.\n\nO antimatter, where art thou?\n\nBut where is all the antimatter made of antiparticles? It is certainly scarce, or we would have discovered it a long time ago. Still, antiparticles are detectably numerous. Our own bodies make one antielectron every 20 seconds from the decay of potassium-40. Cosmic rays raining down on us supply antiprotons, antielectrons, and even antinuclei. Every proton and neutron \u2014 constituents of the nuclei that make up all the matter we can touch \u2014 is teeming with antiquarks.\n\nBut it is when we look out at the universe as a whole that antimatter\u2019s scarcity becomes clear. All galaxies are made of matter, not antimatter. Even in the infant universe, there had to have been a small dissimilarity between the populations of protons and antiprotons for our predictions about the outcomes of the synthesis of nuclei in the early universe and the features of the cosmic microwave background (radiation leftover from the Big Bang) to hold.\n\nThat is, for every 1.7 billion proton-antiproton pairs, there should have been an extra unpaired proton.\n\nSomething happened\n\nPresumably the universe started out with equal amounts of matter and antimatter before something happened to distort this symmetry. That\u2019s a good thing: otherwise matter and antimatter would have mutually annihilated to fill the universe with nothing but a fog of radiation \u2014 no raw material to make stars, planets or us.\n\nBut what spoiled the symmetry? Put differently, why is there something around us rather than nothing (but that fog)? Nobody knows for certain. What we do know is that any theory attempting to explain it must satisfy three conditions, called the Sakharov conditions. The best current theory to explain the world, the Standard Model of particle physics, falls woefully short of meeting all of them.\n\nAt least this was the lore until the authors of an August 2024 preprint paper pointed out an interesting caveat.\n\nThey showed that one of the conditions can be satisfied by the Standard Model alone, provided some new particle species helps with the process of making matter.\n\nAn unsettling discovery\n\nLook at the world in a mirror. Does it look the same? Apples would still fall and moons would circle planets because gravity would be unchanged. Protons and neutrons would cling to form nuclei because the strong nuclear force would be preserved. But atomic nuclei won\u2019t undergo radioactive fission because that happens via the weak force. And the weak force, like a vampire, vanishes in the mirror-world.\n\nThe discovery of this fact in 1957 was profoundly unsettling because it struck at cherished notions of symmetry in nature. A parity transformation (denoted P) \u2014 the act of swapping left and right \u2014 appeared to eliminate the weak force. But soon physicists found that if they replaced a particle with its antiparticle in the mirror-world, the weak force reappeared. This action is called charge conjugation (C). It seems the universe didn\u2019t conserve P and C separately but did so when they happened together. This is called CP symmetry.\n\nBut in 1964, American physicists James Cronin and Val Fitch found that even CP symmetry is violated. And it wasn\u2019t violated all the time \u2014 which made it more nagging. They found that it was violated around once for every thousand times a process involving the weak force happened in nature. Nine years later, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa in Japan found that if there were at least three variants of every quark species \u2014 with all properties the same except for the mass \u2014 CP symmetry violation is unavoidable. And all fermion particles do come in three variants, a.k.a. generations. For instance, the up quark has two other variants: the charm and top quarks.\n\n(Around the same time, physicists also found that the strong nuclear force \u2014 involved in fission and fusion \u2014 ought to violate CP symmetry strongly but doesn\u2019t. This is called the strong CP puzzle.)\n\nThe Sakharov conditions\n\nNow, as soon as CP symmetry violation was confirmed, the Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov realised it\u2019s actually an essential condition to create a matter-antimatter asymmetry in the early universe. Unfortunately, the amount of CP symmetry violation the Standard Model allowed for (the ~1 in 1,000 rate) proved insufficient to explain the magnitude of the asymmetry.\n\nThis is where the authors of the August paper have pointed out a loophole. We have known for some time that processes involving mesons \u2014 particles made of quark-antiquark pairs \u2014 violate CP symmetry, which is just how Cronin and Fitch made their discovery. Now, if a meson could decay to particles not contained in the Standard Model, the matter-antimatter asymmetry could be controlled by the product of two quantities: the amount of standard CP violation and the fraction of decays into the non-standard particles. This fraction can\u2019t be too large: otherwise we would have detected the non-standard particles in particle colliders.\n\nThe study\u2019s conceit, then, is to introduce a mechanism that ensured this fraction was large just in the early universe but evolved to a smaller number today. This can be done if the masses of the new particles vary over time, which is possible to arrange in quantum field theory.\n\nHard-won progress\n\nThis mechanism has thus brought one of the three Sakharov conditions within the reach of the Standard Model five decades since these conditions came to light.\n\nThe other two conditions are: (i) A large violation in a type of charge carried by particles, called the baryon number. For example, protons and neutrons have a baryon number of 1 and their antiparticles carry a value of -1. (ii) Interactions must occur out of thermal equilibrium, meaning that particle processes in the forward and backward directions do not occur at the same rate.\n\nWhile the Standard Model does not meet these conditions adequately, the work discussed here serves as an important step towards understanding why matter overwhelmingly dominates over antimatter in our universe today.\n\nNirmal Raj is an assistant professor of theoretical physics at the Centre for High Energy Physics in the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru."

            "article_content": "With the use of artificial intelligence, there is no recruitment solution today as efficient, complete, and fast as AI. Talent acquisition becomes further competitive because of AI-enabling recruitment tools like RecruitBPM, which are no longer options in the present recruitment landscape but have become necessity. With an increasingly sophisticated recruiting process, it helps companies to have more streamlined workflows so that the right candidate can be connected at the right time.\n\nArtificial intelligence in recruitment reached its peak in 2024. Most companies have now started believing in digital transformation; hence, AI recruiting software has become popular and is implemented on an enormous scale. This AI recruiting software enhances candidate screening with improved accuracy without any biases during the recruitment process and promotes diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe core secrets of these AI recruitment software are held within advanced algorithms which can sift through resumes, job descriptions, and even social media profiles, accurately identifying the ideal person for the job in a matter of minutes. By predictive analytics and automated candidate matching, AI recruiting tools help HR experts make fast and yet confident hiring decisions.\n\nThe more we move into the years to come, the merit and importance of AI recruiting software are coming to focus, as these tools have begun the transformation of organizations\u2019 talent acquisition and engagement processes for a more effective recruit-to-hire process. As time goes on, the prevailing trend will be for data-driven recruitment across organizations. In this advanced time, it is pretty sure that AI would keep organizations ahead of the curve by making hiring faster, smarter, and far better.\n\nThe Rise of AI in Recruitment SaaS\n\nArtificial intelligence has totally transformed the recruitment process, especially in the SaaS industry. The earlier method of recruitment used to take up a lot of time and was based on human instinct. However, AI recruiting software has changed all this. Now, it\u2019s fast and saves time because of data input. These days, through AI applications, one can search gigantic databases for perfect candidates. Using AI recruiting software saves plenty of time for the recruiter, so he gets to concentrate on more strategic decisions.\n\nIn addition, the most powerful trend in AI recruitment software is automation. These AI recruiting software are able to automatically filter through resumes for ranking based on qualification and even predict the compatibility with the culture of a company for the candidate. Organizations can save time and recruit based on objectivity and without bias.\n\nPredictive analytics is another crucial trend. The AI recruiting software can now help organizations predict their future hiring needs by looking at historical trends and market data on hiring. It allows the HR teams to be proactive instead of reactive, so they are always ready to identify talent when needed.\n\nThere is a tremendous business model evolution through which most companies have tended to settle to adopt the Subscription-Based models through Software as a Service to AI recruiting software for their business and that subscription model allows them flexibility because they change recruitment strategies without the burden of one-time, high-cost software purchases.\n\nAI recruitment software nowadays provides more integrated solutions through which holistic user experience comes about to hiring teams. These teams cut across posting job openings, sourcing candidates, tracking applicants, and managing various requisitions.\n\nAI has indeed transformed how recruitment goes in the SaaS space. It has ensured recruitment is smarter, faster, and less expensive. The face of recruitment will continue changing with AI recruiting software dominating more than ever.\n\nIndustry Trends to Watch\n\nWith AI changing the face of the recruiting environment, hundreds of other trends define the future leveraging AI recruiting tools like machine learning applications. Another trend is called Natural Language Processing, which allows technology to analyze resumes, job descriptions, and even interactions with recruiters and applicants. Gradually, software becomes so accurate that the tool tends to be even more predictive about who\u2019s going to be perfect for the seat, making it a fine hiring process as well.\n\nThe use of Natural Language Processing in resumes, job descriptions, and even in dialogue between recruiters and candidates. NLP enables AI recruiting software to understand the context in addition to the meaning in words, thus making it suitable for candidates\u2019 jobs with better accuracy. It has very much improved candidate screening as such AI tools can pick skills and experience most relevant in the absence of manual checking.\n\nAnother important advancement of AI recruiting software is in candidate screening. Traditional screening involves long hours of human review of resumes and applications, whereas modern AI recruiting software can automatically scan thousands of applications in a few seconds. These AI recruiting softwares can identify the most suitable candidates based on a combination of keywords, skills, and even patterns derived from previous hiring trends. This would fasten the process of recruitment and simultaneously ensure that more precise decisions are taken, which would be data-driven, as against the imperfections of human judgment.\n\nThese artificial intelligence trends are only evolving and setting new benchmarks with regard to the recruitment sectors. AI recruiting software is making the recruitment process efficient and effective in a manner that these artificial intelligence trends will surely hold for years in shaping their industry.\n\nMonetization Strategies for AI Recruiting Tools\n\nBusiness models for SaaS tools that support AI recruiting software change constantly. The most widely used monetization strategy is the subscription model. This model allows businesses to pay a recurring fee that depends on features and services in use and is flexible and scalable. This means there is always a steady income for the service provider; however, it allows the hiring customer to select the program that best fits the needs of hiring the best. Most AI recruiting software, including RecruitBPM, provide multilevel subscription plans as well, offering varying levels of access to premium features that include candidate matching and predictive analytics.\n\nAnother commonly used model is the freemium model. Here, AI recruiting software offers users free basic features to try out the tool before they decide to subscribe to any plan. This will attract a wide user base and help businesses gain the trust of potential clients. Once they realize the value of the AI recruiting software, they will be more than willing to upgrade to the paid version that offers the most advanced features. RecruitBPM does this by offering a free trial that prompts users to upgrade to a premium plan and provides access to rank automated candidates and advanced reports.\n\nMany companies follow pay-per-use or transactional pricing models, where a business pays according to the number of users or transactions processed in the long run. It is very attractive to smaller companies or startups that need the best AI recruiting software but do not have enough funds to subscribe fully.\n\nThus, firms with the best AI recruiting software, such as RecruitBPM, utilize flexible, scalable monetization strategies\u2014the subscription and freemium models\u2014which enable companies to be small or large yet still grow with time.\n\nTop AI Recruiting Tools for 2024\n\nArtificial intelligence is transforming the recruitment world as we speak; many innovative AI recruiting software tools are efficient, unique in features, and designed for enhancing hiring processes, rendering recruitment more quick, precise, and not biased in any way. Here are some of the first AI recruiting software expected in 2024, enumerated below, which have unique strengths and capabilities:\n\n1. RecruitBPM\n\nRecruitBPM is highly advanced AI recruiting software in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in the recruitment process. Its broad range of features, such as resume parsing, candidate matching, and automated job posting, will all be included in the solution. Thus, efficacy here is in its high, robust integration with HR\u2019s current systems, making it one nice resource for enhancing recruitment processes without damaging the integrity of the organization\u2019s current workflows. With the support of predictive analytics, it allows the selection of an applicant who best fits the needs of the job.\n\n2. HireVue\n\nHireVue improves the hiring process by video interviewing and assessment through artificial intelligence and machine learning. This AI recruiting software has artificial intelligence that evaluates the responses, facial expressions, and tone of voice of the candidates to ensure that they qualify for the job through this feature. Recruiters get candidates from any part of the world and save resources and time. Plus, with features like auto-scheduling interviews and candidate ranking, HireVue streamlines the recruitment process, making it indispensable for companies involved in mass recruitment.\n\n3. Jobvite\n\nAnother leading AI recruiting software is Jobvite. It uses AI in order to automatically screen candidates and connect with them. With an extremely customizable applicant tracking system (ATS) and job matching abilities using AI, this tool has the capability of sifting through volumes of candidate data and pinpointing who will be the best fit according to a combination of skills, experience, and cultural fit. Jobvite offers an integrated set of tools for recruiting, onboarding, and employee engagement, making it a holistic HR platform for recruitment needs.\n\n4. Pymetrics\n\nPymetrics applies the games of neuroscience and artificial intelligence to measure the cognitive and emotional aptitudes of applicants and then matches them with available openings based on an applicant\u2019s strengths. This AI recruitment software is found most popular in soft-skill industries. Pymetrics helps organizations reduce hiring bias and foster a better, more inclusive hiring strategy.\n\n5. SeekOut\n\nA hiring tool, SeekOut deploys AI to assist you in finding and engaging passive candidates. Its advanced search features using AI means that millions of profiles can be accessed in a very short span of time. Thus, organizations can reach out to passively job-seeking candidates as well. In addition, SeekOut has deep integrations with many recruiting platforms, which makes it pretty easy to use. It is especially useful for organizations that aim for diversity within their personnel as it is driven by diversity and inclusion.\n\nHow RecruitBPM Stands Out\n\nRecruitBPM stands out in the market for AI recruiting software through ease of usage and robust features with seamless integration with existing HR systems. Other competitors like RecruitCRM and Bullhorn are mainly focusing on ensuring that all components, ranging from sourcing candidates to client management, are included in this platform.\n\nOne of the biggest competitive benefits that RecruitBPM affords is that its workflow is configurable. Any company would tailor its recruiting approach so that each hiring cycle\u2019s specific needs are optimized by maximizing what one wants and needs, giving one flexibility on the very high end for a business aiming to have that solution in harmony with previously established practices rather than rigidly practiced.\n\nAnother feature is in the form of predictive analytics, whereby RecruitBPM uses artificial intelligence to analyze the data from previous hiring processes or market trends, thus allowing any human resources team to make more informed decisions about how to select candidates. Through predictive analytics, an organization can predict future hiring trends and, therefore, help the organization gain a competitive position in the talent market.\n\nMoreover, RecruitBPM\u2019s integration capabilities are more robust than most competitors\u2019. It integrates smoothly with all other human resources tools and assists companies in adopting AI recruiting software without interfering with existing workflows. Compared to RecruitCRM and Bullhorn, which may sometimes provide more complexity in integration, simplicity and efficiency give RecruitBPM an upper hand.\n\nIn conclusion, with possibilities of personalization and predictive analytics with integration that\u2019s as easy as possible, it makes RecruitBPM stand out amongst the best AI recruiting software providers thereby ranking it highly within premier software solutions tailored towards making organizational hiring better.\n\nOverlooked AI Features for Enhanced Recruiting\n\nWhile AI recruiting software is highly commended for streamlining the recruitment process, the most impactful features are often overlooked. Among the most beneficial yet underutilized features is diversity hiring predictive analytics. AI can analyze historical hiring data and make predictions about which candidates could help improve a more diversified and inclusive workforce. With such patterns found in previous hiring decisions, AI recruiting software can then suggest candidates that fulfill the required needs of a job while helping diversify teams, meaning companies will have better, more dynamic teams.\n\nOther notable features, although not often recalled, are those developed to eliminate bias. Traditional hiring does unconsciously foster bias over gender, race, and even age. AI recruiting software with a bias-detecting feature can scan for wording in job descriptions, CVs, and responses from interviews to detect instances where the wordings happen either consciously or unconsciously, so hiring decisions could rest purely on merit and appropriateness instead of biases. In addition, these features are of prime importance to any organization that strives for fair and equitable hiring practices.\n\nThese features are taking the recruitment approach to the next level with not only speed and efficiency but also fairness and long-term impact. With the constant growth of artificial intelligence, we can expect that even more of these capabilities can become integrated into recruitment to make businesses smarter and smarter about who they hire.\n\nIntegrating AI with Existing Workflows\n\nIntegrating AI with current human resource systems, including Applicant Tracking Systems, Customer Relationship Management, and Enterprise Resource Planning software, would greatly improve recruitment processes. However, proper planning and execution are necessary for seamless integration.\n\nAI tools can enhance ATS by automatically filtering candidates and suggesting AI-based recommendations for the most appropriate candidates. When used together with an ATS, AI recruiting software makes it easy to streamline candidate sourcing, improve job matching, reduce manual tasks, save time, and make better decisions.\n\nFurther integration can help recruiters converse even more efficiently with the candidates in the CRM system. AI algorithms could predict any candidate\u2019s possibility of accepting an offer put forth by a recruiter through his interactions, thereby personalizing his interactions for an even better experience in dealing with candidates. Automatically, candidate profiles can get updated with the new interaction, or resumes can update themselves from anywhere.\n\nWhile implementing artificial intelligence, aligning their recruitment activities is ensured for any ERP implementation. For example, AI recruiting software linked with the ERP of an organization makes sure hiring activities meet the organization\u2019s common objectives and targets on the company\u2019s budgetary planning as well as utilization of the company\u2019s resources. All this works by streamlining interdepartmental workflows so that recruitment would get what it requires at its proper time.\n\nThis will integrate AI with systems already in place to maximize and optimize both the AI tools and the systems already in play, producing a recruitment process that is more efficient, effective, and aligned.\n\nActionable Insights for Leveraging AI in 2024\n\nAs AI continues to evolve further into the recruitment industry, businesses must tap into the true potential of AI recruiting software. In order to get the best out of these tools, emphasis on automation, personalization, and analytics would be a means of making the hiring process smoother, better experience for the candidates, and data-driven decisions.\n\n1. Embrace Automation for Efficiency\n\nAI recruiting software is able to auto-operate, saving most recruiters much time by automating recurrent tasks like resume screening and job posting. The recruitment of the initial candidate and several other time-consuming activities are made easier by this automated system. For instance, AI recruiting software would automatically screen resumes, categorize, and match people with specific criteria to narrow down to the best possible applicants to be moved to the next level. This time allocation frees the Human Resources teams to focus more strategically on interviews as well as the building of relationships with potential candidates.\n\n2. Personalize Candidate Experience\n\nWhile automation will do most of the work, personalization is needed so that the candidate feels valued. Artificial Intelligence tools can make each candidate\u2019s recruitment process highly personalized. For instance, AI recruiting software can deliver job recommendations to the candidate, which are tailored and customized based on the candidate\u2019s employment history or profile. Furthermore, proper communication while interviewing as AI-driven chatbots will address questions the candidate raises, which will make the whole process smooth and engaging for the candidate while enhancing employer branding.\n\n3. Leverage Analytics for Data-Driven Decisions\n\nAI recruiting software is highly analytic and the data it will produce in the course of the recruitment process is crucial for the hiring process. Analyzing the earlier hiring cycles\u2019 data with AI will help find all patterns and predict what will be in the next set of hiring trends. From optimizing job descriptions that accurately predict which candidates will stand out in a given job to making decisions for hires judiciously based on facts rather than opinion.\n\nIn summary, the automation, personalization, and analytics integration in the recruitment process will make AI recruiting software usable in 2024. Collectively, these tools make the process more efficient but also provide better experiences for candidates, making it easier to attract and retain the best talent.\n\nOptimizing Candidate Experience with AI\n\nOne of the most important tools in helping with candidate experience is AI recruitment software. Among the most effective tools is AI chatbots, which respond to candidates immediately and give them responses in real-time. This chatbot can answer common questions about jobs, application statuses, and further steps. This keeps the candidate calm and relieved of any delay in the responses given to them, thus eliminating frustration and enhancing the general experience.\n\nAnother way AI-enabled tools can personalize the recruitment experience is through customizable communication. The AI recruiting software can understand a candidate\u2019s profile and preferences much better; therefore, message communication tailored to their needs makes the dialogue more relevant and interesting. It would build a better relationship with the candidates if tailored messages make them feel valued and understood. Artificial intelligence makes it possible to have a refined candidate\u2019s experience with personalized emails, customized job references, and automated follow-up which make the recruitment process less complicated and efficient.\n\nMeasuring AI ROI in Recruiting\n\nMeasurement of the return on investment will determine effectiveness: Of course, in AI recruiting software, ROI ought to be measured. Probably the way to measure success to some fair degree is KPIs like time-to-hire, cost-per-hire, and quality of hire, whereby companies could use these metrics to have judgments for whether the tools AI produces recruitment faster and possibly less cost and of superior quality.\n\nAnalytics dashboards give users access to real-time results for AI recruiting software effectiveness. In this regard, through the evaluation of candidate source, engagement, and conversion data, businesses will be aware of trends and areas that require improvement. As a result, this enables the organization to improve its recruitment process and therefore benefit more from the value added by the AI recruiting softwares, like spending much less time in hiring and increasing accuracy.\n\nChallenges and Solutions in AI Recruiting Software\n\nAI recruitment software has revolutionized the recruitment and hiring process; while in any other area, organizations must solve several barriers that stand in the way. The three major problems that arise while using AI for recruitment include data privacy, biases inherent in AI, and legacy system integration. However, again they are not unconquerable barriers, but as solutions that exist with every possibility.\n\n1. Data Privacy Concerns\n\nData privacy is a huge issue particularly in personal data: resumes, social media profiles, and interview answers. The usage of massive amounts of candidate information in AI tools requires respect for safe data handling along the lines of data protection law, which is in the case of the GDPR. Protection of data happens through safe cloud services along with encryption techniques. A system is audited from time to time for compliance.\n\nOrganizations should be transparent to candidates about their use and storage of information. Such implementations of explicit consent forms together with allowing the candidate not to participate in data collection would help increase the trust between candidates and the overall candidate experience.\n\n2. AI Bias\n\nBias is another challenge AI recruiting software can undermine effectiveness. The basis of AI tools is that they are built from historical data, and then systems can inherit biases from data and lead to inconsistant hiring decisions. This might affect diversity and inclusion as a certain number of demographics are favored more than others.\n\nCompanies should ensure that the datasets that their AI recruiting software is trained upon are diversified and updated by the changing standards of the industry over time. Most of the AI tools available in use have fairness algorithms built that identify and rectify bias at every step in the recruitment process. Human oversight has to be incorporated into the AI, so hiring decisions made by AI should be fair and not biased.\n\n3. Integration with Existing Systems\n\nOne of the major challenges is that it is not easy to integrate AI recruitment software with already prevalent Applicant Tracking Systems and Human Resource Information Systems. Therefore, as a result, organizations may struggle to fully realize the benefits of AI recruitment due to poor integration.\n\nAppropriate solution includes the selection of AI recruiting software that promise stress-free integration with the current software. Many top-rated AI recruiting software solutions such as RecruitBPM have been developed to integrate seamlessly with the existing systems; this enables organizations to automate workflows, enhance candidate screening, and generally improve efficiency without interrupting the running businesses.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe most significant tool that would assist the organization in improving its recruiting practices in 2024 under the influence of artificial intelligence would redefine methods of recruiting and selection. By optimizing a range of functions\u2014from candidate screening to job matching and interview scheduling\u2014AI recruiting software frees human resources from tactical decision-making, increasing both efficiency and fairness. Hence, it also lets you communicate directly with applicants and provides dashboards that show helpful insights into the recruitment process.\n\nRecruitBPM is one of the best AI Recruiting Software that boasts unique features in a very competitive market. Its all-inclusive and user-friendly interface is easily integrated with existing HR systems to provide effective solutions. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools from job posting to candidate engagement, plus enhances recruitment and business growth.\n\nReady to take your hiring process to the next level? Look no further than RecruitBPM. With this powerful and best AI recruiting software, the potential for improving recruitment results, attracting top talent, and maintaining a competitive advantage in 2024 and beyond is limitless.\u200b\n\nFAQs\n\nHow is AI being used in recruiting?\n\nExamples include AI in hiring, where AI-powered chatbots engage candidates and respond to queries in real time, thus improving communication and candidate experience as well. Resumes are parsed by machine learning systems, which then identify those skills and expertise that line up with job descriptions.\n\nWhat is an AI sourcing tool?\n\nSince it entirely automates the hiring process, it is a time-saving tool that helps companies. For example, AI sourcing eliminates the tedious and time-consuming nature of Boolean searches because it scans job titles, candidate resumes, job skills, and other related metrics such as time-to-hire and cost-to-hire quite quickly.\n\nWhat is the future of AI in recruitment?\n\nAI\u2019s future directions in the hiring process include efficiency improvement and elimination of bias by means of automated critical operations. Through technology, AI recruiting software utilizes natural language processing and machine learning algorithms and optimizes resume screening, candidate matching, and interview analysis. For instance, if artificial intelligence is used to automate the sourcing process, such as RecruitBPM does, it makes it possible for recruiters to quickly and easily obtain the best talent. Hence, it means a faster hiring process, but it becomes even more accurate and objective as a whole.\n\nWhat is the future of AI in HR?\n\nAI in HR will significantly affect recruitment, talent acquisition, and employee management. With artificial intelligence, organizations can automatically screen through the resumes, rank the candidates, and analyze the interview. This will, therefore, make hiring streamlined and fairer. For instance, RecruitBPM uses artificial intelligence that optimizes the recruitment workflow where candidates are given higher rates of match faster. It will also be determined that using AI-driven tools improves candidate quality, reduces hiring time by up to 40%, and, in the process, makes a better workforce."

            "article_content": "Key Takeaways Probabilistic Thinking: Though it does not come naturally, seeing the world through the lens of probability helps us achieve positive outcomes in an uncertain world.\n\nMindset Shift: Embracing probabilistic approaches allows teams to manage uncertainty and control risk, rather than relying on flawed cause-and-effect assumptions.\n\nSystem Design: Developing adaptive systems that can adjust how we work to changing conditions is more effective than creating exhaustive upfront plans.\n\nBeyond Planning: By appreciating systems, thinking in bets, and focussing on outcomes, we can move past the need for detailed plans.\n\nControlling Volatility: Leaders can use various methods to make safe bets in a controlled environment, while responding and reacting to new developments as they emerge\n\nSoftware delivery at a very large scale is extremely complex. We are not just pulling stories from a backlog in a scrum of scrums; we coordinate the collective effort of hundreds or even thousands of engineers across dozens of teams and multiple organizations to deliver a single, integrated system. These are globally distributed products and services built by the world\u2019s largest companies and provided to the most demanding customers. With so many moving parts, each requirement, team, integration, and interaction point becomes a nexus of possible failure modes. The question looms in such a complex environment: How can we turn the odds in our favor when faced with complexity so vast that failures are inevitable? Surprisingly, the answer may lie in the strategies employed in an unlikely place - Las Vegas.\n\nGames of Chance\n\nIn 1960, MIT mathematician Edward Thorp visited Las Vegas with a skeptic\u2019s eye. He noticed other players were deluded by the potential for finding betting patterns that could give them an edge on the felt. In his autobiography A Man for All Markets, he wrote, \"Mathematicians had proved no system of varying bets could blunt the casino\u2019s edge. Generations of gamblers had been seeking the impossible. Players are confused about the inevitability of losing in the long term\". This failure to grasp the mathematical futility of their pursuit reveals a fundamental human bias.\n\nThe logic of probability defies our natural intuition. We live in a world of apparent cause-and-effect relationships - touch the stove, you get burned. This daily experience of determinism and certainty shapes our thinking, creating a cognitive trap when encountering complex, probabilistic systems. We instinctively search for deterministic patterns where none exist, making incorrect associations that obscure the true statistical relationships beneath the surface.\n\nRelated Sponsored Content\n\nYet our hero Thorp was no foolish gambler. His mathematical training told him there might be a way to bend the rules - not by finding misguided patterns, but by understanding the deep structure of the underlying probability of the game. While others failed with betting systems, Thorp saw something hidden underneath Blackjack: a dynamic system where the probability landscape shifted with each card played. Armed with a crucial advantage - a computer - he began a multi-year mission to map the odds of the game. Using an IBM 704, he methodically calculated the odds for millions of card combinations, analyzing how removing each card altered the probability space.\n\nThe result was revolutionary: a system for navigating the probability curve. Thorp could track how the odds shifted between dealer and player by keeping a running count of played cards. When low cards were depleted, leaving a deck rich in high cards, the odds turned in the player\u2019s favor - signaling when to increase bets. His 1962 book Beat The Dealer revealed this system to the world, spawning the famous MIT Blackjack Team and embedding card counting in popular culture. More importantly, it demonstrated how systematic thinking about probability could transform uncertainty from an obstacle into an opportunity.\n\nPlanning in Software\n\nFast forward to today, and our world is defined by computers. In very large software delivery projects, we\u2019re tackling incredibly complex problems using vast teams, aiming to deliver high-value outcomes on a global scale. The intuition here is precisely what you would expect from us, mere humans, the same humans that misunderstand probability - we apply a system of management based on causality. With this, we fall into the trap of classical logic: the idea that we can precisely lay out a path and then follow it correctly over many months and even years. Somehow, this seems to make sense. Fictional, though it may be, the story we tell feels real.\n\nTo that end, we have tried to apply the same management systems designed for delivering real-world outcomes - factories, bridges, skyscrapers - to software. These approaches suit the physical world and its classical mechanics, trying to create predictability through determinism. They operate from the premise that work can be exhaustively described, so the focus is on centralized planning, tracking, and reporting.\n\nBut plans like these need to be correct to be successful - they make big bets on a series of events that need to succeed. And when they don\u2019t? The belief that we can press the system into submission is also supported by the conventional wisdom of determinism, which argues that we can throw people, money, and more planning at the problem to eventually emerge with something that works. Unfortunately, the premise is flawed, and the plan will continue to execute exactly as it should: into failure. Since this kind of significant up-front correctness is not something we can count on in software, we have seen these approaches consistently fail.\n\nIn software, we don\u2019t get predictability through causality. Large batches, risk-aversion, phased process, over-planning, big bang deliveries - these are the mistakes we make when we try to wrestle certainty from the hand of randomness. Rather than be like the misguided gambler, we must resist the pull of deterministic thinking.\n\nBeat the Odds\n\nJust as Thorp used probabilistic thinking and system design to beat the odds in blackjack, software development teams can improve delivery outcomes by adopting probabilistic approaches and designing adaptive systems that manage uncertainty and control volatility. With this mindset, we can move beyond traditional planning methods and develop systems that guide us through complexity and uncertainty, much like Thorp did at the blackjack table.\n\nThorpe\u2019s Blackjack system is a fantastic example of thinking in probabilities to create a system that achieves consistent outcomes in a non-deterministic way. Using a card counting system won\u2019t win you every hand, but you will consistently walk away a winner over many hours. We cannot predict what will happen throughout the play; no chart shows when the winning starts and the losing stops. Instead, the player focuses on the system, using it to read the table, adapting the play to the changing odds, and creating the circumstances for long-term success within persistent uncertainty. As long as the player is using the system correctly and doesn\u2019t get distracted by everything happening around them, they will achieve success.\n\nWhat Thorpe managed to do is control volatility over time. In probability theory, volatility is the amount of variance we see in a system over time. The more volatile a system is, the more extensive the range of outcomes we expect. By reducing bets when the odds are bad and increasing them when the odds are good, card counting uses a boundary condition on the probability curve to detect when volatility increases and when it reduces. In other words, we restrict our actions when we are in the danger zone and open them up when the surface area of positive outcomes increases. This idea that volatility is a fixed system element and that we are merely subject to its whims is perhaps a common intellectual fallacy. With card counting, Thorp found a way to play with the risk curve and capitalize on its changes over time. And so can we.\n\nBeat the Plan\n\nIn enterprise software delivery, we, too, are trying to win a long series of bets. We play from a deck of visions, missions, roadmaps, priorities, and many small decisions as we try to harness the potential of an uncertain world. Thorp faced the volatility of card distributions and used a statistical system to gain an edge. Likewise, in software, we face volatility in project requirements, implementation details, customer expectations, and market directions, but just as Thorpe used his card counting system, we can use our systems to navigate the uncertainty.\n\nWe create systems to guide us through a series of events over a long period, allowing us to exceed the limitations in our ability to plan work. To do better than a plan - to beat the plan - we need systems. Where plans might fail us, systems can save us. How might we use thinking in probabilities to design better systems? I see three key areas:\n\nWe need to have an appreciation for systems, a phrase I am borrowing from W. Edwards Deming\u2019s System of Profound Knowledge. Effective systems will protect us from the probability of failures. It is our systems that give us the edge. Systems like quality frameworks, continuous integration, deployment pipelines, and monitoring systems guide our decision-making. They are designed to enable us to make decisions safely while providing feedback to help us understand our risk and adjust accordingly. We want to elevate our perspective by looking at the network of components that work together, considering the relationships and interactions between different parts of a system and other systems and external factors. This is where probabilistic thinking becomes effective.\n\nThe next idea is to embrace a concept explored by former World Series poker player Annie Duke in her book Thinking in Bets. She defines a bet as a \"decision about an uncertain future\", and what\u2019s crucial to understand is that correct decisions don\u2019t guarantee a result. Every poker player knows the \"bad beat\", where a well-played hand loses due to sheer luck. To that end, Annie notes that the world\u2019s greatest poker players spend an unusual amount of time analyzing their decision-making process to understand whether they correctly applied their system, regardless of whether they win or lose. This wisdom is incredibly poignant to us in software, where we first need to view our decisions as bets and, second, place more value on reflecting on how we place them. We leave many parts of our work as tacit knowledge and only do retrospectives at a system level when things go wrong. We can build more resilient organizations by surfacing implicit systems and regularly examining how well we follow them rather than just reacting to successes and failures.\n\nOver time, what matters isn\u2019t individual decisions but our ability to achieve successful outcomes through consistent system-following behavior. Just as the card sharp doesn\u2019t need to win every hand to walk away ahead, a well-designed software delivery system should absorb the impact of failed experiments and wrong turns while keeping us moving toward our goals. Individual decisions - whether to refactor a service, which technology to adopt, how to structure a team, or which feature to build - may be right or wrong, but the wisdom of probability tells us the cumulative outcome matters. This is why the above two points are crucial: they help us understand whether we succeeded or failed and whether our systems are effectively guiding us toward desired outcomes despite inevitable setbacks. By setting our targets on outcomes rather than individual decisions, we create space for controlled experimentation and learning, allowing our systems to evolve and improve even as they keep us on track.\n\nThese three principles - systems thinking, betting mindset, and outcomes focus - reframe how we should approach planning in software delivery. Rather than creating perfect plans, we need to build systems that can guide us through uncertainty. A plan may tell us where we want to go, but our systems determine whether we\u2019ll get there. This brings us to the crucial question: How do we design systems that can navigate the complexities of large-scale software delivery while managing the inevitable volatility we\u2019ll encounter along the way?\n\nPlan the System\n\nWe can transform software delivery uncertainty into predictable outcomes just as Thorp transformed gambling uncertainty into a calculable advantage. But where Thorp dealt with the relatively constrained world of card probabilities, we face a far more complex challenge. Our deck contains countless variables with hidden interactions and long histories that come together and fall apart in different ways. Team dynamics, technical dependencies, market changes, customer needs, and organizational issues all interact and influence each other in ways that frustrate traditional planning methods. How might we leverage systems of software delivery to control this volatility?\n\nThe key lies in establishing boundaries that control volatility while maintaining the flexibility to adapt. Through years of experience and evolution, I\u2019ve identified five critical elements that work together to create such systems:\n\nAgility - decoupling predictability from causality\n\nContinuous Methods - using continuous methods to solve discrete problems\n\nPrioritization - working on areas with the highest volatility first\n\nConstraints - imposing enabling restrictions and limitations\n\nCulture - promoting healthy values and behaviors\n\nAll of these come together to help us design and execute systems that manage our bets and drive us toward targeted outcomes. Let\u2019s dig into each area.\n\n1. Agility - The first thing we need to do is decouple predictability from causality. We can achieve predictable outcomes without knowing all the details, creating paths that do not create much risk. Where Thorp managed the volatility of his game by adjusting bets according to his card counting system, in software development, we can manage project volatility by working in short cycles and adjusting in light of what our systems of work are telling us. We use these systems to take our \"count\", take it more often, assess our situation, and make small bets that succeed or fail without creating excessive risk. For example, we can reallocate resources to high-priority or high-risk areas as the project evolves or adjust requirements based on our learning. Agile, DevOps, and Lean methodologies form a system that gives us a regular \"read\" of the table, one we use to recalibrate where needed to land inside the range of desired outcomes eventually, which is why they are so effective for us. With this in mind, you don\u2019t need to cargo cult (imitation without understanding) practices into your organization - you can evaluate them in this light.\n\n2. Continuous Methods - The third element is continuous practices. We reduce the risk of our short-term decisions by situating them in systems of overarching engineering practices. This is the domain of Lean, where we convert discrete events into continuous practices so that each bet is placed under the same conditions. TDD, CI/CD, DevOps, DevSecOps, Automated Governance, etc. Just as Thorpe updated his card count with every hand, we run our own operations with every iteration, perhaps with every code commit, ensuring that playing a hand does not change our risk assessment equation. If we allow failing tests, security issues, defects, and the like to build up, we will no longer play our hands under the same conditions. With creative thinking, we can find ways to convert all discrete elements of software delivery into continuous functions in our engineering systems.\n\n3. Prioritization - Next, how can we get an \"unfair\" advantage in our work? By stacking the deck! This is one area where we diverge from the gambler - we get to cheat. We can choose how we structure, scope, and sequence our work to create the least amount of risk for ourselves, prioritizing the work according to where the most volatility lies. For example, integrations always present a high degree of risk, but if we focus on them first, we can continuously integrate subsystem changes throughout the delivery process. This means we get to play the game knowing that the bad cards have already been dealt! Further, prioritization should be implemented as a continuous system, not as a big upfront plan. As we progress through our work, we gain insight into whether the rest of the deck is stacked for or against us and continuously re-evaluate our position. To achieve this, we need to involve the experts closest to the problem in the feedback loops of our work delivery systems. Having a generic, common-sense understanding of how the world works is not enough. We need the representation of technical experts with deep knowledge to guide difficult decisions and develop creative solutions that achieve an optimal balance of risk and reward.\n\n4. Constraints - The fourth element is the role of constraints, as in when and how to apply constraints to achieve better outcomes from the system. This differs from classical/deterministic systems, where the constraints are imposed upon the system from outside (the cost of materials, the laws of physics, etc.), and the system operates against them. In synthetic/non-deterministic systems, constraints are imposed; they are system elements we can experiment with, adding and removing as we evolve to get the right mixture of velocity and quality. We deliberately introduce helpful governing and enabling constraints into the system to contend with volatility. In Blackjack, Thorpe had only a few quantitatively defined boundary conditions to guide his system, but in software organizations, we have a wide variety of these boundaries with which to play. For example, we can introduce technical constraints, scheduling constraints, organizational constraints, resourcing constraints, and more. We can use these to create forces that will shape the direction of our work, implementing them in a wide variety of ways with various degrees of strictness.\n\n5. Culture - Finally, we have the values and behaviors that form our culture. Thorpe\u2019s card-counting system requires commitment, focus, and discipline to succeed. In the same way, we need cultural norms that will shape and guide participants\u2019 behavior in our systems. To compensate for the uncertainty and knowledge gaps from building complex distributed systems, we must promote values like learning, transparency, citizenship, and shared responsibility. And for us, like Thorpe, we need the discipline and commitment to follow the systems we put in place. A key goal is to motivate people to make decisions that are best for the overall system, not for themselves, because it is, in fact, the system that brings people success.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe logic of probability is not readily forthcoming - our intuition does not give up on what we know well: a world of cause-and-effect relationships, reproducible and mechanical, in which one thing always leads to another. Touch the stove, and you get burned. The conditioning of classical logic in our daily lives creates a trap when we move into the world of probabilities. We are prone to making incorrect associations and false inferences that betray the underlying statistical relationships.\n\nThe journey from the casino floors of Las Vegas to the server rooms of Silicon Valley may seem a long one, but the underlying principles remain the same. Thorp showed us that by understanding volatility and designing systems to manage it, we can consistently win in a game designed for us to lose. By learning to \"count cards\" in our field - to read the shifting probabilities and adjust our strategies accordingly - we can turn the tables in our favor.\n\nThe key to mastering software development at scale lies not in our ability to predict the future but in our capacity to play with uncertainty. When we embrace the probabilistic nature of our work, we can unlock levels of efficiency and predictability that have eluded us. The question that concerns us is not how to make better plans but how to design systems that beat the plan, thrive, and even capitalize on uncertainty. This mindset shift will be one of the most crucial skills in the fascinating endeavor of large-scale software delivery."

            "article_content": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAdvancements in AI have revolutionized many industries, from healthcare and education to finance and entertainment, offering unparalleled efficiency, precision, and the ability to handle complex tasks at a scale previously unimaginable.\n\nOn the positive side, AI can streamline operations, improve decision-making, and even solve pressing global issues like climate change by analyzing large datasets. However, these advancements also come with significant risks. The rapid growth of AI technology has raised concerns about privacy, job displacement, and the potential misuse of AI systems in surveillance and defense.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Probably Missed and Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Push into Defense Raises Concerns Among Employees\n\nOpenAI is teaming up with Anduril Industries to enhance anti-drone systems using its AI technology, as per Bloomberg. This partnership aims to improve the detection and response to unmanned aerial threats. OpenAI is also expanding its role in the defense sector, including collaborations with the U.S. Air Force and hiring former Pentagon officials. The deal reflects the growing U.S.-China competition in military AI development, with Anduril seeing it as vital for addressing global air defense gaps. The partnership also signals increasing AI involvement in defense, following similar moves by other tech companies.\n\nHowever, OpenAI employees have raised concerns about the company\u2019s partnership with Anduril Industries, seeking more transparency from leadership. Internal messages viewed by The Washington Post revealed worries that the AI technology could be used beyond defensive applications against drone attacks, potentially targeting human-piloted aircraft or being deployed for other military purposes. Some employees expressed discomfort with collaborating with a weapons manufacturer, fearing damage to OpenAI\u2019s reputation. Others noted that even defensive uses of AI could contribute to its militarization, drawing parallels to the fictional Skynet system from The Terminator, which was originally designed for defense.\n\nApart from OpenAI, there are several other startups that are working in the military and defense sectors. One of them includes DEFCON AI, a company focused on next-generation modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A) for military logistics. The company focuses on creating efficient, reliable systems that help address disruptions in logistics and supply chains, ensuring timely delivery of personnel, equipment, and cargo during critical situations.\n\nIts approach combines AI-driven intelligent agents and advanced modeling to help leaders test and prepare for contested logistics scenarios. In August, DEFCON raised $44 million in seed funding. The round was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Fifth Growth Fund and Red Cell Partners. With its strong leadership team, including retired military officials, the company is set to address the growing need for intelligent military technology in the face of increasing global competition.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 235\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) integrates AI into its products, enhancing user experiences across apps like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, and also has its own language models. Its Reality Labs segment uses AI for advancements in augmented and virtual reality, supporting immersive connectivity and innovation.\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) unveiled Llama 3.3, its newest large language model on December 6. Llama 3.3 is a multilingual large language model with 70 billion parameters, designed for text-based input and output. It is optimized for multilingual dialogue and outperforms several other models in industry benchmarks. The model uses an auto-regressive architecture with Grouped-Query Attention for better scalability. It is fine-tuned using supervised learning and reinforcement learning with human feedback to enhance safety and usefulness. Llama 3.3 supports languages such as English, Spanish, German, and Hindi, among others.\n\nMeta\u2019s Gen AI VP, Ahmad Al-Dahle posted the following on X:\n\n\u201cIntroducing Llama 3.3 \u2013 a new 70B model that delivers the performance of our 405B model but is easier & more cost-efficient to run. By leveraging the latest advancements in post-training techniques including online preference optimization, this model improves core performance at a significantly lower cost, making it even more accessible to the entire open source community.\u201d\n\nOverall, META ranks 2nd on our list of trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "article_content": "Syria's long-running civil war came to a head Sunday when opposition forces entered the capital city of Damascus and the government of President Bashar al-Assad collapsed. Russian state media later reported that Assad and his family had fled to Moscow.\n\nCrowds gathered in Damascus to celebrate the fall of Assad's government with chants, prayers and occasional gunfire, marking the end of a regime that, between the ousted president and his father, had ruled over Syria for half of a century.\n\n\"At long last, the Assad regime has fallen,\" President Biden said Sunday afternoon at the White House after convening his national security team to discuss the developments. He said the fall of Assad presented an \"historic moment of opportunity,\" and pledged support for Syria and its neighbors against any threats.\n\nLocal residents gather on a street in the Damascus suburb of Jaramana on Dec. 8, 2024, after Syrian rebels said that President Bashar Assad had fled the country. LOUAI BESHARA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSyrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said early Sunday that he'd remained in Damascus and the government was ready to \"extend its hand\" to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government, The Associated Press reported.\n\nWhat happened in Syria's civil war?\n\nThe war in Syria began in 2011 when a pro-democracy uprising calling for the end of Assad's long reign escalated quickly into a brutal civil war. Since then, the conflict has claimed more than 500,000 lives and displaced some 12 million people from their homes across the country.\n\nAfter a decade of brutal conflict, the war largely stalled after the Assad regime regained control over many major cities \u2014 with vital support from Russia and Iran, in addition to the powerful Iranian proxy group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Some northern and eastern areas of the country remained under the control of Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed rebel groups.\n\nBut in late November, rebel forces in the northwest launched a shock offensive, led largely by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Shams (HTS). HTS has tried for a number of years to publicly distance itself from its jihadist roots as a regional branch of al Qaeda. With other conflicts currently occupying Assad's backers Iran, Russia and Hezbollah, the rebel forces are believed to have seen an opportunity to renew their fight against his army.\n\nThe leader of HTS told CNN in a recent interview that the goal of the offensive was to remove Assad from power.\n\n\"When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime,\" Abu Mohammad al-Golani told CNN. \"The seeds of the regime's defeat have always been within it\u2026 the Iranians attempted to revive the regime, buying it time, and later the Russians also tried to prop it up. But the truth remains: this regime is dead.\"\n\nHow was the Assad regime toppled so quickly?\n\n\"Clearly HTS's military and political skills, honed over four years in rebel-held Idlib since the last ceasefire, have been a major factor in their successes. But the weakness of Assad's forces has been the other side of the story,\" Christopher Phillips, an associate fellow with the Chatham's House think tank's Middle East program, said in an analysis.\n\nPhillips said international factors played a significant role in Assad's inability to maintain power, including Assad's closest allies being weakened or otherwise occupied, but he said there were also a number of important domestic factors.\n\n\"Assad has been complacent. His military has melted away because it is deeply demoralized. Assad has focused on winning international recognition rather than consolidating his 'victory' in the civil war at home,\" Phillips said. \"There has been no peace dividend for those who stayed loyal during the war, or for those former rebel areas that opted to reconcile rather than fight the regime. Instead, regime corruption and continuing sanctions, not to mention the regime's characteristic brutality, has meant life for Syrians living under Assad has been grim. In retrospect, it is unsurprising then that, after HTS' advances in the north, former rebellious parts of Homs, the Houran and Damascus rejoined the rebel cause this week, ultimately hastening the regime's collapse.\"\n\nU.S. and Israel carry out strikes in Syria\n\nThe United States has around 900 soldiers on the ground in Syria. The U.S. forces have operated in the country for years as part of the American effort to support the Kurdish-led forces, and to combat the ISIS extremists who seized control of a huge part of Syria and neigboring Iraq in the years after the war began.\n\nThe U.S. said it carried out airstrikes against ISIS operatives and camps on Sunday, hitting 75 targets.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told journalists during a visit to Japan on Sunday that as the situation in Syria unfolds, \"there's a potential that elements in the area, such as ISIS, to try to take advantage of this, this opportunity, and regain capability.\"\n\nAustin said the U.S. was \"still evaluating the results\" of the strikes but that he believed they were successful in the goal \"to keep the pressure on ISIS and to deny them the ability to easily resurge.\"\n\nIsrael also carried out airstrikes Sunday in Syria, hitting sites linked to Syrian state forces and Iran, the Reuters news agency reported. Israel has moved tanks into a demilitarized zone along the country's border with Syria, but the Israeli military said it intended to remain out of any conflict there, calling the move a bid to prevent any possible spill-over of fighting into Israel, according to Reuters.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Meanwhile, rising operational costs in Vietnam is also proving to be a concern. These challenges could drive global retailers to increasingly turn to India as a reliable alternative.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe report highlights that India\u2019s market share in apparel exports to the US and UK has grown steadily, reaching 7 percent and 6 percent, respectively, in 2024, up from 6 percent and 5 percent in 2023.\n\nBetter demand, Better margins\n\n\n\nIndian players like Gokaldas Exports and Indocount expect relatively better demand in 2H compared to 1H due to a possible renewed appetite for buying from retailers on the back of the festival season and now that the global inventory de-stocking cycle has now come to an end, according to the report.\n\nThe elevated freight costs due to peak season shipments and the Red Sea issue are expected to cool off in the coming months, which will aid margins for Indian players.\n\nThe recently signed UK-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA), could also be beneficial to Indian exporters.\n\nIn the US, India\u2019s market share in cotton sheet imports rose to 61 percent in 2024, up from 59 percent last year, despite a slight dip in September and challenges like the Red Sea crisis, and supply chain and logistics issues. Overall, US retailers are seeing a mixed demand sentiment. For example, Walmart raised its full-year revenue guidance to 4.8 percent-5.1 percent. On the other hand, competitors like Nike and Target faced softer consumer demand.\n\nAnother benefit to Indian textile manufacturers could be the stabilising of prices. According to the report, earlier in 2024, cotton and yarn prices peaked due to supply chain disruptions, higher demand, or market uncertainties. However, by November 2024, prices normalized, with cotton priced at Rs 151 per kg and yarn at Rs 232 per kg. The report notes that the spread between Indian and Chinese cotton prices has also narrowed significantly.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nMixed trends for global retailers\n\nAccording to the report, global retailers reported mixed inventory trends during their latest earnings calls. Walmart on the back of strong Q3 2024 results, raised its full-year revenue guidance to 4.8%-5.1% from 3.75%-4.75%. While Target and Nike expect continued demand softness, TJX remains optimistic about home textiles. Overall, the report sees that global demand is expected to see a slight boost driven by the ongoing holiday season.\n\nBoost for Indian stocks\n\nIndian textile stocks have been gaining on the back of expected growth in demand. On December 9, stocks of Gokaldas, Trident, Indo Count and Welspun gained nearly 14 percent through the day with Gokaldas closing 6 percent higher, Trident closing 10 percent higher, Indo Count closing nearly 15 percent higher and Welspun closing 5 percent higher at the end of trading for the day.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

            "article_content": "The economy in rural America starts and stops with the American farmer.\n\nAmid the deafening noise inside political echo chambers and ceaseless squabbling of Congress is one truth that we cannot ignore- we are a nation united in reliance on our farmers.\n\nWithout the American farmer, there is no adequate tax base for our school systems, local municipalities, or any services that rural Americans need to live and prosper in this country.\n\nEverybody eats, and we all need the food and fiber that our farmers produce to live. No one wants to be dependent on foreign sources of food, just like no one wants to be dependent on foreign sources of energy. Right now, our farmers need our help.\n\nHurricane Helene caused a devastating blow to Georgia's No. 1 industry, with over $6.4 billion in agricultural economic loss alone.\n\nIf we fail to provide agriculture-specific appropriations to help our farmers before the end of the year, we will see widespread, lasting economic loss across all of rural southeast America, especially in Georgia.\n\nAs I traveled across Georgia's 8th Congressional District in the immediate aftermath of Helene, I saw the devastation to our farms firsthand. From hundreds of demolished poultry houses and cotton fields in Coffee County to decimated pecan orchards in Berrien and Lowndes counties and vegetable rows and fruit bushes in ruins across Clinch County, it is clear that our farmers need immediate assistance.\n\nCongress cannot stop a hurricane, but we can fix the unnatural disasters that our farmers face to aid their recovery.\n\nHouse Agriculture Chairman Glenn \"GT\" Thompson, R-Pa., Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., visited Georgia's 8th District with me recently to survey the damage after Helene across south Georgia and north Florida. Our farmers need help, and I appreciate the chairman and others taking the time to meet with them firsthand so we can better work together for relief.\n\nUnfortunately, trouble for our nation's farmers began far before Hurricane Helene. Since the last farm bill was passed in 2018, our farmers and nation have experienced excessively challenging events that have changed the political landscape in which we need to navigate to properly support the best stewards of our land.\n\nRelated Articles Opinion: The dire state of the American farm economy\n\nWith rising input costs, including the increased cost of labor, diesel, fertilizer, chemicals, and seed, farming is more expensive than it has ever been in our country.\n\nGeorgia's farmers were also horribly impacted by Hurricane Michael in 2018, which caused more than $2.5 billion in losses to the state's agriculture industry. It took approximately 24 months for our farmers to get relief after Hurricane Michael, and I can assure you that the majority of producers and rural communities that Helene hit cannot survive another 24 months without something being done.\n\nAmerica's farmers are also suffering from the unnaturally disastrous policies of the Biden-Harris administration, which have contributed to record inflation and the rising cost of energy and food production.\n\nThere has to be a strong safety net to keep good farmers farming through bad years like this one. If you are an American who eats, you should deeply care about the passage of a comprehensive farm bill that prioritizes production agriculture.\n\nEarlier this year, the House Agriculture Committee passed the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 (the farm bill). This legislation includes critical updates to reference prices and several of my priorities to ensure a strong farm safety net by expanding crop insurance options to specialty crops, all of which would greatly assist producers in times of natural disaster.\n\nHowever, this bill is stalled in Congress, and the Senate Democrats just released a half-baked last-minute \"farm bill\" just to look like they did something, further fueling the fear of the forgotten farmer as they struggle to feed us.\n\nWhen the American farmer stops farming, rural communities collapse because their core and main economic driver is gone. We need to give farmers the support they need to keep farming with the confidence to know they are not forgotten.\n\nIt is my hope that Congress passes both the Farm, Food, and National Security Act and an agriculture-specific disaster relief appropriations package before the end of the year so that our farmers can continue feeding our nation and supporting our rural communities.\n\nRepublican Rep. Austin Scott represents the 8th District of Georgia and is a member of the House Agriculture Committee."

From the sound of their fury, they could be there for a long while. (Thoughts and prayers.)\n\nWith Democrats now irrelevant, the second Trump administration has four years to take a wrecking ball to the Washington establishment, including deep cuts to federal spending and an overhaul of the bloated bureaucracy.\n\nTo understand why the wrecking ball is needed, look at the annual budget deficit \u2212 $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. In a time of relative peace and prosperity, the deficit grew 8% in one year, even though federal revenue increased by 11%. In other words, the Biden-Harris administration collected significantly more money from taxpayers in the last fiscal year but still managed to blow up the deficit by an additional $138 billion. That's simply unsustainable.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter President-elect Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMusk operates at another level, building the most valuable automaker in the world in Tesla and the most important entity (public or private) in space travel and satellite communications with SpaceX.\n\nCan Musk succeed where Obama's Simpson-Bowles failed?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump joins SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to view the launching of the aerospace company's Starship rocket on Nov. 19, 2024, in Brownsville, Texas.\n\nIf Musk and Ramaswamy are able to accomplish even a portion of what they envision \u2212 cutting $2 trillion in government spending \u2012 it could provide a remarkable boost for our economy.\n\n\"They're going to need inside Washington budget experts like ex-Capitol Hill staffers and the like,\" Chris Edwards, a Cato Institute economist who specializes in government spending, told me. \"People (who) used to be on the budget committees on Capitol Hill and used to work for the (Office of Management and Budget). They're going to need those sorts of people to tell them exactly how and what they can cut.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn't the first attempt to cut government spending. In 2010, President Barack Obama created the Simpson-Bowles commission to recommend budget cuts that would trim the deficit over a 10-year period.\n\nThe commission's recommendations failed to gain traction in Congress. In fact, the federal government has added about $16 trillion to the national debt since Simpson-Bowles was created. So there's reason for cynicism. Trump and Congress will need to actually cut the programs Musk and Ramaswamy recommend, even if the president needs to use his veto power to do it.\n\nOpinion: Trump can fix what Biden broke. But he needs to seize the moment and stay on task.\n\nEdwards said Republicans need to be serious about deficit reduction starting next year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"(Republicans) need to at least show deficits kind of on a downward path,\" the Cato economist told me. \"They don't have to do a massive spending cut next year, but they've got to show financial markets and the Federal Reserve that the deficits are on a downward path.\"\n\nIt's a misconception that the executive branch doesn't play an important role in how the economy functions. The massive federal deficit helps fuel inflation. And as Edwards noted, \"The deficits and debt are so large now we're in uncharted financial territory for this country.\"\n\nDOGE should cut this department first\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy endorses former President Donald Trump's reelection campaign in Atkinson, N.H., on Jan. 16, 2024.\n\nThe Cato economist said DOGE could start to deliver better efficiency by initially focusing on a popular but underperforming section of the budget. A proposal to target federal spending on K-12 education might seem radical, but it also would signal that Musk and Ramaswamy are serious.\n\n\"K-12 schools is easily the biggest and most attractive opportunity for Trump and his team to cut,\" Edwards said. \"George W. Bush made a big show of signing the No Child Left Behind legislation ... and greatly increased federal subsidies and federal intrusion into the schools. That obviously failed. Test scores are down. I think today's Republican Party has completely changed on education. ... There's been the huge success of school choice.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpinion: Voters strongly rebuke Democrats by electing Trump. But will progressives listen?\n\nI second Edwards' suggestion.\n\nWhile public schools are necessary, more and more spending hasn't led to better results.\n\nThe Department of Education's budget for this fiscal year is almost $80 billion \u2012 nearly $10 billion more than the enacted budget only five years ago.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

Michel published an article that recommended $4.8 trillion in specific cuts over the next 10 years, including selling off Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and transforming Medicaid funding by sending block grants to the states.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDemocrats are sure to whine about those ideas and others. Republicans should ignore them and focus instead on saving taxpayers' money, getting the deficit under control and saving America from an economic disaster that will hit if the nation stays on its current course.\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY.

            "article_content": "Personal computers (PC) manufacturer Lenovo in the next two quarters, will have its PC plant in Puducherry manufacture GPU-based servers that will also serve as an export base for the company, said Shailendra Katyal, MD, Lenovo in an interview with ET.100% of Motorola phones, a Lenovo subsidiary, is already made in India through Dixon, its EMS partner. It exports 1.5 million phones to markets like North America. \"The forecast for manufacturing in India next year is pushing $3.5 billion,\" Katyal said, adding that around $1.5 billion worth of hardware will be exported.Lenovo's Bengaluru lab is also one of the four facilities of the company in the world for server innovation. The lab also works on hardware, software and firmware. After HP, Lenovo is number two in the PC/tablets market in India, and is also in the third position in the servers/storage market.The company launched the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 PC powered by AMD Ryzen AI Pro series processors on Monday. \"We have invested almost $200 million across 150 independent software vendors and we're helping them develop AI use cases. Fifty of them are in the Asia Pacific region and in Bengaluru. Access to these resources is available,\" he said.\"We are pushing $65 billion to $70 billion as a company with one of the most complex supply chains. There are a lot of active use cases of AI available internally. We have a tool in marketing called Studio AI where we can churn content. What used to take a few lakhs of rupees and a few days to generate, now is available in a shorter time. Our legal teams also use AI for complex tasks like cross-referring cases, and complex contracting work that we do,\" Katyal said.The company has a large B2C business through Lenovo.com. \"100% of India's revenue, on the PC side, now happens through dot com,\" he said.The Indian government is likely to consider asking all electronics companies to reduce the overall import of laptops, tablets, all-in-one personal computers, ultra-small form factor computers, and servers by 5% of their total import bill, ET had reported on November 12.Katyal said this is a fair policy and that it will encourage localisation of manufacturing. \"There is some debate on the baseline on whether it should be last year or whether it should be an average of the past three years. Industry is trying to get aligned on this. We manufacture $3.5 billion worth of hardware and export $1.5 billion worth of made-in-India hardware,\" he said.\"There was some uncertainty which is why the industry got jittery. We have a MeitY stakeholder meeting coming up this week as well. It is in the right direction of enabling the local ecosystem to thrive,\" he said. Some of the industry leaders are voicing their concern because last year import curbs were announced and then withdrawn. This year also the licence period got over in September and then got extended by three months.\"Uncertainty is what no business leader would like. As long as things are certain, there is some reaction time and time to plan for it,\" he said.He also said that the talk about production linked incentive scheme 3.0 was more progressive. \"It first encouraged assembly and manufacturing to happen out of India, and now sourcing will happen out of India which is a good incentive for other parts of the supply chain to set up shop in the country,\" Katyal said."

            "article_content": "After the Black Friday offers from many companies, two of the most popular current PC processors are hardly available or very expensive at German hardware retailers. There are hardly any reasonable offers for both AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K. All of the following information refers to the boxed versions of the processors, for which the manufacturers also provide a warranty, not the freely traded tray goods intended for PC manufacturers.\n\nAnzeige\n\nThe X3D in particular, currently the fastest CPU for games, has been in short supply for some time, but is currently virtually sold out. If a retailer promises to be able to deliver it in a few days, prices start at around 750 euros (ab 627,90 \u20ac), which is over 200 euros more than the processor cost at market launch. AMD's recommended retail price is 529 euros, which is already significantly more than its predecessor, the 7800X3D, when it was launched. This is also currently far too expensive with prices starting at around 550 euros (ab 499,90 \u20ac). In summer 2024, it was still around 330 euros.\n\nSome retailers have not even listed the 9800X3D in recent days, which means it no longer appears in price comparison services. Some retailers are now offering the processor again, but only for pre-order with rough delivery dates in December or January. An example of such an offer can be found at Mindfactory, which at the time of writing is asking 559 euros and promises an expected delivery at the end of December.\n\n285K only available immediately for more than at market launch\n\nThe supply situation for Intel's 285K is only slightly better. Although it is often inferior to cheaper processors in games, it is one of the fastest and most energy-efficient current desktop CPUs for applications, depending on the scenario. It was only released six weeks ago and cost around 640 euros at market launch. It is still listed comparatively frequently, but if you want it immediately, you will have to pay at least 700 euros (ab 682 \u20ac). As with the 9800X3D, the usual premium for new hardware has not disappeared after a few weeks, prices have increased here too. Intel's fastest Arrow Lake CPU is only available at a lower price if you can be patient until at least the end of December, when the processor is available for 10 to 20 euros less \u2013 as a pre-order.\n\nAs many customers have apparently paid the exorbitant prices for both CPUs in recent weeks, it is unlikely that the supply situation will improve soon and that cheaper offers will be available. This also has an effect on generally cheaper CPUs, as some prospective customers are likely to fall back on the previous generations, as the significantly increased prices for the 7800X3D show. Intel's 14700K is also no longer getting any cheaper within the scope of the usual fluctuations, with a minimum price of 380 euros (ab 377,99 \u20ac) for immediate availability.\n\n(nie)"

Whishaw, meanwhile, plays Sam, an assassin sent to protect her.\n\nIt\u2019s been a massive hit since its released, shooting to the top of Netflix\u2019s charts in a busy period, beating out The Madness, The Pembrokeshire Murders, and A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter.\n\nAdvert\n\nAlready renewed for a second season before the show even came out, more Black Doves is on the way, but what inspired the show?\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the show\u2019s creator Joe Barton revealed a bizarre real-life discovery which he says inspired part of the plot.\n\nKeira Knightley in Black Doves (Netflix)\n\nAccording to Barton, he was inspired to write Black Doves after reading a newspaper advice column in which a widow discovered that her husband had had another wife, and their relationship was an affair.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe went on to say: \u201cShe was struggling with the fact that this man she loved had passed away, but she couldn\u2019t tell anyone or share her grief.\n\n\u201cShe felt she had to grieve in private, which is a fascinating and human emotional problem.\u201d\n\nAnyone who\u2019s watched the show will immediately see what that inspired, but if you didn\u2019t and for some reason are still watching, here is a massive spoiler warning.\n\nIf you read beyond this point and think to yell at me for spoiling it for you, don\u2019t .\n\nThe first episode reveals that, as well as engaging in a semi-fake marriage with a Government Minister to trade insider secrets, Knightleys\u2019s Helen was also engaging in an affair.\n\nAdvert\n\nHer affair with Andrew Koji\u2019s Jason is abruptly ended when he is murdered a mere three and a half minutes into the first episode.\n\nBarton also said of the Christmas-set spy thriller\u2019s inspiration in an interview with Variety: \u201cI just love stuff set at Christmas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big Christmas film fan, also big [on] Christmas telly. I love when shows have their one Christmas episode.\n\nBen Whishaw in Black Doves (Netflix)\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cER always had a good one. The West Wing always had a good one. So I\u2019ve always wanted to do it, but it was actually tricky.\n\n\u201cThe first script I wrote in that week between \u2014 I started on Boxing Day, finished it on New Year\u2019s Day \u2014 so I was, like, properly engrossed in Christmas.\n\n\u201cThen obviously time goes on, and I remember sitting with Chris Fry, one of the producers, in like April or something\u2026and both of us just being like, \u2018What do you do at Christmas?\u2019 It goes so quickly from your head, you completely forget.\u201d\n\nBlack Doves is available to stream on Netflix now."

            "article_content": "Home Opinion The theology of Christmas: The Incarnation\n\nAlbert Einstein, one of the most brilliant minds in history, transformed our understanding of the universe. His theory of relativity reshaped physics, while his discovery of the photoelectric effect won him the Nobel Prize in 1921. Yet, for all his genius, Einstein famously dismissed trivial facts. When asked how many feet are in a mile, he replied, \u201cI do not clutter my mind with insignificant information that I can find in less than two minutes in a book.\u201d\n\nThough Einstein acknowledged a divine order in the universe, he rejected the God of the Bible \u2014 the personal God who is both knowable and redemptive. He once remarked, \u201cThe more I study science, the more I believe in God,\u201d but tragically, he never came to know the one true and living God.\n\nThis contrast between human intellect and divine revelation sets the stage for John 1:14, a verse that declares the profound truth at the heart of Christmas: \u201cThe Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\u201d In this one staggering statement in John 1:14, we see a God who enters His creation, reveals His glory, and provides grace and truth for fallen sinners.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nThe Word became flesh\n\nJohn begins this verse with a profound declaration: \u201cThe Word became flesh.\u201d This phrase encapsulates the mystery of the incarnation, where the eternal Logos took on human nature without ceasing to be divine.\n\nThe term Logos (\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) was familiar to John\u2019s Greek and Jewish audiences, but John redefines it in the opening of his Gospel. For Greek philosophers like Heraclitus, the Logos referred to the rational principle and non-personal deity governing the universe. But John declares that the Logos (Word) is not an impersonal force but a person \u2014 Jesus Christ, who was both with God and was God (John 1:1).\n\nJesus, the eternal Word, is the Creator of all things (John 1:3). He is the \u201cI AM\u201d who declared, \u201cBefore Abraham was, I AM\u201d (John 8:58) and \u201cI and the Father are one\u201d (John 10:30). Jesus is sovereign over creation, having formed humanity in His image, established the laws of nature, and upholds the cosmos by His power. As the Nicene Creed affirms, He is \u201cvery God of very God,\u201d worthy of all worship.\n\nJohn\u2019s declaration that \u201cthe Word became flesh\u201d unveils the miracle of the incarnation. The eternal Son of God entered His creation by taking on human nature. This is the mystery that Thomas Watson called \u201cthe infinite love of God.\u201d Christ did not cease to be God but added humanity to His deity, becoming truly God and truly man.\n\nConsider the humility of the incarnation: the creator of the universe was born in a lowly stable, veiled in flesh, and subjected to the limitations of humanity in his human nature. Charles Wesley beautifully captures this truth in his hymn:\n\n\u201cVeiled in flesh the Godhead see,\n\nHail th\u2019incarnate Deity,\n\nPleased with us in flesh to dwell,\n\nJesus, our Immanuel.\u201d\n\nThe incarnation is not only a theological truth but a deeply personal one. Without the Word becoming flesh, humanity would remain lost in sin, alienated from God. As Watson reminds us, \u201cHad not Christ been made flesh, we had been made a curse.\u201d\n\nThe Word tabernacled among us\n\nJohn continues, \u201cand dwelt among us.\u201d The Greek word for \u201cdwelt\u201d (\u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c9) means \u201cto take up residence, or to pitch a tent,\u201d evoking the imagery of the Old Testament tabernacle where God\u2019s presence dwelled among His people.\n\nIn Exodus, God commanded Moses to construct the tabernacle, a portable sanctuary where His presence would reside. The tabernacle was central to Israel\u2019s worship, housing the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark\u2019s mercy seat was the place of atonement, where the high priest sprinkled the sacrificial blood once per year on the Day of Atonement.\n\nThis structure symbolized God\u2019s desire to dwell among His people, yet it was limited by layers of separation. Only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place, and only once every year. When John writes that Jesus \u201cdwelt among us,\u201d he declares that Christ is the fulfillment of the tabernacle. Unlike the temporary, veiled presence of God in the Old Testament, in the person of Jesus God\u2019s presence is fully revealed. As Hebrews 1:3 states, He is \u201cthe radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of His nature.\u201d\n\nThrough Christ, humanity can approach God directly, without fear or separation. He is not only the greater High Priest who offers Himself as the perfect sacrifice, but he is the greater tabernacle granting access to the Father for all who believe. This is the wonder and thrilling truth of the birth of Jesus that is celebrated at Christmas.\n\nThe Word revealed the glory of God\n\nJohn writes, \u201cWe have seen His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father.\u201d The incarnation reveals the radiant glory of God in a way that humanity could see, hear, feel, and touch.\n\nThroughout Scripture, God\u2019s glory is depicted as overwhelming and unapproachable. At Mount Sinai, God\u2019s presence was so terrifying that the Israelites trembled in fear (Exodus 19). When Moses asked to see God\u2019s glory, he was only permitted a partial glimpse, for no one could see God and live (Exodus 33:20). In the tabernacle and later the temple, God\u2019s glory filled the sanctuary, yet it remained hidden behind the veil.\n\nIn Jesus, the glory of God is fully revealed. At the transfiguration, Peter, James, and John witnessed His divine majesty shining through His humanity (Matthew 17:2). After His resurrection, Paul encountered the risen Christ in glory, a vision so blinding it left him temporarily blind (Acts 9:3\u20139).\n\nJesus\u2019 miracles also revealed His glory, demonstrating His divine authority over sickness, nature, and even death. From calming the storm to raising Lazarus, each miracle pointed to His identity as the Son of God. Even as Jesus\u2019 deity was clothed in human flesh, it could not veil his glory. Throughout his earthly ministry, bursts of glory and rays of his majesty are visibly seen in his powerful miracles. Yet, the greatest display of His glory was seen in His humility and suffering. On the cross, Jesus bore the wrath of God for sinners, displaying the glory of divine love and justice and the vindication of it all was his glorious resurrection.\n\nThe Word delivered grace and truth\n\nFinally, John declares that Jesus is \u201cfull of grace and truth.\u201d These two attributes summarize the purpose of the incarnation: to bring salvation through grace and to reveal the truth of God.\n\nGrace is the unmerited favor of God toward sinners. In Jesus, grace is personified and extended to all who believe. As Paul writes, \u201cFor by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God\u201d (Ephesians 2:8). From His first breath in Bethlehem to His final cry on the cross, Jesus\u2019 life was marked by grace. He came not to condemn the world but to save it (John 3:17). His death and resurrection provide eternal life to those who trust in Him.\n\nJesus not only embodies grace but also truth. He declared, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\u201d (John 14:6). In a world filled with deception, Jesus stands as the ultimate standard of truth. His teachings reveal the truth about God, humanity, and salvation. He exposed the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, corrected false interpretations of Scripture, and proclaimed the Gospel of the Kingdom. As the Spirit of Truth, Jesus sanctifies believers, transforming them into His likeness through the power of the Word (John 17:17).\n\nThe incarnation is the foundation of the Christian faith. In Jesus, the eternal Word became flesh, dwelt among us, revealed God\u2019s glory, and brought grace and truth to a lost world. As we celebrate Christmas, let us marvel at the humility and majesty of Christ, who entered His creation to redeem it. And let us live in anticipation of the day when He will dwell with His people forever:\n\n\u201cBehold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God\u201d (Revelation 21:3).\n\nThis is the true theology of Christmas: God became man so that we might dwell with Him in glory. Let us worship the incarnate Word, our Immanuel.\n\nOriginally published at G3 Ministries."

Credit: Doug Bowman, CC BY\n\nWe have only one example of biology forming in the universe\u2014life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don't know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI'm an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I've learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there's advanced alien life out there, I'm on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy\u2014or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it's a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don't agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \"self-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\" That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

It can describe how a group of something becomes more complex \u2013 or even just different \u2013 over time.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet's atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA's definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe\u2014biological or not\u2014to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism's genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it's wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life's essential molecules\u2014at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they're unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they'll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth's crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt's unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that's for life as we know it\u2014for life as we don't know it, all bets are off.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

This is why Dr. Joseph Sang-II Kwon is trying to make hypotheses in a generalizable and systematic manner.\n\nKwon, an associate professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, published his work on blending traditional physics-based scientific models with experimental data to accurately predict hypotheses in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering.\n\nKwon's research extends beyond the realm of traditional chemical engineering. By connecting physical laws with machine learning, his work could impact renewable energy, smart manufacturing, and health care, outlined in his recent paper, \"Adding big data into the equation.\"\n\nDeriving hypotheses for experimental observations typically involves a trial-and-error process. Kwon has developed a systematic framework that integrates specialized knowledge with experimental data to create a more efficient process.\n\n\"The most impactful aspect of this research is its ability to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexity, creating a versatile framework to solve intricate problems,\" Kwon said. \"This versatility means that the potential benefits could reach a wide range of industries and significantly impact daily life.\"\n\nThis research could lead to new drug discovery by incorporating experimental data into these models, Kwon said. This hybrid modeling approach integrates biological knowledge with data to accelerate drug predictions.\n\n\"Developing new drugs is expensive and time-consuming,\" Kwon said. \"But with more advanced models, we can accelerate the discovery and manufacturing processes. Leveraging simulations and machine learning reduces the need for costly lab experiments, saving time and speeding up the discovery of new treatments.\"\n\nHis approach combines physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven components that can adapt and correct predictions based on real-world experimental data.\n\nKwon plans to use these models as a backbone to simulate complex systems and capture underlying physical phenomena that traditional physics-based models cannot capture alone.\n\n\"This methodology allows us to continuously estimate process parameters alongside the hyperparameters of the data-driven component,\" Kwon said. \"By doing so, we ensure that the models are applicable to a wider range of conditions, making them more versatile and better suited to handle new and varied scenarios.\"\n\n\"Purely data-driven models fall short when it comes to capturing the intricacies of these systems,\" Kwon said. \"By blending the two approaches, we can improve the efficiency and reliability of industrial processes that are critical to producing everyday essentials such as energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\"\n\nMore information: Joseph Sang-Il Kwon, Adding big data into the equation, Nature Chemical Engineering (2024).

            "article_content": "Physicists have been puzzling over conflicting observational results pertaining to the accelerating expansion rate of our Universe\u2014a major discovery recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.\n\nHow many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.\n\nJust last year, researchers made a third independent measure of the Universe's expansion by tracking the behavior of a gravitationally lensed supernova, where the distortion in space-time caused by a massive object acts as a lens to magnify an object in the background. The best fits of those models all ended up slightly below the value of the Hubble Constant derived from the CMB, with the difference being within the statistical error. Values closer to those derived from measurements of other supernovae were a considerably worse fit for the data. The method was new, with considerable uncertainties, but it did provide an independent means of getting at the Hubble Constant."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nStrange metallicity and superconductivity. Credit: Nature Physics (2024). DOI: 10.1038/s41567-024-02679-7\n\nA new study by Rice University physicist Qimiao Si unravels the enigmatic behaviors of quantum critical metals\u2014materials that defy conventional physics at low temperatures. Published in Nature Physics Dec. 9, the research examines quantum critical points (QCPs), where materials teeter on the edge between two distinct phases, such as magnetism and nonmagnetism. The findings illuminate the peculiarities of these metals and provide a deeper understanding of high-temperature superconductors, which conduct electricity without resistance at relatively high temperatures.\n\nKey to this study is quantum criticality, a delicate state where the material becomes ultrasensitive to quantum fluctuations\u2014microscopic disturbances that alter electron behavior. While ordinary metals obey well-established principles, quantum critical metals defy these norms, exhibiting strange and collective properties that have long puzzled scientists. Physicists call such systems \"strange metals.\"\n\n\"Our work dives into how quasiparticles lose their identity in strange metals at these quantum critical points, which leads to unique properties that defy traditional theories,\" said Si, the Harry C. and Olga K. Wiess Professor of Physics and Astronomy and director of Rice's Extreme Quantum Materials Alliance.\n\nQuasiparticles, representing the collective behavior of electrons acting like individual particles, play a crucial role in energy and information transfer in materials. However, at QCPs, these quasiparticles vanish in a phenomenon known as Kondo destruction. Here, magnetic moments in the material cease their usual interaction with electrons, dramatically transforming the metal's electronic structure.\n\nThis change is evident in the Fermi surface, a map of possible electron states within the material. As the system crosses the QCP, the Fermi surface abruptly shifts, significantly altering the material's properties.\n\nKondo destruction quantum criticality and large-to-small Fermi surface transformation. Credit: Nature Physics (2024). DOI: 10.1038/s41567-024-02679-7\n\nUniversal behavior across materials\n\nThe study extends beyond heavy fermion metals\u2014materials with unusually heavy electrons\u2014to include copper oxides and certain organic compounds. All of these strange metals exhibit behaviors that defy traditional Fermi liquid theory, a framework used to describe electron motion in most metals. Instead, their properties align with fundamental constants such as Planck's constant, governing the quantum relationship between energy and frequency.\n\nThe researchers identified a condition called dynamical Planckian scaling, where the temperature dependence of electronic properties mirrors universal phenomena like cosmic microwave background radiation and the radiation of the \"black body\" that approximates the behavior of stars. This discovery underscores a shared organizational pattern across various quantum critical materials, offering insights into creating advanced superconductors.\n\nBroader implications\n\nThe research implications extend to other quantum materials, including iron-based superconductors and those with intricate lattice structures. One example is CePdAl, a compound where the interplay of two competing forces\u2014the Kondo effect and RKKY interactions\u2014determines its electronic behavior. By studying these transitions, scientists hope to decode similar phenomena in other correlated materials, where complex interelectronic relationships dominate.\n\nObserving how these forces shape the material at QCPs could help scientists better understand transitions in other correlated materials or those with complex interelectronic relationships.\n\nThis research was co-authored by Haoyu Hu and Lei Chen from Rice's Department of Physics and Astronomy, Extreme Quantum Materials Alliance and Smalley-Curl Institute.\n\nMore information: Haoyu Hu et al, Quantum critical metals and loss of quasiparticles, Nature Physics (2024).

            "article_content": "Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nIllustration by Midjourney.\n\nIn late 2022, the world collectively held its breath as a strange yet exciting new technology emerged from the depths of Silicon Valley. This was ChatGPT \u2014 an artificial intelligence chatbot that could write poetry, debug code, and summarize hundred-page novels with unnerving ease. It attracted a jaw-dropping 100 million users within weeks, breaking records for the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Investors, with visions of a technological revolution shimmering in their eyes (and dollar signs for pupils), began pouring fortunes into anything that bore the acronym \u201cAI.\u201d The future, it seemed, was already here.\n\nBut, as history reminds us with a wry smile, the future doesn\u2019t always arrive as advertised. As the markets ride a wave of AI-induced euphoria, voices of caution are growing louder. Is AI a transformative technology poised to rewrite our lives, or is it the scaffolding for the next catastrophic bubble \u2014 a modern-day echo of the dot-com collapse?\n\nEchoes of 1999\n\nThe numbers are staggering. In 2024, the S&P 500 is on track to close with a 27% gain, building on a 24% surge the year before. We haven\u2019t seen this kind of back-to-back bull run since the halcyon days of the late 1990s, when dot-com stocks inflated to absurd heights. For a brief moment, it seemed every startup with a \u201c.com\u201d in its name was a ticket to unimaginable wealth. But by early 2000, that story turned dark. The bubble popped, and what followed was a painful recession that many would rather forget. By 2002, investor losses were estimated at around $5 trillion. Today, a similar stock market wipeout could be much more dire.\n\nFor instance, at the peak of the dot-com frenzy, Pets.com seemed to embody the future of commerce. Who wouldn\u2019t want pet supplies delivered with just a few clicks? The company launched in 1998, armed with an irresistible mascot: a wide-eyed sock puppet with a penchant for witty banter. The puppet became a minor celebrity, starring in a $1.2 million Super Bowl ad and even appearing on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nBut beneath the charm lay a fragile business model. Shipping bulky bags of dog food wasn\u2019t cheap, and Pets.com sold products at a loss just to attract customers. Investors still believed in the vision, pumping $82.5 million into its IPO in February 2000. Nine months later, the company collapsed. The sock puppet, once a symbol of internet-age optimism, became the unwitting face of dot-com hubris.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia, the undisputed titan of AI hardware, have seen their market value soar to over $3 trillion. In just two years, Nvidia\u2019s stock has surged eightfold. Super Micro Computer, which provides the servers powering AI\u2019s voracious data needs, has followed a similar trajectory. The technology that underpins this growth is genuinely astounding. Yet, as the Associated Press notes, it\u2019s hard to ignore how similar these patterns feel to the 1999 bubble \u2014 a time when investors believed the early internet would mint millionaires out of thin air.\n\nEven the European Central Bank has begun sounding the alarm. In a recent financial review, the ECB warned of an AI stock bubble, suggesting that if AI firms don\u2019t start producing tangible profits, panic could ripple through the global economy. The more feverish the hype, the harder the fall if reality fails to deliver.\n\n\u201cThis concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble,\u201d the ECB said. \u201cAlso, in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments,\u201d the ECB said.\n\nAt the moment, there\u2019s just too much optimism and not enough recognition of what could derail stock momentum, experts seem to warn.\n\nIs This The World\u2019s Most Expensive Gamble?\n\nAnd yet, despite the red flags, the AI juggernaut barrels forward. According to estimates, spending on AI data centers from 2024 to 2027 will exceed $1.4 trillion. These facilities, filled with server racks humming under the weight of immense computation, are the new temples of progress. But as impressive as this investment sounds, only a sliver of American businesses \u2014 about 5% \u2014 have incorporated AI into their services.\n\nThe disparity between investor enthusiasm and business adoption is becoming hard to ignore. While ChatGPT dazzled millions, the electricity needed to train its underlying model, GPT-4, could have powered over three million electric vehicles for an entire year. OpenAI\u2019s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up 1,700 percent since the beginning of 2023 \u2014 but it expects to lose roughly $5 billion this year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses.\n\nEach new leap in AI capability requires ever more data, ever more energy, and ever more money. It\u2019s a cycle that feels less like a virtuous circle and more like an arms race, spiraling toward a point of diminishing returns.\n\nSome of these constraints are fueling an industry-wide scramble for efficiency. Companies are developing specialized chips and streamlined models to mitigate AI\u2019s insatiable hunger for resources. Yet, as of now, the promises are still largely theoretical.\n\nWhat happens if the money \u2014 and patience \u2014 runs out before the solutions arrive?\n\nThe Silent Revolution in the Office Cubicle\n\nCuriously, while corporations debate the merits of AI, employees are embracing it in secret. Studies suggest that a third of American workers use AI at least once a week, often without their bosses\u2019 knowledge. In some sectors, like software engineering, that figure climbs to nearly 80%. Employees are quietly deploying AI to write reports, debug code, and streamline tedious tasks, but they\u2019re keeping it under wraps, fearful that transparency could lead to heavier workloads or job losses. After all, why are you getting paid if most of your job can be done with the help of AI?\n\nThis clandestine adoption hints at a peculiar paradox: AI may be more disruptive than we realize, but the disruption is happening quietly, in the shadows of office cubicles. This isn\u2019t the AI revolution the hype trains promised. It\u2019s a whisper, not a roar.\n\nFor businesses, this means AI adoption is as much about culture as it is about technology. Companies that foster openness and experimentation could harness AI\u2019s full potential, while those clinging to old management styles might miss the boat entirely.\n\nThe Year of Reckoning?\n\nSo, what happens next? 2025 looms large. It could be the year AI makes good on its promise, with breakthroughs in fields as diverse as drug discovery and military defense. Or it could be the year the bubble finally bursts under the weight of unmet expectations.\n\nHistory offers no certainties, but it does offer patterns. The dot-com bubble wasn\u2019t just a story of irrational exuberance; it was also a story of real innovation that eventually found its footing. The internet did transform the world \u2014 just not in the exponential, uninterrupted path investors had hoped for. Perhaps AI is in for a similar treatment: a cataclysmic stock market crash that would hamper progress for a few years while at the same time sanitizing the industry by removing inefficient companies; then, only after a recovery, perhaps will AI make good on its many promises. Just like Pets.com was ahead of its time, so too maybe is the current AI hype train.\n\nThe hype may fade. Stocks may tumble. But beneath the surface, the technology could continue to mature, slowly and steadily finding its place in our lives. As the frenzy quiets down, we may discover that the most profound changes often happen in the spaces between bubbles \u2014 not with a pop, but with a quiet breath of reality."
