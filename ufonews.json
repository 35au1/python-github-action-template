        "article_content": "UFO 50 \u2013 one of the best games of the year (Mossmouth)\n\nA reader explains why he thinks everyone should play indie compilation UFO 50 and why no-one will agree on which are its best games.\n\nUFO 50 was created by Derek Yu (creator of Spelunky), his childhood friend Jon Perry, and a load of other extremely talented game developers. The game was announced in 2017 and finally came out last month and I am pleased to say the wait was more than worth it.\n\nUFO 50 is a collection of 50 complete 8-bit style games (not mini-games) created by the fictional company UFOSoft, with many lasting several hours. As of the time of writing, I have spent around 27 hours on the game and have completed six games and have 100% on no games. There\u2019s so much to explore and I imagine I will be playing this game for many more months (years?) to come. Here\u2019s some of my personal favourites.\n\nParty House\n\nYou\u2019re having a house party and need to invite guests but you want to make sure they\u2019re worth it, whether they bring more cash in or make your party more popular. You also need to make sure the party doesn\u2019t get too rowdy or someone will call the cops! This is one of the most simple games in the collection but it\u2019s also one of the best.\n\nMost time will be spent in the \u2018shop\u2019 section deciding which guests you would like to add to your roster, all of who cost popularity to add. Some earn popularity, some earn cash, and some have special abilities. As you use your cash to expand the house, the game really shines. Using your abilities, you\u2019ll find yourself booting, swapping and predicting guests, while watching those numbers tick up ever so satisfyingly.\n\nOnce you get popular enough, you can start to add star characters to your roster. You have 25 days and 25 parties to get four-star characters at one time to throw the ultimate party. With five scenarios to pick from, each with different characters and a random scenario mode, it\u2019s easy to sink several hours into this one.\n\nParty House is a lot of people\u2019s favourite (Mossmouth)\n\nCamouflage\n\nOut of the many puzzle games in the collection, this one is my favourite. You play as a chameleon who uses the power of camouflage to escape from the various predators in each level. Unlike most games in this collection, Camouflage is very forgiving, enabling you to go back to your previous square when you die.\n\nThe game starts out with stationary enemies but later introduces enemies that patrol around the level, making for some frantic puzzle solving. The puzzles aren\u2019t too difficult but they sure do make you feel smart.\n\nBushido Ball\n\nImagine a samurai-themed fighting game but it\u2019s really just Pong. There are six playable characters each with unique abilities and stats. Each player can roll, slash the ball or do their special when they have enough power. The aim is to beat all the other characters to win the tournament.\n\nWith a full run taking less than 20 minutes, Bushido Ball had me constantly thinking \u2018Just one more go\u2019 until I had spent over two hours in the game and finally beat the tournament.\n\nQuibble Race\n\nThis is the strangest game in the collection and I love it. The aim is to make the most money by betting on Quibble races, by whatever means necessary. This involves bribing characters to break quibble\u2019s legs, drug them or even poison them \u2013 yes, you can play as a quibble murderer.\n\nYou can also sponsor quibbles, which will give you more money when they win, encouraging you to go for the underdogs which makes for some of the most entertaining races. Watching these quibbles constantly fall over and banging the table as your prize quibble falls over and dies is one of the most entertaining experiences gaming has to offer, especially in three-player co-op.\n\nDevilition\n\nDevils have invaded the town and it\u2019s your job to stop them! In each of the 10 rounds, you must use your randomly-assigned characters (and cannons) to create a chain reaction on a 10\u00d710 board that will kill all of the devils. However, you must avoid killing the villagers, as if there are more devils than villagers at the end of the round then you lose! Once you have placed all of the characters, you may detonate one of them and begin the chain reaction. Watching as your creation destroys everything in sight is immensely satisfying.\n\nThere\u2019re many more games in the collection I would have loved to talk about but the best thing I can say is just go play UFO 50 for yourself. What\u2019s so magical about the game is that everyone has a completely different experience and everyone\u2019s top five will be vastly different. By the time I reach 50 hours, this list will probably have changed entirely \u2013 there\u2019s still 15 games I haven\u2019t got round to at all!\n\nBy reader Daniel T.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like Bushido Ball there\u2019s 49 other games to try (Mossmouth)\n\nThe reader\u2019s features do not necessarily represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\n\nYou can submit your own 500 to 600-word reader feature at any time, which if used will be published in the next appropriate weekend slot.

Iowa Educational Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired (IESBVI) staff were there to help the students experience inclusive access to the animals and exhibits.\n\nIESBVI staff taught the students how to use an app that audibly reads sign\u2019s and describes the animal\u2019s enclosure. IESBVI gave demonstrations on how white canes are used and the different types of white canes. There were also monocular and binocular optical telescopes that helped provide better access to low-visions students.\n\nAfter the demonstration students, families, and staff went on a tour of the zoo. Iowa Radio Reading Information Service (IRIS) provided live narration of the animals and exhibits during the tour.\n\nWinterset celebrates 54th annual Covered Bridge Festival\n\nSusan Rolinger, Director of Expanded Learning for IESBVI, says events like these fill her with hope and joy. These events give impaired individuals opportunities and experiences that they might normally miss out on.\n\n\u201cWe want people to see the work that we do and how independent these students are, how they can enjoy days like this with full access,\u201d said Rolinger.\n\nRolinger says that some students may not have need of these tools during their everyday life, causing them to have less knowledge of certain devices or systems. She hopes that by giving students the tools and teaching them to use them, they can utilize them later when the occasion arises.\n\nThis event comes just before White Cane Safety Day, recently changed to Blind Americans Equality Day, on October 15. The day recognizes the white cane as a symbol of safety, mobility, and independence for people who are blind, visually impaired, or deafblind.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Still, DeSantis says he expects the death toll to rise as first responders and public works and utility crews continue conducting their response and recovery efforts.\n\nIt will be some time until a full sense of Hurricane Milton\u2019s damages will be made clear, but here\u2019s an initial look.\n\nHurricane Milton damage:See path of destruction left by tornadoes, flooding"

        "article_content": "LEICESTER \u2014 Legend has it, somewhere in a small private Quaker cemetery in a secluded area of Kettle Brook Reservoir lies a series of portals that lead straight to hell.\n\nFriends Cemetery dates back to the 1700s and is better known by its nickname, Spider Gates, named after the distinctive iron entryway. The iconic gates were put in place in 1895 and have been replaced at least once after being taken without permission. Today, the gates are gone. They were moved to the Leicester Historical Society for safekeeping after several incidents of vandalism and graffiti.\n\nOver the years, the gates that welcome visitors have become a draw in itself. The Leicester Historical Commission is in discussion as to how to best put them back on public display while protecting them at the same time.\n\n\"We're going to complete the restoration of the carriage/summer house located at the Swan Tavern-Leicester Historical Museum by spring 2025 and when that is done, we will decide between one of two plans on where to place them on public display along with a history of the Quakers in Leicester,\" said Joe Lennerton of the Leicester Historical Commission.\n\nWhile most \"spooky\" places have a singular terrifying tale, a monster in the woods, a legendary curse, Spider Gates has all of the above and more, it seems.\n\nAn oak tree, known as the Hanging Tree, is said to be haunted by the ghost of someone who took their own life by hanging. Strange white ooze has been seen seeping from the ground and small stones with strange runes have been found just outside the walls of the cemetery.\n\nNearby, there is said to be a cave where a young woman was murdered decades ago. A river runs nearby and is said to actually be the river Styx, which leads to the underworld.\n\nApparently, another cemetery appears across the street and can only be seen once. And if you listen, visitors have heard a demonic creature roaming the woods.\n\nFinally, if one where to visit the gravestone of Marmaduke Earle at midnight and rest their head on it, legend has it, he will speak to whomever dares get that close.\n\nBut what's the real story? The cemetery is taken care of by a group of Quakers, called the Worcester Friends Meeting, who continue to use the land as a cemetery to this day.\n\n\"We just want the public to treat this cemetery the way one would treat the cemetery their own family members are buried in,\" Karen Sargent of the Worcester Friends Meeting said. \"I didn't grow up with the stories surrounding the cemetery and I've heard several, but like anything, it's like watching scary movies, some people just like to be scared.\"\n\nThere are a few rules for the cemetery. The land is closed from dusk until dawn and paranormal investigations are not permitted.\n\nThat doesn't stop people visiting, lured by the legends. April Kitchen is originally from Norwich, Connecticut, but spends her time traveling the country in her RV, visiting interesting places.\n\n\"I'm always looking for new places to go and experiences to be had,\" she said. \"I typically Google search 'things to do near me' and go from there. Since Halloween is coming up, I included 'spooky' as a keyword for a specific experience.\"\n\nKitchen visited the cemetery twice last month: once in the evening with her daughter and again the following day with her husband.\n\n\"I would definitely say the feel of the cemetery and surrounding area was spookier in the evening compared with midday,\" she said. \"Maybe it was because that time it was just my daughter and me alone, maybe it was the failing light. Lots of sounds in the woods. Both of us thought we saw another cemetery area down the path that leads to the river but didn't go down there. The next day we did walk the path and there was no second cemetery, only a path and the river. I later read some lore for Spider Gates that says you will see a second cemetery once and then never again. So, who knows, maybe that's what that was.\"\n\nThat's not all. Kitchen said she heard \"what sounded like a woman's voice by the river on the second day,\" adding it may have just been the water playing tricks.\n\nOutside of the potentially paranormal, Kitchen said walking through the cemetery, it was noticeably well cared for and it was the large sections of families buried together that caught her attention.\n\n\"You think about what their lives were like. Who they were, and the things they did. And that love of family led them to end up laid to rest together.\"\n\nThe first person buried was John Potter in 1740, one of the earliest Quakers to settle in the area. The most recent grave was filled about a month ago.\n\nSargent said members of the Worcester Friends Meeting and the Southwick family are buried within, adding members of the public must request to be buried at the cemetery.\n\nSeveral notable people are buried within, according to Lennerton. Pliny Earle built the first functioning carding machine in North America, while his son, Dr. Pliny Earle Jr., paid to restore the cemetery in the late 1800s.\n\n\"Also of note,\" Lennerton said. \"Admiral Ralph Earle, graduate of Annapolis and later chief of the bureau of naval ordnance.\" And finally, Leicester native Stephen Earle, the architect behind the Leicester Public Library and Bancroft Tower, Boynton Hall at WPI and the Union Congregational Church on Chestnut Street in Worcester.\n\nA special thank you to Anne for her suggestion of Friends Cemetery and the legends surrounding Spider Gates for this week's edition of Worcester County Wonders.\n\nT&G engagement editor Sarah Barnacle is getting to know Central Mass. by exploring some of the best places to go and things to do in Worcester County.

But there\u2019s one enigmatic figure that has players scratching their heads\u2014a god who appears briefly in a crucial cutscene, yet remains shrouded in secrecy.\n\nZhu Bajie\u2019s first appearance in the story. | Image Credit: Game Science\n\nThis mysterious deity, glimpsed in the Chapter 4 ending animation, has sparked curiosity and speculation among fans. What\u2019s even more fascinating is that the character\u2019s origins are apparently unknown even to Game Science, the developer behind the hit game.\n\nThe Tale of the \u201cDiscount God\u201d\n\n\u26f6 \u26f6 \u26f6 \u26f6 \u26f6\n\n\u00d7\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong, based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, has woven a rich tapestry of mythology and mysteriously ambiguous storytelling. But it\u2019s the animated cutscene at the end of Chapter 4 that\u2019s caught the attention of eagle-eyed players.\n\nThis sequence, which delves into the tragic backstory of Zhu Bajie (also known as \u201cPigsy\u201d to Western audiences), features a mysterious god whose identity has become the subject of much speculation.\n\nIn the animation, we see Zhu Bajie\u2019s past self, the once-mighty Admiral Tianpeng, becoming infatuated with a beautiful heavenly maiden. As he follows her, he stumbles upon a private moment between the maiden and this unknown god. This discovery sets in motion the events that lead to Zhu Bajie\u2019s fall from grace and eventual transformation into the pig-like creature we know from the main story.\n\nBut who is this god? Many players initially assumed it might be the Jade Emperor, a major figure in Chinese mythology. However, the truth might be far stranger than anyone imagined:\n\nComment\n\nbyu/_-K7NG-_ from discussion\n\ninBlackMythWukong\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting that we couldn\u2019t find any official statement from Game Science confirming this story. But if true, it adds a whole new layer of mystery to this already enigmatic character. A god so powerful that he can manifest in a game without even the developers knowing who he is? That\u2019s some next-level divine intervention!\n\nOf course, some players are taking a more pragmatic view of the situation:\n\nComment\n\nbyu/_-K7NG-_ from discussion\n\ninBlackMythWukong\n\nAnd who can blame them? In the world of game development, where budgets can balloon faster than Zhu Bajie at an all-you-can-eat buffet, every little bit helps. Plus, as one astute commenter pointed out, this discount-driven decision-making might be more culturally relevant than we realize:\n\nComment\n\nbyu/_-K7NG-_ from discussion\n\ninBlackMythWukong\n\nWho knew that a mysterious god in a video game could teach us so much about smart shopping?\n\nA Divine DLC Opportunity?\n\nWill the DLC let fans seek justice for their beloved Pig Yaoguai? | Image Credit: Game Science\n\nWhile the Discount God\u2019s identity remains a mystery, some players are already clamoring for more. The original poster\u2019s sentiment (\u201cdeserves a thorough beatdown\u201d) is shared by many who\u2019ve grown attached to the lovable character of Zhu Bajie throughout their journey in Black Myth: Wukong. But will we actually see the Discount God make an appearance in future content? That\u2019s the million-yuan question:\n\nComment\n\nbyu/_-K7NG-_ from discussion\n\ninBlackMythWukong\n\nWhile Game Science has been tight-lipped about official DLC plans, the rumor mill has been working overtime. Some reports suggest that the developer aims to release two DLCs before moving on to their next project, Black Myth: Jiang Ziya. There\u2019s even talk of a release window for the first DLC that appears to be all but confirmed.\n\nOf course, in the world of game development, nothing is certain until it\u2019s officially announced. As one wise commenter put it:\n\nComment\n\nbyu/_-K7NG-_ from discussion\n\ninBlackMythWukong\n\nWhether or not we\u2019ll ever get to face off against the Discount God in a future DLC, one thing\u2019s for certain: Black Myth: Wukong has captured the imaginations of players around the world, weaving together mythology, mystery, and apparently, savvy business practices. And really, isn\u2019t that what great storytelling is all about?\n\nSo, what do you think? Is the Discount God a stroke of accidental genius or a divine accounting error? And more importantly, do you think he could hook us up with a discount on the eventual DLC? Let us know in the comments below!"

        "article_content": "Researchers at the University of Dundee have revealed in the greatest detail yet the workings of molecules called 'protein degraders' which can be deployed to combat what have previously been regarded as 'undruggable' diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nProtein degrader molecules are heralding a revolution in drug discovery, with more than 50 drugs of this type currently being tested in clinical trials for patients with diseases for which no other options exist.\n\nThe Centre for Targeted Protein Degradation (CeTPD) at the University of Dundee is one of the world's leading centres for research into how protein degraders work and how they can most effectively be put to use for a new generation of drugs.\n\nNow researchers have revealed previously invisible levels of detail and understanding of how the protein degraders work, which in turn is allowing for even more targeted use of them at the molecular level.\n\nPhD student Charlotte Crowe, together with Dr Mark Nakasone, Senior Postdoctoral Scientist at CeTPD, used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which enables scientists to see how biomolecules move and interact with each other.\n\nThis works by flash-freezing proteins and using a focused electron beam and a high-resolution camera to generate millions of 2D images of the protein. They then used sophisticated software and artificial intelligence (AI) models which allowed them to generate 3D snapshots of the degrader drugs working in action.\n\nTheir latest research is published in the prestigious journal Science Advances and is expected to constitute a landmark contribution to research in the field of TPD and ubiquitin mechanisms.\n\n\"We have reached a level of detail where we can see how these protein degraders work and can be deployed [to recruit the disease-causing protein ] and target the 'bull's eye', in molecular terms,\" said Charlotte Crowe, who carried out the research together with a wider team of Dundee researchers.\n\n\"Protein degrader molecules work in a way that is fundamentally different from the way conventional drugs work. However, until recently the exact details of how this process works at the molecular level had remained elusive.\n\n\"Proteins are typically a few nanometres large, which is 1 billionth of a metre, or 1 millionth of the width of a hair. So being able to 'see' them in action has not been possible, up until now.\n\n\"We have now been able to build a moving image of how it all happens, which means we can more specifically control the process with an incredible level of detail.\"\n\nProfessor Alessio Ciulli, Director of CeTPD and one of the world leaders in the field of targeted protein degradation, said, \"This is incredibly exciting work and opens up the possibility of even more effectively targeted drugs able to finally treat some diseases which up until now have been too difficult to tackle.\"\n\nHow it works\n\nProteins are essential for our cells to function properly, but when these do not work correctly they can cause disease.\n\nTargeted protein degradation involves redirecting protein recycling systems in our cells to destroy the disease-causing proteins.\n\nProtein degraders work by capturing the disease-causing protein and making it stick like a glue to the cellular protein-recycling machinery, which then tags the protein as expired in order to destroy it.\n\nThe tag is a small protein called ubiquitin, which effectively gets fired at the disease-causing protein like a bullet. In order for the process to work effectively, ubiquitin must hit the right spots on the target protein so that it gets tagged effectively. The new work by the Dundee team enables them to see how the bullet hits the proverbial bull's eye.\n\nWorking with a protein degrader molecule called MZ1, which was developed in the Ciulli laboratory at Dundee, and using high-end mass spectrometry, they were able to identify exactly where on the target protein the vital 'tags' are added.\n\nThe work shows how degrader drugs hold onto and position disease-causing proteins, making them good targets for receiving ubiquitin molecules (ie. \"ubiquitin-atable\") which then leads to their destruction inside the cell.\n\nProtein degradation efficiency and productivity is dependent on the degrader molecule's ability to hold tight onto the disease-causing protein, and in a position where it can most effectively act. This latest research paints a bull's eye and holds it steady enough for the molecule to be accurately targeted.\n\nProfessor Ciulli said this and other recently published papers were contributing to rapid development of an exciting field of science and drug discovery.\n\n\"This rapidly expanding field is fascinating and complementary articles on how this cellular protein-recycling machinery works to fire ubiquitin molecules at target proteins were recently published by the laboratories of biochemists Brenda Schulman (Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry) and Gary Kleiger (University of Nevada, Las Vegas).\n\n\"Our collective work provides a leap forward in understanding that will accelerate development of new TPD drugs in future\".\n\nThe Dundee team\n\nThis work comes from a 'local' collaboration between two groups of scientists at the University of Dundee.\n\nIn the Centre for Targeted Protein Degradation, led by Professor Alessio Ciulli, experts in TPD, were Charlotte Crowe, Mark Nakasone, Conner Craigon, Gajanan Sathe and Nikolai Makukhin.\n\nThey worked with Professor Ron Hay, an expert in ubiquitin, based in the School of Life Sciences, and colleagues Sarah Chandler and Mike Tatham."
