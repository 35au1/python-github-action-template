            "article_content": "The internet has been left divided over an 'egg-shaped craft' recorded during a UAP retrieval operation after the video was aired on TV for the first time.\n\nNewsNation aired the footage that 'clearly showed' the object dangling in a sling from a helicopter on Saturday night.\n\nThe alleged craft was about 20ft long and resembled the UAP encountered by the Navy off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects, NewsNation reported.\n\nIt was pointed out in the video that the object had no markings, being 'perfectly smooth', and no 'visible' means of propulsion or way to look inside.\n\nAfter the segment aired, Redditors had mixed opinions on the footage's veracity, although many were impressed by what they saw.\n\n'This is pretty cool. I don\u2019t know what you guys were expecting of a nighttime retrieval. This is actually more clear than I thought it would be. It helps to lower expectations,' one wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'I had a feeling that the video would be somewhat ambiguous. I'm not sure this is gonna move the needle without more substantiating evidence. I think it's great, personally, but this isn't gonna convince Joe Taxpayer.'\n\n'Probably is real. But you aren\u2019t going to convince people with this. To claim this is any different from any other sketchy video already seen (outside the gimbal & go fast) is a stretch & hardly going to make anybody new sit up & take notice. Too bad,' another wrote.\n\nNewsNation aired the footage which 'clearly showed' the object dangling in a sling from a helicopter\n\nThe outlet was told the craft was about 20ft long. It's said to resemble the UAP encountered by the Navy off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects\n\nHowever, other users were much less convinced.\n\n'Well, the video quality is better than I expected, I'll give them that. The object itself? With no frame of reference to judge size, it could be an actual chicken egg as far as I can tell,' one Redditor wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'This video could not have been cheap to make with the cost of eggs these days!'\n\n'No reference to size, this could literally be a chicken egg on a string, with helicopter noises edited in,' a third added.\n\n'This shows nothing. This is not earth shattering, redefining man kind evidence they were promising,' another wrote.\n\nA fifth commented: 'I knew the footage was not going to be good. But what exactly am I looking at here? An egg on the end of a fishing rod?'\n\nOther users pointed out some potential issues with the credibility of the footage.\n\n'What kind of terrain is this supposed to be on? Something about the scaling and shadow feels off,' one questioned.\n\n'Well, the video quality is better than I expected, I'll give them that. The object itself? With no frame of reference to judge size, it could be an actual chicken egg as far as I can tell,' one user wrote\n\nAnother eagle-eyed user said: 'If this was in the desert how is the helicopter not blowing up dust and sand like crazy.'\n\n'So, like, wouldn't they drop off the egg thing on a truck or something or a base? Why are they dropping it off on the ground of what appears an empty desert field?' another wrote.\n\n'No prop wash? I could fake this in my house right now in an hour,' a Redditor added.\n\nAnother user replied by pointing out the lack of sway in the rope.\n\n'So, they retrieved and filmed just an egg-shaped thing. It wasn't flying, it wasn't doing anything. What a load of utter nonsense this is,' one user said.\n\nThe video, which was kept in the dark until its bombshell release, is the latest video footage that has made the rounds online in recent weeks seemingly depicting a UFO.\n\nWidespread interest and coverage of the subject surged after drones were seen flying across New Jersey last month.\n\nOffering a solution to the mystery, Tucker Carlson made a shocking claim that the mysterious drones were controlled by a Chinese mothership satellite.\n\nTucker Carlson discussed the mysterious drones on his show this week, saying he was told the objects were controlled by China\n\nThe White House repeatedly stated that the drone sightings are not a foreign adversary, pose no threat and are not part of a US military operation\n\nThe first sightings appeared over the Picatinny Arsenal in Rockaway and President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster in November, followed by thousands more in the skies.\n\nWhile the US government was quick to dismiss claims they were foreign adversaries, Carlson claimed he was told otherwise.\n\nHe said, 'an intel person' told him that the drones 'were in fact Chinese,' explaining the US government took down a Chinese satellite 'that was a command and control satellite for these drones.'\n\nCarlson appeared to be hinting at a Beijing-operated satellite known as GaoJing 1-02 which fell from space on December 21.\n\nAstronomers tracking such devices confirmed the Chinese satellite re-entered Earth's atmosphere above New Orleans and headed north towards Mississippi, Arkansas and Missouri before burning up in the atmosphere.\n\nBut Carlson claimed it was 'taken down by the US government.'\n\nHe made the claims while speaking with independent journalist Michael Shellenberger, who heard a similar explanation for the drones.\n\n'Somebody told me that that the military got one of the orbs, opened it up and it was Chinese,' Shellenberger said.\n\nThe White House repeatedly stated that the drone sightings - which coincidentally began on November 18 - are not a foreign adversary, pose no threat and are not part of a US military operation.\n\nBut Carlson said his inside source told him that 'the belief was the Chinese government was sending the following message, 'We're moving on Taiwan.''"

            "source": "AOL",
            "article_content": "SoundHound AI has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in the past year, rising a stunning 602% as of this writing on the back of the company's phenomenal growth, as well as a small investment by artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer Nvidia in this small but fast-growing voice AI solutions provider.\n\nSoundHound's terrific rise has brought its market capitalization to $4.7 billion as of this writing. However, the company has been prone to wild swings in its stock price in the past year. SoundHound stock is down 35% as of this writing in 2025 even in the absence of any company-specific information that could have caused such a steep sell-off.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nOne reason why investors may be hitting the sell button and booking profits in SoundHound stock is because of its extremely expensive valuation. The stock is currently trading at 58 times sales. That's richer than even Nvidia, a company that's much bigger and has been growing at a faster pace than SoundHound.\n\nThe rich valuation explains why SoundHound's 12-month median price target of $9 suggests that the stock could drop nearly 30% from current levels. So, investors looking to capitalize on the AI boom may consider looking elsewhere as SoundHound's valuation indicates that the stock may have gotten ahead of itself. This is where C3.ai (NYSE: AI) and DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN) come into play.\n\nBoth of these tech companies have been growing at a steady pace and are trading at reasonable valuations, and it won't be surprising to see them overtaking SoundHound's market cap in the coming year. Let's look at the reasons why.\n\n1. C3.ai\n\nC3.ai carries a 12-month consensus price target of $40, which would be a 30% jump from current levels. Assuming C3.ai hits that mark in the coming year, its market cap could jump to almost $5.2 billion from the current level of $3.99 billion. And if SoundHound AI stock drops as much as consensus estimates are projecting, there is a good chance that C3.ai will become a more valuable company in the span of a year.\n\nThe good part is that C3.ai's recent results demonstrate that it is indeed capable of delivering the upside that Wall Street is expecting from the company in the next year. The company's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on Oct. 31, 2024) increased 29% year over year to $94.3 million. That was a solid improvement over the 21% year-over-year revenue growth that C3.ai reported in the first quarter of the fiscal year.\n\nC3.ai also increased its full-year revenue guidance to a midpoint of $388 million from the previous estimate of $382.5 million. The updated guidance would translate into a 25% improvement over fiscal 2024 levels when the company's top line increased at a relatively slower pace of 16%. So, C3.ai's growth has accelerated nicely in the ongoing fiscal year, and that trend seems here to stay considering the huge addressable market opportunity the company is sitting on.\n\nMordor Intelligence estimates that the cloud AI services market could generate $89 billion in revenue this year. It is expected to clock a compound annual growth rate of 32% through 2030, generating $363 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period. C3.ai has set its sights on this opportunity through a wide portfolio of more than 100 enterprise AI applications that can be deployed in multiple industries ranging from oil and gas to manufacturing, to defense and intelligence, to retail, to government applications.\n\nMore importantly, it is offering these services through popular cloud computing platforms such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud. These channel partners are helping C3.ai drive strong growth in the number of agreements that it is signing with customers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, C3.ai closed 62% of its 58 agreements through the partner network. Google Cloud alone accounted for 20 of those agreements, a jump of 180% from the prior year.\n\nThis solid sales momentum through the partner network is here to stay as C3.ai has been tightening its relationship with the likes of Microsoft, which should allow it to reach a wider customer base and tap the massive opportunity present in the cloud AI market.\n\nFinally, C3.ai is trading at a sales multiple of 11, much more affordable than SoundHound AI. Moreover, C3.ai's improving growth profile means that it can justify its valuation, suggesting that the stock can indeed head higher in the coming year and overtake SoundHound's market cap.\n\n2. DigitalOcean\n\nDigitalOcean is another company that's on track to capitalize on the growing adoption of cloud-based AI services. The company provides an on-demand cloud infrastructure platform that customers can rent to build, deploy, and scale applications. DigitalOcean is now offering cloud infrastructure services powered by graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia to customers so that they can train AI models, generate images, and render videos in the cloud without having to incur any hardware costs.\n\nThese moves could pave the way for stronger growth at DigitalOcean as its AI-focused offerings could encourage customers to spend more money. The good part is that DigitalOcean is already winning a bigger share of its customers' wallets. The company's average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 11% year over year in the third quarter of 2024 to $102.51.\n\nThe increase in the ARPU explains why DigitalOcean's earnings increased at a faster pace of 18% year over year to $0.52 per share as compared to the 12% jump in its revenue. The company's 2024 guidance of $776 million points toward a 12% increase in its top line from 2023. Analysts are expecting an acceleration in DigitalOcean's growth in 2025 and 2026.\n\nDOCN Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nDOCN Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\n\nHowever, don't be surprised to see the company delivering stronger growth in both 2025 and 2026. It is worth noting that DigitalOcean's 2024 revenue guidance has increased from its original forecast of $765 million issued in February last year. With the addition of AI-specific offerings into its portfolio, DigitalOcean may be able to capture a bigger share of its addressable market, which it expects to hit $213 billion in 2027, and clock stronger-than-expected growth.\n\nAs such, buying DigitalOcean stock right now looks like a good idea as it is trading at just 4.4 times sales and 18 times forward earnings. Moreover, analysts are expecting the stock to hit a median price target of $40 in the next year, which would be a 19% jump from current levels. DigitalOcean is capable of achieving that target in the coming year or even beating it.\n\nIf that's indeed the case and DigitalOcean jumps 19% in the next year, its market cap could jump to $3.7 billion, which would be enough to help it overtake SoundHound if the latter's stock price drops as much as analysts are anticipating.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in DigitalOcean right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in DigitalOcean, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and DigitalOcean wasn\u2019t one of them.

(WVVA) - The Campbell-Flannagan-Murrell House was built in the late 1800s, serving as a home for generations of a Hinton family, as well as as a general store for a time.\n\nNow, it stands as a museum, and a part of Summers County history. On Jan. 18, the museum partnered with Appalachian Ghosts Tours to offer a unique experience of history, culture, and potentially paranormal spirits with guided tours and an investigation.\n\nAttempting to encounter spirits can require some technology, and as the Executive Director of Appalachian Ghost Tours, Mark Covey, explained, special equipment as well as ordinary objects can get the job done.\n\n\u201cWe have EMF meters that will go off if, like, an electric spike gets near you. We have REM pods that basically do the same thing, but they stay in a stationary area and they will make a lot of noise,\u201d said Covey. \u201cWe have cat balls that, you know, you wouldn\u2019t think would be anything, but they will just be sitting in there on something solid and they will start to light up.\u201d\n\nAlthough the house is simply a museum by day, even those familiar with the home have experienced unexplained happenings.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been times when I\u2019ve been in this house by myself and heard footsteps and nobody\u2019s been in the house, so yeah, I think that there\u2019s something going on, but I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s malicious in any way,\u201d said Carol Jackson, President of the Board of Trustees over the Campbell-Flannagan-Murrell House Museum.\n\nThis event is part of an ongoing effort for more paranormal tourism in Appalachia, bringing attention to smaller communities that are rich with folklore and paranormal history.\n\n\u201cSouthern West Virginia is absolutely overflowing with the haunted stories, the paranormal, there is an energy here like no other and there is a history here like no other,\u201d explained Pamela Huff, a member of Appalachian Ghost Tours.\n\nFor more information on the museum, you can view their website or Facebook page, and to keep up to date with Appalachian Ghost Tours, click here.\n\nCopyright 2025 WVVA.

It\u2019s so strange. And it\u2019s not their fault.\"\n\nRobbie released his own Netflix documentary back in 2023, but the pop star previously admitted that he struggled to actually watch it.\n\nThe award-winning star revealed that he struggled to relive some painful moments from his life.\n\nHe told 'The Project': \"It was deeply unpleasant, to be honest with you.\n\n\"I think that people don't even like looking at selfies of themselves and hearing their own voice. And if you multiply that by watching you descend into mental illness and agoraphobia and depression and anxiety and you are watching a nervous breakdown, it's not a normal thing to do.\""

            "article_content": "In a groundbreaking discovery that sounds like science fiction but is absolutely real, researchers have found that your eyes contain hidden signals that could predict your risk of having a stroke. This revolutionary finding isn\u2019t just another medical study, it\u2019s a potential game-changer in how we approach stroke prevention and early detection.\n\nThe incredible science behind retinal fingerprints\n\nScientists have identified 29 unique vascular indicators in your retina that serve as warning signs for stroke risk. These tiny blood vessels in your eyes create patterns as unique as your fingerprints, and their condition can reveal crucial information about your overall health. Within these indicators, 17 are density-related markers that can increase your stroke risk by up to 19% when altered. These changes are like tiny red flags waving in your eyes, signaling potential danger before other symptoms appear. The remaining indicators focus on the size and twistedness of blood vessels, with changes potentially raising stroke risk by nearly 20%. Think of these vessels as tiny roads in your eyes, their condition reflecting the health of your entire cardiovascular system.\n\nWhy this discovery is absolutely mind-blowing\n\nTraditional stroke risk assessments often involve invasive procedures and expensive tests. But this new method requires nothing more than a specialized photograph of your eye. The implications are enormous, especially for communities where access to advanced medical testing is limited or cost-prohibitive.\n\nThe beauty of this breakthrough lies in its simplicity. During a routine eye exam, doctors can capture detailed images of your retina and analyze them for these crucial indicators. It\u2019s painless, quick, and could potentially save countless lives through early detection.\n\nThe fascinating connection between your eyes and brain\n\nYour retina isn\u2019t just a window to your soul, it\u2019s actually an extension of your brain. Every tiny blood vessel in your eye tells a story about the health of your brain\u2019s blood vessels. This connection explains why changes in your retinal vasculature can predict stroke risk with remarkable accuracy.\n\nWhat makes this discovery revolutionary\n\nThe research team analyzed data from over 45,000 participants. This massive study revealed that retinal analysis combined with basic demographic information could predict stroke risk as accurately as traditional methods.\n\nWhat\u2019s truly remarkable is how this technology could transform preventive healthcare. Imagine walking into your local eye clinic and getting a comprehensive stroke risk assessment during your regular eye exam. This isn\u2019t just convenient, it\u2019s revolutionary for global health care accessibility.\n\nThe global impact of this breakthrough\n\nThis discovery could dramatically change how we approach stroke prevention worldwide. In regions where advanced medical facilities are scarce, a simple eye scan could become a lifesaving tool. The technology could help identify at-risk individuals years before they might experience a stroke, allowing for early intervention and prevention strategies.\n\nHealthcare providers are particularly excited about implementing this technology in primary care settings. It could become as routine as checking blood pressure, but with the potential to reveal much more detailed information about cardiovascular health.\n\nWhat this means for the future of healthcare\n\nThe implications extend far beyond stroke prediction. Researchers believe similar retinal analysis could help predict other conditions like heart disease and dementia. This opens up endless possibilities for early detection and prevention of various diseases through simple eye examinations.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, we might see artificial intelligence systems analyzing these retinal images in real-time, providing instant risk assessments and recommendations. This could revolutionize how we approach preventive healthcare, making it more accessible and effective than ever before.\n\nThe discovery of retinal vascular fingerprints as predictors of stroke risk isn\u2019t just a scientific breakthrough, it\u2019s a glimpse into the future of medicine. It shows us that sometimes the most powerful diagnostic tools are hidden in plain sight, waiting to be understood and utilized. As this technology develops and becomes more widely available, it could transform how we approach disease prevention and ultimately save countless lives through early detection and intervention."

It estimates that 14% of the workforce \u2014 around 5 million Filipino workers \u2014 are at risk of displacement this year due to artificial intelligence (AI) and climate change,\u201d FFW President Jose Sonny G. Matula told BusinessWorld in a Viber message over the weekend.\n\nThe ILO\u2019s World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2025, released last week, found employment growth globally remained \u201ctoo weak\u201d to significantly impact lingering decent work deficits.\n\nWhile employment growth remains steady, various factors are testing the resilience of labor markets worldwide, it added.\n\n\u201cThe lack of faster global productivity growth is partly linked to the failure of structural change to move people out of agriculture into manufacturing and services,\u201d it noted.\n\n\u201cGiven the poor working conditions in much of farming outside advanced economies, this also means that working poverty and informality have not benefited from people moving out of agriculture to better-paying jobs in industry and services,\u201d it added.\n\nIndividuals in informal employment, particularly in agriculture and other sectors like wholesale and retail trade, often face irregular income and lack access to social protection, it added.\n\n\u201cIn this context, the vigorous exercise of the Department of Labor and Employment\u2019s (DoLE) inspection and visitorial powers under the Labor Code is essential,\u201d Mr. Matula said.\n\n\u201cStrengthened monitoring and enforcement mechanisms will ensure that employers comply with labor standards, while the Employment Plan should adapt to rapidly changing labor market dynamics, including those influenced by technology and climate change,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 2024, global employment grew alongside the expanding labor force, maintaining the global unemployment rate at a steady 5%, consistent with the level recorded in 2023, the ILO noted.\n\nHowever, this growth remains insufficient to address persistent decent work deficits as young workers continue to face high unemployment rates, around 12.6%, with little sign of improvement, it added.\n\nLabor Secretary Bienvenido E. Laguesma said the department conducted \u201cextensive national consultations,\u201d culminating in the upcoming 10-year Trabaho Para sa Bayan (TPB) Plan to address weak job growth.\n\n\u201cThrough these initiatives, we have identified several key areas of intervention that align with the goals of the TPB Plan and aim to address the challenges of regional employment disparities, particularly in rural areas,\u201d he told BusinessWorld in a Viber message over the weekend.\n\n\u201cAgriculture remains a cornerstone of rural employment, and we are committed to transforming this sector to boost productivity and job creation,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted the Labor department aims to introduce technology-enabled farming practices, climate-resilient methods and value-added processes into agribusiness through the Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives will not only create more jobs but also enhance the sustainability and profitability of rural livelihoods,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Agency\u2019s (PSA) November 2024 Labor Force Survey, the agriculture sector experienced the highest year on year job loss, with 1.99 Filipinos leaving the sector.\n\nThe agency attributed the loss to typhoons.\n\nRURAL WORKFORCE\n\nAccording to Mr. Laguesma, DoLE is empowering local government units (LGUs) to spearhead rural development by supporting them with investment strategies, microfinance for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and infrastructure projects under the Build Better More program.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives will ensure that rural areas become hubs for inclusive economic activity,\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition, DoLE is collaborating with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and local institutions, prioritizing tailored skills training.\n\nPrograms will focus on green skills development, digital upskilling and vocational training to prepare rural workers for opportunities in sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, and renewable energy, he noted.\n\n\u201cOur Public Employment Service Offices (PESOs) are key to facilitating job placement and matching in rural areas,\u201d he added, noting that digitalization and enhancing labor market intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe aim to make employment services more accessible and effective, enabling rural job seekers to connect with opportunities tailored to their skills and aspirations,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe labor chief also added the department is committed to fostering sustainable job opportunities in agriculture, eco-tourism and clean energy. These green initiatives will ensure long-term job creation while protecting environmental resources.\n\nSocial safety nets for rural workers are critical, he noted, adding the ILO has been helping DoLE in achieving these initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe will broaden coverage of social protection programs to include informal workers, addressing vulnerabilities and providing stability during economic transitions,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBy prioritizing rural job creation and addressing regional disparities, we aim to build a resilient and equitable labor market where every Filipino has access to quality employment.\u201d"

The incident, which involved an upgraded Starship carrying a test payload, prompted airlines to reroute flights over the Gulf of Mexico as debris scattered, marking a setback for Elon Musk's rocket program. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, in coordination with Turks and Caicos officials, is investigating the fallout, though no injuries have been reported.\n\nIn Belgium, scientist Clement Martin is collaborating with federal police to create a groundbreaking scent mimicking the smell of dried bones, helping sniffer dogs locate long-missing remains. This innovation follows Martin's earlier work isolating the scent of decomposing flesh, now essential in training cadaver dogs across Belgium.\n\nMeanwhile, archaeological explorations in Pompeii have uncovered an opulent private bath complex, providing insights into the affluent lifestyle of the Romans before the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The newly unearthed site features hot, warm, and cold baths that could accommodate up to 30 guests, adorned with Greek mythological themes, showcasing the luxury of that era.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an incredible technology, and we've only scratched the surface of its potential. Currently, it's being used as a program on the side of normal work, but it's about to enter a new phase: Agentic AI. Agentic AI, often called AI agents, involves setting up software programs to do tasks that humans normally do. This next phase in implementing AI is critical, as it will allow those at the cutting edge to do more with fewer resources.\n\nOne of the leaders in agentic AI is Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). The software company is making a heavy push to promote and integrate agentic AI, and it also has one of the best platforms for implementing it.\n\nSalesforce's platform is ripe for agentic AI integration\n\nSalesforce makes customer relationship management (CRM) software. CRM is an incredibly broad sector but can generally be summarized as a business interaction with a potential customer from the marketing stage to after-sale support. There's a lot that happens between those two points, and Salesforce software is there to offer support along the way.\n\nMany customer interactions can be automated by AI agents, which is why agentic AI is such a massive trend for Salesforce. As with most software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, the more add-ons you have from the base software package, the more expensive it gets. This unlocks another milestone for the generative AI trend; we're reaching a point where many companies are starting to monetize their AI investments.\n\nSalesforce's CEO and co-founder, Marc Benioff, is extremely bullish on agentic AI. During the company's 2024 Dreamforce conference, he stated, \"This is what AI was meant to be.\" That's a big statement, but the ability for companies to become more efficient and free their workers up to do tasks that require original thinking will be a huge change for many in the workforce.\n\nHowever, does this one technology have the ability to drive Salesforce's stock to new heights?\n\nSalesforce needs this new technology to kick-start growth again\n\nSalesforce is a mature software company that started to shift from growth-at-all-costs to maximizing profitability a few years ago. However, its sales growth has been a bit slow, by most software company standards, over the past few quarters. In its fiscal 2025's third quarter (ended Oct. 31), revenue was up 8% year over year to $9.44 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) were $1.60 versus $1.26 a year ago -- a 27% gain.\n\nEPS growth outpaced revenue growth because of Salesforce's rising margins. During last year's third quarter, Salesforce posted operating margins of 17.8%. This year, it delivered 20.6% operating margins. This will be a key trend to watch, as some of the most profitable software companies can reach profit margins of up to 30%. It will likely be some time before Salesforce can reach that level (if it can), but shareholders will be elated if it does.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is concerned about collaborations between large cloud providers and leading developers of generative artificial intelligence (AI). It is particularly concerned about Microsoft's investment of USD 13 billion in OpenAI and the collaboration between Google and Anthropic. The latter two are actually competing with each other with their Gemini and Claude models, but are also strategic partners. In these cases, the FTC sees an increased risk that the younger AI companies could be completely bought up or otherwise taken over by the technology giants in the near future. The authority is also skeptical about the billion-euro investment by cloud market leader Amazon in Anthropic.\n\nAnzeige\n\nThe relevant report published by the antitrust watchdog on Friday \"sheds light on the question of how partnerships between large technology companies lead to lock-ins\", explained FTC boss Lina Khan. Such collaborations could deprive other start-ups of important AI research results, which could undermine competition. More and more companies are relying on generative AI, Khan explained. Regulators and policy makers must therefore remain vigilant to ward off business strategies \"that undermine open markets, opportunities and innovation\".\n\nThe authors of the report shed light on aspects of the structure of partnerships between cloud providers and AI developers. For example, they look at the equity and revenue-sharing rights as well as certain advisory, control and exclusivity rights that Microsoft & Co. receive as part of their financing. The competition watchdogs are also concerned about obligations that require OpenAI and Anthropic to spend a large proportion of their partner's investments on their cloud services. The deals also include access to \"large amounts of computer resources at reduced prices\", intellectual property rights relating to the latest AI models and certain financial and training data. In addition, there would be opportunities to expand current products \u2013 such as the integration of AI applications into cloud offerings or other solutions.\n\nEU antitrust watchdogs also have questions\n\nFurthermore, the FTC is critical of the ability of collaborations to influence access to computer resources and highly skilled workers in a way that could massively impair competition. It also criticizes the potential of the deals to increase contractual and technical switching costs for AI developer partners. This would make it more difficult for OpenAI and Anthropic to find other cloud service providers. It remains to be seen what the new leadership of the FTC under the second Trump administration, which takes office next week, will do with the results.\n\nFormer EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in the summer that Microsoft's investment in OpenAI was not yet a case for a review under merger control rules. However, she said that both companies would be asked questions under antitrust rules \"to understand whether certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative impact on competitors\". The EU executive also wants to scrutinize the impact of the agreement between Google and Samsung to pre-install Gemini Nano on certain Samsung devices. There is a risk that tech giants could make it difficult for smaller developers of AI models to \"reach end users\".\n\n(axv)"

            "article_content": "\u2018Funny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to Democrats,\u2019 says one tech titan.\n\nTwo Democratic senators are accusing tech giants of trying to \u201cinfluence and sway the actions and policies of the incoming administration\u201d by donating millions of dollars to President Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. In response, some of those tech titans are remarking that they never got similarly stern letters when they donated to Democrats in the past.\n\nSenator Warren and Senator Bennet, two members of the tax-writing Finance Committee, first raised their concerns about the donations in a letter to OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, a longtime Democratic donor who this year personally gave $1 million of his own money to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund.\n\n\u201cBig Tech companies have come under increased scrutiny from federal regulators for antitrust violations, violations of privacy, and harms to workers, consumers, and competition,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cWe are concerned that your company and other Big Tech donors are using your massive contributions to the inaugural fund to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration in an effort to avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to democrats,\u201d Mr. Altman wrote on X in response to the letter.\n\nMr. Altman is just one Silicon Valley titan who is personally giving money to the inauguration fund. The chief executive of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, and the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook, have also given $1 million of their own money to support Monday\u2019s inaugural activities.\n\nCompanies, too, are showering Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing-in celebrations with cash. Amazon is giving $1 million after donating just over $50,000 to Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration, and just over $250,000 to President Biden\u2019s inauguration ceremony. Google \u2014 which donated $285,000 to the 2017 inauguration and just over $337,000 to the 2021 inauguration \u2014 is giving $1 million to Trump this time around. Microsoft gave $500,000 to both Trump\u2019s first inauguration and Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration, though they have given $1 million to the 2025 inauguration fund.\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has already given $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund via his company, after not giving a penny to any past inauguration funds. Some of Trump\u2019s closest allies and supporters don\u2019t necessarily see these tech leaders as true converts to the movement, but rather businessmen who are just trying to survive in Trump\u2019s political landscape.\n\nThe president-elect\u2019s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, compared men like Messrs. Altman and Zuckerberg to military leaders who have issued full surrenders. \u201cI look at this, and I think most people at our movement look at this, as: President Trump broke the oligarchs. He broke them, and they surrendered,\u201d Mr. Bannon told ABC News on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI view this as September of 1945 on the [USS] Missouri. You have the Imperial high command, and [Trump] is like Douglass MacArthur,\u201d Mr. Bannon added, comparing tech giants to the defeated Japanese Empire.\n\nIn their letter, Ms. Warren and Mr. Bennet asked Mr. Altman to provide answers to a number of questions aimed not only at him, but at all the tech leaders who are suddenly coming around to the Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that federal regulators continue to evenhandedly apply competition, consumer protection, anti-discrimination laws and any other rule or law that applies to your company, But the industry\u2019s efforts suggest that Big Tech companies are trying to curry favor and skirt the rules,\u201d the senators write."

            "article_content": "Significant progress has been made in machine learning with large amounts of clean labels and static data. However, in many real-world applications, the data often changes with time and it is class-imbalanced and difficult to obtain massive clean annotations, that is, noisy labels, class-imbalanced problems, and time series are faced simultaneously.\n\nTo solve the problems, a research team led by Yu-Feng LI published their new research on 15 December 2024 in Frontiers of Computer Science co-published by Higher Education Press and Springer Nature.\n\nThe team proposed a framework called RTS for robust learning from time series with noisy labels. This framework is designed for time series data and has the capability to simultaneously mitigate the problems of imbalanced and noisy labels without prior knowledge of the noise transition matrix. Extensive experiments on real-world applications and benchmarks, as well as theoretical analysis, clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of RTS.\n\nIn the research, they analyze the two challenges of learning from time series data with noisy labels: (a) Label noise in time series data misleads the learning process of feature representations, making the representations unreliable; (b) Samples of minority classes are insufficient and assigned with incorrect labels, leading to degraded performance in minority classes. To address the above challenges, they propose a novel framework RTS, which consists of two modules: Noise-tolerant Time Series Representation and Purified Oversampling Learning.\n\nFirstly, the noise-tolerant time series representation module attempts to fully exploit noisy supervision so that the model can obtain robust feature representations and distinguish clean samples. It integrates the label smoothing technique and small-loss criterion to learn reliable feature representations and thereby accurately identify clean samples. Further, a novel oversampling for time series is developed to train an unbiased model for balancing and augmenting this dataset. They also give a theoretical analysis shedding light on the feasibility of their proposal. Empirical experiments on diverse tasks, such as the house-buyer evaluation task from real-world applications and various benchmark tasks, clearly demonstrate that RTS outperforms competitive methods.\n\nFuture work can focus on designing robust time-series learning methods that can handle more realistic noise and introducing more advanced model architectures into the RTS.\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s11704-023-3200-z"

Putin of Russia, his hostility toward Ukraine and his resistance to U.S. military aid to Kyiv, analysts expect any settlement he seeks to be favorable to Moscow. Vice President-elect JD Vance has suggested letting Russia keep the 20 percent of Ukraine it has illegally seized through aggression and forcing Ukraine to accept neutrality rather than alignment with the West, a framework echoing Russian priorities.\n\nAsked by email why Mr. Trump had not fulfilled his campaign promise to end the war before his inauguration, Karoline Leavitt, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming White House press secretary, did not respond directly, but instead repeated that he will make it \u201ca top priority in his second term.\u201d\n\nSince his November election, Mr. Trump met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and has spoken about meeting with Mr. Putin after his inauguration."

            "article_content": "A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip came into effect on Sunday, following a delay of nearly three hours. The truce halts a devastating 15-month-long conflict that has caused widespread destruction and loss of life. After months of intricate and tense negotiations, the agreement aims to provide a reprieve from the violence that has gripped the region, while addressing the political and humanitarian crises exacerbated by the ongoing war.\n\nDespite the delayed start, residents and medical workers in Gaza reported no new fighting or military strikes after about 30 minutes before the ceasefire was implemented. However, Israeli airstrikes and artillery attacks killed 13 Palestinians in Gaza between 06:30 GMT, when the ceasefire was originally set to begin, and 09:15 GMT, when it was finally enacted, according to Palestinian medics.\n\n#WATCH | Delhi | Reuven Azar, Israeli Ambassador to India, says, \"The ceasefire Israel signed off to is the first phase of a gradual deal which has the potential of bringing back our hostages and also making sure Hamas won't be ever able to massacre Israelis like it did on\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fBZwWi7jNP Also Read Air Canada plane catches fire during landing at Halifax airport, incident happens hours after fatal South Korea plane tragedy \u2013 Watch \u2018IITian Baba\u2019 Abhey Singh expelled from Juna Akhara for disrespecting his guru; he responds Indian Railways\u2019 expansion in West Bengal: 43 rail projects spanning 4,479 km underway in the state, says Ashwini Vaishnaw FPIs turn net sellers after two weeks of buying, withdraw Rs 976 crore amid global uncertainty January 19, 2025\n\nReasons for the Delay\n\nIsrael\u2019s military blamed Hamas for the delay, citing the Palestinian militant group\u2019s failure to provide a list of hostages to be released as part of the agreement. Hamas attributed the delay to \u201ctechnical\u201d reasons, though it did not elaborate further. A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated that the delay was due to mediators requesting 48 hours of \u201ccalm\u201d before the ceasefire, but Israeli strikes had made it difficult to send the list of names.\n\nAlso Read Israeli PM Netanyahu delays Gaza ceasefire until Hamas releases hostage list\n\nTwo hours after the deadline, Hamas announced that it had sent the names of the hostages to be released, with Israeli officials confirming the receipt. The three hostages named for release on Sunday were Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher, and Emily Damari, although Israel did not immediately confirm their identities.\n\nDetails of the Ceasefire Agreement\n\nThe ceasefire deal follows months of on-again, off-again negotiations, involving mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and the United States. The deal, which is seen as a potential step toward ending the Gaza war, is structured in three stages. The first stage will last six weeks and will involve the release of 33 of the remaining 98 hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe first hostages to be released will include women, children, and the elderly, and they are expected to be transferred through the Red Cross. In return for each of the hostages released, Israel will free 30 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas will coordinate with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to determine the meeting points inside Gaza for the handover.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement, though a step forward, does not yet guarantee a full resolution to the conflict. The ongoing war, which erupted after Hamas launched attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, has claimed thousands of lives, with nearly 47,000 Palestinians killed in the conflict. The war has also exacerbated tensions throughout the Middle East, drawing in Iranian-backed militant groups and causing diplomatic isolation for Israel.\n\n(With Reuters Inputs)"

            "article_content": "Adani Energy Solutions Ltd, India's largest electricity transmission and distribution company, has won two new transmission projects, helping swell its order book to \u20b954,700 crore -- more than three times of the work order it had at the start of current fiscal in April 2024.\n\nIn October-December 2024 -- the third quarter of the fiscal year April 2024 to March 2025 (FY25), AESL won two new transmission projects worth \u20b928,455 crore in Rajasthan, related to the renewable energy park, Jefferies said in a report.\n\nThe orders include the \u20b925,000-crore Bhadla-Fatehpur HVDC project, which is AESL's largest order win till date.\n\nThese order wins have pushed up the company's market share in TBCB (tariff-based competitive bidding) orders to 24 per cent, from 17 per cent in the second quarter.\n\nAESL's current order book now stands at \u20b954,700 crore, as compared to \u20b917,000 crore in the beginning of the current financial year. This is the highest order book amongst all private sector transmission companies.\n\nAlso read: ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel to commission 2 million tonne auto grade steel capacity by March\n\nDuring the quarter, the company commissioned one transmission line, adding over 1000 circuit kilometres to its network, which stands at 26,485 cKM and 84,286 MVA of transformation capacity. As of December 2023, these were 20,422 cKM and 54,661 MVA.\n\nIn distribution, the company supplies power to over 3 million customers in Mumbai metropolitan and Mundra SEZ regions. During the quarter, Mumbai market saw a 3 per cent year-on-year increase in power sale to 2.57 billion units, while the Mundra market saw a 30 per cent rise to 236 million units.\n\nThe company has applied for a parallel distribution license in Navi Mumbai, Kutch, and Ghaziabad-Jewar-Bulandshahr area.\n\n\"We believe AESL should see 16 per cent revenue CAGR and 62 per cent profit CAGR in FY24-27E, driven by locked-in growth in both transmission and distribution business,\" Jefferies said. \"\u20b927,300 crore projects are targeted to be commissioned by October 2026\".\n\nIn smart metering, AESL was the lowest bidder in the cancelled smart metering tender of 8.2 million meters in Tamil Nadu. This order quantity is not part of AESL's existing pipeline of 22.8 million meters.\n\nAESL said it will participate in the rebidding when it comes up.\n\nJefferies expects AESL to add 4.5 million smart meters by the end FY25 and 10 million by FY26, of which 7 million will come from existing contracts and balance from new wins.\n\nAESL's capital management program prioritises reducing volatility in interest costs through long-tenure bonds. The company is also refining its debt management strategy to match the life of respective assets at fixed rates as much as possible.\n\n\"AESL's management says it believes in minimising volatility in its asset base across parameters: debt is being refinanced and raised to match the life of the respective asset at a fixed rate as far as possible; vendor back-to-back arrangements to limit the impact of commodity price changes; and land studies for faster project commissioning,\" the report said, adding downside risks include inability to maintain interest rate; and market share loss."

Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations far beyond the capabilities of traditional computers.\n\nThis transformative technology has the potential to revolutionize diverse sectors, including medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence (AI). Underscoring this point, a recent McKinsey & Co. research report projects that quantum computing could generate a whopping $1.3 trillion in economic value by 2035.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nA swirling, colorful, abstract image representing the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nJust as the internet boom created giants like Amazon and Google, quantum computing could give rise to a new generation of industry-leading companies, offering early investors the potential for extraordinary gains. Imagine a future with personalized medicines, revolutionary materials, and supercharged AI -- all made possible by quantum computing.\n\nLet's take a closer look at two quantum computing stocks that could represent once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for early shareholders.\n\nTrapped-ion quantum computing leader\n\nIonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is emerging as a potential leader in the commercialization of quantum computing through its trapped-ion technology approach. Unlike traditional superconducting quantum competitors, IonQ's architecture operates at room temperature and demonstrates strong qubit connectivity, with the company's Forte system delivering 36 algorithmic qubits at 99.9% fidelity -- marking significant performance advantages that could translate into a formidable competitive moat as the technology matures.\n\nWhile some quantum computing companies focus on the number of physical qubits, IonQ uses \"algorithmic qubits\" to represent the computational power available after accounting for error correction and other factors that affect algorithm performance. This metric aims to provide a more practical measure of a quantum computer's ability to solve real-world problems.\n\nBeyond the core technology, IonQ's execution has been notable. The company has consistently beaten aggressive roadmap timelines, secured a major $54.5M Air Force Research Lab contract, and established partnerships with heavyweights like pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and engineering simulation software leader Ansys.\n\nWhile quantum computing stocks are notoriously speculative, IonQ's manufacturing facility opening and modular multicore architecture as a potential path to scaling suggest the company has a credible shot at capturing a meaningful share of the vast and potentially unparalleled quantum computing market.\n\nSuperconducting quantum pioneer\n\nRigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) takes a distinctive approach to quantum computing, focusing on superconducting technology and vertical integration. Unlike room-temperature trapped-ion systems, Rigetti's architecture leverages established semiconductor manufacturing processes at the company's dedicated Fab-1 quantum foundry, potentially offering advantages in scaling and gate speeds in the years ahead.\n\nWhile qubit count is one progress metric, Rigetti emphasizes gate fidelity as a key performance metric. The company's latest Ankaa-3 system achieves 99% median iSWAP gate fidelity and 99.5% median fidelity for fSim gates -- critical benchmarks that reflect the system's ability to perform reliable quantum operations with minimal errors, which is necessary for practical applications.\n\nBeyond the technical foundations, Rigetti's execution showcases strategic positioning. The company has secured its role as the quantum hardware provider for the U.K.'s National Quantum Computing Centre, established partnerships with financial leaders like HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, and maintains strong ties with the Air Force Research Lab and Fermilab's SQMS Center.\n\nWhile quantum computing remains an emerging field with significant technological hurdles, including maintaining qubit coherence, Rigetti's full-stack approach and innovative multichip architecture, combined with flexible deployment options through major cloud platforms and the QCS Direct cloud service, suggest the company is well positioned to compete in the evolving quantum computing landscape.\n\nA quantum computing revolution\n\nAs quantum computing advances from research labs toward commercial reality, IonQ and Rigetti demonstrate the potential technological paths that could make quantum computing a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity. Each company combines innovative architectures with strategic partnerships and clear commercialization strategies that could provide paths to capturing market share.\n\nWhile the technology remains highly speculative and faces significant technical hurdles, companies that successfully scale their systems while maintaining high performance could deliver unprecedented returns. As these potential quantum leaders emerge, investors must monitor technical progress, partnership momentum, and execution against stated roadmaps.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

            "article_content": "Scientists have claimed that an interstellar visitor, much larger than any celestial body in our solar system, might have dramatically altered the orbits of the planets. The research, yet to be peer-reviewed but published in the arXiv preprint database, posits that this cosmic intruder, possibly eight times the mass of Jupiter, passed very close to where Mars orbits today, potentially affecting the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\nFor a long time, scientists have stated that in ideal conditions, the planets should have lied in circles that are arranged concentrically around the Sun and in the same plane -- meaning if you viewed them edge-on, you would only see a line. However, since planets orbit the Sun in different orbits in three-dimensional space, it makes it almost impossible for them to come together in a straight line.\n\nTo understand the discrepancy, the researchers considered a scenario around four billion years ago when a star-sized alien object, whizzed around in our solar system. They ran extensive simulations through 50,000 scenarios, each spanning 20 million years while adjusting various parameters like the visitor's mass, speed, and closest approach to the sun.\n\nThese simulations indicated that in about one per cent of the cases, this cosmic guest could have reshaped the orbits of these planets to match what we observe today.\n\n\"We estimate that there is about a 1-in-100 chance that such a flyby produces a dynamical architecture similar to that of the solar system,\" the study highlighted.\n\nAlso Read | Seven Planets To Align During Rare Celestial Event. When And How To Watch\n\nStudy results\n\nThe findings showed that the interstellar object might have come within 1.69 astronomical units (AU) of the Sun, which is just beyond Mars' current orbit. An astronomical unit is roughly the distance from Earth to the Sun. This proximity would have been close enough for the visitor's gravity to tug on our planets, nudging them into new paths.\n\n\"The scenario of a close encounter with a substellar object offers a plausible explanation for the origin of the moderate eccentricities and inclinations and the secular architecture of the planets.\"\n\nPrevious theories suggested that the orbits may have been reshaped due to planetary interactions within the solar system. However, the new study challenges this belief and argues that a one-off event could explain these irregularities.\n\nThe scientists added that further exploration of this scenario was needed which might detail the \"effect of substellar flybys on the dynamical excitation of minor planets in the asteroid belt and the trans-Neptunian belts\"."

            "article_content": "Fundamental research in cryptography that\u2019s used worldwide to facilitate internet banking, e-commerce services, and secure messaging systems is now taking root in India as well.\n\nThe principal goal of those developing or using cryptographic systems is to improve system security. Cryptography \u2014 from the English roots of \u201chidden writing \u2014 is the name for techniques that secure information by converting plain text into ciphertext. It is concerned with the creation and use of encrypted messages that only the sender and the receiver can understand and which a malicious actor who interferes with the communication can\u2019t.\n\nSending secret messages isn\u2019t new. Archaeologists have unearthed clay tablets made by the ancient Mesopotamians in which they wrote down cryptic formulae to make ceramic glazes. In the first century BC, the Roman dictator Julius Caesar used the eponymous Caesar cipher to relay messages of strategic value to his generals.\n\nMore recently, many Polish codebreakers fled their country after Adolf Hitler invaded it in 1939 to work with reputed British mathematicians, including the father of modern computing Alan Turing, to crack Germany\u2019s famed Enigma cryptosystem. Turing\u2019s work in particular established much of the foundational theory for modern algorithmic computing.\n\nScientists have devised many sophisticated methods to prevent adversaries from cracking secret codes and gaining unauthorised access to sensitive information. These methods achieve their goals by using algorithms and protocols to protect some data\u2019s confidentiality, integrity, authenticatability, and non-repudiation.\n\n\u2018Hard\u2019 problems\n\nCryptographic algorithms convert messages in ways that make it very difficult, very expensive or both to decode them. A common way to achieve this has been to place some sensitive information behind the answer to a very difficult problem. An agent can access the information by solving the problem, so the harder the problem, the more inaccessible the information.\n\n\u201cHence the search for harder and harder problems \u2014 for instance, even those that quantum computers may find hard to solve,\u201d R. Ramanujam of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, said.\n\nAs computational techniques evolve, particularly with advancements in quantum computing, the interplay between complexity and cryptography will continue to be a crucial area of research and development, he added.\n\nModern cryptographic systems are built on problems that demand far too many resources to be solved.\n\n\u201cAs they say in the crypto community, if your cryptosystem is broken, either a spy is dead or a million dollars is missing,\u201d Ayan Mukherjee, an assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, said. \u201cSuch is the seriousness of the effect of a broken cryptosystem. Thus, oftentimes, people use the old and the trusted to secure their communications.\u201d\n\nThis is also why, he added, \u201cThe field of cryptography is very slow-moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a close connection between complexity theory and cryptography, hence many [researchers] work on these connections, clarifying notions and building finer techniques,\u201d Ramanujam said.\n\nAreas where Indian researchers are working extensively include communication complexity (the amount of communication required to complete a computational task), proof complexity (the computational resources required to prove or disprove statements), and algebraic coding theory (using algebra to encode and decode data).\n\nLocks and keys\n\nThe goal is to make sure an adversary, especially one with enormous computational resources, can\u2019t crack the code. At the heart of any cryptosystem is the key: a secret value an algorithm uses to encrypt or decrypt data.\n\nThe Caesar cipher is a simple example. It works by mapping the existing alphabet to one where the starting letter is offset by some number of letters. This number is the key. For example, if the key is 14, the encrypted alphabet begins with the letter O (the 14th letter) rather than A. Thus the words FIGHT FOR ROME become TWUVH TCF FCAS.\n\nWhen the sender encrypts data with a key, only someone who knows the key can decrypt the message and read it. More sophisticated systems use two keys \u2014 one each for the sender and the receiver \u2014 and map them in a separate secret way.\n\nA famous example is public-key cryptography, which is used to secure information over the internet. The receiver uses a single algorithm to generate two keys called the public key and the private key, and shares the public key with the sender. Any message the sender encrypts with the public key can be decrypted by the private key.\n\nResearchers prefer the algorithms that generate keys to be one-way functions, a name in mathematics for functions that are simple to use but hard to crack. In cryptography, this means they can be used to easily encrypt messages but can\u2019t be cracked without knowing the key. As Ramanujam put it, the challenge is like protecting a house with a strong alarm system that the house\u2019s residents can still use without training.\n\nSome one-way functions are very difficult to crack and thus very secure \u2014 but which also take a long time to decrypt messages. This is one of the principal reasons mining for bitcoins has become a very energy-intensive process. The bitcoin system uses a one-way function that has required more computational resources to decrypt messages as the size of its blockchain has increased.\n\nThis is why some cryptography researchers in India and abroad are working on simplifying the decryption side in particular. Researchers are also considering whether shorter proofs (of the hard problems) can be used to verify the integrity of data in artificial intelligence and large language models.\n\nCryptography isn\u2019t just a mathematical or academic curiosity but is of considerable practical interest, Yael Kalai, whose work on proofs won her the 2022 Turing Award, told the 11th Heidelberg Laureate Forum in September (the author was in the audience). \u201cIn today\u2019s world, the biggest problem we have to solve is trustworthiness,\u201d she said.\n\nSince researchers have solved the problem of authentication and security in communications, she added, the current problem is computation.\n\n\u201cPeople are computing things for us. How do we know that they are computing correctly? How do we certify the huge and often crazy computations people are coming up with? That is a huge new research problem now.\u201d\n\nPossibility of disruption\n\nTwo research areas that could disrupt current cryptographic systems with significant economic and social consequences are homomorphic encryption and quantum information technologies, per a recent paper by the Organisation of Economically Developed Countries (OECD).\n\nHomomorphic encryption is a cryptographic method that allows certain calculations to be performed on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first and without accessing the secret key. The result of such computations remains in encrypted form and can be revealed later, when necessary. According to the paper, this technique could surmount the problem of processing encrypted data without decrypting it first, which increases risk.\n\nSecond, a mature quantum computer could easily break some encryption methods widely used today. Some researchers are thus working on algorithms that can resist attacks powered by a quantum computer, an enterprise called quantum resistant cryptography (QRC). In fact marrying cryptography with quantum physics paves the way for encryption technologies based on the laws of quantum physics, which can be more convoluted than mathematical concepts alone.\n\nResearchers worldwide have been working on QRC since 2006, including in publicly funded research projects in the European Union and Japan. In India, Mukherjee\u2019s group at IISER Pune, and those at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the Raman Research Institute (RRI), both in Bengaluru; the Centre for Development of Telematics, New Delhi; and at Pondicherry University are working on it as well.\n\n\u2018A huge deal\u2019\n\nCryptography research in India is taking off in other aspects, too, catching up with that in the European Union, the U.S., and China. The National Quantum Mission the Cabinet approved in 2023 includes a research hub for quantum communication. The mission is to enable satellite-based secure quantum communications between ground stations over 2,000 km, long-distance secure quantum communications with other countries, inter-city quantum key distribution over 2,000 km, and multi-node quantum networks, among other outcomes.\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation is also planning to launch a satellite with ultra-secure quantum communication capabilities.\n\nIn July, a team of Indian scientists from RRI, IISc, IISER Thiruvananthapuram, and the Bose Institute in Kolkata published a paper describing a way to generate true random numbers that are crucial to making secure private keys and nearly unhackable passwords.\n\n\u201cThis new method offers the enhanced protection we all need in our daily lives, by using truly random numbers to generate keys that will be used to encrypt the passwords,\u201d the Department of Science & Technology said in a statement.\n\nApart from the Ministry of Science & Technology, major government funders for cryptography research in the country include the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Department of Telecommunications.\n\n\u201cThe present status of quantum cryptography is to build quantum-secure cryptosystems,\u201d Mukherjee said. \u201cIt\u2019s based on the idea that, in the near future, we will have quantum computers. When that happens the current cryptosystems will fail. This is a huge deal.\u201d\n\nThe consequences will also affect India\u2019s cryptography policy. According to a recent study commissioned by the Thales Group, the volume of sensitive data in the cloud could surge from 51% of all organisational data to 68% by 2027. As more data enters and lives in the cloud, \u201cencryption techniques for data at rest, in motion, and in use are becoming more pervasive, evolving into a standard practice for protecting cloud-resident sensitive information against emerging cyber threats,\u201d the report said.\n\nThere is widespread data loss as well: the report said almost three-fourths of all organisations have faced multiple data breaches in the past year, foremost due to inadequate encryption. Some 71% initiated formal cryptographic programmes and 81% have dedicated encryption teams.\n\nT.V. Padma is a science journalist in New Delhi."

            "article_content": "Mechanisation in the agricultural sector contributed to improved global food supply and security. File Pic\n\nEVERY stage of industrial revolution in the history of the world has been characterised by both excitement and fears. As the world enters a new phase of industrial revolution, the same sense of mixed feelings is gripping the world.\n\nThe excitement lies in that every stage of the industrial revolution has ushered in massive levels of efficiency which have improved production, spruced up economic growth and thus improving the quality of life for many. The world is what it is today because of the different industrial revolutions.\n\nWhile on other hand, there has been fears that each stage of industrial revolution will render millions of people jobless and cause environmental damage due to the demands of technology in use. The first phases of industrial revolutions contributed massively to deforestation due to logging, mining and agriculture. This deforestation threatened environmental sustainability and contributed to climate change. Mother earth is bleeding today because of the damage caused by the use of carbon gasses.\n\nThe first industrial revolution occurred between the 18th to 19th centuries in Europe and North America largely focusing on the agrarian sector enabling rural farming communities to turn industrial and urban. Mechanisation in the agricultural sector contributed to improved global food supply and security.\n\nThe iron and textile industries, along with the development of the water wheel and then the steam engine, played central roles in the industrial revolution. Available literature shows that job losses were only short-term as the mechanisation boom created new jobs that did not previously exist.\n\nThe second industrial revolution which occurred from 1870 to the period preceding the First World War in 1914 were characterised by two industrial phenomena. First was the improvement of the existing mechanisation technology leading to mass production of goods.\n\nAnd second, it was the invention of major technology such as the telephone, light bulb, music and sound recording and the internal combustion engine. The transitions from steam engines to electrical energy might have ejected a few people from their jobs but again, the industrialisation boom meant that these too would be absorbed into the new job markets.\n\nThe third and the fourth industrial revolutions were characterised by digitalisation and how technology became embedded within societies and their cultures.\n\nIt was dominated by the computer revolution as well as widespread internet connectivity enabling the world to be more globalised.\n\nGlobalisation increased interdependence and integration among and between countries' economies, markets, societies and cultures. It was driven by the exchange of goods, services, capital, people and information across borders. This created new trading opportunities, improved connectivity, movement of supplies and travelling. The outcome of this was massive economic growth as well as new job and economic opportunities.\n\nThe fifth industrial revolution which focuses on human-centredness, sustainability and concern for the environment has triggered similar mixed feelings. On the positive side, there is a push to embrace artificial intelligence and big data science which is seen as another advancement in human development as it is set to improve how the world conducts business.\n\nAnalysts have allayed the fears of possible job loses due to the rise of artificial intelligence-driven automation. A report from the World Economic Forum noted that while the growth and expansion of artificial intelligence and robots may push more than 80 million jobs out of the market, it is also projected that this new technology will create nearly 100 million new roles in areas like artificial intelligence, data science and human-AI collaboration.\n\nThe common trend in all these different phases of industrial revolution is the world\u2019s ability to embrace and adjust to the new industrialisation realities while ensuring that no one is left behind. Instead of focusing on job losses, perhaps it is maybe vital to pay more attention to how the new technology will impact other aspects of our lives such as the environment.\n\nAlready some countries are still struggling to dispose of old computers and other technology gadgets. While the world is still grappling with that challenge, latest reports indicate that artificial intelligence consumes huge amounts of water to cool the data centres that power them.\n\nThis water consumption is a growing concern because it can strain water supplies and contribute to environmental issues. Latest research has shown that writing a 100-word email using artificial intelligence applications consumes more than half a litre of water. In 2022, one of the world\u2019s major internet search engines data centres used over 21 billion litres of potable water and that was a 20% increase from 2021.\n\nThat is both colossal and unsustainable and calls for more pressure on the technology industry to finds ways of reducing water consumption to keep their servers running. Once artificial intelligence starts to power economic growth and integrates with human life, it will be as complicated to address the water issue, just as much as it is to cut carbon emissions.\n\nThis is not the first time that phases of industrial revolution have threatened the environment. The current climate change is thought to be a result of an increase in carbon emissions. As greenhouse gas emissions blanket the earth, they trap the sun\u2019s heat. This leads to global warming and climate change. The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history. If carbon caused global warming, artificial intelligence may cause the drying up of water sources if no solution is sought."

            "article_content": "Donald Trump ought to be com\u00adical, surely? He\u2019s too big, too brash, too \u201cgrab-\u2019em-by-the-pussy\u201d to be taken entirely seriously. He accuses whole peoples of criminal intent. He goes on about wind turbines and whales. But however hard Nice People mock him, nothing seems to stick; so much so that on Monday he\u2019ll be inaugurated for a second term as President of the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s not that his many haters in the media don\u2019t try. The current-affairs comedy show Saturday Night Live \u2013 a staple of US broadcasting since the 1970s and the subject of a new, ironically unfunny, movie called Saturday Night \u2013 has featured Trump parodies since the 1980s. But more recently, the barbs have not been hitting home. Though reports of the show\u2019s declining viewership are complicated by the proliferation of viewing options since the 1990s, its former power to define mainstream humour is no longer unassailable. Too many find Trump\u2019s own utterances, often disseminated on social media, more memorable than those of his detractors: he has been jokingly hailed as \u201cthe Shakespeare of posting\u201d, a coiner of quirky phrases that, like lines from the Bard, creep into everyday language. Mine is surely not the only kitchen in the world with a jar labelled \u201cCovfefe\u201d.\n\nWhat explains his apparent immunity to mockery? One superficially plausible theory is that it\u2019s because Trump positions himself as a plucky underdog, with the \u201cfake-news media\u201d arrayed against him. This, at least to Trump fans, makes his detractors look like sneer\u00ading patricians rather than righteous resistance. Progressives are fond of claiming that mockery isn\u2019t funny or effective unless it\u2019s \u201cpunching up\u201d: that is, lampooning a figure or group with greater clout than the lampooner. And yet much of the legacy press, broadcasting, and Holly\u00adwood inclines broadly to the Left. In effect, then, we might argue that the reason Trump satire falls flat is because it\u2019s not \u201cpunching up\u201d.\n\nBut while this asymmetry of voice and credibility is \u00adarguably true of Left and Right overall, it maps only tenuously onto Trump himself \u2013 now a billionaire \u00adpresident-elect, with one term in the White House already under his belt. And pundits who go too far in attacking him are not protected by progressive cred\u00adentials. When, for example, the comic Kathy Griffin posted a photo of herself on \u00adTwitter in 2017, holding what appeared to be Trump\u2019s bloody, severed head, she claimed, \u201cI\u2019m merely mocking the Mocker in Chief.\u201d The backlash saw her fired from CNN, while Griffin herself claimed to have been blacklisted in Hollywood and put on a no-fly list. It would take an exceptionally partisan observer to deny who had the real clout there.\n\nSo, no: it\u2019s not just that Trump is some kind of underdog, and \u201cthe libs are punching down\u201d. Could it be, then, that he is just too \u201cextra\u201d to be caricatured? It is, after all, diffi\u00adcult to mock a political leader for bending the truth when, as a salesman and dealmaker, he knows that doing so gets results. It\u2019s similarly fut\u00adile to caricature him as a coarse, flashy man of prodigious appet\u00adites. He is all these things, but not remotely embarrassed about it: a thrice-married, philandering father of five, known for living in a golden tower and regularly washing down two Big Macs and two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches with a chocolate-malt milkshake."
