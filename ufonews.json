            "article_content": "New Delhi: India\u2019s technology sector is likely to see generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) and related data applications define client orders, financial growth and technical innovation in 2025. In turn, this is expected to generate a spurt in demand for data centres and their services.\n\nIndustry stakeholders ranging from the US\u2019s Big Tech firms, as well as data centre and software services companies, are gearing up for a boom in demand amid expectations of easing inflation concerns in the West, and the Indian government\u2019s boost to domestic research and development (R&D) expenditure in the coming year.\n\nOn 12 December, Mint reported that the Centre was evaluating plans to roll out $3 billion in incentives to boost R&D in India. The country, already a hub for fresh technical talent, is now looking to invest in innovation to climb up the value ladder\u2014as opposed to being a usage economy so far.\n\nAlso read | The next great leap in AI is behind schedule and crazy expensive\n\nAt the core of this push is the establishment of generative AI as a key differentiator in the near term, and its impact on data centres.\n\nOn 28 September, Mint reported that the Adani group is likely to pump in $4 billion to establish a net data centre capacity of 1.5GW (gigawatt) within the next two years, a plan that originally had a timeline of five years. This boost is driven by the influx of AI in enterprises, and the anticipated data boom that is expected to come with it.\n\nAshish Arora, chief executive of Bharti Enterprises\u2019 subsidiary Nxtra, also added that the company is investing $600 million to double its net data centre capacity to 400MW (megawatt) by 2026, a chunk of which will be expanded in 2025 itself.\n\nEarlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Yotta Data Services, a subsidiary of the Hiranandani Group, is close to finalizing a $500-million investment through a group of creditors to expand its data centre \u2018parks\u2019, which are already operational in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Greater Noida and Maharashtra\u2019s Navi Mumbai regions.\n\nThe uptick comes even as generative AI has struggled to keep up with its heightened hype of rapidly transforming businesses. Driven by data privacy and copyright concerns, enterprises have largely remained cautious in adopting the technology rapidly through this year.\n\nAlso read | How scammers are using AI this holiday season to steal your money\n\nThe early signs of change, however, are here. On 19 December, Accenture, the world\u2019s largest technology services outsourcing and consultancy firm and a bellwether for India\u2019s $300-billion IT services sector, disclosed $1.2 billion in net new generative AI deals with businesses worldwide. generative AI, thus, comprised 6.4% of total new business during the company\u2019s Q1FY25 period, which in its reporting runs from September to November.\n\nThe first week of January, thus, will be key to see if India\u2019s IT services stalwarts, led by heavyweights Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and HCL Technologies, can keep up with Accenture\u2019s pace of executing generative AI applications with clients.\n\nEarlier this fiscal, K. Krithivasan, chief executive of TCS, had said that the company has a business pipeline worth $1.5 billion for generative AI. During the company\u2019s October earnings call for Q2FY25, Krithivasan further added that the company has 600 active generative AI projects. However, crucially, he declined to comment on the amount of revenue TCS is drawing from AI\u2019s youngest brainchild.\n\nAdoption likely to rise\n\nIndustry stakeholders, however, are bullish that 2025 is likely to see generative AI go on a stronger run of adoption, as the technology itself becomes more mature, and businesses find a way to implement them at the core.\n\nOn 11 December, Google announced its new generation of generative AI models under the Gemini 2.0 suite, underlining its suitability for \u2018agentic\u2019 AI applications, which experts said was a clear sign of the company trying to convince businesses of the technology\u2019s usability.\n\n\u201cAI isn\u2019t just an enabler anymore\u2014it\u2019s becoming the backbone of how industries innovate, scale, and solve their most complex challenges,\" said Sindhu Gangadharan, chairperson of Centre-affiliated think-tank Nasscom, and managing director of SAP Labs India. \u201cAI is evolving from being assistive to becoming truly intelligent, with autonomous agents capable of making decisions and orchestrating entire ecosystems.\n\nGangadharan added that custom AI, in particular, is emerging as a transformative force in 2025, allowing organizations to design AI solutions tailored to their specific needs. \u201cThis trend is set to democratize AI innovation. For India, this is an incredible opportunity\u2014we\u2019re perfectly positioned to lead this AI-driven transformation,\" she said.\n\n\u201cMore organizations are experimenting with building custom AI solutions tailored to industry needs, including custom copilots and AI agents,\" said Irina Ghose, managing director of Microsoft India. She added that Indian enterprises are at the forefront of this shift in scaling AI and data use cases to \u201cdrive innovation, improve productivity and streamline workflows\u2014bringing India on the brink of an AI-driven renaissance\".\n\nAlso read | The AI robots on their way will mostly be made in Asia\n\nGhose further added that as far as generative AI is concerned, there is no doubt that with the right combination of data and associated computing power, businesses across industries can be considerably redefined.\n\n\"2024 was the year of AI in action, and we saw a transformative shift in how companies approach AI, moving from exploration to execution. Increasingly, more and more organizations are experimenting with building custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs, including custom copilots and AI agents. The business opportunity of AI is clear. According to an IDC study, for every dollar a company invests in generative AI, the return on investment is 3.7x. On top of this, 92% of AI deployments are taking 12 months or less at an enterprise level,\" Ghose said.\n\nIpsita Dasgupta, managing director of HP India, said it was important to empower SMBs (small and medium businesses), which contribute about 30% of GDP but face various barriers, with AI technology. \u201cThe future of work means a more flexible, inclusive and digitally connected environment where technology empowers individuals and businesses of all sizes. AI PCs and advanced workstations will be at the core of this change,\" Dasgupta said.\n\nThe key, experts believe, will be in how generative AI grows in the coming year. Pointing out that generative AI is still only a two-year old technology, Jayanth Kolla, partner at tech consultant Convergence Catalyst, said we are still understanding a lot about it.\n\n\u201cThat said, the advent of domain-specific applications through generative AI is a key area of business interest, and whichever way you look at it, the boom in data centre demand is unavoidable in India as a result. As enterprises ramp up AI consumption, this demand will only rise, without any concerns of slowdown or saturation at least in the near-term,\" Kolla said.\n\nThere are also new directions that AI and data centre evolutions can take in the coming year. For AI, much will depend on what the US behemoths of Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI will do in the coming year. 2024 already saw reasoning AI make a debut, although the use cases of the latter will only build over time. For data centres, figuring out the energy consumption conundrum will be key, as net-zero and climate change accord targets inch closer.\n\nThe earliest proof of the generative AI pudding, each stakeholder agrees, is likely going to come in the first quarter of the upcoming fiscal\u2014suggesting that the true boom in AI and data centres could take until at least the middle of the year to play out. Despite that, all of them are certain that unlike the promise of 5G or satellite internet, there are no external factors that can stop 2025 from being the year for data centres and generative AI to define India\u2019s tech industries."

Our data shows that, yes, there are instances like that of course, but there are many other cases that are evidential.\n\n\"For example, being witnessed by more than one person, or these crisis cases where they didn't even know the person was dead.\n\n\"Across the board, these stories are often coming from very highly educated people with very good jobs, and not everybody's bereaved.\"\n\n'The paranormal is normal'\n\nA 2023 paper by J.K.Penberthy and others, in collaboration with the University of Northampton, discovered that 27 per cent of research participants who had ADC experiences identified as not being in a state of grieving or mourning.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, electrical phenomena in ADCs has massively increased over the years, too, presumably due to the growing number of devices the average person uses now.\n\n\"If we\u2019re to believe that the deceased live on somewhere, then they are seemingly more and more able to affect electronics and phones,\" Sophie says.\n\n\"I\u2019ve had evidence of things like, 'My deceased husband sends me text messages every week', 'I\u2019ve had a voicemail from my brother after he passed on', and switched-off iPads suddenly playing the departed\u2019s favourite song.\n\n\"Physical phenomena is very common.\"\n\nThe beliefs of Brits AROUND half (46 per cent) of Brits believe in life after death, according to a study by Kings College London. Gen Z (51 per cent) and Millenials (53 per cent) have the highest rates of belief. But the share of the British public who identify as religious has halved since the 1980s. The UK public are now among the least likely internationally to believe in God. Just under half (49 per cent) of Brits said they believed in God in 2022 \u2013 down from three-quarters (75 per cent) in 1981. Of 24 nations in the study, only five are now less likely than the UK to say they believe in God, with China (17 per cent) by far the least likely to. And the share of the British public who say God is not important in their life has doubled and is now at a record high, rising from 28 per cent to 57 per cent between 1981 and 2022. Between 1981 and 2022, the share of the public believing in heaven fell from 57 per cent to 41 per cent. Despite this, the idea of heaven is still more popular than hell, which 26 per cent said they believed in in 2022 \u2013 a figure largely unchanged since trends began. While younger people have lower levels of religious belief and are more likely to identify as atheists, Gen Z (32 per cent) and Millennials (32 per cent) are in fact more likely than Baby Boomers (18 per cent) and the Pre-War generation (24 per cent) to believe in hell. And by international standards, the UK is less likely to believe in hell, ranking 17th out of 24 countries \u2013 and far behind some peer nations such as the US (69 per cent) and Italy (39 per cent). Views on life after death have held up well over the last four decades, with just under half of the public \u2013 including 46 per cent in 2022 \u2013 consistently saying they believe in it, the study found.\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to prove that there really is life after death, Sophie says it\u2019s the impact of these experiences on the grieving process that is really important.\n\nThe ADC questionnaire has shown that the majority found the ADCs comforting (81 per cent) and helpful in their bereavement (84 per cent).\n\nOnly 12 per cent of respondents in the study reported their ADC as frightening.\n\n\"The main aim of this work is to show the public that the paranormal is normal,\" she adds.\n\n\"And these experiences can have positive psychological effects.\n\n\"Real or not, these experiences mean the world to people who have them.\n\n\"Neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud described sensing the presence of the deceased as \u2018hallucinatory wishful psychosis\u2019, and he advised we cut emotional attachment to deceased loved ones.\n\n\"Well, now there are quite a lot of studies proving that being open to a connection with a deceased loved one is really beneficial to the grieving process and mental health.\"\n\nAnother key impact of an ADC is of course a new belief in life after death, something 92.8 per cent of study participants now say they hold.\n\n\"Going by the messages we\u2019ve received, it\u2019s beneficial for the deceased, too,\" says Sophie.\n\n\"Some people report being told that their departed loved one can't go much further while those left behind are so sad.\n\n\"They invite them to let that grief go, so they can get on with the next chapter.\"\n\nTo find out more and to contribute your ADC experiences to the study, visit adcrp.org or @after_death_communication, or buy a book based on the research on Amazon."

            "article_content": "What do cattle mutilations, a grave robber and a good Samaritan have in common? They are all featured on Dean Petersen\u2019s Wyoming-based podcast, \u201cThat Doesn\u2019t Happen Everyday.\u201d\n\nPetersen of Cheyenne has been fascinated since an early age by the out-of-the-ordinary and downright bizarre stories that happen to everyday people. He has channeled that curiosity about the odd into his Wyoming-based podcast where he interviews a wide array of people in his efforts to dig up the strange.\n\n\u201cI would hear my parents talking about things that had happened when they were kids,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cUsually, it was kind of the mundane stuff about growing up on ranches in the Bridger Valley between Evanston and Green River. But once in a while, something weird would happen that they would bring up like cattle mutilations or the camp up in the mountains where lumberjacks supposedly had killed themselves.\u201d\n\nWhen Petersen moved back to Wyoming in 1999 to attend the University of Wyoming in Laramie, he began hearing these same stories from others. That was when he said he really started paying attention.\n\n\u201cA real driving influence for the podcast was hearing from other people all these legends I had heard as a kid,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cI was able to interview people and ask, did that really happen? In many cases, there's more truth than fiction with these stories.\u201d\n\nSeeking Out The Weird\n\nPetersen aired his first episode in April 2022, and it was, appropriately, a story from his parents, his original muses.\n\n\u201cMy parents had mentioned renting a house from Bob Ross, the painter on PBS,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cWhen you're a kid, you're like, \u2018Oh, of course, everyone does that.\u2019 As I got older, I saw that he's on magnets and on calendars. I did an episode about it.\n\n\u201cAt the time, Bob Ross wasn't known for painting. He was just an everyday guy who liked to paint. He had a bunch of paintings in his basement and asked my parents if they would put them in donut boxes and ship them to his new location in Virginia. So, it was a fun story.\u201d\n\nPetersen\u2019s tagline on his podcast is \u201cwhere we interview everyday people about things that don't normally happen every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is, some of some of these people aren't exactly everyday people,\u201d Petersen admitted. \u201cFor instance, we've had an Oscar winner from Wyoming, but what's interesting about the show is how many people will share these down-to-earth or straightforward stories of interesting things happening.\u201d\n\nWhether he is exploring his family stories or chasing down obscure leads, Petersen is always on the lookout for interesting stories that he can share.\n\n\u201cIt's become kind of a license where if I'm curious about something or interested in something, I go full force in trying to find out as much as I can about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI usually do that by either trying to interview someone who has experience with something or perhaps they've written a novel about it. I try to maybe dig a little bit deeper than a lot of the podcasts that are out there.\u201d\n\nHis stories are very eclectic and go beyond the borders of Wyoming. They contain the one common theme, they are outside the ordinary and many have fun twists that surprise both the viewer and Petersen himself.\n\n\u201cHopefully it's something weird and not always paranormal,\u201d he said. \u201cI take the most interesting thing you can find and try to get as close to the truth as you can, and then cut it and edit it into a listenable format. My show doesn't generally have a lot of banter. It tends to be more like someone telling you a story.\u201d\n\nThe Wyoming Twist\n\nWhen possible, Petersen visits the actual locations in Wyoming that are featured in his stories.\n\n\u201cIt's fun because if you go to visit the site of some of these legends, it's not all roped off and behind glass here in Wyoming,\u201d he said.\n\nThe areas that Petersen explores are not always marked on a map, and he has to rely on locals to point him in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThere were these lumberjacks killing themselves south of where my parents live,\u201d he said. \u201cUp in the Uinta mountains, there's a place called Suicide Park, and with a name like that, I asked them, \u2018Hey, you know what happened?\u2019\u201d\n\nHis parents knew the story and Petersen learned that several lumberjacks had died at this particular spot, and at least one or two were suicides.\n\n\u201cThere wasn't really much of a map or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got in my dad's truck and drove and drove through the mountains. Finally, we found the site, and there's one marker there.\n\n\u201cBy and large, it's your adventure. It's not something that's been paved and explained away. It's kind of fresh history for you to check out personally.\u201d\n\nPetersen stresses the importance of getting out to experience the history for yourself in remote Wyoming areas rather than just reading or listening to the story itself.\n\n\u201cIt has a special value when you are willing to get out of the office and go see something personally,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if there's not a lot there, to me, there's just that feeling of wanting to stand where someone else stood, of hearing the same sounds they might have heard, especially in Wyoming, where so much of it is undeveloped.\n\n\u201cIf you go to a site where something happened 150 years ago out in the middle of nowhere, it probably hasn't changed much as opposed to if you lived in a more developed or built up area.\u201d\n\nIf it\u2019s wacky, wild or weird in Wyoming, Dean Peterson of Cheyenne is talking about it. Even the paranormal is fair game for his \u201cThat Doesn\u2019t Happen Everyday\u201d podcast. (Courtesy Dean Petersen)\n\nIf it\u2019s wacky, wild or weird in Wyoming, Dean Peterson of Cheyenne is talking about it.

Even the paranormal is fair game for his \u201cThat Doesn\u2019t Happen Everyday\u201d podcast. (Courtesy Dean Petersen) Arrow left Arrow right\n\nFinding The Stories\n\nPetersen\u2019s stories range from the modern to the historic. He relies on oral histories from the Wyoming State Archives and the American Heritage Center in Laramie for much of his unique, first-hand accounts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that someone had the foresight to sit down with someone and get a story from them, from people who recovered bodies from airplane crashes to a parapsychologist who worked at the University of Wyoming,\u201d he said. \u201cI have started to research interviews from UFO witnesses, and the guy who recorded them had a PhD but he was willing to go out on a limb as a psychologist and start to interview these people and found out many of their stories were credible.\u201d\n\nPetersen is constantly surprised \u2014 and delighted \u2014 by the stories he has managed to find and the people willing to talk to him.\n\n\u201cThe most recent show was about a guy who had been a recon Marine, but now is an artist,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think it's funny because in the world of stereotypes and generalities, we don't usually think of Marines as artists or artists as Marines. It's not always about history, but it's almost always from Wyoming.\u201d\n\nAnother advantage to exploring Wyoming stories is that Petersen has found people in the Cowboy State to be approachable and willing to talk about the strange.\n\n\u201cOne time I emailed a Cheyenne gallery owner, Harvey Deselms, on Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cJust out of the blue, I sent him a message on Facebook saying, \u2018Hey, I heard the legend about dead bodies in the basement there. Could I interview you for my podcast?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe answer was yes.\n\n\u201cHe was very matter of fact about what happened with the body,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cI want to make it clear that what happened there occurred before Harvey ever moved his art gallery into the building. In fact, I learned there were two different murders in his building, and one of the victims had been buried in the basement.\u201d\n\nAs Petersen continues to dig around for stories, he has noticed that those in Wyoming tend to be pretty close to their history.\n\n\u201cHistory and culture are important to people in Wyoming, and it's not in an abstract way. I hear from people that my grandfather built that ranch or my grandmother taught at that one room schoolhouse, these kind of stories. It's very immediate and very close.\u201d\n\nA Family Adventure\n\nPetersen is also creating his own Wyoming memories with his kids in tow.\n\n\u201cI've made them come on some of the adventures, and sometimes they're really not that into it, honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat's fun, though, is that they do pay attention even when I don\u2019t think they are. They know where one of their favorite podcasts took place and like to talk about it.\u201d\n\nPetersen took his kids to a ranch by Fort Fred Steele State Historic Site where a friend had told him about two really strange incidents.\n\n\u201cThey had a bison that was mutilated,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a footprint or a tire track or anything around and they've also had some paranormal things that are just spooky happen there. Whenever I take the kids by there, they get excited and point it out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this excitement for Wyoming\u2019s odd stories that keeps Petersen searching for material for the next episode of \u201cThat Doesn\u2019t Happen Everyday.\u201d\n\nJackie Dorothy can be reached at jackie@cowboystatedaily.com."

            "article_content": "The 2000s ushered in a movie era shaped by CGI, 9-11, superheroes, remakes, reboots, and 3D. Unfortunately, many of these films missed the mark and have aged even worse.\n\nFor every The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter spectacle that arrived post-Y2K, there was a too-late sequel (Basic Instinct 2), a lame spoof (Disaster Movie), or an all-around atrocity (Gigli, Glitter, The Happening, Alone in the Dark).\n\nThere were many terrible movies released in the aughts, but these are some of the most egregious offenders. How many did you survive seeing in the theater or later on home video?\n\nSon of the Mask (2005)\n\nImage Credit: New Line Cinema.\n\nSon of the Mask is the second \u2014 and, mercifully, final \u2014 installment of The Mask franchise. The comedy stars Jamie Kennedy as Tim Avery, whose son is born with the power of the Mask.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1994\u2019s hit movie The Mask, Jim Carrey stars as the zoot suit-wearing trickster imbued with the power to alter his appearance and surroundings at will. Eleven years later, the sequel no one asked for bombed at the box office. Critics commented that Son of the Mask \u201csorely missed the presence of Jim Carrey\u201d and dismissed the sequel as \u201cloud,\u201d \u201cdumb,\u201d and \u201cpainfully unfunny.\u201d\n\nSon of the Mask was nominated for eight Razzies, winning for Worst Prequel or Sequel. Don\u2019t hold your breath for Grandson of the Mask to go into production anytime soon.\n\nThe Happening (2008)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Fox.\n\nM. Night Shyamalan directed this sci-fi \u201cthriller\u201d about a mysterious natural event prompting people to take their own lives. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as high school science teacher Elliot Moore.\n\nSixteen years after The Happening\u2018s release, it\u2019s not a spoiler to warn potential viewers that the villain in this movie is vegetation. Yes, trees strike back for being turned into paper bags \u2014 or something \u2014 and emit a chemical that drives people to end their miserable, eco-unfriendly lives. Time lamented that The Sixth Sense director Shyamalan \u201clost the touch\u201d while other critics shrugged the movie off as \u201cunconvincing trifle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough some have reevaluated The Happening as a B movie, Wahlberg himself admitted in 2010 to Entertainment Weekly that it was nothing more than \u201ca really bad movie.\u201d Unsurprisingly, The Happening represents the beginning and end of Wahlberg\u2019s on-screen relationship with Shyamalan.\n\nBasic Instinct 2 (2006)\n\nImage Credit: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc.\n\nBasic Instinct 2 arrived in 2006 \u2014 14 years after Basic Instinct made Sharon Stone an international star. In the sequel, Stone reprises her role as crime-mystery author Catherine Tramell, a woman police suspect is a serial killer who finds herself again in trouble with the law.\n\nWhen MGM threatened to pull the plug on Basic Instinct 2, Stone said she was promised at least $14 million for the sequel and sued. MGM eventually made the film, Stone got her payday, and audiences got an uninspired and unsexy sequel that didn\u2019t come close to having the cultural impact of the original. Critics referred to Basic Instinct 2 as \u201cgod-awful,\u201d with director Michael Caton-Jones later describing the filming of Basic Instinct 2 as a \u201cpainful experience.\u201d\n\nBasic Instinct 2 cleaned up at the Razzies, winning Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Prequel or Sequel. The movie\u2019s abysmal box office killed any instinct to make Basic Instinct 3.\n\nGlitter (2001)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Fox.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the romantic musical drama/shameless vanity project Glitter, pop star Mariah Carey plays an aspiring singer working as a club dancer.\n\nNo matter what you think of Carey\u2019s music or her reputation as a diva, even Carey herself calls Glitter the biggest regret of her career. The clich\u00e9d mess of a movie bombed at the box office and Carey soon returned to her day job of making schmaltzy Christmas jingles that you cannot escape. Some movies are so bad that they\u2019re funny (Showgirls, Mommie Dearest), but watching Glitter is strictly for masochists.\n\nGlitter got nominated for six Razzies, with Carey winning for Worst Actress. The lesson here for aspiring singers turned actors: stay in your lane.\n\nDumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd (2003)\n\nImage Credit: New Line Cinema.\n\nThis prequel to 1994\u2019s Dumb and Dumber stars Derek Richardson and Eric Christian Olsen as Harry and Lloyd, respectively, and is about the dim-witted characters meeting in high school. The original movie stars Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey as the goofy pals.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDumb and Dumberer is yet another example of prequel or sequel to a hit movie starring Jim Carrey that opted to not rehire Carrey. As a result, Richardson and Olsen kept getting compared to Daniels and Carrey, and the general consensus became that replacing the original stars was, well, dumb.\n\nCritics overwhelmingly disliked the lame humor of the Razzie-nominated prequel, and Dumb and Dumberer didn\u2019t come close to matching the original\u2019s box office take.\n\nGigli (2003)\n\nImage Credit: Sony Pictures Releasing.\n\nThe romantic crime comedy Gigli stars Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, who were romantically involved at the time, split soon after, and are now married. Martin Brest, who directed Beverly Hills Cop and Scent of a Woman, never directed a feature film again after Gigli, which should tell you all you need to know.\n\nGigli is one of the most notorious box office bombs of all time, costing at least $54 million and making only $7.3 million worldwide. Critics called the film a \u201cdisaster\u201d and commented on the lack of chemistry between real-life couple Affleck and Lopez, who broke up a year after Gigli\u2018s release only to reconnect and remarry in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhether or not Affleck and Lopez make their marriage work, they won\u2019t be working on Gigli Part Deux. The first Gigli grabbed all the top Razzies, including Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Director, and Worst Screen Couple.\n\nDisaster Movie (2008)\n\nImage Credit: Lions Gate Home Entertainment.\n\nDisaster Movie parodies turn-of-the-century disaster films, which became very popular right before Y2K. Kim Kardashian made her feature-film debut in the aptly named Disaster Movie.\n\nFor a while in the late \u201990s and aughts, every filmmaker thought they could replicate the success of the Scary Movie franchise, which spoofed horror movies, by spoofing other genres. Whereas Anna Faris and Regina Hall deliver laughs in the first four Scary Movie flicks, Disaster Movie is little more than a bunch of loosely connected lame gags and flatulence jokes that poke fun at movies such as Twister, The Day After Tomorrow, and Cloverfield.\n\nDisaster Movie rocks a disastrous 1% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and Empire ranks it at number 14 on its list of the 50 Worst Movies Ever Made.\n\nCatwoman (2004)\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCatwoman stars Halle Berry as Patience Phillips, a graphic designer who channels her inner Catwoman after uncovering a conspiracy within the cosmetics company she works for that could have worldwide health implications. Sharon Stone vamps it up as the wife of Hedare Beauty\u2019s owner.\n\nInstead of making a sequel to Batman Returns with Michelle Pfeiffer reprising her iconic role as Catwoman, Warner Bros. must have ingested too much catnip and green-lit this embarrassing stand-alone movie instead. Critics treated Catwoman like week-old kitty litter and the movie failed to make back its budget at the box office.\n\nCatwoman made the Razzies purr and won several awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. Razzie \u201cwinners\u201d rarely appear in person to accept their award, but Berry showed up with her Best Actress Oscar in hand and gave a short speech, describing Catwoman as a \u201cgod-awful movie.\u201d Meow!\n\nBattlefield Earth (2000)\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nBased upon the 1982 novel by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, the sci-fi epic Battlefield Earth stars Scientologist John Travolta as Terl, the security chief for the cruel alien occupiers known as Psychlos.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDespite being made with serious intentions by people who believe in Scientology, Battlefield Earth comes across as campy, silly, and filled with subpar special effects that just don\u2019t cut it for audiences who grew up watching Star Wars and Star Trek movies. Bad word of mouth put a swift end to Battlefield Earth\u2018s losing box office battle. The sci-fi stinker also stalled Travolta\u2019s career comeback that began with 1994\u2019s Pulp Fiction.\n\nBattlefield Earth won a whopping eight of its nine nominations for Golden Raspberries, including Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Actor (for Travolta), Worst Screenplay, and Worst Screen Couple for Travolta and \u201canyone sharing the screen with him.\u201d\n\nAlone in the Dark (2005)\n\nImage Credit: Lions Gate Films.\n\nUwe Boll directed this action-horror film based on the video game series of the same name. Alone in the Dark stars Christian Slater, Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff as paranormal investigators.\n\nNo discussion of the worst movies of the 2000s is complete without giving German director Boll the recognition he richly deserves. Although his 2000 movies such as House of the Dead and BloodRayne could have easily made this list, Alone in the Dark stands apart and is considered one of the worst movies ever made. Entertainment Weekly described the movie as \u201cso bad it\u2019s postmodern.\u201d Although Alone in the Dark fails on every level as a thriller, it works as an unintentional comedy for some.\n\nDespite failing at the box office and getting nominated for two Razzies, a sequel followed in 2008 that had a different story and cast. Boll served as producer on Alone in the Dark II, which got slightly less hostile reviews than the notorious original."

They should've been in the aisle behind me. It freaked me out pretty bad.\"\n\n\u2014u/PessimisticPeggy\n\nPhynart Studio / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n2.\"17 years ago, I gave birth my first baby and was laying in the hospital room with her in the crib-thing next to me that night. A nurse came in and said she could take the baby to the nursery for a few hours so I could get some sleep. I said no thanks, because I wanted my baby next to me so I could look at her. The next night I was pretty tired and asked another nurse if she could take the baby to the nursery for a couple hours. That nurse said they didn't have a nursery at the hospital \u2014 all babies stay with their moms.\"\n\n\u2014u/Trailerparkqueen\n\nJacek_sopotnicki / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n3.\"I was staying at a hotel and decided to sleep with the balcony door open because it was hot. I had a bad dream about a guy in a red checked shirt peering into the room, coming inside, and eating an ice cream at the end of my bed. When I woke up, I discovered a half-melted banana flavored ice cream between the bed and the wall.\"\n\n\u2014u/Yosemite_Sam9099\n\nJoebelanger / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n4.\"When I was a kid, maybe about 7, my parents went on a quick store run and left me at home alone. This was pretty normal in my small country town back then. As I sat behind our living room couch, our black cat walked past me, and all its hair stood straight up as it peered into the living room. It started hissing aggressively, as if it was either super angry or scared. So naturally, I leaned over to look around the couch, and saw a large footprints pressing into the carpet, walking through the living room, down the hall, and into my parents room.\"\n\nMiroslav Pesek / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n\"I froze and stayed that way until my parents got home. Of course, I told them instantly. They assured me everything was okay, blah blah blah. Maybe 10 years later, I learned that two weeks prior to me seeing this, my stepdad had witnessed it as well when he was home alone. Still gives me goosebumps thinking back to it. That was the first experience of what ended up being several years of being haunted by something. Rough years, man.\"\n\n\u2014u/BlackSheepBenny93\n\n5.\"When I was 14, I stayed at my sister's house one night and had a horrible nightmare about being strangled by the devil. I could only see his face smiling at me, and felt a crushing sensation on my throat. I told him to fuck off, swung a punch, and I then woke up. I looked over, and it was about 1 a.m.. The next morning, my sister was complaining that she had a really horrible nightmare that the devil was strangling her. Spooked, I asked her what time this happened. She said, 'around one o'clock.'\"\n\n\u2014u/tiredandstupid82\n\nVickivick / Getty Images\n\n6.\"It was the early 90s, and I was about 9 years old. One day, I answered the landline phone in our house and was met with a man I didn't recognize who knew me by name. He said he knew my mom and tried to chat with me. I didn't know him (and didn't like talking to adults), so I said, 'Let me get my mom,' and ran to get her. She answered the phone, but the man had hung up. A few weeks later, a girl in the grade ahead of me went missing. She'd apparently told her friends that a man contacted her on the phone, said he was a friend of her mom's, and told her he was going to pick her up after school to pick a present out for her mom as surprise. She was kidnapped and murdered, but they never caught the man.\"\n\nFox\n\n\"As it turns, out quite a few young girls had gotten the same phone call I had. He seemed to have been choosing his victim. The FBI came to my house to ask me questions about that phone call. It still haunts me 30 years later. I'm still hoping they catch the guy. It was absolutely heartbreaking.\"\n\n\u2014u/laureltreesinbloom\n\n7.\"I was in a swamp in southern Arkansas. My uncle and I were hunting and had gotten out there pretty early. We were just sitting and waiting and then we both saw this coyote walking past. The coyote looked at us for a minute, stood up on its hind legs, then walked back into the woods just on those hind legs. I swear this happened. I've never seen anything like it before or since.\"\n\n\u2014u/dalroti47\n\nImnature / Getty Images\n\n8.\"I was the sole witness to a murder. I was in a jeep with the top down, waiting for two guys on the sidewalk to stop arguing. One guy pulled a shank out of his sock and stuffed it, stiff armed, into the other guy's eye. The crunch was sickening. He took off. I ran up, and blood was spurting out of the dude's face onto the sidewalk. Long story short, he was dead by the time the ambulance showed up. I was going to testify in court but the other dude plead guilty and got 20-ish years, I believe. It was a long time ago. Not long enough for me to forget that sound, though.\"\n\n\u2014u/frick-you-fricker\n\nApple TV\n\n9.\"I was a kid on Christmas Day and there was a knock on our front door. Expecting it to be family, my dad and I opened it together. There was an old man standing there, asking for directions to the train station. Our house was smack bang in the middle of suburbia, so he must have been walking in the wrong direction for hours. My dad gave him the directions and offered to drive him, but he declined, and thanked us. As he was leaving he looked down at me and said something really strange: 'Never go to that place that scares you.'\"\n\nDaisy Daisy / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n\"This man was really, really old and walked at a shuffling pace. Shrugging off his comment as well-intentioned senility, I went back to the living room. As he was walking down our path, it started to rain. My dad went to get an umbrella from under the stairs to give to him, but when he went back outside, the man was gone. My dad ran down the path and up and down the street trying to find him, but he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nThe place I was scared of was this shack in the woods I used to walk past on my way to and from school. It always gave me a bad feeling. A few years later, someone was arrested for murdering a child there.\"\n\n\u2014u/Disastrous_Reserve87\n\n10.\"This happened when I was about 12. I was just casually walking my dog one afternoon when, suddenly, I saw some weird guy following me. At first I thought he was drunk, judging by his weird movements. But then he started hiding behind cars and trees, peeking out as though he wanted me to see him. Anyway, I ran as fast as I could and didn't walk there for a week. Mind you, this was happening while there was an actual serial killer on the loose in our town, so I honestly might've escaped a murderer.\"\n\n\u2014u/total_spinning_shark\n\nDavid Wall / Getty Images\n\n11.\"When I was in high school, one day I was home alone and mowing the backyard, leaving the garage door in the front open. When I finished mowing, I went back to the garage (which is located underneath the bedrooms of the house) to close it, and I could hear loud footsteps in my parents room overhead. I freaked out and ran inside. Assuming one of my family members was home, I yelled up the stairs for them to stop it, but I got no response.\"\n\nRzelich / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n\"At this point, I grabbed my dad's pistol out of the safe in the living room and yelled upstairs that I had a weapon and to stop. I called my parents as I was freaking out, and my dad told me to NOT go upstairs. I sat there out of view of the stairwell until he got home.\n\nHe took the pistol away, and locked it up, and we went upstairs to check. My parents' bedroom had a screen door to a balcony, which overlooked the backyard. The door and screen door were open. However, nothing was stolen.\"\n\n\u2014u/yettitrooper88\n\n12.\"I'm a dog walker. We had a client who was an extremely rich and well known coin collector that lived alone with his dog. He was a really nice guy, but he had a bit of an alcohol problem. He smelled like booze and was very disheveled every morning when we\u2019d pick his dog up to walk her. One monday morning, I walked into his huge house and saw him asleep on the couch as he normally was, so I called his name to wake him up. I realized he was half on his couch and in a really weird position. He wasn't responding up so eventually I walked over to wake him up, and quickly realized he wasn't asleep at all: he was dead.\"\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\n\"I threw up on his patio and called 911. They said he\u2019d been dead since Friday. He lived there alone and didn\u2019t have friends or family nearby, so I was the one that found him. Really really sad, as he was very nice and not very old. But yeah still have nightmares about what I found.\"\n\n\u2014u/PrimaryRabbit\n\n13.\"A girl I went to college with went on a weeklong solo hike on the Appalachian Trail. This was before phone cameras were any good so she had a few of those disposable Kodak cameras with her. When she got the film developed, there were pictures of her sleeping. Multiple pictures from different days. Someone was stalking her and wanted her to know it.\"\n\n\u2014u/Accidental-Genius\n\nNickylloyd / Getty Images\n\n14.\"When I was a kid, I remember one day I was laying on my bedroom floor with the door wide open while my parents were watching TV in the living room. I remember it was about 1 a.m.. I tried to get up to use the bathroom, but my brain would almost act out me doing it without me physically moving. It wasn\u2019t until about the 5th time that I realized I had never actually gotten up at all. I was stuck on the floor \u2014 I couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t talk, couldn\u2019t cry for my parents. It felt like something had sucked the soul out of my body and I was pinned to the ground. It wasn\u2019t until my dad walked in to put me in my bed that I started balling my eyes out.\"\n\n\u2014u/Stockwaa\n\nBrigitte Smith / Getty Images\n\n15.\"When I was about 13 years old, I saw my doppelg\u00e4nger in my childhood home. I got up from the couch one evening and saw a duplicate version of myself staring straight back at me for a solid three or four seconds. Whatever it was, it appeared exactly like I did that night \u2014 the same clothes, haircut, etc.. It was just standing there at the end of the hallway, looking right back at me intently with a neutral expression on its face. Then, it disappeared.\"\n\nToshiro Shimada / Getty Images\n\n\"I immediately ran to my mom\u2019s room \u2014 which was adjacent to where my doppelg\u00e4nger had stood mere seconds prior \u2014 and told her what I saw. My mother had been playing music on her CD player to fall asleep to and told me that, immediately before I came in, the player started going berserk. Suddenly, it sounded like an old record player with someone\u2019s finger moving the record around against the needle.\n\nIt never happened again. Just that one time.\"\n\n\u2014u/IfYouSaySo4206969\n\n16.\"I lived in a rental house 10 years ago. From the backdoor, you could access a narrow enclosure adjacent to the neighbor's house (their bedroom was right next to it). I didn't use the small backyard, so I never put a bulb in the socket outside. One day, my neighbor told me they heard movement in my backyard at night, like someone jumping down from the wall on to the concrete ground. They said it happened on multiple occasions and they thought it was probably a thief. So, I bought a bulb and went to put it outside. The socket was very high and I had to stand on a tall wooden stool to reach it. That night before I went to bed, I switched it on and checked the backyard.\"\n\nCrazyd / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n\"The next morning, I didn't go to the backyard and just switched off the light before going to work. On the second night, I went to switch it on, but the backyard remained dark no matter how many times I tried. I thought the bulb was defective, but I was scared of the dark and the thief, so I decided to check it out in the morning.\n\nWhen I went out the next day, the bulb was not in the socket. Instead, it was lying on the ground, completely undamaged. There was no way it could have survived a fall from that high and I don't know why the thief wouldn't have just taken it with them. Anyway, I took the bulb inside and it was working fine, so I put it back in and went to work.\n\nOn the third night, I switched the light on again and went to bed. Around 3 a.m., I walked to the backdoor and slightly opened it to see if the bulb was still working. It was pitch dark. I closed the door quickly and went back to my room.\n\nThe next morning, the bulb was back on the ground, undamaged. I avoided going to the backyard as much as possible from that day on and didn't attempt to put any bulb there again.\"\n\n\u2014u/SuvenPan\n\n17.\"One day, my sister and I went to the park near our house to play some tennis. I took my phone out of my pocket and put in in my bag, thinking I didn\u2019t want it to overheat in the sun. My sister saw and did the same. After we finished our game, my sister checked our bag and asked me where my phone went. I checked the bag and, sure enough, my phone was not there. We looked all around the tennis court and even in the garbage, but it was nowhere to be found.\"\n\nDmp / Getty Images\n\n\"My sister and I were so confused to the point that I thought a man walking with his baby \u2014 the only other person we saw at the park \u2014 might have taken it at some point when we weren\u2019t looking.\n\nOn a weird hunch, I had my sister call my brother, because I had originally planned to leave my phone at home to charge. Sure enough, my brother checked my room and found my phone \u2014 that both my sister and I watched being put into the bag at the park \u2014 on my bed, charging.\"\n\n\u2014u/EcstaticGod\n\n18.\"My house is on the side of a highway and I have windows facing the highway. It was late at night, I couldn't sleep so I decided to tire myself out by jump roping. Halfway through my session, I took a glance outside and I saw a man standing on the closest side of the highway staring, at me under the lamp post. It felt as if it was something out of a horror movie. Once I saw his creepy silhouette, I immediately just ducked to the ground. When I looked up, he was gone. To me now it's a funny situation, as he probably was just some homeless man confused as to why someone was jump roping at like midnight. But at the time, it was really, really creepy.\"\n\n\u2014u/ShloppShlopp\n\nEpicurean / Getty Images\n\n19.\"I was driving on the interstate late at night. The road was decently foggy, so visibility was somewhat reduced. In this distance there was a light waving back and forth through the fog in the middle of the road, slowly getting more pronounced as I got closer. I got close enough to then see that it was a guy waving his phone flashlight to alert oncoming traffic. Right in the area past him was two cars that had just crashed, and bodies all over the road. No first responders there yet or anything. Just carnage and a man flashing a light.\"\n\n\u2014u/GoMyKnicks\n\nNorthlightimages / Getty Images\n\n20.\"I got quite a few reports about this while working at a summer camp. It was up in the mountains, and I worked there for a couple summers as a teen. Kids attending the camp would sometimes make up stories about seeing Bigfoot or a ghost out in the forest, typical dumb kids stuff. But there was one type of story in particular that I kept hearing, from different groups over several months each summer, which had me a bit worried. The first time I heard of it was from one of the older camp employees recounting a story from many years prior. Apparently, his girlfriend at the time was unable to sleep in her cabin because she thought she was being watched by something outside her window. She said it was a very large, black crow that would just sit by the window and stare at her, but in a strange, menacing way. Even when the blinds were closed, she'd open them back up hours later and it would still be there staring.\"\n\nIstvan Hernadi Photography... Mo / Getty Images\n\n\"She would sometimes see it in the forest \u2014 even during the day \u2014 sitting between the trees not making a sound, just glaring at her. Its gaze followed her as she walked. She said it was the same crow, she was certain. Its eyes 'felt human,' according to her.\n\nWell, those stories came up every couple weeks like clockwork. Some kid would one day become distant and quiet, not wanting to leave their cabin for activities. Sometimes they'd ask to go home early. Most wouldn't say why, I think because they knew no one would believe them. But occasionally after prodding, they would admit that they were afraid of something they were seeing in the forest and around their cabin. All of these kids described pretty much the same thing. And it wasn't just kids \u2014 some of the other staff members claimed to have seen something similar as well. It was pretty easy to tell who was bullshitting and who wasn't. The ones who I think really did see something did not want to talk about it. They were very bothered by what they had been experiencing. They'd have awful nightmares, and they wouldn't want to be outside for long.\n\nI've seen plenty of crows up there, but they were just crows. They'd flap around, squawk and shit ,and that was it. I don't know why a crow would follow someone or stare at them for hours, that doesn't sound natural at all to me. I don't know what to make of it. It such a silly story to hear the first time, but after hearing it again and again from people who have no way of knowing about it, you start to wonder. Especially after seeing how upset these people are. They didn't seem to be faking it for attention. It ruined their entire week.\"\n\n\u2014u/14thCluelessbird\n\n21.\"I took my nephew to this park semi-surrounded by woods. While pushing him on the swings I heard rustling and turned around to see a man in a ski mask watching us. 10/10 will never go back.\"\n\n\u2014u/Icy_Adhesiveness_400\n\nRapideye / Getty Images\n\n22.\"When I was younger (11, maybe 12) I moved into a new house. My room had a big closet with access to the attic. I was a scared little kid and was worried a monster lived up there. Once, I woke up in the middle of the night to see my closet door slowlyyyyy opening. I didn\u2019t move and screamed for my parents.\"\n\nBreakermaximus / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n\"Fortunately, we found out if the door wasn't properly closed, it would open itself. I still have never been as scared as I was as in the moment.\"\n\n\u2014u/trich87\n\n23.\"When I was about 6 or 7, I woke up in the middle of the night to a faint sound of what seemed like someone stacking plates in the kitchen, every couple of minutes. With the location of my bedroom door giving me a direct view of the kitchen entrance and part of the kitchen, I opened it and peeked my head to see what was going on. To this day, I swear I remember just seeing some old woman \u2014 with sunken eyes, her gaping mouth completely wide open, head turned almost 90 degrees \u2014 just staring at me, not even moving. What's even more frightening, was that the sound suddenly stopped as I did this. While I'm sure it could've just been my eyes struggling to adjust, and merely shapes, the longer my eyes adjusted, the more vivid she became. I just remember staring right back and not moving from what felt like several minutes.\"\n\nEdwin Tan / Getty Images\n\n\"I decided to make a break for my parents bedroom, which was across from my bedroom. I told them what happened and they checked and confirmed nothing was there. Fortunately, we were scheduled for an early flight to visit family, so everyone decided to get up. I'm sure it could've just been the young mind playing tricks, nevertheless, I'll never forget that face.\"\n\n\u2014u/ijandro\n\n24.\"A large black van with tinted windows followed me and the group of other kids I was with, including my little sister. It was winter, I think a no bus day, and we lived in Canada, so needless to say it was snowy. Me and some other kids (including my sister) were at our babysitter's place, but still wanted to go on a walk. So, we put on all our snow stuff and were on our way. At one point, my sister pointed out a black van slowly driving behind us (I think we were a group of five or six, and most of us were around 10 years old, save for my sister, who would've been around 7). We just assumed they were driving slow because of the road, or maybe they were looking for a house. Still, we ran the best we could (anyone who has tried to run in full winter gear knows how hard it is) until we couldn't see the van anymore.\"\n\nShayes17 / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n\"When it was out of sight, we started walking again. A minute later, my sister pointed out the van again and it's pretty much the exact distance behind us that it was before we ran. At this point we were a little weirded out, but thought we were just walking slow so it caught up. So we ran again, further this time, and kept looking back. I think I remember looking back and seeing nothing, then looking back a few seconds later to see the van was there again.\n\nAt this point, we were all freaked out and I remember having a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach seeing it again. We all began running like our lives depended on it because, in our minds, they did. My sister was the slowest and one of the larger and older boys had to pull her along so she didn't get left behind. I remember looking back and seeing the van speeding up a bit, still at a distance, but clearly trying to keep up with us.\n\nIt felt like we were running for ages, but we finally reached the babysitter's house, ran up the stairs, slammed the door shut, and caught our breath. We told her what happened, but I don't think she believed us\n\nI remember me and another girl who was in the group saw the same van drive by the window at least once (I remember it being twice, though).\n\nIDK, it might've been nothing that our brains twisted to be something, but, about a decade later, I still can't shake the feeling that the van was bad news and that we were all lucky we noticed it in time.\"\n\n\u2014u/Pink_Artistic_Witch\n\nHave you had a creepy, bone-chilling experience like these?

            "article_content": "India's Deep Sea Mission is on the right track, and the discovery of an active hydrothermal vent 4,500 metres below the surface of the Indian Ocean this month will boost scientists' confidence and provide valuable experience for further exploration, the country's top scientists have said.\n\nIn an interview with PTI, Thamban Meloth, Director of the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), said this is just the beginning.\n\nIn a groundbreaking achievement, a team of Indian scientists from the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) and the NCPOR captured the first image of an active hydrothermal vent located 4,500 metres below the surface of the Indian Ocean around a week ago.\n\nThis is a major milestone in India's ambitious Rs 4,000-crore Deep Ocean Mission, aimed at exploring uncharted depths of the ocean to find new minerals and life forms and improve understanding of the ocean's role in climate change.\n\n''Seeing is believing,'' Meloth said.\n\n''While we had already identified proof of both active and inactive hydrothermal vents (in the Central and Southwest Indian Ridges in the Southern Indian Ocean), we wanted to get visual images. That's what we achieved this time,'' he said.\n\nAccording to Meloth, the discovery validates the investment in the blue economy and boosts scientists' confidence to continue exploring. It will play a crucial role in building expertise for future expeditions, he said.\n\n''While we are excited about this success, there is much more of the Indian Ocean to explore. Sustained support is needed for further studies. We are building a new ship for such surveys, which will be ready in three years as part of the Deep Ocean Mission,'' the NCPOR director said.\n\nHydrothermal vents are like hot springs on the ocean floor. They form along mid-ocean ridges where tectonic plates move apart. The magma from the Earth's mantle rises to fill the gap and cools to form new crust and volcanic mountain chains.\n\nWhen seawater seeps into the cracks in the crust, it gets heated by this magma and shoots back out, carrying dissolved minerals. As the hot water meets the cold seawater, these minerals solidify, creating chimney-like structures around the vents.\n\nThe first hydrothermal vent was discovered in 1977 on the Galapagos Rift in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Since then, scientists have discovered hundreds of hydrothermal vents across the world's oceans, particularly along mid-ocean ridges, back-arc basins, and other tectonically active regions.\n\nMeloth said hydrothermal vents are important for two reasons.\n\nFirst, they produce valuable minerals like nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are essential for modern technologies and clean energy solutions and second, they support unique life forms that thrive without sunlight, using a process called chemosynthesis to survive.\n\nChemosynthesis allows organisms to convert inorganic molecules into energy using chemicals. By harnessing energy from inorganic compounds, these organisms can thrive and support a rich ecosystem in such areas.\n\nAt hydrothermal vents, the energy from the breakdown of hydrogen sulfide, a common compound in vent plumes, drives chemosynthesis, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n''The Indian Ocean has the Central and Southern Indian Ocean Ridges where magma emerges from the mantle. The magma cools due to the seawater and interacts with it. As a result, many minerals and rare metals, including those essential for future technologies like nickel, manganese, and cobalt, are formed there,'' Meloth told PTI.\n\nThese ridges are like underwater mountain ranges, as rugged as the Himalayas. Exploring them is extremely challenging due to the depth -- about 3,000 to 5,000 metres -- and the complete darkness, Meloth explained.\n\n''It is like searching for a needle in hundreds of haystacks,'' he said.\n\nThe team relied on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), a self-programmed robotic instrument capable of smoothly navigating the rugged underwater terrain, capturing high-resolution images and collecting data.\n\nNIOT Director Balaji Ramakrishnan told PTI that India conducted four expeditions over the last two years in the region to locate the hydrothermal vent.\n\n''The objective of this expedition was to capture images of the hydrothermal vent and conduct additional engineering studies to gather parameters useful for our investigations,'' he said.\n\nRamakrishnan said the scientists are yet to analyse the complete set of videos, photographs, and samples they have collected, among other data.\n\nThe scientists said that hydrothermal vents are not just mineral treasure troves; they are also cradles of unique ecosystems.\n\nUnlike most life on Earth which depends on sunlight, deep-sea organisms rely on chemosynthesis, a process that uses chemicals like hydrogen sulfide to generate energy.\n\n''The animals living around hydrothermal vents make their living from the chemicals coming out of the seafloor,'' Meloth explained.\n\nThis discovery opens doors for Indian scientists to study life forms that exist in extreme conditions. These organisms could provide insights into the origins of life on Earth.\n\nRussian biochemist Aleksandr Oparin in 1922 proposed a chemosynthetic theory of the origin of life which says that ''life might have originated at first on earth through a series of combinations of chemical substances in the distant past and it all happened in water''.\n\nHowever, conducting research in the deep ocean comes with its share of challenges, Meloth said.\n\n''The weather in the Southern Ocean is a major challenge. Ocean currents and extremely windy conditions can make it difficult to launch operations. Even during a one-month survey, we might get only one or two weeks of suitable weather,'' he said.\n\nAdding to the difficulty is the sheer scale of the search. Hydrothermal vents are often small, about one or two meters wide, scattered across thousands of km of ocean, he said.\n\n''The instruments need to be incredibly precise to locate these vents. It requires a mix of experience and a bit of luck,'' Meloth added.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

            "article_content": "Sam Altman asked his followers on X for ideas to improve OpenAI in 2025.\n\nAltman responded to suggestions about creating family accounts and improving video features.\n\nOpenAI had a rocky year following new litigation from competitor Elon Musk.\n\nSam Altman wants your suggestions for improving OpenAI in the new year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Christmas Eve, OpenAI's CEO opened the floor to his followers on X with a simple question: \"what would you like openai to build/fix in 2025?\"\n\nAltman's post comes toward the end of a tumultuous year for OpenAI. Elon Musk, who cofounded the company but left the board in 2018, filed a lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI in February. Musk withdrew the lawsuit in June but filed a new lawsuit in August in which he argued that OpenAI executives \"deceived\" him into cofounding the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid its legal challenges, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in funding in October \u2014 a record-high funding round for tech in Silicon Valley \u2014 pushing the company's valuation to $157 billion.\n\nNow, Altman is looking at what's in store for the new year, and he's crowdsourcing ideas on how to continue advancing and improving not just ChatGPT but all of the company's existing and emerging products.\n\nHere are three ideas Altman appears to be eyeing so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamily accounts\n\nOne X follower responded to Altman's post with a suggestion to allow OpenAI users to create accounts for families that include guardrails, allowing kids to use the platform safely.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Let their curiosity take off, but within reasonable limits, as determined by the parent,\" the user wrote, to which Altman responded: \"this is a good idea!\"\n\nOpenAI's website states that ChatGPT isn't meant for children under 13 and requires parental consent for children ages 13 to 18 to use the platform, but does not actively verify the consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImprovements to voice chats\n\nChatGPT developed a voice feature that allows users to speak directly to the chatbot. One of Altman's followers suggested that the feature be improved because, as of now, per the user, \"you can't just silently think for 5 seconds without being interrupted.\"\n\nAltman wrote that that's a \"good point.\" Users have struggled with the feature since it was rolled out, with some having reported bugs and misinterpretations from the chatbot.\n\nBetter video generation\n\nMultiple users urged Altman to improve Sora, OpenAI's text-to-video model. Sora allows users to describe a video they want the platform to create with a written prompt, which Sora will generate based on the text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSora officially launched on December 9 after being piloted to a limited group of creators in February. Rohan Sahai, Sora's product lead, said at the launch that the product would begin more conservatively because its team wants to prevent illegal activity like copyright violations while allowing for creative expression.\n\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider."

The tech giant has not shared specific sales data on the number of licenses sold.\n\nWhy It Matters: This move mirrors those of other Microsoft business units which have altered the ways they use OpenAI models. For instance, GitHub, acquired by Microsoft in 2018, added models from Anthropic and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google in October as alternatives to OpenAI's GPT-4.\n\nPreviously it was reported that company insiders were concerned about Microsoft\u2019s AI strategy being heavily reliant on its partnership with OpenAI.\n\nIn October, the two companies engaged in talks to decide how Microsoft's $14 billion investment in OpenAI would be converted into equity in the AI firm.\n\nOpenAI plans to remove a clause that restricts Microsoft\u2019s access to its most advanced AI models upon achieving artificial general intelligence, according to a report published in December.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nRead Next:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

And while it is largely recognized for its AI breakthroughs (ChatGPT \u2013 its AI chatbot \u2013 had kickstarted the AI race upon its launch), the firm has a prior history in robotics research, which it reportedly planned to revisit.\n\nAccording to a report by The Information \u2013 citing people familiar with the matter \u2013 the AI giant is once again weighing the possibility of entering the sector, this time with the development of a full-fledged humanoid robot. Earlier in October this year, reports surfaced that OpenAI was collaborating with Broadcom and TSMC to develop its first in-house chip to support its artificial intelligence systems.\n\nUntil 2021, the organization maintained a dedicated robotics division focused on creating AI models in order to power autonomous machines. At that time, its researchers trained robotic arms to solve complex tasks like its popular Rubik\u2019s cubes robot called Roboschool, which is a set of simulation tools aimed at advancing robot training.\n\nLater, the robotics division was disbanded as OpenAI shifted its resources toward refining its core AI systems. Now, the firm has reportedly regained a renewed interest, in robotics, especially at a time when advancements in hardware and AI tech has been made over the past years.\n\nSo far, OpenAI has driven investments in startups like Figure and 1X, both of which focus on humanoid robots. Figure\u2019s latest model, the Figure 02, has been tested in industrial settings such as BMW\u2019s manufacturing facilities, where it performed complex tasks like moving heavy components. Similarly, 1X has developed consumer-oriented robots, including a prototype capable of household assistance.\n\nFor sci-fi lovers, the concept of humanoid robots is nothing new. They are a common staple in sci-fi films, often depicted as either threats to or helpers of humanity. Humanoid robots are designed to emulate the physical structure and capabilities of humans and are envisioned as versatile agents capable of operating in environments built for human use. With their two arms, two legs, and upright posture, humanoid robots could navigate and interact with the world much like humans can. This adaptability makes humanoid robots an attractive option \u2013 robots with a focus on consumer interactions can assist with everyday chores in homes, while industrial sectors can use them as tools for handling physically demanding tasks, for example."

            "article_content": "Dr Hassabis, who oversees Google DeepMind, the company\u2019s primary AI lab, now says that method is running out of steam simply because tech companies are running out of data. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Dr Demis Hassabis, one of the most influential artificial intelligence experts in the world, has a warning for the rest of the tech industry: Don\u2019t expect chatbots to continue to improve as quickly as they have over the past few years.\n\nAI researchers have for some time been relying on a fairly simple concept to improve their systems: the more data culled from the internet that they pumped into large language models \u2013 the technology behind chatbots \u2013 the better those systems performed.\n\nBut Dr Hassabis, who oversees Google DeepMind, the company\u2019s primary AI lab, now says that method is running out of steam simply because tech companies are running out of data.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the industry is seeing diminishing returns,\u201d Dr Hassabis said this month in an interview with The New York Times as he prepared to accept a Nobel Prize for his work on AI.\n\nDr Hassabis is not the only AI expert warning of a slowdown. Interviews with 20 executives and researchers showed a widespread belief that the tech industry is running into a problem many would have thought was unthinkable just a few years ago: They have used up most of the digital text available on the internet.\n\nThat problem is starting to surface even as billions of dollars continue to be poured into AI development.\n\nLast week, Databricks, an AI data company, said it was closing in on US$10 billion ( S$13.5 billion ) in funding \u2013 the largest-ever private funding round for a startup. And the biggest companies in tech are signaling that they have no plans to slow down their spending on the giant data centers that run AI systems.\n\nNot everyone in the AI world is concerned. Some, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, say progress will continue at the same pace, albeit with some twists on old techniques. Mr Dario Amodei, CEO of AI startup Anthropic, and Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, are also bullish.\n\n(The Times has sued OpenAI, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to AI systems. OpenAI has denied the claims.)\n\nThe roots of the debate trace to 2020 when Associate Professor Jared Kaplan, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University, published a research paper showing that large language models steadily grew more powerful and lifelike as they analysed more data.\n\nResearchers called Kaplan\u2019s findings \u201cthe Scaling Laws\u201d. Just as students learn more by reading more books, AI systems improved as they ingested increasingly large amounts of digital text culled from the internet, including news articles, chat logs and computer programs.\n\nSeeing the raw power of this phenomenon, companies such as OpenAI, Google and Meta raced to get their hands on as much internet data as possible, cutting corners, ignoring corporate policies and even debating whether they should skirt the law, according to an examination this year by the Times.\n\nIt was the modern equivalent of Moore\u2019s Law, the oft-quoted maxim coined in the 1960s by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. He showed that the number of transistors on a silicon chip doubled every two years or so, steadily increasing the power of the world\u2019s computers. Moore\u2019s Law held up for 40 years. But eventually, it started to slow.\n\nThe problem is: Neither the Scaling Laws nor Moore\u2019s Law are immutable laws of nature. They\u2019re simply smart observations. One held up for decades. The others may have a much shorter shelf life.\n\nGoogle and Kaplan\u2019s new employer, Anthropic, cannot just throw more text at their AI systems because there is little text left to throw.\n\n\u201cThere were extraordinary returns over the last three or four years as the Scaling Laws were getting going,\u201d Dr Hassabis said. \u201cBut we are no longer getting the same progress.\u201d\n\nDr Hassabis said existing techniques would continue to improve AI in some ways. But he said he believed that entirely new ideas were needed to reach the goal that Google and many others were chasing: a machine that could match the power of the human brain.\n\nMr Ilya Sutskever, who was instrumental in pushing the industry to think big as a researcher at both Google and OpenAI before leaving OpenAI to create a new startup this past spring, made the same point during a speech this month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve achieved peak data, and there\u2019ll be no more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to deal with the data that we have. There\u2019s only one internet.\u201d\n\nDr Hassabis and others are exploring a different approach. They are developing ways for large language models to learn from their own trial and error.\n\nBy working through various math problems, for instance, language models can learn which methods lead to the right answer and which do not. In essence, the models train on data that they themselves generate. Researchers call this \u201csynthetic data\u201d.\n\nOpenAI recently released a new system called OpenAI o1 that was built this way. But the method only works in areas such as math and computing programming, where there is a firm distinction between right and wrong.\n\nEven in these areas, AI systems have a way of making mistakes and making things up. That can hamper efforts to build AI \u201cagents\u201d that can write their own computer programs and take actions on behalf of internet users, which experts see as one of AI\u2019s most important skills.\n\nSorting through the wider expanses of human knowledge is even more difficult.\n\n\u201cThese methods only work in areas where things are empirically true, like math and science,\u201d said Mr Dylan Patel, chief analyst for research firm SemiAnalysis, who closely follows the rise of AI technologies. \u201cThe humanities and the arts, moral and philosophical problems are much more difficult.\u201d\n\nPeople such as Mr Altman say these new techniques will continue to push the technology ahead. But if progress reaches a plateau, the implications could be far-reaching, even for Nvidia, which has become one of the most valuable companies in the world thanks to the AI boom.\n\nDuring a call with analysts last month, Mr Huang was asked how the company was helping customers work through a potential slowdown and what the repercussions might be for its business. He said that evidence showed there were still gains being made, but that businesses were also testing new processes and techniques on AI chips.\n\n\u201cAs a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great,\u201d Mr Huang said.\n\nAlthough he is confident about Nvidia\u2019s prospects, some of the company\u2019s biggest customers acknowledge that they must prepare for the possibility that AI will not advance as quickly as expected.\n\n\u201cWe have had to grapple with this. Is this thing real or not?\u201d said Ms Rachel Peterson, vice president of data centers at Meta. \u201cIt is a great question because of all the dollars that are being thrown into this across the board.\u201d NYTIMES\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you."

            "article_content": "Suicides are rarely the result of a single factor. They are deeply influenced by a web of social, cultural, systemic, and economic conditions. Yet, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reports on suicides often simplify these complex issues, attributing them to a single cause. When we look closely at NCRB data, several key trends emerge.\n\nOn average, over the past eight years (2015 to 2022), nearly 1,01,188 men have died by suicide each year, compared to 43,314 women. The rate of suicide for men is 14.2 per 100,000 male population, while for women, it is 6.6 per 100,000 female population.\n\nThe primary reason for suicide, regardless of gender, is \u201cfamily problems,\u201d which account for 23.06% of suicides in India. However, the NCRB does not clearly define what constitutes \u201cfamily problems\u201d, leaving the term open to interpretation. Illness ranks the second largest cause of suicides, contributing to 23.05% of deaths.\n\nMarriage-related issues are the third most common cause, responsible for 3.28% of suicides among men and 9.66% among women. There are five sub categories under \u201cmarriage related issues\u201d listed by the NCRB \u2014 non-settlement of marriage, dowry disputes, extra-marital affairs, divorce, and others. The total number of suicides due to marriage-related issues over the last eight years is 26,588 men, and 33,480 women. Under this category, dowry-related issues are the largest cause of suicide among women (14,250), and \u201cnon-settlement of marriage\u201d is the largest cause among men (10,119).\n\nThere is no specific definition for \"non-settlement of marriage\" -- but it likely refers to unmarried persons. Senior police officers told TNM that this phrase is used when a marriage does not happen or gets cancelled, mainly due to false promises, deceit, or monetary exploitation, as well as due to dowry demands, threats, or abuse.\n\nIt's also important to note that out of the 8,09,506 men who have died by suicide between 2015 and 2022, farmers and farm labourers constitute about 10% \u2014 81,402. While the top reasons for these suicides are socioeconomic factors and crop failures, there are no sub categories for farmers who died due to another reason.\n\nSo, why do more men die of suicide?\n\nA significant factor lies in the methods men choose when attempting suicide. A research paper titled \u2018Is Lethality Different between Males and Females? Clinical and Gender Differences in Inpatient Suicide Attempters\u2019 reveals that men often use more violent and lethal methods, which results in higher lethality rates. Women, although they attempt suicide more frequently, tend to choose methods with lower immediate fatality. This often leads to a higher likelihood of rescue and intervention, whereas the more extreme measures chosen by men \u2014 such as jumping in front of trains or using firearms \u2014 result in fewer chances for survival. This difference in the lethality of methods underscores the importance of targeted suicide prevention strategies, recognising the gender-specific patterns in suicide behaviors.\n\nThe NCRB numbers are in line with this study. For every 10 women who die by methods such as sleeping pills, drowning, or consuming poison, 21 men die using similar means. Men are 61 times more likely to die by jumping in front of a train or vehicle (10:61 ratio), and 35 times more likely to die from electrocution (10:35 ratio). These figures highlight the more violent nature of male suicide attempts, which not only results in a higher death rate but also makes intervention efforts more challenging.\n\nThe 498A fight\n\nSection 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), introduced in 1983, was a pivotal legal provision aimed at protecting women from cruelty within marriage. The section specifically addresses cases where a woman is subjected to harassment or abuse by her husband or his family, including demands for dowry, emotional distress, and physical abuse. It was a response to the growing awareness of domestic violence and the need to protect women in an often patriarchal society.\n\nWith the introduction of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), the provisions of Section 498A were split into sections 85 and 86. Section 85 defines the act of \"husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty,\" while section 86 outlines the specific acts of cruelty. These provisions were intended to offer legal recourse for women facing domestic abuse.\n\nEvery year, over one lakh cases are registered under Section 498A. According to NCRB data, 1,40,019 cases were filed in 2022 alone. Over the last eight years, \"Cruelty by Husband or His Relatives\" has consistently been the most reported crime against women under the IPC. However, the average conviction rate for these cases has been just 15.7%.\n\nFor women\u2019s rights groups, the law is a crucial step in recognising domestic violence and framing cruelty as a criminal, gendered act \u2014 and the low conviction rates show the inefficiency of the system in dealing with these cases. For Men\u2019s Rights Activists (MRAs), however, the low conviction rate is evidence that the law has become a tool for revenge or extortion.\n\nWhy conviction rates are low\n\nIn her book The Trouble with Marriage: Feminists Confront Law and Violence in India, scholar Srimati Basu explores the challenges of enforcing Section 498A. She points out that one major reason for low conviction rates is the difficulty in providing clear evidence, especially in cases of mental cruelty. Convictions are more likely in cases involving additional charges, such as murder (Section 302) or dowry deaths (Section 304B).\n\nPractical barriers also hinder women from pursuing cases under Section 498A. Filing a complaint can often lead to the woman being denied access to her matrimonial home. Without alternative shelter or financial support, many are coerced into reconciliation. In some cases, families offer to settle the matter in exchange for an easy divorce, further complicating the process for women seeking justice. These systemic challenges force many women to either drop their cases or return to abusive environments, undermining the law\u2019s purpose.\n\nThe low conviction rate is frequently cited as proof of the law's misuse, but experts argue it is more reflective of the inherent difficulties in prosecuting cases of domestic violence. The Supreme Court, in a 2005 decision, acknowledged the potential for misuse but maintained that the law is essential for protecting women from abuse.\n\nMRAs claim the law is often weaponised in divorce cases, with allegations of cruelty used as leverage for alimony or property settlements. This perception, combined with the low conviction rate, fosters suspicion around the law\u2019s application. According to Srimati Basu, this atmosphere of doubt often leads to police apathy, especially toward victims from marginalised socio-economic backgrounds.\n\nAs Basu\u2019s book highlights, Section 498A underscores the complexities of addressing domestic violence in a deeply unequal society. \u201cSection 498A is huge in the popular imagination as a useful institutionalised tool to feminists and a symbol of terror, persecution, and impoverishment to those who oppose them \u2014 but it ultimately demonstrates the difficulties of negotiating plural options in the face of gendered material inequalities and proves to be weak in remedying violence,\u201d she writes.\n\nThe new petition\n\nOn December 13, Supreme Court advocate Vishal Tiwari filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court, alleging misuse of dowry laws and domestic violence statutes in India. He argued that false cases under IPC Section 498A and the Dowry Prohibition Act have led to widespread societal discord, mental health issues, and even suicides among accused men. Referencing cases like Atul Subhash's suicide, Tiwari stressed the urgency of reforming these laws to \"prevent misuse and protect innocent men.\"\n\nTiwari\u2019s petition described how the alleged misuse of dowry laws undermines the original intent behind their enactment. He argued that exaggerated claims of dowry during marital disputes often result in undue harassment of husbands and their families. To mitigate this, Tiwari proposed a system where every marriage registration application includes a detailed affidavit of all gifts, money, and items exchanged during the marriage. This affidavit, he suggested, could serve as an official record attached to the marriage certificate to avoid future disputes or fraudulent claims.\n\nThe petition referenced two significant cases to support its claims:\n\nPreeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand (2010): In this case, the Supreme Court acknowledged the growing number of matrimonial disputes and expressed concerns over exaggerated allegations in dowry and cruelty cases. The court added that criminal trials in these matters cause immense suffering for all parties involved, with even acquittals unable to erase the stigma and trauma. \u201cIt is high time that the legislature must take into consideration the pragmatic realities and make suitable changes in the existing law,\u201d the court had said.\n\nAppeal in Achin Gupta versus State of Haryana case: Tiwari noted that the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, which replaced the IPC, retains the essence of section 498A under its sections 85 and 86 with minimal changes. The Supreme Court had previously criticised this verbatim adoption, calling for legislative amendments to reflect earlier recommendations made in Preeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand.\n\nTiwari\u2019s petition sought not only the implementation of prior court observations but also the establishment of an expert committee. This committee, comprising retired judges, legal scholars, and jurists, should be tasked with reviewing existing dowry and domestic violence legislation to propose reforms aimed at curbing misuse, he has demanded.\n\nHow suicide numbers are calculated in India\n\nIndia\u2019s suicide data is primarily drawn from police records, with the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs tasked with compiling and analysing this information. The process begins when an unnatural death is reported to the local police, who investigate and classify it as a suicide if corroborated. These records are then passed through the District and State Crime Records Bureaus to the NCRB, which standardises the data and publishes annual reports. These records include details such as age, gender, marital status, and method of suicide, along with causes broadly categorised under headings like \u201cfamily problems\u201d, \u201cillness,\u201d and \u201cnon settlement of marriage\u201d.\n\nThe NCRB determines national suicide rates by calculating the number of suicides per 100,000 population using census data and mid-year population estimates.\n\nThis system has significant limitations. Suicides are often underreported due to societal stigma or potential legal repercussions, although the latter has been mitigated with the decriminalisation of suicide attempts. Researchers have also noted that female suicides are particularly prone to underreporting, given cultural and familial pressures. Another issue lies in the aggregation of data. The NCRB publishes only broad statistics, which restricts deeper analysis of individual cases or specific trends.\n\nAs Dr Soumitra Pathare described in his book, Life Interrupted: Understanding India's Suicide Crisis, what we record as suicide \"\u2026ultimately boils down to what the constable at the local police station will record as suicide.\"\n\nThe crucial work of suicide prevention\n\nAddressing these gaps is critical for improving suicide prevention is India and it must go beyond improving data accuracy. Suicide is a deeply complex issue that demands a responsible approach to it, especially when discussing it in public forums. Research show that irresponsible narratives about suicides, especially those that sensationalise or detail methods can trigger copy cat behaviour. This phenomenon known as \u201cWerther effect\u201d highlights the responsibility of media and social media platforms in shaping public understanding. Social media spaces such as Reddit, are rife with posts from individuals seeking to emulate the tragic cases of Atul Subhash.\n\nOrganisations like the Centre for Mental Health Law & Policy (CMHLP) are spearheading efforts to address this crisis. One of their key initiatives, Atmiyata, aims to foster mental health and well-being at the grassroots level. Atmiyata relies on community volunteers who provide emotional support and mental health assistance, bridging the gap for those who might not otherwise seek professional help. This initiative reflects a broader philosophy: suicide prevention is most effective when it\u2019s embedded within communities.\n\nAnother critical offering by CMHLP is their Gatekeeper Training Course for Suicide Prevention. These courses equip participants to recognise warning signs, offer support and guide individuals towards professional help. Similar gatekeeper courses are also offered by other organisations, such as Suicide Prevention India Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences broadening access to these life-saving skills.\n\nDr Kaustubh Joag, psychiatrist and program director at CMHLP, emphasises the importance of policy frameworks in addressing suicide prevention. \u201cAt the top level, we have the National Mental Health Policy of 2014 and the National Suicide Prevention Strategy of 2022. These were created at the Union government level, with the latter outlining detailed responses for various systems. While implementation is still a challenge, having a strategy and guidelines is a step forward. Some states, like Sikkim and Tamil Nadu, have even developed their own strategies based on the national framework,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Joag also highlighted the unique socio-economic context of suicides in India. \u201cGlobally, suicides are often linked to mental health conditions, but in India, mental health is not always the causative factor. Around 50% of people who die by suicide here don\u2019t necessarily have a diagnosable mental illness. Instead, their actions are often driven by life situations such as socioeconomic pressures, academic failures, or unemployment. To effectively prevent suicides, we must first understand these causative links and tailor our efforts accordingly.\"\n\nHe further stressed the importance of safe spaces, particularly for men in a patriarchal society where they are often discouraged from addressing vulnerabilities openly. \u201cCreating safe spaces is essential\u2014places where people can reach out for support during distress or suicidal thoughts. This requires sensitisation across community spaces like schools, colleges, and workplaces. Just as we've normalised good-touch and bad-touch training for children, we need similar suicide prevention training at all levels.\u201d\n\nHe advocated for a multi-pronged approach, citing WHO's contact and safety planning for suicide prevention as a key tool that can be taught to anyone, regardless of their mental health background. He also stresses the importance of helplines, which provide critical, immediate support during crises when individuals may find it difficult to reach out to someone in person.\n\nMedia plays a pivotal role in suicide prevention. Dr Joag cautioned that insensitive reporting can have devastating effects. \u201cIf suicides are not reported properly, it can trigger vulnerable individuals. There are training programs for journalists, but regional media outlets, especially those reporting in local languages, must also adopt these practices. Proper training can ensure coverage is sensitive and non-triggering.\u201d\n\nWhile the focus is on empowering communities to take proactive steps, there\u2019s also an implicit challenge here: for those who claim to care about high suicide rates\u2014whether it\u2019s men\u2019s rights activists or others\u2014these courses offer a tangible way to make a difference. Instead of merely amplifying grievances or assigning blame, enrolling in such programs is a direct and meaningful way to contribute to prevention efforts.\n\nIf you are aware of anyone facing mental health issues or feeling suicidal, please provide help. Here are some helpline numbers of suicide-prevention organisations that can offer emotional support to individuals and families.\n\nClick here for working helplines across India."

This week, we have abbreviated game previews and the good stuff! Yes, all the best (and worst) Christmas ranks! Oh, and actually, Week 17 fantasy football rankings, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReminder! I always have some \u201cfor fun\u201d ranks where I rate anything from cartoons to players from the \u201980s to things not to do when you\u2019re over 30 \u2014 feel free to suggest yours.

Click the comment icon/button at the top right, which takes you down to the comments and a short scroll-up to the rankings widget. Yay.\n\nWEEK 17 FANTASY FOOTBALL PREVIEWS\n\nChiefs at Steelers, Wednesday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Hollywood Brown had the second-most targets (eight), but ran just 40% of the routes. That makes him a decent upside gamble, even against the Steelers. If Brown sees 60-70% or more of the route participation, he can put up 100+ yards and a Top 20 performance. But it\u2019s risky.\n\n\u25ba If George Pickens plays, start him, but Najee Harris and Calvin Austin are benchable. Jaylen Warren is a solid Flex option.\n\nRavens at Texans, Wednesday, 4:30 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Mark Andrews has nine touchdowns in his last 10 games behind only Ja\u2019Marr Chase (11) and Terry McLaurin (10) and more than any other tight end by three TDs. Jonnu Smith and Sam LaPorta have six TDs each.\n\n\u25ba It may be hard to swallow, but Joe Mixon isn\u2019t a must-start. The Ravens have allowed a mere 65.5 RB rushing yards per game, and only Saquon Barkley ran for more than 63 against them. Additionally, Mixon has 8.1 fantasy points or fewer in three of the last four games, despite at least 15 touches in each.\n\nSeahawks at Bears, Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba D\u2019Andre Swift hasn\u2019t scored double-digit fantasy points since Week 11 and is just RB35 in fantasy points per game since Week 9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChargers at Patriots, Saturday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba If J.K. Dobbins returns, he\u2019s a high-risk/reward RB3. If he\u2019s out, Gus Edwards is a touchdown-reliant RB3, and I wouldn\u2019t immediately chase his Week 16 production, as he had a season-high in rushing yards and doubled his touchdown total.\n\n\u25ba The Patriots are risky, even in the backfield, as Rhamondre Stevenson has ranged anywhere from 40.0 to 82.1 RBTouch% this year. While he\u2019s more reliable when games are close or with the lead, it\u2019s hard to predict when the Patriots can accomplish such a feat, staying close with the Bills but getting blown out by the Jaguars.\n\nBroncos at Bengals, Saturday, 4:30 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba With 10.8 points, Audric Estime led the Broncos, but there are just two instances where the lead back has led the backfield in back-to-back weeks \u2014 Javonte Williams, Weeks 4 and 5, 9.0 and 13.6 fantasy points, respectively and Jaleel McLaughlin, Weeks 12 and 13, 4.4 and 8.9. You can\u2019t trust anyone.\n\nCardinals at Rams, Saturday, 8 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba I addressed the RB situation in my waiver wire column, but additionally, the Rams have only allowed RBs Alvin Kamara and Saquon Barkley big days since Week 9. It\u2019s not a smash spot for Trey Benson or Michael Carter if either is the lead.\n\n\u25ba Matthew Stafford had his first back-to-back sub-200-yard game since Weeks 8 (injured) and 11 last year. The next game? Stafford threw for 229 and four touchdowns against \u2026 the Cardinals. Now, that is coincidental, but the Cardinals are a great rebound matchup for Stafford, Puka Nacua and even Cooper Kupp.\n\nJets at Bills, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Breece Hall wasn\u2019t on the injury report all week, and he ended up with his sixth-highest RBTouch% (76.0). If Aaron Rodgers plays, business as usual, but if he\u2019s out, small downgrade to Davante Adams (volume), but Garrett Wilson\u2019s outlook changes little.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u25ba It\u2019s not just Amari Cooper you can\u2019t trust in Buffalo. You can\u2019t trust any Bills wideout, possibly even Khalil Shakir. Mack Hollins is still ahead of Keon Coleman, and Cooper is behind Dawson Knox in route involvement. Shakir had just his second sub-8 fantasy point showing since Week 7, but Week 6 saw him contained by the Jets with a 2/2/19 statline and 2.9 points.\n\nRaiders at Saints, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Even against the Saints, the list of must-start players is one: Brock Bowers. Jakobi Meyers, Alexander Mattison and Ameer Abdullah are all deeper options with a bit more upside than usual given the matchup.\n\n\u25ba As you saw against the Packers, if you attempt to start a Saints player, you\u2019re asking to get coal.\n\nColts at Giants, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The last time a team didn\u2019t have a running back hit double-digit PPR points against the Giants? Week 18 of last year. That\u2019s not only for those rostering Jonathan Taylor but also Anthony Richardson, as the Giants even let Joe Burrow and Geno Smith run for 55+ yards.\n\n\u25ba No, I didn\u2019t trust Tyrone Tracy playing through an injury, and I\u2019m sorry. The Colts are a good spot for him, which means, we\u2019ll start Tracy and watch him go 11-for-37 without scoring. Yay feetsballing!\n\nCowboys at Eagles, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Last week was Dowdle\u2019s first non 100-rushing-yards game Since Week 12, and his first non-double-digit score since Week 11. It doesn\u2019t get any easier for him, as the Eagles run defense is one of the worst matchups. Dowdle is a fringe RB2, especially if the carcass of Ezekiel Elliott is stealing goal-line carries.\n\n\u25ba If Jalen Hurts plays, fire up everyone as normal. If Kenny Pickett is under center, A.J. Brown is still a must-start, but DeVonta Smith becomes a risky WR4.\n\nPanthers at Buccaneers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Chuba Hubbard obviously had his best game since the bye. In fact, it was his best game of the season. He scored more points than the three previous games, combined. The Buccaneers have been tough, and Hubbard had 12 carries for 43 yards against them \u2014 all rushing \u2014 in Week 13. The volume is here, but so might be an RB2 finish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u25ba Jalen McMillan the last three weeks: 50.1 points (WR11) and 16.7 FPPG (WR13). You\u2019re starting him.\n\nTitans at Jaguars, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Tony Pollard still has a higher RBTouch% (54) than Tyjae Spears (46) over the last two weeks, but with Pollard not practicing, playing through injury, and game scripts, Spears has been much better, including seeing four goal-line rushes to just one for Pollard.\n\n\u25ba Brian Thomas Jr. is one of the fantasy MVPs as WR4 in FPPG since Week 11 and WR14 in FPPG on the season; he\u2019s WR6 overall.\n\nDolphins at Browns, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba If Jameis Winston plays due to Dorian Thompson-Robinson sitting, Jerry Jeudy is back to WR2 status even against the Dolphins. David Njoku is a must-start, but Elijah Moore would be a gamble with or without Cedric Tillman playing. As mentioned, the Dolphins have played the pass quite well.\n\nPackers at Vikings, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Per waivers, if Christian Watson plays, he\u2019s an appealing WR4 with more boom potential than most weeks. If he\u2019s out, Dontayvion Wicks is a fun chase for those needing the upside. Jayden Reed and Tucker Kraft are the only two worth using outside of Watson and Wicks.\n\n\u25ba T.J. Hockenson has just 5.6 FPPG on 17.7 TmTGT% over the last four games and is a man coverage matchup problem. Unfortunately, the Packers are only 23rd in Man% (22.2), which means Hockenson is in the streaming tight end conversation.\n\nFalcons at Commanders, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Drake London had his third-highest YPRR mark this year (2.68) and second-highest if you remove the Week 9 game where he left early (hip) \u2014 he\u2019s a must-start if playing. Darnell Mooney is a very strong WR3 also with his third-highest YPRR mark of the year (3.15) with Michael Penix Jr. under center.\n\n\u25ba It was ugly for Brian Robinson, but even with two fumbles \u2014 for turnovers! \u2014 Robinson had 57.1 RBTouch% and can rebound into RB2 territory against the Falcons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLions at 49ers, Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Lions run the most man \u2014 which you likely know by now \u2014 and George Kittle is much less effective against man with 1.67 YPRR compared to 3.08 against zone coverage. The good news is that Brock Purdy has 7.9 TD/ATT% against man compared to 3.0 against zone.\n\n\u25ba After last week, it might be tempting to start Deebo Samuel, and I\u2019m okay with the upside chase \u2014 plus, some fun with a last-man standing on MNF \u2014 but I\u2019m less excited for Samuel if Isaac Guerendo plays.\n\nFUN WITH RANKS\n\nIt\u2019s Christmas time! And I\u2019m gathering \u2014 and updating \u2014 all the Christmases of lists from past years into one huge Christmas.\n\nBest Christmas Movies \u2014 SINCE 2000\n\n\u201cKlaus\u201d \u2014 Origin story of Santa with a fun twist. Good animation, good feels. Top 5 all time, and possibly higher. Nicole and I watched it for the first time this year and can\u2019t recommend it enough. \u201cElf\u201d \u2014 Even if you think Will Ferrell is overrated, this is a great Christmas movie and is the source of numerous GIFs. \u201cViolent Night\u201d \u2014 John Wick is Santa \u2014 essentially \u2014 enough said! \u201cBad Santa\u201d \u2014 Con-man (Billy Bob Thorton) pretends to be Santa at a mall to rob the stores during Christmas \u2026 and yeah \u2026 pretty amusing. \u201cRed One\u201d \u2014 Hate on The Rock/this movie all you want, but it was a fun time. \u201cSurviving Christmas\u201d \u2014 Easily the most underrated Christmas movie ever. Ben Affleck is likable, James Gandolfini is the dad, plenty of laughs in a story about a guy trying to \u201cbuy a family\u201d for Christmas. \u201c8-Bit Christmas\u201d \u2014 Cheesy for sure, but if you were a \u201990s kid like me, you\u2019ll appreciate it more. \u201cSpirited\u201d \u2014 I was ready for cringe, and there is plenty, but it\u2019s also not a half-bad Christmas movie. \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever\u201d \u2014 100% a true-blue, family Christmas movie, and it doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything else. Just a good one. \u201cNutcrackers\u201d \u2014 Might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea \u2026 or eggnog. But the movie features real-life brothers (four of them) and is based somewhat on a \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d revision the middle child wrote. A bit hokey, but funny, and a good Christmas story.\n\nHonorable Mention: \u201cCarry-On\u201d \u2014 If you\u2019re counting \u201cDie Hard\u201d as a Christmas movie, then this counts. I wouldn\u2019t count either one, as they\u2019re not, but I also just wanted to poke at those people a bit.\n\nDFL: \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d \u2014 Hate me all you want, but I can\u2019t stand it.\n\nPre-2000 Greats: \u201cA Christmas Vacation\u201d (all-time great), \u201cHome Alone\u201d (another all-time great), \u201cThe Muppet Christmas Carol\u201d (can watch this every year), \u201cThe Santa Clause\u201d (the sequels are huge drop-offs, but this is a classic now), \u201cThe Nightmare before Christmas\u201d (though, Halloween movie?), \u201cScrooged\u201d (modern-day Christmas Carol).\n\nBest Christmas TV Episodes and Specials\n\n\u201cDuckTales: How Santa Stole Christmas\u201d (also, \u201cLast Christmas\u201d) \u2014 You had to know I\u2019d put this at the top \u2026 and no, it\u2019s probably not my true No. 1, but this is for the travesty of canceling the show, and I\u2019ll be watching this with my niece and nephew anyway. But, turns out, Scrooge and Santa are old friends, then enemies. Scrooge helped start Christmas, and\u2026 watch it! \u201cFriends: The One with the Holiday Armadillo\u201d \u2014 Ross wants to teach his son about Hanukkah, dresses as an armadillo, Chandler shows up as Santa and Joey surprises as Superman \u2026 for the Easter Bunny\u2019s funeral. \u201cFuturama: Xmas Story\u201d \u2014 John Goodman guest voices as an evil robot Santa who murders people on Christmas. Plus, Zoidberg is the hero\u2026 WUT?! And it is another seed in the series-long romance story of Fry and Leela. \u201cSeinfeld: The Strike (Festivus)\u201d \u2014 Festivus for the rest of us! Airing of grievances! Can\u2019t end Festivus until George\u2019s dad is pinned! Two-face! Kramer working in the bagel shop! There is just so much greatness. \u201cCommunity: Abed\u2019s Uncontrollable Christmas\u201d \u2014 Stop-motion/claymation style special with everything \u201cCommunity\u201d and old Christmas special rolled into one. \u201cThe Office: Christmas Party\u201d \u2014 Another show that includes an underlying romance story piece, and then the fighting over Michael trying to buy Ryan\u2019s love (with an iPod), all thanks to Michael turning it into a Yankee Swap from Secret Santa because he hates his gift. \u201cSupernatural: A Very Supernatural Christmas\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m going to miss this show. Basically, Sam and Dean are hunting down anti-Claus, not too different from \u201cFuturama\u201d\u2018s Santa, who is taking humans as sacrifices \u2013 few shows balance humor, thrills and the feels like Supernatural did. \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine: Yippie Kayak\u201d \u2014 Jake forgot Boyle\u2019s gift, Jake gets Gina to help find a gift but Boyle comes along when they end up in the middle of a robbery with a hostage situation, and Jake is giddy to recreate \u201cDie Hard.\u201d \u201cSouth Park: Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\u201d \u2014 In a theme that still holds up today, \u201cSouth Park\u201d wants to eliminate Christmas to be politically indifferent. Mr. Hankey, theme song and all, saves Christmas and becomes a recurring \u201ccharacter.\u201d \u201cA Charlie Brown Christmas\u201d \u2014 Kinda falls in the middle of a TV special and movie. Iconic cartoon, songs, characters, etc.\n\nHonorable Mention\n\n\u201cHow I Met Your Mother: How Lily Stole Christmas\u201d \u2014 Ted is telling Marshall to get over Lily, saying, \u201cYou gotta get over that Grinch.\u201d But the truth, from Future Ted, is that he said something else, and it happens again but the gift Marshall gets Lily makes everything right.\n\n\u201cChuck: Chuck Versus Santa Claus\u201d \u2014 Fugitive crashes into the Buy More, Sarah sneaks in to rescue Chuck, who ends up shooting Mauser (Fulcrum) to protect Chuck, which makes him think Sarah is a murderer \u2026 not exactly what you would think for a Christmas episode, but if you watched \u201cChuck\u201d and know the episode, you know why it\u2019s here.\n\nBest Christmas Desserts\n\nEggnog cookies/meltaways \u2014 oh.my.Santa! If you haven\u2019t had these, make it a point to change that this Christmas! Cream cheese cookies \u2014 trying to describe these doesn\u2019t do them service\u2026 drool-worthy (#CheckTheLink for recipe). Cinnamon roll anything \u2014 Though, try this cinnamon roll apple pie. Gingerbread swiss roll \u2014 I\u2019m not a fan of gingerbread cookies, but this swiss roll? Yum! Snowball cookies \u2014 Filled with chopped nuts (I usually had walnuts or pecans). Sugar cookie cut-outs \u2014 not the most delicious, but the must-have cookie of Christmas given the holiday shapes, red and green sugar, etc. Snickerdoodle \u2014 similar to the chocolate chip cookie, a classically great cookie that some people only have during the holidays, which is strange. Red and Green M&M chocolate chip cookies \u2014 the wonderful classic made festive with the M&M colors. Rugelach \u2014 my mom has made these for as long as I can remember, and they\u2019re vastly underrated (and yes, I had to look up the spelling). Jelly thumbprints \u2014 you can pretend you\u2019re being a bit healthy with some fruit.\n\nBest Christmas Songs\n\n\u201cThe Christmas Song\u201d (Nat King Cole) \u2014 The King of Christmas and the king of Christmas songs. \u201cIt\u2019s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\u201d (Andy Williams) \u2014 Another song that is all fun and enjoyment, and I could listen to it 10 times in an hour and not be sick of it (moved up a few spots because I\u2019m just not sick of it this year). \u201cAll I Want for Christmas is You\u201d (Mariah Carey) \u2014 You can act like you don\u2019t love it. You can pretend Carey isn\u2019t amazing. You can say it isn\u2019t the best original Christmas song in decades before it and since. But it would all be pure lies! \u201cJingle Bell Rock\u201d (Bobby Helms) \u2014 Arguably one of the most iconic Christmas song intros. You know immediately what\u2019s about to be played, and a smile comes with it. \u201cA Holly Jolly Christmas\u201d (Burl Ives) \u2014 Worlds better than the Christmas special this comes from and its song, \u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\u201d This should rank higher on everyone\u2019s list. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s the personification of Christmas joy in a song. And honestly, \u201cRudolph\u201d (the song) is short and repetitive. \u201cSanta Claus is Coming to Town\u201d (The Jackson 5) \u2014 Plenty of versions to choose from, but this one is undeniably the best with the talent of the Jacksons and it being a Christmas song sung by kids. \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u201d (Frank Sinatra) \u2014 Not every song has to be peppy and about pure fun. First off, Frank Sinatra might have the best male voice of all time (I own his \u201cBest of\u201d collection), and second, this song warms the heart (was seventh, but I\u2019m feeling peppier this year). \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d (Brenda Lee) \u2014 Back to the pep, one of the all-time best Christmas movies had a great scene with this song \u2026 \u201cHome Alone.\u201d \u201cSleigh Ride/Winter Wonderland\u201d (Dolly Parton) \u2014 \u201cWinter Wonderland\u201d is quality on its own, as is \u201cSleigh Ride.\u201d How do you make them better? Make them two songs in one and a rare Christmas song lasting nearly four minutes. Kudos, Dolly. \u201cChristmas (Baby Please Come Home)\u201d (Mariah Carey) \u2014 The original is good (Darlene Love), but Mariah Carey makes everything better. Honestly, tell me one song that couldn\u2019t be improved by Carey singing it.\n\nMOAR! Honorable Mentions, and Ones You Don\u2019t Admit You Like\n\n\u201cChristmas in Hollis\u201d (Run-DMC) \u2013 It\u2019s one of those songs you never turn off if it comes on, always start bobbing to and even try to sing along, but it\u2019s doesn\u2019t really have the loop factor, and if we\u2019re honest, very few people know all of the words.\n\n\u201cHere Comes Santa Claus,\u201d \u201cFrosty the Snowman\u201d (Gene Autry)\n\n\u201cWhite Christmas\u201d (Bing Crosby) \u2013 A true classic. I know plenty will be enraged that it\u2019s not in my top 10, but as you will see, I\u2019m more of the fun/up-tempo type.\n\n\u201cMele Kalikimaka\u201d (Bing Crosby)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\u201d (Michael Buble)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll Be Home for Christmas\u201d (various artists)\n\n\u201cLast Christmas\u201d (Wham!)\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas, Happy Holidays\u201d (*NSYNC)\n\n\u201cMy Only Wish (This Year)\u201d (Britney Spears)\n\n\u201cUnderneath the Tree\u201d (Kelly Clarkson)\n\nWorst Christmas Songs\n\n\u201cAll I Want for Christmas (Is My Two Front Teeth)\u201d \u2014 Is that Towelie from \u201cSouth Park\u201d? The tune is almost as unbearable as the voice and whistling teeth. I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas\u201d \u2014 Peak annoying voice, tune and nonsensical lyrics. \u201cDo They Know It\u2019s Christmas?\u201d \u2014 You know why. \u201cHere We Come A-wassailing\u201d \u2014 Somehow makes 1 minute and 12 seconds feel like hours. \u201cDominick the Donkey\u201d \u2014 If you like this, we can\u2019t be friends \u2026 and I have Italian in my family, so don\u2019t come with that. \u201cTwelve Days of Christmas \u201c\u2014 How did I forget this one?!

The smartphone market boom is a good testimony for it. That tech appetite is increasingly seen in the passenger vehicle market too, and it\u2019s not limited to the luxury segment. As ETAuto predicted last year , ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) qualified as a leading automotive tech trend of 2024.\u201cOn an average, over the last three months, ADAS for us is almost 1/4 of our overall portfolio, and that includes models which we launched much earlier,\u201d Nalinikanth Gollagunta , CEO of Mahindra & Mahindra\u2019s (M&M) Automotive Division told ETAuto.The emerging ADAS tech trend, which is still also a major USP for volume models, is expected to see a penetration level of 3% in the 4 million units Indian PV market, and around 5-6% in 2025, with the PV market clocking about 4.6 million units, according to market research firm Markets and Markets. The adoption level was around 2% in 2023.Automotive business intelligence firm Jato Dynamics\u2019 granular research shows standard rear parking distance sensor (52%), standard rear parking distance sensor & camera (47%), and auto activation hazard lights (39%) as the top three driving assistance features in terms of their industry penetration rate in India. On the Connected Vehicle tech side, remote services (29%), remote HVAC (16%), and remote start (7%), are listed as the leading ones.Mahindra & Mahindra, and MG Motor India (now JSW MG Motor India) are the lead players in the volume PV market when it comes to building businesses based on a strategy of democratising technology. The latter, which leveraged the Connected Vehicle and ADAS trends for brand MG\u2019s India market introduction, cites a projection that vehicles with advanced connected features will have an over 55% share by Q1 of 2027. And, vehicles with ADAS tech are expected to have an approximately 10% share.With these two major trends on the rise, Gaurav Gupta , Chief Growth Officer, JSW MG Motor India, says \u201cI will not be surprised if more than 80 % of customers would like to have a connected car. And, by 2030, we expect more than 30% new launches to have some level of ADAS.\u201dTechnology is increasingly becoming a crucial part in the savvy Indian consumer's vehicle purchase decision. \"Awareness has increased dramatically. Today customers decide their vehicle purchase within 3 main parameters Comfort, Safety, and Convenience. Comfort related to seating, Safety related to NCAP rating, and Convenience related to Connected Vehicle tech,\" says Kaushik Madhavan, VP - Automotive and Transportation, Markets and Markets.According to Gollagunta, the industry trend of ADAS is proving to be more than democratising technology. \u201cIt's democratising tech in our minds and bringing the volume up. But the second thing is, customers were looking at it as a safety feature (like the 360-degree camera view). The growing consumer awareness, and demand for ADAS has led M&M to \u2018democratise\u2019 the tech, by offering it in its compact SUV 3XO, and in all the AX variants of the Thar Roxx.The XUV700, launched in August \u201821, was the first Mahindra model to offer ADAS, in its top two variants. In the coming year or so, ADAS tech could become standard across all Mahindra models and variants as the solution also becomes more affordable with suppliers leveraging the economy of scale.2025 will see OEMs pushing the ADAS and connected tech envelopes even further. For example, M&M\u2019s \u2018electric origin\u2019 SUVs \u2013 BE 6 and XEV 9e, scheduled for launch in February, will have five radars to assist a more advanced tech suite. The OEM\u2019s ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) models with ADAS tech have one each.It\u2019s not only ADAS and Connected Vehicle tech that vehicles will rely on to woo customers in 2025. Display technology will also flex its muscle with different offerings to the driver, and other occupants in the vehicle. It\u2019s already beginning to happen. \u201cThe next battlefield in some form or shape, and it\u2019s already happening right now, is the amount of screen real estate which is there in each car,\u201d says Gollagunta.Like luxury cars, volume PV models will increasingly have more screens in the instrument panel/dashboard, and also offer screens for rear seat occupants. Global display technology major Visteon\u2019s CEO Sachin Lawande says, \u201cEvery car will have at least one large display, more likely two, if not more.\u201d For example, the upcoming Mahindra EVs will come with three screens, in their pillar-to-pillar display unit. Another two can be for the rear passengers.This growing trend of advanced display technology also makes Visteon see India as a 10 million unit automotive display market of display sizes 10 inches and higher, by the end of this decade.The growing global AI wave is also set to influence the in-car experience now. In the battle for customers\u2019 attention and interest, Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) will see major usage by OEMs in 2025. Especially to enhance the user experience. As Lawande puts it, \u201cAI is the new UI\u201d. The software driven technology can be almost revolutionary. \u201cThink about everything that you are currently doing with the system in the car, enhanced through AI,\u201d says the global industry leader.After Connected Vehicle tech, which is getting enhanced with 5G connectivity, and ADAS, Gollagunta counts AI as the third dimension of new automotive trends, which will also see major gains in 2025. \u201cVehicles will start to have a lot more augmented reality and AI capabilities built in,\u201d he says, and cites the example of heads-up display (HUD) with augmented reality in the Mahindra BE 6. AI for cameras in the vehicle, for facial recognition, driver drowsiness etc. will also see adoption in volume passenger vehicle models.As much as there the Indian market may offer great opportunity, thanks to its hunger for new technology, industry players will have to also meet the additional cost challenge that new technology usually comes with.\u201cNext year is going to be a year of consolidation, meaning that the inflation that has happened in costs, in getting here, whether it is battery costs, electronics cost, displays costs, we need to be able to drive strategies to make this cost become more affordable, so that the promise of the growth that we are all expecting can actually be delivered,\u201d says Lawande.To ride the India opportunity better, and also leverage the country\u2019s competitive production costs, Visteon looks to strike a collaboration or two with partners here for local production of its display products.Collaboration as a business growth or technology development strategy will see more traction in 2025. According to Raghavendra Vaidya , MD and CEO, Daimler Trucks Innovation Center, Daimler Truck\u2019s GCC (Global Capability Center) in India, collaboration across industries is set to be a major force driving India\u2019s automotive evolution, with strategic partnerships accelerating advancements in EV infrastructure, autonomous driving, and next-generation mobility solutions.He also adds that a significant emerging trend is the willingness of leading automotive companies to advance the development of cutting-edge software platforms, enhance vehicle connectivity, and build an integrated digital ecosystem.All the advanced automotive technology features that are beginning to emerge, and more to come in 2025 and beyond, will be enabled only by the software defined vehicle (SDV). This trend will also help OEMs to be more cost effective, while also helping democratise technology as multiple features can be based on the same software platform/architecture.If consumers lap up more software defined vehicles, the better it would be for both the buyers and vehicle manufacturers. \u201cThe more volume you get, you actually get more competitive and therefore technology democratisation, while it's good for customers, it's also good for us,\u201d says Gollagunta.Lawande expects softwarisation, along with digitalisation and electrification to gain more traction in 2025.With all the fares lined up for 2025, some already showcased, and more to come up in events next year, staring with the international mela of Bharat Mobility Expo, scheduled for 17-22 January, industry players would be hoping for a good drive in the coming year.,"

            "article_content": "Image: Cottonbro studio / Pexels\n\nThe convergence of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, as demonstrated by the meteoric rise of meme tokens like Pepe Coin, is ushering in a new era of decentralized computing that promises to democratize access to advanced machine learning capabilities. This revolutionary combination is not just changing how AI models are trained and deployed \u2013 it's fundamentally transforming the economic landscape of technological innovation.\n\nAs we examine this technological synergy more closely, it becomes clear how decentralized systems are reshaping the traditional power structures in AI development.\n\nThe Foundation of Decentralized AI\n\nTech giants with vast computing resources and proprietary datasets have long dominated traditional AI development. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have maintained a virtual monopoly on advanced AI capabilities, creating a significant barrier to entry for smaller players and independent researchers. However, the introduction of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency incentives is rapidly changing this paradigm.\n\nDecentralized machine learning platforms leverage blockchain's distributed nature to create vast networks of computing power. These networks function like a global supercomputer, where participants can contribute their unused computing resources in exchange for cryptocurrency tokens. This model not only makes AI development more accessible but also more efficient and cost-effective.\n\nThe Economic Incentive Model\n\nThe brilliance of combining cryptocurrency with decentralized AI lies in its economic incentive structure. Participants in these networks are rewarded with native tokens for contributing resources, whether that's computing power, data, or AI models. This creates a positive feedback loop where:\n\nContributors are incentivized to provide more resources to the network Developers gain access to affordable computing power and datasets Users benefit from increasingly sophisticated AI services The overall ecosystem grows in value as more participants join\n\nNetwork participants can earn tokens by providing various resources:\n\nComputing power for training AI models\n\nStorage space for distributed datasets\n\nHigh-quality data for training purposes\n\nValidated AI models ready for deployment\n\nVerification services for ensuring data quality\n\nTechnical Infrastructure and Implementation\n\nThe technical architecture of these platforms typically consists of several key components. Smart contracts manage the distribution of computational tasks and token rewards, ensuring transparent and automatic execution of agreements between parties. Distributed storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) handle the massive datasets required for AI training, while blockchain networks maintain an immutable record of transactions and model provenance.\n\nFederated learning techniques are often employed to train AI models across distributed networks without centralizing sensitive data. This approach allows multiple parties to contribute to model development while maintaining data privacy and reducing bandwidth requirements.\n\nChallenges and Future Developments\n\nDespite the promising potential, decentralized AI platforms face several challenges that need to be addressed for widespread adoption:\n\nSecurity concerns remain paramount, as distributed networks must protect against malicious actors while maintaining performance. Platform developers are implementing sophisticated verification mechanisms and reputation systems to ensure network integrity.\n\nScalability presents another significant challenge, as blockchain networks must handle the massive computational requirements of AI training while maintaining reasonable transaction speeds and costs. Layer-2 solutions and improved consensus mechanisms are being developed to address these limitations.\n\nThe regulatory landscape around both cryptocurrency and AI remains uncertain in many jurisdictions, potentially affecting platform development and adoption. Industry leaders are actively engaging with regulators to establish clear frameworks that protect users while fostering innovation.\n\nImpact on the AI Industry\n\nThe rise of decentralized machine learning platforms is democratizing access to AI technology in unprecedented ways. Small businesses and independent researchers can now access computing resources and datasets that were previously available only to large corporations. This democratization is leading to the following:\n\nIncreased diversity in AI development and applications\n\nMore rapid innovation through collaborative development\n\nLower barriers to entry for AI startups\n\nGreater competition in the AI services market\n\nImproved transparency in AI model development\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe future of decentralized AI platforms appears bright, with several emerging trends likely to shape the industry:\n\nEdge computing integration will enable more efficient processing of AI tasks by leveraging distributed computing resources closer to data sources. This will reduce latency and improve real-time applications.\n\nCross-chain interoperability will allow AI resources to be shared across different blockchain networks, creating a more connected and efficient ecosystem. This will enable greater flexibility in resource allocation and token utilization.\n\nAs these platforms mature, we can expect to see increasingly sophisticated applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and scientific research. The combination of blockchain's security and transparency with AI's analytical capabilities creates possibilities for solving complex problems in ways previously not possible.\n\nThe convergence of blockchain and AI through decentralized machine learning platforms represents a significant shift in how we develop and deploy artificial intelligence. By democratizing access to AI resources and creating economic incentives for participation, these platforms are fostering a new era of collaborative innovation that promises to accelerate technological progress while making it more accessible to all."

            "article_content": "Sophisticated cyberattacks leveraging AI-powered deepfakes, phishing, data manipulation, and malware are on the rise. To combat these complex threats, Indian companies are looking to upgrade their security infrastructure, experts said.\n\nCybersecurity attacks that started around the 1980s have evolved in the past forty-odd years. Earlier, what was only about corrupting standalone devices with viruses now has the capacity to cripple an entire organization and even country.\n\n\u201cCyberattacks are currently in the 5th or 6th generation of what is known as multi-vector attacks. These are not only targeting your endpoint devices, but also your networks, data centres, cloud, etc. All of it is happening in parallel, making it much more complex and sophisticated, and difficult to prevent,\" said Devroop Dhar, co-founder of management consulting firm Primus Partners.\n\nMulti-vector attacks are highly sophisticated cyber threats that exploit multiple vulnerabilities simultaneously to breach an organization's defences. A typical example is a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that combines multiple techniques, such as flooding networks and overwhelming systems, to maximize disruption.\n\nAI: A double-edged sword\n\nCoupled with other sophisticated technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) can both be a boon or a bane depending on who is using it. Many cyber criminals are using AI technology to intensify their attacks. On the other hand, companies are using AI to build advanced cybercrime protection systems.\n\n\u201cAI is a double-edged sword. It is both a tool for companies to prevent and respond to attacks and also a tool for cyber attackers to increase the intensity of their attacks,\" Dhar highlighted.\n\nCompanies are using AI tools to scan through humongous amounts of data to identify unusual patterns and detect cyber attacks, he added.\n\nAs far as cyber criminals are concerned, they are using AI rampantly to generate sophisticated attacks using technologies like deepfake.\n\n\u201cEarlier, the algorithmic attacks were mostly numeric, so attackers would write scripts to go through millions of combinations of passwords to attack a user id. But now, with AI, the ability to create attacks such as deepfakes, is much higher and to automate them is significantly higher,\" said Ajay Trehan, chief executive officer of authentication firm Authbridge that helps companies with identity management. He added that he sees this trend grow further in 2025.\n\nCybercrime is becoming a rising concern for organizations. In the Indian outlook of PwC's Global economic crime survey 2024, the consulting firm noted that 33% of senior executives surveyed in India highlighted cybercrime as one of the biggest problems faced by businesses.\n\nTata Consultancy Services Ltd, which is the country\u2019s largest software services company, has highlighted cyber threats posed by Gen AI.\n\n\u201cGenAI is enhancing operational efficiencies, but organizations must equip themselves to counteract cyber threats. It is imperative for organizations to harness these advancements and implement GenAI-powered threat detection and response systems to stay ahead of the curve,\" said Ganesa Subramanian Vaikuntam, global head of cybersecurity at TCS, as part of the TCS 2025 Cybersecurity Outlook released on 10 December.\n\n\u201cGenAI is transforming organizational operations, but is also being exploited by cybercriminals for advanced attacks like deepfakes, phishing, data manipulation, and new malware. In response, organizations must fight fire with fire by deploying GenAI-powered threat detection and response systems,\" the TCS report added.\n\nRansomware attacks, supply-chain disruptions and identity thefts of executives are the biggest threats. Organizations are shuffling to ramp up and build a security system that is capable of countering the advanced attacks powered by AI and other advanced technologies.\n\n\u201cCompanies are taking steps to counter these cyber threats, especially supply-chain attacks. There is an increased focus on third-party security and governance. The third parties also connect to a company\u2019s own technology through APIs, so API security is also being ramped up,\" said Siddharth Vishwanath, partner, PwC.\n\nAPIs or application programming interfaces are sets of defined rules that enable different software systems, applications, or services to communicate with each other. They allow these systems to exchange data, perform actions, or request services in a standardized and secure way.\n\nWhile companies are looking to nullify these cyber threats, IT services companies have ramped up their cybersecurity offerings to clients, making use of AI.\n\nAccenture Plc, which is the world\u2019s largest technology services company, introduced four new cybersecurity services on 19 November. These services would detect cyber flaws and deepfakes in an AI system, provide solutions, and help clients build strategies around their cyber programmes.\n\nHomegrown software services companies have also been ramping up their cybersecurity offerings.\n\nTCS expanded its partnership with Google Cloud on 3 September by launching two AI-powered cybersecurity solutions -- TCS Managed Detection and Response and TCS Secure Cloud Foundation. These solutions would reduce the time taken by TCS\u2019s clients to detect, and respond to threats, and also strengthen cloud security by leveraging AI, machine learning, and automation.\n\nAlmost two months later, on 2 December, Noida-based HCL Technologies Ltd announced a similar collaboration with Google Cloud to provide AI-driven Managed Detection and Response (MDR) solutions to help clients detect and respond to cyber threats.\n\nA day later, Wipro Ltd announced a partnership with Netskope, a US-based cybersecurity company, to provide enterprises with an integrated service that analyzes the client\u2019s current cybersecurity and infrastructure investments, provides consolidation guidelines, and delivers cost-optimized methods"

            "article_content": "In less than four weeks, President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 47th president and become only the second U.S. leader to ever serve nonconsecutive terms. However, Wall Street decided to kick off the party a bit early.\n\nSince Election Day, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth stock-dependent Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) have all ascended to record-closing highs. This is a continuation of the robust gains Wall Street's major indexes enjoyed during Trump's first term. Between Jan. 20, 2017 and Jan. 20, 2021, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite soared 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\n\nBut to quote Wall Street's favorite warning: \"Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\"\n\nAlthough stocks thrived with Trump in the Oval Office, there's genuine concern that his desire to implement tariffs on Day One could undermine American businesses and cause the stock market to plunge. Based on what history tell us, this isn't out of the realm of possibilities.\n\nFormer President and President-elect Donald Trump giving remarks. Image source: Official White House Photo by Andrea Hanks.\n\nAnalysis: Trump's prior tariffs had a deleterious effect on U.S. equities\n\nLast month, President-elect Trump laid out his plan to impose a 25% tariff on imports from its direct neighbors, Canada and Mexico, as well as 35% tariff on imported goods from China, the world's No. 2 economy.\n\nThe general purpose of tariffs is to make American-made goods more price-competitive with those being brought in from beyond our borders. They're also designed to encourage multinational businesses to manufacture their goods destined for the U.S. within the confines of our borders.\n\nBut according to an analysis from Liberty Street Economics, which publishes research for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Trump's tariffs have previously had a decisively negative impact on U.S. equities exposed to countries where those tariffs were targeted.\n\nThe four authors of Do Import Tariffs Protect U.S. Firms? make it a point to distinguish between the impacts of tariffs on outputs versus inputs. An output tariff is an added cost placed on the final price of a good, such as a car imported into the country. Meanwhile, an input tariff would affect the cost of producing a final good (e.g., higher costs on imported steel). The authors note that higher input tariffs make it difficult for U.S. manufacturers to compete on price with foreign businesses.\n\nThe authors also examined the stock market returns of all publicly traded U.S. companies on the day Trump announced tariffs in 2018 and 2019. They found a clear negative shift in equity prices on the days tariffs were announced, with this effect being most pronounced on businesses that were exposed to China.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Complex data center workloads like training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence (AI) applications would take a very long time if powered only by central processing units (CPUs). To that end, specialized semiconductors are used to speed up computationally intensive AI tasks.\n\nIn that semiconductor vertical, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) have emerged as the industry standard. In fact, the company has between 80% and 95% market share in AI accelerators, according to analysts. But Nvidia shareholders recently got some worrisome news from rival Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO).\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nNvidia shareholders just got some bad news from Broadcom\n\nBroadcom sells a range of semiconductor products, including combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips in Apple and Samsung smartphones, as well as networking chips in Arista switches. But Wall Street is particularly fascinated by its leadership in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs.) ASICs are chips purpose-built for specific use cases like accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\n\nAnalysts estimate Broadcom has approximately 60% market share in custom AI chips due to its relationships with three hyperscalers, a term that refers to companies with vast data center footprints. While Broadcom has not identified its hyperscale customers, analysts generally believe they are Google parent Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok parent ByteDance.\n\nBroadcom estimates revenue from its three existing hyperscale customers will range from $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027, up from $12.2 billion in 2024. In other words, the company anticipates that custom AI chip sales will increase at least 70% annually in the next three years, but perhaps as quickly as 95% annually.\n\nThat is disappointing for Nvidia shareholders because it means Broadcom will likely gain market share in AI accelerators. In fact, analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that ASICs will account for 13% of AI accelerator sales in 2027, up from 11% in 2024. They also think that figure could hit 15% in 2030. But there is more bad news for Nvidia shareholders.\n\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan told analysts on the fourth-quarter earnings call that Broadcom has selected two new hyperscalers that are likely to be revenue-generating customers by 2027. That means revenue from custom AI chips could actually grow faster than 95% annually in the next few years. Importantly, while Broadcom did not identify the customers, analysts believe they are Apple and ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nA semiconductor underlit by gold light, with glowing letters AI on its face.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia shareholders still have good reason to be optimistic\n\nI mentioned that Broadcom selected two additional hyperscalers as potential customers. CEO Hock Tan himself used that word because Broadcom will not develop ASICs for small companies, nor would small companies have an interest in using custom AI chips.\n\nThere are two reasons for that. First, designing ASICs is expensive, so the customer must have a data center footprint large enough to warrant the expense. Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar recently told CNBC that each chip costs about $500 million to design, so it would not be financially sensible to work with clients that can only order a few thousand. Instead, orders must be in the range of 250,000 to 500,000 units.\n\nSecond, custom chips are less flexible because they are designed for specific workloads and lack supporting software development tools. Nvidia offers a robust ecosystem of code libraries and pretrained models that streamline GPU application development. No such tools exist for ASICs. That means deploying custom chips requires a high degree of technical expertise, which means Broadcom's customer base is limited.\n\nAdditionally, companies that experiment with ASICs may ultimately decide the costs outweigh the benefits. Antoine Chkaiban at New Street Research says only two companies have deployed custom AI silicon at scale: Google and Amazon. So Nvidia is well positioned to maintain its leadership in AI accelerators. Bank of America analysts estimate it will capture 75% market share in 2030, down only slightly from 80% in 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street thinks Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase at 34% annually through fiscal 2027, which ends in January 2027. That consensus makes the current valuation of 53 times adjusted earnings look very reasonable.

            "article_content": "Russia's economy will be under significant strain next year, economists told Business Insider.\n\nHigh inflation, slowing economic growth, energy prices, and sanctions could hurt its war machine.\n\nOne expert told BI that stagnation was similar to the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1980s.\n\nRussia's economy is likely entering a year of pain in 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin has restructured its economy to prioritize its war efforts, imposing export bans, tapping its national wealth fund, and strengthening trade with non-Western countries.\n\nBut unprecedented defense spending, labor shortages, and Western sanctions have come at a cost, and some believe the country is reaching the limits of its capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEconomists told Business Insider that while they don't expect Russia's economy to collapse, they said it would face a tough 2025 if it keeps on fighting in Ukraine.\n\nPersisting inflation\n\n\"Russia has set in motion processes that will continue to eat out its economy from within,\" Roman Sheremeta, an associate professor of economics at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University, told BI.\n\nHe said that if the war continues, \"it will put a significant strain on the already bleeding Russian budget.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia has increasingly boosted its defense spending to sustain its war efforts, from $59 billion in 2022 to $109 billion in 2023, and $126.8 billion set aside in 2025, when defense will make up 32.5% of Russia's federal budget, up from 28.3% this year.\n\nWhile soaring defense spending has fueled Russia's economy in recent years, it has also contributed to rising inflation, which Russian President Vladimir Putin said could hit 9.5% in 2025.\n\nTo rein this in, the country's central bank raised its key interest rate from 19% to 21% in October, a record high, which has eaten into companies' profit margins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bank was expected to raise the rate again in December, but held off, though it may need to increase it next year.\n\n\"The main question is how high the inflation will be and how the slowing down will materialize,\" Alexander Kolyandr, a financial analyst and non-resident senior scholar at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told BI.\n\nPutin has acknowledged that inflation is at \"a relatively high level.\" Speaking at an investment forum in Moscow earlier this month, he urged his government and the central bank to curb it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTsMAKP, a Russian think tank, warned last month that Russia's failure to tame inflation was driving the country toward stagflation, a scenario in which growth is low and inflation high, and which is harder to escape than a recession.\n\n\"The overall trend is pretty grim,\" said Kolyandr. \"I would say it's overall stagnation akin to what the Soviet Union had at the beginning of the 1980s.\"\n\nThe Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlowing economic growth\n\nRussia is expected to experience lower-than-expected economic growth in 2025. In its October World Economic Outlook, the IMF dropped its GDP growth estimate for Russia from 1.5% to 1.3%.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Overall growth will be quite slow,\" Iikka Korhonen, the head of research at the Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economies, told BI.\n\nHowever, he said the Kremlin will make sure that military production has enough resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut \"many sectors will most likely contract,\" he said.\n\nUS sanctions on Gazprombank and other financial institutions in November caused the ruble to plummet, according to The Wall Street Journal, which also said that companies were slashing expansion plans.\n\nIt reported that more than 200 shopping centers in Russia are under threat of bankruptcy due to rising debt burdens and almost a third of Russian freight haulers say they fear bankruptcy in 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia's largest mobile operator, MTS, also blamed an almost 90% drop in Q3 net profits on costs related to interest payments.\n\n\"The elites are fighting for survival, and while they remain loyal to Putin, they are increasingly discontent,\" Alexandra Prokopenko, a former Russian central bank official and now a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, told the Journal.\n\nIn fact, in recent months, Russian CEOs and business leaders have increased their vitriol against interest-rate hikes and Western sanctions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSergei Chemezov, CEO of defense conglomerate Roste, told Russian senators in late October that sky-high interest rates were leaving companies struggling to turn a profit.\n\nOil and gas prices\n\nWhile Russia's share of oil and gas revenues has fluctuated in recent years, and dropped in 2023, Russia expects it to account for about 27% of the country's total budget revenue in 2025.\n\n\"As long as Russia can sell as much crude oil as it is now selling with the current prices, they will have enough tax revenue for the war well into 2025,\" Korhonen said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this month, Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft agreed to a 10-year, $13 billion deal to supply crude oil to India, Reuters reported, citing three sources familiar with the deal.\n\nHowever, Center for European Policy Analysis' Kolyandr said he believes Russia's revenue outlook is \"over-optimistic,\" since \"global oil prices might be lower than the government thinks.\"\n\nTraders expect global oil prices to fall from a projected $80 a barrel in 2024 to between $65 and $71 in 2025, due to sluggish demand, production from non-OPEC+ countries, and a shift toward cleaner energies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile G7 countries have set a $60 price cap on Russian oil since December 2022, Russia has partly evaded the cap by using a shadow fleet, redirecting oil exports to countries like China and India, and inflating ancillary costs to obscure purchase prices.\n\nBut the tightening of Western sanctions could further reduce Russia's oil and gas revenues.\n\nReserves\n\nRussia's economic performance in 2025 will ultimately come down to the availability of resources, said Korhonen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There will be a deficit, but it can initially be financed from the National Welfare Fund,\" he said.\n\nRussia's National Warfare Fund has assets amounting to about $131.1 billion as of October, while the central bank has about $614.4 billion in international reserves.\n\nKolyandr, meanwhile, said that \"whether Russia is going to face any crisis in 2025\" would depend on everything that will happen in 2025, including oil prices, sanctions, President-elect Donald Trump's trade policies, and the Russian labor market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Russian economy will continue to fall,\" said Weatherhead School of Management's Sheremeta, \"which will restrict Russia's ability to wage war.\"\n\nBut he added: \"Much will depend on the Western support of Ukraine.\""

            "article_content": "SHI YU/CHINA DAILY\n\nEditor's note: The Third China-Indian Ocean Region Forum on Blue Economy Development Cooperation was held in Kunming, Yunnan province from Dec 15 to 16. The forum, themed \"Future of the Blue Indian Ocean \u2014 Development Practice of the Global South\", was jointly organized by the China International Development Cooperation Agency, the People's Government of Yunnan Province, the Ministry of Fisheries and Ocean Resources of the Maldives, and the Ministry of Environment and National Beautification, Green and Blue Economy of Barbados. Below are excerpts of speeches of some participants at the forum.\n\nForum in line with GDI\n\nThe Third China-Indian Ocean Region Forum on Blue Economy Development Cooperation is of tremendous importance to Barbados. For us (in Barbados), this is a tangible demonstration of China's commitment to forge greater synergy across multilateral development processes with the view to accelerate the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nChina's hosting of the forum is in keeping with its Global Development Initiative, which consolidates its international cooperation agenda and is based on the following six guiding principles: a people-centered approach; development as a priority; benefits for all; innovation-driven development; harmony with nature; and action-oriented approaches.\n\nThe agenda for this year's forum includes topics which directly impact the future of a significant number of countries across the world and by extension a significant percentage of the world's population. These include climate change, island resilience and disaster recovery, implementation of the Paris Agreement, and sustainable development of the blue economy.\n\nReginald Farley, president of the Senate of Barbados\n\nOceans sustain livelihoods\n\nFor more than 4,000 years, the oceans have sustained our (Maldivian people's) livelihoods and shaped our identity as the \"children of the sea\". Small developing island states like ours bear a disproportionate burden of climate change despite emitting the least volumes of carbon dioxide and other toxic gases. We have voiced this concern on countless platforms, countless times.\n\nThe Maldives is doing as much as it can, with the little resources it has, to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. As a global leader in maritime affairs, China has been a reliable partner to the Maldives, thanks to their strong bilateral relationship. The successive editions of the forum have reflected the Chinese government's, especially Chinese President Xi Jinping's, commitment to address common cross-border challenges with effective responses.\n\nHussain Mohamed Latheef, vice-president of Maldives\n\nPakistan upholds marine cooperation\n\nOceans are a shared lifeline, a source of connectivity and economic opportunities, a custodian of the vast marine resources. The \"blue economy\" holds immense potential for us (in Pakistan) in areas such as sustainable fisheries, marine tourism and renewable energy.\n\nYet this potential comes with great responsibility. Challenges such as climate change and pollution require urgent and collective action to protect these vital resources. Our partnership with China under the Belt and Road Initiative framework has fostered knowledge exchange, technology advancement, and marine resource conservation. The China-proposed Global Development Initiative aligns with our shared visions of transnational collaboration and environmental stewardship.\n\nPakistan stands ready to partner with all the stakeholders to promote marine cooperation and ensure that our region maintains peace and progress and sustainability. Let us protect and promote our vital marine resources for our future generations.\n\nAsif Ali Zardari, president of Pakistan\n\nTime for action\n\nThe oceans connect us all; they carry more than 80 percent of global trade, sustaining the livelihoods of millions of people in fisheries and coastal communities, and offer renewable energy solutions such as offshore wind and tidal power. This lifeline is under threat. The urgency for action could not be clearer.\n\nThe adoption of the High Seas Treaty and the ongoing plastic pollution treaty negotiations highlight the power of international cooperation. Success demands collaboration \u2014 across sectors, across borders and across generations. I commend the outcomes of the last China-Indian Ocean forum, which enhanced disaster prevention and early warning systems for regions devastated by tsunamis and floods.\n\nNow is the time for action \u2014 to forge partnerships that amplify the voices of vulnerable coastal and island nations, to prioritize resilience and investments that safeguard lives and livelihoods, while advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nAmina Mohammed, deputy secretary-general of the United Nations\n\nBlue economy a central theme\n\nIn recent years, the blue economy has emerged as a central theme for many countries across the world and for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. It has a transformative role in advancing sustainable development. There is an estimated annual turnover of between $3 trillion and $6 trillion.\n\nThe ocean economy represents about 4 percent of global GDP. So, if the oceans were a country, they would rank as the world's seventh-largest economy. The blue economy holds a huge potential to drive stable industrial employment, protect our environment and foster prosperity on a global scale. It is a critical resource especially for coastal economies, especially for small island developing states.\n\nThe blue economy contributes significantly to not only economic growth but also food security. Which makes this an opportunity we cannot ignore.\n\nGerd M\u00fcller, director-general of the UNIDO\n\nBoost regional capacity\n\nThe China-Indian Ocean region is a vital marine ecosystem and a hub for global trade, supporting the livelihoods of millions of people. However it faces escalating challenges including climate change, overfishing, marine pollution and governance gaps.\n\nTo address these challenges, it is important to foster inclusive strategies for the growth of blue economies involving local communities, the private sector and international organizations. Since its inception, China-Indian ocean forum has been instrumental in strengthening regional alignment in planning and action to deepen blue cooperation.\n\nI hope the forum will strengthen regional capacity, promote sustainable practices in the blue economy and forge stronger partnerships for effective ocean governance.\n\nArmida Alisjahbana, under secretary-general of the United Nations and Executive Secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific\n\nEarly warning system indispensable\n\nThe China-Indian Ocean Region Forum is timely, as it comes in the wake of the recent 16th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and the 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, both of which are deeply connected to the sustainable development of the blue economy. As such, the UNDP is delighted to join hands with the China International Development Cooperation Agency.\n\nAs for our global initiative, we are focused on strengthening early warning systems against natural disasters and helping developing countries to protect humans and marine life. We look forward to further deepening our partnership with China and building on our collective progress in protecting and restoring our planet's critical ecosystems including the oceans.\n\nXu Haoliang, associate administrator of the UNDP\n\nPractical cooperation needed\n\nThe oceans are an essential part of the Earth's ecosystem, while the blue economy is an important component of the world economy. Thirty-eight countries in Africa are coastal and/or island states.\n\nTherefore, strengthening transnational cooperation in the blue economy and fully utilizing marine resources are crucial for African countries to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The China-Indian Ocean Region Forum on Blue Economy Cooperation provides a platform for exchanges and cooperation among countries in the Indian Ocean region, including many African countries and has promoted marine ecological protection and blue economic development.\n\nWe look forward to reaching a broad consensus and boosting more practical cooperation results between Africa and China in the development of the blue economy.\n\nMonique Nsanzabaganwa, deputy chairperson for the African Union Commission\n\nOceans critical to climate governance\n\nZero is an important concept of the Chinese government and our (Bangladesh's) stakeholders. We will integrate our goals and plans with the future development path of the Global Development Initiative, so as to manage the oceans and maintain sustainable practices in a sustainable way. At this forum, representatives from various countries shared their experiences, expectations and future plans, and I saw how the blue economy digitalization can empower the blue economy.\n\nThe oceans are critical for tourism, disaster response, promoting climate governance, implementing the Paris Agreement, and other hot-button issues. In particular, Bangladesh will work with other countries to implement the outcomes of the forum and contribute to global sustainable development.\n\nKhalilur Rahman, high representative of the chief adviser to the Interim Government of Bangladesh\n\nBeacon of sustainable growth\n\nThe Indian Ocean has always been a cradle of trade, culture and human connections. Today, it is at the heart of our shared aspirations for sustainable growth and prosperity. The dialogues here have reaffirmed the importance of aligning our policies and investments with sustainable practices.\n\nCooperation with China and other countries in the Indian Ocean region is essential for achieving these goals. Through knowledge sharing, technological support, and innovative financing mechanisms, we can build a resilient and inclusive blue economy.\n\nLet this gathering mark the start of a decade of collaboration, where we can collectively ensure that our oceans remain a source of life, livelihoods, and inspiration for all. Together, let us act decisively and inclusively to ensure that the blue economy is a beacon of sustainable growth for all our people.\n\nMahinda Siriwardana, secretary to the treasury and the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development of Sri Lanka\n\nEarly warning system should be effective\n\nThe significance and vulnerability of our oceans are in stark contrast to the investments that go into keeping them safe and healthy. At present, SDG 14 \u2014 life below water \u2014 is the most underfunded of all the Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, we are particularly thrilled to have signed the first two financial agreements with the China International Development Cooperation Agency on a multi-country initiative to develop actionable early warning systems in a bid to help strengthen the coastal communities' resilience to climate change.\n\nIndeed, as climate-related natural disasters become increasingly frequent, having effective early warning systems in place and mainstreaming disaster risk mitigation into development strategies are more important than ever, to protect lives, livelihoods, and the ecosystems they rely on.\n\nMoving forward, we are ready to continue working with China, and all countries, to safeguard and restore critical ecosystems, including the oceans, and embed sustainable development in the blue economy. This cannot be accomplished by any one country alone. Only through shared resolve and global cooperation can we address the challenges of our times and realize the vision of the 2030 Agenda.\n\nBeate Trankmann, representative of UNDP in China\n\nMaldives committed to actions\n\nAs we reflect on the milestones of this decade and set our sights on its ambitious goals, it is crucial to recognize the synergy between the UN Ocean Decade and the core principles of Global Development Initiative. Both frameworks are rooted in inclusivity, innovation and action-oriented strategies to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nFor the Maldives, the GDI provides a unique opportunity to advocate for equitable ocean research policies that empower our fishing communities and protect our biodiversity. The principles of the GDI-with its focus on innovation, inclusivity and results-oriented actions \u2014 offer a complementary framework for achieving the goals of the Ocean Decade.\n\nAs the GDI champions global partnerships, mobilizes resources and bridges the North-South divide, it provides the support necessary to implement key \"decade programs\" in areas such as early-warning systems, advancing ocean literacy and promoting innovations in sustainable fisheries and aquaculture. Together, these frameworks represent a road map to navigate the most urgent challenges rooted in our ocean. The Maldives is committed to being an active partner in this journey, leveraging our unique insights as a small island nation to contribute to global solutions.\n\nAhmed Shiyam, minister of fisheries and ocean resources of Maldives\n\nBRI facilitates ocean governance\n\nThe Indian Ocean is a region of immense significance. Pakistan is a maritime nation with nearly 1,050 kilometers of coastline along the Arabian Sea. Our national maritime policy prioritizes the sustainable utilization of marine resources, aligning economic development with environmental preservation.\n\nThe oceans hold unparalleled potential to drive economic growth, alleviate poverty and ensure environmental sustainability. By integrating ocean sustainability into the Global Development Initiative framework, we can ensure a more comprehensive and interconnected approach to global development.\n\nThrough our collaboration with China under the Belt and Road Initiative framework, Pakistan has advanced innovative approaches to sustainable ocean governance. Let us continue to work together, leveraging technology, fostering knowledge-sharing and deepening partnerships to ensure that our oceans remain a source of life and prosperity for generations to come. Pakistan stands firmly committed to this shared vision and looks forward to advancing cooperation with China and all our partners here today for a better, just, inclusive and sustainable global development.\n\nAhsan Iqbal, federal minister of planning, development and special initiatives of Pakistan\n\nThe views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.\n\nIf you have a specific expertise, or would like to share your thought about our stories, then send us your writings at opinion@chinadaily.com.cn, and comment@chinadaily.com.cn."

Kubernetes ensures seamless scalability by orchestrating containerized applications across varied environments, while Docker enhances flexibility with consistent application performance across platforms. By automating deployment, scaling, and maintenance, these tools free developers to focus on innovation, enabling faster and more reliable application delivery. Together, they are becoming indispensable for modern cloud strategies.\n\nHybrid-Multi-Cloud Architectures: Flexibility Meets Efficiency\n\nHybrid and multi-cloud strategies are poised to dominate as businesses aim to optimize their cloud environments. These approaches offer operational flexibility by enabling workloads across on-premises, private, and public clouds, ensuring businesses leverage the best of each. By reducing dependency on a single vendor, multi-cloud setups enhance resilience and continuity while allowing cost-efficient workload allocation without compromising performance. This shift highlights the growing demand for control and customization in cloud solutions.\n\nData Security in Cloud Computing\n\nAs cyber threats continue to escalate, securing cloud environments has become a top priority. Zero-trust architecture enforces stringent identity verification at every level, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. AI-driven threat detection leverages machine learning to identify and neutralize potential breaches in real time, while advanced encryption techniques safeguard data both in transit and at rest. By adopting these robust security measures, businesses can protect critical assets and maintain compliance with evolving regulations.\n\nSustainability in the Cloud\n\nCloud providers are placing sustainability at the forefront, driving eco-friendly initiatives that redefine the industry. Energy-efficient data centers powered by renewables and AI-driven cooling systems are minimizing carbon footprints. Circular hardware models emphasize recycling components, reducing waste, and promoting resource efficiency. With major players committing to carbon-neutral goals, sustainability has evolved from a corporate responsibility to a competitive advantage, aligning businesses with environmentally conscious values in 2025.\n\nPreparing for 2025\n\nThe future of cloud computing is not just about technology but the strategic advantages it brings to businesses. By leveraging emerging trends like Kubernetes, edge computing, and hybrid-cloud strategies, organizations can achieve unparalleled scalability, security, and sustainability."

Ebb Cade, an injured worker, was injected with plutonium to study its effects. These experiments remained hidden until 1994, when the Department of Energy revealed details about them\n\nIn 1994, it was revealed that they were part of Project Mogul, a spy program against the Soviet Union\n\nMKUltra (1953-1973): this secret CIA program sought to control the mind through drugs such as LSD. Experiments were conducted on civilians and agents without their consent, resulting in deaths and serious psychological damage. Although the program was exposed in 1974, many files were destroyed before they were revealed\n\nCOINTELPRO (1956-1971): The FBI spied on and sabotaged activists and political leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr. and the Black Panthers. The program came to light in 1971 after a document theft from an FBI office."

            "article_content": "Prologue\n\nQuite by accident, a neighbor said to me that the New York Times had a lengthy opinion piece in support of animal farms, which represent the worst form of modern agriculture. I checked it out and the neighbor was right. The New York Times had more than one opinion piece parroting the anxieties of agricultural scientists and advertisements and misleading rhetoric of agribusiness. The editor of the effort, Eliza Barclay, is confident that the future of our food may rest \u201cin vast, sustainably managed factory farms [relying on] water\u2026 pumped across the country, from the Great Lakes to California.\u201d\n\nDante\u2019s inferno\n\nThis science fiction fantasy shocked me. I have been reading the New York Times, on and off, for many years. Its reporters write well and, in some instances, cover controversial and conventional politics and international affairs, though in the case of the wars in Ukraine and Israel, the Times follows strictly the script of the State Department.\n\nBut reading eloquent articles in support of the so-called \u201cgreen revolution,\u201d pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, giant automated harvester machines and \u201ctaking care\u201d of millions of cattle in order to add some more pounds of meat on their bodies on the eve of their slaughter, was too much. David Wallace-Wells, one of the opinion writers for the New York Times, started the discussion with an extensive article exploring the vulnerabilities of agriculture at a time climate chaos is changing everything, including conventional farming. He says that the alternative farming ways like no-till (climate-friendly regenerative practices) is losing its appeal. And vegetarianism is apparently a fad among the rich, while meat-eating has been expanding in a dramatic and unconscionable rate in both America and Europe.\n\nCertainly, these are troubling trends as meat eating is responsible for the largest amounts of greenhouse gases coming out of agriculture. About half of the land on the planet is for growing food. And three-quarters of that land produces feed for livestock.\n\nSome of the concerns raised by Wallace-Wells are legitimate, though he repeated agribusiness myths like that of the miraculous impact of the green revolution in Asia. In posing the problems of a farming \u201csystem\u201d embraced by climate chaos and abuse / overuse of drinking water worldwide, he said nothing of what could reduce the looming dangers of fossil-fuel agriculture caught in the tectonic plates of billionaire control and addiction to hazardous pesticides and gigantic machines. Meat eating must be dramatically reduced as much as population must decline \u2014 dramatically. No woman should have more than one child.\n\nWorld leaders and scientists must finally become adults in the room. Stop wars. They are climate fuses. Phaseout at lease 50 percent of fossil fuels by 2030. Split large estates to small organic farms, which use neither pesticides, nor synthetic or sludge fertilizers, radiation, and genetic engineering. Join ancient knowledge of growing food with the latest insights from the science of agroecology. We cannot keep saying we must double food production because we expect an additional billion or two of humans \u2013 by 2050.\n\nThe dismal picture Wallace-Wells painted becomes the background for the ideas and arguments in support of a thoroughly discredited, corrupt and violent slaughterhouse / animal farm for the climate-ridden agriculture of skyscrapers of the future. Expanding animal farms horizontally or vertically is wrong and immoral. These animal factories separate farmers and non-farmers from nature. They justify the manipulation and the dumping of the sacred Earth and her sacred animals in their shredding machine. It\u2019s as if we cannot learn from our past errors. We keep disregarding millennial agrarian traditions and civilizations, much less science, ecology and a livable future. Xenophon, student of Socrates and general and historian, mirrored Homer in arguing that small-scale farming made the Greeks food secure and champions of freedom, democracy, science, craftsmanship, piety for the gods, and civilization.\n\nWhich is better, the small or the large farm?\n\nWe cannot ignore Xenophon. Small farms are civilization. Vast factory farms are alien to civilization. They are large factories of disease, mechanized inhumanity and gargantuan violence. Vast industrial farms do not produce more food per acre than tiny family farms. They give birth instead to local and global hunger.\n\nMiguel Altieri, Professor Emeritus of agroecology at the University of California, Berkeley, is very concerned about the dominance of industrial agriculture. \u201cThis crisis,\u201d he says, \u201cthreatens the livelihoods of over a billion hungry people, [it] is the direct result of the dominating industrial farming model, which is dangerously dependent on fossil fuels and has also become the largest source of human impact on the biosphere. Ninety-one per cent of the 1.5 billion hectares of cropland are under annual crops worldwide, mostly monocultures of wheat, rice, maize, cotton, and soybeans highly dependent on inputs of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and huge amounts of irrigation water, and which increasingly advance at the expense of forests and other natural vegetation. In this [twenty-first] century, one of the main ecological dilemmas arising from the environmental homogenization of agricultural systems is an increased vulnerability of crops to climate change. Subsidized grain monocultures convey temporary economic advantages to a few large-scale farmers, but in the long term they do not represent an ecological optimum. Rather, the drastic narrowing of cultivated plant diversity has put the world\u2019s food production in greater peril. The social and environmental impacts of local crop shortfalls resulting from such uniformity can be considerable in an era of climatic extremes as crop losses often mean ongoing ecological degradation, poverty, hunger and even famine.\u201d\n\nAltieri also argues that small family farms are more productive than large industrial farms. \u201cIn overall output, the diversified [small] farm,\u201d he says, \u201cproduces much more food, even if measured in dollars. In the USA data shows that the smallest 2-hectare farms produced $15,104 per hectare and netted about $2,902 per acre. The largest farms, averaging 15,581 hectares, yielded $249 per hectare and netted about $52 per hectare. Not only do small-medium-sized farms exhibit higher yields than conventional farmers but do so with much lower negative impact on the environment. Small farms are \u2018multi-functional\u2019\u2013 more productive, more efficient, and contribute more to economic development than do large farms. Communities surrounded by populous small farms have healthier economies than do communities surrounded by depopulated large, mechanized farms. One recent study on the impact of small farms on local economies found that small producers create 10% more permanent jobs, a 20% larger increase in retail sales, and a 37% larger increase in local per capita income. Small farmers also take better care of natural resources, including reducing soil erosion and conserving biodiversity.\u201d\n\nIn addition, small organic family farms cool the climate. They have been sequestering greenhouse gases into the soil.\n\nI have also documented these advantages of small farms in my works. I learned from my long experience at the US Environmental Protection Agency. Small is beautiful. Small farms in a village or near towns grow wholesome food, which becomes human and environmental health, supporting honeybees and biodiversity, wildlife, democracy and a cooler planet.\n\nIn contrast, large farms, and especially vast animal factories, produce unhealthy food contaminated for the most part by neurotoxic and carcinogenic pesticides and antibiotics. The medical and ecological costs of this food are high, harming both humans and nature. Chemicals and machines threaten the integrity of the natural world and the philosophical and political health of democratic societies. What is a growing boy and girl supposed to think of themselves and their parents seeing the elders building the infrastructure of factory death, which includes billions of animals and the periodic spread of deadly pandemics?\n\nWeaponized farming\n\nSo, the New York Times has weaponized agriculture for probably similar reasons it favors America\u2019s funding of the horrendous war in Ukraine and Israel\u2019s wars against Palestine-Lebanon-Syria. Israel is having America fight its wars \u2014 in order to fulfill a fictional delusion, recreating Israel on the basis of the sayings of a seventh century BCE Biblical author. Yet astonishingly, this doesn\u2019t bother the Times or the Biden administration.\n\nThe planetary emperor\n\nJeffrey Sachs of Columbia University explains America\u2019s obsession with war like a symptom of megalomania and delusion of global hegemony. He is right. I have reached a similar conclusion. Greek history is very instructive about things political and philosophical. What the Athenian rural oligarchs did in the sixth century BCE \u2013 selling into slavery Athenian peasants who could not repay their debt, still speaks to us. But, fortunately, the rest of the Athenian powerful invited Solon to solve the crisis. Solon was a former ruler and a patriot. He knew the billionaires of his age. He made slavery illegal and set the foundations of democracy. But in addition to the insights that inspire me from Greek history, I have been observing America for several decades. Regrettably, America follows closely the career of imperial Rome and England, especially in agriculture. Four of my books document the rise of the large farms and their ecological and political deleterious effects in America and the world.\n\nSachs has spent his life watching carefully US finance policy makers and especially the dramatic domestic and global impact of the Military-Industrial Complex, the trillions of dollars the US has been spending for having or thinking and willing to believe in a total strategic dominance over the planet by encircling the Earth with more than 750 military bases. However, the costs of this imaginary planetary control are very high. The US government and the billionaires behind the throne and the \u201clawmakers\u201d in Washington, DC, have done very little to stop, much less correct, the degradation of the country\u2019s infrastructure. I rode a bullet train, not in America, but in China. There are no protections for those who avoid driving a car. I ride my bike and twice cars almost killed me. American oligarchs have also failed miserably to stop and reverse the growing inequality between the few and the many. Senator Bernie Sanders speaks of the billionaire class. Sachs said that 10 Americans have over a trillion dollars.\n\nIt\u2019s this reality, hubris of global hegemony and its unfathomable costs, that threaten America. The construction of a sandcastle of planetary control as well as the real control and management of the US economy by a handful of billionaires explains the tilt of the New York Times in embracing vast animal farms as the new mode of agriculture. Mega factory farms, however, have never strived to feed the world. The \u201cgreen revolution\u201d was no more than a campaign to grab land from small farmers and sell pesticides and fertilizers and agricultural machines. It did not feed people who did not have the money to buy food. In fact, the number of hungry people is increasing in the world. In 2023, about 757 million people were hungry.\n\nThe billionaire owners of large factory farms, exactly like the dark age feudal landlords of England and France, use slaughterhouses to control the food people eat. They also buy most of the best land. They hide these political goals. And media and newspapers like the New York Times help them cover up those secrets.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.
