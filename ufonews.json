        "article_content": "iPhone users in some markets discovered a standalone Google Gemini app for iPhone a few days ago. The app wasn\u2019t available in most markets, as Google was apparently testing it ahead of a more widespread release. Fast-forward to Thursday, Google is ready to make the standalone Gemini app available to iPhone users around the world. The Gemini went up in the App Store quietly, and you can download it right now.\n\nThe Google Gemini app is now available as a separate app from the main Google app, where you might have accessed the Gemini AI on the iPhone in the past. The best part about the Gemini app is that it comes with support for Gemini Live, Google\u2019s version of ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode.\n\nIt\u2019s a conversational AI that lets you talk to the chatbot just like you\u2019re speaking to a human. You can interrupt the AI and change prompts on the fly, similar to how a conversation between two people would flow.\n\nGemini Live isn\u2019t available in the main Google app on the iPhone, so Google\u2019s new standalone Gemini app is the only way to get it on your iPhone.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nGoogle Live will support personalization, as you can choose from various voices and languages.\n\nGoogle Gemini app for iPhone is available in the App Store. Image source: Google via App Store\n\nYou can use Gemini Live to talk about anything, just as you would with ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode. Here\u2019s what the Gemini app description says Gemini can do for you on the iPhone:\n\nGo Live with Gemini to brainstorm ideas, simplify complex topics, and rehearse for important moments. Just click on the Gemini Live button in your Gemini app \u2013 Connect with your favorite Google apps like Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and more \u2013 Study smarter and explore any topic with interactive visuals and real-world examples \u2013 Unlock a world of expertise and get tailored information about any topic \u2013 Plan trips better and faster \u2013 Create AI-generated images in seconds \u2013 Get summaries, deep dives, and source links, all in one place \u2013 Brainstorm new ideas, or improve existing ones\n\nFor example, Gemini Live can be a study companion, ready to assist you while you learn.\n\nThe Gemini app for iPhone also supports image generation, just like ChatGPT does.\n\nMore interesting to me is the Gemini\u2019s app integration with other Google apps and services you might be using on iPhone. The description says the Gemini app will connect with your favorite Google apps once you install it.\n\nGemini can connect to YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, Calendar, and other apps straight from your chat. That\u2019s certainly a useful feature if you use Google apps on your iPhone and want to include Gemini in that. This sort of interaction goes beyond what ChatGPT can do, and it\u2019s all the more interesting as Google doesn\u2019t have any say in how iOS works.\n\nGoogle Gemini app for iPhone: Features and screenshots. Image source: Google via App Store\n\nAlso, Gemini isn\u2019t part of Apple Intelligence like ChatGPT will be. Even then, ChatGPT will not be able to connect to any other apps. Siri will handle such capabilities later down the road.\n\nGoogle Gemini is available as a free download from the App Store. If you want access to Google\u2019s latest Gemini models, you\u2019ll need a Gemini Advanced subscription priced at $19.99. You can test Gemini Advanced for free for a month before you decide to keep it."

A key feature is Gemini Live, which wasn't available in the previous Google app implementation. When engaged in a conversation, Gemini Live appears in both the Dynamic Island and Lock Screen, letting you control your AI interactions without returning to the main app.\n\nThe app is free to download, and Google offers premium features through Gemini Advanced subscriptions available as in-app purchases. Gemini Advanced is part of a Google One AI premium plan costing $18.99 per month. Apart from Gemini in Mail, Docs, and more, it includes access to Google's next-generation model, 1.5 Pro, priority access to new features, and a one million token context window. Users need to sign in with a Google account to access the service.\n\n\n\nThe rollout follows an initial soft launch in the Philippines earlier this week, with availability now extending to additional regions including Australia, India, the US, and the UK.\n\nPreviously, iOS users could only access Gemini through a dedicated tab within the main Google app, which offered a more limited experience compared to the Android version. This standalone release, available on the App Store, brings feature parity closer between the two mobile platforms."

We even saw concepts of undetectable malware created with the help of chatbots despite the protections that are typically built into these programs.\n\nMore recently, we heard about an attempted Gmail account takeover that utilized a voice call with what seemed to be a Google support person. The tech-savvy engineer who was targeted ended up spotting the scam and concluded that he was talking with an AI chatbot rather than a real human. While that hack attempt failed, attackers might still try to employ various AI tactics to get into your accounts.\n\nToday's Top Deals\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut AI like Google\u2019s Gemini can be used to protect people by looking out for patterns in calls and app behavior that users would not otherwise catch. That\u2019s exactly what Google is doing with AI on Pixel phones, which are about to get a couple of handy new AI-powered security features: Scam Detection for voice calls, live threat detection, and real-time alerts in Google Play Protect for apps.\n\nPixel phones as old as the Pixel 6 series will get the new AI security features first. Google will then eventually bring at least some of them to other Android handsets.\n\nGoogle detailed the new AI security features in a blog post on Wednesday.\n\nGoogle's new Scam Detection AI security feature.\n\nScam Detection will let you use Gemini Nano, Google\u2019s on-device AI, to listen to calls in real time. The AI will detect conversation patterns that are associated with scams and inform you as they happen:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf a caller claims to be from your bank and asks you to urgently transfer funds due to an alleged account breach, Scam Detection will process the call to determine whether the call is likely spam and, if so, can provide an audio and haptic alert and visual warning that the call may be a scam.\n\nThe feature will be turned off by default, but you can enable Scam Detection and disable it whenever you feel like it. Google says the security feature is built with privacy at the core. The calls are processed on the device via Gemini Nano, and the AI will not transmit any data to Google\u2019s servers:\n\nThe AI detection model and processing are fully on-device, which means that no conversation audio or transcription is stored on the device, sent to Google servers or anywhere else, or retrievable after the call.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the kind of privacy guarantee such security products need.\n\nScam Detection will start rolling out to Phone by Google public beta users in the US first. You\u2019ll need a Pixel 6 or later to use the feature, and English is the only supported language for now. Google is also encouraging users to submit feedback if they plan to use the feature while in beta.\n\nGoogle Play Protect will issue notifications in real-time about malicious apps.\n\nCalls are only a part of the problem. You can end up with malware apps on your phone, especially on Android, where it\u2019s easier to sideload apps than on iPhone. Sometimes, even apps in the Play Store turn out to contain malware despite Google\u2019s best efforts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGoogle\u2019s Wednesday announcement also covers new AI security features related to app installs. Google Play Protect already works in the background on the phone to protect against malware and unsafe apps in real time.\n\nThanks to the new features, live threat detection, and real-time alerts, Google Play Protect will now notify you in real-time that an unsafe app might be showing potentially harmful behavior.\n\nLike Scam Detection, the app-related AI security features will not collect user data while they monitor the Pixel phone:\n\nAt launch, live threat detection will focus on stalkerware, code that may collect personal or sensitive data for monitoring purposes without user consent, and we will explore expanding its detection to other types of harmful apps in the future. All of this protection happens on your device in a privacy preserving way through Private Compute Core, which allows us to protect users without collecting data.\n\nThe new Google Play Protect features are available on Pixel 6 phones and newer right now, and they\u2019ll expand to other Android phones in the coming months.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDon't Miss: Today\u2019s deals: $17.50 Apple AirTags, $50 off Madden NFL 25, $30 Crock-Pot Electric Lunch Box, more\n\nMore Top Deals\n\nSign up for BGR's Newsletter.

        "article_content": "Summary: Traditional paranormal beliefs, such as witchcraft and religious superstition, are linked to higher stress and reduced coping ability, while new age beliefs, like spiritualism and precognition, show no such link. Researchers used an improved scale to analyze responses from over 3,000 participants, revealing that traditional beliefs may reflect anxieties about external control.\n\nThe findings highlight the psychological differences between belief types but cannot confirm cause-and-effect relationships. Future research could explore how paranormal beliefs shape behaviors, such as attitudes toward alternative medicine and conspiracy theories.\n\nKey Facts:\n\nTraditional paranormal beliefs were associated with greater stress and reduced coping ability.\n\nNew age beliefs were not linked to stress or coping tendencies.\n\nThe study highlights the psychological impacts of external control perceptions in traditional beliefs.\n\nSource: PLOS\n\nIn a new study, feelings of distress and reduced ability to cope with stress were associated with traditional paranormal beliefs, but not with new age philosophy. Kenneth Drinkwater Ph.D. of Manchester Metropolitan University, U.K., and colleagues present these findings in the open-access journal PLOS ONE on November 13, 2024.\n\nPrior research has suggested that paranormal belief, in general, is not linked to poorer psychological wellbeing, but that certain facets of paranormal belief, such as superstition, may be linked with stress vulnerability.\n\nHowever, much of this research relies on a questionnaire known as the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, which has statistical issues that limit its usefulness.\n\nA different version, known as the Rasch purified Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, aims to improve on the earlier scale. To help deepen understanding of potential links between paranormal belief and stress, Drinkwater and colleagues had 3,084 people complete this scale alongside a questionnaire evaluating different facets of perceived stress.\n\nA key feature of the Rasch purified Revised Paranormal Belief Scale is that it differentiates between two dimensions of belief: first, traditional paranormal belief, which deals with cultural concepts of traditional religious belief and witchcraft, and second, new age philosophy, dealing with individual paranormal abilities known as psi, spiritualism, and precognition.\n\nAnalysis of the study participants\u2019 responses revealed that people who scored higher for traditional paranormal belief tended to show elevated distress and reduced feelings of being able to cope with stress.\n\nHowever, belief in new age philosophy was not statistically linked to any tendencies regarding distress or coping.\n\nThese findings are in line with the idea that traditional paranormal belief reflects anxiety about a lack of control over external forces that influence one\u2019s existence. However, the authors note that this study was exploratory and does not support any cause-effect relationship.\n\nMore research will be needed to clarify the relationship between paranormal belief and stress. The authors suggest that such research is important because paranormal belief can influence people\u2019s everyday behavior and attitudes, such as those regarding alternative medicine, antivaccination, and conspiracies.\n\nThe authors add: \u201cFindings support the notion that traditional paranormal belief is associated with external control, specifically the notion that unknown supernatural forces/powers influence existence.\n\n\u201cHowever, additional research is still needed if we are to further explore these fascinating relationships in connection to perceived stress, wellbeing and coping styles.\u201d\n\nAbout this neurotheology and stress research news\n\nAuthor: Hanna Abdallah\n\nSource: PLOS\n\nContact: Hanna Abdallah \u2013 PLOS\n\nImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n\n\u201cRe-evaluation of the relationship between paranormal belief and perceived stress using statistical modelling\u201d by Kenneth Drinkwater et al. PLOS ONE\n\nAbstract\n\nRe-evaluation of the relationship between paranormal belief and perceived stress using statistical modelling\n\nRecent research indicates that paranormal belief, in the absence of allied cognitive-perceptual and psychopathology-related factors, is not associated with negative wellbeing outcomes. However, investigators have historically reported relationships between specific facets of belief (e.g., superstition) and stress vulnerability.\n\nThese typically derive from the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS), which has questionable psychometric integrity. The main issue being that several RPBS items perform poorly.\n\nNoting this, the present paper re-examined the relationship between paranormal belief and stress using the Rasch purified version of the RPBS. This comprises two dimensions, called Traditional Paranormal Belief (TPB) and New Age Philosophy (NAP). These are operationalised in terms of function. Specifically, whether belief provides a sense of control at the social (TPB) or individual level (NAP).\n\nAccordingly, this study examined whether TPB and NAP were differentially predictive of levels of perceived stress. In this context, stress served as an indicator of well-being. A sample of 3084 participants (Mage = 50.31, SD = 15.20, range 18\u201391) completed the RPBS alongside the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10).\n\nConfirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling revealed that TPB was significantly predictive of higher Distress, and lower Coping. NAP was neither predictive of Distress nor Coping.\n\nThese findings support the notion that TPB is attendant with external control, particularly the notion that unknown supernatural forces/powers influence existence."

This extraordinary find, made during an October 2024 expedition by National Geographic's Pristine Seas team, reveals a massive coral structure visible even from space. Larger than a blue whale and estimated to be centuries old, this colossal colony has remained hidden until now, offering a rare glimpse into the resilience of marine life. As climate change threatens coral reefs worldwide, this discovery highlights both the beauty and fragility of these essential underwater ecosystems.This discovery not only sheds light on the size and resilience of the largest coral colony on Earth but also raises important questions about the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems and the need for conservation efforts to protect these vital organisms. The discovery of this immense coral colony emphasises the fragility and beauty of our planet\u2019s underwater worlds and the importance of safeguarding them for future generations.The massive coral colony measures 112 feet by 105 feet and sits at a depth of 42 feet underwater. It rises about 16 feet from the ocean floor and is estimated to be around 300 years old, though it could be much older. This discovery occurred just a day before the team was set to move to a new area for their research. A videographer who was documenting the impacts of climate change on the Pacific Ocean stumbled upon the coral while working, leading to the unexpected find.The coral is made up of nearly a billion tiny individual creatures that work together as a single organism. According to Molly Timmers, the expedition\u2019s lead scientist, the colony is a type of hard coral called Pavona clavus\u2014commonly known as shoulder blade coral. The coral's distinctive features include columns that resemble shoulders, and its colour palette includes various shades of brown, yellow, red, pink, and blue.One of the photographers on the expedition, Manu San Felix, described the coral as being like an \"underwater cathedral.\" He expressed a deep sense of awe and reverence for the coral, noting its long existence in one place, enduring for centuries despite the challenges of climate change and oceanic changes. The coral's longevity evokes a sense of connection to the distant past, as Timmers explained, saying that the discovery felt like seeing ancestors still present in the water.Corals, which are animals closely related to jellyfish and sea anemones, form colonies by clustering thousands of individual polyps. These colonies make up coral reefs, which are vital ecosystems for marine life. Sadly, corals are increasingly threatened by warming ocean temperatures and the effects of climate change. However, the coral colony in question seems to have avoided some of the worst impacts, likely because it resides in deeper waters, which provide some protection from the higher temperatures found closer to the surface.Interestingly, the researchers suggest that the local people in the area may have mistaken the large coral colony for a massive rock due to its size and appearance. This is an intriguing reminder of how even the most extraordinary natural phenomena can go unnoticed by those living in close proximity. It also highlights the often-hidden richness of the natural world and how much there is still to discover, even in well-explored areas.This discovery is not only significant in terms of its size and age but also in the broader context of coral conservation and the impact of climate change on ocean ecosystems. Seeing such a resilient and ancient organism in its natural habitat has a powerful emotional effect on those who encounter it. For Timmers, it is a reminder of the continuity of life over time, underscoring the importance of preserving these vital ecosystems for future generations."

        "article_content": "Researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) have unveiled a new species of sea slug, Bathydevius caudactylus, that is the first known nudibranch to inhabit the open water column of the deep sea. After reviewing more than 150 sightings from MBARI's remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) over the past 20 years, the team published a detailed description of this mysterious mollusk in the journal Deep-Sea Research.\n\nFirst observed in February 2000 during a dive with an ROV offshore of Monterey Bay at a depth of 2,614 meters (8,576 feet), Bathydevius caudactylus puzzled scientists with its unique features and behaviors. Unlike typical nudibranchs, which usually crawl along the seafloor in coastal environments such as coral reefs, kelp forests, and tide pools, this sea slug swims freely through the ocean's midnight zone\u2014a wide area of open water about 1,000 to 4,000 meters (3,300 to 13,100 feet) below the surface.\n\n\"Thanks to MBARI's advanced underwater technology, we were able to prepare the most complete description of a deep-sea animal ever made. We have invested more than 20 years in understanding the natural history of this fascinating species of nudibranch. Our discovery is a new piece of the puzzle that may help better understand the Earth's largest habitat,\" said Bruce Robison, MBARI's lead scientist, according to RPP Noticias.\n\nBathydevius caudactylus stands out with a large, gelatinous hood that it uses to capture prey, fingerlike projections at one end, and colorful internal organs in between. The sea slug exhibits bright bioluminescence, glowing a bioluminescent blue when threatened to distract hungry predators. On one occasion, researchers observed it illuminating and then shedding a finger-like projection that glowed continuously from the tail, likely serving as a decoy to distract a potential predator.\n\n\"When we first filmed it glowing with the ROV, everyone in the control room let out a loud 'Oooooh!' at the same time. We were all enchanted by the sight,\" said Steven Haddock, a senior scientist at MBARI, as reported by Popular Science. Haddock added, \"Only recently have cameras become capable of filming bioluminescence in high-resolution and in full color.\"\n\nThe discovery of Bathydevius caudactylus is significant not only because it is the first known sea slug to inhabit the deep-water column but also because its unique characteristics warrant the creation of a new family, Bathydeviidae. Genetic analysis revealed that it is so distinct from other known nudibranchs that it does not fit within existing classifications. \"The genetic story showed that they were not close relatives, indicating that we had yet another example of convergence,\" Haddock stated, according to IFLScience.\n\nThe sea slug's ability to swim freely in the midwaters is a departure from the norm for nudibranchs. Bathydevius caudactylus flexes its body up and down to swim or drifts motionless with the currents. Its transparent body helps it avoid detection by predators, allowing it to hide in plain sight. \"Virtually everything about Bathydevius seems remarkable to me,\" Robison said, as quoted by IFLScience. \"The most striking initial impact comes from its unusual anatomy and configuration, which is very unlike all other nudibranchs.\"\n\nResearchers also observed that Bathydevius caudactylus uses a cavernous hood to trap crustaceans, working somewhat like a Venus flytrap. It can expel water rapidly from its hood, producing jet-like bursts that send it moving quickly backward to escape predators. Additionally, the nudibranch is hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female reproductive organs. The scientists report that it appears to descend to the seafloor to spawn, occasionally finding spawning individuals in proximity to one another on the seabed.\n\n\"MBARI is one of the only places in the world where we have taken this new technology into the deep ocean, allowing us to study the luminous behavior of deep-sea animals in their natural habitat,\" Haddock noted, as per Popular Science. He added, \"For there to be a relatively large, unique, and glowing animal that is in a previously unknown family really underscores the importance of using new technology to catalog this vast environment.\"\n\nThe ocean's vast midwaters are the largest and least explored part of the planet's biosphere, presenting long-standing challenges for exploration due to their depth. Bathydevius caudactylus has evolved unique adaptations to survive in the harsh conditions of the deep sea, including its elastic hood and paddle-shaped tail. Its bioluminescence adds to its extraordinary adaptations to life in the deep sea, where it resides in dark waters. Stay updated with the latest news!

By exploring and documenting creatures like Bathydevius caudactylus, scientists aim to gain a better understanding of the adaptations and behaviors that enable life in the extreme conditions of the deep sea.\n\nCurrently, Bathydevius caudactylus is known to live in the coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean off North America. MBARI scientists have spotted it as far north as Oregon and as far south as Southern California. An observation of a similar-looking animal by NOAA researchers in the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific suggests that it may have a wider distribution.\n\nThe research team hopes that studying this species will shed light on the mysteries of the midnight zone. \"What is exciting to me about the mystery mollusc is that it exemplifies how much we are learning as we spend more time in the deep sea, particularly below 2,000 meters,\" Haddock said, according to Popular Science.\n\nThis discovery emphasizes the importance of continuing to explore the ocean's depths to uncover the secrets of Earth's largest and least understood habitat. As Robison noted, Bathydevius caudactylus adds valuable insights to our understanding of the planet's largest biosphere, helping science understand not only unfamiliar aspects of this vast habitat but also the natural history of some of its fascinating residents.\n\nSources: IFLScience, The Sun, The Scottish Sun, RPP Noticias, Interesting Engineering, Popular Science, The Daily Star Lebanon, The New York Times\n\nThis article was written in collaboration with generative AI company Alchemiq"

        "article_content": "No-code platforms are not dead yet. They are very much alive with the help of AI. Bengaluru-based Tablesprint aims to stand out as an AI-powered low-code platform, designed to bring enterprise-level applications to companies of all sizes.\n\nFollowing the recent $1 million seed funding round led by Ola\u2019s co-founder Ankit Bhati and other notable investors, Tablesprint co-founder and CEO Abhijeet Kumar discussed with AIM the company\u2019s vision, its distinct position in the market, and its potential to transform business operations globally, competing with the likes of Salesforce.\n\nKumar\u2019s background includes founding and scaling a successful startup that eventually became BigBasket\u2019s backbone. His experience in handling operations-heavy systems provided the foundation for Tablesprint\u2019s solutions. \u201cBigBasket is an enormous operation, especially from an operational and logistics perspective,\u201d Kumar noted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a consumer tech business that relies heavily on robust technology. That experience equipped us with the knowledge to tackle complex tech challenges, which now fuels Tablesprint\u2019s mission.\u201d\n\nAnother Low-code/No-code?\n\nWhile many platforms provide low-code options, Tablesprint aims to address a crucial gap in enterprise technology: accessibility and control over data. Traditional low-code platforms often offer limited control over sensitive information due to rigid structures and limited permissions.\n\nTablesprint\u2019s platform addresses this by incorporating robust data controls, permissions, and a secure backend infrastructure that integrates seamlessly with AI, ensuring that businesses can safely and effectively leverage their data. Rather than attempting to build AI models from scratch, Tablesprint focuses on integrating and optimising existing open-source and commercial models to provide a comprehensive, end-to-end solution that enterprises can trust.\n\nThe moat of Tablesprint? Unique blend of affordability and flexibility, positioning it as an alternative to established players like Salesforce and Zoho. \u201cWe\u2019re offering the flexibility of Salesforce but at a Zoho price,\u201d Kumar explained. \u201cOur focus is on creating a customisable, scalable system that can handle complex enterprise needs without the high costs usually associated with such solutions.\u201d\n\nTablesprint\u2019s competitive advantage, Kumar emphasised, lies in its capacity to offer a Salesforce-like experience at a fraction of the cost, with a user interface (UI) that simplifies complex tasks. \u201cWith us, you\u2019re not just getting a software tool; you\u2019re gaining a system that adapts to your needs, allows for high-level customisations, and integrates AI capabilities directly into the workflow.\u201d\n\nChirag Jadhav, co-founder and CTO, earlier highlighted the platform\u2019s multi-tenant system designed for both developers and business users. \u201cCreating a system that resonates with both developers and business stakeholders is a significant challenge. We are excited with our progress so far and look forward to tackling more challenges ahead on this journey.\u201d\n\nFounded earlier this year, Tablesprint\u2019s AI-first SaaS platform allows companies to rapidly build customisable applications for various business functions, including HR, sales, operations, and vendor management, using open-source and closed-source models available in the market.\n\nIts no-code solution features modular building blocks such as AI write/image tools, workflows, and charts, enabling businesses to start with simple tasks like surveys and scale to full-fledged workflows.\n\nStaying Alive and Sprinting Ahead\n\nKumar is aware of the competition from established giants like Salesforce and Zoho, but he believes Tablesprint offers unique advantages that make it attractive, particularly for businesses conscious of both costs and customisation capabilities.\n\n\u201cTry making a form in Zoho, and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s not designed with seamless user experience in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cOur UI is optimised to make processes intuitive and efficient, making it appealing to users who need functionality without the overhead.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Kumar highlighted the often limited adoption rate of Salesforce due to its complexity and high price point, particularly in markets like India, where cost sensitivity is paramount. According to him, only around 34% of Salesforce licences end up being used because companies struggle with its complexity. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting that space by offering a similarly robust platform that\u2019s also simpler to use and much more affordable.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s go-to-market strategy involves partnering with implementation providers, giving entrepreneurs and developers the flexibility to use Tablesprint to build apps, which they can then offer to clients as solutions. \u201cTablesprint is not just an India-specific product; it\u2019s a global solution designed to help businesses worldwide streamline operations, build apps, and generate revenue by offering our platform as a customisable solution,\u201d Kumar explained.\n\nTablesprint\u2019s roadmap is ambitious. The company plans to expand its offerings by building a complete AI-based ERP system and form builder, with the goal of becoming a one-stop shop for enterprise applications across industries.\n\nDespite the increasing saturation in the low-code, no-code market, Kumar is confident that Tablesprint\u2019s model and global reach will help the company thrive in the long term.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still a startup, so bandwidth is sometimes an issue,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWe have so much interest that we have to pick and choose our clients carefully because we want to ensure each implementation is successful and adds value.\u201d\n\n(Total 2,490 views)"

A woman uses two joysticks to operate a pair of tabletop robotic arms that carefully lift and fold T-shirts into a neat pile. Several larger robots move pantry items from one cluttered box to another. In one corner of the room a man operates a plastic pincer that fits over his wrist and has a webcam on top. Robot parts litter the room.\n\nThe warehouse is home of Physical Intelligence, also known as PI or \u03c0 (hence the symbol on the front door), a startup that aims to give robots a profound artificial intelligence upgrade. Such is the excitement and expectation around the company\u2019s dream that investors are betting hundreds of millions that it will make the next earth-shaking breakthrough in the field of AI. Physical Intelligence last week announced it had raised $400 million from investors that include OpenAI and Jeff Bezos, at a valuation of over $2 billion.\n\nInside a glass-walled conference room on the second floor of the building, the startup's CEO, Karol Hausman, a tall man with a soft German accent and a few days of stubble, lays out the vision.\n\n\u201cIf I put you in control of a new robot, with a little bit of practice you'd probably be able to figure out how to control it,\u201d Hausman says. \u201cAnd if we really crack this problem, then AI will be able to do the same thing.\u201d\n\nPhysical Intelligence believes it can give robots humanlike understanding of the physical world and dexterity by feeding sensor and motion data from robots performing vast numbers of demonstrations into its master AI model. \u201cThis is, for us, what it will take to \u2018solve\u2019 physical intelligence,\u201d Hausman says. \u201cTo breathe intelligence into a robot just by connecting it to our model.\u201d\n\nDespite amazing AI advances in recent years, nobody has figured out how to make robots particularly clever or capable. The machines found in factories or warehouses are essentially high-tech automatons, going through precisely choreographed motions without a trace of wit or ingenuity.\n\nHausman is joined at the conference table by several other cofounders: Sergey Levine, a bespectacled young associate professor at UC Berkeley; Brian Ichter, a friendly, bearded fellow who previously worked with Hausman at Google; and Chelsea Finn, an assistant professor at Stanford University who joins via video link."
