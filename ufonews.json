(Youtube/The Age Of Disclosure)\n\nIn the trailer he said: \"The first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come. This is similar to The Manhattan Project; this is the atomic weapon on steroids.\"\n\nHe praised the documentary on social media, saying: \"The Age of Disclosure is the most revelatory, credible, and historic documentary ever made about UAP, non-human intelligent life, the Government\u2019s involvement, and the bi-partisan disclosure effort.\"\n\nIf that's true then this is pretty much what all those UFO hunters and true believers have been waiting for, someone saying they have been a first-hand witness to the evidence of non-human intelligent life.\n\nAdvert\n\nAmong the other contributors to the documentary are various high ranking US politicians including the director of national intelligence during Barack Obama's time in office.\n\nMeanwhile, senior CIA official Jim Semivan claimed that 'UAPs are here, they are real and they are not human'.\n\nFormer Department of Defense official Christopher Mellon called it the 'biggest discovery in human history' while his fellow former DoD member Luis Elizondo said there was 'information being locked away that can change the trajectory of [our] species'.\n\nIs this what we've all been waiting for?"

            "article_content": "\u201cI\u2019d no idea\u201d: The Pink Floyd song David Gilmour wasn\u2019t comfortable with\n\nWhen David Gilmour joined Pink Floyd in late 1967, he had a mountain to climb. Not only was he drafted in to help his friends circumvent the astounding collapse in the mental health of their leader, Syd Barrett, but within just a few months, he\u2019d be required to replace his old friend. Gilmour had played in bands before, but supplanting such a revered titan of the psychedelic trend was a different matter entirely.\n\nAfter a period of cutting their teeth at London\u2019s UFO Club, which saw Barrett and the group hone their incongruous psychedelic style, they released their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, in August 1967. Blending Barrett\u2019s take on pop with an improvisational spirit, rock and pioneering use of studio effects, it was profoundly psychedelic but also something else. The record was as if Barrett had opened a tiny door in the back of his mind, allowing the listener to sample his surreal LSD-coated otherworld within. It was like a planet from the hit sci-fi series Star Trek with the surreal features of Lewis Carroll\u2019s Wonderland.\n\nDespite such an acclaimed and influential record, Barrett\u2019s mental health would sadly plummet not long after its release, and by April of the following year, the band had ejected him. They simply could not go on with a frontman who was so erratic and inconsistent. They were left to finish their highly-anticipated second album, A Saucerful of Secrets, without him.\n\nNaturally, A Saucerful of Secrets has always been regarded as an oddity in Pink Floyd\u2019s back catalogue, featuring a young group with a new lineup trying to find a way forward after Barrett\u2019s departure. This saw bassist Roger Waters step up as the band\u2019s leader, and each member shared songwriting duties to alleviate the burden.\n\nBecause of this transitional nature, A Saucerful of Secrets has also long been deemed one of the band\u2019s worst efforts. However, it does contain great moments that point to where they would head now that Waters was in control and Gilmour was impressing himself on proceedings.\n\nOne of these is \u2018Corporal Clegg\u2019. Written by Waters, it tapped into the oddity of Barrett\u2019s work with Gilmour\u2019s noir-esque guitar line at the start, the over-pronounced English accent, and strange backing vocals. It\u2019s also significant as it saw Gilmour sing the majority of the lead vocals, and the serene moments of release, \u201cMrs Clegg, you must be proud of him\u2026\u201d, sonically evoke the later grandeur of their work on the likes of The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nDespite \u2018Corporal Clegg\u2019 being a crucial moment for Gilmour and Pink Floyd, speaking to Guitar Heroes in 1983, he explained how uncomfortable the song made him feel at the time. Responding to the suggestion that he was trying to sound like Jimi Hendrix on it, he soberingly conceded that he had no clue what he was doing at the time. He was still forming his now-iconic approach to the six-string\n\nRecalling how uncomfortable working on the song was, he said: \u201cNo, not really. I didn\u2019t know what the hell I was trying to play at the time to be quite honest. I\u2019d really no idea. What I was used to playing, the style I had, didn\u2019t fit Pink Floyd at the time, and I didn\u2019t really know quite what to do. Gradually, over the years, my style changed to fit Pink Floyd, and Pink Floyd changed to fit my style.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to characterise his style back then, the frank Gilmour replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think I had one really.\u201d"

Curai CEO\n\nChinese AI company DeepSeek has had some rather large success on the Apple App Store, with its AI assistant now the top free app on the App Store, beating out ChatGPT.\n\n2\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\nIn particular AI benchmarks, DeepSeek's R1 model matches or even beats OpenAI's new o1 model, and better yet... DeepSeek has said its R1 model cost just $5.6 million to train. This is compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars that other companies spend training their AI models.\n\nThis is all with US sanctions restricting high-powered AI chips from hitting Chinese shores, leaving DeepSeek to play it differently when it came to powering its AI training on the cheap. DeepSeek is using NVIDIA H100 AI GPUs for some of its training, with DeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng has recently said that US export restrictions are still bottlenecking the company.\n\nCurai CEO Neal Khosla has had some harsh comments, posting on X that \"deepseek is a CCP state psyop + economic warfare to make American AI unprofitable. they are faking the cost was low to justify setting price low and hoping everyone switches to it damage AI competitiveness in the US. Don't take the bait\".\n\nHowever, Khosla's father is an OpenAI investor thanks to X's awesome Community Notes feature.\n\nDeepSeek's new R1 model has 671 billion parameters is rather large, with smaller \"distilled\" versions of R1 models ranging from 1.5 billion parameters to 70 billion parameters. DeepSeek's smallest R1 model can run on a laptop, but for the full-force R1 model it requires much more hardware... but, it's available through DeepSeek's API at prices that are a game-changing 90-95% cheaper than OpenAI's o1 model."

            "article_content": "Scientists recently reported an unexpected deep-sea development in the Pacific: certain metallic rocks seem to be making oxygen in the dark, without light or sunshine, at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThis idea runs counter to the usual belief that oxygen only forms in sunlight through photosynthesis.\n\nAlthough these findings have stirred debate, the central claim is that potato-sized nodules found thousands of feet below the surface appear to split seawater molecules and release oxygen.\n\nOxygen and photosynthesis \u2013 the basics\n\nSince the late 1700s, we\u2019ve been taught that light creates oxygen through photosynthesis, a crucial natural process that keeps life on Earth thriving.\n\nPlants, algae, and some bacteria soak up sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, nature uses light as fuel to produce the oxygen we breathe and keep everything on Earth alive.\n\nPhotosynthesis not only gives energy to these organisms but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, maintaining the perfect balance of gases that most life forms need.\n\nUntil the discovery of dark oxygen, it has been commonly accepted knowledge that without light, photosynthesis would grind to a halt, and our planet wouldn\u2019t have the oxygen-rich air we rely on every day.\n\nDeep-sea rocks making oxygen\n\nExploration in a region called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone \u2013 where deep-sea mining companies are eyeing metals resources like cobalt and nickel \u2013 uncovered ferromanganese nodules resting on the ocean floor.\n\nFerromanganese nodules are like little treasure rocks that settle on the ocean floor, packed with metals such as manganese and iron.\n\nThese nodules form slowly over millions of years as minerals from seawater build up in layers around a tiny core, like a shark tooth or a piece of shell.\n\nThink of them as underwater onions, with each layer adding more minerals and creating these cool, rounded shapes.\n\nResearchers suggested that the nodules may produce electric charges that spark electrolysis, generating oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nHow do the rocks produce oxygen?\n\nEarly studies raised plenty of questions about the process and the potential effect on seafloor life.\n\nLeading the push for more answers is Andrew Sweetman, a professor at the Scottish Association for Marine Science.\n\nHe is running a three-year project to investigate how these nodules might form oxygen in the absence of light. One of his goals is to see if this phenomenon appears in other parts of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.\n\n\u201cOur discovery of dark oxygen was a paradigm shift in our understanding of the deep sea and potentially life on Earth, but it threw up more questions than answers,\u201d said Sweetman.\n\nHe and his team will also look into whether microbial reactions help release hydrogen, an energy source for certain deep-sea microbes.\n\nFreshwater mysteries\n\nDark oxygen has popped up in other surprising, light-deprived places.\n\nEmil Ruff detected oxygen in freshwater samples beneath Alberta, Canada. It appeared in groundwater that had been isolated for tens of thousands of years, yet still contained enough oxygen to support life.\n\n\u201cAfter 40,000 years or 30,000 years (separated from surface processes), there\u2019s no reason really to think that there should be any oxygen left,\u201d remarked Ruff.\n\nHe found that special bacteria could produce oxygen on their own by breaking down certain dissolved compounds.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ruff found that the quantity of oxygen produced was enough to sustain other oxygen-dependent microbial life in the groundwater.\n\nChallenging dark oxygen\n\nNot all scientists are in agreement about this dark oxygen discovery. Some deep-sea mining interests challenged Sweetman\u2019s work, saying they have found no such electrical oddities in the nodules.\n\nThe Metals Co. submitted a rebuttal of the scientific research paper to Nature Geoscience, which awaits peer review.\n\nMeanwhile, independent observers note the need for more experiments. A research oceanographer at the US Geological Survey\u2019s Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California, said the USGS has not observed any electrical phenomena in ferromanganese nodules examined so far.\n\nShe was not involved in either Sweetman\u2019s or Ruff\u2019s research.\n\nNASA hopes these findings might hint at life in places beyond Earth. Dark ocean worlds like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus are prime targets for research.\n\nSweetman shared that the space agency wants to test whether high pressures found on those icy moons can trigger oxygen generation in deep-sea rocks without direct sunlight. If the same basic chemistry works there, it could point to possible microbial life in alien seas.\n\nDark oxygen and deep-sea mining\n\nThe Clarion-Clipperton Zone sits far offshore, and mining there is governed by the International Seabed Authority. Critics argue that removing nodules in huge volumes could destroy habitats.\n\nOrganizations like Fauna & Flora warn of irreparable harm, saying it may disturb carbon storage in the ocean. Sweetman believes it is risky to harvest seabed minerals until scientists know a lot more about these systems.\n\nHe acknowledges the controversy and plans to address critics in peer-reviewed forums. For now, the hunt for hard data continues, fueled by the hope of expanding our understanding of life \u2013 both here and possibly on other worlds.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Geoscience.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

The Daily compiled a recap of their latest research developments.\n\nTracking a fast radio burst to an unlikely galaxy for the first time\n\nIn collaboration with colleagues at McGill University, NU researchers located and tracked a fast radio burst to an inactive galaxy two billion light-years away. The finding further complicates the mystery of these short-duration radio wave emissions by contrasting prevailing theories that FRBs originate in galaxies with active star formations, according to a news release.\n\nThe group of researchers first identified this specific FRB last February using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment radio telescope.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another mystery of the universe that I\u2019d like to explore,\u201d said Tarraneh Eftekhari, a NASA Hubble Einstein Fellow and researcher. \u201cIt was really, really surprising and also exciting to see.\u201d\n\nAs additional, smaller versions of CHIME \u2014 known as outrigger telescopes \u2014 come online, researchers believe they can localize the FRBs with finer precision, according to Eftekhari.\n\n\u201cIn the not too distant future, I think we\u2019ll revolutionize the field, so I\u2019m very excited for that,\u201d Eftekhari said.\n\nImproving the quality of perovskite solar cells\n\nNU researchers discovered a new method to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells, or solar cells with a crystal structure. The team, led by chemistry Prof. Ted Sargent, published its findings Jan. 9 in the academic journal Joule, according to a news release.\n\nPSCs offer a potential alternative to costly, silicon-based solar panels, chemistry Prof. Bin Chen said in an interview with The Daily.\n\n\u201cThere are many emerging technologies, and perovskites promise to deliver higher efficiency solar panels, meaning lower costs,\u201d Chen said.\n\nCompared to the silicon-based solar panels that currently dominate the market, PSCs weigh less, allowing for reduced installation costs, according to Chen.\n\nDuring production, PSCs also require one-eighth of the heat energy of silicon ingots, further decreasing environmental and monetary costs, according to Chen.\n\nChen said the study is part of a larger effort to investigate the reliability and durability of PSCs as researchers look for clean energy alternatives to power the future.\n\n\u201cWe see a really big global community driving toward the same goal, which is to make perovskites and solar cells better,\u201d Chen said.\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n\u2014 Research Roundup: AI in maternal health, quantum teleportation, developments in Parkinson\u2019s genetic research\n\n\u2014 CIERA facilitates interdisciplinary research in astrophysics\n\n\u2014 Northwestern Researchers look into SuperAgers at the Mesulam Center"

            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nAI is already reshaping industries and society on a global scale. IDC predicts that AI will contribute $19.9 trillion to the global economy by 2030, comprising 3.5% of GDP. This momentum is exemplified by the recent announcement of \u201cProject Stargate,\u201d a partnership to invest up to $100 billion in new AI-focused data center capacity. This is all indicative of the tremendous activity going on with AI development. On a single day, AI made headlines for discovering proteins to counteract cobra venom, creating a Star Trek-style universal translator and paving the way for true AI assistants.\n\nThese and other developments highlight individual achievements, as well as their interconnected progress. This flywheel of innovation is where breakthroughs in one domain amplify advancements in others, compounding AI\u2019s transformative potential.\n\nSeparating signal from noise\n\nEven for someone who follows AI developments closely, the rapid technological breakthroughs and diffusion across industries and applications is dizzying, making it highly challenging to not only know and understand what is going on, but understand the relative importance of developments. It is challenging to separate the signal from noise.\n\nIn the past, I might have turned to an AI industry analyst to help explain the dynamics and meaning of recent and projected developments. This time, I decided instead to see if AI itself might be able to help me. This led me to a conversation with OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. The 4o model might have worked as effectively, but I expected that a reasoning model such as o1 might be more effective.\n\nI asked o1 what it thought were the top AI trends and why. I started by asking for the top 10 to 15, but over the course of our collaborative dialog, this expanded to 25. Yes, there really are that many, which is a testament to AI\u2019s value as a general-purpose technology.\n\nIn dialog about leading AI trends with OpenAI\u2019s o1 model.\n\nAfter about 30 seconds of inference-time \u201cthinking,\u201d o1 responded with a list of trends in AI development and use, ranked according to their potential significance and impact on business and society. I asked several qualifying questions and made a few suggestions that led to slight changes in the evaluation method and rankings.\n\nMethodology\n\nRankings of the various AI trends are determined by a blended heuristic that balances multiple factors including both quantitative indicators (near-term commercial viability) and qualitative judgments (disruptive potential and near-term societal impact) further described as follows:\n\nCurrent commercial viability: The trend\u2019s market presence and adoption.\n\nLong term disruptive potential: How a trend could significantly reshape industries and create new markets.\n\nSocietal impact: Weighing the immediate and near-term effects on society, including accessibility, ethics and daily life.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the overall AI trend rankings, each trend receives a long-term social transformation score (STS), ranging from incremental improvements (6) to civilization-altering breakthroughs (10). The STS reflects the trend\u2019s maximum potential impact if fully realized, offering an absolute measure of transformational significance.\n\nLevels of social transformation associated with top AI trends.\n\nThe development of this ranking process reflects the potential of human-AI collaboration. o1 provided a foundation for identifying and ranking trends, while my human oversight helped ensure that the insights were contextualized and relevant. The result shows how humans and AI can work together to navigate complexity.\n\nTop AI trends in 2025\n\nFor tech leaders, developers and enthusiasts alike, these trends signal both immense opportunity and significant challenges in navigating the many changes brought by AI. Highly-ranked trends typically have broad current adoption, high commercial viability or significant near-term disruptive effects.\n\nTable of top 10 trends for 2025 ranked on current commercial viability, long-term disruptive potential and potential for social impact. Specific use cases \u2014 like self-driving cars or personal assistant robots \u2014 are not considered individual trends but are instead subsumed within the broader foundational trends.\n\nHonorable mention list: AI trends 11 \u2013 25\n\nOne can quibble whether number 11 or any of the following should be in the top 10, but keep in mind that these are relative rankings and include a certain amount of subjectivity (whether from o1 or from me), based on our iterative conversation. I suppose this is not too different from the conversations that take place within any research organization when completing their reports ranking the comparative merits of trends. In general, this next set of trends has significant potential but are either: 1) not yet as widespread and/or 2) have a potential payoff that is still several or more years away.\n\nWhile these trends did not make the top 10, they showcase the expanding influence of AI across healthcare, sustainability and other critical domains.\n\nTable of top 11 to 25 trends for 2025 ranked on current commercial viability, long-term disruptive potential and potential for societal impact.\n\nDigital humans show the innovation flywheel in action\n\nOne use case that highlights the convergence of these trends is digital humans, which exemplify how foundational and emerging AI technologies come together to drive transformative innovation. These AI-powered avatars create lifelike, engaging interactions and span roles such as digital coworkers, tutors, personal assistants, entertainers and companions. Their development shows how interconnected AI trends create transformative innovations.\n\nThe flywheel of AI innovation: Interconnected advancements in AI technologies drive transformative progress, where breakthroughs in one domain amplify developments in others, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of innovation leading to new uses.\n\nFor example, these lifelike avatars are developed using the capabilities of generative AI (trend 1) for natural conversation, explainable AI (2) to build trust through transparency and agentic AI (3) for autonomous decision-making. With synthetic data generation, digital humans are trained on diverse, privacy-preserving datasets, ensuring they adapt to cultural and contextual nuances. Meanwhile, edge AI (5) enables near real-time responsiveness and multi-modal AI (17) enhances interactions by integrating text, audio and visual elements.\n\nBy using the technologies described by these trends, digital humans exemplify how advancements in one domain can accelerate progress in others, transforming industries and redefining human-AI collaboration. As digital humans continue to evolve, they not only exemplify the flywheel of innovation, but also underscore the transformative potential of AI to redefine how humans interact with technology.\n\nWhy are AGI and ASI so far down the list?\n\nThe future is, indeed, hard to predict.

Learn More\n\nAI is already reshaping industries and society on a global scale. IDC predicts that AI will contribute $19.9 trillion to the global economy by 2030, comprising 3.5% of GDP. This momentum is exemplified by the recent announcement of \u201cProject Stargate,\u201d a partnership to invest up to $100 billion in new AI-focused data center capacity. This is all indicative of the tremendous activity going on with AI development. On a single day, AI made headlines for discovering proteins to counteract cobra venom, creating a Star Trek-style universal translator and paving the way for true AI assistants.\n\nThese and other developments highlight individual achievements, as well as their interconnected progress. This flywheel of innovation is where breakthroughs in one domain amplify advancements in others, compounding AI\u2019s transformative potential.\n\nSeparating signal from noise\n\nEven for someone who follows AI developments closely, the rapid technological breakthroughs and diffusion across industries and applications is dizzying, making it highly challenging to not only know and understand what is going on, but understand the relative importance of developments. It is challenging to separate the signal from noise.\n\nIn the past, I might have turned to an AI industry analyst to help explain the dynamics and meaning of recent and projected developments. This time, I decided instead to see if AI itself might be able to help me. This led me to a conversation with OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. The 4o model might have worked as effectively, but I expected that a reasoning model such as o1 might be more effective.\n\nI asked o1 what it thought were the top AI trends and why. I started by asking for the top 10 to 15, but over the course of our collaborative dialog, this expanded to 25. Yes, there really are that many, which is a testament to AI\u2019s value as a general-purpose technology.\n\nIn dialog about leading AI trends with OpenAI\u2019s o1 model.\n\nAfter about 30 seconds of inference-time \u201cthinking,\u201d o1 responded with a list of trends in AI development and use, ranked according to their potential significance and impact on business and society. I asked several qualifying questions and made a few suggestions that led to slight changes in the evaluation method and rankings.\n\nMethodology\n\nRankings of the various AI trends are determined by a blended heuristic that balances multiple factors including both quantitative indicators (near-term commercial viability) and qualitative judgments (disruptive potential and near-term societal impact) further described as follows:\n\nCurrent commercial viability: The trend\u2019s market presence and adoption.\n\nLong term disruptive potential: How a trend could significantly reshape industries and create new markets.\n\nSocietal impact: Weighing the immediate and near-term effects on society, including accessibility, ethics and daily life.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the overall AI trend rankings, each trend receives a long-term social transformation score (STS), ranging from incremental improvements (6) to civilization-altering breakthroughs (10). The STS reflects the trend\u2019s maximum potential impact if fully realized, offering an absolute measure of transformational significance.\n\nLevels of social transformation associated with top AI trends.\n\nThe development of this ranking process reflects the potential of human-AI collaboration. o1 provided a foundation for identifying and ranking trends, while my human oversight helped ensure that the insights were contextualized and relevant. The result shows how humans and AI can work together to navigate complexity.\n\nTop AI trends in 2025\n\nFor tech leaders, developers and enthusiasts alike, these trends signal both immense opportunity and significant challenges in navigating the many changes brought by AI. Highly-ranked trends typically have broad current adoption, high commercial viability or significant near-term disruptive effects.\n\nTable of top 10 trends for 2025 ranked on current commercial viability, long-term disruptive potential and potential for social impact. Specific use cases \u2014 like self-driving cars or personal assistant robots \u2014 are not considered individual trends but are instead subsumed within the broader foundational trends.\n\nHonorable mention list: AI trends 11 \u2013 25\n\nOne can quibble whether number 11 or any of the following should be in the top 10, but keep in mind that these are relative rankings and include a certain amount of subjectivity (whether from o1 or from me), based on our iterative conversation. I suppose this is not too different from the conversations that take place within any research organization when completing their reports ranking the comparative merits of trends. In general, this next set of trends has significant potential but are either: 1) not yet as widespread and/or 2) have a potential payoff that is still several or more years away.\n\nWhile these trends did not make the top 10, they showcase the expanding influence of AI across healthcare, sustainability and other critical domains.\n\nTable of top 11 to 25 trends for 2025 ranked on current commercial viability, long-term disruptive potential and potential for societal impact.\n\nDigital humans show the innovation flywheel in action\n\nOne use case that highlights the convergence of these trends is digital humans, which exemplify how foundational and emerging AI technologies come together to drive transformative innovation. These AI-powered avatars create lifelike, engaging interactions and span roles such as digital coworkers, tutors, personal assistants, entertainers and companions. Their development shows how interconnected AI trends create transformative innovations.\n\nThe flywheel of AI innovation: Interconnected advancements in AI technologies drive transformative progress, where breakthroughs in one domain amplify developments in others, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of innovation leading to new uses.\n\nFor example, these lifelike avatars are developed using the capabilities of generative AI (trend 1) for natural conversation, explainable AI (2) to build trust through transparency and agentic AI (3) for autonomous decision-making. With synthetic data generation, digital humans are trained on diverse, privacy-preserving datasets, ensuring they adapt to cultural and contextual nuances. Meanwhile, edge AI (5) enables near real-time responsiveness and multi-modal AI (17) enhances interactions by integrating text, audio and visual elements.\n\nBy using the technologies described by these trends, digital humans exemplify how advancements in one domain can accelerate progress in others, transforming industries and redefining human-AI collaboration. As digital humans continue to evolve, they not only exemplify the flywheel of innovation, but also underscore the transformative potential of AI to redefine how humans interact with technology.\n\nWhy are AGI and ASI so far down the list?\n\nThe future is, indeed, hard to predict. Many expect artificial general intelligence (AGI) to be achieved soon. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said recently: \u201cWe are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it.\u201d However, that is different from saying that AGI is imminent. It also does not mean that all agree on the definition of AGI. For OpenAI, this means \u201ca highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d\n\nMark Zuckerberg said he believes that in 2025 Meta will \u201chave an AI that can effectively be a sort of midlevel engineer\u201d that can write code. That is clearly economically viable work and could be used to claim the arrival of AGI. Perhaps, but even Altman is now saying that AGI is not arriving soon.\n\nSource: https://x.com/sama/status/1881258443669172470\n\nGoogle Deepmind co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis said recently on the Big Technology podcast that AGI is likely \u201ca handful of years away.\u201d He added, however, that there is a 50% chance another one or two significant breakthroughs on the order of the transformer model that led to generative AI will still be needed to fully achieve AGI.\n\nSuperintelligence, too, could eventually be achieved in the next 5 to 10 years. Altman and Elon Musk have said as much, although the consensus expert opinion is closer to 2040 \u2014 and some believe it will never be achieved.

If achieved, the impact of superintelligence would be enormous \u2014 but at present, this \u201cif\u201d precludes this from the top 10 list.\n\nChoosing the right AI collaborator(s)\n\nAfter taking on this venture, I discovered some crucial elements to consider in the choice of AI collaborators. While o1 offered valuable insights into leading AI trends, its cutoff date for training data was October 2023, and it lacks web browsing capabilities. This became clear when it initially suggested No. 12 for agentic AI, a trend that has advanced rapidly in the last several months.

            "article_content": "Free Newsletter Get the hottest Fintech Singapore News once a month in your Inbox\n\nPayment trends in Asia are changing how businesses and people transact \u2014 from the digital-first economies of China and Singapore to the quickly changing markets of Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\nThis shift is not merely a matter of convenience; it is emblematic of an increasingly complex convergence between state-of-the-art technology, consumer desires for seamlessness, and the region\u2019s particular socio-economic landscape.\n\nEmerging trends such as cross-border payment systems and open banking initiatives are breaking down traditional barriers, fostering greater connectivity and efficiency in Asia\u2019s financial landscape.\n\nHowever, the rapid progress comes with challenges. The shift toward digitised payments brings heightened concerns about cybersecurity, fraud, and regulatory compliance. As Asian markets surge, they face the dual challenge of safeguarding digital infrastructure while ensuring financial inclusion and bridging technological gaps between advanced and developing economies.\n\nThis article explores five key trends changing how we pay today while pushing the narrative for a more efficient, powerful financial ecosystem in Asia.\n\n1. China Leads Again in Digital Payment Adoption\n\nDigital payment adoption is soaring across Asia, with CNBC highlighting the region\u2019s leadership in this segment, driven largely by Southeast Asians emerging as the most avid users of digital wallets.\n\nAs of June 2024, China maintains its leadership in digital wallet adoption, with over 88% of mobile internet users\u2014 approximately 969 million individuals \u2014 engaging in mobile payments. Back in 2023, digital wallets accounted for 82% of China\u2019s e-commerce spending and 66% of physical purchases, totalling around US$7.6 trillion in transactions, CNBC reports.\n\nAlipay and WeChat Pay dominate China\u2019s digital payment landscape, making it the largest and most influential wallet market globally, according to Worldpay\u2019s The Global payments Report 2024.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, digital payment transactions are projected to exceed US$1 trillion by 2025. According to a study by Bain & Company, Google, and Temasek, 53% of industry experts believe that consumer tech platforms, rather than pure-play fintechs, are more likely to drive disruption in financial services.\n\nIn 2023, credit card payments comprised 52.2% of all cashless transactions in Japan. However, the country has shown that its consumers\u2019 reliance on credit cards and electronic money has gradually decreased, while QR code and barcode payments have experienced remarkable growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the Economic Times reported that the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) facilitated over 15,547 crore transactions worth INR 223 lakh crore (US$258.59 billion) in India from January to November 2024. In 2025, UPI is expected to become an omnipresent network, transforming connected devices into potential payment endpoints through messaging platforms like WhatsApp.\n\n2. Real-Time Payments Bridging Asia Pacific Borders\n\nReal-time and cross-border payments are becoming a reality, thanks to regional collaborations and technological advancements. Project Nexus of Singapore, for example, aims to connect real-time payment systems across the region, further facilitating seamless cross-border transactions. This initiative demonstrates the growing focus on regional collaboration in the payments sector.\n\nMeanwhile, corporate efforts, such as Visa\u2019s initiatives to enable QR code payments across borders, are further driving the adoption of real-time cross-border payments.\n\nReal-time payments are surging across Asia-Pacific, are expected to grow from 49.2 billion in 2022 to 96.2 billion by 2027. Singapore\u2019s PayNow and Thailand\u2019s PromptPay have established a successful cross-border linkage, while Malaysia\u2019s DuitNow and Indonesia\u2019s QRIS integration has been operational for a few years already.\n\nThis trend is driven by a combination of regional cooperation, corporate innovation, and technological advancements, setting the stage for a more interconnected and efficient financial ecosystem in the region.\n\n3. Embedded Finance Hailed as the Future of Fintech\n\nThe embedded payments market is expected to reach a global transaction value of US$2.5 trillion by 2028, according to a LexisNexis study. In Asia, the adoption of embedded finance is creating opportunities across diverse sectors.\n\nChina, a global leader in digital wallet adoption, has its embedded finance market seamlessly integrating payments into consumer apps at scale thanks to its extensive digital wallet adoption. Platforms like WeChat and Alipay allow their users to conduct transactions for everyday purchases, transportation, and even healthcare services effortlessly.\n\nIndia\u2019s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is another backbone of embedded payments. The transformative impact of UPI underscores the potential of integrated financial systems.\n\nWith nearly 300 million individuals and 50 million merchants in India relying on UPI for transactions, it has become the country\u2019s most widely used payment method, the World Economic Forum reports. Its influence is now reaching beyond India\u2019s borders, with countries like Singapore and the UAE adopting the system, marking its growing global presence.\n\nIn Japan, while cash is still widely used, embedded finance is starting to gain momentum and expected to hit US$ 36.29 billion by 2029, according to Business Wire. Rakuten has also introduced its own cryptocurrency wallets and exchange systems there, bringing embedded finance to new levels by allowing Rakuten Cash balance recharges via Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe global embedded finance market is projected to reach US$384.8 billion by 2029, while traditional banks stand to gain $92 billion in additional revenue from SMEs through embedded finance by 2025, LexisNexis also reports.\n\nKey benefits of embedded finance include faster payment processing, improved operational efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction, making it an attractive proposition for financial and non-financial businesses alike.\n\nAs Asia continues to lead global payment trends, embedded finance is unlocking new possibilities for innovation, inclusivity, and growth, positioning the region as a pioneer in shaping the future of financial services.\n\n4. Open Banking APIs Are Shaping the Future of Payments\n\nOpen banking is on the brink of rapid expansion in Southeast Asia, though progress varies across countries. This trend is fostering innovation and competition in the financial services sector.\n\nIn Singapore, the government-backed API Exchange is promoting API standardisation. Indonesia\u2019s Standard National Open API (SNAP) , on the other end, was launched to support the country\u2019s Indonesian Payment System Blueprint (BSPI) 2025 initiative, with the purpose to drive efficiency for bank digital payments.\n\nIn Hong Kong, HSBC introduced its first open banking feature on the local HSBC HK app, enabling its clientele to view account balances from Bank of China Hong Kong and Hang Seng Bank in real time. This was enabled via the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\u2019s Interbank Account Data Sharing (IADS) initiative.\n\nOpen banking APIs has the potential bolster B2B payments in the region. According to PYMNTS, APIs could potentially solving the complexity around account payable, account receivables, approval workflows and more, enabling more efficient and secure transactions between businesses, which is typically just one part of the entire process.\n\nIn the context of B2B payments, APIs allow financial institutions, payment processors, and business software platforms to seamlessly integrate payment capabilities into their existing systems. By simplifying the integration process, it lowers the barriers for businesses to adopt digital B2B payment solutions, enabling smoother transitions and greater accessibility.\n\nThis development could likely to have a significant impact on the overall payments ecosystem in Asia.\n\n5.The Need for Robust Cybersecurity Measures to Combat Financial Crime\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s digital economy is on track to exceed USD 300 billion in gross merchandise volume by 2025, presenting significant financial crime challenges, reports PwC. Non-bank financial service entrants, new to the system, often lack the robust cybersecurity infrastructure necessary to combat sophisticated cyber threats.\n\nThis deficiency is exacerbated by the growing consumer demand for faster payments with minimal checks, increasing vulnerability to financial crimes. The adoption of preventive technologies like biometrics and in-session analytical solutions is essential for comprehensive protection.\n\nMastercard has made efforts underway to phase out passwords with tokenization and biometrics by 2030 while in terms of Asian countries adopting the digital identity, Singapore is a pioneer with Singpass, a Smart Nation initiative.\n\nUsing biometrics, Singpass enables secure and convenient access to 800+ government agencies and businesses and over 2,700 services. Meanwhile, Malaysia is making steady strides with its MyDigital ID initiative, paving the way for advanced digital identity solutions, including eKYC verification in the near future.\n\nNotably, while Singapore and Malaysia rank high globally for cybersecurity based on the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2020, other Southeast Asian nations like Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia are ranked 99th, 131st, and 132nd out of 182 countries, respectively, PwC reports also.\n\nThis disparity suggests a pressing need to enhance cybersecurity across the region. Implementing digital IDs and related authentication mechanisms can play a pivotal role in counteracting criminal activities.\n\nA unified approach against financial crime is essential, and reliance on cross-border digital IDs may be key to eradicating synthetic ID fraud. Increased sharing of tactical information through intergovernmental or public-private partnerships could enable greater financial transparency and build stronger defences against financial crime.\n\nAsia\u2019s Digital Financial Frontier \u2013 Opportunities and Challenges Ahead\n\nAs we look towards 2025 and beyond, it\u2019s clear that Asia\u2019s payment landscape is at the forefront of global financial innovation. The region\u2019s embrace of digital wallets, real-time payments, BNPL services, cryptocurrencies, open banking, and advanced cybersecurity measures is creating a dynamic and interconnected financial ecosystem.\n\nThis transformation is not just about convenience; it\u2019s about financial inclusion, economic growth, and technological leadership.However, with great innovation comes great responsibility. As these trends accelerate, regulators, businesses, and consumers must work together to ensure that this digital financial revolution remains secure, inclusive, and sustainable.\n\nThe challenges of cybersecurity and regulatory compliance loom large, but so do the opportunities for unprecedented financial access and economic empowerment. Asia\u2019s payment trends for 2025 paint a picture of a region that is not just adapting to the future of finance, but actively shaping it.\n\nFrom China\u2019s dominance in digital payments to the rise of cryptocurrency in Vietnam and Indonesia, from the cross-border innovations in Singapore and Thailand to the BNPL boom across Southeast Asia, the region is setting the pace for global fintech innovation.\n\nAs we navigate this rapidly evolving landscape, one thing is certain: the way we think about and use money is changing forever, and Asia is leading the charge. The future of payments is not just digital \u2013 it\u2019s dynamic, diverse, and decidedly Asian.\n\nSource of image: edited from Freepik"

            "article_content": "Scientists recently reported an unexpected deep-sea development in the Pacific: certain metallic rocks seem to be making oxygen in the dark, without light or sunshine, at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThis idea runs counter to the usual belief that oxygen only forms in sunlight through photosynthesis.\n\nAlthough these findings have stirred debate, the central claim is that potato-sized nodules found thousands of feet below the surface appear to split seawater molecules and release oxygen.\n\nOxygen and photosynthesis \u2013 the basics\n\nSince the late 1700s, we\u2019ve been taught that light creates oxygen through photosynthesis, a crucial natural process that keeps life on Earth thriving.\n\nPlants, algae, and some bacteria soak up sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, nature uses light as fuel to produce the oxygen we breathe and keep everything on Earth alive.\n\nPhotosynthesis not only gives energy to these organisms but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, maintaining the perfect balance of gases that most life forms need.\n\nUntil the discovery of dark oxygen, it has been commonly accepted knowledge that without light, photosynthesis would grind to a halt, and our planet wouldn\u2019t have the oxygen-rich air we rely on every day.\n\nDeep-sea rocks making oxygen\n\nExploration in a region called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone \u2013 where deep-sea mining companies are eyeing metals resources like cobalt and nickel \u2013 uncovered ferromanganese nodules resting on the ocean floor.\n\nFerromanganese nodules are like little treasure rocks that settle on the ocean floor, packed with metals such as manganese and iron.\n\nThese nodules form slowly over millions of years as minerals from seawater build up in layers around a tiny core, like a shark tooth or a piece of shell.\n\nThink of them as underwater onions, with each layer adding more minerals and creating these cool, rounded shapes.\n\nResearchers suggested that the nodules may produce electric charges that spark electrolysis, generating oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nHow do the rocks produce oxygen?\n\nEarly studies raised plenty of questions about the process and the potential effect on seafloor life.\n\nLeading the push for more answers is Andrew Sweetman, a professor at the Scottish Association for Marine Science.\n\nHe is running a three-year project to investigate how these nodules might form oxygen in the absence of light. One of his goals is to see if this phenomenon appears in other parts of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.\n\n\u201cOur discovery of dark oxygen was a paradigm shift in our understanding of the deep sea and potentially life on Earth, but it threw up more questions than answers,\u201d said Sweetman.\n\nHe and his team will also look into whether microbial reactions help release hydrogen, an energy source for certain deep-sea microbes.\n\nFreshwater mysteries\n\nDark oxygen has popped up in other surprising, light-deprived places.\n\nEmil Ruff detected oxygen in freshwater samples beneath Alberta, Canada. It appeared in groundwater that had been isolated for tens of thousands of years, yet still contained enough oxygen to support life.\n\n\u201cAfter 40,000 years or 30,000 years (separated from surface processes), there\u2019s no reason really to think that there should be any oxygen left,\u201d remarked Ruff.\n\nHe found that special bacteria could produce oxygen on their own by breaking down certain dissolved compounds.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ruff found that the quantity of oxygen produced was enough to sustain other oxygen-dependent microbial life in the groundwater.\n\nChallenging dark oxygen\n\nNot all scientists are in agreement about this dark oxygen discovery. Some deep-sea mining interests challenged Sweetman\u2019s work, saying they have found no such electrical oddities in the nodules.\n\nThe Metals Co. submitted a rebuttal of the scientific research paper to Nature Geoscience, which awaits peer review.\n\nMeanwhile, independent observers note the need for more experiments. A research oceanographer at the US Geological Survey\u2019s Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California, said the USGS has not observed any electrical phenomena in ferromanganese nodules examined so far.\n\nShe was not involved in either Sweetman\u2019s or Ruff\u2019s research.\n\nNASA hopes these findings might hint at life in places beyond Earth. Dark ocean worlds like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus are prime targets for research.\n\nSweetman shared that the space agency wants to test whether high pressures found on those icy moons can trigger oxygen generation in deep-sea rocks without direct sunlight. If the same basic chemistry works there, it could point to possible microbial life in alien seas.\n\nDark oxygen and deep-sea mining\n\nThe Clarion-Clipperton Zone sits far offshore, and mining there is governed by the International Seabed Authority. Critics argue that removing nodules in huge volumes could destroy habitats.\n\nOrganizations like Fauna & Flora warn of irreparable harm, saying it may disturb carbon storage in the ocean. Sweetman believes it is risky to harvest seabed minerals until scientists know a lot more about these systems.\n\nHe acknowledges the controversy and plans to address critics in peer-reviewed forums. For now, the hunt for hard data continues, fueled by the hope of expanding our understanding of life \u2013 both here and possibly on other worlds.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Geoscience.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "On March 15, 2024, a space-based observatory detected bursts of low-energy X-rays from deep in the ancient universe, fluctuating in brightness for over 17 minutes before fading away. About an hour later, ground-based telescopes picked up visible light from the same source, tracing it back to when the universe was only around one billion years old.\n\nThe newly launched Einstein Probe is already spotting distant explosions with the potential to upend what we know about the universe\u2019s earliest years. Using its wide-field X-ray telescope, the spacecraft detected so-called soft, or low-energy, X-rays, that lasted for an unusually long period of time. These events are known as fast X-ray transients (FXRT), and the newly spotted blast has been designated EP240315a.\n\nAfter monitoring the burst at radio wavelengths for a period of three months, the team of astronomers behind the detection confirmed that the energy output was consistent with a gamma-ray burst dating back to when the universe was only 10 percent of its current age. So given the universe\u2019s estimated age of 13.8 billion years, the burst occurred when the universe was approximately 1.38 billion years old.\n\n\u201cThese results show that a substantial fraction of FXRTs may be associated with [gamma-ray bursts] and that sensitive X-ray monitors, such as Einstein Probe can pinpoint them in the distant Universe,\u201d Roberto Ricci, a researcher at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy, and one of the authors behind the new paper detailing the discovery, said in a statement. \u201cCombining the power of X-ray and radio observations hands us a new way to explore these ancient explosions even without detecting their gamma rays.\u201d\n\nEP240315a marks the first time soft X-rays were detected from an ancient explosion that lasted for such a long duration. Follow-up observations using the Gemini-North telescope in Hawaii and the Very Large Telescope in Chile measured visible light from the same location that confirmed the burst had come from around 12.5 billion light-years away.\n\nGamma-ray bursts are brief flashes of high-energy light and the most powerful explosions in the universe, typically triggered by the collapse of massive stars or the merger of neutron stars. Those bursts are also known to emit copious amounts of X-rays. The recently discovered soft X-rays were traced back to GRB 240315C, a gamma-ray burst first detected by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on NASA\u2019s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, with additional data provided by the Konus instrument aboard NASA\u2019s Wind spacecraft.\n\nAlthough gamma-ray bursts are associated with X-rays, the newly discovered fast X-ray transient is an anomaly. The X-rays typically precede the gamma rays by a few tens of seconds, but EP240315a was seen more than six minutes (372 seconds) before GRB 240315C. \u201cSuch a long delay has never been previously observed,\u201d Hui Sun, a team member from the Einstein Probe Science Center at the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and co-author of the new study, said in a statement.\n\nThe mystery behind the long duration of time between the X-rays and the gamma-ray burst, in addition to the long duration of the X-rays themselves, are reason to question whether gamma-ray bursts explode the way scientists believe them to.\n\nThe Einstein Probe, an X-ray telescope managed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and built in collaboration with European Space Agency and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, launched on January 9, 2024. Its Wide-field X-ray Telescope takes in X-ray light in square tubes in a grid, which means it can observe 3,600 square degrees (just under one-tenth of the celestial sphere) in a single shot.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we opened the eyes of Einstein Probe to the sky, it found interesting new phenomena,\u201d Erik Kuulkers, ESA\u2019s Einstein Probe project scientist, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good and should mean that there are a lot more interesting discoveries to come.\u201d"

            "article_content": "From outer space to Northwestern labs, researchers at the University have recently made notable advancements in astrophysics and chemistry. The Daily compiled a recap of their latest research developments.\n\nTracking a fast radio burst to an unlikely galaxy for the first time\n\nIn collaboration with colleagues at McGill University, NU researchers located and tracked a fast radio burst to an inactive galaxy two billion light-years away. The finding further complicates the mystery of these short-duration radio wave emissions by contrasting prevailing theories that FRBs originate in galaxies with active star formations, according to a news release.\n\nThe group of researchers first identified this specific FRB last February using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment radio telescope.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another mystery of the universe that I\u2019d like to explore,\u201d said Tarraneh Eftekhari, a NASA Hubble Einstein Fellow and researcher. \u201cIt was really, really surprising and also exciting to see.\u201d\n\nAs additional, smaller versions of CHIME \u2014 known as outrigger telescopes \u2014 come online, researchers believe they can localize the FRBs with finer precision, according to Eftekhari.\n\n\u201cIn the not too distant future, I think we\u2019ll revolutionize the field, so I\u2019m very excited for that,\u201d Eftekhari said.\n\nImproving the quality of perovskite solar cells\n\nNU researchers discovered a new method to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells, or solar cells with a crystal structure. The team, led by chemistry Prof. Ted Sargent, published its findings Jan. 9 in the academic journal Joule, according to a news release.\n\nPSCs offer a potential alternative to costly, silicon-based solar panels, chemistry Prof. Bin Chen said in an interview with The Daily.\n\n\u201cThere are many emerging technologies, and perovskites promise to deliver higher efficiency solar panels, meaning lower costs,\u201d Chen said.\n\nCompared to the silicon-based solar panels that currently dominate the market, PSCs weigh less, allowing for reduced installation costs, according to Chen.\n\nDuring production, PSCs also require one-eighth of the heat energy of silicon ingots, further decreasing environmental and monetary costs, according to Chen.\n\nChen said the study is part of a larger effort to investigate the reliability and durability of PSCs as researchers look for clean energy alternatives to power the future.\n\n\u201cWe see a really big global community driving toward the same goal, which is to make perovskites and solar cells better,\u201d Chen said.\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n\u2014 Research Roundup: AI in maternal health, quantum teleportation, developments in Parkinson\u2019s genetic research\n\n\u2014 CIERA facilitates interdisciplinary research in astrophysics\n\n\u2014 Northwestern Researchers look into SuperAgers at the Mesulam Center"

US stock futures nosedived, led by steep losses in Nasdaq contracts, and Japanese chipmaker stocks faced heavy selling. On the other hand, Chinese and Hong Kong tech shares are surging on optimism over DeepSeek\u2019s rapid rise, raising fresh questions about the future dominance of US tech giants like Nvidia and Google.\n\nUS futures fall, Japan shares tumble, China markets cheer\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nUS stock index futures tumbled during Asian trading hours on Monday, with S&P 500 futures falling as much as 1 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures dropping nearly 1.9 percent. The sell-off reflects growing investor concern that DeepSeek\u2019s cost-efficient AI model, developed using reduced-capability chips, could disrupt the business models of US giants like Nvidia Corp., OpenAI, and Google, reported Bloomberg.\n\nMeanwhile, Asian markets offered a mixed response. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 2 percent, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 futures dropped 0.6 percent. Shares of Advantest Corp., a major supplier to Nvidia, plunged 8.6 percent in Tokyo trading, while SoftBank Group Corp., which surged last week on AI infrastructure plans, fell 5.4 percent.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s revolutionary AI model: Low cost, high impact\n\nA Forbes report said that DeepSeek has sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley with its AI model, developed at a cost of just $5.6 million. Unlike its US counterparts, DeepSeek relies on open-source technology and lower-end chips, sidestepping the need for high-end hardware restricted by US export controls.\n\nFounded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a hedge fund and AI industry veteran, DeepSeek is funded solely by Wenfeng\u2019s quantitative hedge fund, High-Flyer. This unique structure allows the company to focus on long-term research without the constraints of external investors.\n\nGlobal implications: US tech dominance disrupted\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\n\u201cDeepSeek\u2019s release is deeply problematic for the thesis that massive capital expenditure is necessary for AI dominance,\u201d said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer and internet at Aletheia Capital, in an interview with Bloomberg. Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets, added, \u201cWhile Nvidia has a strong foothold, DeepSeek's emergence underscores that AI dominance cannot be taken for granted.\u201d\n\nThe impact extends beyond the US. Chinese AI-linked stocks rallied in response to DeepSeek\u2019s success, with the Shanghai Composite rising 0.2 percent and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng climbing 0.7 percent. However, chipmakers in Japan, such as Advantest and Disco Corp., faced significant losses amid fears of reduced demand for high-end AI chips.\n\nWhile DeepSeek\u2019s innovative AI model has reshaped market dynamics, it still faces challenges in competing with US tech giants. Forbes said that the company suffers from a significant compute disadvantage, exacerbated by US export restrictions on advanced chips. Bridging this gap will be essential for DeepSeek to scale its operations and compete globally.\n\nThe road ahead for US tech\n\nThe timing of DeepSeek\u2019s release adds to the pressure on US tech firms, many of which are set to report earnings this week. Analysts expect profit growth for companies like Apple and Microsoft to have slowed, further intensifying concerns about inflated valuations in the AI sector.\n\nKyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com, told Bloomberg, \u201cThe proverbial arms race in AI investment has taken a very interesting turn. China\u2019s advancements will undoubtedly catch the ire of the Trump administration, raising geopolitical risks for US firms.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

In addition, the trailing 12-month (TTM) trend in revenue shows that after a spike between FY21 and FY22 amid the post-pandemic boom, the revenue growth for each of the five companies has fallen below the levels seen five years ago, impacted by a slack in the demand for discretionary projects - long-term contracts which are transformational in nature - amid the rising focus of clients to achieve cost efficiency for existing processes.The TTM method tends to smoothen out quarterly volatility thereby offering a better understanding of the long-term trend. Considering the TTM dollar denominated revenue, the aggregate revenue of the top five IT exporters recorded a year-on-year growth of 2.4% in the December quarter, led by 5.3% growth in the country's third largest IT exporter HCLTech's TTM revenue at $13,771.8 million and 4% in $30,077 million revenue reported by TCS , the largest IT exporter. On the other hand Wipro and Tech Mahindra , the fourth and the fifth largest Indian IT exporters by that order showed a drop of 3.6% and 2.1% respectively in their TTM revenues. For Infosys , the second largest IT exporter, TTM revenue rose by 3% to $6,263.3 million.Though the December quarter TTM revenue growth for the sample was the highest in four quarters, it has been on a gradual decline compared with the growth ten quarters ago. For instance, it peaked at 18.1% in the March 2022 quarter on the back of a tepid 1.7% increase in the year-ago quarter affected due to the Covid pandemic. However, since the March 2022 quarter, it has gradually fallen.The top line growth is expected to pick up in the coming quarters amid hopes of a revival in discretionary projects. Each of the top companies continued to report a sustained momentum in new deal wins in the December quarter thereby improving revenue visibility. In rupee terms, the sample's aggregate revenue rose by 0.9% to \u20b91.7 lakh crore while net profit grew by 3.7% to \u20b928,126 crore in the December quarter. HCLTech reported the strongest growth of 3.6% and 8.4% in revenue and net profit at \u20b929,890 crore and \u20b94,591 crore in that order."

            "article_content": "Agentic artificial intelligence is set to transform business this year, replacing workers as the technology can think and make decisions, offering companies the chance to cut costs\n\nListen to this article\n\nAccording to Gartner, agentic AI is a top strategic technology trend in 2025.\n\nLeading businesses in Thailand have begun to embrace agentic artificial intelligence (AI) to pilot selective tasks, in a bid to explore its benefits.\n\nThe term refers to an AI system with enhanced autonomy, decision-making capabilities and adaptability. Agentic AI systems autonomously plan and take actions to meet user-defined goals, offering the promise of a virtual workforce that can offload and augment human work.\n\nAccording to global research and consultancy Gartner, agentic AI is a top strategic technology trend in 2025 that is poised to drive innovation, offering significant business benefits by providing a virtual workforce of AI agents.\n\nHowever, the implementation of agentic AI also presents challenges, particularly in ensuring that these autonomous systems are aligned with the intentions of both the providers and users.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial to establish robust safeguards and guardrails that guarantee AI's actions remain consistent with the desired outcomes, said Gartner.\n\nThe company predicts by 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, enabling 15% of day-to-day work decisions to be made autonomously.\n\nFirst in the region\n\n\"In 2025, agentic AI will be a key trend, combining AI and automation,\" said Anothai Wettayakorn, managing director of IBM Thailand.\n\nThe rise of agentic AI marks a significant shift in the future of work, with AI agents autonomously executing tasks, collaborating with human workers, and driving value across businesses, he said.\n\nIn Thailand, IBM successfully completed a pilot initiative using generative AI (GenAI) to automate laboratory orders, enhancing patient diagnosis and improving confidence, quality and speed in treatment.\n\nThis collaboration took place with Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, an affiliate of Chiang Mai University's Faculty of Medicine.\n\nThis was the first agentic AI use in Southeast Asia for healthcare, said Mr Anothai.\n\nAfter an eight-month pilot and an investment of 10 million baht, IBM's agentic AI technology leverages existing automation in the hospital's laboratory and hospital data system to speed up patient services.\n\nThe initiative minimises repetitive tasks for doctors and nurses, said Dr Bannakij Lojanapiwat, faculty dean at the university.\n\nIBM's client engineering team worked alongside the faculty to build a model using IBM AI platforms to analyse and interpret doctors' notes, recommend treatment pathways, and automatically handle laboratory orders.\n\nAI can suggest pathology laboratory tests based on a patient's medical record and trends, and doctors can then verify the suggestions.\n\nOnce approved by doctors, the AI automates the lab orders and schedules the patient's follow-up appointments, alleviating the workload for both doctors and nurses, said Dr Bannakij.\n\nThe collaboration complemented the hospital's recent implementation of a fully automated medical laboratory system.\n\nBuilt on transparent, reliable data and global AI governance standards, this initiative was meant to improve service efficiency and support medical decision-making with accurate and comprehensive insights, enhancing treatment quality and speed, according to IBM.\n\nThe project eases high-volume workloads, reducing the time spent in the lab order process and on scheduling patient appointments. As a result, it cuts the time spent by patients in medical check-ups at the hospital by 30-40 minutes, down from the current 150 minutes, he said.\n\nThe hospital has around 1.6 million patients a year. For the project, physicians also help to train the AI system.\n\n\"This milestone highlights our vision to lead in service excellence, treatment and research -- not just in Chiang Mai or Thailand, but across Southeast Asia,\" said Dr Bannakij.\n\nDr Krit Khwanngern, deputy dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Chiang Mai University, said the system does not store patients' real names, instead anonymising them to protect sensitive data and comply with the Personal Data Protection Act.\n\nIn the future, the hospital will analyse patient medical check-up data and use it to offer preventive healthcare services on a more personalised basis, said Dr Krit.\n\n\"Agentic AI is leveraged with the digital improvements we've invested in over the past few years by integrating different systems from physicians, nurses, pharmacies, and electronic medical records for both inpatient and outpatient care. This provides a strong data infrastructure on the back end, which leads to improved services on the front end,\" he said.\n\n\"We also invested 300 million baht in cybersecurity to ensure strong capabilities to secure sensitive data.\"\n\nThe project was successful because of the ability of the hospital's in-house teams to work together with external tech experts, while its physicians have technical knowledge that can design systems to serve users' needs, said Dr Krit.\n\nThe hospital continues to adopt advanced technologies, he said.\n\nThe faculty piloted IBM's AutoAI to support the development of patient service apps, enabling data scientists to write code more efficiently and reduce development time for future apps that will enhance patient treatment and services, said Dr Krit.\n\nMany executives note that humans will still be required to operate AI in a responsible manner.\n\nAgentic AI in banking\n\n\"2025 will be the year of agentic AI and we've been working on responsible agentic AI since the beginning of this year,\" said Ruangroj Poonpol, chairman of Kasikorn Business-Technology Group (KBTG), the technology arm of Kasikornbank.\n\nAgentic AI will be an essential tool for KBTG to accelerate its organisational transformation, he said. An AI agent can perceive, make decisions, take action and achieve goals in its own environment.\n\n\"It's a digital workforce without the need of a vacation, providing even more productivity uplift than before. We need to upskill, reskill, and learn how to use it and when to use it,\" said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nIn 2025, KBTG will focus on fostering collaboration between humans and AI, while ensuring a human-centric approach, he said. With human-AI convergence for value creation, KBTG's performance will be faster and more productive than ever, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nHe said this focus will be driven by a few elements, including the use of new platforms to efficiently manage AI agents, enabling seamless collaboration with human workers.\n\nOne of the platforms is AthenaMind, an internal tool designed as an AI agent creation hub, or \"AI agent factory\", for building AI agents for various applications.\n\nAnother element is an agentic orchestration, involving the design of new operational workflows to enable AI agents and humans to work together more effectively and drive business outcomes.\n\nFor example, KBTG introduced an AI coding assistant to improve software development, reducing software developers' working hours by 20%. So far, more than 500,000 lines of code have been generated using AI.\n\nThe next step is to evolve this AI assistant into a fully functional AI coding agent, capable of independently writing code from start to finish based on clear requirements, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nKBTG equips its employees with the right mindset, skills, and an open work culture to integrate AI into their daily tasks, he said. The company achieved 100% AI literacy, ensuring all employees are knowledgeable and prepared to work alongside AI technology in their roles.\n\nKBTG wants this human-AI convergence project to generate more than 10 billion baht in business impact by 2029, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nRetail uses\n\nAxel Winter, chief executive of Xponential, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform and innovation consultancy, said the opportunities for AI agents are vast in the retail sector.\n\n\"For example, agents could dynamically create promotions based on real-time data such as customer sentiment, inventory levels and sales trends,\" he said.\n\nThey can also generate and deploy marketing campaigns across various channels, which are particularly relevant in the fast-paced Southeast Asian e-commerce landscape.\n\n\"It's important to recognise not all AI technologies being promoted are fully mature, and the field is in constant flux. It is vital to remain flexible, keep a close eye on both established vendors and the open-source community, and be prepared to adapt and innovate rapidly,\" said Mr Winter.\n\nWidespread in 2026\n\nPhiphat Prapapanpong, director of advanced insights at Bluebik Group, a SET-listed tech consulting firm, said the adoption of AI-driven agentic workflows, which leverage GenAI capabilities with business processes, will emerge as a key trend in AI development.\n\n\"This year marks the beginning of the agentic AI era, with large enterprises -- particularly banks, insurance companies and retailers -- starting to pilot its use internally,\" he said.\n\nBy next year, Mr Phiphat said he expects agentic AI to become more widespread and transition into full deployment.\n\nHe said organisations piloting agentic AI aim to enhance employee productivity without additional hiring. For example, procurement processes can use agentic AI to seek better prices and sourcing.\n\nJob losses and opportunities\n\nPanutat Tejasen, a pioneer in AI development, said the adoption of agentic AI is accelerating because it can integrate with business workflows, delivering tangible results for return on investment.\n\nHe said many jobs will be replaced as agentic AI takes over tasks. For example, roles in customer service, procurement and data entry are likely to be automated.\n\n\"You will see machine agents communicating with other machines. A procurement agent, for example, will negotiate with a sales agent, with less human involvement,\" said Mr Panutat.\n\nHe said agentic AI will also open up new opportunities in software development.\n\nThanachart Numnonda, executive director of IMC Institute, a tech research and training firm, said agentic AI is still being used for specific and small-scale tasks.\n\n\"This opens up new opportunities for developers to build agentic AI services tailored for businesses,\" he said.\n\nMr Thanachart said he does not think agentic AI will make the SaaS business obsolete, as it still requires software as its foundation.\n\n\"Humans are still in the loop and work alongside AI,\" he said."

            "article_content": "Yet, over the past years, we\u2019ve seen the emergence of a confluence of factors (including sourcing from automated, AI-generated social media trawls and strongly politicized information collection), which will inevitably create a distortion in conflict data. And it will have a detrimental effect on what people will come to know about conflict, how we respond to or engage with threats and risks, whose security we value and whose human rights we uphold.\n\nAs conflict rates continue to rise, we need accurate, reliable and good-faith evidence to stem the tide.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent decision to stop independent fact-checking on Facebook and Threads, starting in the U.S., is a culmination of all this. Of course, it\u2019s not like Facebook\u2019s fact-checking was holding back the wave of misinformation \u2014 and the decision to move away from often highly politicized decisions does have merit. However, this comes at a moment when we\u2019re experiencing a decrease in the quality and quantity of accurate information; public consciousness is against expertise that challenges preconceived ideas; and both public and private information flows prioritize fast data \u2014 regardless of quality.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly an audience for fast information: Most young people get their news through brief, visual messages \u2014 if they get any at all. And in order to grab attention in this ecosystem, conflict news often pushes extremely unreliable death tolls or blame narratives that are simplistic and skewed, resulting in a conflict news cycle that is both brutal and perversely entertaining.\n\nThere\u2019s also little pushback against highly exaggerated and unproven fatality counts that are put out to emphasize the depth of destruction. The number of people killed in conflict is extremely difficult to measure accurately \u2014 even when that conflict is extensively covered, like the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. In cases of largely forgotten conflicts, like that in Sudan, who is going to check whether it was actually 100,000 or 150,000 people who were killed? (In reality, both these numbers are exaggerations, yet both appeared in print in major publications this week.)\n\nWho checks these figures? My team and I do."

            "article_content": "I stopped buying most games for my Nintendo Switch the day I bought a Steam Deck. My Switch has been a Mario and Zelda machine ever since. It\u2019s simple: the Steam Deck took the Switch\u2019s best trick \u2014 pick-up-and-play portability \u2014 while offering more games that run better. I can easily resume the ones I started on my desktop PC, or continue to play portable titles on my desktop and marvel at improved graphics.\n\nBut the Nintendo Switch 2, coming later this year, may change that value proposition. Not only will it continue to be the console that attracts families and kids with inventive, surprising, must-try exclusive Nintendo games that use its detachable Joy-Cons\u2019 many tricks, but it also has a real chance at convincing the enthusiasts who might otherwise buy a handheld gaming PC \u2014 or who were waiting for handheld PCs to become less of a wild west.\n\nThe Switch 2\u2019s newly magnetic Joy-Con. Gif: Nintendo\n\nThe Switch 2 may meet or beat the Steam Deck in performance. If history\u2019s any indication, it should easily sell better than every handheld gaming PC combined. When the original Nintendo Switch launched nearly eight years ago, there was almost nothing to play but Zelda, and Nintendo held its game catalog in an iron grip \u2014 but now, the backwards-compatible Switch 2 will launch with one of the largest and most welcoming libraries of all time, rivaled only by smartphones and computers. The Switch could theoretically become the new baseline for game developers to target, and the most reliable place to find new handheld-friendly titles.\n\nSo: How can the budding handheld PC revolution escape the shadow of the Switch 2? I won\u2019t say I know for sure, but I did just check the industry\u2019s temperature at CES 2025, the world\u2019s biggest tech show \u2014 and I\u2019m afraid PC handhelds may stay in that shadow unless the industry does more.\n\nHandheld ergonomics was one bright spot going into 2025. While I still prefer the Deck\u2019s overall feel, practically every PC handheld I touched had nicely sculpted grips that made them more comfortable to hold than their predecessors. From the 8-inch MSI Claw 8 AI Plus and Lenovo Legion Go S, to the 8.8-inch Legion Go 2, and the giant 11-inch Tencent Sunday Dragon, even the largest Windows handhelds didn\u2019t feel as awkward as some of their first-gen predecessors.\n\nThere are four places I think the industry has to change \u2014 and maybe, band together \u2014 if these handhelds want a meaningful piece of the Switch.\n\nA year made a huge ergonomic difference to Lenovo\u2019s handhelds in particular. (The new one\u2019s on the left.) Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto\n\nOperating system\n\nBuyers need to know that their game will be ready to play when they press the power button on a handheld. That\u2019s the Nintendo Switch experience, and it\u2019s similar to how the Steam Deck works once games are downloaded \u2014 but it\u2019s far from what Windows handhelds currently offer.\n\nThat\u2019s why the three biggest pieces of handheld gaming news at the show had little to do with the hardware itself. They were about ditching today\u2019s version of handheld Windows.\n\nFirst, Lenovo revealed it would produce the first authorized third-party handheld to ship with Valve\u2019s easy-to-use SteamOS instead of Windows \u2014 something only the Steam Deck has done so far. Second, Valve told us it would bring a SteamOS beta to additional third-party handhelds as soon as this April. Third, a Microsoft executive told The Verge that the company would finally do something meaningful about its bloated Windows experience on handhelds later this year, combining \u201cthe best of Xbox and Windows together.\u201d\n\nThese moves are heartening, as it\u2019s a Wild West in handheld PC land. Most companies opt for a copy of Windows that doesn\u2019t reliably launch games or sleep and wake properly, defeating some of the purpose of a pick-up-and-play handheld experience. They\u2019re filled with difficult-to-navigate UI and unnecessary bloatware, too \u2014 to the point that today, a community-created fork of Valve\u2019s SteamOS UI is already a far better experience than Windows.\n\nIt\u2019s also good for SteamOS fans: while the Steam Deck is a great platform for SteamOS, we\u2019ve already seen the Deck can\u2019t compete with the Switch by itself. Game publishers don\u2019t see the raw sales numbers to bring big multiplayer games like Fortnite or Valorant to SteamOS. (They say cheaters are too big a risk.)\n\nBut, while the CES moves are significant, Valve, Microsoft, and Lenovo are non-committal about how much things might improve. Microsoft would only give me the barest hints about making Windows feel more like an Xbox game console at some point later this year. Lenovo is hedging its SteamOS bet hard \u2014 not only will the Legion Go S ship in both Windows and SteamOS varieties, the Windows version will go on sale months earlier, and Lenovo won\u2019t commit to SteamOS for its larger, later-in-2025 handheld.\n\nNo other company announced a SteamOS handheld at CES, either, save for PC maker GPD, with a claim that was apparently false or lost in translation. Valve told me it has no other partner devices currently in the works for SteamOS, though it\u2019d be happy to work with more companies. I believe every handheld maker should give SteamOS a shot.\n\nCES 2025 brought huge handhelds like this 11-inch Acer, and they\u2019re not necessarily a bad idea! Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nScreen\n\nThis one\u2019s easy: to maximize performance, battery life, economies of scale, and offer a closer-to-game-console experience, handheld PC makers should universally adopt a 1080p-or-lower-resolution HDR OLED screen with variable refresh rate.\n\nMany PC manufacturers are wasting what little performance they can muster from a handheld chip and battery on a screen with far too many pixels for the task, artificially constraining performance and battery life in exchange for 1600p or 1200p sharpness that most gamers won\u2019t miss on a 7-inch to 8-inch panel. Additionally, every handheld without a variable refresh rate screen is likely wasting a good chunk of the frames that their handheld can serve because their screen is artificially limiting their framerate \u2014 VRR was the Asus ROG Ally\u2019s secret weapon, letting it play games more smoothly than competing handhelds even if rivals\u2019 chips offered the same FPS.\n\nLastly, HDR is a revelation on the Steam Deck OLED\u2019s screen, letting both native titles and the HDR games I stream from my PS5 feel like they\u2019re filled with real light that explodes out of the screen. It\u2019s something Windows desktops and laptops have never consistently offered the way today\u2019s consoles do, but handhelds could be the gateway to changing that.\n\nIs a screen like the one I\u2019m describing expensive or hard to find? Band together, PC companies, and surely a display maker can change that for you.\n\nChips and battery\n\nUnless you count the Nvidia Tegra at the heart of the Nintendo Switch, AMD is the leader in handheld chips. But its semi-custom Aerith and Sephiroth parts for the Steam Deck feel like the only ones proactively designed with power-sipping handhelds in mind, leaving everyone else at a portability disadvantage. And it sounds like AMD\u2019s new Z2 line might not be all that different.\n\nAMD\u2019s Z1 batch of chips in handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally wasn\u2019t originally for handheld; they\u2019re mildly tweaked laptop processors that need 17 or 18 watts to begin to hit their stride, enough for a complete handheld to drain a typical 50Wh battery pack in well under three hours with mildly intensive games.\n\nThe Z2 line is similarly a set of tweaked laptop chips, and while AMD told me some may offer more performance at the same power and add improved efficiency tweaks, the total consumed power may not decrease. Lenovo product manager Alex Zhu told me it\u2019s looking at running its Legion Go S\u2019s Z2 Go chip at around 20 watts, which might give it worse battery life than the 15-watt-and-below Steam Deck even if its GPU is more capable. AMD also confirmed the Z2 Go is less powerful than the prior-gen Z1 Extreme.\n\nAMD senior fellow Mahesh Subramony told me the company\u2019s flagship Z2 Extreme chip, on TSMC\u2019s shrunk-down N4P process node with a mix of newer Zen 5, Zen 5c and RDNA 3.5 cores, should be both more efficient and much more capable than the Z2 Go, and quite a bit better than the Z1 Extreme as well, but it\u2019s not a leap forward. That may require AMD\u2019s even newer RDNA 4 graphics, and it may require bespoke processors.\n\nThe MSI Claw 8 AI Plus uses an Intel Lunar Lake chip. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nDon\u2019t hold your breath if you\u2019re hoping Intel might provide meaningful competition in the handheld chip realm. While early reviews of the Intel Lunar Lake chip in the revised MSI Claw 8 AI Plus are quite promising, its pricey Lunar Lake chip may be a bit of a one-off, with future Intel parts steering away from the power-saving on-die memory that Intel experimentally added. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s why MSI hasn\u2019t fully launched the Claw as expected.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel certainly has bigger fish to fry right now than making custom handheld chips. \u201cIt\u2019s not a market that we\u2019re actively pursuing, but it\u2019s a market we\u2019re happy to enable,\u201d Intel VP of technical marketing Robert Hallock tells me of handheld gaming. \u201cIt is somewhat extracurricular,\u201d he added, explaining that it\u2019s a fun and exciting but small market and that Intel has to pick its battles. \u201cWe\u2019re coming off admittedly, about five, six years of strife and we have to decide where we want to invest.\u201d.\n\nSome manufacturers have been able to improve the battery life disadvantage of today\u2019s off-the-shelf AMD chips by including a much larger battery pack \u2014 the Asus ROG Ally X doubled the size of its predecessor\u2019s pack to 80 watt-hours, and it\u2019s no longer the only 80Wh handheld you can buy. But that comes with size and weight tradeoffs that can only be partially engineered away.\n\nWe need handheld makers to join together and make a case for better chips.\n\nThe Steam Deck still starts at $399, even if the $529 OLED model is superior. Photo by The Verge\n\nPrice\n\nThe PC industry also needs to cut prices if it wants a chance to eat Nintendo\u2019s lunch.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch debuted at $299 in 2017 \u2014 around $380 in today\u2019s money \u2014 and the OLED version arrived at $349 in 2021. A year later, Valve\u2019s Steam Deck debuted at $399. But today, the only Windows handheld gaming PC I can recommend costs $799, roughly twice the price of an entry-level Deck, and most Windows handhelds have started at $600 and up. High-end options are great, but the space may remain niche without low-end options, too.\n\nOnly the least expensive model of Lenovo\u2019s SteamOS variant of the Legion Go S will lower that bar to $499 this May. And all of those prices are still more than Sony or Microsoft charges for a TV console with far more performance, and likely more than Nintendo will charge for the Switch 2.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what exactly PC makers would need to do to challenge the Switch on price, but it\u2019s likely not simple. Valve CEO Gabe Newell said it was \u201cpainful\u201d but \u201ccritical\u201d to launch the Steam Deck at $399, hinting that the company may have followed the razor-and-blades business model where console makers initially sell hardware at a loss, then make the money back as people buy games. If so, that\u2019s a tough act to follow, as no other PC maker controls the world\u2019s largest PC games store and can afford to subsidize a handheld that way.\n\nBut not every console has been a loss leader: Nintendo reportedly never sold the Switch at a loss, and Sony stopped selling the PS5 at a loss less than a year after its debut. So it\u2019s possible to cut prices with the right bill of materials and economies of scale. Lenovo explicitly told me it worked with AMD on the Z2 Go chip to help lower the Legion Go S\u2019s price, for example.\n\nTo compete with Nintendo, a company like Microsoft or Valve or even Sony needs to lead the charge, securing the components and offering the right operating system for dozens of true Switch competitors Imagine dozens of portable Xboxes or PlayStations or Steam Machines, instead of each PC maker marching to the beat of their own drum."

This movement enables users to repair and upgrade their machines without being penalized by technology companies through restrictions on getting components or tools to make the repairs.\n\nWhile modular laptop concepts aren't new \u2014 Framework has been making modular laptops for years, and Asus will soon release ROG Strix Scar 16 and 18 laptops \u2014 this new approach from Intel has one key differentiator: It's open source, meaning anyone can use the research materials to make their own laptops and PCs.\n\nWhat is Intel's Modular PC paper about?\n\nIntel's proposed modular motherboard and IO ports in laptops with fan-less, single-fan, and dual-fan designs. | Credit: Intel\n\nIntel's modular design would separate the existing laptop motherboard from an all-in-one solution into a three-segment design with the motherboard and SoC (system-on-a-chip) separate from the IO ports. This would allow for an easier repair and upgrade process.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This innovative structure allows for targeted upgrades, repairs, and replacements, significantly extending the device's lifespan and reducing electronic waste.\"\n\nIntel's proposal reads, in part, \"Modular PC architecture breaks from the traditional all-in-one motherboard design, opting instead for a system where key components are categorized into individual, interchangeable modules.\n\nThis innovative structure allows for targeted upgrades, repairs, and replacements, significantly extending the device's lifespan and reducing electronic waste.\"\n\nIntel also proposed a modular mini-PC design, separating the components into standardized modules, similar to the proposed laptop design.\n\nAs the Intel blog purports, the purpose of all this is to \"significantly extend the usable life of computing devices, thereby reducing electronic waste and promoting a more sustainable consumption model.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"By working closely with our customers and partners, we hope to transform the way PCs are designed and help shape the future of computing.\"\n\nWhat makes Intel's proposal different from existing modular laptops like Framework?\n\nCredit: Framework\n\nFor the last couple of generations of Framework designs, like the Framework Laptop 16 in 2023, the company has even created swappable motherboards and replaceable displays to repair or upgrade the laptop.\n\nHowever, Framework is just one company. Intel's design plan attempts to open-source modular laptop and mini-PC designs.\n\nThe pro proposal is more like the desktop format approach. In contrast, PC-building enthusiasts can choose parts from different manufacturers and put them in the same PC thanks to format standardizations like ATX, DTX, Micro ATX, and Mini ITX.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntel pioneered the ATX and Micro ATX motherboard and power supply formats. However, companies like IBM, SSI, VIA, and AMD created many standardized motherboard form factors.\n\nWhen could we see modular laptops and mini PCs take over?\n\nIn contrast to other modular laptop implementations, Intel's proposal is more of an open-source solution. Intel doesn't manufacture devices, just some PC components. So this design would need to be adopted by Intel's laptop and mini-PC partners.\n\nThat means it could be a while before we see manufacturers like Dell, Asus, or Lenovo utilizing Intel's modular motherboard and I/O designs to create modular laptops and mini-PCs.\n\nConsidering the time it takes to engineer and build new laptops and mini-PCs, the earliest we could expect to see parts of this modular concept would be about a year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGiven Intel Co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus's confirmation at CES that \"Panther Lake\" is already in testing, we might see modular laptops and mini-PCs built with a mobile variant of that SoC. But only time will tell."

            "article_content": "Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities made a number of prescient calls last year. Perhaps most impressive was his prediction that the Nasdaq Composite would reach 20,000 in 2024 as the artificial intelligence boom drove technology stocks higher. Ives remains bullish in 2025.\n\nThe first three industrial revolutions were driven by technological innovations in steam power, electricity, and microprocessors, and Ives sees AI as the driving force behind the fourth industrial revolution. Investment opportunities of that magnitude come along maybe once in a decade, perhaps even less often.\n\nImportantly, during a recent Bloomberg interview, Ives selected Nvidia (NVDA -3.12%) as his top stock pick for 2025 due to the company's central role in the artificial intelligence economy. Read on to learn more.\n\nNvidia is the reason modern artificial intelligence is possible\n\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center tasks like training large language models and running artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Analysts estimate the chipmaker has between 70% and 95% market share in AI accelerators. And Forrester Research says, \"Without Nvidia's GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nIn a recent note, Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley wrote, \"The market tends to underestimate the difficulty of competing with Nvidia.\" Indeed, analysts generally expect the company to maintain its dominance for at least two to three years. One reason for that confidence is Nvidia's CUDA platform, a robust ecosystem of code libraries and pretrained models that simplifies the development of AI applications.\n\nAnother reason for that confidence is the company's full-stack approach to accelerated computing. Nvidia is best known for GPUs, but its product portfolio also includes central processing units (CPUs), interconnects, and networking equipment. That vertical integration lets the company build systems with a superior total cost of ownership, according to CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nChristopher Rolland at Susquehanna recently wrote, \"Nvidia has become the world's de facto enabler of AI.\" He attributed that success to vertical integration spanning chips, adjacent data center hardware, and software. Overcoming that advantage is more complicated than developing better accelerators. Instead, competitors would need an entire ecosystem of hardware and software comparable to what Nvidia offers.\n\nIves says the artificial intelligence revolution is entering a new phase\n\nDan Ives recently wrote on X (the platform previously known as Twitter), \"The AI revolution is entering a new stage of growth and Nvidia and Jensen continue to be the foundation for this 4th industrial revolution.\" Also, in a recent CNBC interview, Ives identified two catalysts that could send Nvidia shares higher: the Blackwell GPU and physical AI.\n\nBlackwell is Nvidia's next-generation GPU architecture. Compared to the previous Hopper generation, Blackwell can complete AI training tasks up to four times faster and AI inference tasks up to 30 times faster. Production of Blackwell started to ramp up in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, which ends in January 2025, so Nvidia should see substantial revenue from the new chip this year.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang believes, \"The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history.\" He also told attendees at the 2025 CES, \"The next wave of AI is here. Robotics powered by physical AI will revolutionize industries.\"\n\nIves believes Nvidia has a $1 trillion opportunity in physical AI as self-driving cars and robotics become sizable markets in the next decade. Importantly, Nvidia has already positioned itself to be a long-term winner. Like its strategy with generative AI, the company has a full-stack computing solution for autonomous robots spanning data center infrastructure, software development tools, and embedded processors.\n\nNvidia stock trades at a surprisingly reasonable valuation\n\nDan Ives is not alone in selecting Nvidia as a top stock pick for 2025. Harsh Kumar at Piper Sandler recently wrote, \"We are making Nvidia our top large-cap pick given the company's dominant position in AI accelerators and the upcoming launch of the Blackwell architecture.\"\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase by 39% annually through fiscal 2027, which ends in January 2027. That makes the current valuation of 55 times adjusted earnings look very reasonable. But Ives believes that the consensus figure underestimates earnings by as much as 30% over the next few years.\n\nWhether he is correct or not, investors with a time horizon of three to five years should feel comfortable buying a small position in Nvidia today. However, investors should not limit themselves to a single \"best\" AI stock. It would be more prudent to build a basket of AI stocks that cover different areas of the AI economy, such as data center infrastructure, cloud services, and software."

Rogan's breakdown comes around a month after the tragic passing of a scientist researching the case.\n\nIn 2024, a New York Post report addressed the three-fingered humanoid alien mummies investigated in Peru in 2023. Speaking to the Daily Mail, American attorney Joshua McDowell, who'd claimed to have investigated the humanoids with an independent forensic team, asserted that the humanoids' fingerprints were \"straight\" unlike those of humans.\n\nThe Post alluded that Mexican journalist, Jose Jaime Maussan, presented some alleged mummified alien remains in front of Mexico's Congress back in 2023.\n\nMoreover, Dr. Edgar Hernandez published two research papers on the tridactyls, including the alleged alien mummy 'Maria.'

Therein, experts suggested that the much-discussed humanoid remains, supposedly from Peru's Nazca region and of entities that were tridactyls (with three fingers), were humanoid dolls made by sticking together human and animal remains.\n\nJoe Rogan cited the 2024 New York Post report and alluded to the inbuilt three-finger structure, non-human fingerprint pattern (straight lines not spirals), and the indications that the humanoid referred to as 'Maria' might indeed be an extraterrestrial:\n\n\"They had a cranial capacity that is larger than most human beings ... It looks like a f*cking alien. But is that real? ... Look at that picture, what it actually looks like. That's f*cking crazy. That [Maria] does look like an alien.\"\n\nRogan emphasized how eerily similar it was to the archetype of the 'Greys' aka 'Grey aliens,' an oft-utilized alien representation in pop culture. It entails that an alien/ET is generally a grey-colored entity with a small hairless body, enlarged head, and large peculiar black eyes:\n\n\"What is that? If it's got three fingers and three toes, and it's got an alien face -- it looks like a 'Grey' [Grey alien]. It has a tiny slot for a mouth and tiny dots for a nose. It looks like the archetypal angel, or the archetypal alien rather, that people see in the [movie] 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'

Many ufologists and ET/alien lifeform enthusiasts have often accused the U.S. government as well as other countries' governments of concealing alien remains and technologies from the general populace.\n\nBack in Feb. 2023, the American government shot down a few objects that some believed were Chinese spy balloons. The government had implied that the objects weren't ETs/ET-related technology. Nevertheless, Joe Rogan took to Instagram and jestingly reaffirmed his stance that the government was probably concealing alien-related knowledge. He wrote:\n\n\"Now all of a sudden I think it actually is aliens. #lookintoit\"\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

The Daily compiled a recap of their latest research developments.\n\nTracking a fast radio burst to an unlikely galaxy for the first time\n\nIn collaboration with colleagues at McGill University, NU researchers located and tracked a fast radio burst to an inactive galaxy two billion light-years away. The finding further complicates the mystery of these short-duration radio wave emissions by contrasting prevailing theories that FRBs originate in galaxies with active star formations, according to a news release.\n\nThe group of researchers first identified this specific FRB last February using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment radio telescope.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another mystery of the universe that I\u2019d like to explore,\u201d said Tarraneh Eftekhari, a NASA Hubble Einstein Fellow and researcher. \u201cIt was really, really surprising and also exciting to see.\u201d\n\nAs additional, smaller versions of CHIME \u2014 known as outrigger telescopes \u2014 come online, researchers believe they can localize the FRBs with finer precision, according to Eftekhari.\n\n\u201cIn the not too distant future, I think we\u2019ll revolutionize the field, so I\u2019m very excited for that,\u201d Eftekhari said.\n\nImproving the quality of perovskite solar cells\n\nNU researchers discovered a new method to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells, or solar cells with a crystal structure. The team, led by chemistry Prof. Ted Sargent, published its findings Jan. 9 in the academic journal Joule, according to a news release.\n\nPSCs offer a potential alternative to costly, silicon-based solar panels, chemistry Prof. Bin Chen said in an interview with The Daily.\n\n\u201cThere are many emerging technologies, and perovskites promise to deliver higher efficiency solar panels, meaning lower costs,\u201d Chen said.\n\nCompared to the silicon-based solar panels that currently dominate the market, PSCs weigh less, allowing for reduced installation costs, according to Chen.\n\nDuring production, PSCs also require one-eighth of the heat energy of silicon ingots, further decreasing environmental and monetary costs, according to Chen.\n\nChen said the study is part of a larger effort to investigate the reliability and durability of PSCs as researchers look for clean energy alternatives to power the future.\n\n\u201cWe see a really big global community driving toward the same goal, which is to make perovskites and solar cells better,\u201d Chen said.\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n\u2014 Research Roundup: AI in maternal health, quantum teleportation, developments in Parkinson\u2019s genetic research\n\n\u2014 CIERA facilitates interdisciplinary research in astrophysics\n\n\u2014 Northwestern Researchers look into SuperAgers at the Mesulam Center"

            "article_content": "Have you ever wondered how certain problems are so complex that even the fastest computers struggle to solve them? These types of problems are often found in industries like transportation, finance, healthcare, and science. They\u2019re called \u201coptimization problems,\u201d where the goal is to find the best solution out of many possible options.\n\nWhile regular computers (called \u201cclassical computers\u201c) are great for many tasks, they can have a hard time handling these massive challenges. Enter quantum computers.\n\nQuantum computers are an exciting new kind of technology that could change the way we solve difficult problems, especially Quantum Computing Problems. Instead of using regular computer bits (which are like tiny on/off switches), quantum computers use something called \u201cquantum bits,\u201d or qubits.\n\nQubits are super special because they follow the rules of quantum physics, which means they can process information in ways that classical computers can\u2019t. This makes quantum computers much more powerful at solving certain types of puzzles.\n\nWhat Are Optimization Problems?\n\nOptimization problems sound fancy, but you deal with them every day without even realizing it. Imagine you\u2019re trying to pick the fastest route to school on a map, or you\u2019re deciding how to spend your pocket money to get the best value. These are simple examples of optimization problems\u2014finding the best option out of many choices.\n\nNow imagine you work at an airport and have to decide the best way to schedule hundreds of flights, manage thousands of bags, and make everything run smoothly without delays. Or maybe you work for a delivery company and you want to find the most efficient way to deliver millions of packages across the country. These problems are way too complicated to solve with just guesswork!\n\nRegular computers try to solve these tough problems by testing every possible solution one by one, which can take an enormous amount of time. Even supercomputers may need days, months, or even years to do the job, depending on how big the problem is.\n\nWhat Makes Quantum Computers Different?\n\nQuantum computers are special because they use principles from quantum mechanics, a branch of science that studies the tiniest building blocks of our universe\u2014like atoms and particles. Unlike classical computers, which use bits that can be either 0 or 1, qubits can be in multiple states at once, thanks to something called \u201csuperposition.\u201d This allows quantum computers to look at many possible solutions simultaneously, instead of one by one.\n\nQuantum computers also use something called \u201centanglement,\u201d where qubits are connected in a way that lets them share information instantly. These features allow quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\n\nFor optimization problems, this means quantum computers can solve puzzles with millions (or even billions!) of possibilities in a fraction of the time it would take a classical computer.\n\nThis breakthrough is particularly exciting for industries like logistics, where the rise of technology has revolutionized traditional operations. If you interested in exploring this further, can check out our blog, \u201cF2000s and the Rise of Technology in Logistics,\u201d to learn how advanced computing and innovation are shaping supply chains globally.\n\nReal-Life Benefits of Quantum Computing in Optimization\n\nNow that we understand how quantum computers work, let\u2019s explore some real-life benefits for solving optimization problems.\n\n1. Faster Deliveries and Better Logistics\n\nHave you ever ordered something online and tracked its delivery route? Companies like Amazon or FedEx need to figure out the fastest and cheapest way to deliver packages to millions of customers. Using quantum computers, these companies could create better delivery plans in real time, saving money and ensuring you get your package as quickly as possible.\n\n2. Smarter Traffic Management\n\nTraffic jams are another optimization challenge. Cities around the world face growing traffic problems as more and more cars hit the roads. Quantum computing can help plan better traffic flows, reduce congestion, and make public transportation more efficient. This could save time, lower fuel usage, and reduce pollution!\n\n3. Improved Healthcare Scheduling\n\nHospitals deal with optimization problems all the time, like scheduling surgeries, assigning doctors, and managing beds for patients. Quantum computers could help hospitals make better schedules that improve patient care and reduce waiting times. This means more lives saved and a smoother healthcare experience.\n\n4. More Accurate Financial Predictions\n\nBanks and investment companies often deal with risky decisions, like where to invest money or how to predict market changes. These are complex optimization problems that involve analyzing a huge amount of data. Quantum computers could help make faster and smarter financial decisions, which could stabilize markets and improve the global economy.\n\n5. Advancing Science and Research\n\nFrom designing new medicines to improving renewable energy systems, scientists rely on optimization to solve tough problems. Quantum computers can speed up this research and bring us closer to breakthroughs in important areas like curing diseases or fighting climate change.\n\nChallenges and the Future of Quantum Computing\n\nQuantum computers sound amazing, but they\u2019re not perfect yet. Building and maintaining them is incredibly hard. They need to be kept in extremely cold environments and are still in the early stages of development. Right now, only a few companies and research labs have working quantum computers.\n\nStill, progress is happening quickly. Scientists and engineers are working hard to make quantum computers more powerful and accessible. Many believe that within the next 10 to 20 years, we\u2019ll see quantum computing become a common tool for solving real-world problems.\n\nWhy Should You Care About Quantum Computing?\n\nEven if you\u2019re not a scientist or an engineer, quantum computing is something exciting to keep an eye on. The benefits it could bring, from better technologies to smarter ways of solving problems, have the potential to impact nearly every part of our lives. Quantum computing could lead to a better, more efficient, and more sustainable future.\n\nThink of quantum computers like the superheroes of the technology world. They take on the toughest challenges and uncover solutions that normal computers just can\u2019t handle. And who knows? Maybe one day you\u2019ll be working on quantum computing or benefiting from its amazing advancements!\n\nQuantum computing may still sound like science fiction to some, but it\u2019s quickly becoming a reality. Its ability to solve advanced optimization problems could transform industries and improve the world in countless ways.\n\nThe possibilities are limitless, and we\u2019re just getting started!

            "article_content": "\u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\u201d by Yuval Noah Harari is a sweeping and insightful exploration of our species\u2019 journey from its humble beginnings to the present day.\n\nSapiens explores the rise of Homo sapiens through key revolutions: the Cognitive Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, and the Scientific Revolution. This groundbreaking book examines how human history is shaped by \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies \u2013 that enable unparalleled cooperation. Harari investigates the impact of these revolutions on human society, from the dawn of agriculture and the rise of civilizations to the challenges of the modern world, including climate change, technological disruption, and the search for meaning in the 21st century.\n\nThe Cognitive Revolution: The book begins by examining the unique cognitive abilities that set Homo sapiens apart from other animals. Around 70,000 years ago, a \u201cCognitive Revolution\u201d occurred, leading to the development of advanced language and the ability to create and believe in \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies. These shared fictions, while not objectively real, allow humans to cooperate flexibly on a massive scale, a feat unparalleled in the animal kingdom. This cooperation enabled the development of complex social structures, from small tribes to vast empires.\n\nThe Agricultural Revolution: Around 12,000 years ago, humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agriculture. This seemingly revolutionary shift, however, brought about significant drawbacks. Agriculture led to increased inequality, disease, and environmental degradation. Farmers, despite working harder than hunter-gatherers, often had less leisure time and a poorer diet. The domestication of plants and animals also led to the suffering of countless creatures.\n\nThe Scientific Revolution: Beginning in the 16th century, the Scientific Revolution challenged religious dogma and ushered in an era of unprecedented technological and social change. Science provided humans with new tools and knowledge, allowing them to manipulate the natural world on an unprecedented scale. This revolution, however, also brought about new challenges, such as climate change, nuclear war, and the potential for technological disruption.\n\nModern Challenges: Harari explores the profound challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. These include climate change, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. He raises critical questions about the meaning of happiness, the future of humanity, and our relationship with technology.\n\nKey Themes:"

Krishnan, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of Indiasaid: \"To enable this growth and become a global tech powerhouse, we need collaboration from all stakeholders to leverage Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies for critical challenges on health, education, smart cities and agriculture. AI for India 2030 is an important initiative in partnership with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, enabling stakeholders across industry and start-ups to partner with the government to realize the potential of AI.\"\n\nAI's ability to develop context-specific solutions provides India with a unique opportunity to address its diverse challenges while contributing to global AI governance and ethics.\n\nAjay Kumar Sood, Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, remarked: \"Our association with the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution India is driving forward innovative solutions that address key challenges in healthcare, education, urban development and agriculture through the power of advanced technologies.\"\n\nBuilding foundations for scalable AI solutions\n\nThe success of AI in India depends on the collaboration of multiple stakeholders, including government bodies, industry leaders, academia and startups. Public-private partnerships are essential to accelerate AI adoption, while regional initiatives such as AI centres of excellence provide localized ecosystems for innovation.\n\nIndia\u2019s digital public infrastructure (DPI) serves as a critical enabler for scaling artificial intelligence applications. By integrating AI capabilities into existing DPI systems, India can overcome traditional barriers to adoption and create a robust foundation for deploying AI solutions across sectors. As one council member noted: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a separate DPI for AI; rather, we need our DPI to power AI.\u201d\n\nTo support these efforts, resource allocation remains key. This includes both financial investments and the creation of sector-specific AI operating systems that integrate data, models and infrastructure.\n\nThese systems will enable seamless collaboration across industries such as agriculture, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and healthcare, fostering scaleable and impactful AI solutions. \"India\u2019s DPI provides a key head start in driving scale among AI use cases,\" noted a council member, highlighting its transformative role.\n\nAI Playbook and Sandbox workstreams as catalysts for change\n\nThe AI for India 2030 initiative is driven by two critical workstreams: the AI Playbook and the AI Sandbox, both designed to operationalize AI adoption and innovation in priority sectors in India.\n\nThe AI Playbook workstream is progressing through two major components: the Future Farming Playbook for agriculture and the Future SMEs Playbook for MSMEs. These reports, to be published in early 2025, are being developed with insights from approximately 20 experts from domain, policy and technology spheres.\n\nThese multi-stakeholder communities are pivotal in shaping frameworks that address India\u2019s unique socio-economic landscape while driving ethical and responsible AI adoption. The AI Playbooks integrate governance guidelines, actionable steps and best practices, ensuring inclusivity and scalability across India.\n\n\"At Mahindra, we believe in harnessing technology to drive meaningful change across industries. The AI for India 2030 initiative aligns perfectly with our vision of leveraging AI to create sustainable, impactful solutions. As part of this journey with the World Economic Forum, we look forward to shaping India\u2019s future as a global leader in AI,\" said Mohit Kapoor, Group Chief Technology Officer, Mahindra.\n\nThe AI Sandbox, on the other hand, provides a controlled environment for testing and refining AI solutions before large-scale deployment. By offering startups and SMEs access to high-performance computing, datasets and mentorship, the sandbox democratizes AI innovation and ensures equitable participation.\n\nLessons learned from international collaborations, such as the AI Governance Alliance, further enhance the sandbox\u2019s ability to integrate global best practices into India\u2019s unique context. The AI Sandbox workstream has also seen significant advancements, with a multi-stakeholder community now deliberating on its value proposition. These discussions focus on identifying challenges and opportunities to unlock the sandbox\u2019s full potential.\n\nEkroop Caur, Secretary, Department of Electronics, Information Technology, Biotechnology and Science & Technology, Government of Karnataka, said: \"As India\u2019s IT and start-up capital, Karnataka is committed to becoming a global leader in AI.\n\n\"We aim to build a robust AI environment that advances priority sectors such as agriculture, healthcare and education, positioning India as a hub for sustainable, tech-driven innovation. By providing a platform and sandbox for scaling AI solutions, we strive to empower businesses and drive impactful transformation through this collaboration.\"\n\nAfter the publication of the playbooks and the AI Sandbox workstream, the community will work towards adopting and scaling these actionable frameworks, ensuring widespread impact across priority sectors in India.\n\nIndia's role in the global AI ecosystem\n\n\"AI is set to reshape India\u2019s tech landscape, and AI for India 2030 is the launchpad for that change. At Sarvam, we\u2019re on a mission to make AI accessible and impactful for Bharat\u2019s unique needs \u2013 and we\u2019re excited to help drive this transformation forward,\" said Pratyush Kumar, Co-Founder, Sarvam AI.\n\nIndia\u2019s journey toward becoming a global AI leader is deeply rooted in its commitment to ethical and inclusive practices. Through initiatives like AI for India 2030, the Indian economy is not only advancing its own socio-economic goals, but also contributing to the global dialogue on responsible AI governance.\n\nFor instance, India\u2019s ability to develop sovereign AI solutions tailored to its cultural and economic nuances has significant implications for the global AI landscape. \"Global use cases don\u2019t factor in the nuances of our culture. We need to build sovereign AI for India,\" said a council member, emphasizing the importance of context-specific innovation.\n\n\"Our efforts to upskill the workforce for the jobs of the future must be accompanied by the creation or fostering of a higher demand for these workers,\" says Shri Jayesh Ranjan, a special invitee to the Advisory Council. His words underscore the need to match workforce development with the demand for skilled labour.\n\nBy actively engaging in international forums and frameworks, such as the AI Governance Alliance, India is helping to shape global norms for responsible AI adoption. This approach not only bolsters India\u2019s global standing but also reinforces its role as a model for leveraging AI to address local challenges.\n\nLooking ahead for the future of AI\n\nThe AI for India 2030 initiative demonstrates that India is poised to lead the global AI revolution while ensuring that innovation benefits all segments of society.\n\nAs discussions continue at the World Economic Forum\u2019s Annual Meeting in Davos, the focus will remain on scaling AI solutions, fostering partnerships and building a sustainable future through technology.\n\nRohini Srivathsa, Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft India and South Asia, said: \"We at Microsoft believe AI has immense potential to benefit people, industries and governments, and we are committed to co-piloting India towards becoming an AI-first country.\n\n\"We are proud to be part of the AI for India 2030 initiative, as it fosters an environment of trust among multiple stakeholders, which is crucial for unlocking AI\u2019s full value.\n\n\"Our collaboration with the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution India unites the ecosystem to ensure that India adopts and scales AI in a manner that promotes trust, inclusion and responsibility.\""
