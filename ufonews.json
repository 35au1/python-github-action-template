It added that the testers have raised questions about the effectiveness of the revamp, which was led by Mustafa Suleyman , the former DeepMind co-founder hired to spearhead Microsoft's consumer AI efforts.On October 1, Microsoft released a major update which Suleyman said is \u201can AI companion for everyone\u201d that offers more intuitive design, more digestible, speedy and fluent answers. It was touted as a significant step towards a more conversational and helpful AI companion.On Blind, a private message board for verified employees, Microsoft staff expressed their disappointment, a report by Business Insider said.While some employees and users said that the new version is worse than the previous incarnation, another commented \"Absolutely ruined.\"\u201cThe new Copilot is a step backward,\u201d another person wrote in the Microsoft group on Blind, with a third adding, \u201cThe new Copilot update is bad.\u201dUsers complain about various issues, including freezing, slow response times, less informative outputs, and the removal of features like real-time information and the ability to delete old conversations.Some users also expressed dissatisfaction with the shift towards an \"AI companion\" approach, stating a preference for a more functional tool.On app stores, one of the users said that the Copilot \u201cwas so good before updating to this version.\u201d Another said the Copilot app is \"dumbed down and less functional\u201d; \"Why release such an amazing app and then update it to what it is now?\" a third reviewer wrote, as per the report.There was one positive review that complimented the app's new user interface for being \"designed for general users.\"\u201cToday, you are seeing the first careful steps in this direction with an emphasis on creating a simpler, calmer experience and giving everyone access to new Voice capabilities that unlock a new way of communicating with AI that's much more natural, and more fun,\u201d said Kumar, a Microsoft general manager.However, users appeared unimpressed with the move as they \u201cwant a tool\u201d and \u201cnot a friend.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Sleep paralysis and the illusion of ghostly encounters\n\n\n\nCarbon Monoxide: The silent phantom behind ghostly visions\n\n\n\nBrain anomalies: Exploring neurological causes of paranormal sensations\n\n\n\nEmotional grief and ghostly experiences: The power of memories\n\n\n\nAlso Read |\n\nGhostly encounters and paranormal experiences have fascinated and terrified people for centuries, often being attributed to supernatural forces . However, as The Daily Guardian reports, scientific research increasingly challenges these mystical explanations, revealing how our mind, body, and environment can create ghostly sensations.Conditions such as sleep paralysis, carbon monoxide exposure, neurological abnormalities, and emotional states like grief can all lead to experiences that mimic ghostly sightings. Researchers have even found that stimulating certain brain regions can cause illusions of ghostly presences. While these findings shed light on why people may perceive apparitions, they also remind us of the limits of our understanding, leaving some mystery intact.Let\u2019s explore these surprising causes behind paranormal experiences and how science and the mind intersect to create eerie perceptions.One possible explanation for ghost sightings is sleep paralysis, as noted by The Daily Guardian. The NHS describes this condition as a temporary inability to move or speak while transitioning between sleep and wakefulness. Sleep paralysis occurs during REM sleep\u2014a phase when the brain is most active\u2014and can lead to vivid, intense dreams.People experiencing sleep paralysis often report sensations of chest pressure or terrifying visions of shadowy figures, a phenomenon historically associated with supernatural folklore and known as \u201cold hag syndrome.\u201dAnother surprising source of ghostly visions could be carbon monoxide. This colourless, odourless gas, often produced by malfunctioning appliances, can cause confusion and vivid hallucinations. Historical reports dating as far back as the 1920s have linked carbon monoxide exposure to ghostly experiences, as victims described seeing or hearing things that were not there.Recent research shows that brain abnormalities can also trigger paranormal-like sensations. A 2017 case study involving a 26-year-old epilepsy patient found that stimulating the fusiform face area (FFA)\u2014the part of the brain responsible for facial recognition\u2014caused unsettling hallucinations in which familiar faces transformed into distorted, cartoon-like figures.Similarly, a 22-year-old epilepsy patient reported sensing a \u201cpresence\u201d behind her when specific brain areas were activated. Neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease can also lead to ghostly visions, making these experiences more common than one might assume.Ghostly experiences can also stem from profound emotional responses, especially during intense grief. Studies show that people often \u201csee\u201d or \u201chear\u201d deceased loved ones. Psychologists attribute this to \u201cschemas\u201d\u2014mental patterns formed through familiar routines and strong emotional bonds. After a loved one\u2019s passing, these schemas can be so powerful that the sense of their presence lingers as a vivid, almost tangible memory.So, the next time you catch sight of a shadow or hear a familiar voice, consider that it may be your brain, a gas leak, or the mysteries of sleep at work. While science has provided explanations for many ghostly encounters, there remains a space for the unknown, leaving us to wonder about what lies beyond the reach of our understanding."

        "article_content": "Samsung 990 Pro MSRP $180.00 Score Details \u201cLet's not mince words \u2014 the Samsung 990 Pro is insanely fast.\u201d Pros Crazy fast\n\nOptions with and without a heatsink\n\nCapacity up to 4TB\n\nSeveral features through Samsung Magician Cons Overkill for the PS5\n\nHeatsink is impractical for most\n\nI won\u2019t waste your time here. The Samsung 990 Pro is the best SSD you can buy right now. It\u2019s crazy fast, particularly when it comes to large file transfers, and despite a relatively high price, Samsung justifies the cost with extra features that few other brands go out of their way to fuss with.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe particular model I\u2019m looking at here, the Samsung 990 Pro 2TB with heatsink, may not be the right pick for everyone, though. Although it\u2019s a very fast drive, the extra cost of the heatsink and its slant toward expanding the storage inside the PlayStation 5 doesn\u2019t make sense, and you can save some money with a slower drive while achieving similar levels of gaming performance.\n\nPerformance outside of games is a different matter, however, which is where the 990 Pro truly stands out. If you want to learn more about SSD performance and how it varies between applications, make sure to check out our SSD buying guide.\n\nPricing and specs\n\n1TB 2TB 4TB Sequential read/write Up to 7,450MB/s, 6,900MB/s Up to 7,450MB/s, 6,900MB/s Up to 7,450MB/s, 6,900MB/s Random read/write Up to 1.2M IOPS, 1.55M IOPS Up to 1.4M IOPS, 1.55M IOPS Up to 1.6M IOPS, 1.55M IOPS Cache 1GB low power DDR4 2GB low power DDR4 4GB low power DDR4 Memory Samsung V-NAND 3-bit TLC Samsung V-NAND 3-bit TLC Samsung V-NAND 3-bit TLC Interface PCIe Gen 4.0 x4 PCIe Gen 4.0 x4 PCIe Gen 4.0 x4 Form factor M.2 2280 M.2 2280 M.2 2280 Max power consumption 7.8W 8.5W 8.6W Dimensions 80.15 x 25 x 8.88mm 80.15 x 25 x 8.88mm 80.15 x 25 x 8.88mm Price $130 $180 $330\n\nSamsung has remained the go-to brand for NVMe SSD for many years, and it\u2019s clear why. You\u2019re getting close to the maximum bandwidth of a PCIe 4.0 x4 interface, with Samsung touting sequential read speeds of up to 7,450MB/s. My testing backs up Samsung\u2019s claims, making this one of the fastest PCIe 4.0 SSDs you can currently buy.\n\nUnlike most other SSDs on the market, Samsung is using its own in-house NAND and controller for the 990 Pro, which generally makes it less prone to hardware swaps after launch. Other SSD brands that outsource NAND and controllers can run into supply issues and swap out components, sometimes at the cost of advertised speed. Thankfully, that\u2019s not the case here. You\u2019re also getting small amount of DDR4 as a cache, speeding up the performance of the drive.\n\nPricing is where things get interesting. This model of the 990 Pro is heavily targeted toward the PS5 due to having its own heatsink. That bit of extra metal drives up the price. At 2TB, you can save $10 by going with the 990 Pro model without a heatsink. And if you go up to 4TB, you\u2019ll save $30. That\u2019s compared to Samsung\u2019s own 990 Pro, too. If you shop for a drive like the WD Black SN850X, you\u2019ll get similar speeds for much less money \u2014 sans the heatsink.\n\nMost modern motherboards have heatsinks for the SSD drives, and in fact, the extra heatsink size can interfere with your other components. This is really a drive built for other applications, such as the PS5 Pro, or a mini PC with enough space but no heatsink, such as the Minisforum AtomMan G7 Ti.\n\nSoftware and features\n\nSamsung may have fast drives, but it also has excellent management software. I wouldn\u2019t blame you for ignoring the bundled software with most SSDs, but Samsung Magician has a lot of options, and it\u2019s worth taking up a bit of space to install the application.\n\nYou get some high-level stats, such as drive health, and you can perform a benchmark and diagnostic to see how your drive is performing. More importantly, Samsung gives you a ton of options to tweak the performance of your drive. You can turn on TRIM to let deleted blocks surface again for writing, as well as prevent the SSD from sleeping for maximum performance. Samsung also has over-provisioning options to increase the life span of the drive.\n\nBeyond performance, you have encryption options, data migration, and a proper erase function. This will restructure all of the data on the drive so it can\u2019t be recovered with forensics.\n\nPerformance\n\nSetting the scene, CrystalDiskMark shows that the 990 Pro with heatsink actually reaches a bit above Samsung\u2019s advertised speeds, both for sequential reads and writes. We\u2019re getting close to maxing out the available bandwidth on a PCIe 4.0 x4 interface, at least for sequential reads and writes. That\u2019s not what your drive is going to be doing most of the time, however.\n\nLooking at real applications provides some important context, as the margins between the 990 Pro 2TB and a much cheaper (and slower) drive like the WD Blue SN5000 shrink considerably. In large file transfers, which you can see in my AJA Video Systems test, the 990 Pro reigns supreme. There are some minor differences between the 1TB and 2TB models I tested, but not a big enough difference to note.\n\nSamsung 990 Pro 2TB w/ Heatsink WD Blue SN5000 4TB Samsung 990 Pro 1TB AJA Video Systems (read/write) 6,090 / 5,994MB/s 4,353 / 4,589MB/s 6,040 / 5,921MB/s PCMark 10 3,677 3,523 3,811 3DMark 3,372 3,621 3,650 Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail (seconds, lower is better) 7.59 seconds 7.11 seconds 7.24 seconds\n\nIn games, however, the 990 Pro 2TB with heatsink actually fell behind the pack. Both the SN5000 and regular 990 Pro posted better results in 3DMark \u2014 which actually loads games through the benchmark \u2014 and Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail. The 2TB 990 Pro isn\u2019t far behind, and when we\u2019re talking about margins of half a second, you\u2019ll never notice a meaningful difference in performance. On paper, however, it\u2019s a bit behind.\n\nShould you buy the Samsung 990 Pro?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for one of the fastest SSDs on the market for your PC, the Samsung 990 Pro hits that mark squarely. There\u2019s no doubt that the Samsung 990 Pro is a fast SSD, but I\u2019m not sure going with this specific model is the right call for the PS5. There are a couple of important reasons why.\n\nFirst, the heatsink. There are only a few instances where an SSD calls for a heatsink, and even in those cases, you probably won\u2019t reach damaging temperatures without one. If you plan on putting the 990 Pro inside a PC, save yourself some money and go with the heatsink-free model.\n\nThe bigger issue is the speed for gaming. This drive is heavily targeted toward the PS5, which is a platform that really can\u2019t take advantage of the extra speed on offer. In games, even the objectively slower SN5000 is putting up similar results, and you can pick up that drive for $120 \u2014 a clean $60 less than the 990 Pro 2TB with heatsink.\n\nThe best use case for a drive this fast isn\u2019t gaming \u2014 most PCIe 4.0 SSDs are plenty for gaming, with only minor differences in loading speed. The 990 Pro really shines when it comes to large file transfers, where its sustained speed advantage really shows up clearly. In that context, the 990 Pro is worth spending up for."
