            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nWhistleblowers have claimed there is a secret Pentagon UFO data retrieval program codenamed Immaculate Constellation. The program supposedly is used to \u201cdetect\u201d and \u201cquarantine\u201d the military\u2019s best UFO imagery, videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis program has supposedly been hidden from Congressional oversight since 2017, the whistleblowers claim. Immaculate Constellation is what is known, according to a government source, as an \u201cUnacknowledged Special Access Program,\u201d or USAP.\n\nNaturally, a Pentagon spokesperson denied the existence of the program. Really though, what else could they have said about a government program that the whistleblowers claim is \u201cabove top secret?\u201d\n\nThis week, more fuel was added to the conspiratorial fire when an email containing UFO images allegedly from the U.S. military were leaked online by an anonymous source.\n\nAccording to DailyMail.com\u2026\n\nThe black-and-white images show ornately spiked \u2018cruciform\u2019 UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating \u2018hot\u2019 cube, traditional flying saucers and several other craft that look straight out of classic science fiction. The screengrabs are said to be from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by military \u2018heads up displays,\u2019 but details were redacted to protect both sensitive US national security interests.\n\n\u201cThis person has asked me to redact their email address, although I can tell you that there is nothing identifiable in it,\u201d said Nathan Latvaitis of the YouTube channel Strange Mysteries, which has almost two million subscribers and is where the images were first made public.\n\n\u201cThe UAPs [Unidentified Aerial Phenomena] observed demonstrate capabilities far beyond conventional aerospace benchmarks,\u201d the whistleblower wrote about the photographs that were allegedly taken at sensitive military locations.\n\n\u201cShape-shifting has been observed \u2014 possibly due to advanced cloaking or optical refraction \u2014 referred to as \u2018morphogenic behavior,\u2019 allowing for adaptation to environments or missions,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also addressed those who doubt the images authenticity.\n\n\u201cMany traditional media outlets would require verification of my identity and credentials,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is not feasible due to the risks involved. [Those news media] organizations, despite their best intentions, are not equipped to handle the level of secrecy and potential retaliation associated with this information.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was part of one of the legacy programs,\u201d he continued. \u201cI know that\u2019s vague, but unfortunately that\u2019s all I can offer at this point.\u201d\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger, founder of the website Public, was one of the witnesses to testify before Congress in November. He said in his testimony that the Immaculate Constellation program has thousands of images of UFOs.\n\n\u201cWhat the American people need to know is that the U.S., military and intelligence community are sitting on a huge amount of visual and other information: still photos, video, photos, other sensor information, and they have for a very long time,\u201d Shellenberger said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not those fuzzy photos and videos that we\u2019ve been given. There\u2019s very clear, high resolution [images].\u201d"

Nobody has combined AI and wellness better than the folks behind the new Pensive app, and you can experience their evidence-based, always-accessible coaching for 50% off from now through Jan. 1.\n\nSee at Pensive\n\nStart with the free 7-day trial to see how you can benefit from Pensive\u2019s 5-minute daily conversations. If you\u2019re like the other early users of this revolutionary new app, who have given Pensive a stellar average rating of 4.9 stars, you\u2019ll discover this is an innovative and effective way to help make your mental health resolutions stick in 2025.\n\nAI Therapy Is Having a Moment\n\nInterest in AI mental wellness support has been exploding \u2014 up by 400% as people seek new, inexpensive methods of maintaining their mental health that are also accessible 24/7. In-person therapy is expensive, often not covered by health insurance, and even the very best human therapists aren\u2019t at your beck and call 24/7.\n\nThe earliest iteration of AI coaching has been mostly in the form of generic chatbots, which have minimal efficacy at best and carry risks of misuse and poor results. But Pensive delves deep into the enormous potential of AI, grounded in evidence-based techniques and drawing on everything from classical schools of thought like Buddhism and Stoicism to modern psychology and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n\nAlways There for You\n\nPensive\u2019s mental wellness benefits come from daily conversations that are as short as 5 minutes long, and can be used on their own or in conjunction with traditional human therapy. While Pensive is not a replacement for diagnosing or professionally treating mental health disorders, it has shown immense promise as an addition to traditional therapy and also as a personal coach to help people solve their problems.\n\nWith an average user rating of 4.9/5 stars in the App Store, it\u2019s clear that early users of this groundbreaking app are experiencing real benefits from it. Pensive is the virtual mental-health coach who\u2019s with you whenever your phone is, so you are never more than a click away from a quick session when you need it. (Also, no co-pays.)\n\nA 7-day free trial and a 50% off deal are the ideal conditions for you to download Pensive and give AI coaching a chance to improve your overall mental wellbeing. Click the link and take advantage before Jan. 1 when the 50% off deal expires.\n\nSee at Pensive"

            "article_content": "When I hear the word \"budgeting,\" I don't typically think of the word \"fun.\" While I've enjoyed test-driving popular tools such as YNAB and EveryDollar, most budgeting apps make me feel like I'm 16 years old and listening to my parents lecture me on the dangers of overspending.\n\nCleo, however, is an exception to the norm. The app makes managing your money feel more like a game with spending and saving challenges, and its sassy AI chatbot might actually make you smile. For example, it invited me to \"unfuck\" my finances\" -- a phrase that has definitely never emerged from my parents' mouths.\n\nRead on to learn more about Cleo and whether it's worth adding to your phone.\n\nCleo Like Sassy AI chatbot\n\nSassy AI chatbot Savings challenges\n\nSavings challenges Free basic budgeting features Don't like AI doesn't mean \"hands-off\"\n\nAI doesn't mean \"hands-off\" Cash advances may be too tempting\n\nCash advances may be too tempting Paid features may not be worth it\n\nHow does Cleo work?\n\nCleo feels similar to most budgeting apps when it comes to the basics of money management. You share your banking details via a secure third-party service, such as Plaid, and your transaction history automatically populates in the app's \"Spend\" tab.\n\nYou'll get a monthly breakdown in four categories: What's due, what you've saved, what you've spent and an overall limit.\n\nFor me, the most useful information came from the \"Overview\" section, which showed me my credit card spending by merchant. I knew I went to Target a lot, but I wasn't quite prepared to learn that last year, I spent more than $4,389 there.\n\nWhat sets Cleo apart is the \"Ask Cleo\" tab, which allows you to talk with an AI chatbot about your money. For example, I asked if I could afford to spend $500 on a gift, and after a quick analysis of the cash in my accounts, the chatbot told me, \"Go for it, pal.\" The bot also invites you to take a quiz to see how well you understand your finances.\n\nThe app is fun, but it's not perfect. For example, it incorrectly assumed some one-time purchases were recurring bills.\n\nCleo has a free version, which gives you basic budgeting features, as well as three paid subscription tiers:\n\nCleo Grow ($2.99 a month) offers savings challenges and access to Cleo's high-yield savings account.\n\noffers savings challenges and access to Cleo's high-yield savings account. Cleo Plus ($5.99 a month) allows you to request cash advances up to $250.\n\nallows you to request cash advances up to $250. Cleo Builder ($14.99 a month) allows you to requestcash advances up to $500 and add a secured credit card to your wallet.\n\nWhat I liked\n\nArtificial intelligence encourages real accountability: Finances can be an awkward topic, and having someone -- or something -- to hold you accountable can help you stay on track. Cleo's AI can act as that accountability partner without the discomfort that can come with normal money discussions.\n\nFinances can be an awkward topic, and having someone -- or something -- to hold you accountable can help you stay on track. Cleo's AI can act as that accountability partner without the discomfort that can come with normal money discussions. Challenges can keep you motivated: Cleo automatically reviews your transaction history to identify where you should try to spend less. For example, the app recommended I limit my Target spending to $158 for the next 14 days for an estimated savings of $40. Cleo delivered updates and encouragement throughout the challenge to encourage me to stick with it.\n\nCleo automatically reviews your transaction history to identify where you should try to spend less. For example, the app recommended I limit my Target spending to $158 for the next 14 days for an estimated savings of $40. Cleo delivered updates and encouragement throughout the challenge to encourage me to stick with it. Free features: You can automatically sync your bank accounts and get a basic understanding of your cash flow without paying anything for the app. The functionality is limited, though. For example, you can't use the challenge feature without upgrading to a paid tier. But the free version is still a valuable way to see if you like the app before signing up for a subscription.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\nAI doesn't mean you should your money on autopilot: I believe that AI can help solve some people's money problems, but it can't do it all. While I was genuinely impressed with Cleo's AI chatbot, the app's automated understanding of my bills was far from perfect. And overspending is a human problem, so you need to commit some of your own energy to make budgeting a success.\n\nI believe that AI can help solve some people's money problems, but it can't do it all. While I was genuinely impressed with Cleo's AI chatbot, the app's automated understanding of my bills was far from perfect. And overspending is a human problem, so you need to commit some of your own energy to make budgeting a success. Cash advances aren't a long-term solution: Cleo offers interest-free cash advances between $250 and $500. These can be appealing if you're struggling to make ends meet, but they won't help you learn to avoid the need for extra cash in the future. A cash advance should be a one-time necessity, not a regular solution.\n\nCleo offers interest-free cash advances between $250 and $500. These can be appealing if you're struggling to make ends meet, but they won't help you learn to avoid the need for extra cash in the future. A cash advance should be a one-time necessity, not a regular solution. Paid features may not be worth it: In addition to cash advances, the main perks of Cleo's paid tiers include access to a secured credit card and savings account. With plenty of free bank accounts and secured credit cards out there, this isn't all that unique. And while Cleo's savings account has a respectable 3.52% annual percentage yield, or APY, some of the best high-yield savings accounts pay as much as 5% APY.\n\nIs Cleo safe?\n\nYes. Cleo uses 256-bit encryption to protect your information. It also uses Plaid to sync with your bank accounts and never stores any of your banking details. In addition, the company doesn't sell your data, which means you never have to worry that your financial information will wind up in the hands of some other company trying to sell you additional products or services.\n\nWho is Cleo best suited for?\n\nIf you're bored by the usual budgeting apps or need help sticking to your spending goals, Cleo could be for you. Its fun AI chatbot and custom savings challenges can make budgeting more enjoyable and motivate you to be smarter with your money.\n\nThe app's features also feel tailored to people who haven't had a great experience with the traditional banking industry. For example, if you've struggled with overdraft fees or need help boosting your credit, Cleo's Builder tier offers cash advances and a secured credit card.\n\nAlternatives to the Cleo app\n\nThere are plenty of other budgeting apps worth considering if Cleo isn't right for you. For example, Rocket Money has plenty of features and an easy-to-use interface for free or as little as $6 a month.\n\nIf you're attracted to Cleo's cash advances and savings account, you might enjoy Chime. Chime is a banking app rather than a budgeting app, but it offers a secured credit card, a checking account and a high-yield savings account -- without the need to pay monthly fees. Plus, its MyPay tool allows you to access up to $500 of your paycheck early, free of charge. (Unless you need the cash immediately, in which case there's a $2 fee).\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Cleo legit? Yes. Cleo has been in business since 2016 and available in the US since 2018. According to the company's latest figures, more than five million people use the app. Cleo partners with Thread Bank for its savings account and WebBank for its secured credit card.\n\nHow much does Cleo cost? Cleo has a free version with limited functionality. To take advantage of more of the app's features, you can upgrade to one of the three paid tiers. Cleo Grow costs $2.99 a month and includes the ability to create challenges, round up spending and open a linked high-yield savings account. Cleo Plus costs $5.99 a month and offers cash advances up to $250. Cleo Builder costs $14.99 a month and includes a secured credit card, priority customer support and cash advances up to $500.\n\nIs Cleo worth paying for? With 4.6 out of 5 stars on the App Store and 4.3 on Google Play, it's clear that a lot of people love Cleo. Its AI chatbot is a useful way to learn more about your finances, and its casual tone injects some fun into budgeting. That said, you can get many of the premium services Cleo offers without a monthly fee. For example, Chime's Credit Builder Card has no annual fee, and the financial tech company's online checking account offers a $500 payday advance option for eligible users -- all at no extra cost. So, if you're thinking of springing for one of Cleo's pricier subscriptions, you may want to weigh your options.\n\nMore budgeting apps"

            "article_content": "Increasingly, over the last few decades, modern pop culture has warmed up to embracing the frightful chills of the winter holidays in films like Gremlins, Black Christmas, Terrifier 3 \u2026 Love Actually. But the historical roots of this time of year have always had a darker, spookier side. Long before Charles Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol \u2014 an era when families of Victorian England gathered to share ghost stories by the fire on Christmas Eve \u2014 pre-Christian folklore told of a thin veil between worlds, where spirits (and goblins, beasts, and gods) lingered during the winter solstice.\n\nThose ancient beliefs blend with modern natural introspection of the holidays. Along with the (sometimes saccharine) jubilations, Christmas and the winter festivities encourage people to reflect on the past, lost loved ones, and the lingering \u201cghosts\u201d of memory. Add to that how this month is populated by magical home invaders, and a creepy surveillance imp on the shelf, and December is a rather fitting time for mystery, the macabre, and paranormal tales.\n\nCelebrating the scarier side of the holidays is not only a sort of subversive counter-programming by pairing cheer with fear, it allows us to acknowledge the dichotomy of light and dark, contrasting cozy, nostalgic evenings with long, eerily silent nights.\n\nAll of this is a very drawn out way of saying I love getting creepy, spooky, and downright scary gifts for the holidays, and I love shopping for loved ones who also appreciate a little splash of blood red with their Christmases so white. And so, we return with a Talking Strange Show \u201cSeason\u2019s Screamings Gift Guide\u201d for 2024. After the success of last year\u2019s guide, we are going bigger and bloodier with gift suggestions for the horror and paranormal fans in your life. Comic books, action figures, statues, graphic novels, swanky shirts and hats, paranormal investigation equipment, and even some vodka and cologne are all included, and all part of the theme."

Visitors will have the chance to hear about various ghost encounters that have been experienced in the mansion.\n\nDuring past tours, some participants have reported hearing the faint sound of piano keys playing, even when no one was at the keyboard. This phenomenon is believed to be linked to Maddie and Melville Moss, both musicians with an affinity for the piano. All interactions documented at the mansion have been described as peaceful and lighthearted.\n\nThe Montana Paranormal Society investigated the Moss Mansion and experienced an electronic voice phenomenon. While in the dining room, they commented that it was a lovely home and received a response.\n\n\"When they got a voice back saying 'thank you,' and they were kind of in this area out here the main area at the base of the staircase and they said 'let's go upstairs' and they got a voice back saying 'I can't,' in the library it very much sounds like there's someone that's not in the room with them trying to have a conversation with them over one of the EVP audios that we have, so we think we have very polite ghosts nothing like malicious or evil,\" said Heggem.\n\nOther reported interactions include the faint scent of cigars in the library and seeing or feeling figures in various places throughout the building.\n\nThe Moss family has experienced some tragedies, and during that time, it was common to die at home. It is believed that many of the family's spirits remain. Heggem shared, \"The youngest daughter, Virginia, she died when she was six, she caught something called Diphtheria which is basically a bad flu and it killed her very young and that was a really hard death on the family, so we think Virginia's ghost is still here, she seems very playful and she likes you know interacting with people especially children.\"\n\nThe staff who maintain the grounds treat the house as if it were a living entity, greeting and saying goodbye to the mansion every day.\n\nVisitors are reminded to remain respectful of the house and any spirit interactions they may have during the tour. Participants are advised not to touch anything and to listen to their tour guide."

            "article_content": "Imagine knowing you\u2019ve already made an important contribution to biomedical research before you\u2019ve even started high school. This is a reality for a young Chicago student who recently found a bacterium that exhibits antibiotic activity and produces a novel compound that slows the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells in the lab. Where did this startling discovery come from? Well, goose poop of course.\n\nThis budding young middle school scientist was part of a community partnership with a local university that engages kids from underrepresented and low-income backgrounds. The team partnered with Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, which allowed them to engage with middle schoolers as part of a 14-week applied science program.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nInequality in educational resources, especially for STEM subjects, has often prevented some students from accessing these fields when they\u2019re older. However, a team from the University of Illinois at Chicago, led by Brian Murphy, has established a partnership that engages such groups at an early stage in their educational development. The hope is that, by providing them with a chance to conduct real, high-quality research, these young students will come to see themselves as scientists and explore related careers in the future.\n\nAs Murphy\u2019s lab is focused on finding antibiotics from natural sources, the students helped scour their local communities for environmental samples. Before someone suggests this was just a way to outsource sample gathering, the students then followed up on the stages of scientific processing, especially for programming a specialized robot that removes bacterial colonies from growth plates and tests them for antibiotic activity.\n\n\u201cAll experiments are performed under the guidance of graduate student or postdoctoral scientist volunteer mentors\u201d, the researchers explain in their study.\n\n\u201cEach student collected 3 samples of their choice from Garfield Park in Chicago, IL. Students pretreated and diluted their samples before plating each one on three different media types [....] While their bacteria incubated, they practiced block programming on LEGO EV3 modules in preparation for robot operation. When their environmental diversity plates exhibited sufficient bacterial growth, students programmed and operated the Hudson Robotics RapidPickMP to pick all distinguishable colonies from their environmental diversity plates and transfer them onto dual-sided agar plate assay (DAPA) bioassay plates.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDuring their search, one student returned with a sample of goose poop that contained a strain of bacteria called Pseudomonas idahonensis \u2013 a species that had previously been isolated from rainbow trout in Idaho (idahonensis means \u201cfrom Idaho). The student, Camarria Williams, and Jonathon Rodriguez, Technology Program Manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, are listed as co-authors of the paper\n\nIt was concluded that this bacterium had antibiotic activity and even produced a completely new-to-science compound. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry, the university researchers were able to determine that orfamide N was not actually responsible for the antibiotic activity observed before. However, the compound did hinder the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells when it was tested in the laboratory.\n\nIt is believed that further testing could reveal additional advantageous properties of this new molecule.\n\nThis project demonstrates that it is possible to combine educational outreach with natural product discovery research while also showing how important it is to develop strong relationships between universities and local communities. In particular, it offers typically under-represented students a chance to be scientists themselves and to make incredible discoveries like this!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGuess we should also thank the goose for providing its poop as well.\n\nThe study is published in the journal ACS Omega."

The specimen, a near-perfectly preserved male, was discovered washed ashore on a South Island beach, marking a monumental moment for both marine science and Maori cultural heritage.\n\nThe dissection revealed fascinating biological details, including nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, and vestigial teeth that provide insights into its evolutionary past. However, the whale's broken jaw and bruising led scientists to believe that head trauma might be the cause of its death, though the exact circumstances remain unknown.\n\nThe collaboration between scientists and local Maori communities was a unique aspect of this project, integrating Indigenous knowledge into the scientific process. Post-dissection, the whale's jawbone and teeth will be preserved by the Maori tribe, with 3D replicas to be displayed in museums. This event underscores New Zealand's status as a whale-stranding hotspot and emphasizes the cultural significance of whales as a taonga, or treasure, to the Maori people.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Thief vs. thief Always another way\n\nThief is getting a spiritual successor in the form of Thick as Thieves. The project, which is being developed by an all-star team that includes genre legend Warren Spector, is a multiplayer immersive sim scheduled to launch in 2026 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nRevealed at the 2024 Game Awards with a trailer, Thick as Thieves takes the basic principles of Thief, a landmark stealth series, but shuffles them into a four-player PvPvE game. It\u2019s a stealth-action game where four thieves all hop into one mission and compete to pull off a loot heist first. While it\u2019s not officially a Thief game, the project is being directed by Greg LoPiccolo, the director of 1998\u2019s Thief: The Dark Project, at Otherside, a studio co-founded by Spector. That makes the project an evolution of the immersive sim created by some of the genre\u2019s most influential names.\n\nAhead of its reveal, Digital Trends got a behind-the-scenes look at Thick as Thieves, which included a five-minute gameplay reel not shown at The Game Awards. The presentation highlighted how Otherside is looking to push the genre forward by combining a classic genre with modern ideas inspired by multiplayer genres like the extraction shooter. There\u2019s a good reason for that too, as Spector told Digital Trends during an interview.\n\n\u201cMy secret goal is that I want to make sure that immersive sims keep going and keep making progress long after I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\nThief vs. thief\n\nThick as Thieves is a bit of a dream project for Spector, who says he has dreamed of making a multiplayer immersive sim like this for decades. There\u2019s perhaps a reason it hasn\u2019t happened until now: The two genres seemed incompatible at a surface glance. Even Spector, an industry veteran who worked on several influential games, admits that he was out of his depth at first.\n\n\u201cI have no idea how to make a PvP stealth game! Stealth games are about not interacting and PvP games are about interacting!\u201d Spector says. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of challenge we want to take on at Otherside.\u201d\n\nIt was only once Spector started assembling a team at Otherside to bring that vision to life that the project came together. The crew would include LoPiccolo on directing duties, as well as lead designer David McDonough, whose recent credits include XCOM: Chimera Squad and system design work on the next Bioshock game. After looking at a wide range of multiplayer genres, including battle royale games, the team eventually drew ideas from asymmetrical titles and extraction games. That gave birth to a PvPvE mix that neatly fit into the core philosophy of games like Thief.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this form of interaction, which Warren likes to quote: \u2018It\u2019s competition, not combat,\u2019\u201d MacDonough tells Digital Trends. \u201cThe thieves compete intensely in our game, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have to fight each other. They could be competing for different things and all make it out with some mixture of success that means something to each of them, even though they fought fiercely. We saw that kind of stuff in extraction games. Our game isn\u2019t as hard-nosed as a real extraction game with permadeath, but there\u2019s clearly an appetite for this kind of more sophisticated, nuanced, thinking man\u2019s multiplayer game.\u201d\n\nThe premise is that players can choose from an array of thieves, each of which have their own special abilities and career progression. The Spider, for instance, is a female thief that can use a grappling hook to zip around. The story campaign is split into missions that players load into from a hub. Each one tasks them with some kind of infiltration mission that can be tackled in any number of ways as they hunt down loot. The twist? Four players are matched together in the same mission at once \u2014 and only one can walk away with the loot. That turns each 20- to 30-minute session into a game of wits as players can either try to knock out their rivals or indirectly eliminate them by getting guards on their tail.\n\nIn the recorded demo I saw, Spider had to sneak into a mansion and steal some loot. She starts by zipping to the rooftops around it and scouting the area for a way in. While she\u2019s doing that, another player on a far-off roof sees her and starts shooting darts at her, forcing her to run and look for another way in. She eventually decides to sneak in through a sewer grate, wading through muck to wind up in the mansion\u2019s basement. From there, she uses stealth to knock out guards, find clues, and crack safes. The team tells me that these missions aren\u2019t static. Safe codes can change, guard patrol routes shifts, and players can approach them in new ways as they buy new gear over time.\n\nMany of the core ideas of the immersive sim genre are present, as players have a lot of different ways to approach a situation. The multiplayer component gave the team space to experiment with new tricks, though. For instance, players can only carry so much loot at once. When their inventory is filled, they\u2019ll need to drop some off into storage, potentially taking time away from completing the main objective of a mission. The more items players carry, the easier it is for guards to spot them. Sprinting can cause problems too, as that\u2019ll leave footprints around the level that other players can see and use to track opponents down. All of these ideas help Thick as Thieves feel like a genuinely new spin on a stalwart genre, one that feels like a fusion of Thief and Payday.\n\nAlways another way\n\nThe more I speak to the team, the clearer it becomes that Thick as Thieves is an important project for creators who have dedicated their careers to the immersive sim. They see it as a way to bring the genre to its next level, staying up to date with more modern games without losing the spirit of the older games they worked on. LoPiccolo points at the \u201clong chain of causalities\u201d in Thief, connecting that to the kinds of emergent storytelling moments that happen in modern multiplayer games today. Thick as Thieves could be a generational bridge if Otherside plays its cards right.\n\nThat\u2019s especially important for Spector, whose legacy is inseparable from a genre he helped create. For him, Thick as Thieves is a dream project in several ways. Not only does it realize his decades-long vision for a multiplayer immersive sim, but he also sees its approach to an ongoing campaign as fulfilling another dream he\u2019s long had as a tabletop RPG fan.\n\n\u201cThe campaign wasn\u2019t something I initially thought of. It was initially a business decision, to be frank,\u201d Spector says. \u201cI resisted it, but then one of the designers at the studio said, \u2018Warren, you\u2019ve been saying you want to make a game like Dungeons and Dragons for decades now. This is just the D&D model!\u2019 It was a forehead-slapping moment.\u201d\n\nOne of my rules is that there\u2019s always another way.\n\nIt\u2019s clear from talking that Spector is especially invested in seeing the genre he helped build reach its next form. As the conversation winds down, I ask for his reflections on where the immersive sim has gone, noting that everything from Hitman to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (\u201cThank you for pointing that out!\u201d he shouts when I label it as an immersive sim) seems to carry a bit of his mark. He\u2019s proud to see so many games embrace the genre, one that he\u2019s always believed in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really gratifying seeing how many games seem to have been influenced by immersive sims,\u201d Spector says. \u201cWhen we were working on the early games, I remember that Doug Church, secret master of gaming, and I used to sit around and say, \u2018Why isn\u2019t everybody making games like this?\u2019 I always thought it was the most mainstream thing in the world. One of my rules is that there\u2019s always another way. If I\u2019m not good enough at shooting \u2014 he said, raising his hand \u2014 try sneaking. If I\u2019m not good enough at sneaking, try talking. There\u2019s always another way. That seemed like an incredibly mainstream idea. And now we\u2019re starting to see that I was right!\u201d\n\nBefore we even formally start our interview, Spector runs through his history with the genre and throws in a surprising game as an example of an immersive sim: Epic Mickey. I\u2019m surprised to hear him namedrop it in the same breath as Deus Ex, but he promises to circle back around to it. He does so in the final minute of our conversation, neatly tying together everything we\u2019ve discussed with a bow. Spector cares so much about the genre because he sees a broad appeal in it that makes the genre so age-proof. Thick as Thieves is just one more step toward getting it in front of mainstream audiences that don\u2019t even realize they already love the format. Whether it\u2019s intentional or not, he\u2019s living by his golden rule: There\u2019s always another way.\n\n\u201cOne of my secret ideas behind Epic Mickey was that I thought with Mickey Mouse as my star, I could sneak some of the immersive sim ideas into a mainstream game,\u201d Spector says. \u201cIt was by far the bestselling game I\u2019ve ever worked on. And a lot of that was due to Mickey Mouse, I\u2019m not gonna fool myself, but I heard from a lot of normal humans that they got it. They appreciated the immersive sim qualities in that game. So, I\u2019m pretty confident that the world is ready for Thick as Thieves and a game that offers them the opportunity to play the game they want.\n\n\u201cI think we have the capability to make this kind of game and make it as deep as anyone on the planet.\u201d\n\nThick as Thieves will launch in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC."

Here\u2019s how to submit a claim.\n\nVERIFY often fact-checks settlement notices so our readers know whether they are legitimate or fraudulent.\n\nSome people, including a VERIFY journalist, received emails in December notifying them about a ParkMobile class action settlement due to a data breach. ParkMobile is a mobile parking payment app that is used in many U.S. states.\n\nGoogle Trends data show many people online are wondering if the ParkMobile data breach settlement is legitimate.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nIs the ParkMobile data breach settlement real?\n\nTHE SOURCES\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nYes, the ParkMobile data breach settlement is real.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nParkMobile customers who were notified about the parking app\u2019s 2021 data breach could receive up to $25 as part of a proposed class action settlement.\n\nThe parking payment app company agreed to a $32.8 million settlement following a 2021 lawsuit alleging it failed to protect people\u2019s personal information, court records show. ParkMobile denied any wrongdoing or liability, an official settlement website says.\n\nParkMobile also acknowledged the settlement and linked out to the official website on Dec. 5.\n\nA class action lawsuit was filed in Georgia about two months after ParkMobile confirmed a \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d linked to a third-party software in March 2021. The lawsuit alleges that about 21 million users\u2019 personal information was compromised in the data breach.\n\nAccording to ParkMobile, the leaked information included license plate numbers, email addresses, phone numbers and mailing addresses, as well as encrypted passwords but not the encryption keys required to read them. Users\u2019 credit card numbers were not leaked, the company said.\n\nWho qualifies for the settlement\n\nAnyone who received a notice from ParkMobile about the 2021 data security incident is eligible to submit a claim, according to the official website. People who are eligible also should have received an emailed notice about the class action settlement.\n\nIf you are still unsure about whether you\u2019re eligible for the settlement, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at 1-866-944-4062.\n\nAccording to the official website, $9 million of the proposed settlement has been set aside for cash payments to people affected by the data breach. The amount of money each person can receive is capped at $25, the website says.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t submit claims for cash payments will receive $1 credits from ParkMobile via email.\n\nHow to submit a claim\n\nPeople who are eligible for the settlement must submit a claim by Wednesday, March 5, 2025, the settlement website says.\n\nYou can submit a claim online using the ID and confirmation code on your mailed or emailed notice. If you don\u2019t have the notice ID and confirmation code, you can look up your login by entering your name and email address.\n\nYou can also print out a claim form here and mail it postmarked no later than March 5 to this address: ParkMobile Data Security Incident, Attn: Claim Forms, 1650 Arch Street, Suite 2210, Philadelphia, PA 19103.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when people who are eligible for the settlement could receive their payments."

From tweaks to CPF interest rates to passport-free travel initiatives, the latest headlines are filled with exciting changes\u2014both bad and good\u2014that you can expect in 2025.\n\nPlanning your finances? We\u2019ve got updates on CPF rates and the latest changes to the Basic Healthcare Sum. For frequent travelers to Johor, a passport-free immigration system could soon make those trips seamless. Plus, if you\u2019re worried about scams, the surge in adoption of the \u201cmoney lock\u201d feature shows how Singaporeans are keeping their hard-earned money safe. Dive into the details below to learn how these changes might affect you.\n\nPsst, missed last week\u2019s issue? View all past editions of What\u2019s Happening This Week? to catch up.\n\nCPF Special, MediSave and Retirement account interest rates to fall in 2025\n\nGood news, bad news: CPF\u2019s Special, MediSave, and Retirement Account (SMRA) interest rates are set to dip slightly from 4.14% to 4% for the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe decrease is due to the 12-month average yield of 10-year Singapore Government Securities (to which the SMRA rates are pegged) falling below the 4% floor rate. So, while the pegged rate technically calculates to 3.99%, CPF members can rest assured they\u2019ll still earn the guaranteed minimum rate of 4%.\n\nFor the Ordinary Account and HDB housing loans, no changes! Their rates remain steady at 2.5% and 2.6%, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the Basic Healthcare Sum for MediSave will increase to $75,500 in 2025 (up from $71,500 in 2024) for members under 65. This sum ensures sufficient savings for basic subsidised healthcare and stays fixed once you turn 65.\n\nLastly, the extra interest scheme continues. CPF members under 55 will enjoy an additional 1% on their first $60,000, while those 55 and above get up to 2% extra interest on their first $30,000, and 1% on the next $30,000. These perks also apply to those enrolled in CPF LIFE.\n\nALSO READ: Ultimate Dummies Guide to the CPF Scheme: 15 Terms You Need to Know Now\n\nPassport-free travel at Johor checkpoints by mid-2025\n\nBig news if you\u2019re a JB tripper: by mid-2025, Johor\u2019s land checkpoints may go passport-free for Singaporeans and other foreign visitors. Instead of the usual passport checks, you could breeze through immigration using a QR code!\n\nThe move is part of Malaysia\u2019s efforts to modernise and streamline one of the busiest land crossings in the world. It\u2019s not just about convenience for travellers\u2014it\u2019s also a response to calls from foreign investors keen on smoother travel for their operations in Johor.\n\nMalaysia has already piloted the QR code system and will roll it out to Malaysian citizens starting early next year. By mid-2025, the system is expected to include all passport holders. This announcement follows Singapore\u2019s own plan to introduce passport-free travel at Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints for bus passengers.\n\nIf all goes as planned, travelling between Singapore and Malaysia will become quicker, easier, and more tech-savvy. We can\u2019t wait!\n\n$15.8 billion locked up safe under banks\u2019 \u2018money lock\u2019 feature\n\nSingaporeans take scam prevention seriously. Collectively, there\u2019s been nearly $15.8 billion set aside under the \u201cmoney lock\u201d feature offered by banks across the island. This security option, introduced about a year ago, has seen a significant uptake, with over 181,000 customers using it as of October 31, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\n\nWhat is the \u201cmoney lock\u201d feature? Available at 7 major retail banks, including DBS, OCBC, and UOB, it allows users to lock their funds, making them inaccessible for transfers even if scammers gain access to the account. Withdrawals from locked funds require visiting designated ATMs, creating a critical pause for customers to reflect and potentially recognize a scam attempt.\n\nUptake has been particularly high among those aged 30 to 49, who account for 43% of users, followed closely by individuals above 50 (42%). Customers under 30 make up the remaining 15%. Overall the feature\u2019s definitely been surging in popularity more recently. In just 3 months, the total locked funds rose by 76%, jumping from $9 billion in July to $15.8 billion in October.\n\nIf you\u2019re keen to use the feature but your bank doesn\u2019t have it yet, don\u2019t worry. MAS says more banks are planning to roll out the feature next year, ensuring wider access to this protective tool.\n\nALSO READ: How to Help Someone Who Repeatedly Falls for Scams: It\u2019s Not Just a Money Issue, It\u2019s a Psychological One\n\nManulife launches cancer care and gut microbiome screening initiatives\n\nManulife has just launched 2 new collaborative initiatives to better cancer care and gut microbiome screening in Singapore.

            "article_content": "In 2024, researchers turned up possible evidence of ancient life on Mars, hints that Alzheimer\u2019s disease can spread from person-to-person and a slew of other scientific findings that could be a big deal \u2014 if they\u2019re the real deal.\n\nMartian microbes, maybe\n\nAlien microbes may have once made their home on Mars (SN: 8/24/24, p. 6). In July, NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover uncovered a rock on the Red Planet that sports white spots with black rings laced with iron phosphate (see Page 28). On Earth, such specks have been linked to ancient micro\u00adbial life. But they\u2019re not surefire signs of microbes. The only way to know for certain is to bring the rock back to Earth for closer inspection.\n\nNASA\u2019s Perseverance rover discovered leopard spot\u2013like features in this Martian rock (closeup image shown). On Earth, similar structures are associated with microbial life. MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASA\n\nSparking superconductivity\n\nLight may be the secret ingredient for making superconductors that don\u2019t require frigid conditions. In an experiment, blasting a copper and oxygen compound with a laser caused the material to throw off magnetic fields. That magnetism, the scientists say, is a smoking gun for superconductivity \u2014 the ability to ferry electricity with no resistance (SN: 8/10/24, p. 6). But skeptics contend that those magnetic fields might have arisen from some other, unknown physics.\n\nIn experiments, a compound made of copper and oxygen atoms (blue and red spheres in this illustration) blasted with laser light (red) threw off magnetic fields (blue). This effect signals that the compound transformed into a superconductor, some physicists say. Sebastian Fava, J\u00f6rg M. Harms\n\nAncient engineering\n\nBuilders used a water-powered elevator to construct Egypt\u2019s first pyramid nearly 4,700 years ago, researchers propose (SN: 9/7/24 & 9/21/24, p. 11). That controversial idea is based on a computer model of structures in and around the Step Pyramid of Djoser. Controlling the flow of floodwater in and out of a shaft inside the pyramid could have lifted and lowered a block-hoisting platform, the model shows. But critics argue that occasional rains wouldn\u2019t have supplied enough water to sustain such a system.\n\nAncient workers could have built Egyptian King Djoser\u2019s pyramid (shown) using a water-powered elevator to hoist the heavy stone blocks, a computer simulation suggests. But not all archaeologists are on board with the idea. Anton Petrus/Moment/Getty Images\n\nTectonic shake-up\n\nPlate tectonics got off to an early start in Earth\u2019s history, a rock in South Africa suggests. Layers in the rock bear scars of 3-billion-year-old landslides that may have been caused by an earthquake (SN: 4/6/24, p. 6). That quake, scientists say, could have been triggered by slabs of crust colliding. The finding lends support to the contested idea that plate tectonics dates back more than 2.8 billion years. But other geologists are not convinced that this quake marks the start of global plate tectonics.\n\nLayers of rock at the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa contain hints of a huge earthquake triggered by plate tectonics more than 3 billion years ago. Simon Lamb\n\nMedium size, maximum hype\n\nFor the first time, astronomers may have spotted a midsize black hole in our galaxy (SN: 8/10/24, p. 7). Telescope data suggest that a black hole at least 8,200 times as massive as the sun lurks in the star cluster Omega Centauri. But another study disputes the claim. Instead, the star cluster could harbor a horde of smaller black holes (SN: 8/20/24).\n\nIf a rare midsize black hole truly does lurk in the heart of the Omega Centauri star cluster, it would be the first black hole of its size found in the Milky Way. In this Hubble Space Telescope image, the supposed black hole\u2019s location is marked by the white box. Hubble/ESA, NASA, M. H\u00e4berle/MPIA\n\nTransmissible Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is not contagious in everyday life, but under extremely rare conditions, it may spread from one person to another (SN: 2/24/24, p. 6). Five people who in childhood received contaminated growth hormone injections later developed early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 most likely because the hormones were tainted with amyloid-beta, a protein whose buildup is linked to the disease, researchers say. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether the growth hormones are to blame, other experts note. Perhaps the health conditions that those hormones were meant to treat or other medical procedures led to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s in these patients.\n\nHigh levels of the protein amyloid-beta \u2014 a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 appear orange and purple in this brain scan of a man with the disease. Childhood exposure to the protein via contaminated growth hormone injections may have led the man to develop Alzheimer\u2019s later in life. G. Banerjee et al/Nature Medicine 2024\n\nShedding light on dark energy\n\nDark energy may have gotten even more mysterious. The enigmatic stuff, which makes up the bulk of the cosmos, is generally thought to maintain a constant density. But new observations of 6.4 million galaxies and quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, or DESI, paired with data on exploding stars, cast doubt on that idea. These data more closely fit a model of the universe in which the relationship between dark energy\u2019s density and its pressure changes over time (SN: 5/4/24 & 5/18/24, p. 6). If confirmed, this finding would rewrite the history of the universe. Experts are withholding judgment until DESI completes its survey of over 30 million other galaxies (SN: 12/14/24 & 12/28/24, p. 7)."

            "article_content": "Imagine knowing you\u2019ve already made an important contribution to biomedical research before you\u2019ve even started high school. This is a reality for a young Chicago student who recently found a bacterium that exhibits antibiotic activity and produces a novel compound that slows the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells in the lab. Where did this startling discovery come from? Well, goose poop of course.\n\nThis budding young middle school scientist was part of a community partnership with a local university that engages kids from underrepresented and low-income backgrounds. The team partnered with Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, which allowed them to engage with middle schoolers as part of a 14-week applied science program.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nInequality in educational resources, especially for STEM subjects, has often prevented some students from accessing these fields when they\u2019re older. However, a team from the University of Illinois at Chicago, led by Brian Murphy, has established a partnership that engages such groups at an early stage in their educational development. The hope is that, by providing them with a chance to conduct real, high-quality research, these young students will come to see themselves as scientists and explore related careers in the future.\n\nAs Murphy\u2019s lab is focused on finding antibiotics from natural sources, the students helped scour their local communities for environmental samples. Before someone suggests this was just a way to outsource sample gathering, the students then followed up on the stages of scientific processing, especially for programming a specialized robot that removes bacterial colonies from growth plates and tests them for antibiotic activity.\n\n\u201cAll experiments are performed under the guidance of graduate student or postdoctoral scientist volunteer mentors\u201d, the researchers explain in their study.\n\n\u201cEach student collected 3 samples of their choice from Garfield Park in Chicago, IL. Students pretreated and diluted their samples before plating each one on three different media types [....] While their bacteria incubated, they practiced block programming on LEGO EV3 modules in preparation for robot operation. When their environmental diversity plates exhibited sufficient bacterial growth, students programmed and operated the Hudson Robotics RapidPickMP to pick all distinguishable colonies from their environmental diversity plates and transfer them onto dual-sided agar plate assay (DAPA) bioassay plates.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDuring their search, one student returned with a sample of goose poop that contained a strain of bacteria called Pseudomonas idahonensis \u2013 a species that had previously been isolated from rainbow trout in Idaho (idahonensis means \u201cfrom Idaho). The student, Camarria Williams, and Jonathon Rodriguez, Technology Program Manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, are listed as co-authors of the paper\n\nIt was concluded that this bacterium had antibiotic activity and even produced a completely new-to-science compound. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry, the university researchers were able to determine that orfamide N was not actually responsible for the antibiotic activity observed before. However, the compound did hinder the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells when it was tested in the laboratory.\n\nIt is believed that further testing could reveal additional advantageous properties of this new molecule.\n\nThis project demonstrates that it is possible to combine educational outreach with natural product discovery research while also showing how important it is to develop strong relationships between universities and local communities. In particular, it offers typically under-represented students a chance to be scientists themselves and to make incredible discoveries like this!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGuess we should also thank the goose for providing its poop as well.\n\nThe study is published in the journal ACS Omega."

The specimen, a near-perfectly preserved male, was discovered washed ashore on a South Island beach, marking a monumental moment for both marine science and Maori cultural heritage.\n\nThe dissection revealed fascinating biological details, including nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, and vestigial teeth that provide insights into its evolutionary past. However, the whale's broken jaw and bruising led scientists to believe that head trauma might be the cause of its death, though the exact circumstances remain unknown.\n\nThe collaboration between scientists and local Maori communities was a unique aspect of this project, integrating Indigenous knowledge into the scientific process. Post-dissection, the whale's jawbone and teeth will be preserved by the Maori tribe, with 3D replicas to be displayed in museums. This event underscores New Zealand's status as a whale-stranding hotspot and emphasizes the cultural significance of whales as a taonga, or treasure, to the Maori people.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "Run by the team at orchestration, AI, and automation platform Tines, the Tines library contains pre-built workflows shared by real security practitioners from across the community, all of which are free to import and deploy via the Community Edition of the platform.\n\nTheir bi-annual \"You Did What with Tines?!\" competition highlights some of the most interesting workflows submitted by their users, many of which demonstrate practical applications of large language models (LLMs) to address complex challenges in security operations.\n\nOne recent winner is a workflow designed to automate CrowdStrike RFM reporting. Developed by Tom Power, a security analyst at The University of British Columbia, it uses orchestration, AI and automation to reduce the time spent on manual reporting.\n\nHere, we'll share an overview of the workflow, plus a step-by-step guide for getting it up and running.\n\nThe problem - time-consuming reporting\n\nThe workflow's builder, Tom Power, explains, \"The CrowdStrike Falcon sensor goes into Reduced Functionality Mode (RFM), usually because the operating system (OS) or kernel version is too old or too new for the sensor to support in kernel mode. Every week, SecOps would log into the Falcon console, and filter the host management console for endpoints in RFM for the last week. We would generate the report and download it.\"\n\nThis process provided critical data for identifying kernel updates causing RFM, particularly for Linux endpoints. However, it required the team to manually check whether CrowdStrike had released a new sensor version compatible with the latest kernel updates.\n\n\"The entire process took about 30 minutes each week,\" Tom adds. \"Over the course of a year, that added up to more than 25 hours of time we could have spent on other cybersecurity priorities.\"\n\nThe solution - automated RFM reporting with AI\n\nTom's workflow automates the tracking and reporting of Falcon Sensor RFM across hosts. By leveraging Tines' AI-driven Automatic Mode, it generates custom code to streamline report creation. The workflow not only produces regular, consistent reports but also enables management to monitor trends in RFM occurrences, supporting proactive system health management and faster decision-making.\n\nThe automated workflow eliminates the need for manual reporting by allowing analysts to submit requests via a simple web form. Within minutes, the workflow retrieves data, processes it, and delivers an actionable email report, complete with detailed insights and a CSV attachment.\n\nExample output:\n\nHere's a sample of the auto-generated email and report received by the team:\n\nHere are some of the key benefits of using this workflow:\n\nFrees analysts to focus on high-priority cybersecurity tasks.\n\nReduces manual effort and the potential for human error.\n\nDelivers consistent, reliable reports for improved productivity.\n\nEnhances decision-making by providing real-time insights.\n\nBoosts morale by removing a tedious and repetitive task.\n\nWorkflow overview\n\nTools used:\n\nTines - a workflow orchestration, AI and automation platform that's popular with security teams. It's possible to use the free Community Edition of Tines to build and run this workflow if you don't have a paid account. AI must be enabled on your tenant.\n\nCrowdStrike - endpoint detection and response (EDR) platform. This workflow integrates with CrowdStrike Falcon's API to retrieve data about endpoints in Reduced Functionality Mode (RFM). While Falcon provides robust endpoint visibility, it lacks native automation for recurring RFM reports.\n\nThe workflow is initiated when a web form is submitted, triggering the process to generate CrowdStrike RFM reports.\n\nThe first action retrieves a list of device IDs from CrowdStrike Falcon's API. If the list is larger than what CrowdStrike returns in the first batch, multiple calls are made to paginate through the full list.\n\nOnce all the device details are retrieved, the workflow consolidates them into a single resource. This resource acts as the foundation for analysis, where the number of Linux, Windows, and Mac hosts is calculated and appended to the data.\n\nUsing the consolidated resource, the workflow generates an HTML summary table to present the data in a structured format. This table is then converted into a CSV file, making it suitable for reporting purposes.\n\nThe CSV report is emailed to stakeholders for review. To maintain efficiency and data hygiene, the workflow purges the temporary resource after the email is sent, ensuring it is ready for the next cycle.\n\nBy automating these steps, the workflow eliminates manual effort, reduces the risk of errors, and provides consistent, up-to-date reporting on devices in reduced functionality mode across the environment.\n\nConfiguring the workflow - step-by-step guide\n\nLog into Tines or create a new account. Ensure AI is enabled on your tenant. For this, you need to be the tenant owner. Select the account settings drop-down in the top left of your screen, and check the box to turn AI on. Create your CrowdStrike credential. From the credentials page, select New credential, scroll down to the CrowdStrike credential and complete the required fields. Navigate to the pre-built workflow in the library. Select import. This should take you straight to your new pre-built workflow. Configure your actions. For example, you may like to edit the layout of the Tines page that kicks off the workflow. Test the workflow. Submit an image via the form to test your workflow. Publish your workflow and share the Page URL with your desired users.\n\nBuilding in other automation platforms\n\nYou could use another no-code automation platform to build a similar service, although it's worth noting that some of the features in this workflow are unique to Tines:\n\nPages: This workflow is kicked off by a submission to a form on a web page. This is built using Tines' Pages feature. Alternative: Use a scheduled trigger to kick off the workflow.\n\nThis workflow is kicked off by a submission to a form on a web page.

They lost the NLCS with Soto in 2022, then missed the playoffs entirely in 2023. Rather than go through another round of arbitration with Soto and take him into his walk year, they dealt him and outfielder Trent Grisham to the Yankees on Dec. 7, 2023, for a package of controllable pitchers in Michael King and Jhony Brito, prospects Drew Thorpe and Randy V\u00e1squez, and backup catcher Kyle Higashioka (a package that\u2019s looking strong for San Diego)."

His 261.2 passing yards per game represents his lowest average since 2019, while his 89.0 passer rating is his worst mark since 2014.\n\nCousins' subpar performance is especially worrisome after he signed a massive four-year, $180 million contract to join Atlanta as a free agent in March.\n\nDespite his turnover issues and the Falcons' inconsistent offense, Morris has remained steadfast in his approach to the top quarterback spot on the depth chart.\n\nHe confirmed that Cousins would remain Atlanta's starter following a 42-21 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday.\n\nDianna Russini of The Athletic also reported that the Falcons haven't held any \"internal discussions\" regarding a change at quarterback.\n\nEven though Cousins is expected to retain his status as the starter, Morris also expressed his support for Penix as the team's eventual top signal-caller.\n\n\"I told you right from the beginning, he's our future,\" Morris said on Thursday, per Raimondi.\n\nPenix, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, still appears to have the support of the coaching staff as a long-term option."

            "article_content": "Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 MSRP $279.99 Score Details \u201cCanon's MegaTank Pixma G4280 is an affordable inkjet tank with economical ink, but there are some trade-offs at that price.\u201d Pros Low price for an inkjet tank\n\nIncludes 2 years of ink\n\nInk costs are super low\n\nSetup was quick and easy Cons Slow scanning and printing\n\nLow-contrast plain paper photos\n\nDisplay is small\n\nTable of Contents Table of Contents Specs Design Printing performance Special features Software and compatibility Price Is the Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 worth it?\n\nCanon recently introduced the new MegaTank Pixma G4280 all-in-one, a low-cost inkjet tank printer that refills with bottles instead of cartridges. That means ink lasts much longer and costs significantly less.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nPrice isn\u2019t the only important consideration when you\u2019re shopping for the best printer. I went hands-on with the MegaTank Pixma G4280 to test print quality and speed, make copies, and scan photos to check out the automatic document feeder (ADF) and flatbed scanner.\n\nSpecs\n\nCanon MegaTank Pixma G4280 Dimensions 16.4 x 14.3 x 8.4 inches Weight 16.5 pounds Print speed 11 ppm (black), 6 ppm (color) Copy speed 8 cpm (black), 3.5 cpm (color) Print resolution 4800 x 1200 dpi Scan resolution 600 x 1200 dpi Ports Hi-Speed USB Paper capacity 100 sheets Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, dual band\n\nDesign\n\nThe MegaTank Pixma G4280 is very compact for an all-in-one printer with an ADF. The footprint is 16.4 inches by 14.3 inches and it stands just 8.4 inches high. The weight is 16.5 pounds, so it\u2019s easy to unbox and move around.\n\nThe lightly textured body in off-white works well in a home office and every corner is rounded, softening the appearance. It\u2019s a tank printer, so the ink levels are visible at a glance. The black tank is on the left side of the printer, with cyan, magenta, and yellow on the right.\n\nThe adjustable central control panel tilts up 45 degrees for easy viewing while standing or seated. Canon gave the MegaTank Pixma G4280 a 2.7-inch color touchscreen for easy access to menus. The controls also include buttons to make monochrome or color copies with one touch.\n\nThe main paper tray is in the back and holds 100 sheets. The ADF can handles 35 pages at a time. Overall, it\u2019s a nice design, but paper capacity could be larger.\n\nPrinting performance\n\nThe Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 is fast for short documents, completing the first page in about seven seconds. Inkjet printers don\u2019t have to warm up before starting, so they can beat laser printers in a sprint.\n\nFor longer print jobs, I felt the slowdown. Monochrome prints have a maximum speed of 11 pages per minute (ppm) and color manages just 6 ppm.\n\nA faster inkjet tank like Epson\u2019s EcoTank ET-3850 (16 ppm) or EcoTank Pro ET-5850 (25 ppm) cost more upfront, but offer economical printing without having to wait as long for the prints and copies.\n\nThat said, color and black-and-white documents look professional, and the MegaTank Pixma G4280 supports borderless printing. Fine lines and small print are sharp and easy to read.\n\nPhoto quality is good on glossy paper, but contrast is a little low. That problem is more obvious on plain paper where blacks look gray.\n\nWith tinkering, it\u2019s possible to improve picture quality. For example, selecting Photo Matte as the paper type improves plain paper photo quality.\n\nThere are better photo printers out there, and some are quite affordable.\n\nSpecial features\n\nThere\u2019s an option for duplex in copy settings, but the printer has what Canon calls semi-auto, which means I had to manually reinsert each sheet to complete the scan. It works, but takes time.\n\nIf you need to copy double-sided documents often, Canon\u2019s Maxify GX2020 costs more, but the full-duplex capability will save you a huge amount of time.\n\nThe copy quality is good and relatively fast for a slow printer. There are options to reduce, enlarge, and copy multiple pages to a single sheet, saving paper costs.\n\nThe flatbed scanner captures up to 600 dots per inch (dpi), which is good enough in most cases. For photos and negatives, you might want a dedicated scanner to maintain maximum resolution.\n\nSoftware and compatibility\n\nInstalling the MegaTank Pixma G4280 took about 15 minutes and was quite simple. I plugged in power, scanned the QR code on the printer\u2019s screen to get the app, and pressed the link button to connect Wi-Fi. There\u2019s a USB-B port if you prefer to use a wired connection to a computer.\n\nCanon ships the MegaTank Pixma G4280 with four full ink bottles, including a large supply of cyan, magenta, and yellow, along with a double-sized container of black. The box also contained replaceable black and color printheads.\n\nEverything was clearly marked. I installed the printheads and filled the ink tanks in about two minutes. The printer alerted me that the initial ink priming takes about seven minutes, so I could be productive elsewhere instead of waiting for it to finish.\n\nLike most major brands, Canon printers are easy to connect to Windows PCs and Macs. The Canon Print app allows printing and scanning from mobile devices and Chromebooks.\n\nPrice\n\nCanon\u2019s list price for the MegaTank Pixma G4280 is $280, but the printer is often available for $230. The low upfront price might catch your eye, but the real value is in the ink, which Canon estimates is equal to about $1,000 worth of ink cartridges.\n\nThe included bottles hold enough ink to last up to two years, equivalent to 30 black (PG-260) and color (CL-261) cartridges. That\u2019s the type used in the Canon\u2019s budget-priced Pixma TR7020a inkjet printer.\n\nWith full tanks, the MegaTank Pixma G4280 can print up to 6,000 monochrome pages and 7,700 color pages. Based on current ink prices, that means each color document costs about five-tenths of a cent per page, while black ink costs drop to two-tenths of a cent per page.\n\nIs the Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 worth it?\n\nCanon\u2019s MegaTank Pixma G4280 is inexpensive for an inkjet tank printer, but there are trade-offs to keep the cost that low. It\u2019s slower than cartridge-based inkjets and laser printers and has limited 100-sheet paper capacity. The semi-auto duplex ADF works, but is slow and requires your presence through the entire process.\n\nHowever, if you aren\u2019t in a hurry, the MegaTank Pixma G4280 minimizes ink costs. It handles color document copies and prints nicely. Glossy photo prints also look good.\n\nAll in all, though, there are better all-in-one printers with full-duplex ADFs, and you can save you money on specialty paper costs by choosing the best photo printers, which can print with good quality on plain paper.\n\nThat means Canon\u2019s MegaTank Pixma G4280 could work well in a home office where you aren\u2019t sharing the printer with co-workers, but it\u2019s compromises make it harder to recommend for its intended audience."

            "article_content": "How many people in Gaza have been killed by the Israel-Hamas war? For a long time, the only source of information was the Palestinian Ministry of Health. And the accuracy of their death rolls became the subject of a morbid political debate. Is it fair to call the ministry \"Hamas-run\"? Did they tell the truth about the Ahli Hospital bombing? What to make of the discrepancy between identified and unidentified corpses?\n\nIt's an ethical question not just for Israelis carrying out the war, but also for Americans, who are providing both the funding and weapons that make the war effort possible.\n\nAirwars, a team of conflict researchers affiliated with the University of London, went back and cross-checked the casualty lists from the first 25 days of the Israeli air campaign against news reporting, social media, and other local sources. And unlike the Palestinian ministry, they differentiated between civilians and fighters, using data such as social media funeral notices to determine Hamas affiliation.\n\nThe Airwars report, released on Thursday, shows a rate of civilian slaughter \"incomparable with any 21st century air campaign. It is by far the most intense, destructive, and fatal conflict for civilians that Airwars has ever documented.\" The Palestinian ministry reported 8,525 wartime deaths, including 3,542 children, from October 7, 2023, to October 31, 2023. Airwars was able to verify a minimum of 5,139 civilians killed by Israeli air raids in that timeframe, including at least 1,900 children.\n\nMost of them were not the collateral damage of combat against Hamas. Out of 606 incidents of civilian casualties studied by Airwars, only 26 overlapped with the death of a militant. And in those 26 incidents, the killing was still incredibly lopsided, with 32 militants killed in total, at a cost of 522 civilian lives.\n\nFor example, the Israeli military killed Hamas commander Ibrahim Biari on October 31, 2023, by dropping American-made 2,000-lb bunker buster bombs on the Jabalia refugee camp. The attack also killed at least 126 civilians, including 69 children, according to Airwars. \"Children were carrying other injured children and running, with grey dust filling the air. Bodies were hanging on the rubble, many of them unrecognized. Some were bleeding and others were burnt,\" Palestinian eyewitness Mohammad Al Aswad told CNN at the time.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht called the deaths in Jabalia a \"tragedy of war\" in a CNN interview. \"About the civilians there, we're doing everything we can to minimize. Sadly they [Hamas] are hiding themselves within the civilian population,\" Hecht told CNN. \"We're going to go after every one of these terrorists who was involved in the hideous [October 7, 2023] attack.\"\n\nHamas raided Israeli towns and villages on October 7, 2023, killing 815 civilians, including 36 children, and 380 military personnel. Its fighters shot Israelis and foreigners in their houses, bomb shelters, and music festivals at close range, returning to Gaza with 251 captives, about 96 of whom are still being held hostage. The human rights organization Amnesty International said that Hamas \"flagrantly violated international law and displayed a chilling disregard for human life by carrying out cruel and brutal crimes including mass summary killings, hostage-taking, and launching indiscriminate rocket attacks into Israel.\"\n\nIsraeli leaders promised a counterattack \"with neither limitations nor respite\" on October 8. The Israeli military used artificial intelligence to generate long target lists, both designed to \"kill as many Hamas operatives as possible\" and to \"create a shock\" that will \"lead civilians to put pressure on Hamas,\" intelligence officers told +972 Magazine. Israel also employed a program known as \"Where's Daddy\" designed to kill Hamas members at home with their families, +972 later reported.\n\nThe results were consistent with that kind of strategy. \"Families were killed together in unprecedented numbers, and in their homes,\" the Airwars report states. Over 90 percent of women and children killed by Israeli air raids died in their homes, and in 95 percent of cases where a woman was killed, at least one child was also killed, according to the Airwars report.\n\nAmnesty International concluded last week that the Israeli war in Gaza constitutes a \"genocide against Palestinians\" because \"the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza, as such, was Israel's intent, either in addition to, or as a means to achieve, its military aims.\" Israel denied the allegations. The Amnesty report is \"nothing but accusing us\u2014the victims of this terror\u2014of permitting the genocide which has been committed on our people by Hamas' design,\" Israeli government spokesman David Mercer told Sky News.\n\nThe Airwars report did not come to any conclusion about Israel's intent. It states that the research is only \"intended to cut through the 'fog of war'\u2014to provide an evidence base that offers civilians a route to accountability, to give policy makers the tools they need to make decisions that protect civilians, and to present an accurate and comprehensive picture even in the most contested of battlefields.\"\n\nAirwars was founded in 2014 by Chris Woods, a British journalist with a long career investigating drone warfare, to monitor the consequences of air campaigns around the world. Its current areas of research include the Russian bombing in Ukraine and Syria; U.S. and U.S.-led coalition bombing in Iraq, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen; Turkish bombing in Syrian and Iraqi Kurdistan; and bombing by all sides of the Libyan civil war.\n\nAlthough the Israeli government and its supporters often argue that its military tactics are more humane than the American \"war on terror,\" Airwars found the exact opposite to be true. Before October 2023, the deadliest month for civilians ever recorded by Airwars was March 2017, when a U.S.-led coalition was battling the Islamic State group for Mosul, Iraq. That campaign killed 1,470 civilians, only one-fifth of the verified Palestinian civilian death count in October 2023. Children made up 9 percent of casualties in Mosul overall, and 36 percent of casualties in Gaza in October 2023.\n\nThese numbers are a conservative estimate, based on the minimum reported casualties in cases that Airwars was able to verify were Israeli bombing rather than Hamas misfires. And the study only covers one month of the war. More than a year later, the Palestinian Ministry of Health reports that 45,600 people have been killed and 11,000 are missing. Again, unlike the Airwars report, these numbers don't distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters.\n\nBut with hospitals overwhelmed, communications cut, and thousands of bodies left in the street or trapped under rubble, 45,600 deaths is possibly an undercount. Other researchers have estimated that the total death toll from war, starvation, and disease in Gaza could be greater than 100,000 or even 300,000.\n\nWith all these debates over numbers or legal terminology, it's easy to forget that the Palestinian and Israeli death statistics represent human lives violently cut short. As Jewish scripture states, every human being is an entire world; and as Islamic scripture states, to kill one person is to kill all of humanity."

            "article_content": "If you\u2019ve used a PC extensively, you\u2019ve probably noticed that components often fall short of manufacturer claims. This doesn\u2019t mean you were scammed or bought low-quality hardware \u2013 performance can vary widely depending on usage and environment. This guide explains why the gaps exist, and how to find your PC components\u2019 true performance.\n\nSSD Speed and Endurance\n\nSSDs, whether they are regular SATA SSDs or NVMe, are advertised with a maximum read/write speed and an endurance estimate. For example, a mid-range NVMe SSD could be advertised with 7000 MB/s read/write speeds with 600 TBW (Terabytes Written). However, in practical use, you may only see 3500-5000 MB/s speeds on average, with shorter life as well.\n\nThe manufacturer claims are usually based on ideal conditions, like powerful hardware with no bottlenecks and thermal issues. The data used for the test is also large sequential data blocks, which is easier for the SSD to transfer with minimum latency.\n\nIn real-world usage, you have to process both sequential and random data of different sizes. The SSD will have higher latency, as it has to process different types of data from different memory cells. Furthermore, the associated software, CPU power, PCIe lanes, and motherboard model can also create bottlenecks.\n\nAs for SSD life, even though 600 TBW is calculated under ideal conditions and practical use may yield less, it doesn\u2019t matter for regular users. Most won\u2019t reach 600 TBW, and SSDs typically start facing other issues before reaching 600 or even 300 TBW.\n\nHow to Find True SSD Speed\n\nYou can use a third-party SSD testing tool to learn how your SSD performs on different sets of data. We recommend the CrystalDiskMark program, which is a free Windows app that offers multiple sets of data to test.\n\nAlthough you can change the test parameters for accuracy, the default parameters are fine for most users. Simply click on the All button, and let all four tests run. Check the results in the RND4K Q1T1 section, as it will be closest to day-to-day tasks, while SEQ1M Q8T1 will be closest to manufacturer claims.\n\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t test the actual estimate for SSD TBW endurance. However, you can use a hard drive health-checking tool, like CrystalDiskInfo, to view current SSD health and overall read/write cycles to estimate how much has been used.\n\nLaptop Battery Timing\n\nLaptop manufacturers advertise laptops with battery time in hours, like 10h or 16h battery life. In reality, the battery lasts much less than that \u2013 almost half of the claimed time, or even less.\n\nWhen testing, manufacturers typically play a 1080p local video on repeat, with the laptop power-saving features enabled, low screen brightness, and communication features disabled, like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\n\nHowever, in real-world cases, you\u2019ll probably have all communications enabled, the laptop on balanced power mode, the screen at least above 50% brightness, and running heavier tasks. This greatly decreases the expected battery time \u2013 which could be worse if you are gaming or running a resource-intensive program.\n\nThere could also be heating issues, due to the environment causing laptop fans to work harder to keep the laptop cool.\n\nHow to Find True Laptop Battery Timing\n\nThe easiest way to find the true battery timing of a laptop is to look at online reviews. Most laptops have well-covered reviews from popular review websites that almost always test the battery under real-world usage. Just search for the laptop\u2019s model number, with keywords like \u201cbattery test\u201d or \u201cbattery performance\u201d to find reviews.\n\nHowever, if you want to test it yourself based on your usage, use a battery-tracking app. While great for checking battery estimates, BatteryMon can also help you track complete usage to see how long the battery lasts.\n\nCharge the battery to 100%, unplug the charger, and click on Start graphing in BatteryMon. It will have two lines on the graph, that show the current drop in battery and the estimated drop. Use the laptop as you intend to, and keep the app running until the laptop hibernates due to low battery. Plug it in, and check the graph in BatteryMon that shows how much time it took to reach a low battery level.\n\nMouse Total Clicks\n\nMouse durability is advertised using an average number of clicks that it can sustain, such as 50 million clicks. However, this test is done in a special environment, where the primary click is tested using an actuation machine. The environment is dust- and vibration-free, with the machine putting precise force at fixed intervals. In most cases, only the switch is tested and not the whole mouse.\n\nIn practical use, you\u2019ll probably be using a mouse click with different forces applied from different directions, and you may even drop it. Dirt and handling will also increase wear and tear. Overall, it will give a much lower expected click life than the claims.\n\nTheoretically, if a person clicks 5000 times per day (medium use), then a 50-million clicks mouse should survive 27 years of clicking. Most users report double-clicking issues or other problems with mice within three to five years, so 27 years is rather impossible.\n\nHow to Find True Mouse Click Endurance\n\nCurrently, no tool exists to accurately predict the lifespan of a mouse\u2019s click switches. However, users usually talk about their experience with a mouse and how long it lasted on Reddit and other forums. Search for the mouse\u2019s model, with keywords like, \u201cclick life issue\u201d or \u201cmalfunctioning.\u201d\n\nOf course, they won\u2019t be able to tell how many clicks it took to face issues, but they can give an estimate in months/years.\n\nPower Supply Wattage\n\nPower Supply Units (PSU) have a wattage value along with a supply rating, like 600W 80+ Gold PSU. Although PSUs deliver the advertised wattage, this doesn\u2019t mean you can buy a PSU with the same wattage as your system\u2019s power draw. The PC components may draw more power than expected under heavy load. Additionally, the PSU may deliver less power if the temperature is higher.\n\nIn practical use, this creates a gap between PSU power and the system\u2019s power draw limit \u2013 preventing you from using the same PSU wattage as the system\u2019s power needs. This is why it\u2019s recommended to buy at least 20% to 30% higher wattage PSU compared to the system\u2019s rated power draw. It will ensure PSU can handle unexpected load spikes, power inefficiency, upgrades, and overclocking.\n\nHow to Test Power Supply\n\nIf you are concerned about your system power draw and PSU efficiency, use the OCCT app to test it. OCCT is a stress-testing app that can stress your PSU by forcing the CPU, GPU, storage drive, and RAM to work at maximum power.\n\nIn the app, go to Stability Test -> Power, enable both GPUs (if available), and click on Start at the bottom. Let the test run for at least 30 to 60 minutes to ensure no issues occur. If the system crashes/freezes, or OCCT gives an error, it could mean PSU wattage isn\u2019t enough.\n\nCPU Clock Speed\n\nCPUs have a base and a turbo boost clock speed, like a 3.0 GHz base clock speed with a 4.4 GHz turbo boost clock speed. You can set the PC to maximum performance to make the CPU run at the maximum speed claimed by the manufacturer, but your programs won\u2019t normally utilize all that power.\n\nIn reality, CPUs dynamically adjust their clock speed according to workload, which is why you see lower clock speeds than what the manufacturer claims. Even if you do run a program that can utilize such high speeds, other components can bottleneck the CPU.\n\nThe clock speed utilization depends on the programs you are running, not how fast your CPU can run. Additionally, the clock speed may not reach the maximum limits if the CPU temperature is too high.\n\nHow to Check the Current Clock Speed Utilization\n\nIf you want to know how a program uses the CPU\u2019s power, you can easily check it in the Task Manager. Press the Ctrl + Shift + Esc keys to open the Task Manager, and move to the Performance tab.\n\nYou\u2019ll find the current clock speed in the CPU section, along with a percentage showing how much of that clock speed is being utilized. For example, if the clock speed reads 3.0 GHz with 20% utilization, not only is the system running at a lower clock speed, but only 20% of it is in active use.\n\nBy understanding these differences between real-world results and the manufacturer claims of common PC components, you can make more informed decisions when optimizing the PC or buying a PC.\n\nImage credit: Vecteezy.

            "article_content": "Cloud remains important as ever as AI makes gains in the industry. Other key factors leading to the continued importance of the cloud include the increasing adoption of cloud services by businesses for cost-efficiency and scalability, advancements in cloud technologies, the growth of big data and analytics, and the rising need for remote work solutions.\n\nAccording to a Market.us report, the Global Cloud Computing Market size is expected to be worth around $2,974.6 Billion by 2033 from $629.5 Billion in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 16.8% during the forecast period from 2024 to 2033.\n\nCurrent trends include the rise of hybrid and multi-cloud strategies, increased focus on cloud security and compliance, growth of edge computing, advancements in AI and machine learning integration, and the development of serverless computing.\n\nHere, experts share their predictions for cloud in 2025:\n\nIn the wake of major vendor outages such as CrowdStrike, CIOs and regulators are both focusing on cloud concentration risk: Truly business-critical applications need to be resilient against both regional and cloud-wide failures, which requires a fully distributed database architecture supporting seamless failover from one cloud region to another, even across clouds. Expect regulators to start scrutinizing cloud provider dependencies at the application level.\u2014Phillip Merrick, co-founder and CEO of pgEdge\n\nThanks to AI, hybrid cloud is here to stay: Only about two years ago, it was a very \u201ccloud only\u201d environment with some companies ready to get rid of their data centers altogether. The reality is, many businesses still have over half their data living outside of the cloud\u2014and it will likely stay there based on what makes the most sense for their use case (in high stakes environments such as healthcare, for example). Therefore, hybrid cloud strategies are alive and well, especially with the proliferation of AI. Organizations can maintain on-premises GPU infrastructure for consistent, high-priority workloads while using cloud GPUs for burst capacity. This avoids complete lock-in to cloud providers' premium GPU pricing and grants better control over total cost of ownership for expensive AI infrastructure.\u2014Haseeb Budhani, CEO and co-founder of Rafay Systems\n\nGreenOps will grab a greater foothold: Statistics show that the public cloud now has a larger carbon footprint than even the airline industry, and a single public data center uses as much electricity as 50,000 homes. Amid new regulations, particularly in Europe, coupled with consumer pressure, we predict more interest in the concept of GreenOps. Put simply, GreenOps is the practice of minimizing a cloud environment\u2019s carbon footprint by efficiently using cloud resources. This can only be done with visibility into an organization\u2019s true cloud spend and a deeper understanding of how resources are allocated. Optimizing cloud use to reduce waste will be a key part of this puzzle, leading organizations and individuals to take a closer look at their data usage.\u2014CloudZero's SVP of Engineering Bill Buckley\n\nCloud-only analytics fade as enterprises shift to cost-effective, predictable solutions: Enterprises are on the verge of a major shift in their approach to data analytics, as cloud-only solutions face increasing scrutiny due to opaque billing practices from providers, often leading to unexpected expenses that undermine financial planning. Currently, more than half of companies identify cloud spend as a top concern, yet lack the visibility needed to truly control or optimize these costs. Without clear insights into actual usage and application requirements, businesses are essentially \"driving blind,\" much like driving without a gauge for fuel mileage. In the next 12-18 months, this lack of transparency is likely to drive a substantial movement toward hybrid and alternative models that promise greater predictability and control. Until cloud providers deliver the transparency needed for accurate spending oversight, cloud-only models will take a back seat as businesses seek sustainable, controlled solutions that allow them to manage and optimize their usage effectively.\u2014Ocient CEO Chris Gladwin\n\nCloud value optimization: The focus will shift from \"cloud-first\" to \"cloud-right\" as organizations demand deeper insights into workload economics across their entire cloud fabric. Understanding unit costs - especially in private cloud environments\u2014will become crucial for strategic decision-making. We'll see the emergence of new metrics and KPIs designed specifically to measure cloud ROI and effectiveness across hybrid environments.\u2014Kyle Campos, chief technology and product officer, cloudbolt\n\nScalability and agility demands will push cloud-native analytics to the forefront: By 2025, cloud-native architectures will be the go-to choice for businesses looking to keep pace with the need for agility and scalability. As intelligence-supported decision-making takes center stage across industries, cloud-native analytics will lead the way. Companies are increasingly adopting multi-cloud strategies to maintain flexibility and avoid vendor lock-in, and analytics platforms will need to support seamless interoperability across different cloud providers. Users will look for hyperscale-neutral solutions that integrate effortlessly with major players like AWS, GCP, and Azure, while also handling AI/ML/Generative workloads with ease. Cloud-native is set to become the foundation for analytics in the next phase of business intelligence.\u2014Trevor Schulze, chief digital and information officer at Alteryx"

The publication contributed the article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.\n\nWe have only one example of biology forming in the universe \u2013 life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don\u2019t know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth . Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI\u2019m an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology . Through my research, I\u2019ve learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there\u2019s advanced alien life out there, I\u2019m on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars , have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2013 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it\u2019s a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don\u2019t agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \u201cself-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\u201d That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nEvolution vs Natural Selection - YouTube Watch On\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet\u2019s atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA\u2019s definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2013 biological or not \u2013 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nMinerals are an example of a nonliving system that has increased in diversity and complexity over billions of years. (Image credit: UNM Newsroom)\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism\u2019s genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life\u2019s essential molecules \u2013 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they\u2019re unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they\u2019ll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth\u2019s crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system , or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that\u2019s for life as we know it \u2013 for life as we don\u2019t know it, all bets are off.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.

For generations, New Jersey has played host to stories of the strange and the surreal, including Martian invasions and ghostly treasure guardians.\n\nWas a UFO seen in NJ in 1966?\n\nOne of the most famous stories came on a 1966 cold, clear winter evening in Wanaque, when residents reported seeing mysterious lights hovering over the Wanaque Reservoir. The event, which would later be recounted as one of New Jersey\u2019s most famous UFO sightings, involved numerous witnesses, including police officers and town officials. All described a strange, glowing object moving in inexplicable ways.\n\nThe first reports came around 6:30 p.m. Patrolman Joseph Cisco, responding to a dispatch about a glowing light, spotted what he described as a pulsating orb, larger than a star, hovering silently in the sky. Other calls quickly followed, with sightings reported in Ringwood, Paterson and Oakland.\n\nWanaque Mayor Harry Wolfe, along with Councilmen Warren Hagstrom and Arthur Barton, happened to be nearby and joined Cisco at the scene. The mayor\u2019s 14-year-old son, Billy Wolfe, identified the object, describing it as a brilliant, steady light changing colors from white to red to green.\n\nThe intensity of the incident escalated as additional witnesses claimed to see the light interact with the frozen reservoir. Civil Defense Director Bentley Spencer reported seeing a beam of light shoot down toward the ice, which some described as \"burning a hole.\" Reservoir worker Fred Steines confirmed the unusual activity at the dam. Other witnesses described the object as disc-shaped or oval.\n\nThe following night, Patrolman Jack Wardlaw reported seeing a similar object near his home in Stonetown moving erratically and disappearing over nearby mountains. By October 1966, more sightings followed, including one from Sgt. Ben Thompson, who described a glowing object moving low over the mountains before accelerating upward.\n\nVarious explanations were offered in the years that followed. A study by Vestigia in 1979 theorized that seismic activity near the Ramapo fault might have caused luminous phenomena, while the Pentagon suggested a rare celestial alignment of Venus and Jupiter. Eyewitnesses, however, rejected these theories and the events remain unexplained.\n\nA UFO hoax perpetrated in NJ in 2009\n\nLike many of New Jersey's more unbelievable stories, another UFO mystery turned out to be a hoax. It started in January 2009 in Morristown, when five red lights appeared in the night sky. Dubbed the \"Morristown UFO,\" these lights sparked widespread speculation about extraterrestrial activity, with some residents and UFO enthusiasts convinced they were witnessing a genuine sighting when they reportedly saw them hover in a triangular formation before moving across the sky.\n\nHowever, on April 1, 2009, two young men, Joe Rudy and Chris Russo \u2014 now a Morristown councilman \u2014 revealed that the event was a carefully orchestrated hoax.\n\nUsing helium balloons and road flares, they had staged the \"UFO\" as a social experiment to highlight the unreliability of eyewitness testimony and the sensationalism surrounding UFO investigations. They released videos documenting their process, which debunked theories of advanced aircraft or alien visitation and underscored how easily UFO stories could gain traction without substantial evidence.\n\nA witch trial in New Jersey?\n\nNew Jersey's strange happenings and hoaxes date back centuries. In 1730, an account emerged in the Pennsylvania Gazette about New Jersey's only alleged witch trial.\n\nDrawing a crowd of 300 villagers, the trial was reportedly held in Mount Holly to determine the fate of two residents accused of casting spells on a neighbor\u2019s livestock. The spells allegedly caused the sheep to dance and the hogs to sing psalms.\n\nThe story ended without a definitive conclusion and its veracity was never confirmed or truly debunked. Many historians, however, have claimed newspaper publisher and Founding Father Benjamin Franklin devised the article as a satire meant to criticize superstition and possibly poke fun at residents of Burlington County.\n\nA prank by New Jersey's P.T. Barnum\n\nFranklin's Mount Holly hoax set the stage for New Jersey\u2019s reputation as a fertile ground for pranks. That ground in 1843 would be trodden by famous prankster P.T. Barnum, who with a bombardment of posters promised residents of New York City a summertime display like none other across the Hudson River.\n\nThe ads claimed Hoboken would host a thrilling \"Grand Buffalo Hunt\" on Aug. 31. Cowboys were to showcase their lasso skills on a herd of American bison brought from the untamed West. Best of all, the event was free. Thousands ultimately made the journey, according to the 1995 book \"P.T. Barnum: America's Greatest Showman.\"\n\nBarnum, in his biography, described partnering with ferry operators to get half of the day's fares. The gamble paid off spectacularly. More than 20,000 people reportedly crossed to Hoboken. By day\u2019s end, Barnum had cleared a profit of $3,500, a windfall for the era.\n\nInstead of powerful beasts, attendees were greeted by a motley collection of frail buffalo that Barnum purchased for $700. Making matters worse was weak fencing that allowed frightened bison to break through the arena holding the event and flee into the nearby swamps.\n\nHidden Revolutionary War treasure ghost in NJ? No!\n\nA legend of British Loyalists burying treasure as they fled George Washington\u2019s forces during the Revolutionary War led another hoax perpetrator to bring fright to the Morristown area. Ransford Rodgers, a former Connecticut schoolteacher, arrived in the area in the late 1780s claiming he could unlock the mystery of the fabled treasure many believed was hidden on Schooley Mountain.\n\nRodgers wove an enticing narrative, insisting that the treasure's location was protected by a ghost, as detailed in Peter Zablocki's recent book \"The 1788 Morristown Ghost Hoax. This spirit, Rodgers claimed, could only be exorcised with his specialized skills.\n\nProminent families in Morristown, entranced by the promise of both riches and adventure, were extorted for large sums of money. Rodgers' elaborate ruse, complete with staged supernatural encounters and spiritual ceremonies, duped the town\u2019s elite before it all unraveled and Rodgers fled the area.\n\nMundane and dumb hoaxes that happened in New Jersey\n\nHeadline-making hoaxes in the 20th century generally included fake kidnappings, deaths and, in the century's second half, bomb scares.\n\nThere were the mundane hoaxes, including one involving taxicab owner William A. Carlock from Pearl River, New York, who claimed to be held up by three armed and masked bandits in Park Ridge in November 1939. In reality, it was Carlock's attempt to steal revenue intended for a coach company so he could pay off his debt.\n\nThere were also the dumb ones, including the one involving the fake merchant seaman hero from Dumont. At 16, William E. Jerlat left home to work odd jobs between Albany and New Orleans before returning home in April 1942 with claims he had joined the U.S. Maritime Service and twice cheated death, The Record reported in September 1943.\n\nThe first time, Jerlat said the merchant freighter he was on was attacked and he went overboard with his hair on fire to save a shipmate. The second time, he said U-boats attacked his ship and he somehow woke up in Africa. The claims were later debunked and investigated by U.S. Naval Intelligence.\n\nAnother hoax took place in April 1981 at the Veterans Administration hospital in East Orange, where an alleged gunman dressed as a doctor purportedly threatened to kill state Sen. James Wallwork. The hospital\u2019s chief of police, Joseph Lancellotti, claimed to have wrestled the would-be assailant to the ground, but said the individual managed to escape. However, an FBI investigation soon revealed that the entire incident was a hoax orchestrated by Lancellotti.\n\nNew Jersey's most famous hoax\n\nMost prominently, New Jersey played host to one of the most famous hoaxes of all time.\n\nOn Halloween Eve in 1938, the Garden State became the epicenter of mass hysteria, thanks to Orson Welles' infamous radio broadcast of \"The War of the Worlds.\" For listeners across America, the mock news reports describing a Martian invasion felt chillingly real. But for residents of Grovers Mill, a small community in West Windsor, the drama hit far too close to home.\n\nThe broadcast, performed by Welles and the Mercury Theatre on the Air, reimagined H.G. Wells\u2019 1898 novel as a live event. Interspersed between music segments, faux news bulletins described explosions on Mars followed by a Martian landing in Grovers Mill. With its realistic tone, the broadcast sparked chaos. Traffic jams clogged the streets, phones rang off the hook and panic swept across the nation.\n\nOne Grovers Mill resident, William Dock, reportedly fired shots at a water tower in the moonlight, mistaking it for a Martian war machine. Families packed their belongings and fled in search of safety, while others drove into the hamlet, hoping to catch a glimpse of the alien invaders.\n\nBob Sanders, then 6 years old, recalled the surreal scene in a 2013 interview with USA Today. \"Fathers put their families in a car and took off for parts unknown,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cOther people came to see what they [the Martians] looked like.\u201d\n\nFor some, the simulated invasion seemed far too real. In Newark, dozens of families fled their homes, believing a gas attack was underway. The New York Times reported widespread disruption, with households and religious services interrupted, roads gridlocked and communication lines overwhelmed.\n\nWelles' inspiration reportedly came from the Hindenburg disaster of 1937. His team mimicked the measured tones of news announcers and fueled the staged panic's believability."

            "article_content": "In 2024, researchers turned up possible evidence of ancient life on Mars, hints that Alzheimer\u2019s disease can spread from person-to-person and a slew of other scientific findings that could be a big deal \u2014 if they\u2019re the real deal.\n\nMartian microbes, maybe\n\nAlien microbes may have once made their home on Mars (SN: 8/24/24, p. 6). In July, NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover uncovered a rock on the Red Planet that sports white spots with black rings laced with iron phosphate (see Page 28). On Earth, such specks have been linked to ancient micro\u00adbial life. But they\u2019re not surefire signs of microbes. The only way to know for certain is to bring the rock back to Earth for closer inspection.\n\nNASA\u2019s Perseverance rover discovered leopard spot\u2013like features in this Martian rock (closeup image shown). On Earth, similar structures are associated with microbial life. MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASA\n\nSparking superconductivity\n\nLight may be the secret ingredient for making superconductors that don\u2019t require frigid conditions. In an experiment, blasting a copper and oxygen compound with a laser caused the material to throw off magnetic fields. That magnetism, the scientists say, is a smoking gun for superconductivity \u2014 the ability to ferry electricity with no resistance (SN: 8/10/24, p. 6). But skeptics contend that those magnetic fields might have arisen from some other, unknown physics.\n\nIn experiments, a compound made of copper and oxygen atoms (blue and red spheres in this illustration) blasted with laser light (red) threw off magnetic fields (blue). This effect signals that the compound transformed into a superconductor, some physicists say. Sebastian Fava, J\u00f6rg M. Harms\n\nAncient engineering\n\nBuilders used a water-powered elevator to construct Egypt\u2019s first pyramid nearly 4,700 years ago, researchers propose (SN: 9/7/24 & 9/21/24, p. 11). That controversial idea is based on a computer model of structures in and around the Step Pyramid of Djoser. Controlling the flow of floodwater in and out of a shaft inside the pyramid could have lifted and lowered a block-hoisting platform, the model shows. But critics argue that occasional rains wouldn\u2019t have supplied enough water to sustain such a system.\n\nAncient workers could have built Egyptian King Djoser\u2019s pyramid (shown) using a water-powered elevator to hoist the heavy stone blocks, a computer simulation suggests. But not all archaeologists are on board with the idea. Anton Petrus/Moment/Getty Images\n\nTectonic shake-up\n\nPlate tectonics got off to an early start in Earth\u2019s history, a rock in South Africa suggests. Layers in the rock bear scars of 3-billion-year-old landslides that may have been caused by an earthquake (SN: 4/6/24, p. 6). That quake, scientists say, could have been triggered by slabs of crust colliding. The finding lends support to the contested idea that plate tectonics dates back more than 2.8 billion years. But other geologists are not convinced that this quake marks the start of global plate tectonics.\n\nLayers of rock at the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa contain hints of a huge earthquake triggered by plate tectonics more than 3 billion years ago. Simon Lamb\n\nMedium size, maximum hype\n\nFor the first time, astronomers may have spotted a midsize black hole in our galaxy (SN: 8/10/24, p. 7). Telescope data suggest that a black hole at least 8,200 times as massive as the sun lurks in the star cluster Omega Centauri. But another study disputes the claim. Instead, the star cluster could harbor a horde of smaller black holes (SN: 8/20/24).\n\nIf a rare midsize black hole truly does lurk in the heart of the Omega Centauri star cluster, it would be the first black hole of its size found in the Milky Way. In this Hubble Space Telescope image, the supposed black hole\u2019s location is marked by the white box. Hubble/ESA, NASA, M. H\u00e4berle/MPIA\n\nTransmissible Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is not contagious in everyday life, but under extremely rare conditions, it may spread from one person to another (SN: 2/24/24, p. 6). Five people who in childhood received contaminated growth hormone injections later developed early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 most likely because the hormones were tainted with amyloid-beta, a protein whose buildup is linked to the disease, researchers say. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether the growth hormones are to blame, other experts note. Perhaps the health conditions that those hormones were meant to treat or other medical procedures led to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s in these patients.\n\nHigh levels of the protein amyloid-beta \u2014 a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 appear orange and purple in this brain scan of a man with the disease. Childhood exposure to the protein via contaminated growth hormone injections may have led the man to develop Alzheimer\u2019s later in life. G. Banerjee et al/Nature Medicine 2024\n\nShedding light on dark energy\n\nDark energy may have gotten even more mysterious. The enigmatic stuff, which makes up the bulk of the cosmos, is generally thought to maintain a constant density. But new observations of 6.4 million galaxies and quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, or DESI, paired with data on exploding stars, cast doubt on that idea. These data more closely fit a model of the universe in which the relationship between dark energy\u2019s density and its pressure changes over time (SN: 5/4/24 & 5/18/24, p. 6). If confirmed, this finding would rewrite the history of the universe. Experts are withholding judgment until DESI completes its survey of over 30 million other galaxies (SN: 12/14/24 & 12/28/24, p. 7)."

            "article_content": "Life is an anthology of destruction. Everything you build eventually breaks. Everyone you love will die. Any sense of order or stability inevitably crumbles. The entire universe follows a dismal trek toward a dull state of ultimate turmoil.\n\nTo keep track of this cosmic decay, physicists employ a concept called entropy. Entropy is a measure of disorderliness, and the declaration that entropy is always on the rise \u2014 known as the second law of thermodynamics \u2014 is among nature\u2019s most inescapable commandments.\n\nI have long felt haunted by the universal tendency toward messiness. Order is fragile. It takes months of careful planning and artistry to craft a vase but an instant to demolish it with a soccer ball. We spend our lives struggling to make sense of a chaotic and unpredictable world, where any attempt to establish control seems only to backfire. The second law demands that machines can never be perfectly efficient, which implies that whenever structure arises in the universe, it ultimately serves only to dissipate energy further \u2014 be it a star that eventually explodes or a living organism converting food into heat. We are, despite our best intentions, agents of entropy.\n\n\u201cNothing in life is certain except death, taxes and the second law of thermodynamics,\u201d wrote Seth Lloyd, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There\u2019s no sidestepping this directive. The growth of entropy is deeply entwined with our most basic experiences, accounting for why time runs forward and why the world appears deterministic rather than quantum mechanically uncertain.\n\nBut despite its fundamental importance, entropy is perhaps the most divisive concept in physics. \u201cEntropy has always been a problem,\u201d Lloyd told me. The confusion stems in part from the way the term gets tossed and twisted between disciplines \u2014 it has similar but distinct meanings in everything from physics to information theory to ecology. But it\u2019s also because truly wrapping one\u2019s head around entropy requires taking some deeply uncomfortable philosophical leaps.\n\nAs physicists have worked to unite seemingly disparate fields over the past century, they have cast entropy in a new light \u2014 turning the microscope back on the seer and shifting the notion of disorder to one of ignorance. Entropy is seen not as a property intrinsic to a system but as one that\u2019s relative to an observer who interacts with that system. This modern view illuminates the deep link between information and energy, which is now helping to usher in a mini-industrial revolution on the smallest of scales.\n\nTwo hundred years after the seeds of entropy were first sown, what\u2019s emerging is a conception of this quantity that\u2019s more opportunistic than nihilistic. The conceptual evolution is upending the old way of thinking, not just about entropy, but about the purpose of science and our role in the universe.\n\nThe Motive Power of Fire\n\nSadi Carnot at age 17. Louis-Le\u0301opold Boilly\n\nThe notion of entropy grew out of an attempt at perfecting machinery during the industrial revolution. A 28-year-old French military engineer named Sadi Carnot set out to calculate the ultimate efficiency of the steam-powered engine. In 1824, he published a 118-page book titled Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, which he sold on the banks of the Seine for 3 francs. Carnot\u2019s book was largely disregarded by the scientific community, and he died several years later of cholera. His body was burned, as were many of his papers. But some copies of his book survived, and in them lay the embers of a new science of thermodynamics \u2014 the motive power of fire.\n\nCarnot realized that the steam engine is, at its core, a machine that exploits the tendency for heat to flow from hot objects to cold ones. He drew up the most efficient engine conceivable, instituting a bound on the fraction of heat that can be converted to work, a result now known as Carnot\u2019s theorem. His most consequential statement comes as a caveat on the last page of the book: \u201cWe should not expect ever to utilize in practice all the motive power of combustibles.\u201d Some energy will always be dissipated through friction, vibration, or another unwanted form of motion. Perfection is unattainable.\n\nReading through Carnot\u2019s book a few decades later, in 1865, the German physicist Rudolf Clausius coined a term for the proportion of energy that\u2019s locked up in futility. He called it \u201centropy,\u201d after the Greek word for transformation. He then laid out what became known as the second law of thermodynamics: \u201cThe entropy of the universe tends to a maximum.\u201d\n\nPhysicists of the era erroneously believed that heat was a fluid (called \u201ccaloric\u201d). Over the following decades, they realized heat was rather a byproduct of individual molecules bumping around. This shift in perspective allowed the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann to reframe and sharpen the idea of entropy using probabilities."

            "article_content": "EMBL's scientists have been instrumental in helping the world understand, decode, archive, and manipulate genomes at scale and across many branches of the evolutionary tree\n\nBy Ewan Birney, Eileen Furlong, and Arnaud Krebs\n\nIn 1978, British biochemist Frederick Sanger's team released the genome sequence of \u03d5X174 - a virus that infects bacteria. The sequence - the five thousand or so nucleotide 'letters' that make up the instruction manual that is this virus's genome - represented a remarkable feat, especially since DNA sequencing was still a young technique at the time. The development of DNA sequencing methods would bring Sanger his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry two years later.\n\nSince then, the field of genomics has grown by leaps and bounds, and throughout this exponential revolution, EMBL has played a pivotal role, one which it continues to expand on today.\n\nOn sequences and sequencers\n\nOne of the pioneers of the field, Wilhelm Ansorge, joined EMBL in 1979 as a group leader and later became Head of the Functional Genomics Technology Unit. His group developed several methods for increasing the speed and accuracy of DNA sequencing, as well as the first automated fluorescence DNA sequencing system for large genomics DNA. Some of these methods were used later for the Human Genome Project - the large-scale international project which released the first sequence of the human genome in 2003. Ansorge's team also participated in sequencing the genomes of yeast, mouse, mosquito, and a plant called Arabidopsis, often used as a model organism by biologists.\n\nCumulative and rapid advances in methods for DNA sequencing resulted in the arrival of next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods in the late 1990s and 2000s, which relied on carrying out huge numbers of sequencing reactions in parallel and then putting the sequences together by aligning them where they overlapped. Companies such as Roche, Solexa, and Illumina entered the field with commercial sequencing machines which could analyse and sequence genomes with ever-growing speed and accuracy, at larger scales and lower costs than older technologies.\n\nEMBL was one of the first European research institutes to take advantage of this rapid technological progress. By 2001, it had set up the genomics core facility, GeneCore - then a Sanger sequencing and microarray provider, led by biochemist Vladimir Benes, who still heads the facility today. GeneCore was one of the first facilities in Europe to embrace the new sequencing methods, adapting and making them available to researchers across Europe as a service. Today, it is an advanced next-generation sequencing platform, providing end-to-end support to users from across its member states, as well as globally, in their genomics projects.\n\nA parallel revolution in data\n\nThe growing number of DNA sequences also created a demand for computational support to deal with the resulting data deluge. In 1980, EMBL founded the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library, the first central depository of nucleotide sequence data in the world. Under Graham Cameron's leadership, this later developed into the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), established in 1994 and located on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, UK.\n\nSince then EMBL-EBI has developed and made available systematic annotations of genomes with flagship projects such as ENSEMBL, providing a roadmap for scientists to probe genome functions. This initiative - which allowed scientists to view and annotate genomes, identifying the location of genes and non-coding regions - was born in 1999, and then headed by Ewan Birney, currently the Deputy Director General of EMBL and Director of EMBL-EBI. Moreover, EMBL-EBI was a pioneer in the development of repositories for scientists to deposit their data, ArrayExpress for microarray data being an early example. These initiatives transformed the way we do science, as they promoted the reuse of datasets in different contexts, improving reproducibility and speeding up discovery. More EMBL achievements in the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology are discussed here.\n\nUnderstanding the biology of the genome\n\nGenome sequences, databases, and annotations provide scientists with a roadmap to decipher how the genome functions. Microarrays and next generation sequencing enabled the measurement of molecules, and their regulation, at a scale that wasn't possible before. It allows scientists to ask fundamental questions such as, how does the cell maintain, replicate, and decode its genome in order to perform its many functions and adapt rapidly to changes? EMBL's Genome Biology Unit tries to answer these questions. Headed by Senior Scientist Eileen Furlong since 2009, the Unit uses various systems-level approaches to unravel the complex processes involved in regulating the cell's information flow from DNA, RNA, to proteins, integrating cutting-edge experimental and computational approaches and working across scales.\n\nOne of the central challenges of genome biology is to understand which parts of the genome are transcribed into mRNA with various cellular functions. Ansorge's pioneering work allowed researchers for the first time to detect mRNA transcripts using a microarray chip - a small device that can help scientists simultaneously measure the expression levels of all genes in a sample. This groundbreaking technology later allowed the group of Lars Steinmetz to show that large parts of eukaryotic genomes, even outside of genes, are transcribed into RNA. Following this, Steve Cohen's group was one of the first to identify a function for a particular type of non-genic transcripts - microRNAs - in regulating the expression of other genes.\n\nExpression of a gene is controlled by the interplay of multiple molecular mechanisms, many of which were identified at EMBL. Inside cells, DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones in a structure called chromatin. The shape and structure of chromatin help regulate how easily key proteins called transcriptional activators can access their target genes, which, in turn, regulates gene expression. EMBL researchers made several key contributions in identifying and understanding the mode of action of molecular machines that regulate chromatin structure. For instance, Asifa Akhtar and Peter Becker were the first to discover and characterise a chromatin modifier that controls differences in gene expression between male and female fruit flies.\n\nJurg M\u00fcller's Group discovered the enzymatic function of PCR1, one of the key regulators of the genes that control organismal development. These include the Hox-gene cluster, whose role in regulating fruit fly development was discovered at EMBL by Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus, and which was later shown to also be central for mammalian development by EMBL alumnus Denis Duboule.\n\nEMBL researchers have also pioneered the study of 'cis-regulatory elements' - the DNA switches that turn genes on and off. This has been the focus of Eileen Furlong's lab for the last two decades, producing a breadth of studies ranging from developing the methods to map the binding of transcription factors across the genome, to predicting their activity and uncovering the first map of the cis-regulatory elements at the level of an entire organism by pushing the boundaries of single cell genomics.\n\nIn addition, research at EMBL is highly interdisciplinary, and while genome function has been dissected using sequencing techniques, genome regulation processes have also been deciphered from a molecular perspective using structural methods, with multiple research groups providing key insights into the structure-function relationships of enzymes involved in genomic function, such as work from Christoph M\u00fcller's group on RNA polymerase or chromatin remodelling complexes.\n\nEMBL has also led the way in developing, validating, and distributing computational tools to analyse gene expression. For example, the software package DESeq (and its successor DESeq2) created by Wolfgang Huber's team is one of the most widely used packages to identify changes in the expression of genes or their regulators.\n\nFrom the DNA code to human health, biodiversity, and more\n\nThe study of genomes has opened up exciting possibilities for improving human health and helping solve global challenges. One area of progress has been the study of microbiomes - all the microorganisms that inhabit a given environment. Rapid sequencing of DNA in representative environmental samples can give us a snapshot of all the microorganisms living in it, creating a 'metagenome'. This method has been used successfully by EMBL researchers to investigate microbiomes in diverse contexts, e.g. those living in soil or in our guts, and the effect of factors like antibiotics on them. EMBL Heidelberg's Bork Group was one of the pioneers of metagenomics and microbiome sequencing and developed many of the tools that are widely used in this field today. Research by several groups at EMBL (Typas, Patil, Bork) has also shown that our gut microbiome influences how efficiently drugs can act and modulate the risk for certain diseases.\n\nThe Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project also deserves a special mention here. This project involved more than 1300 scientists and clinicians from 37 countries, who analysed more than 2600 genomes of 38 different tumour types, creating a huge resource of primary cancer genomes. This was co-led by Jan Korbel, and the starting point for many working groups across the world to study and provide novel insights regarding the early evolution of cancer, the mutational processes acting in tumours, and the genes active during distinct stages of tumour progression.\n\nGenomic databases and studies are crucial for the progress of genomic medicine - the use of genomics-based technologies such as DNA sequencing to support healthcare. EMBL, particularly EMBL-EBI, contributes strongly in this regard via collaborations with initiatives such as Genomics England and the Nordic EMBL Partnership . EMBL is currently supporting Genomic Medicine initiatives across Europe, including in the UK, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, and Norway. The European Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project brings many of these projects together. EMBL also plays a crucial role in empowering the scientific community by organising a number of meetings, conferences, workshops, and courses around genomics, focusing on both experimental work and data analysis.\n\nAs we head into the next 50 years of genomics, it is interesting to speculate on the future of the field. New strides are already being made in the fields of single-cell omics, where DNA, RNA, and the regulation of RNA transcription can be studied at the level of single cells, and even from intact tissues and organs. These studies provide new insights into a cell's state in any given condition and how that compares to other cell types in the same organ or organism. Such technologies reveal changes during development and disease and are currently being used by EMBL scientists to understand how embryonic development is impacted by genetic and environmental variation, as well as to understand changes during cancer progression. Cancer is caused by multiple changes in DNA, and EMBL scientists currently collaborate with oncologists at Heidelberg University to pinpoint which DNA changes are the most detrimental and to understand how they function.\n\nLarge-scale perturbations of the genome are also giving researchers bigger tools than ever before to understand genome function in precise detail. Moreover, the emergence of methods to synthesise and edit entire genomes, at least for smaller organisms, will revolutionise our ability to understand and modify the functionalities of genomes. The growth of spatial-omics - the integration of imaging with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics technologies - and the use of AI-based systems for analysing genomic codes and predicting gene locations might soon provide a holistic view on genome function. Finally, we are seeing a revolution in the processing of genomes from environmental samples, such as those collected during the Traversing European Coastlines (TREC) expedition , leading not only to a better understanding of global biodiversity but also a clearer picture of the effect of our changing climate and human endeavours.\n\nLearn more about EMBL's contribution to life science research and services in our 50th anniversary commemorative publication."
