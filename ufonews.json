        "article_content": "The ability to build your first Apple iOS app is now even easier, thanks to the power of artificial intelligence (AI). The process of creating a simple yet effective habit-tracking app using AI tools, specifically Cursor AI, requires no prior programming skills. As the AI-generated code and natural language processing, enables you to develop a fully functional app with ease, opening up a world of possibilities for aspiring app developers. In the video below Alex Finn takes you through the process step-by-step in just 7 minutes.\n\nGetting Started\n\nTo begin your app development journey, the first step is to download and install Xcode from the App Store. Xcode is Apple\u2019s official integrated development environment (IDE) and is essential for building iOS applications. Once you have successfully installed Xcode, create a new iOS project and give it a meaningful name, such as \u201cHabit Tracker.\u201d This initial setup forms the foundation of your app, allowing you to focus on designing an intuitive user interface and implementing key features rather than getting bogged down in complex coding tasks.\n\nSimplifying App Development with AI\n\nThe next step is to download and open Cursor AI, a powerful tool that simplifies the app creation process through AI-powered code generation. By opening your project folder in Cursor AI, you can start building your app without writing a single line of code. This innovative tool enables you to use plain English prompts to generate the necessary code, making app development more intuitive and accessible to beginners and experienced developers alike.\n\nNatural Language Processing: Cursor AI uses advanced natural language processing techniques to understand your prompts and generate appropriate code snippets.\n\nCursor AI uses advanced natural language processing techniques to understand your prompts and generate appropriate code snippets.

Iterative Development: With Cursor AI, you can easily modify and expand your app\u2019s functionality by adding new prompts, allowing for rapid iteration and improvement.\n\nBuild Your first iOS App With AI\n\nHere are a selection of other articles from our extensive library of content you may find of interest on the subject of AI apps :\n\nBuilding A Habit Tracker iOS App: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nWith Cursor AI at your disposal, adding features to your habit-tracking app becomes a breeze. Start by creating an input field and a plus sign button for users to add new habits they want to track. To make tracking progress more engaging, incorporate a checkbox feature that allows users to mark habits as completed. Consider adding a delightful confetti animation that triggers when a habit is successfully completed, providing a sense of accomplishment and positive reinforcement.\n\nTo enhance the user experience further, integrate a calendar view that displays habit completion over time. This feature enables users to visualize their progress and identify patterns in their habit-forming journey. By breaking down the app development process into manageable steps and using AI-generated code, you can create a user-friendly and visually appealing app that encourages consistent habit tracking.\n\nInput Field and Plus Sign: Create a simple and intuitive interface for users to add new habits they want to track.\n\nCreate a simple and intuitive interface for users to add new habits they want to track.

Calendar View: Integrate a calendar view that displays habit completion over time, allowing users to track their progress and identify patterns.\n\nTesting and Iterating: Ensuring a Seamless User Experience\n\nTesting is a crucial step in the app development process, and Xcode provides a powerful tool called the iOS simulator to help you ensure your app\u2019s functionality. The simulator allows you to test your app on various virtual devices, simulating different screen sizes, resolutions, and hardware configurations. This enables you to identify and address any potential issues or bugs before releasing your app to the public.\n\nBased on the insights gained from testing, you can iterate on your app\u2019s features by adding new prompts in Cursor AI. This iterative approach ensures that your app meets user needs, functions smoothly, and provides an optimal user experience. By continuously refining and improving your app, you can create a polished and professional-grade application that stands out in the competitive iOS app market.\n\nExploring Potential and Future Steps\n\nThe ease and accessibility of app development using AI tools like Cursor AI highlight the immense potential for anyone, regardless of their technical background, to create powerful and engaging mobile applications. Once you have completed your habit-tracking app, consider taking the next step by uploading it to the App Store. This process involves following Apple\u2019s submission guidelines, ensuring your app meets their quality standards, and potentially monetizing your app through in-app purchases or advertisements.\n\nBy using the power of AI in app development, you can focus on creativity, innovation, and delivering a seamless user experience, making app development an achievable goal for beginners and experts alike. As you continue to explore the possibilities of AI-assisted app development, you may discover new opportunities to create more complex and feature-rich applications, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the world of mobile app development.\n\nApp Store Submission: Follow Apple\u2019s guidelines and submit your app to the App Store, making it available to a wide audience of iOS users.\n\nFollow Apple\u2019s guidelines and submit your app to the App Store, making it available to a wide audience of iOS users.

These samples contained 614 viruses, many of which are likely new to science.\n\nAlthough the idea of viruses on your toothbrush may trigger heebie-jeebies, this discovery isn't a cause for concern, the team said. The viruses are bacteriophages, or \"phages,\" which infect bacterial cells, rather than humans.\n\nWhat's more, these newfound viruses could be useful for developing treatments against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Scientists are working to develop \"phage therapies\" that use viruses to supplement or replace traditional antibiotics, beating back the defenses of dangerous bacteria.\n\nRelated: Scientists in China find mysterious virus at the bottom of the Mariana Trench\n\nThese new findings, published Oct. 9 in the journal Frontiers in Microbiomes , could provide more potential options for future phage therapies.\n\n\"The number of viruses that we found is absolutely wild,\" study lead author Erica Hartmann, a professor of microbiology at Northwestern University, said in a statement .\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

And you don't even have to go far to find it; it's right under our noses.\"\n\nScientists previously estimated that there are likely about 1 trillion species of microbes on our planet, 99.9% of which remain undiscovered. This blew away previous estimates suggesting that the number of microbial species was in the millions, roughly in line with the number of insect species. Among those many microbes are the viruses that infect them, and in turn, alter the activity of their cells.\n\nBacteriophages come in many forms, and some are useful for slaying superbugs. (Image credit: SCIEPRO via Getty Images)\n\nTo investigate the hidden universe of microbial life, scientists have plumbed exotic locations, like the deep ocean , but the researchers behind the new study looked closer to home, swabbing showerheads and toothbrushes from the houses of study volunteers. After examining the DNA in these samples, the scientists found the samples collectively contained more than 600 different viruses, yet each individual sample looked very different from the next.\n\n\"We saw basically no overlap in virus types between showerheads and toothbrushes,\" Hartmann said. \"We also saw very little overlap between any two samples at all. Each showerhead and each toothbrush is like its own little island.\"\n\nViruses known as mycobacteriophages were the most prevalent type found in the samples. These phages infect and kill mycobacteria, a broad group of microbes that includes some disease-causing germs \u2014 for example, those that cause chronic lung infections, leprosy and tuberculosis .\n\n\"We could envision taking these mycobacteriophages and using them as a way to clean pathogens out of your plumbing system,\u201d Hartmann said.\n\nBy studying these newfound viruses further, the researchers also hope to harness them to make new antibacterial drugs. In the meantime, they said that people shouldn't fret about the microscopic beasties found in our bathrooms.\n\n\"Microbes are everywhere, and the vast majority of them will not make us sick,\" Hartmann said."

        "article_content": "At the dawn of the 1900s, science remained a domain largely inaccessible to women. Despite societal constraints, a select group of pioneering women found a path to contribute to science through illustration. Drawing was a decidedly \u201cwomanly\u201d pastime in the early 1900s, so illustration became an acceptable avenue for scientifically inclined women to document and interpret the natural world despite the gender bias in traditional scientific roles.\n\nThese are the stories of four women in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Department of Invertebrate Zoology who broke through the gendered barriers of science and made significant contributions to scientific discovery through art.\n\nViolet Dandridge (1878\u20131956)\n\nViolet Dandridge was one of the earliest women employed as an illustrator by the Smithsonian. In 1903, she embarked on expeditions to document invertebrates alongside renowned female scientists Mary Jane Rathbun and Harriet Richardson. Dandridge surveyed the east coast with Rathbun and Richardson to collect and document over 1,000 invertebrate specimens. She meticulously captured their likeness in colored paintings.\n\nDandridge captured the delicate features of a wide variety of animals in crisp detail. These illustrations provided crucial insight for scientists to determine the unique features of each animal. Beyond her pioneering work in science, Dandridge was also an active participant in the woman's suffrage movement.\n\nAime Motter Awl (1887\u20131973)\n\nAime Awl defied societal norms by pursuing a career in medical illustration and later transitioning to the natural sciences. At Johns Hopkins Medical School, Awl studied alongside medical students, observed surgeries, and took advanced anatomy courses. She kept her work secret from friends who she feared would disapprove of such \u201cimproper\u201d work for a woman. Her talent and dedication earned her international recognition, leading to commissions to illustrate rare surgical procedures.\n\nAwl was hired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1929 and not only supported mollusk and crustacean research but also provided illustrations for almost every department in the museum. Her invertebrate work focused on many of the tiniest of animals\u2014such as copepods and ostracods\u2014and was even published in the Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nIn 1944, she joined the Soroptimist Club in Washington, DC, an organization still active today whose volunteers help women and girls gain access to the education and training needed to achieve economic empowerment.\n\nCarolyn Bartlett Gast (1929\u20132015)\n\nCarolyn Gast worked as a scientific illustrator with the Department of Invertebrate Zoology from 1954 to 1985. She used various techniques to capture the essence of invertebrate life. Her illustration of a microscopic loriciferan (featured at the beginning of the article), a new phylum discovered in 1983 by Reinhardt M\u00f8bjerg Kristensen in the microscopic ecosystem between grains of sand, is perhaps her most famous and often reproduced illustration.\n\nHer innovative approach to illustration, including experiments with creating 3D images through stereography, aimed to modernize the field. While stereography never got off the ground for scientific illustration, she worked on it as a personal project and even created a 3D alphabet series in the style of Middle Age Illumination. This artistic style comes from Medieval manuscripts which were decorated with intricate \u201cminiatures\u201d lining the boarders of pages, ornate lettering, and gold leaf.\n\nAs a founding member of the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators in 1968, Gast played a pivotal role in fostering a community of aspiring illustrators. She was also an avid proponent of using art to increase public science literacy.\n\nMarilyn Schotte (1947\u20132020)\n\nMarilyn Schotte dedicated over three decades to the Department of Invertebrate Zoology as both a researcher and illustrator. In addition to supporting the research of Drs. Brian Kensley and Ellen Strong, she published 40 scientific papers and a book of her own on crustaceans.\n\nA dedicated worker, Schotte once spent 24 hours straight drawing larval squid to meet a deadline. Her contributions to science inspired Kensley to name a species of isopod after Schotte (Malacanthura schotteae). Known for her meticulous attention to detail, Schotte's illustrations were praised for their accuracy and depth. She also supported other scientific illustrators by serving as the president of the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators from 1984 to 1988. Her work was featured as part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian Ripley Center in 1996.\n\nIn an era when women faced significant barriers in scientific pursuits, these remarkable individuals contributed to research at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History through meticulously documenting every scale, antenna, spine, and intricate feature of a dizzying array of earth\u2019s animals to help describe life on Earth. Their legacy endures as a testament to the transformative power of art in advancing scientific knowledge and challenging societal norms."

        "date": "InfoQ18h",
        "source": "InfoQ",
        "article_content": "Jesse Anderson, managing director of the Big Data Institute and author of Data Teams, recently published the latest findings from his annual Data Teams Survey of 81 data leaders and engineers across a range of enterprise types. The 2024 survey shows a slow adoption of LLMs by data teams, a neutral impact from remote work, and an overall decline in the perception of delivered value. The survey also calls out that data-operations capabilities are missing from half of the respondents.\n\nThe Data Teams Survey\u2019s analysis emphasised the importance of spreading skills and cognitive load in the data domain across teams with data science, engineering, and operations capabilities. Anderson wrote that while data science and engineering teams are well-represented, \"operations teams are lacking in half of the respondents.\" Further, he also highlighted inconsistencies in how data teams tend to define the role of operations engineers, with only 20% aligning on a definition which covers systems engineering skills. He wrote:\n\nThe individual contributors must meet the criteria and definitions to represent the job title. We see well-represented responses for data scientists and data engineers with operations lagging.\n\nAnderson also published another article looking at the evolution of results from Data Teams Surveys between 2020 and 2024, in which he commented on the methodologies and practices used by data teams. Anderson wrote that over time he\u2019s seen a \"decline in DataOps and an increase in teams not using a methodology\" of any kind. Anderson wrote that \"choosing a methodology is still essential\" for successful teams.\n\nCommenting on differentiators between high and low-value teams, Anderson wrote that high performers followed \"more best practices.\" The survey showed that these practices include engineering norms such as unit testing, close business collaboration, picking the right technologies, and having appropriate cross-functional skills.\n\nA recent episode of the Data Engineering Podcast discussed the need for increased engineering and operational rigour in data teams with Petr Janda, founder of Synq.io. He started Synq, a data operations reliability and observability platform, following his experience with data teams that measured incident recovery times in weeks, compared to hours for other engineering teams. Janda talked about the need for incident resolution processes which factor in a granular, data specific, impact on stakeholders and downstream systems. Calling out missing processes, he said:\n\nEveryone was focusing on the problem of detecting issues \u2026 So once we detect that a certain table is missing data or that a certain test is now failing because some business validation is not met, what happens afterwards? What is the workflow from the perspective of finding the right team to deal with that issue, and assessing the impact on the company? Is this even an issue we have to deal with right now, or is that something that can wait and be dealt with later?\n\nAnderson also reviewed participants' responses to questions about their teams' delivery of value to the business. Looking back over previous surveys, he observed a downward trend that he said, \"should give everyone in the industry pause.\" Anderson noted that many respondents \"highlighted a disconnect between data teams and business needs.\" This was attributed to insufficient \"domain knowledge\" and issues with \"communicating data value to stakeholders.\" Anderson wrote:\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing this lower value creation trend anecdotally, and now we see it in the data. For a nascent industry like data teams, we should gradually increase the amount of value created or, at a minimum, stay the same. This downward trend has been troubling me for some time \u2026 It is concerning to me that there wasn\u2019t an increase in value creation over three years.\"\n\nOn the subject of remote work, the survey shows that the majority of respondents indicate that remote work has not impacted their team\u2019s productivity. The survey also showed a slow and shallow adoption of LLMs, with only 12% of surveyed teams using LLMs for data processing, which he described as their \"ideal\" use case. After accounting for 24% of teams not using LLMs at all, Anderson explained that the remainder primarily use them \"for code generation, ideation or copy creation, and code debugging.\"\n\nJanda concluded by reflecting on his hope that data teams would become more embedded into organisations\u2019 operational radar, rather than \"seeing data as this thing on the side.\" He also called out the need for more cross-functional skills on data teams, saying:\n\nI hope to see a lot more teams being cross-functional in the way I remember we removed boundaries between frontend and backend and infra teams, by creating cross-functional units."
