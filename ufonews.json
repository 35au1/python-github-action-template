The rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa\n\nHe has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansj\u00fcrgen K\u00f6hler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (CENAP), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says K\u00f6hler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office CENAP.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nAccording to its director, CENAP has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, K\u00f6hler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact for observers of the inexplicable\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, K\u00f6hler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe founded CENAP as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand.\"\n\nThe organization, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to CENAP has changed dramatically over the decades, K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese Lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nNumber of reports spike thanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organization recorded over 850 cases by October 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups - rocket ignitions - in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun,\" K\u00f6hler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, CENAP records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nThe organization also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the CENAP director.\n\nDo only conspiracy theorists report UFO sightings?\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, K\u00f6hler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship ... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nK\u00f6hler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organization is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nK\u00f6hler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life - or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth.\"\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\"\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa"

Wearing old-era clothes and carrying an antique camera, he left police officials shocked\n\nWe have constructed vehicles capable of traversing vast distances in mere hours, yet the journey through time remains beyond our reach. (Representative/Shutterstock)\n\nFrom the moment humankind emerged, progress has been its hallmark. We have constructed vehicles capable of traversing vast distances in mere hours, yet one journey remains beyond our reach: the journey through time. This very limitation fuels our persistent fascination with the concept of time travel.\n\nStories of temporal displacement abound, but concrete evidence remains elusive. In one such instance of time travel, a person made such a claim that it left even seasoned police baffled.\n\nrelated stories\n\nAccording to a report from The Mirror, a man named Sergey Ponomarenko made a shocking claim in 2006. This man, found in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, told officials that he had travelled to the year 2006 from 1932. His clothes were of that era, and he also had an old camera. The documents he showed were also from 1950. He was 25 years old at the time. Furthermore, his girlfriend was in the photo; when officials found her, she was 70 years old.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nHe also displayed a photograph of a UFO, claiming he had travelled to the future after taking it. Officials were sceptical, and upon questioning his former girlfriend, learned that he had vanished without a trace. He then presented a photograph of himself in 2050, appearing elderly. While baffled officials were consulting with doctors about the situation, he abruptly disappeared.\n\nThe story caused widespread confusion in 2006 when images, purportedly of a UFO, surfaced. A YouTuber later claimed that the pictures originated from \u201cAliens,\" a Ukrainian television show from the 1970s, and were digitally altered. However, the claims regarding the man\u2019s girlfriend and doctor remain unresolved, deepening the mystery.\n\nLocation : Kyiv, Ukraine\n\nFirst Published: December 23, 2024, 19:20 IST"

            "article_content": "LLMs. Co-pilots. Agents. Two years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, the hype behind artificial Intelligence remains palpable. Major tech companies are pouring billions into sparkling new infrastructure for AI workloads. Utility companies in areas with dense data centers are seeing revenues and power consumption soar. Yet, outside of semiconductor and infrastructure players, few companies have seen significant revenue from AI products. Investors are increasingly left asking: When will these massive capital investments start benefiting software companies? What\u2019s causing the delay?\n\nWhere AI is showing up in our world today\n\nFirst, let\u2019s be clear: AI has been around in many industries for years, including financial services. Quantitative traders long ago embraced techniques that are now classified as \"AI\" including non-linear regressions and advanced optimization techniques. What excites us now are the rapid advancements in new areas like Generative AI, pattern recognition and deep learning. You\u2019ve likely noticed early use cases of GenAI like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot or Adobe\u2019s AI Assistant. These tools are being integrated into software platforms across industries with new use cases emerging at a rapid clip.\n\n\n\nAcross other industries, anecdotal datapoints of GenAI value creation are starting to stack up. Walmart recently shared that large language models helped them to \u201ccreate or improve more than 850 million pieces of data across its product catalog,\u201d completing the project with just 1% of the typical headcount. Amazon\u2019s CEO Andy Jassy shared a similar datapoint when he disclosed that the use of Amazon\u2019s GenAI assistant saved 7,500 \u201cdeveloper-years\u201d of programming time in a recent major software update.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most salient example of AI generating value is hiding under our collective noses in social media, where algorithmic matching on posts like Instagram and TikTok optimizes the content and ads we see. This area has seen tremendous gains in recent years and has helped leading AI adopters in social media improve ad returns and gain market share.\n\n\n\nAt our firm, we\u2019ve adopted AI with care, led initially by eager adoption of various AI copilots and coding assistants. We have also explored alpha-generating use cases like pattern recognition and sentiment analysis. Looking further out, we are excited about developing custom assistants to superpower our investment and client teams. We believe this is just the tip of the iceberg. Much more is yet to come.\n\nThe delay in benefits of AI for software investors\n\n\n\nSo, if AI is being leveraged across industries, why hasn\u2019t the software sector seen the uptick in growth that investors expected? New revenue streams for software firms haven\u2019t met the hype, leading to stark underperformance for the software industry with a few notable exceptions. We believe this partly reflects Amara\u2019s law: We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. The rapid adoption of ChatGPT, and the sense of magic many of us experienced when first using it, may have exacerbated elevated expectations.\n\n\n\nThe reality is that product development and adoption take time. AI development and testing alone can take months, if not years, before a project is ready for deployment. This timeline is further elongated by data governance challenges. As anyone who has worked at a massive conglomerate can likely attest, many large firms have poorly structured and poorly governed data policies, rife with operational silos and inconsistent rules. This complicates development. Compliance and cybersecurity can further stretch timelines. While many firms are seeing real and tangible benefits from AI, getting these projects into production is taking longer than anticipated, creating a mismatch between investor expectations and reality.\n\n\n\nWhile this delay has certainly led to disappointment among software investors, it has not been the only issue. The rapid pace of breakthrough innovation in AI has also sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the room for other technology projects. Some companies have paused major technology initiatives, hesitating to commit to multi\\year contracts while still developing their AI strategy. All of this has elongated sales cycles and created a temporary slowdown in software demand.\n\nA window of opportunity for longer-term investors\n\nSurveys have shown that corporations are seeing real, tangible value creation from AI, especially in cost reduction. But AI isn\u2019t just about optimizing existing business models \u2014 it\u2019s driving innovation in areas like autonomous cars, healthcare, clean energy, and even entertainment and media. These advancements have the potential to reshape industries and open up new markets. For long-term investors, this makes AI more than a short-term play \u2014 it\u2019s a foundation for future growth. Again, like many transformative technologies, AI\u2019s impact may have been overestimated in the short term, but its long-term potential will likely have been underestimated.\n\n\n\nWe believe the current market anxiety in software creates an opportunity for long-term investors. The project delays are largely temporary in nature and should be resolved as firms update their technological road map and set AI priorities. Recently, we\u2019ve noticed renewed enthusiasm in the software demand environment. As demand normalizes, we expect industry growth to re-accelerate, which should remove the wet blanket from valuations.\n\nBottom line\n\n\n\nA Gartner survey earlier this year found that 90% of CFOs expected increased AI budgets in 2024, with none planning cuts. Yet, it has been clear that many projects have faced delays due to complexity, data governance issues, security concerns, and a scarcity of talent. This has created an air pocket in an industry that is usually known more for \"eating the world\" than for booms and busts. Just as the internet didn\u2019t take off overnight, AI still has some development before it starts to deliver significant results for investors. We believe those returns are coming, and the impact is on the horizon if investors can remain patient. Now is the time for investors to position themselves for the shift from hype to impact. As AI projects move from development to deployment, those who stay the course or increase their exposure to the right opportunities are likely to see meaningful returns ahead.\n\nDave Smith is head of technology investing at Bailard.

Each was followed by much applause and favorable stock price movement. But when I got those phones into my hands, the AI was underwhelming, to say the least.\n\nThe theory is that smartphones as we know them are evolving into something new: AI smartphones. An AI smartphone will be a new kind of device that doesn\u2019t force you to interact with a grid of apps all day long; you\u2019ll be able to ask it to order pizza or send an email just by using an AI-imbued voice assistant. You\u2019ll be able to point your camera at a flyer for a show, have the AI check whether you\u2019re free, and add it to your calendar. You\u2019ll ask it about something a friend said to you \u2014 maybe in an email or a text, you\u2019re not sure which \u2014 and it will go find the information for you.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini assistant has steadily improved since launch but still falls short of a true AI assistant.\n\nPersonally, all of the above sounds great to me. I\u2019d love some help with the chores I carry out a hundred times a day on my phone \u2014 and with the firehose of incoming information and notifications I deal with. But AI smartphones are not here yet, not by a long shot, despite what you may have heard. Instead, what we have feels like a collection of loosely associated tech demos.\n\nThe (supposedly) AI smartphones of 2024\n\nAll of the major phone makers are at fault. Samsung opened the year with its Galaxy S24 launch in January, declaring \u201cGalaxy AI is here\u201d at a hockey arena-appropriate volume. To be sure, the devices it announced are good smartphones, and they run a blend of Samsung and Google\u2019s Gemini Nano models on-device, but I wouldn\u2019t call them AI smartphones.\n\nSupposedly, they can help you take distractions out of your photos \u2014 but you might end up with something even more distracting instead. The live language interpreter feature for phone calls could come in handy for something like making a dinner reservation. But it also translated a statement from my colleague as \u201cI am eating my chair.\u201d (She was not.) Most users will find that these AI features fade into the background once the novelty wears off.\n\nSometimes AI gets it right \u2014 it correctly identifies an artificial plant here.\n\nLater in 2024, fall hardware season arrived early with AI-ified Pixels. Google has made much of AI on its phones for the past couple of years, but the company\u2019s Gemini AI is absolutely everywhere on the Pixel 9 series. There\u2019s an AI-generated summary at the top of the weather app, a new app that saves and tags your screenshots using AI, a new AI-powered default assistant, and lots of AI image generation tools \u2014 from silly to seriously worrying.\n\nSome of it does feel useful, particularly the screenshots app, which is the kind of thing you might find handy if you tend to keep infinite Chrome tabs open on your phone as bookmarks. But these features, siloed into their respective apps, don\u2019t feel like they have much to do with each other. Gemini sort of connects the dots with extensions, but support for different apps is being added slowly \u2014 and even with an extension, Gemini can only do so much for you.\n\nApple Intelligence started shipping a month after the iPhone 16, but its blockbuster features won\u2019t arrive until 2025.\n\nLast but not least, we met the iPhones \u201cbuilt for Apple Intelligence\u201d in September. I think it says a lot about the state of Apple\u2019s AI that the iPhone 16 initially shipped without Apple Intelligence. AI features finally arrived in late October with iOS 18.1. And if anyone was waiting with bated breath, this first update was probably underwhelming.\n\nRight now, Apple Intelligence includes summaries for notifications and emails, tools to alter the style of your writing, and a new glowing UI for Siri. Notification summaries can be useful, but usually they\u2019re just funny. The writing tools are standard fare at this point, and Siri is basically the same old assistant with a new coat of paint. There\u2019s more to come, but what\u2019s here now certainly doesn\u2019t add up to an AI smartphone.\n\nA messy year for AI\n\nIt\u2019s not just phones; this is a messy moment for AI in general. Depending on who you ask, AI is either a massive bubble that\u2019s about to burst or a few months away from evolving into digital God. AI is being foisted on us in every direction: surfacing in Google search results, lurking in every Meta product, greeting you by name in the Spotify app. It\u2019s hard to separate the signal from the noise when it comes to AI, because the noise is everywhere and it\u2019s so goddamn loud!\n\nAnd there really might be a signal in there \u2014 especially when it comes to our phones. Siri really might become more useful, with an Apple Intelligence update this spring that will allow it to take action in apps through something known as App Intents. Developers will be able to surface certain actions \u2014 like ordering the pizza that AI proponents keep promising \u2014 so they\u2019re accessible at the system level by Siri. Google seems to be preparing a similar framework in Android 16, which could help bridge the gap between Gemini and individual apps without the apps needing an entire extension. And who knows? Maybe Bixby will get in the game, too.\n\nThe trouble is, after a full year of supposedly game-changing AI on our mobile devices that amounted to nothing, it\u2019s starting to sound like the phone makers are crying wolf. The real AI smartphones need to stand up pretty soon \u2014 before our collective patience starts to run out."

However, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Garrett Simons a new property they were moved to has caused her to be fearful for her children due to \"paranormal activity\".\n\nThe mum told proceedings how since they moved in \u201cnumerous objects\u201d in the new house have been \u201cflown from side to side\u201d, while doors and a table and chairs \u201cwere moving in front of our eyes\u201d. She claims while making food for her children, objects flew out of the cupboard she opened.\n\nMs Stokes said she contacted the previous occupant of the house, who wrote them a letter the applicant described as \u201cbeyond traumatic\u201d. She claimed she brought the letter to the attention of the council but was \u201claughed at\u201d in a meeting. She said: \u201cEveryone deserves a home. I never asked for a mansion, I asked for a safe home for my kids.\n\n\u201cI just want somewhere safe for my kids five days before Christmas,\u201d the Irish Mirror reported.\n\nThe High Court heard how the mould in the first property was so bad the entire family had to sleep downstairs instead of their bedrooms. They also had to make several hospital visits. The couple claim in the five years they lived in the property, the problem with mould became so bad that they were forced to leave and live temporarily with relatives before returning to the house.\n\nThe court heard the council placed the family on a transfer list and the offer of a new property was accepted by the Stokes in October. At the High Court Mr Justice Simons struck out the Stokes\u2019 claim against Leitrim County Council.\n\nMr Justice Simons said the claim before him only related to the first property and that if there were new claims, they would have to be lodged separately with the court. Mr Justice Simons said the only case before him was in relation to the first house and \u201cthe case has come and gone, as it were\u201d due to the Stokes' transferring to the new house.\n\nHe told Ms Stokes he understood her concern about the second house experiencing \"paranormal activity\" and her fears for the safety of her children but a third house would mean a new application to the local authority."

            "article_content": "The past, especially when it is traumatic, does not always fade away even after years and years have already passed. Across the United States of America, various houses hold memories of tragedy, pain, and mystery. From abandoned mansions to eerie estates, this article brings you a detailed list of the top 10 haunted houses in America with notorious histories that may leave one with chills down their spines.\n\nMost Haunted House in America\n\n1. Winchester Mystery House\n\nLocation: 525 South Winchester Boulevard San Jose, CA 95128.\n\nThe Winchester Mystery House was built by Sarah Winchester, the widow of the son and founder of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, William Winchester, in 1884. The house which was supposed to be a simple eight-room farmhouse turned into a four-story home with 160 rooms, around 10,000 windows, and 2,000 doors. What\u2019s weird about this house is that there are staircases that lead to nowhere, doors that do not have anything on the other side, and rooms that have no exit. According to the legends, Sarah built her house like a maze to confuse the spirits of the victims who died because the rifles manufactured by her husband\u2019s company she believed would come seeking vengeance from her. The house is believed to be haunted by those spirits.\n\n2. Myrtles Plantation\n\nLocation: 7747 U.S. 61, St. Francisville, Louisiana.\n\nAnother one on the list of 10 haunted houses in America with notorious histories is the Myrtles Plantation located in Louisiana. The owner of the house, Judge Clark Woodruff, reportedly had an affair with a servant of the plantation, Chloe. However, when the owner started seeing another girl, Chloe feared she would be thrown into the fields to work with other servants. Hence, she came up with a plan and baked a cake that had poisonous crushed oleander leaves. She hoped to restore her worth by nursing the children of the owner who ate the cake back to health but the children died. Afraid of being accused of the murder, the other servants hung her to death and threw her body into the river. People have heard the laughing sounds of young girls and spotted spirits since then.\n\n3. Whaley House\n\nLocation: 2476 San Diego Avenue, San Diego, California.\n\nWhaley house was the residence of the Whaley family. According to the legends associated with the house, it is said to be haunted even before the construction of it began. The house is reportedly built on the land where the Yankee Jim Robinson, a popular local thief, was publicly executed. The family, soon after shifting into the house, was struck by doom and saw many deaths of close family members, including the daughters. The family believed that the house was haunted by the spirit of Yankee Jim Robinson, and ghost sightings are still reported making it another one of the top 10 haunted houses in America with notorious histories. The haunted house is so famous that people have started going on guided tours of the house.\n\n4. LaLaurie Mansion\n\nLocation: 1140 Royal St, New Orleans, LA 70116, USA.\n\nThe LaLaurie Mansion, located in New Orleans, was once the residence of a socialite serial killer named Marie Delphine Macarty, who is believed to have tortured and killed the servants in her mansion brutally. Even after 200 years, people still believe to have seen ghostly appearances and experienced paranormal activities in the mansion making it another one of the top 10 haunted houses in America with notorious histories. The mansion has also been a major part of the famous American television series American Horror Story but the crew never filmed in the actual mansion.\n\n5. Lizzie Borden House\n\nLocation: 230 Second St, Fall River, MA 02721, USA.\n\nLizzie Borden House is another one of the top 10 haunted houses in America with notorious histories that is now a popular tourist attraction for those who wish to explore dark history. The house is famous for the unsolved double murders of Andrew and Abby Borden that took place in the house for which Lizzie Borden, who was the only one present in the house at the time of the murder, was acquitted. However, many different theories circulate about who actually committed those murders. People who visited the house reported many strange things and paranormal activities in the house.\n\n6. Villisca Axe Murder House\n\nLocation: 508 E 2nd St, Villisca, IA 50864, United States.\n\nThe Villisca Axe Murder House is another one of the top 10 haunted houses in America with notorious histories that are famous for the multiple murders that were committed in the year 1912 when 8 victims, including 6 children, were murdered in their sleep, followed by a church service. The murder mystery remained unsolved, and the people visiting the house reported hearing whispers and knocks and having unexplainable paranormal experiences.\n\n7. 112 Ocean Avenue\n\nLocation: 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville, New York, USA.\n\nAnother one in the list of top 10 haunted houses in America with notorious histories is 112 Ocean Avenue, which came into the limelight after becoming the crime location for the mass murders committed in the year 1974 when a 23-year-old man named Ronald DeFeo Jr. shot six members of his family dead in their sleep.

            "article_content": "In early October, Metal Gear Solid creator and friend of every celebrity alive Hideo Kojima posted that he'd watched and enjoyed the debut of Dan Da Dan, the anime adaptation of Yukinobu Tatsu's terrific manga. This isn't out of the ordinary, as Kojima is pretty fond of liberally posting about all of the media that he likes. And when he praised the seventh episode, at the time the best episode so far in a long string of 'best episodes so far', it affirmed that Dan Da Dan is a series that you shouldn't miss.\n\nHowever, the power of Dan Da Dan lies in something that might not be apparent at first. In fact, much of the strength of the series comes from it undermining any expectations that you might have.\n\nDan Da Dan tells the story of two teens, the sheepish Ken Takakura, aka \"Okarun\", who is fascinated by aliens and the paranormal, and the outspoken Momo Ayase who, thanks in part to her spirit medium grandmother, is invested in the supernatural.\n\nNeither is convinced about the other's obsessions, and so when Takakura goes to investigate a \"haunted\" tunnel, he becomes possessed by a spirit there. Meanwhile, Ayase is abducted by perverse aliens, an encounter that awakens her psychokinetic powers. Working together, the two begin to take on all manner of fantastical enemies, all while navigating their own burgeoning romantic feelings.\n\nUnusual usual\n\n(Image credit: \u00a9Yukinobu Tatsu/SHUEISHA, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\n'People taking on sci-fi monsters while blushing around one another' is certainly not uncharted territory, and it would be easy for Dan Da Dan to operate on a level of simple escapism. But few anime have been able to filter all this through pure, effective teenage angst quite like Dan Da Dan. Ayase, like most teens, fears being an outsider, and still reckons with childhood memories of being treated like one thanks to her grandmother's metaphysical mandates.\n\nTakakura, on the other hand, soon discovers that his genitals have been stolen by Turbo Granny, the spirit that lurks within him (yes, really). And so the typical hyper-awareness that one has about themselves during this stage in your life is magnified tenfold for the eternally anxious Takakura. It doesn't help that many of the creatures and spirits prod and taunt Takakura and Ayase about these things, exposing all of the little insecurities that even regular teenagers struggle to hide.\n\nDan Da Dan is also beautifully animated and bears stellar character and creature designs (courtesy of anime veteran Naoyuki Onda), some of which reflect traditional Japanese yokai and a host of otherworldly beasts. These foes are outsized, monstrous, and come loaded with their own eccentricities, but just when you feel caught up in the adrenaline of seeing a spirit-filled Takakura take on one of them in a high-speed contest, you're hit with the gut punch of what lies under the quirks.\n\nSign up for the Total Film Newsletter Bringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nMany of these foes, from Turbo Granny, whose spirit tends to the souls of young women who died under horrific circumstances, to Acrobatic Silky, a yokai who desperately searches for the child that was once taken from her when she was alive, generate profound sympathy. The latter was even treated to a beautiful tearjerker of an extended flashback that showed her attempts to give her daughter the best life possible despite their circumstances.\n\nBittersweet victory\n\n(Image credit: Netflix)\n\nAs such, their defeat is rarely a triumphant 'boss fight' event, but instead a bittersweet denouement to a tragic afterlife. Even human characters that initially emerge as one-note bullies, like pink-haired Aira Shiratori, are revealed to be grappling with something personal. Aira, for instance, lost her mother at a young age, and much of her imperious personality comes from her search for a purpose.\n\nDan Da Dan continuously shows us that it has heart. Takakura and Ayase bicker constantly in will-they/won't-they fashion, and it's common in lesser anime for relationships to subsist entirely on this type of repartee. But the pair are also constantly worried about one another. From the beginning, there's genuine care shown for each other's emotional upkeep, something that they've taken upon themselves even if the other person is still, in the grand scheme of things, a stranger. They're not teaming up to save the world (though they do want to get Takakura's privates returned to him) \u2013 they're teaming up because they've formed a genuine connection. In their cliquish school setting, that's pretty rare.\n\nIt's easy to imagine the kind of story that Dan Da Dan could've been, one that milks nothing but fan service out of Takakura and Ayase's relationship, one that presents new creatures for the sole purpose of their explosive defeats, and one that ignores any weighty themes about growing up and teenage paranoia in favor of purely digestible escapades. But Dan Da Dan rarely takes the easy route. Instead, it's consistently thoughtful in a way that has turned each episode into not just a fun weekly occurrence, but an outright event. Combine that with a production that is hitting all the right notes, and you have an anime that's bound to surprise you regardless of whether you've read the manga or not.\n\nDan Da Dan is set to return for season 2 in July 2025. While we wait, you can read everything we know about Dan Da Dan season 2."

            "article_content": "In a recent chat with YouTube channel RichardMetalFan (posted on Dec. 13), Shadows Fall drummer Jason Bittner revealed why he \u201chated\u201d both Metallica and Slayer when he first heard them (and what led to him changing his mind).\n\nBittner\u2019s Discovery of Heavy Metal\n\nAt the start of their conversation, Bittner is asked, \u201cGrowing up, what were the first band that got you into metal and made you want to start playing drums?\u201d\n\nBittner responds:\n\nThe band that got me into \u201cheavy metal,\u201d technically, is Iron Maiden. Maiden\u2019s my favorite metal band of all time as well. That was the first band I saw of that genre in 1980, the day that MTV came on the air. I was 10 years old, and I was, like, \u201cWhat in God's name is this?\u201d And that just sent me on my trajectory [with] Maiden and Judas Priest.\n\nAside from Bittner\u2019s minor timeline mistake (MTV debuted in 1981), his love for Iron Maiden and Judas Priest isn\u2019t surprising. What is more shocking, however, is that he follows by confessing that he was far less impressed by Metallica and Slayer when he first heard them.\n\n\u201cI wanna say, I think [in] \u201984, a friend of mine let me borrow a record [Ride the Lightning],\u201d Bittner reflects. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you gotta check out this band.' And I'm, like, 'Who's Metal-licka?' And he goes, 'No, it's pronounced Metallica, man!' I'm, like, 'All right, cool. Metallica.\u2019 And I took it home and I hated it.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Shadows Fall Vs. Haunted Prison\n\nWhy Bittner Originally Didn\u2019t Like Metallica or Slayer\n\nInterestingly, it\u2019s related to his love for Bruce Dickinson and Rob Halford. Bittner explains:\n\nI was like, \u201cGod, what the hell is this?\u201d 'Cause I was used to Bruce Dickinson and Halford, and all of a sudden, you have James Hetfield, and I'm, like, \u201cWhat on earth is this?\u201d Maybe, like, a week later, I taped the album just in case I might like it one day, and I gave the record back to my friend. And, like, a week later, I'm doing my paper route and I was humming [a guitar riff]. And I'm, like, \u201cWhat is this that I'm singing to myself?\u201d And it was the riff from \u201cFight Fire With Fire.\u201d And I'm, like, \u201cOh, that's that Metallica band. I didn't think I liked that.\u201d\n\nHe continues:\n\nA lot of the heavier bands \u2013 even bands I've been in \u2013 when I've heard [them] the first time, I didn't care for [them]. Like Slayer. I hated Slayer at first. I'm, like, \u201cNo way I'm gonna like this.\u201d [Now] Slayer\u2019s my favorite thrash band of all time. Anthrax and Megadeth were the only two that, when I first listened, I wasn't, like, \u201cAargh!\u201d Like, with Anthrax, I was just, like, \u201cHoly shit!\u201d That was, like, the \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 the \u201cbe all, end all\u201d for me right there, because [drummer] Charlie [Benante] was . . . one step beyond [Slayer drummer Dave] Lombardo for me at that point, because, like, Lombardo was feet, but Charlie was the whole fucking package.\n\nWhat Made Him Change His Mind on Metallica and Slayer\n\nBittner add that he was introduced to Metallica first (followed by Megadeth) because a classmate mentioned that \u201cthere\u2019s this dude [Dave Mustaine] that was in Metallica before Kirk Hammett.\u201d\n\nHe explains:\n\nI didn't know about anything pre-'Kill \u2018Em All' . . . [and] he was, like, \u201cNah, this dude [Mustaine] was in the band before [Hammett], and he's got this other band and it's called Megadeth. . . And the first thing I heard was 'Killing Is My Business,' but that was so raw at the time. I was, like, \u201cAll right . . . it's kind of cool. It's fast and stuff.\u201d But, once 'Peace Sells' came out, I was, like, \u201cOh, all right. Now I get it.\u201d . . . Maybe a year after that or within that year, I got into Slayer. A friend of mine had Show No Mercy and he had let me hear that. And I wasn't really that impressed, but then Reign in Blood came out . . . and I bought that . . . went on a spring break vacation my sophomore year of high school to Florida with my mom, and all I did was just I had Reign In Blood . . . I listened to that record just incessantly for a week straight.\n\nFrom there, Bittner came to appreciate \u201chow hard thrash metal drumming was\u201d as he tried to play certain parts himself. \u201cSo, it was Slayer, then Anthrax, and it was basically through the \u201cBig 4\u201d and then everything else under the sun,\u201d he remarks.\n\nInterestingly, he admits that he\u2019s \u201calways been . . . a thrash metal drummer,\u201d adding:\n\nI\u2019m not an extreme metal drummer. I like that stuff, but . . . it's out of my wheelhouse. It's not what I do. But I like a lot of those drummers and went through that whole phase in the mid-'90s. [I was] immersed into Death and Morbid Angel and that stuff. Listening to Pete Sandoval and Sean Reinert and Gene Hoglan. So, my influences go across the board, really. And let's not forget Van Halen, either.\n\nThat\u2019s quite the musical journey, right?\n\nOf course, Shadows Fall recently released a new single and music video, \u201cIn the Grey,\u201d which marks their first piece of new music in over a decade. It also signifies their new partnership with MNRK Music Group.\n\nAs for Metallica, they were ranked no. 9 in Pollstar\u2019s recent tally of the Top 10 Worldwide Top Touring Artists of 2024. Likewise, they remain one of the top ten most popular choices for tattoos, and Kyuss\u2019 Brant Bjork acknowledged that he didn\u2019t like having the band labeled as \u201cthe next Metallica.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Slayer\u2019s Kerry King cited Sabotage as his favorite Black Sabbath LP.\n\nAlso, you can watch the full interview with Bittner below:\n\nShadows Fall\u2019s Jason Bittner Discusses His Musical History With RichardMetalFan"

            "article_content": "In everyday life, when things turn out the opposite of what you expect, it's usually cause for frustration. In science, it's often the starting point for discovery.\n\nThat's what happened to a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and their collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Their unexpected findings in the lab point to an opportunity to improve therapies that use small RNAs to silence disease-causing genes, potentially including those involved in cancer.\n\nSometimes you do an experiment. You think you're testing one idea, but when it doesn't turn out the way you planned, it can lead you to find something else that's much more interesting.\" Eric Lai, PhD, developmental biologist\n\nIn this case, the researchers -; led by Seungjae Lee, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Lai Lab at MSK's Sloan Kettering Institute -; were testing how a protein called ALAS1 helps to make small regulatory RNAs called microRNAs. When they removed the protein from cells, they expected to see levels of microRNAs drop.\n\n\"But instead, we were surprised to see them increase,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nThat counterintuitive result led to the discovery of an unrecognized role for ALAS1 beyond its well-known role in the production of heme. (Heme is an important player in many biological processes, including in oxygen transport -; giving hemoglobin its name -; in energy production, and in making microRNAs.)\n\nThe team's findings were published in Science, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals.\n\nHow little RNA snippets silence genes\n\nBoth microRNAs and the related class of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small snippets of RNA -; just 21 or 22 nucleotides long -; that bind to specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and repress them.\n\nThere's a bucket brigade of players that together convert longer RNA molecules into the tiny active products, and a key takeaway is that scientists have harnessed this knowledge to turn small RNAs into drugs that can silence genes that cause specific diseases.\n\nThe first siRNA drug, patisiran, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 to treat a debilitating genetic disorder called hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. A handful of additional siRNA drugs have been approved since, with more moving their way through clinical trials. Doctors see great potential to develop siRNA medicines against both rare diseases and more common ones (siRNA drugs are sometimes called RNAi drugs, meaning they work by interfering with messenger RNA accumulation).\n\nA moonlighting enzyme\n\nBack in the Lai Lab, Dr. Lee had discovered that upon removing ALAS1 from cells, they made more microRNAs. And further experiments showed that removing any of the other enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway did not affect microRNA levels.\n\n\"This told us that ALAS1 has another job outside of helping to make heme, which no one had realized,\" Dr. Lee says.\n\n\"We can consider this a 'moonlighting' function,\" Dr. Lai adds. \"And here we discovered that ALAS1 has this secret role regulating microRNAs that's not connected to its normal role in heme synthesis.\"\n\nPotential to make siRNA drugs work better\n\nThe discovery led the MSK researchers to partner with colleagues from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who specialize in heme regulation and ALAS genes -; Makiko Yasuda, MD, PhD, Robert Desnick MD, PhD, and postdoctoral fellow Sangmi Lee, PhD. This allowed the MSK researchers to extend their findings from cell culture into custom animal models that the Mount Sinai group were developing.\n\nAnd in mice, again, removing ALAS (specifically in liver cells) led to a global increase in microRNAs.\n\n\"The emerging picture is that ALAS acts as a brake on the production of microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"So we thought, now that we know how to remove this brake, maybe we can use that to improve the efficacy of siRNA drugs and their ability to silence their target genes.\"\n\nIn theory, this knowledge might help boost the activity of siRNA drugs against any problematic gene that is overactive in disease, Dr. Lai explains. Potentially this could include oncogenes known to drive cancer.\n\n\"But we're not quite there yet,\" he says. \"Therapeutic siRNA drugs don't work well enough against all targets and are currently limited in where they can be used in the body.\" In fact, all six of the FDA-approved siRNA drugs target hepatocytes in the liver.\n\n\"It's straightforward to get drugs into the liver, which serves as a filter for the body,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nSo, as a proof-of-concept, the team showed that not only could they deplete mouse liver cells of ALAS, leading to an increase in microRNAs, but doing so also enhanced the silencing activity of another model siRNA compound delivered to the mice.\n\nCoincidentally, one of the six approved siRNA drugs turns off ALAS1 to treat acute hepatic porphyrias. Dr. Yasuda and Dr. Desnick worked on the preclinical and clinical trials for the drug, which is known as givosiran. Since an siRNA against ALAS1 works effectively and safely in humans, this raises the possibility of combining such an agent to enhance other siRNA drugs. Dr. Lai notes that this strategy could be generally applicable to any siRNA.\n\nAnd if siRNA drugs can be made to work better, this could improve their cost-effectiveness, reduce side effects by making them effective at lower doses, and perhaps help to target additional cell types beyond liver cells, he adds.\n\nWhy discovery science matters\n\nIn December 2024, Harvard geneticist Gary Ruvkun, PhD, was awarded the Nobel Prize with Victor Ambros, PhD, for their joint discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation in the early 1990s. Dr. Lai did his undergraduate thesis research in Dr. Ruvkun's lab at that time (on another class of gene regulator) and credits him for launching his own career.\n\n\"I got my first real exposure to how science was actually done and gained lifelong interests in developmental biology and small RNAs,\" Dr. Lai says, adding that his mentor's recent accolade underscores the importance of curiosity-driven research.\n\n\"Dr. Ruvkun didn't start out looking for microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"Like Dr. Ambros, he was investigating the development of nematodes, these tiny worms that live in the soil. And not only did this unveil an entirely new paradigm for how genes are controlled, the field they started eventually resulted in a novel class of human therapies.\n\n\"When people ask why we're not spending all of our research dollars directly studying diseases like cancer, why we're funding research into cells and processes in model organisms like fruit flies, yeast, and bacteria -; this is a great example of how discovery science fuels the biggest breakthroughs,\" he continues. \"And I think it is especially critical to keep this conversation active, given how much uncertainty and disagreement there is in society and government about how much to publicly fund scientific research and in what areas. Hopefully, there will be continued support to keep the engine of foundational research strong.\"\n\nFunding and disclosures\n\nFunding for the research includes grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01DK134783, R01-GM083300, P30-CA008748); a Cooperative Centers of Excellence in Hematology pilot grant (10040500-05S1); and a NYSTEM training award (C32559GG).\n\nThe researchers have filed a patent application on their methods for enhancing the efficacy of RNAi therapy by targeting ALAS1/ALAS2 (WO2024148236A1).\n\nDrs. Yasuda and Desnick are also co-inventors of a patent for RNAi therapy of acute hepatic porphyrias. They also report pharmaceutical consulting work. Please see the study for full details."

            "article_content": "The latest AI model from OpenAI achieved an \u201cimpressive leap in performance\u201d but it still hasn\u2019t demonstrated what experts classify as human-level intelligence\n\nOpenAI announced a breakthrough achievement for its new o3 AI model Rokas Tenys / Alamy\n\nOpenAI\u2019s new o3 artificial intelligence model has achieved a breakthrough high score on a prestigious AI reasoning test called the ARC Challenge, inspiring some AI fans to speculate that o3 has achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI). But even as ARC Challenge organisers described o3\u2019s achievement as a major milestone, they also cautioned that it has not won the competition\u2019s grand prize \u2013 and it is only one step on the path towards AGI, a term for hypothetical future AI with human-like intelligence.\n\nThe o3 model is the latest in a line of AI releases that follow on from the large language models powering ChatGPT. \u201cThis is a surprising and important step-function increase in AI capabilities, showing novel task adaptation ability never seen before in the GPT-family models,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, an engineer at Google and the main creator of the ARC Challenge, in a blog post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat did OpenAI\u2019s o3 model actually do?\n\nChollet designed the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) Challenge in 2019 to test how well AIs can find correct patterns linking pairs of coloured grids. Such visual puzzles are intended to make AIs demonstrate a form of general intelligence with basic reasoning capabilities. But throwing enough computing power at the puzzles could let even a non-reasoning program simply solve them through brute force. To prevent this, the competition also requires official score submissions to meet certain limits on computing power.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s newly announced o3 model \u2013 which is scheduled for release in early 2025 \u2013 achieved its official breakthrough score of 75.7 per cent on the ARC Challenge\u2019s \u201csemi-private\u201d test, which is used for ranking competitors on a public leaderboard. The computing cost of its achievement was approximately $20 for each visual puzzle task, meeting the competition\u2019s limit of less than $10,000 total. However, the harder \u201cprivate\u201d test that is used to determine grand prize winners has an even more stringent computing power limit, equivalent to spending just 10 cents on each task, which OpenAI did not meet.\n\nThe o3 model also achieved an unofficial score of 87.5 per cent by applying approximately 172 times more computing power than it did on the official score. For comparison, the typical human score is 84 per cent, and an 85 per cent score is enough to win the ARC Challenge\u2019s $600,000 grand prize \u2013 if the model can also keep its computing costs within the required limits.\n\nSign up to our The Daily newsletter The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nBut to reach its unofficial score, o3\u2019s cost soared to thousands of dollars spent solving each task. OpenAI requested that the challenge organisers not publish the exact computing costs.\n\nDoes this o3 achievement show that AGI has been reached?\n\nNo, the ARC challenge organisers have specifically said they do not consider beating this competition benchmark to be an indicator of having achieved AGI.\n\nThe o3 model also failed to solve more than 100 visual puzzle tasks, even when OpenAI applied a very large amount of computing power toward the unofficial score, said Mike Knoop, an ARC Challenge organiser at software company Zapier, in a social media post on X.\n\nIn a social media post on Bluesky, Melanie Mitchell at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico said the following about o3\u2019s progress on the ARC benchmark: \u201cI think solving these tasks by brute-force compute defeats the original purpose\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile the new model is very impressive and represents a big milestone on the way towards AGI, I don\u2019t believe this is AGI \u2013 there\u2019s still a fair number of very easy [ARC Challenge] tasks that o3 can\u2019t solve,\u201d said Chollet in another X post.\n\nHowever, Chollet described how we might know when human-level intelligence has been demonstrated by some form of AGI. \u201cYou\u2019ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible,\u201d he said in the blog post.\n\nThomas Dietterich at Oregon State University suggests another way to recognise AGI. \u201cThose architectures claim to include all of the functional components required for human cognition,\u201d he says. \u201cBy this measure, the commercial AI systems are missing episodic memory, planning, logical reasoning and, most importantly, meta-cognition.\u201d\n\nSo what does o3\u2019s high score really mean?\n\nThe o3 model\u2019s high score comes as the tech industry and AI researchers have been reckoning with a slower pace of progress in the latest AI models for 2024, compared with the initial explosive developments of 2023.\n\nAlthough it did not win the ARC Challenge, o3\u2019s high score indicates that AI models could beat the competition benchmark in the near future. Beyond its unofficial high score, Chollet says many official low-compute submissions have already scored above 81 per cent on the private evaluation test set.\n\nDietterich also thinks that \u201cthis is a very impressive leap in performance\u201d. However, he cautions that, without knowing more about how OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3 models work, it is impossible to evaluate just how impressive the high score is. For instance, if o3 was able to practise the ARC problems in advance, then that would make its achievement easier. \u201cWe will need to await an open-source replication to understand the full significance of this,\u201d says Dietterich.\n\nThe ARC Challenge organisers are already looking to launch a second and more difficult set of benchmark tests sometime in 2025. They will also keep the ARC Prize 2025 challenge running until someone achieves the grand prize and open-sources their solution."

            "article_content": "OpenAI\n\nWhenever a company announces a fancy new AI feature, I think to myself...\n\n\"Wow, I can take a pic of a plate of sushi, turn it into a cartoon character, and make it dance with a single prompt.\"\n\nIncredible... Truly life-changing stuff. \ud83d\ude10\n\nSarcasm aside, OpenAI Sora is cool.\n\nAlso: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning\n\nBut I had to ask myself\u2026\n\n\"Self, how can I make a living with this?\"\n\nSo, if you've looked at these AI tools and thought:\n\n\"This is dope, but I got bills.\"\n\nI got you.\n\nIn this article, I'll share three ideas to turn Sora into cash flow and break down how I'd build a sustainable business.\n\nIf you stick around to the end, I'll share a little gift to make your life easier when using Sora to create content \ud83d\ude43.\n\nQuick Intro\n\nIf you're new to my work, I'm Lester Mapp, but my friends call me Les. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. At my core, though, I'm an award-winning performance marketer.\n\nNeedless to say, coming up with ideas and getting them to market is my thing.\n\nAlso: There's a new king of online shopping, and it's built an unstoppable monopoly\n\nOh, and if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts.\n\nNow that we have the pleasantries out of the way kick up your feet and get comfortable.\n\nWe're about to dive into a mini AI Shark Tank and say yes or no to some business ideas.\n\nBefore we jump into it, I need to bring you up to speed on Sora and why it is the next best thing since sliced bread (sliced bread that can dance; see what I did there \ud83d\ude0f).\n\nWhat is OpenAI Sora?\n\nOpenAI has changed the game yet again\u2026 this time for video creation.\n\nSure, other tools exist, but Sora fits my needs best now. Plus, those other tools aren't $20 a month and bundled with my ChatGPT Plus plan\u2026 so there's that.\n\nAlso: 15 surprising ways I used AI to save me weeks of work in 2024\n\nSo, what is Sora? Simply put, you type a prompt, and Sora generates high-quality video in minutes.\ud83c\udfac\n\nIt's truly mind-blowing stuff and set to redefine how content is created.\n\nUp until now, text-to-video has been tricky. Getting AI video to match with what's in your head isn't easy.\n\nHowever, Sora simplifies this by offering features that help you fine-tune your results. You can view the full prompts used to create any video, copy them, or remix them with slight tweaks to fit your vision.\n\nIt's like being able to tweak the answer on a test while the test is being graded\u2026 game changer! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nAlso: I'm an AI tools expert, and these are the only two I pay for\n\nSora is about more than just generating videos from scratch.\n\nIt can also:\n\nCombine multiple videos into one coherent scene\n\nAnimate still images like cartoons or illustrations\n\nModify existing videos seamlessly based on your prompt\n\nCreate stable, coherent videos without the usual AI morphing issues\n\nThis level of control and quality sets Sora apart. It keeps objects stable, even when obscured, and can generate different camera angles of a scene all from a single prompt. \ud83d\ude32\n\nWhile it's not perfect, Sora is a giant leap forward, and over time, it will get better and become more robust.\n\nHow is this possible\n\nI'm sure you're thinking, how is this even possible?\n\nAI magic. \ud83e\udd2a\n\nIf that wasn't a good enough answer, here's the short and oversimplified version.\n\nIn 2017, Google invented something called Transformer Architecture and published its findings. Transformers are a revolutionary neural network that dramatically improved AI's ability to understand, generate, and process complex sequential data, especially for natural language.\n\nOpenAI built on this foundation and developed powerful language models.\n\nThe result? ChatGPT.\ud83c\udf89\n\nAlso: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead\n\nBut then Google noticed that Transformer didn't just find patterns in text; it also found patterns in videos.\n\nOpenAI took that, expanded on it, combined it with its image generation work (like DALL-E 3), and boom, Sora was born.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nGoogle would be Alexander Graham Bell, who made the first phone.\n\nAnd OpenAI is Steve Jobs, who made the iPhone.\n\nWhile it's not a straight line from Google's work to Sora, it's a fascinating story of stacked innovations where each breakthrough builds on the last.\n\n3 ways I would make some money using Sora\n\n1. Become a prompt engineer\n\nA prompt engineer helps users create precise prompts to unlock Sora's full potential, generating high-quality videos for ads, tutorials, and more. This tech is powerful but needs finesse to get the best results. Since it's new, many people don't know how to use it, and plenty of them won't want to bother learning. That's where you come in.\n\nCreate a social profile on LinkedIn or Instagram to showcase your work and attract clients.\n\nProTip: Focus on a niche audience, like plumbers or real estate agents, and specialize your offer, i.e., marketing ads, educational videos, product demos, etc. You want to do this because you need to focus, especially in the early days, if you want meaningful results.\n\n2. Start an AI video creative agency\n\nA creative agency can use Sora to create finished videos for marketing campaigns, social media content, B-roll, and more. Unlike a prompt engineer who delivers text, agencies deliver polished, ready-to-use videos. Knowing your way around video editing is ideal, giving you more creative freedom to mix and match different scenes.\n\nTo get your first clients, start by talking to local small businesses and offering to create videos that promote their goods and services. I would literally knock on doors and show people my work.\n\nProtip: Do some free videos for local businesses in exchange for an honest review. Use those reviews to land paid clients. You're welcome.\n\n3. Use Sora for content creation\n\nThis one is my fav because I wouldn't need to talk to anyone -- lol. I would use Sora to create engaging video content for Instagram and YouTube. Leverage AI-generated visuals to enhance storytelling or educational content.\n\nMy favorite style is faceless YouTube videos, usually in a documentary format. I would use ChatGPT for scripting and Sora for visuals. For the voiceover, either do it yourself or use a natural-sounding AI voice.\n\nFocus on niches that pay the most per ad, like finance or business. Even though this is my favorite option, it takes longer to gain traction, so staying consistent is key.\n\nProtip: Master the art of storytelling. Good storytelling follows a \"simple\" framework called the hero's journey.\n\nOrdinary World \u2013 Introduce the current situation or status quo.\n\n\u2013 Introduce the current situation or status quo. Call to Adventure \u2013 Present an opportunity or problem that needs solving.\n\n\u2013 Present an opportunity or problem that needs solving. Crisis Challenges \u2013 Detail obstacles, challenges, or risks encountered.\n\n\u2013 Detail obstacles, challenges, or risks encountered. Results or Reward \u2013 Show the outcome, success, or transformation achieved.\n\nWrite that down; this format is an industry secret!\n\nMy two cents\n\nFirst off, thanks for coming to my TED talk. This was a long one, but now you know what Sora is and how you can pay some bills with it. \ud83c\udf93\n\nRegardless of the methods you choose, remember building a business is hard work, and while it may be hard, it's not impossible.\n\nSo, pick an idea and stick with it.\n\nAlso: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today\n\nKeep learning and growing; don't get emotional if things don't work out immediately.\n\nA mentor once told me, \"You can change the plan, but don't change the goal.\"\n\nLet me know which idea is your fav on LinkedIn.\n\nOh, I almost forgot the gift! Use this reference guide when creating prompts. These camera shots and movements will level up your Sora outputs.

            "article_content": "Trend: Sustainability\n\nThe South Korean government announced plans to mandate label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, replacing this with a digital QR code system over two years.\n\nSouth Korea has committed to a range of sustainability goals, including the slashing of plastic waste production by 50% and the doubling of recycling rates in the country from 34% to 70%, both by 2030.\n\nThe past few years have seen the Ministry of Environment (MoE) roll out a range of regulatory policies to this end, including the banning of hard-to-recycle plastics such as coloured PET from the recycling system as well as approving recycled PET plastic as material for new food packaging.\n\nThe ministry calling for public comment on another initiative earlier this year to mandate the use of label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, to be implemented after a two-year transition period.\n\n\u201cIn order to reduce the amount of label waste in the country from drinking water bottles and improve the efficiency of recycling systems locally, we will introduce a new label-free QR code system for all such bottles,\u201d MoE said via a formal statement.\n\nTrend: Sugar reduction\n\nThe Vietnamese government drafted regulations earlier this year proposing a phased increase on excise taxes for alcoholic beverages to 100% by 2030 as well as 10% for sugar-sweetened beverages, in attempts to curb overconsumption as well as boosting national income.\n\nVietnam is well-known for having very affordable alcoholic beverage prices, with beers in particular costing well below US$1 at most supermarkets and eateries.\n\nThe local government believes that such affordable prices have contributed to high consumption amongst consumers, and that it is now necessary to increase taxation on these drinks to ensure public health is not compromised.\n\n\u201cHigher taxation is necessary in order to reduce the consumption of alcohol in Vietnam,\u201d the local Ministry of Finance said via a formal statement outlining the draft regulations.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to gradually increase taxes to 100%, 70% and 100% eventually by 2030 \u2013 all of these are in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations to increase retail prices for alcohol by 10%.\u201d\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nThe general public and experts in Singapore raised several concerns over the consumption of cultivated meat, while also acknowledging it can play a crucial role in the City State\u2019s food security efforts.\n\nThese views were detailed in a study that aimed to investigate how both the public and experts perceive the risks and benefits of cultured meat on individual and societal levels.\n\nResearchers undertook four distinct online focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted between February and April 2022. Three FGDs involved participants from the general public, while the fourth included cultured meat experts. Each session, lasting approximately two hours, comprised nine to eleven participants.\n\nGiven Singapore\u2019s heavy reliance on imported food and its active promotion of novel food technology industries, including cultured meat, the market for such innovative foods is expanding, attracting more companies to the field.\n\nTrend: Viral trending product - Dubai Chocolate\n\nThe meteoric rise of FIX Dessert Chocolatier\u2019s chunky chocolate bars can be attributed to the growing influence of social media on purchasing decisions, exclusivity, and unique regional flavours, an analyst said earlier this year.\n\nFounded by Sarah Hamouda, the brand was launched in 2021 but only became viral this year \u2014 thanks to food influencer Maria Vehera, who filmed herself eating the chocolate bar and posted the video on TikTok, which garnered over 70 million views as of time of writing.\n\nSince then, people from all over the world shared their own reactions or tried to replicate the recipe at home, with the \u201cDubai chocolate fever\u201d spreading beyond the UAE to the US, Europe, and Asian countries like South Korea and Singapore.\n\nAccording to senior research analyst Monique Naval from Euromonitor International, this is the first time in recent years that a product from the Middle East has gained such global attention.\n\n\u201cWhile the Middle East has other unique chocolate offerings, such as chocolate-covered dates and camel chocolate, these have mostly been bought as souvenirs and their popularity have been rising organically over the years. In contrast, FIX\u2019s instant growth has been supported by social media and its limited production indicates exclusivity.\n\n\u201cThe increasing number of chocolatiers on social media has been driving consumer interest. With FIX\u2019s variety of filled chocolates going viral online, it showcases the growing influence of digital platforms in shaping modern confectionery trends,\u201d Naval told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nPlant-based dairy brands in India are continuing to steer away from using conventional dairy terms on their product labels until regulators issue greater clarity on what is permitted.\n\nBack in 2020 and 2021, the Food Safety and Standards Authority India (FSSAI) announced a ban on the use of conventional dairy terms such as \u2018milk\u2019 and \u2018cheese\u2019 for plant-based products. It also directed plant-based manufacturers to modify the product labels of all such products and e-commerce platforms to delist these as well.\n\nThis order was successfully stayed by the Delhi High Court later in 2021 after five companies took action. Despite this, industry uncertainty remains today.\n\n\u201cThe ban is essentially still a motion in hearing at the court level at this time,\u201d Rohit Jain, Co-Founder and CEO of Drums Food International which was one of the five companies that contributed to the initial ban being stayed, told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nTrend: Healthier innovations\n\nGlobal food and beverage giant Nestle had its eye on expanding its premium and healthy ageing product portfolios in search of a return to \u2018normalised\u2019 growth.\n\nNestle announced its FY2023 full year financial results, reporting a -1.5% year-on-year decrease in sales to CHF93bn (US$) but an increase of 17.3% in underlying trade operating profits to CHF16.1bn (US$).\n\nIn the firm\u2019s financial results press conference which FoodNavigator-Asia attended, Nestle CFO Francois-Xavier Roger highlighted that overall organic growth for the company has been estimated at a 7.2% growth year-on-year \u2013 but that this was made up of 7.5% pricing growth and -0.3% of what the company calls Real Internal Growth (RIG), which is a measurement of growth generated by volume and mix/innovation.\n\nAcknowledging this as an unsustainable means to long-term growth, Nestle CEO Mark Schneider told the floor that the firm was committed to move back to RIG-led growth in 2024, laying out several strategies towards this.\n\n\u201cThe food sector softness that has been seen over past two years globally has come from a food price increase spike that is the highest we have seen in some 50 years since 1973 to 1974, coming in at a 14.7% spike which is the highest since the 16.3% we saw back then,\u201d Schneider told us.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nPlant-based beverages may be considered suitable alternatives to their dairy counterparts but must overcome challenges related to flavour, consumer health, stability and nutrient dissolution, said researchers in Singapore, the UK and China.\n\nIn recent years, plant-based drinks have emerged as a diverse and popular choice, offering a range of nutritional benefits and catering to lactose-intolerant individuals, as well as vegans and vegetarians.\n\nNutrition-wise, plant-based drinks are said be a rich source of essential nutrients, including proteins, dietary fibre, fats, vitamins and minerals \u2014 beyond the calcium and protein associated with dairy milk.\n\nThese alternatives are typically derived from plant sources such as nuts, grains, legumes and seeds; examples include almond, soy, oat, rice and coconut drinks. Each variety usually has a unique flavour, texture, and nutritional composition, providing consumers with a broad array of choices to suit individual preferences and dietary needs.\n\nHowever, considerations such as amino acid profiles, digestibility and the presence of anti-nutritional factors should be taken into account.\n\nTrend: Sugar reduction\n\nMembers of the Philippines government called for regulations that would officially ban manufacturers from using added sugar as an ingredient in foods for young children aged three and below.\n\nSweetness and sugar features strongly in many Filipino foods and can be exemplified by one of the country\u2019s most popular desserts halo-halo, which is an amalgamation of various sweetened ingredients including pudding, ice cream, multiple sweetened beans and tubers, sweetened purple yam paste, jellies, cheese and more over crushed ice \u2013 and then commonly topped off with coconut milk, evaporated milk, syrups or sometimes even table sugar.\n\nThis culminated in the rapid rise of obesity and overweight individuals in the Philippines over the past two decades, according to the national science agency Department of Science and Technology (DOST)\n\nAs of 2022 some 27 million Filipinos were either overweight or obese, with the percentage of this having nearly doubled from 20.2% in 1998 to 36.6% in 2019. Even more alarmingly, similar findings were observed in the younger generation where adolescent obesity and overweight rates also nearly doubled from 4.9% in 2003 to 11.6% in 2018.\n\n\u201cRecent data has found that young Filipinos are at a greater risk of obesity, due to the consumption of food that is energy-dense and nutrient-poor, exacerbated by growing urbanisation and increased incomes,\u201d Senator Imee R. Marcos highlighted to the Senate earlier this year when tabling the bill calling for a ban on using added sugar in food products for young children.\n\n\u201cThe proposed bill seeks to ensure good nutrition, optimal child growth and development, and better health outcomes for children.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nSingapore cultivated seafood firm Umami Bioworks has highlighted its belief that strategic mergers are crucial to overcome doubts about the sector and achieve buy-in from major brands which can help the category scale-up.\n\nUmami Bioworks hit the news earlier this year for its merger with Shiok Meats, especially with both firms well-known for being cultivated seafood industry leaders and pioneers in their own right.\n\n\u201cThe M&A really came about when we saw that the market was unfortunately turning sour and sentiment was down during this trough of disillusionment period,\u201d Umami Bioworks CEO Mihir Pershad told FoodNavigator-Asia in an episode of our Food and Beverage Trailblazers podcast.\n\n\u201cWe know the market will come back once past this trough and that we will see recovery on the backside, but how good that recovery is and how long it will take is still to be seen so we needed to think about how to position the company to be in the best possible state to be the obvious choice for seafood industry incumbents to partner with both during this window and post-recovery.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nThe Thai government has published draft regulations on governance over the alternative proteins industry starting with the plant-based sector, and has suggested banning certain animal-related terms but allowing others.\n\nThis announcement was made by the Thailand Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Division earlier this year, which also established a special project research team to analyse types of standards and criteria that the regulations need to cover for the greatest efficiency.\n\n\u201cAt present, alternative protein products are seeing popularity amongst consumers and there are many such items on the market, but the control and supervision of the safety aspect of these in Thailand still has no clear direction,\u201d the Thai FDA stated via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cWe are embarking on a study of the current production and imports of alternative protein products in the country, and studying the related regulations [to apply this knowledge] in the development of regulations and standards in Thailand.\n\n\u201cThis will start with analysis of the plant-based protein sector in Thailand [before moving to] other alternative proteins such as insect-based, cultivated meat or fermentation.\u201d"

According to a recent Gartner report, 70% of companies that successfully apply observability will gain a competitive edge through faster problem identification and enhanced decision-making.\n\nHowever, as application development has progressed from monolith stacks to microservices, and user expectations have shifted toward instant digital experiences, companies have accumulated a mix of observability tools, each tailored to different parts of their tech stack. This hodgepodge raises costs, complicates data analysis, and slows issue resolution.\n\nThe Kloudfuse observability platform addresses these challenges by building on three foundational principles: unification, cost optimization, and intelligent automation. Here\u2019s a closer look at the observability landscape, the unique challenges organizations face today, and how Kloudfuse is designed to provide a unified, affordable, and intelligent approach to modern observability."

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will zoom by the sun on Tuesday during a record-breaking flyby, coming within 3.8 million miles (6.1 million kilometers) of the solar surface during humanity\u2019s closest approach to a star.\n\nThe uncrewed spacecraft will fly at 430,000 miles per hour (692,000 kilometers per hour), which is fast enough to reach Tokyo from Washington, DC, in under a minute, according to NASA. The speedy flyby will make the probe the fastest human-made object in history, the agency shared December 16 during a NASA Science Live presentation on YouTube.\n\nThe mission has been building up to this historic milestone since it launched on August 12, 2018 \u2014 an event attended by the probe\u2019s namesake, Dr. Eugene Parker, an astrophysicist who pioneered the solar research field of heliophysics.\n\nDr. Eugene Parker is pictured with a model of the Parker Solar Probe on May 31, 2017. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nParker was the first living person to have a spacecraft named after him. The astrophysicist, whose research revolutionized humanity\u2019s understanding of the sun and interplanetary space, died at age 94 in March 2022. But he was still able to witness how the spacecraft could help solve mysteries about the sun more than 65 years after the mission was originally envisioned.\n\nThe probe became the first spacecraft to \u201ctouch the sun\u201d by successfully flying through the sun\u2019s corona, or upper atmosphere, to sample particles and our star\u2019s magnetic fields in December 2021.\n\nOver the last six years of the spacecraft\u2019s seven-year mission, the Parker Solar Probe has collected data to enlighten scientists about some of the sun\u2019s greatest mysteries.\n\nHeliophysicists have long wondered how the solar wind, a constant stream of particles released by the sun, is generated as well as why the sun\u2019s corona is so much hotter than its surface.\n\nAn animation shows the solar wind streaming away from the sun, across the solar system and encountering Earth. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nScientists also want to understand how coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, are structured.\n\nWhen these ejections are aimed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of the planet\u2019s magnetic field, that can affect satellites as well as power and communication infrastructure on Earth.\n\nNow, the time has come for Parker\u2019s closest and final flybys, which could complete the answers to these enduring questions and uncover new mysteries by exploring uncharted solar territory.\n\n\u201cParker Solar Probe is changing the field of heliophysics,\u201d said Helene Winters, Parker Solar Probe\u2019s project manager from Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Applied Physics Laboratory, in a statement. \u201cAfter years of braving the heat and dust of the inner solar system, taking blasts of solar energy and radiation that no spacecraft has ever seen, Parker Solar Probe continues to thrive.\u201d\n\nA blisteringly close flyby of a fiery star\n\nParker\u2019s flyby at around 6:53 a.m. ET on Christmas Eve will be the first of the spacecraft\u2019s final three closest approaches, with the other two expected to occur on March 22 and June 19.\n\nThe spacecraft will be so close that if the distance between Earth and the sun were the length of an American football field, the spacecraft would be about 4 yards from the end zone, according to NASA.\n\nAt this proximity, the probe will be able to fly through plumes of plasma as well as within a solar eruption if one releases from the sun.\n\nThe spacecraft encountered a coronal mass ejection on September 5, 2022. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nThe spacecraft was built to withstand the extremes of the sun and has flown through coronal mass ejections in the past with no impact to the vehicle, said Parker Solar Probe project scientist Nour Rawafi.\n\nThe spacecraft is equipped with a carbon foam shield that is 4.5 inches (11.4 centimeters) thick and 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide. On Earth before launch, the shield was tested and able to withstand temperatures near 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (nearly 1,400 degrees Celsius). On Christmas Eve, the shield could face temperatures up to 1,800 F (980 degrees C).\n\nMeanwhile, the spacecraft\u2019s interior will be at a comfortable room temperature so the electronics systems and science instruments can operate as expected. A unique cooling system designed by the Applied Physics Laboratory pumps water through the craft\u2019s solar arrays to keep them at a steady temperature of 320 F (160 C), even during close approaches to the sun.\n\nAn animation depicts Parker Solar Probe's close pass near the intense heat of the sun. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nThe spacecraft will conduct its flyby autonomously because mission control will be out of contact with the probe due to its proximity to the sun.\n\nAfter the closest approach, around midnight between Thursday and Friday, Parker will send a signal called a beacon tone back to mission control to confirm the success of the flyby, Rawafi said.\n\nThe beacon tone is a limited piece of data that relays the overall state of the spacecraft, he said.\n\nThe immense set of data and images gathered during the flyby won\u2019t become available to mission control until Parker has moved away from the sun in its orbit, which will occur about three weeks later in mid-January, Rawafi said.\n\nPerfect timing to see an active sun\n\nJust over a year after the Parker Solar Probe first launched, the sun entered a new solar cycle. Now, as Parker makes its closest approach, the sun is experiencing solar maximum, meaning that the mission has had a chance to witness most of a solar cycle and the transitions between its highs and lows, said Dr. C. Alex Young, associate director for science in the Heliophysics Science Division at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nThe sun is much more active during solar maximum, as seen in this comparison of solar phases. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nScientists from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the international Solar Cycle Prediction Panel announced in October that the sun has reached solar maximum, or the peak of activity within its 11-year cycle.\n\nAt the peak of the solar cycle, the sun\u2019s magnetic poles flip, causing the sun to transition from calm to active. Experts track increasing solar activity by counting how many sunspots appear on the sun\u2019s surface. And the sun is expected to remain active for the next year or so.\n\nThe sun\u2019s increasing activity became obvious this year during two major displays of auroras on Earth in May and October, when coronal mass ejections released by the sun were directed at our planet. The solar storms are also responsible for generating auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky.\n\nAn array of colors can be seen during an auroral display visible from the International Space Station. NASA\n\n\u201cBoth of those storms caused auroras to be visible down to the very bottom of the United States,\u201d Young said. \u201cBut the May storm was an especially strong storm. In fact, we think it could be a 100- to possibly 500-year event, and that caused auroras very close to the equator, which is extremely unheard of. It was a worldwide event that millions and, hopefully billions, of people, were able to see, and it may not happen again.\u201d\n\nThe data gathered by Parker Solar Probe could enable scientists to better understand solar storms and even how to predict them, Young said.\n\n\u201cThe sun is the only star that we can see in detail, but we can actually go to and measure it directly,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s a laboratory in our solar system that allows us to learn about all the other stars in the universe and how all those stars interact with the billions and billions of other planets that may or may not be like our own planets in our solar system.\u201d\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will continue orbiting closely to the sun over the next six months. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nWith that in mind, Rawafi said he hopes that the sun puts on a spectacular show during the probe\u2019s close approaches, enabling scientists to gain insights into the sun\u2019s activity.\n\n\u201cSun, please do your best,\u201d Rawafi said. \u201cGive us the strongest event you can do, and the Parker Solar Probe can deal with it.\u201d"

            "article_content": "In everyday life, when things turn out the opposite of what you expect, it's usually cause for frustration. In science, it's often the starting point for discovery.\n\nThat's what happened to a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and their collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Their unexpected findings in the lab point to an opportunity to improve therapies that use small RNAs to silence disease-causing genes, potentially including those involved in cancer.\n\nSometimes you do an experiment. You think you're testing one idea, but when it doesn't turn out the way you planned, it can lead you to find something else that's much more interesting.\" Eric Lai, PhD, developmental biologist\n\nIn this case, the researchers -; led by Seungjae Lee, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Lai Lab at MSK's Sloan Kettering Institute -; were testing how a protein called ALAS1 helps to make small regulatory RNAs called microRNAs. When they removed the protein from cells, they expected to see levels of microRNAs drop.\n\n\"But instead, we were surprised to see them increase,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nThat counterintuitive result led to the discovery of an unrecognized role for ALAS1 beyond its well-known role in the production of heme. (Heme is an important player in many biological processes, including in oxygen transport -; giving hemoglobin its name -; in energy production, and in making microRNAs.)\n\nThe team's findings were published in Science, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals.\n\nHow little RNA snippets silence genes\n\nBoth microRNAs and the related class of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small snippets of RNA -; just 21 or 22 nucleotides long -; that bind to specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and repress them.\n\nThere's a bucket brigade of players that together convert longer RNA molecules into the tiny active products, and a key takeaway is that scientists have harnessed this knowledge to turn small RNAs into drugs that can silence genes that cause specific diseases.\n\nThe first siRNA drug, patisiran, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 to treat a debilitating genetic disorder called hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. A handful of additional siRNA drugs have been approved since, with more moving their way through clinical trials. Doctors see great potential to develop siRNA medicines against both rare diseases and more common ones (siRNA drugs are sometimes called RNAi drugs, meaning they work by interfering with messenger RNA accumulation).\n\nA moonlighting enzyme\n\nBack in the Lai Lab, Dr. Lee had discovered that upon removing ALAS1 from cells, they made more microRNAs. And further experiments showed that removing any of the other enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway did not affect microRNA levels.\n\n\"This told us that ALAS1 has another job outside of helping to make heme, which no one had realized,\" Dr. Lee says.\n\n\"We can consider this a 'moonlighting' function,\" Dr. Lai adds. \"And here we discovered that ALAS1 has this secret role regulating microRNAs that's not connected to its normal role in heme synthesis.\"\n\nPotential to make siRNA drugs work better\n\nThe discovery led the MSK researchers to partner with colleagues from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who specialize in heme regulation and ALAS genes -; Makiko Yasuda, MD, PhD, Robert Desnick MD, PhD, and postdoctoral fellow Sangmi Lee, PhD. This allowed the MSK researchers to extend their findings from cell culture into custom animal models that the Mount Sinai group were developing.\n\nAnd in mice, again, removing ALAS (specifically in liver cells) led to a global increase in microRNAs.\n\n\"The emerging picture is that ALAS acts as a brake on the production of microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"So we thought, now that we know how to remove this brake, maybe we can use that to improve the efficacy of siRNA drugs and their ability to silence their target genes.\"\n\nIn theory, this knowledge might help boost the activity of siRNA drugs against any problematic gene that is overactive in disease, Dr. Lai explains. Potentially this could include oncogenes known to drive cancer.\n\n\"But we're not quite there yet,\" he says. \"Therapeutic siRNA drugs don't work well enough against all targets and are currently limited in where they can be used in the body.\" In fact, all six of the FDA-approved siRNA drugs target hepatocytes in the liver.\n\n\"It's straightforward to get drugs into the liver, which serves as a filter for the body,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nSo, as a proof-of-concept, the team showed that not only could they deplete mouse liver cells of ALAS, leading to an increase in microRNAs, but doing so also enhanced the silencing activity of another model siRNA compound delivered to the mice.\n\nCoincidentally, one of the six approved siRNA drugs turns off ALAS1 to treat acute hepatic porphyrias. Dr. Yasuda and Dr. Desnick worked on the preclinical and clinical trials for the drug, which is known as givosiran. Since an siRNA against ALAS1 works effectively and safely in humans, this raises the possibility of combining such an agent to enhance other siRNA drugs. Dr. Lai notes that this strategy could be generally applicable to any siRNA.\n\nAnd if siRNA drugs can be made to work better, this could improve their cost-effectiveness, reduce side effects by making them effective at lower doses, and perhaps help to target additional cell types beyond liver cells, he adds.\n\nWhy discovery science matters\n\nIn December 2024, Harvard geneticist Gary Ruvkun, PhD, was awarded the Nobel Prize with Victor Ambros, PhD, for their joint discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation in the early 1990s. Dr. Lai did his undergraduate thesis research in Dr. Ruvkun's lab at that time (on another class of gene regulator) and credits him for launching his own career.\n\n\"I got my first real exposure to how science was actually done and gained lifelong interests in developmental biology and small RNAs,\" Dr. Lai says, adding that his mentor's recent accolade underscores the importance of curiosity-driven research.\n\n\"Dr. Ruvkun didn't start out looking for microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"Like Dr. Ambros, he was investigating the development of nematodes, these tiny worms that live in the soil. And not only did this unveil an entirely new paradigm for how genes are controlled, the field they started eventually resulted in a novel class of human therapies.\n\n\"When people ask why we're not spending all of our research dollars directly studying diseases like cancer, why we're funding research into cells and processes in model organisms like fruit flies, yeast, and bacteria -; this is a great example of how discovery science fuels the biggest breakthroughs,\" he continues. \"And I think it is especially critical to keep this conversation active, given how much uncertainty and disagreement there is in society and government about how much to publicly fund scientific research and in what areas. Hopefully, there will be continued support to keep the engine of foundational research strong.\"\n\nFunding and disclosures\n\nFunding for the research includes grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01DK134783, R01-GM083300, P30-CA008748); a Cooperative Centers of Excellence in Hematology pilot grant (10040500-05S1); and a NYSTEM training award (C32559GG).\n\nThe researchers have filed a patent application on their methods for enhancing the efficacy of RNAi therapy by targeting ALAS1/ALAS2 (WO2024148236A1).\n\nDrs. Yasuda and Desnick are also co-inventors of a patent for RNAi therapy of acute hepatic porphyrias. They also report pharmaceutical consulting work. Please see the study for full details."

            "article_content": "Today, the push for efficiency is more than just a goal- it's a necessity. Organizations are accelerating efforts to streamline processes, empower teams, and boost productivity to stay ahead of the curve. When workflows are streamlined, productivity increases, enabling organizations to scale effectively and adapt to the demands of an evolving market. AI is fundamentally centered on data\u2014training on the right data, ensuring secure access, and continuously refining this data is critical to meaningful AI-driven insights and automation success. Gartner predicts that by 2026, 30% of enterprises will automate over half of their network activities, reflecting a shift toward automation-driven efficiency. This trend not only enhances daily operations but also fosters a culture of growth and innovation, essential for staying competitive in a data-centric landscape.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nData services are an essential part of this transformation. They are persistent data storage services that bring powerful no-code data modeling and storage capabilities to your Robotic Process Automation (RPA) projects. Whether it\u2019s managing large data sets, automating data analysis, or simplifying access across departments, data services streamline the flow of information throughout an organization. They fit seamlessly into automation strategies, helping to reduce the manual effort needed for data handling and providing a foundation for predictive analytics, personalized customer experiences, and process improvements.\n\nThe Role of No-Code Data Services in Modern Automation\n\nTraditionally, handling data required technical expertise and complex configurations, which became even more challenging amid a talent shortage in automation-ready skills. No-code data services address this gap by offering a user-friendly approach that empowers business users, or citizen developers, to drive automation projects independently. Through simple, drag-and-drop functionality, data sets, files, and resources can be seamlessly incorporated into workflows without coding, while security and data consistency are maintained automatically.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAs organizations increasingly adopt automation, a no-code approach in data services becomes pivotal. It enables seamless integration with existing automation tools, allowing teams to manage, analyze, and access data across departments without relying heavily on IT support. By simplifying data handling, no-code data services make information more accessible and actionable, equipping organizations to provide real-time insights and solutions.\n\nA Practical Example: Monthly Financial Reporting\n\nIn monthly financial reporting, data from multiple systems, including bookings, invoices, billings, and payments, must be gathered. Without a centralized solution, both attended and unattended workflows retrieve data individually, requiring users to access all backend systems, leading to delays and potential inconsistencies. By setting up an unattended workflow to gather data in Data Service, other workflows can access this information consistently and efficiently. This eliminates the need for multiple data pulls, streamlines the reporting process, and mitigates issues related to data changes during the reporting cycle. Moreover, it removes the need to store aggregated data locally, enhancing data security and consistency across systems.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHow Enterprises Benefit from No-Code Data Services\n\nUnified Data Integration for Seamless Access: These services simplify the process of integrating data from disparate sources. By consolidating data from legacy platforms, enterprise systems, and custom applications into a single, secure repository, businesses can maintain data consistency and reliability across automations.\n\nStreamlined Data Reusability Across Automations: No-code data services offer a centralized data hub that makes information accessible and reusable across multiple automation projects. This eliminates the need for building separate connections for each workflow, enabling consistent data schemas and shareable variables through intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.\n\nScaling with Growth: As automation initiatives expand, the demand for scalable data solutions grows. No-code data services provide limitless capacity through secure platforms like Automation Cloud, allowing businesses to confidently scale their automation projects without sacrificing performance or security.\n\nEnhanced Security and Governance: Security remains a priority in a data-driven world. No-code data services help mitigate risks by transitioning sensitive information from local systems to a secure, centralized platform. With role-based access controls, organizations can manage data access and usage, ensuring that data governance remains intact.\n\nNo-Code as a Launchpad for Citizen Developers\n\nAdvertisment\n\nCitizen developers are crucial players in the digital transformation journey. Through no-code data services, employees in finance, marketing, HR, and customer service can independently create automated solutions, significantly enhancing productivity for themselves and their teams. With their deep understanding of daily operations and the potential impact of automation, they drive efficiency from the ground up, fostering continuous innovation and improvement.\n\nBy 2025, Gartner anticipates that 70% of new enterprise applications will harness low-code or no-code technologies\u2014a significant move reshaping the future of software development. This shift isn\u2019t just about innovation; it's a game-changer, empowering teams to drive transformation at pace, with greater flexibility and responsiveness. As organizations embrace these dynamic solutions, they\u2019re not only streamlining operations but also paving the way for transformative breakthroughs that redefine their impact.\n\nAttributed to Prashant Momaya, Senior Director of Sales Engineering, UiPath India"

            "article_content": "The latest AI model from OpenAI achieved an \u201cimpressive leap in performance\u201d but it still hasn\u2019t demonstrated what experts classify as human-level intelligence\n\nOpenAI announced a breakthrough achievement for its new o3 AI model Rokas Tenys / Alamy\n\nOpenAI\u2019s new o3 artificial intelligence model has achieved a breakthrough high score on a prestigious AI reasoning test called the ARC Challenge, inspiring some AI fans to speculate that o3 has achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI). But even as ARC Challenge organisers described o3\u2019s achievement as a major milestone, they also cautioned that it has not won the competition\u2019s grand prize \u2013 and it is only one step on the path towards AGI, a term for hypothetical future AI with human-like intelligence.\n\nThe o3 model is the latest in a line of AI releases that follow on from the large language models powering ChatGPT. \u201cThis is a surprising and important step-function increase in AI capabilities, showing novel task adaptation ability never seen before in the GPT-family models,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, an engineer at Google and the main creator of the ARC Challenge, in a blog post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat did OpenAI\u2019s o3 model actually do?\n\nChollet designed the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) Challenge in 2019 to test how well AIs can find correct patterns linking pairs of coloured grids. Such visual puzzles are intended to make AIs demonstrate a form of general intelligence with basic reasoning capabilities. But throwing enough computing power at the puzzles could let even a non-reasoning program simply solve them through brute force. To prevent this, the competition also requires official score submissions to meet certain limits on computing power.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s newly announced o3 model \u2013 which is scheduled for release in early 2025 \u2013 achieved its official breakthrough score of 75.7 per cent on the ARC Challenge\u2019s \u201csemi-private\u201d test, which is used for ranking competitors on a public leaderboard. The computing cost of its achievement was approximately $20 for each visual puzzle task, meeting the competition\u2019s limit of less than $10,000 total. However, the harder \u201cprivate\u201d test that is used to determine grand prize winners has an even more stringent computing power limit, equivalent to spending just 10 cents on each task, which OpenAI did not meet.\n\nThe o3 model also achieved an unofficial score of 87.5 per cent by applying approximately 172 times more computing power than it did on the official score. For comparison, the typical human score is 84 per cent, and an 85 per cent score is enough to win the ARC Challenge\u2019s $600,000 grand prize \u2013 if the model can also keep its computing costs within the required limits.\n\nSign up to our The Daily newsletter The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nBut to reach its unofficial score, o3\u2019s cost soared to thousands of dollars spent solving each task. OpenAI requested that the challenge organisers not publish the exact computing costs.\n\nDoes this o3 achievement show that AGI has been reached?\n\nNo, the ARC challenge organisers have specifically said they do not consider beating this competition benchmark to be an indicator of having achieved AGI.\n\nThe o3 model also failed to solve more than 100 visual puzzle tasks, even when OpenAI applied a very large amount of computing power toward the unofficial score, said Mike Knoop, an ARC Challenge organiser at software company Zapier, in a social media post on X.\n\nIn a social media post on Bluesky, Melanie Mitchell at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico said the following about o3\u2019s progress on the ARC benchmark: \u201cI think solving these tasks by brute-force compute defeats the original purpose\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile the new model is very impressive and represents a big milestone on the way towards AGI, I don\u2019t believe this is AGI \u2013 there\u2019s still a fair number of very easy [ARC Challenge] tasks that o3 can\u2019t solve,\u201d said Chollet in another X post.\n\nHowever, Chollet described how we might know when human-level intelligence has been demonstrated by some form of AGI. \u201cYou\u2019ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible,\u201d he said in the blog post.\n\nThomas Dietterich at Oregon State University suggests another way to recognise AGI. \u201cThose architectures claim to include all of the functional components required for human cognition,\u201d he says. \u201cBy this measure, the commercial AI systems are missing episodic memory, planning, logical reasoning and, most importantly, meta-cognition.\u201d\n\nSo what does o3\u2019s high score really mean?\n\nThe o3 model\u2019s high score comes as the tech industry and AI researchers have been reckoning with a slower pace of progress in the latest AI models for 2024, compared with the initial explosive developments of 2023.\n\nAlthough it did not win the ARC Challenge, o3\u2019s high score indicates that AI models could beat the competition benchmark in the near future. Beyond its unofficial high score, Chollet says many official low-compute submissions have already scored above 81 per cent on the private evaluation test set.\n\nDietterich also thinks that \u201cthis is a very impressive leap in performance\u201d. However, he cautions that, without knowing more about how OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3 models work, it is impossible to evaluate just how impressive the high score is. For instance, if o3 was able to practise the ARC problems in advance, then that would make its achievement easier. \u201cWe will need to await an open-source replication to understand the full significance of this,\u201d says Dietterich.\n\nThe ARC Challenge organisers are already looking to launch a second and more difficult set of benchmark tests sometime in 2025. They will also keep the ARC Prize 2025 challenge running until someone achieves the grand prize and open-sources their solution."

            "article_content": "2024 has seen significant global conflicts, including the Israel-Hamas war, instability in the Sahel, and the emerging Yemen-Israel confrontation. These conflicts have caused immense loss of life, displacement, and geopolitical shifts, with far-reaching global consequences.\n\nAs 2024 draws to a close, the world has been shaken by several major conflicts that have not only affected the countries involved but have also had far-reaching consequences for global security and geopolitics. Below is a detailed overview of the six biggest global conflicts that dominated headlines throughout the year:\n\n1. Israel-Hamas War and Regional Escalation\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war, which began in October 2023, entered a new and dangerous phase in 2024. The conflict escalated into a broader regional crisis with Israel conducting extensive airstrikes in Gaza. The year saw a massive humanitarian crisis unfold, with the death toll surpassing 25,000 civilians on both sides by December 2024.\n\nIn September 2024, the violence expanded as Israel\u2019s retaliatory strikes targeted Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, igniting the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, while Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza escalated into a full-blown Iran-Israel war when Israeli forces targeted the Iranian consulate in Syria. This regional war raised concerns about broader Middle Eastern stability, especially with Iran\u2019s proxy forces becoming increasingly involved in the conflict.\n\nThe international community, including the United Nations and major powers like the United States, attempted to broker peace talks, but the military engagements persisted. This conflict has exposed deepening divisions in the region and further complicated global efforts for peace.\n\n2. Syrian Civil War and Regime Change\n\nThe Syrian Civil War, which has been ongoing for over a decade, saw a dramatic shift in 2024. After years of fighting between the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and various rebel factions, the war reached a boiling point. In November 2024, the Assad regime, which had managed to hold on to power with Russian and Iranian support, finally collapsed due to internal strife and mounting pressure from rebel forces and international sanctions.\n\nWith Assad fleeing the country in December 2024, the Syrian government entered into a power vacuum, allowing various factions to vie for control. Islamist militant groups have taken advantage of the turmoil, and there have been reports of attempts to establish an Islamic state, complicating the region\u2019s stability.\n\nThe international community now faces the challenge of rebuilding Syria and addressing the humanitarian disaster that has left millions displaced. The ongoing conflict has also put pressure on neighboring countries, including Turkey and Lebanon, which have been affected by refugee flows and cross-border insurgency.\n\n3. Ukraine Conflict Intensifies\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which began in 2022, has been one of the most significant geopolitical events of the decade. In 2024, the conflict saw no signs of abating, with Russia continuing to push back against Ukrainian forces despite intense international sanctions and military aid to Ukraine. As of December 2024, the war had caused over 400,000 casualties and displaced millions of civilians, both internally and across Europe.\n\nIn 2024, Russia\u2019s attempts to capture key Ukrainian cities were met with stiff resistance. Ukraine\u2019s military, armed with advanced weaponry from NATO countries, managed to retake several regions, including parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, which had been under Russian control for years. Meanwhile, Russian forces bombarded civilian infrastructure, causing widespread suffering.\n\nThe conflict\u2019s broader implications have been far-reaching: the European Union and NATO have had to deal with the massive refugee crisis, and the war has caused disruptions to global food and energy supplies, especially grain exports from Ukraine. Diplomacy efforts have continued, but peace remains elusive.\n\n4. Sudanese Civil War\n\nSudan\u2019s descent into civil war in 2023 reached a breaking point in 2024. After months of violent clashes between military factions and rebel groups, the country was embroiled in a full-scale conflict that has devastated its infrastructure and economy. As of 2024, the conflict has led to over 50,000 deaths, with millions more displaced.\n\nThe war began in April 2023 when tensions between the Sudanese military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led to violent fighting in Khartoum. Despite efforts by the African Union and United Nations to broker a ceasefire, the conflict has only intensified throughout 2024. The RSF, a militia accused of war crimes, has expanded its reach, and major battles are now fought across Darfur and other regions.\n\nThe crisis has led to a humanitarian catastrophe, with food and medical supplies running low. Neighboring countries like Egypt and Ethiopia have faced increased pressure from the influx of refugees. The international community has called for an urgent resolution, but the road to peace in Sudan remains unclear.\n\n5. Myanmar Civil War\n\nMyanmar has been in a state of turmoil since the military coup in February 2021. The junta ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, and widespread protests turned into a violent insurgency. In 2024, the situation has only worsened, with the military junta facing fierce resistance from ethnic armed groups and pro-democracy militias, known as the People\u2019s Defense Forces (PDF).\n\nThe conflict has led to severe human rights violations, with reports of extrajudicial killings, mass displacement, and destruction of villages. As of December 2024, Myanmar is teetering on the brink of a full-scale civil war. The military\u2019s strategy of targeting civilian populations has drawn international condemnation, and the United Nations has urged the international community to impose stronger sanctions on Myanmar\u2019s military leaders.\n\nDespite international pressure, Myanmar\u2019s military junta shows no sign of backing down. The conflict has caused a massive refugee crisis, with many fleeing to neighboring Thailand and Bangladesh. The continued fighting has undermined efforts to bring peace to the country, and the situation remains dire.\n\n6. Yemen-Israel Conflict\n\nThe Yemen-Israel conflict reached a new and alarming phase in 2024, as the Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, began launching targeted missile strikes on Israeli ships and infrastructure. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have long been opposed to Israeli interests, largely due to their allegiance with Iran, which maintains an ideological and political rivalry with Israel.\n\nIn 2024, the Houthis escalated their attacks against Israeli assets in the Red Sea, a crucial maritime route, threatening global trade. Israel retaliated with military airstrikes on Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, marking a dramatic turn in this conflict. Israel\u2019s naval forces, bolstered by increased security measures, were deployed to safeguard key trade routes vital for Israel\u2019s economy and defense.\n\nThe conflict has raised the stakes for regional powers, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which have traditionally been aligned against both Iran and the Houthis. With increased attacks on commercial vessels and mounting tensions between Israel and Iranian-backed factions, the Yemen-Israel conflict has the potential to spill over into a broader regional war involving multiple countries. The situation has caused widespread concern for international shipping security and global energy markets, especially in the volatile Red Sea region.\n\n2024 has been a year marked by significant global conflicts that have caused immense loss of life, displacement, and geopolitical shifts. From the escalating Israel-Hamas war to the widespread instability in the Sahel, and the emerging Yemen-Israel confrontation, the world has witnessed conflicts that have not only affected the countries involved but have also had far-reaching global consequences. While diplomatic efforts continue in many of these regions, the resolution of these conflicts remains a distant hope. As the world moves into 2025, these crises will continue to demand attention from the international community in their quest for peace and stability."

We see a wide range of successful use cases across diverse industries, including financial services, manufacturing, healthcare, travel and tourism, and high-tech. We have several case studies from brands such as Volkswagen in automotive, Unobravo in health care, Pllay in entertainment, and easyJet in travel and tourism.\n\nThese companies are looking to innovate, enhance customer experiences, and stay competitive in the digital landscape. The MACH stack\u2019s modular, flexible, and integrated approach makes it an appealing choice for businesses across diverse industries.\n\nThe growing adoption of the MACH stack across various sectors signals a strong market shift towards more agile and responsive systems that can accommodate a wide range of business needs and use cases.\n\nWhat obstacles did the Alliance solve along the way?\n\nRasmussen: MACH\u2019s initial use cases were limited to e-commerce and retail, but through the launch of our Industry Advisory Board earlier this year, the Alliance was able to leverage the experience and insights of knowledgeable industry leaders to develop the best path for expansion to wider industries and geographic markets.\n\nThis ongoing effort to broaden the MACH market and diversify the Alliance\u2019s focus has attracted several new member organizations outside of e-commerce. One such member is J.P. Morgan.\n\nWhat lies ahead for the Alliance?\n\nRasmussen: In July 2024, the Alliance established a Community Council of volunteers from its member organizations to champion collaboration, innovation, and diversity. It will work to expand the organization\u2019s membership and diversify it by forging alliances with industry associations, technology vendors, and consultancies.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, we want to expand Alliance membership into new and adjacent technology categories. The focus remains on ensuring MACH-certified vendors uphold our core criteria and commitment to the market.\n\nIn January, we will release our 5th Global Annual Research Report that speaks to over 500 brands across North America, the U.K./Europe, and APAC to better understand the evolving landscape of technology infrastructures. It looks at key topics and challenges for these leading brands to help understand the trends and insights related to adopting a MACH/Composable approach and achieving competitive advantages.\n\nAll this comes together at The Composable Conference by the MACH Alliance in Chicago in April 2025. This conference will provide tailored insights for attendees at any stage of their MACH journey."

            "article_content": "Home News James' Ossuary unveiled in new 'World of Jesus' exhibit with over 350 artifacts from Holy Land\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Standing in front of a small stone ossuary bearing the inscription \"James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus,\" Oded Golan gestures with quiet reverence.\n\nThe box, he explains, once held human bones. Now, it holds stories from 2,000 years ago that are now on display at Pullman Yards, where an extraordinary exhibit titled \"Discovering the World of Jesus: Ancient Treasures from the Holy Land\" opened on Dec 3.\n\nThe exhibition, showcasing over 350 artifacts from the private Golan Collection, promises visitors a visceral journey through the time of Jesus, from His birth to the Resurrection.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nFor Golan, an Israeli engineer and antiquities collector, the exhibit reflects a life-long passion.\n\n\"I started collecting antiquities at the age of 9,\" he said, recounting his discovery of what would later be identified as the earliest dictionary in the world, written in cuneiform.\n\n\"Israel is the best place to search for antiquities. Every stone, every object has a story to tell.\"\n\nFor the first time, Golan's renowned collection has left Israel to embark on a U.S. tour, offering visitors a rare opportunity to connect with objects illuminating the daily lives, culture and faith of those who lived in Jesus' time.\n\n\n\nAmong the highlights in the exhibit are ossuaries attributed to James, Jesus' brother, and the priest Zacharias, believed to be the father of John the Baptist. Among hundreds of other objects are lamps, sandals, coins, and even stone vessels that are thought to resemble the cup used during the Last Supper.\n\n\n\n\"We have the earliest images of the Nativity story from a church from the fourth century A.D., and the earliest description of the Holy Sepulcher, the place where the tradition claims the place where Jesus' body was put into the cave and then resurrected,\" Golan, who is Jewish, said.\n\n\n\nJames Tabor, a retired professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and a scholar of Christian origins, told CP the exhibit bridges a crucial gap between text and history.\n\n\n\n\"It's fabulous,\" he said. \"As a historian, I work primarily with texts \u2014 Dead Sea Scrolls, manuscripts. But when you combine those texts with archaeology, it's transformative.\"\n\n\n\nTabor, who has excavated in Israel for decades, sees the exhibit's immersive approach as a game-changer. Rather than presenting artifacts in isolation, \"Discovering the World of Jesus\" tells a chronological story complemented by audio and visual effects.\n\n\n\n\"You walk through history, from Herod the Great to the crucifixion and beyond. You get a feel for what life was like. What lamps did they use? What dishes did they eat from? How did they bury their dead? This exhibit answers those questions in ways no textbook can,\" he explained.\n\nFor many visitors, the exhibit promises to challenge long-held assumptions. For example, the manger in which Jesus is said to have been laid at birth was likely not a wooden crib, but a stone trough.\n\n\"These artifacts correct misconceptions we don't even know we have,\" Tabor said. \"The Bible comes alive in a tangible, material way.\"\n\nNo artifact stirs more awe than the James Ossuary, whose Aramaic inscription identifies it as belonging to \"James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.\"\n\nIts authenticity, Golan explained, has been verified through rigorous chemical and microscopic testing, which confirm the inscription dates to the first century. Still, skeptics have debated its significance, questioning whether this James is the same man identified in the Gospels as Jesus' brother.\n\nDespite the debate, Tabor said the statistical evidence surrounding the ossuary is compelling.\n\n\n\n\"We've analyzed the likelihood of someone with this combination of names living in Jerusalem at the time. It's extremely rare. The probability is overwhelming that this is the James from the New Testament,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe stressed that the ossuary also serves as a rare physical link to Jesus' family.\n\n\n\n\"If this is James' ossuary, then his family members likely stood before it, mourning his death,\" Tabor said. \"It's the closest thing we have to a direct connection with Jesus.\"\n\n\n\nThe exhibit also serves as an immersive, family-friendly experience. Visitors will encounter ancient coins minted by Pontius Pilate, crucifixion nails that highlight the brutality of Roman execution and sandals worn by children in first century Judea. A short film, \"Daily Life in the Time of Jesus,\" offers a visual narrative that complements the artifacts.\n\n\n\nOne particularly striking piece is a stone cup, similar to the one used during the Last Supper. Golan said the cup \"wasn't made of gold or covered in diamonds, as some might imagine.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was a simple stone cup, used during Passover by Jewish people in Jerusalem,\" Golan said. \"The specific one we display has traces of fire damage, possibly from the destruction of Jerusalem, just as Jesus predicted during His life.\"\n\nGolan contended that the pieces are keys to understanding a shared past and bringing the Bible to life in a powerful way.\n\n\"When you hold an artifact from the time of Jesus, you are connecting with history in a deeply personal way,\" he says. \"You can almost feel the lives of the people who made them.\"\n\nTabor agreed, emphasizing the significance of immersing oneself in Bible history.\n\n\"When my students excavate in Israel and pick up a lamp or a shard of pottery, they're often amazed. 'Could Jesus have touched this?' they ask,\" Tabor stated. \"It's a profound moment. This exhibit captures that feeling for everyone.\"\n\nGolan hopes the exhibit will inspire curiosity and deepen understanding, regardless of one's religious beliefs.\n\n\"This isn't just for Christians,\" he said. \"Jesus was a Jewish man who lived in a Jewish world. Understanding his time helps us understand the shared roots of our faith and history.\"\n\nAt the end of the exhibit, visitors are invited to write prayers and leave them on a symbolic tree. These prayers will be transported to a church in Galilee, near where Jesus is believed to have grown up. Golan said the tree serves as a fitting conclusion to a journey that begins with ancient artifacts and ends with a personal connection to faith and history.\n\n\"Jesus lived in a real world. This exhibit helps us see that world \u2014 the sights, the sounds, the objects \u2014 and that makes the story more human, more powerful, and more real,\" Tabor said.\n\n\"Discovering the World of Jesus: Ancient Treasures from the Holy Land\" is now open at Pullman Yards in Atlanta. Tickets are now available online, with additional U.S. tour stops to be announced in the coming months."

The rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa\n\nHe has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansj\u00fcrgen K\u00f6hler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (CENAP), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says K\u00f6hler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office CENAP.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nAccording to its director, CENAP has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, K\u00f6hler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact for observers of the inexplicable\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, K\u00f6hler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe founded CENAP as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand.\"\n\nThe organization, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to CENAP has changed dramatically over the decades, K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese Lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nNumber of reports spike thanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organization recorded over 850 cases by October 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups - rocket ignitions - in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun,\" K\u00f6hler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, CENAP records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nThe organization also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the CENAP director.\n\nDo only conspiracy theorists report UFO sightings?\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, K\u00f6hler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship ... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nK\u00f6hler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organization is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nK\u00f6hler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life - or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth.\"\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\"\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa"

            "article_content": "In the modern world of technology, two transformative forces are converging: languages, generative AI, and quantum computing. While each of these domains will revolutionise industries on its own, their combined capabilities present an order of magnitude advance in data simulation and predictive modelling. This blog explores how generative AI, particularly with the expertise of a Generative AI Development Company, is unlocking new frontiers in quantum computing, addressing challenges, and creating pathways for revolutionary applications.\n\nWhat is Quantum Computing?\n\nQuantum computing is a new way of computing that utilises principles of quantum physics as the basis for calculations. Quantum computers unlike classical computers deal with quantum bits or qubits instead of the standard binary equivalents (0 and 1). Qubits can be in the state of 0 or 1 at the same time, which is superposition and can also be connected in couples so that the other\u2019s state also changes, entanglement, which makes for a hell of a lot more computation power.\n\nKey Features of Quantum Computing:\n\n\u2013 Superposition: The facility of the device to do several operations at the same time.\n\n\u2013 Entanglement: Coherent states of qubits that enhance computational speed.\n\n\u2013 Quantum Tunnelling: Helps to identify the solutions for difficult optimisation problems within the shortest time.\n\nAs the field of quantum computing is relatively young, its ability to address tasks that are unfeasible for classical computing has attracted interest around the world.\n\nAI\u2019s Role in Quantum Simulations\n\nQuantum systems have high levels of complexity and dynamics that are not easily understood and described analytically. It is at this juncture that generative artificial intelligence has come into the picture. Generative AI with the help of complex algorithms can mimic quantum systems, forecast their behavior, and can suggest the best design for quantum circuits.\n\nHow Generative AI Enhances Quantum Simulations:\n\n\u2013 Modelling Quantum Behaviour: Models of generative learning including GANs and VAEs can simulate quantum states and the influence of these states as well with high levels of precision.\n\n\u2013 Data Augmentation: Appreciably, generative AI can generate simulations of quantum data to help developers train quantum algorithms better.\n\n\u2013 Circuit Optimisation: With the help of machine learning, settings in quantum circuits can be determined that make their functioning as effective as possible and reduce the probability of errors.\n\n\u2013 Predictive Insights: There are multiple cases where the results of quantum computations are expected by certain models sustained by artificial intelligence to avoid continuous computing applying much time and effort.\n\nThis integration demands expertise often provided by a Generative AI Development Company that understands the nuances of both quantum computing and artificial intelligence.\n\nApplications of Generative AI in Quantum Computing\n\nThe cooperation between generative AI and quantum computing has given birth to great opportunities to transform the markets. Below are some key areas where their integration is proving transformative:\n\n1. Cryptography\n\nQuantum computers are a concern to traditional cryptographic encryption because they can break ciphers. However, generative AI might help in creating the proper quantum-safe cryptography methods for maintaining cyber security within the quantum age.\n\n2. Material Science\n\nIt has been said that to comprehend materials and even to create novel ones, it is necessary to model interactions of atoms, an inadequacy that can be solved by the use of quantum machines. This makes generative AI capable of speeding up these simulations so that scientists can find new potential materials for semiconductors, renewable energy, and much more.\n\n3. Drug Discovery\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry struggles to model molecular structures and interactions. Incidentally, generative deep learning coupled with quantum computing can mimic these interactions at a greatly accelerated pace leading to the development of these essential drugs.\n\n4. Financial Modelling\n\nLarge and mixed data collections and complicated connections are part of complex financial systems. Quantum computing combined with generative AI can capture the dynamics and associated risks that render efficient decision-making systems.\n\n5. Climate Modelling\n\nQuantum-driven simulations can further be applied by generative AI to analyse climate systems and changes that can support the world in designing strategic approaches toward climate change.\n\nChallenges and Limitations\n\nWhile the opportunities are tremendous, there are some important challenges that have to be solved before harmonising generative AI with quantum computing.\n\n1. Technical Scalability\n\nQuantum computers are still in their experimental stage, with small numbers of qubits and relatively greater error rates. The biggest issue, of course, is extending these systems to be capable of addressing real-world phenomena.\n\n2. Data Complexity\n\nGenerally, random quantum data is very large and it is difficult for AI systems to comprehend and apply or analyse for that matter. Supervised generative AI for quantum data required computing capacity to be trained at a very high level.\n\n3. Resource Requirements\n\nQuantum computing and generative artificial intelligence both use resources. Creating infrastructure that facilitates their integration calls for large hardware and knowledge investments.\n\n4. Ethical Considerations\n\nThe capabilities of quantum-advanced intelligent applications are ethically questionable, especially about surveillance, privacy, and weapons. To this end, countering these issues remains important to exercise responsible innovation.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nAI integration with generative AI and quantum computing could transform more than one sector. Here is a glimpse of what the future may hold:\n\n1. Cybersecurity\n\nSophisticated quantum cryptography techniques created with generative AI could change the approach that the information is protected from future sophisticated threats.\n\n2. Energy Optimisation\n\nQAI is used to predict energy systems with incredible accuracy and help revolutionise renewable energy and grid integration.\n\n3. Healthcare Revolution\n\nRanging from individualised medications to enhanced diagnosis equipment, the association of quantum composite and generative Artificial Intelligence might result in improvements to the practice of medical facilities.\n\n4. Scientific Research\n\nGenerative AI Development Services are already helping researchers model quantum phenomena more efficiently. It is anticipated that as the technology progresses, there will be additional exciting findings in fundamental physics and beyond.\n\n5. Industrial Innovation\n\nExamples of sectors that could be positively impacted through the implementation of a more efficient methodical approach and forecasting by methods of quantum-augmented AI include manufacturing, AI in logistics, and many others.\n\nThe Role of Generative AI Development Companies\n\nThe gap between AI and quantum computing is bridged by Specialised Generative AI Development Companies. These companies provide customised Generative AI Development Services, ensuring businesses can use the potential of these technologies effectively. They are invaluable when it comes to creating AI models that mimic quantum systems, right through to implementing these solutions into configurations.\n\nFAQ\n\n1. How does generative AI support quantum computing?\n\nQuantitative AI models emulate quantum processes, improve circuits, and forecast results, contributing massively to quantum computation advancements.\n\n2. What industries benefit most from AI and quantum computing integration?\n\nIndustries including banking, material science, cybersecurity, and healthcare find the most transforming results.\n\n3. What are the challenges in merging generative AI with quantum computing?\n\nFour significant limitations include scalability, resource needs, data properties and characteristics, and ethical issues will be discussed.\n\n4. How can businesses utilise generative AI in quantum computing?\n\nBy partnering with a Generative AI Development Company to access customised Generative AI Development Services for their specific needs.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe integration of generative AI and quantum computing lies beyond the technological world; it is an architectural shift in how we practice computation, simulation, as well as innovation. However, there is still much work to be done because together, these technologies are capable of doing things we never thought possible across industries. With the guidance of a Generative AI Development Company and access to innovative Generative AI Development Services, businesses, and researchers can stay ahead in this transformative era."
