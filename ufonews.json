            "source": "NJ.com",
            "article_content": "My cats are not usually picky about much, but they hate one thing: a traditional water bowl.\n\nThey\u2019d rather not drink water at all if it\u2019s not moving. So much so, that my one cat wound up developing crystals and had to have emergency surgery to remove a blockage. How dramatic!\n\nBut thankfully they both love water fountains. They liked the Petlibro fountain I originally got, but it pales in comparison to how much they like this BUETEKA water fountain from Chewy. I\u2019d like to think it is because it is shaped like a UFO and they are just two tiny aliens who live in my home.\n\nMy cats, Luna and Sirius, have expensive tastes. They\u2019re on a wet-food exclusive prescription diet, have two different Litter Robots to do their business, and they liked the $50 water fountain significantly more than the $30 one I originally bought.\n\nThey must get their expensive taste from me, their mother, because I liked this fountain more, as well.\n\nMy initial reason for liking the BUETEKA water fountain more was simply aesthetics. I bought this because it is a cute little UFO. It also has near-excellent reviews: 4.5 stars and nearly 500 ratings on Chewy. Over 80% of the people who own this love it so much, they gave it 5 stars, and I am also someone who\u2019d rate it 5 stars.\n\nBUETEKA Cat Water Fountain Features\n\nThis Chewy cat water fountain has a number of features that stand out, including:\n\nA unique catnip ball dispenser\n\nA 1.6L water tank\n\n2 water flow modes and an adjustable water outlet pipe\n\nA visible water-level indicator\n\nAn ultra-quiet smart pump\n\nMultiple filters that help to sterilize the water and remove hair, debris, and impurities\n\nA small footprint: 7.87 inches L x 7.87 inches W x 8.27 inches H\n\nWe don\u2019t use the catnip ball in the dispenser, because Luna and Sirius get rowdy enough in the middle of the night, the last thing I need is catnip hyping them up for 3 AM zoomies.\n\nThe water level indicator makes it very easy to spot how much water is in the fountain, so you know when it is low and needs to be refilled. Between my two cats, I typically only need to refill it twice a week.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a cat water fountain?\n\nIf you own a cat, you\u2019ve probably spotted them trying to drink water from the faucet once or twice. Sirius used to love doing this. Cats like moving water, thanks to their ancestors preferring to drink from moving streams over puddles in the wild.\n\nThere are some health benefits to buying a cat water fountain though, outside of letting your cat feel like they\u2019re the lion of the house.\n\nFountains encourage more drinking\n\nDrinking from a water fountain can help prevent health issues, like cystitis, urinary crystals, kidney issues, and more\n\nFountain designs can lessen whisker fatigue\n\nThe first two go hand in hand. The more water your cat drinks, the less likely they are to develop urinary crystals or have kidney issues. Increasing water intake is often a key strategy your veterinarian will implement if your pet is experiencing any of these issues. I know it firsthand, as Sirius developed crystals in 2023 due to previously having a diet that consisted of mainly dry food and he used to only have an old-school water bowl. After his surgery, we switched him to a water fountain and a wet food diet, and then the crystals pretty much vanished. He\u2019s now gone 13 months without issue.\n\nHis sister Luna has also reaped the benefits, not needing the water fountain like her brother, but she is still drinking water more now and making far less of a mess at her food and water station.\n\nWhy this cat water fountain?\n\nI have my theories on why my cats prefer the BUETEKA fountain over the original fountain I initially bought. They still use the other one, but I find them drinking from the BUETEKA fountain significantly more.\n\nThere is a little more space between the water dish and the spout on the BUETEKA fountain. I\u2019d assume that this allows them more space to catch the moving water before it hits the bowl. This is also a circle design, instead of an oval, so again, there is a little more space for them to stick their head over the bowl to get to the fountain\u2019s spout.\n\nThe BUETEKA water fountain also has a light blue light that is easy for cats to see, even in the dark. But it is not so bright that it will keep a human awake at night. Whereas the other fountain they have does not have a light for them to find the fountain at night.\n\nThe #1 feature about this water fountain that makes it infinitely better than the other fountain we own is that I never have to unplug it from the wall to clean it. The power cord connects in the middle, not the end that plugs into the wall, which makes this very easy to unplug without having to crawl around to get to the wall plug. This makes cleaning the water fountain substantially easier. It comes apart in seconds and I can wash each part in under a minute. I can either let it air dry or I can wipe it down and replace the water all in under five minutes.\n\nIt is simple to use, easy to clean, and only $50, which really is not that expensive for a product that my cats love and use every single day.\n\nGet the Bueteka Spaceship Ultra-Quiet Dog & Cat Water Fountain from Chewy for $50."

            "article_content": "An upcoming documentary about the UFO/UAP phenomenon promises to be the most well-sourced and credible film every made about the buzzy topic and its first trailer has just been released (below).\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure, by filmmaker Dan Farah, features on-record interviews with 34 current and former senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community with direct knowledge of unidentified aerial phenomena. The film contends there has been an 80-year cover-up of the existence of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse engineer UFO technology. As announced earlier Wednesday, The Age of the Disclosure has earned first-time director Farah a coveted premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival, where it will screen at the historic Paramount Theatre in March.\n\nSome of the officials interviewed include newly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio (who says in the trailer that, when it comes to this subject, \u201ceven presidents are operating on a need-to-know basis\u201d), New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds and General Jim Clapper (who was a U.S. director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama).\n\nFrom the official description: \u201cThe film was granted unprecedented access and support from senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community. Everyone interviewed in the film has direct knowledge of UAP as a result of their work for the U.S. Government. The film exposes the profound impact the situation has on the future of humanity, while providing a look behind the scenes with those at the forefront of the bipartisan disclosure effort.\u201d\n\nJim Semivan, who spent 25 years as a senior official with the CIA, says in the trailer: \u201cUAPs are here, they are real and they are not human.\u201d Adds Jay Stratton, former director of the U.S. government\u2019s UAP task force: \u201cThe first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come. This is similar to The Manhattan Project; this is the atomic weapon on steroids.\u201d\n\nFormer Department of Defense official and longtime UAP disclosure advocate Christopher Mellon declares, \u201cThis is the biggest discovery in human history,\u201d while former Department of Defense official and member of the government\u2019s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program Luis Elizondo says, \u201cYou have information being locked away that can change the trajectory of [our] species.\u201d\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure was made in secret over the past two years and filmmakers are currently in talks for commercial distribution plans; Cinetic is handling domestic sales.\n\nThe film follows a surge of public interest in the subject and two bipartisan congressional hearings over the past year where former officials and whistleblowers gave testimony claiming non-human intelligent life has visited Earth and that the U.S. has been engaged in a decades-long cover-up in an effort to reverse-engineer alien technology.\n\nFarah\u2019s producing credits include Ready Player One, which likewise scored a SXSW Film Festival premiere at the Paramount in 2018. The Age of Disclosure is a Farah Films production, in association with Born Ready Films. Produced and directed by Farah, executive producers are Colin Frederick, Andrew Farah and Shara Senderoff."

LAPRESSE\n\nIn a series of perplexing events, multiple UFO sightings have been reported and recorded over several days across California, particularly in the Fresno area. These sightings have sparked a wave of curiosity and concern, as both residents and authorities are left pondering the origins of these unidentified flying objects.\n\nThe string of sightings began with a mysterious light hovering over downtown Fresno in the early hours, just past 4 a.m. Local news station Fox 26 captured the first sighting on camera, showing a light that appeared to move swiftly before coming to a stationary hover. Earl Grey Anderson, a field investigator for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), reviewed the footage and classified it as an unidentified flying object.\n\nTaylor Swift's Heartfelt Message to Swifties\n\nThe following day, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara documented another UFO sighting, this time in the daylight. The footage added to the mounting intrigue surrounding these mysterious occurrences. A few days later, a private pilot reported seeing a white object trailing his aircraft at an altitude of 3,500 feet over downtown Fresno. Despite radioing the local airport tower for assistance, the pilot lost sight of the object shortly after.\n\nStill concern over what happened\n\nSeveral Fresno residents have also come forward with similar reports, describing their encounters with the unidentified objects. The recent sightings have reignited public fascination with UFOs, particularly as the Pentagon continues to release declassified information about aerial phenomena.\n\nWhile some speculate about extraterrestrial origins, others consider the possibility of advanced human-made technology or natural phenomena. Authorities are urging residents to remain calm as investigations continue.\n\nDespite the ongoing mystery, the sightings have undoubtedly captured the imaginations of those who witness these unexplained objects in the California skies. As the story develops, residents and authorities alike remain vigilant, hoping to uncover the truth behind these enigmatic appearances."

            "article_content": "All sorts of ghosts from the altruistic to the diabolic haunt movies, but it takes a while to get a bead on the entity drifting, and at times racing, through Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cPresence.\u201d However benign or malicious \u2014 whatever its life or death, possible eternal salvation or never-ending damnation \u2014 this spirit seizes your attention from the get-go because everything in this twisty, technically virtuosic, surprisingly moving chiller is shot from its point of view. From the moment the movie opens, you see what it sees: the good, the banal, the private, the scary. The kicker? Soderbergh is holding the camera \u2014 he\u2019s the ghost in this machine.\n\nIt\u2019s a typically well-oiled, polished, frictionless Soderbergh whatsit. Like many ghost stories, it takes place in one of the most historically troubled of all movie locations: an outwardly normal family home. There, in an attractive two-story suburban house with plenty of natural light, a wraparound front porch and a spacious backyard, the spirit wanders the handsome, blandly tasteful rooms and looks out the many windows. Although apparently confined to the house\u2019s interior, it never feels trapped. Even so, given all the mileage that it racks up as it moves from the downstairs kitchen to the upstairs bedrooms, it is demonstratively restless.\n\nThe ghost seems pretty benign despite the unease it stirs up. It\u2019s attentive and obviously interested in the family of four that moves in soon after \u201cPresence\u201d opens. If anything, the ghost seems eager for company. It routinely follows the family around, particularly the daughter, Chloe (Callina Liang, lovely), like a faithful dog \u2014 that is if that pooch were invisible and human size. (The height of the ghost\u2019s point of view is a tell.) It\u2019s curious yet also seems reserved. It likes to hang out in Chloe\u2019s closet and when she takes a shower, it stays outside the bathroom and tidies up, which suggests that it\u2019s not \u2014 or, rather, wasn\u2019t \u2014 a creep.\n\nThe screenwriter David Koepp seeds the story with such clues, giving you just enough back story and present-day information to stir your curiosity and keep you guessing as he and Soderbergh ratchet up your anxiety. A genre savant with a raft of big credits (\u201cJurassic Park\u201d), Koepp has an affinity for stories set in confined locations, especially those outwardly safe spaces that become mousetraps: He wrote David Fincher\u2019s \u201cPanic Room,\u201d a thriller set almost entirely inside a brownstone, as well as Soderbergh\u2019s thriller, \u201cKIMI,\u201d about an agoraphobic woman swept up in an intrigue. \u201cPresence\u201d is another ideal trap to trip for a filmmaker who enjoys challenges and changing it up artistically as much as Soderbergh does."

He worries about his teen kids, a competitive swimmer named Tyler (Eddy Maday) and a despondent, socially cloistered student named Chloe (Callina Liang).\n\nTwo of Chloe\u2019s friends recently died, suspected victims of drug overdoses, or possibly suicide.\n\nA despondent, socially cloistered student named Chloe (Callina Liang) is spied upon by an invisible entity in the closet in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s scareless ghost movie \u201cPresence.\u201d Courtesy of Neon\n\nChris pushes Chloe to be more outgoing and get on with life. Rebekah dismisses him and says time will be the best medicine, setting up a cold war of not-so-passive resistance between the two.\n\nMeanwhile, Tyler refuses to cut Sis any slack, accusing her of acting weird and being embarrassing. He does, however, introduce her to his friend, Ryan (West Mulholland), a confident kid with a mop of hair and a seductive approach that seems perfect for the insecure Chloe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about you,\u201d he coos. \u201cYou are in control.\u201d\n\nRemember, we witness all of this domestic drama as the entity, constantly roaming through the house, ducking into closets and corners undetected. Except when Chloe senses its presence and believes it might be one of her deceased friends.\n\nShe nearly freaks when she discovers that something has moved her books around and tidied up her room while she took a shower.\n\nWhen we, the entity, trash a closet and knock things off the furniture, Chris and Rebekah reluctantly allow a woman with Second Sight, Lisa (Natalie Woolams-Torres), into the house to communicate with us, the entity.\n\nA strong-willed wife and mother (Lucy Liu) senses she is being watched (and she is!) in \u201cPresence.\u201d Courtesy of Neon\n\n\u201cIt is confused,\u201d Lisa says. She reports that the spirit feels a need to accomplish something but doesn\u2019t know what.\n\nSoderbergh \u2014 director/cinematographer/editor using two pseudonyms \u2014 takes a bold gamble to create an appealing supernatural tale that doesn\u2019t qualify as horror and barely squeezes its thriller credentials in under the wire.\n\nHe uses strong actors, with superlative performances by Sullivan, Liu and especially a transcendent Liang, in a story that, like \u201cHeretic,\u201d proves the existence of God and the afterlife in the final shot.\n\nStill, \u201cPresence\u201d does not fully work for me.\n\nSo many inconsistent details kept me from buying into the story\u2019s internal logic.\n\nWhy do we, the entity, spend so much time apparently walking backward? To keep characters coming toward the camera perfectly in frame?\n\nWhy do we, the entity, race up staircases to observe something on the second floor in some scenes (consistent with the point-of-view), but in other scenes, Soderbergh simply cuts to the second floor?\n\nWhen we, the entity, destroy a closet and wreck a bedroom, why do we, the audience, see it as if we\u2019re standing on the other side of the room?\n\nWhy does the movie demonstrate that we, the entity, possess the ability to violently move and destroy objects, but when a character\u2019s life becomes threatened, we, the entity, inexplicably become powerless to interfere?\n\nHey, it\u2019s a ghost movie.\n\nAnd one that might make Chekhov turn over in his grave.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nStarring: Lucy Liu, Chris Sullivan, Callina Liang, Eddy Maday, West Mulholland\n\nDirected by: Steven Soderbergh\n\nOther: A Neon theatrical release.

            "article_content": "Credit: Rainer Fuhrmann/Shutterstock\n\nAccording to a 2022 poll from YouGov, 39% of Americans believe they have some form of paranormal ability. About a quarter of that group think they can sense other people's auras or emotion; 15% say they can hear voices or sounds from ghosts; and about 13% think they can see events from the past or future.\n\nThis is a public service announcement to the nearly 13 million Americans who believe they have supernatural powers: You are leaving a lot of money on the table. Various groups of skeptics worldwide have put a total of $1,408,424 (and one goat) on the table, and all that filthy lucre is just waiting to be collected by anyone who can manifest paranormal power.\n\nThe specific kinds of powers you need to demonstrate to win the prizes run the gamut. Dutch organization Stichting Skepsis will shell out 12 grand to practitioners of some forms of alternative medicine who can demonstrate its effectiveness (so if you're into applied kinesiology, give 'em a shot), and you can get a free goat from Fayetteville Freethinkers for proving a \"fulfilled Biblical prophecy.\" But whether you're able to see the future, move objects with your mind, or talk to spirits, there's a prize out there for you.\n\nThe history of paranormal prizes\n\nThe first monetary prize for proof of paranormal activity was offered by Scientific American in 1922. In the midst of the spiritualism movement, the publication offered $2,500 for anyone who could produce a \"spirit photograph\" (a photo that captures an image of a ghost) under controlled conditions, and $2,500 for anyone able to produce a \"visible psychic manifestation.\"\n\nFamous (at the time) medium George Valiantine gave it a shot and was able to create the illusion of a trumpet floating in the air in a dark room, but the test committee (which included Harry Houdini) had connected his chair to a light in an adjoining room, which lit up whenever Valiantine left his chair, which was also every time the trumpet appeared. Valiantine was proven a fraud, and Scientific American kept their cash.\n\nThe most famous bounty for psychic ability is the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi, a magician turned professional skeptic, first offered a prize of $1,000 back in 1964, but the cash grew to a million by 1996. Between 1964 and 2015 when the prize was discontinued, over 1,000 people applied, but none were successful at demonstrating their supernatural power under controlled conditions. No remote viewers were able to remote view. No dowsers were able to find hidden objects. No mind reader was able to read minds.\n\nHow paranormal prizes can backfire\n\nYou'd think that a 100% failure rate might make people question the reality of psychic abilities, but for a lot of people, public failure can make psychic abilities seem more plausible. At least that's how it worked for Uri Geller. Geller, who's still around and still claiming supernatural power, began gaining attention in the early 1970s for his supposed ability to bend spoons with his mind.\n\nWhile he never tried for James Randi's prize, the two had a famous run-in on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show that demonstrated the problems with disproving paranormal activity. Carson, who had been magician, was skeptical of Geller's claims, and brought him on his show and presented him with some tests that Randi helped develop.\n\nIf you want to see some uncomfortable TV, check it out:\n\nIf you don't have the 20 minutes to spare, Carson lets Geller take his time and try any of a series of test of his ability, but Geller can't. With Carson watching carefully and not allowing Geller control of any of the props, Geller can't bend a spoon with his mind; he can't determine whether a container holds water. He can't do anything.\n\nYou'd think a public failure this complete would have ended Geller's career, but it had the opposite effect. Geller blamed his failure on \"not feeling strongly\" and claimed he might have been \"blocking himself\" that night. Many apparently saw Geller's failure as proof that he was the real thing; after all, if he was a magician, the tricks would have worked. Geller then became a popular guest on other talk shows where he was able to perform his tricks successfully under less controlled conditions, and a star was born.\n\nWhy disproving anything is difficult\n\nWhile Uri Geller and other high-profile psychics are performers and are no doubt aware of how they're achieving their results, the 13 million or so Americans who believe they possess special powers aren't being deceitful\u2014it's just easy to believe in the supernatural. When something unusual happens, when a one-in-a-million occurrence occurs, it's easy to see that as proof of a mysterious, unexplainable something. If you're thinking about a friend and they text you that very minute, how can you not see that as evidence of some weird connection? But one-in-a-million events happen to over 300 people in America every single day, and there's no James Randi or Johnny Carson around to provide a controlled experiment to prove it's just a coincidence, to explain that you probably think of people all the time who don't text you that minute.\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong. If I am, there's over a million dollars and a goat out there waiting for the right person to come along and claim them."

            "article_content": "Free Newsletter Get the hottest Fintech Singapore News once a month in your Inbox\n\nThe Asian banking sector in 2025 is set to roar as it stands at the forefront of a global transformation in financial services.\n\nWith annual revenues from corporate and investment banking (CIB) exceeding USD $1.4 trillion, the region commands nearly half of the world\u2019s CIB revenues. Currently, it is also projected to sustain 7% annual growth through 2027. According to Fitch Ratings, Asia\u2019s banking landscape has been reaping the benefits from the stabilising interest rates and positive economic momentum, with pockets of opportunity emerging across diverse markets.\n\nTransaction banking, which includes cash management and trade finance, has also been pivotal in driving growth and deepening client relationships across Asia. Additionally, private credit\u2019s rise in Asia\u2019s financial markets offers an exciting avenue for innovation and competitive positioning.\n\nFollowing a recent webinar on Cracking the Code of Asia\u2019s Banking Trends in 2025 and Beyond, we\u2019ve invited some notable players in the financial landscape to walk us through the latest up-and-coming trends within the banking sector in this region.\n\nThe Asian financial landscape is being revolutionised at lightning speed by innovation. However, amidst this whirlwind, distinguishing actionable trends from the noise is becoming more and more challenging.\n\nEmphasis on Profitability and Growth\n\nTo begin the 2025 list of top banking trends in Asia, we first must take a look at what drives banks the most\u2014profits and growth.\n\nThe journey towards profitability and sustained growth has always become a central theme for digital banks, not just in Asia but also across the globe. Jessica Lam, Group Chief Strategy Officer at WeLab, highlighted that, after years of financial discipline during challenging market conditions (especially during the COVID-19 era), banks are now positioned to focus on scaling their operations.\n\nShe noted that stabilised markets have created an environment ripe for expansion. This is where institutions can confidently invest in new technologies and enter untapped markets.\n\nJessica remarked, \u201cNow that many of us have proven the proof of concept works, the next step is scaling up responsibly.\u201d\n\nThis transition signifies a shift from merely surviving economic turbulence to thriving by leveraging improved financial frameworks and consumer trust. Furthermore, many banks are now exploring strategic partnerships and collaborations, particularly in Southeast Asia, to accelerate growth and streamline operations.\n\nHyper-Personalisation Through AI\n\nAs seen in the top 5 trends shaping the fintech scene in Singapore, AI has been the talk of the town for the banking sector since it first shared its limelight back in 2020. This came as no surprise, as Artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to create highly personalised banking experiences\n\nAlbert Tinio, Co-CEO of GoTyme Bank Philippines, emphasised that AI\u2019s potential lies in its ability to understand individual customer behaviours and preferences at an unprecedented scale. This enables banks to offer bespoke financial solutions tailored to the specific needs of each customer. By doing so, they enhance satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nAlbert elaborated, \u201cWe\u2019re now able to create hyper-connected ecosystems where data shared securely can benefit the end customer.\u201d\n\nSuch hyper-connectivity is not limited to financial services. It also extends across industries, enabling seamless integration of financial tools into everyday activities.\n\nMeanwhile, Taruni Ramamurthi, Head of FSI Malaysia and Philippines at Amazon Web Services, underscored the ethical considerations of AI deployment.\n\nShe stated that AI should be a tool to enhance human-centric banking, ensuring customer trust remains intact. With AI being widely adopted for fraud detection, compliance, and customer engagement, banks are focusing on ensuring transparency and accountability.\n\nThese efforts aim to build and maintain consumer confidence. Generative AI applications are also gaining traction, allowing banks to automate complex processes such as risk analysis and predictive modelling. This, in turn, improves efficiency significantly.\n\nOpen Banking and Collaboration\n\nOpen banking is also gradually becoming a reality across Asia, albeit at varying levels of adoption. Albert highlighted the slow but steady progress in the Philippines. Regulators are working to ensure that consumer consent and data security are prioritised.\n\n\u201cFor open banking to succeed, all institutions need to embrace collaboration and share data responsibly,\u201d Albert stated.\n\nThis collaborative model allows customers to access a consolidated view of their financial information, enabling them to make more informed decisions. Open banking also fosters innovation, as fintechs and third-party providers can develop new products and services through secure API integrations.\n\nJessica echoed these sentiments, adding that the true potential of open banking lies in its ability to create a more inclusive financial ecosystem. Open banking could drive significant advancements in financial inclusion across underserved markets. All of this can be made possible by lowering barriers to entry for new players and promoting interoperability.\n\nBranches Reinvented\n\nThe debate surrounding the relevance of physical branches in the digital era continues. However, their role is undoubtedly evolving. Taruni described branches as becoming \u201cexperience centres\u201d designed to address specific customer needs, such as financial education and community engagement.\n\nIn regions like Southeast Asia, where access to the internet remains uneven, branches serve as critical touchpoints for unbanked populations.\n\nJessica also weighed in on the transformation of branches, stating, \u201cThe purpose of branches should evolve to complement digital offerings, creating seamless customer experiences.\u201d\n\nShe suggested that future branches could blend digital tools with personalised human interactions to bridge the gap between traditional and digital banking. For instance, branches could host financial literacy workshops or offer specialised advisory services for small businesses. This approach fosters deeper customer relationships.\n\nAdding to this global shift, some Hong Kong digital banks are rethinking their strategies and considering physical branches following the HKMA\u2019s recent rule change, as reported by the South China Morning Post (SCMP). This change, aimed at supporting growth, allows for limited physical branches and has prompted digital banks like WeLab Bank, ZA Bank, and Mox Bank to explore offline strategies.\n\nWhile Livi Bank remains fully digital, other players see this as an opportunity to enhance trust and customer experience through face-to-face interactions and advisory services. Traditional banks in Hong Kong are also adapting by focusing on prime locations to attract wealth-management clients or integrating hybrid models, blending sustainability and digital-forward designs.\n\nSuch evolution highlights how branches are increasingly becoming versatile touchpoints that cater to both digital natives and those who value in-person banking experiences.\n\nIn addition, Frankie Wai, Business Solution Director at Temenos, mentioned that technology can further enhance the utility of branches. Features like biometric authentication and AI-powered kiosks could make in-branch services more efficient and appealing to tech-savvy customers while still catering to those who prefer face-to-face interactions.\n\nRegulatory and Ethical Challenges\n\nAs the banking sector embraces technological advancements, the importance of ethical considerations and regulatory compliance is becoming increasingly apparent. Frankie stressed that transparency and accountability must underpin the adoption of AI and open banking.\n\n\u201cRegulators are increasingly focusing on ensuring that technological advancements are used responsibly to safeguard consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nOne key area of concern is data privacy. With the rise of open banking and AI-driven insights, banks are handling vast amounts of sensitive customer information. This requires robust security measures and clear guidelines to prevent misuse.\n\nFurthermore, regulators across Asia are introducing frameworks to govern the ethical use of AI. These frameworks aim to ensure that algorithms do not perpetuate bias or discrimination.\n\nPayment Innovation and Cross-Border Collaboration\n\nThe payments sector is undergoing significant transformation, with cross-border interoperability emerging as a major focus area. Frankie also highlighted Asia\u2019s adoption of global payment standards like ISO 20022. These standards enable seamless and transparent regional transactions.\n\nHe believes that collaboration across borders will redefine how SMEs and individuals engage in international commerce.\n\nProjects such as Nexus, which aim to link payment systems across countries, are poised to create a unified regional payment ecosystem. These advancements not only facilitate trade but also empower micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to expand their reach.\n\nTaruni added that such innovations could be instrumental in driving financial inclusion, particularly for women entrepreneurs and underserved communities.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of AI in payment systems is streamlining operations, enhancing fraud detection, and improving user experiences. From biometric authentication to real-time transaction monitoring, these advancements are setting new benchmarks for efficiency and security in the payments landscape.\n\nThe Asian Edge\n\nThe trends show that the banking sector in Asia in 2025 reflects a unique confluence of rapid growth, innovation, and challenges that set it apart from other regions. The region\u2019s CIB market is growing faster than any other globally, with SMEs and green infrastructure investments acting as pivotal drivers.\n\nHowever, these opportunities exist alongside persistent risks such as volatile real estate markets in China and regulatory uncertainties. Comparatively, while Western economies focus on streamlining mature banking systems, Asia\u2019s landscape requires a nuanced approach to cater to diverse markets and evolving customer expectations.\n\nThe ability to balance technological advancement with ethical practices will be critical. Asia\u2019s banking leaders are well-positioned to redefine the global narrative, focusing on financial inclusion, sustainability, and innovation.\n\nInstitutions that adopt agile strategies and invest in cutting-edge technologies are likely to outpace their competitors, shaping the region\u2019s banking landscape for decades to come. In this pivotal era, Asia is not merely adapting to global banking trends but rather defining them.\n\nThe top banking trends in Asia showcase how the region is leveraging innovation to transform its financial landscape. With advancements in AI, open banking, and cross-border payments, Asia is setting benchmarks for global banking practices.\n\nCatch up on the Cracking the Code of Asia\u2019s Banking Trends in 2025 and Beyond webinar to dive deeper into the trends that are redefining the financial landscape in Asia.\n\nFeatured image credit: Edited from Freepik"

The clip, released to promote his memoir Source Code, delves into Gates' fourth-grade experience of bringing a cow lung to school for a show-and-tell activity.\n\nRecalling the incident, Gates shared how his teacher had asked the students to bring something \"interesting\" for show-and-tell. After discussing it with his father, Gates took up an unusual suggestion. \"My dad said, \u2018We could go to the slaughterhouse and get a cow lung,\u2019 and I thought that was a great idea,\" Gates revealed.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe young Gates accompanied his father to the slaughterhouse, picked up the organ, and wrapped it in a white sheet to take to school. Upon unveiling the cow lung in his classroom, his classmates reacted with a mix of fascination and revulsion. Gates performed experiments on the organ, using it to demonstrate how lungs work. \"When I unwrapped it, it was a mixture of awe and disgust. Yeah, I actually didn\u2019t use gloves,\" he admitted in the video.\n\nGates recreated the experiment in the video, this time donning gloves as he handled the organ. He humorously recounted how one of his classmates fainted during his original demonstration. Reflecting on his teacher\u2019s reaction, he recalled her saying, \u201cHey, that was great, but get that thing out of here.\u201d Gates described the experiment as a \u201cbig hit\u201d among his peers at the time.\n\nThe video served as a promotional piece for Source Code, Gates\u2019 first memoir, which he says shares stories from his childhood and the early days of Microsoft. In the memoir, Gates reflects on the experiences, lessons, and relationships that shaped his life and career.\n\n\n\nAccording to GatesNotes, his personal blog, Source Code details the foundation of his life, exploring key moments that defined his journey from a curious child to a global tech icon. The memoir also highlights his vision and the choices that steered his professional and personal development.\n\nGates, who co-founded Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975 after dropping out of Harvard, has become one of the most influential figures in technology and philanthropy. He stepped down from Microsoft\u2019s board in 2020 and has since focused on global challenges such as climate change, health crises, and technology-driven solutions.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nAt the time of stepping down, Gates owned around 1.3% of Microsoft\u2019s shares. By 2022, his philanthropic efforts had led him to donate billions in Microsoft shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reducing his ownership to less than 1%.\n\nOver the years, Gates has authored several books addressing critical global issues, including pandemics, climate change, and technological advancements. However, Source Code marks his first foray into a deeply personal account, providing a glimpse into the man behind the achievements.\n\n\"When my teacher said 'bring something interesting' for show-and-tell, I don\u2019t think she expected a cow lung,\" Gates wrote in the caption of the video. \"It\u2019s just one of many stories from my childhood that I share in my new memoir, Source Code.\""

            "article_content": "Coworking has surged in popularity over the last two decades, but with the rise of hybrid work models and return-to-office mandates, its future is uncertain.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, tech worker hubs crop up in disparate neighborhoods, setting up a need for more community where coworking can step in. As grand openings and major closures of these spaces coincide in the region, coworking founders in the area say that shift could be the difference between staying in business and having to close up shop.\n\n\u201cWe, community organizers, cannot maintain spaces within a purely transactional relationship,\u201d Colin Dean, managing director of a group for software professionals that previously ran a coworking space Code & Supply, told Technical.ly.\n\nPittsburgh has strong comeback potential, and a storied history, to make that happen. The city was recently ranked No. 9 in the US for coworking density, offering residents 0.8 coworking spaces per square mile, according to a study from CoworkingCafe.\n\nThe popularity of coworking in Pittsburgh started growing in the late 2010s, according to Dale McNutt, owner of 5thAVE Studio, a coworking space in Pittsburgh\u2019s Uptown.\n\nIn 5thAVE Studio\u2019s early days, the space was primarily occupied by startups aimed at spurring community redevelopment in the area. Its residents have included Pittsburgh\u2019s first makerspace, HackPGH, standout startups like NoWait \u2013 which developed a restaurant waitlist app that was acquired by Yelp for $40 million in 2017 \u2013 nonprofits such as the newsroom PublicSource, as well as fashion brands, interior design firms, artists and even a hair salon.\n\nToday, nearly 90 companies have passed through the 13,000-square-foot space, and across industries, there\u2019s a common thread. Coworking residents like to be surrounded by art, books and creative material, while also having control over a space they individually own, according to McNutt.\n\n\u201cThere was a vision that a lot of coworking spaces had that you would come into a space and just sit at a table,\u201d McNutt said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people want that anymore. I think they want to feel like they have more of a space of their own.\u201d\n\nYet, coworking spaces still shutter when they can\u2019t find the financial support to back that up.\n\nC&S Workspace before it closed in December 2024 (Courtesy of Code & Supply Company)\n\nIts finances, not a lack of interest, driving coworking spaces away\n\nWhile Code & Supply\u2019s coworking space, C&S Workspace on Friendship Avenue, bounced back after Covid, a wave of tech layoffs starting in 2022 caused its trajectory to change course. Late last year, Dean announced it would be closed by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cOur members were impacted hard,\u201d Dean said. \u201cWe dropped to around 50% capacity by May 2023 and never bounced back, despite more active marketing to our base and incentives for past members to return.\u201d\n\nFrom Dean\u2019s perspective, the C&S coworking space was susceptible to macroeconomic trends, like the rise of inflation and interest rates, that caused employment contraction. Microeconomic factors, like people needing coworking space less because of underemployment or investing in home offices, hurt the business.\n\nHowever, the community kept C&S going through it all, as 40% of the members kept paying even when the space was closed during the pandemic, according to Dean. The return on that investment was \u201cnot money but community,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHumans need a third space,\u201d Dean said. \u201cCoworking spaces, like the guild halls that preceded them, can fill that need when limited funds are available becomes an exercise in continuous novelty and marketing, both of which are real work.\u201d\n\nWith those lessons in mind, other coworking developers are trying to find a way forward, hoping for opportunities in not just selling a workspace, but in offering a service that fosters social connections and encourages networking, collaboration and even the potential for new friendships.\n\nMembers of the South Hills coworking team and nearby residents participate in a co-design event on Jan. 22 at Carnegie Coffee Company (Alice Crow/Technical.ly)\n\nFounders hope community input can revive the spaces\n\nA community-first approach is exactly what three aspiring coworking space founders aim to implement as they look to open a new location in the South Hills.\n\nChris Roberts, Karlyn Gold and Matt Nicosia all connected over their desire to be around and work near like-minded people. All residents of Pittsburgh\u2019s southern suburbs, the team said there aren\u2019t great options for coworking in the area and driving into the city is often a necessity to find a decent place.\n\nWhile there are corporate-owned coworking spaces nearby, Roberts said he and his cofounder were looking for a place with \u201csome life to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go into any of those spaces and most people don\u2019t know each other,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThere\u2019s very little interaction and very little thought put into facilitating interaction in those environments.\u201d\n\nDespite possible headwinds with entering into this industry, the team plans to apply a community-based approach to the process of opening a space, taking inspiration from Philadelphia\u2019s Indy Hall.\n\n\u201cThey started with community first,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cSo, let\u2019s focus on building a group of people who are interested in the same things, and then we can work together to make this thing happen.\u201d\n\nOne of the benefits of a community-first model is it offers lots of opportunities for input, on everything from workspace design to the business\u2019s financial structure. In that vein, the South Hills coworking team held a community engagement event in January to gather local resident input on a possible coworking space on Carnegie\u2019s historic Main Street.\n\nThe group discussed what makes a coworking space great, what coworking spaces are getting wrong and potential building features and amenities the future space could have.\n\nJust like the ethos behind long-running spaces like C&S and 5thAVE Studio, the event participants generally agreed a coworking space isn\u2019t just a place to get work done, it\u2019s a place to connect.\n\n\u201cWe want to be around people, but we want to find ways where it isn\u2019t forced,\u201d Mike McGreevy, an attendee and independent consultant, said. \u201cThe DNA of this business is community and not just being an office space. Now, more than ever with the freedom to not be in the office everyday, we need something to fill that gap.\u201d\n\nMembers of the South Hills coworking team and nearby residents review possible design options for a coworking space at a co-design event on Jan. 22 at Carnegie Coffee Company (Alice Crow/Technical.ly)\n\nStill, the South Hills founders face the same challenge presented to past coworking spaces: the financials. They\u2019re conducting market and qualitative research by interviewing around 40 people to find out what to charge.\n\nThe recent event jumpstarted that, aiming to get community feedback on possible strategies with the hope that engaging the community is ultimately what gives it more longevity.\n\n\u201cCoworking can die,\u201d Mark Heckmann, an attendee at the event, said, \u201ceven when you do everything right.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Humans' outer ears may have evolved from the gills of prehistoric fish, a new study finds.\n\nGene-editing experiments indicate that cartilage in fish gills migrated into the ear canal millions of years ago during the course of our evolution . Going even further back, our outer ears may have evolutionary roots in ancient marine invertebrates, such as horseshoe crabs , scientists say.\n\nThe research sheds new light on the mysterious origins of outer ears, which are unique to mammals. \"When we started the project, the evolutionary origin of the outer ear was a complete black box,\" study co-author Gage Crump , a professor of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at the University of Southern California, said in a statement .\n\nResearchers already knew that our middle ears \u2014 each of which sits behind the eardrum and comprises three small bones \u2014 arose from the jawbones of ancient fish. This example of evolution transforming and repurposing anatomical structures \"made us wonder whether the cartilaginous outer ear may also have arisen from some ancestral fish structure,\" Crump said.\n\nRelated: I'm an evolutionary biologist who investigates real-time evolution in bacteria. These are my 5 must-read science books.\n\nOur outer ears and those of other mammals are made of a subtype of cartilage called elastic cartilage. It is more flexible than either hyaline cartilage or fibrocartilage, which are present in the human nose and in the disks between our vertebrae, respectively.\n\nThe key to tracing the origins of humans' outer ears to fish was the discovery that elastic cartilage is also present in fish gills. \"When we started the study, there was very little out there about whether elastic cartilage existed outside of mammals,\" Crump said.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe researchers used protein stains to reveal that the gills of zebrafish (Danio rerio), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and three other species of fish contain elastic cartilage. The species are all modern bony fishes, suggesting that elastic cartilage is a general feature in this group, according to the study, which was published Jan. 9 in the journal Nature .\n\nNext, the scientists tested the evolutionary link between elastic cartilage in fish gills and mammalian outer ears. Elastic cartilage doesn't preserve well in fossils, so the researchers used molecular clues instead. They looked for gene control elements called \"enhancers\" \u2014 short DNA sequences that can activate associated genes when bound by specific proteins.\n\nA gene control element for human outer ear development shows activity in the gills (green) of a zebrafish. (Image credit: Mathi Thiruppathy/Crump Lab/USC Stem Cell)\n\nBecause genetic enhancers are highly tissue-specific, researchers can easily detect where the enhancers are active. To test whether enhancer activity \u2014 and therefore gene regulation \u2014 is similar in fish gills and human outer ears, Crump and his colleagues inserted human outer ear enhancers into zebrafish genomes.\n\nThe experiment triggered activity in the gills of zebrafish, hinting at an ancestral link between the genes in human outer ears and fish gills. Then, the researchers conducted the experiment in reverse: They inserted enhancers associated with zebrafish gills into mouse genomes and detected activity in the mice's outer ears.\n\nThrough another series of experiments with tadpoles and green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis), the team showed that amphibians and reptiles also inherited their gill and ear structures from fish. In lizards, enhancer activity was in the ear canal, which suggests that elastic cartilage had begun migrating from the gills to the outer ear by the time reptiles appeared on Earth around 315 million years ago.\n\n\"Our findings suggest that elements of an ancestral gill developmental program were reutilized multiple times through the course of vertebrate evolution to generate diverse gill and ear structures,\" the researchers wrote in the study.\n\nFinally, the team found an enhancer in horseshoe crab cells that triggered activity in zebrafish gills. Horseshoe crabs are \"living fossils\" that emerged around 400 million years ago, and the discovery suggests our outer ears may have much deeper evolutionary roots than previously thought.\n\nAlthough more research is needed to confirm how deep these roots stretch, \"this work provides a new chapter to the evolution of the mammalian ear,\" Crump said."

            "article_content": "A growing chorus in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street believes enterprise software will join the AI party in 2025. Previously, the artificial intelligence boom had largely passed over the sector, but investors are becoming increasingly excited about the rise of so-called agentic AI. As a recent note from Bank of America explains, this doesn\u2019t refer to regular-old chatbots, but rather powerful models that can operate autonomous digital agents capable of enhanced reasoning and decision-making.\n\nBofA and others believe that can help unleash a sector that has lagged the broader market in recent times. The S&P North American Technology Software Index\u2014made up of companies like Oracle, Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Intuit, and Adobe\u2014is up just over 20% in the past 12 months, which, while not awful, trails the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 25% gain. However, U.S. software stocks rallied 12% in the final quarter of 2024, according to BofA, as the Street became more bullish about agentic AI as a disruptive force.\n\n\u201cOver the next decade, these fully autonomous agent and robot fleets may ultimately alter verticals heavily reliant on human capital and spark a corporate efficiency revolution that transforms the global economy,\u201d BofA analysts led by Alkesh Shah, head of the firm\u2019s Americas software research, wrote last week.\n\nThough the analysts acknowledged the sector is not exactly cheap, they point out that revenue multiples and growth expectations remain below five-year median and pre-COVID levels, suggesting this upside is not fully priced in. The year might get off to a rocky start, they said, as the market waits for more clarity on President Donald Trump\u2019s policies and potentially wrestles with higher-than-expected interest rates as well as weaker-than-forecast spending from small- and medium-size businesses.\n\nStill, BofA said more powerful digital agents could begin displacing workers in call centers and industries like software engineering and marketing as soon as the second half of the year. That could expand, they said, to biopharmaceuticals, human resources, nursing, education, cybersecurity, manufacturing, and law by 2026 or 2027.\n\nSalesforce and Palantir lead the way\n\nAt the forefront of this shift is Salesforce, with CEO Marc Benioff saying the household name is behaving like a startup and reworking much of the way it does business to ensure its products do not become obsolete. Case in point is the software giant\u2019s new AI offering, Agentforce, which allows users to quickly build and deploy digital assistants.\n\nThe company is charging $2 per use case, a shift from its traditional subscription-based pricing model. Salesforce closed 200 deals when the product debuted in the final week of Q3, Benioff told analysts on the company\u2019s December earnings call.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "DeepSeek, a Chinese Artificial Intelligence startup, has launched a new model that it claims is on par with OpenAI-o1.\n\nIn a recently released paper, the startup noted that its new flagship AI model, R1, showed a new level of reasoning. It tweeted, \u201cDeepSeek-R1 is here. Performance on par with OpenAI-o1. Fully open-source model and technical report. MIT licensed: distill and commercialise freely.\u201d\n\nAccording to experts, this product is a huge leap in terms of scale and efficiency and may upend expectations of how much power and computing will be needed to manage the AI revolution, considering it was done on a cheaper budget than AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nRead also: Investment in GenAI to rise by 60% in 3 years\n\n\u201cDeepSeek R1 is 100 percent open source and 96.4 percent cheaper than OpenAI o1 while delivering similar performance. OpenAI o1: $60.00 per 1M output tokens DeepSeek R1: $2.19 per 1M output tokens,\u201d tweeted Shubham Saboo, a senior AI product manager in the US.\n\nArnaud Bertrand, founder of HouseTrip and Me & Qi, noted on X, \u201cIt\u2019s essentially as if someone had released a mobile on par with the iPhone but was selling it for $30 instead of $1000.\u201d\n\nAccording to DeepSeek, R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. Its research paper states that this is possible because of pure reinforcement learning. According to Jim Fan, senior research manager at Nvidia, this technique is why Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaZero is a master at games like Go and Chess from scratch.\n\nDeepSeek, launched in 2023, explained in its paper that its goal is to explore the potential of AI to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data. It noted that an earlier version of R1, called R1-Zero, gave it an \u201caha moment\u201d in which the AI \u201clearned to allocate more thinking time to a problem to reevaluating its initial approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are living in a timeline where a non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive \u2013 truly open, frontier research that empowers all. It makes no sense. The most entertaining outcome is the most likely,\u201d tweeted Jim Fan.\n\nHe noted that DeepSeek\u2019s R1 is not only an open source but also spills all the training secrets of AI models. Bertrand of Me & Qi explained that the open source nature of R1 will enable plenty of AI applications that were unaffordable before.\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cSay, for instance, that you want to build a service that helps people summarize books (random example). In AI parlance, the average book is roughly 120,000 tokens (since a \u201ctoken\u201d is about 3/4 of a word and the average book is roughly 90,000 words).\n\nRead also: Artificial Intelligence (AI) \u2013What impact will it have on education?\n\n\u201cAt OpenAI\u2019s prices, processing a single book would cost almost $2 since they charge $15 per 1 million tokens. DeepSeek\u2019s API, however, would cost only $0.07, which means your service can process about 30 books for $2 vs just 1 book with OpenAI: suddenly your book summarizing service is economically viable.\u201d\n\nHe noted that DeepSeek has changed the AI game. OpenAI began the AI race when it launched ChatGPT in November 2022. However, models from tech giants such as Google and Meta and those from across the world are catching up.\n\nShare"

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump threatened on Wednesday to impose stiff taxes, tariffs and sanctions on Russia if an agreement isn\u2019t reached to end the war in Ukraine , a warning that is likely fall on deaf ears in the Kremlin. The United States already prohibits the import of virtually all Russian products, and Russia has faced a multitude of U.S. and European sanctions since the invasion began almost three years ago.\n\nIn a post to his Truth Social site on Wednesday, Trump urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to \u201csettle now and stop this ridiculous war.\u201d\n\nHe said he had no desire to hurt Russia \u2014 which he noted had played a major role in securing victory for the Allies against Nazi Germany in World War II \u2014 and has a good relationship with Putin, but warned of the penalties if the war isn\u2019t stopped soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t make a \u2018deal,\u2019 and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries.\u201d\n\nTrump has been skeptical of the billions of dollars the Biden administration provided Ukraine in weapons and other materiel to defend itself. He has often spoken of his desire to end the war and said on the campaign trail that he could end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office. That has not happened.\n\nThe problem with the threat is that other than a small amount of fertilizer, animal feed, inorganic material like tin, and machinery, Russia currently exports very little to the U.S. that could be subject to tariffs. Oil had been Russia\u2019s largest export to the U.S., but such trade was zeroed out in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. imported a total of $2.8 billion worth of these products from Russia in 2024, a tiny fraction of U.S. imports and a precipitous drop from 2023, when it was $4.5 billion, and 2022, when it was $14.4 billion, according to U.S. government statistics.\n\nAnd, Russia is already one of the world\u2019s most heavily sanctioned nations. Many of those sanctions relate to its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and were imposed under President Joe Biden, but others predate Biden. Some were imposed during Trump\u2019s first term in office, and some date back to Russia\u2019s 2014 seizure of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula."

The Nifty 50 was up 0.6% at close on Wednesday. Macrotech Developers dropped 6.1%, whereas Oberoi Realty , Sobha, Prestige Estates Projects and Godrej Properties were down over 5% on Wednesday.\"After Covid, the real estate sector had seen supernormal growth, and due to this high base and a recent normalisation in growth, the stocks have fallen,\" said George Thomas, fund manager-equity, Quantum AMC. \"The market had extrapolated the growth due to which most stocks had reached high valuations which are now coming off.\"In 2024, all Nifty Realty index stocks, barring Mahindra Lifespaces, jumped 14-65%. All stocks in the sector gained 17-154% in 2023. The benchmark realty index soared 81% and 34% in 2023 and 2024, respectively.\"The real estate sector has seen some profit booking after it outperformed the markets last year,\" said Sunny Agrawal, head of fundamental research at SBICaps Securities. \"Valuations have been steep across the board and with this correction, especially in midcaps and smallcaps, there is now some valuation comfort in this segment.\"Agrawal said investors could buy afresh based on the third quarter results and looking at regionwise trends in real-estate. He said that Sunteck Realty , which has posted strong results, is likely to see a recovery soon. Lodha is also attractive after the recent fall, said Agrawal. DLF and Prestige are also among his favoured picks.The worst of the recent sell-off may not be over yet. \u201cWe believe that there is some more room for correction in this sector before valuations turn attractive for investors again,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cInvestors may also keep a note of the launches, which have been neutral recently, as any new projects may trigger some upside in these stocks.\u201dThe Nifty Realty index has dropped 18% so far in 2025 as against 2.1% decline in the Nifty.Analysts prefer companies that cater to the premium segment for now as the economic slowdown could slow demand in the lower-income groups.\u201cPremiumisation in this sector was seen in the last few months as it was a segment not impacted by Covid, but it is not a perpetual trend and we may see companies providing middle-range and affordable housing doing well in the future,\u201d said Thomas.Thomas said inventory levels across key markets continue to be reasonable at less than 18 months of sales. He estimates the shares to do well once valuations are in line with the growth."

            "article_content": "Shares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) are up a fantastic 55% over the past year, strongly outperforming the S&P 500 index's 26% gain. The banking giant has successfully leveraged a resilient economic backdrop into a record year for profitability.\n\nThis momentum was evident in its latest fourth-quarter earnings report (for the period ended Dec. 31), which exceeded Wall Street expectations. The bank posted Q4 earnings per share (EPS) of $4.81, up 58% from last year.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nWith the stock trading near a record high, investors may be wondering if the rally has further room to run or if the opportunity has already passed. Let's discuss whether JPMorgan Chase stock is a buy now.\n\nJPMorgan's record year by the numbers\n\nThe allure of JPMorgan Chase as an investment starts with its dominant position as the largest U.S. bank, bolstered by a globally diversified financial services footprint. Its size and scale have proven to be a significant advantage during a period in which smaller institutions have struggled to rebuild market confidence following the 2023 industry turmoil that saw several regional banks collapse. In this case, JPMorgan has consolidated its market share by attracting deposits from a growing client base.\n\nThese dynamics have powered an impressive set of operating and financial results. Even with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates last year, pressuring the bank's net interest income, Q4 revenue rose 11% year over year.\n\nThe investment banking division stood out particularly well, with fees surging 49% from last year, reflecting an improved environment for deal-making, as well as larger mergers and acquisitions. The strong performance in global asset prices contributed to a 21% increase revenue from the markets and securities services group and also helped drive client assets under management up 18% compared to the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the consumer business continues to show strength through solid debit and credit card sales.\n\nPerhaps the most significant development has been the stable credit conditions. Compared to fears of widespread delinquencies in the loan portfolio in recent years, the Q4 provision for credit losses at $2.6 billion was down 15% sequentially from Q3 and 5% lower from the prior-year quarter. This trend has kept costs subdued and drove full-year EPS to $19.75 per share, up from $16.23 in 2023. Overall, JPMorgan has reaffirmed its position as a blue chip stock with industry-leading fundamentals.\n\nPerson accepting a cash transaction in paper currency with open hands.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat's next for JPMorgan in 2025?\n\nHow JPMorgan Chase performs in 2025 will largely depend on how economic conditions evolve. A backdrop of a firm labor market and durable credit conditions would support the bank's income growth. Investors comfortable with this baseline scenario have good reason to buy or hold the stock.\n\nOn the other hand, when considering any investment, it's important to examine it critically and think about what could go wrong. While projecting optimism in the outlook by citing the still-low unemployment rate and improving business optimism in the U.S. into the new year, comments by CEO Jamie Dimon also offered a word of caution. He specifically highlighted inflationary pressures and volatile geopolitical conditions as primary risks within the bank's range of possible scenarios.\n\nSimply put, if inflation accelerates while the economy slows, JPMorgan's results would likely suffer. Investors must weigh several uncertainties, including interest rate trajectories, fiscal policy under the new Trump administration, and the Federal Reserve's future moves that could impact the stock.\n\nBeyond these factors, JPMorgan's shares appear relatively expensive, trading at 2.2 times book value, well above the decade average of 1.5. Separately, the stock's dividend yield of about 1.9% has settled near its 10-year low. While this premium valuation doesn't necessarily signal the stock needs to be sold off, my interpretation is that it may limit the upside potential in the near term.\n\nJPM Price to Book Value Chart\n\nJPM Price to Book Value data by YCharts\n\nDecision time: I'm on the sidelines\n\nThere's a lot to like about JPMorgan Chase, which is well-positioned to reward shareholders over the long run. That said, I believe the stock is just a bit too pricey following the spectacular rally over the past year to jump in and buy with bullish conviction. Ultimately, investors may find more compelling stocks with better value elsewhere.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "article_content": "\u20b9\n\n\u20b9\n\nShares of Cables and Wires manufacturer Polycab India Ltd. opened with gains of up to 4% on Thursday, January 23, after multiple brokerages reiterated their positive outlook on the stock post its December quarter results.Despite Polycab's rough start to 2025, with the stock down 15% year-to-date, majority of the Street continues to remain bullish on the stock. Over 65% of the 32 analysts that have coverage on the company have a 'Buy' recommendation on the counter, while seven of them have a 'Hold' rating and four say 'Sell'.Consensus price targets on Polycab suggest a further upside of another 27.5% on the stock from Wednesday's closing levels. Among analysts, Jefferies currently has a price target of \u20b99,200 on Polycab, which is the highest on the Street, implying a potential upside of 50% from Wednesday's close.Brokerage firm Jefferies, which also has a 'Buy' rating on the stock, said that Polycab reported strong Q3 results with consolidated sales and EBITDA growing over 20% and 26% year-on-year, respectively.While cables demand was healthy in Q3, wires slackened due to softening of copper price and high channel inventory at start of Q3.Operating profit margins (OPM) rose to 13.8% (+70 basis points year-on-year, +230 basis points quarter-on-quarter), driven by margin normalisation in Cables & Wires (C&W) and reduced losses in the FMEG segment.Other non-operating income declined by 65% year-on-year, leading to lower profit growth of 11% year-on-year, broadly in line with Jefferies' estimates.The management has provided healthy guidance for next five years:- Capex to range between \u20b96,000 crore to \u20b98,000 crore- Wires and cables margin to be between 11% to 13%- FMEG EBITDA to be between 8% and 10%- Dividend payout to be over 30%- Exports to contribute more than 10% of the total businessUBS too has a 'Buy' rating on Polycab, with a price target of9,000 per share. The brokerage said that the cable and wire topline growth of 12% drove miss on topline. This was led by slowing government capex and should recover with rebound in government capex.FMEG segment saw sequential reduction in loss (PBIT margins at 3% as against 6.4% in Q2).Citi has maintained a 'Buy' rating on Polycab, with a price target of \u20b98,600, naming it their top pick.Revenue grew 20% on-year, slightly missing Citi's estimate by 2%, but EBITDA rose 26% on-year, surpassing estimates by 15%. The strong EBITDA performance was driven by better-than-expected margins in the Wires & Cables segment and reduced losses in the FMEG business.Wires & Cables margins improved 119bps QoQ (-56bps YoY) to 13.5%, supported by-- Margin normalisation in wires, and- Increased contributions from international business, which rose to 8.3% (compared to 6.2% in Q3FY24 and 6.1% in Q2FY25).- Management expects export momentum to continue into Q4FY25.Another brokerage house Macquarie has an 'Outperform' rating on Polycab, with a price target of7,928 per share.Their strategic outlook implies 15% revenue CAGR for FY25-30. Polycab reported Q3 revenue of \u20b95,200 crore (+20% YoY) and EBITDA of \u20b9720 crore (+26% YoY), both in line with estimates.Key positive surprise, as per the brokerage, was better than expected C&W segment margins, which expanded 120bps QoQ (down 50bps YoY) to 13.5%, driven by better margins in wires and higher share of export revenue QoQ. Profit grew 11% on-year.Shares of Polycab are currently trading 1.27% higher on Thursday at \u20b96,242.60. This stock has gained over 50% in the last one year."

            "article_content": "Star Wars is ripe territory for fan theories, though they don\u2019t always last very long. The fandom has hosted some incredible armchair writers over the years, and has always pivoted with new information and revelations. Many of the most popular theories have been shot down in recent years with the release of the sequel trilogy and the Disney+ shows, but the new ones cropping up are exciting. Meanwhile, the theories with the largest scope are still on the table \u2014 and will remain so unless Lucasfilm tackles some uncharacteristically big questions about the origins of the galactic infrastructure.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nStar Wars works best by appealing to a wide audience, so it rarely gets as deep into the minutiae of worldbuilding as other sci-fi franchises. If anything, that just leaves more room for fans to explore and flesh out their own ideas. Here are ten of the best Star Wars fan theories that are still viable at the time of this writing.\n\nShmi\u2019s Death\n\nOne of the biggest turning points in Anakin\u2019s path to the Dark Side came at the end of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, when he witnessed his mother\u2019s death. Shmi Skywalker was freed from slavery but was then kidnapped by Tusken Raiders and tortured, for reasons we don\u2019t fully understand. Fans now suggest that Shmi\u2019s death was orchestrated by Palpatine as part of his plan to corrupt Anakin and turn him to the Dark Side.\n\nThis idea picked up a lot of traction after Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett premiered, allowing the audience to spend more time among the Tusken Raiders. They are known to attack moisture farms like the one Shmi lived on, but it\u2019s unclear why they held her and brutalized her for so long without demanding a ransom or taking further action against her farm. It\u2019s possible that Palpatine was exerting some mental influence on this tribe to make the treatment of Shmi worse. He may also have influenced the prophetic dreams that sent Anakin looking for her.\n\nThis all becomes extra tragic if you believe that Palpatine is the one who used the Force to conceive Anakin with Shmi. However, some fans dislike this idea because it removes Anakin\u2019s culpability for the murders he committed here. It doesn\u2019t need to be true, but it could be.\n\nClone Wars Propaganda\n\nThere are two animated series that cover wartime events between Star Wars: Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith \u2014 Star Wars: Clone Wars, which aired from 2003 to 2005, and Star Wars: The Clone Wars which aired from 2008 to 2013. Reddit user u/onex7805 suggests that the first series was a faithful depiction of the war, while the second was in-world propaganda created by the Galactic Republic. This is a really interesting idea, and it\u2019s consistent with what we see in other Star Wars media as well.\n\nStormtrooper Armor\n\nThere are two popular and interesting theories about the purpose and efficacy of stormtrooper armor. It doesn\u2019t seem to protect its wearers very well, but many fans have suggested that this wasn\u2019t its main point. Instead, they figure the armor was meant to project strength and intimidation while hiding any humanity that might be lurking within the helmet. It\u2019s a way for the cloners on Kamino and the Empire to make their armies look more terrifying.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t contradict an interesting theory by Reddit user u/stormtrooper1701 \u2014 that stormtrooper armor actually does perform very well considering what it\u2019s up against. They point out that a direct hit from a blaster is incredibly destructive to property and the environment, so the same must be true for living beings. If it weren\u2019t for the armor, stormtroopers might be blown to bits much more easily.\n\nFranchise Crossovers\n\nThere are several popular fan theories online that suggest Star Wars takes place in the same universe as other movies or media, and some of them make pretty compelling cases. One of the strongest is Men in Black \u2014 the movie tells us that George Lucas is secretly an alien refugee living on Earth. It would make sense that he wrote his movies about his real experiences a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. There are other connections, as well, such as some similar character designs for aliens and a fictional language that sounds suspiciously like Huttese.\n\nMovies about aliens visiting Earth are easy to connect to Star Wars, which is why some fans think E.T. may have come from the Galactic Empire, for example. Meanwhile, connections to Doctor Who are subtle but common. There are many canonical stories that connect Star Wars to Marvel Comics, and in fact, many fans expect Disney to start exploiting this connection soon in movies and TV shows. However, the genre-bending connections get more and more tenuous, such as this one suggesting that The Lord of the Rings\u2018 Middle-earth is an ancient version of Tattooine.\n\nGrogu\u2019s Origin\n\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot about the origin and backstory of the Mandalorian foundling Grogu \u2014 a.k.a. The Child, a.k.a. Baby Yoda \u2014 but there are still some built-in mysteries surrounding his species and its connection to the Force. One theory that took off when The Mandalorian first premiered suggests that Grogu was born through the will of the Force \u2014 and perhaps that\u2019s how all members of this species are born.\n\nAll the sources on the Star Wars timeline agree that Grogu was born 41 years before Star Wars: A New Hope, which is the same year that Anakin Skywalker was born. The movies tell us that Anakin was an immaculate conception and that either Darth Sidious or his master Darth Plagueis used the Dark Side of the Force to create him. This theory suggests that there was an equal and opposite reaction and that Grogu was created in the same way through the light side of the Force.\n\nWhat makes this theory really exciting is its potential to reveal more about Grogu and Yoda\u2019s species in general. It could be that these beings are always born through the Force, and only when they are needed. However, all Star Wars writers have always shied away from revealing anything about Yoda\u2019s species \u2014 even its name \u2014 so it\u2019s hard to imagine them revealing something this big in The Mandalorian & Grogu.\n\nPalpatine\u2019s Return\n\nWhile the details of Yoda\u2019s species are the kind of mysteries we want to see teased out slowly, there\u2019s a more ominous fan theory that it may be used to explain one of Star Wars\u2019 most hasty and disliked plot points in the modern era: Palpatine\u2019s return. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker shows us that Palpatine survived Star Wars: Return of the Jedi or was resurrected, and he lived in secret for a generation before making his play for power again. However, the particulars of this plan are left vague, and it feels extremely disconnected from the rest of the sequel trilogy\u2019s plot.\n\nThe theory is that Grogu has been built up to become the connective tissue between this storyline and the rest of the fandom. Fans suggest that Grogu\u2019s cells were used by Palpatine\u2019s remaining loyalists for cloning experiments that were intended to bring the Emperor back \u2014 and perhaps to imbue him with new powers. They would have been hunting The Child to continue this work, and their failure would explain why Palpatine returned in an imperfect form in the later movie.\n\nSkywalkers\n\nStar Wars has not moved its timeline forward since 2019, and fans are itching to know what the next era in galactic history will look like. One popular theory connects the titles of the two most recent movies to suggest a new trend \u2014 there will be no more \u201cJedi\u201d after the Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Instead, Force-users will now be referred to as Skywalkers, which is why the finale was titled The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nThis may seem like a small, semantic change, but it could actually signal a wide range of interesting developments. If Force-users were freed from the connotations of the title Jedi and all the traditions of that order, they could develop a whole range of new practices and philosophies, perhaps even splintering into groups that develop independently and eventually go on to learn from each other. The catch-all term \u201cSkywalker\u201d would be a neat nod to the past and would also make sense of Rey\u2019s self-appointed name in the end. Fans have compared this to the way that \u201cCaesar\u201d started as one man\u2019s name, but went on to become a title for Roman leaders.\n\nBalance\n\nThere\u2019s a small subgenre of fan theories that neatly explain plot holes and inconsistencies by suggesting that the Force itself seeks balance at all times. It bothers some fans that, during the prequel trilogy, the massive and powerful Jedi order was unable to sense Palpatine and stop him, while a single under-trained Jedi was able to do so just a few years later. This theory essentially suggests that the more Jedi there are, the less powerful each one will be, as the Force will seek to maintain balance between the Dark Side and the light. This means Luke was tapping into a much larger well of potential energy and Palpatine had much less influence over him.\n\nSimilarly, some fans think that Palpatine\u2019s rise was inevitable in a time when the Jedi were so numerous and so involved in worldly affairs like politics and trade. They argue that a Jedi Order which couldn\u2019t stop a single Sith was somehow imperfect, and it needed to be toppled to make room for something better. This could be an interesting idea to explore in the future, if it can be done without excusing any of the emperor\u2019s crimes.\n\nDroid Villains\n\nLooking ahead, there\u2019s an interesting theory out there suggesting that whenever the Star Wars timeline does move forward again, its next big arc will be a conflict between droids and organic life. This idea has been circulating for at least a few years now, but it has become even more appealing since the finale of Star Wars: Skeleton Crew revealed that the planet At Attin was under the control of one massive AI. There has also been a recent trend in Star Wars media commenting on the relatively low social and economic status of droids throughout the series, with Solo: A Star Wars Story essentially depicting them as an oppressed class.\n\nThe Force may be powerful, but it would have some trouble contending with a hive mind, or even a coordinated force of self-improving droids. Add to that the moral complexity of the droids\u2019 plight and you could have a very interesting story on your hands \u2014 likely one with a solution more nuanced than blowing up another planet-killing space station.\n\nAttachment\n\nFinally, fans may have stumbled upon a practical reason for one of the Jedi Order\u2019s more lofty, philosophical teachings \u2014 their quest to sever all worldly attachments. Of course, early on Lucas drew this from Buddhist teachings and other real-world philosophies, but it became a very central part of the story when attachment to Padme helped drive Anakin to the Dark Side in the prequel trilogy.\n\nReddit user u/Nofrillsoculus suggests that this was precisely why potential Jedi needed to be found and indoctrinated early. A Force user with loyalties and ties to their family, nation, or planet will almost certainly become corrupted, and the galaxy would gradually devolve into a nonstop struggle between Force-sensitive warlords, or Sith. The Jedi want to avoid this, but there\u2019s still something sinister about the idea of them tracking down every single Force-sensitive child and pulling them away from their lives as early as possible.\n\nThe Star Wars franchise is streaming now on Disney+. The next release will be Andor Season 2, hitting Disney+ on April 22nd."

LAPRESSE\n\nIn a series of perplexing events, multiple UFO sightings have been reported and recorded over several days across California, particularly in the Fresno area. These sightings have sparked a wave of curiosity and concern, as both residents and authorities are left pondering the origins of these unidentified flying objects.\n\nThe string of sightings began with a mysterious light hovering over downtown Fresno in the early hours, just past 4 a.m. Local news station Fox 26 captured the first sighting on camera, showing a light that appeared to move swiftly before coming to a stationary hover. Earl Grey Anderson, a field investigator for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), reviewed the footage and classified it as an unidentified flying object.\n\nTaylor Swift's Heartfelt Message to Swifties\n\nThe following day, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara documented another UFO sighting, this time in the daylight. The footage added to the mounting intrigue surrounding these mysterious occurrences. A few days later, a private pilot reported seeing a white object trailing his aircraft at an altitude of 3,500 feet over downtown Fresno. Despite radioing the local airport tower for assistance, the pilot lost sight of the object shortly after.\n\nStill concern over what happened\n\nSeveral Fresno residents have also come forward with similar reports, describing their encounters with the unidentified objects. The recent sightings have reignited public fascination with UFOs, particularly as the Pentagon continues to release declassified information about aerial phenomena.\n\nWhile some speculate about extraterrestrial origins, others consider the possibility of advanced human-made technology or natural phenomena. Authorities are urging residents to remain calm as investigations continue.\n\nDespite the ongoing mystery, the sightings have undoubtedly captured the imaginations of those who witness these unexplained objects in the California skies. As the story develops, residents and authorities alike remain vigilant, hoping to uncover the truth behind these enigmatic appearances."

            "article_content": "Humans' outer ears may have evolved from the gills of prehistoric fish, a new study finds.\n\nGene-editing experiments indicate that cartilage in fish gills migrated into the ear canal millions of years ago during the course of our evolution . Going even further back, our outer ears may have evolutionary roots in ancient marine invertebrates, such as horseshoe crabs , scientists say.\n\nThe research sheds new light on the mysterious origins of outer ears, which are unique to mammals. \"When we started the project, the evolutionary origin of the outer ear was a complete black box,\" study co-author Gage Crump , a professor of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at the University of Southern California, said in a statement .\n\nResearchers already knew that our middle ears \u2014 each of which sits behind the eardrum and comprises three small bones \u2014 arose from the jawbones of ancient fish. This example of evolution transforming and repurposing anatomical structures \"made us wonder whether the cartilaginous outer ear may also have arisen from some ancestral fish structure,\" Crump said.\n\nRelated: I'm an evolutionary biologist who investigates real-time evolution in bacteria. These are my 5 must-read science books.\n\nOur outer ears and those of other mammals are made of a subtype of cartilage called elastic cartilage. It is more flexible than either hyaline cartilage or fibrocartilage, which are present in the human nose and in the disks between our vertebrae, respectively.\n\nThe key to tracing the origins of humans' outer ears to fish was the discovery that elastic cartilage is also present in fish gills. \"When we started the study, there was very little out there about whether elastic cartilage existed outside of mammals,\" Crump said.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe researchers used protein stains to reveal that the gills of zebrafish (Danio rerio), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and three other species of fish contain elastic cartilage. The species are all modern bony fishes, suggesting that elastic cartilage is a general feature in this group, according to the study, which was published Jan. 9 in the journal Nature .\n\nNext, the scientists tested the evolutionary link between elastic cartilage in fish gills and mammalian outer ears. Elastic cartilage doesn't preserve well in fossils, so the researchers used molecular clues instead. They looked for gene control elements called \"enhancers\" \u2014 short DNA sequences that can activate associated genes when bound by specific proteins.\n\nA gene control element for human outer ear development shows activity in the gills (green) of a zebrafish. (Image credit: Mathi Thiruppathy/Crump Lab/USC Stem Cell)\n\nBecause genetic enhancers are highly tissue-specific, researchers can easily detect where the enhancers are active. To test whether enhancer activity \u2014 and therefore gene regulation \u2014 is similar in fish gills and human outer ears, Crump and his colleagues inserted human outer ear enhancers into zebrafish genomes.\n\nThe experiment triggered activity in the gills of zebrafish, hinting at an ancestral link between the genes in human outer ears and fish gills. Then, the researchers conducted the experiment in reverse: They inserted enhancers associated with zebrafish gills into mouse genomes and detected activity in the mice's outer ears.\n\nThrough another series of experiments with tadpoles and green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis), the team showed that amphibians and reptiles also inherited their gill and ear structures from fish. In lizards, enhancer activity was in the ear canal, which suggests that elastic cartilage had begun migrating from the gills to the outer ear by the time reptiles appeared on Earth around 315 million years ago.\n\n\"Our findings suggest that elements of an ancestral gill developmental program were reutilized multiple times through the course of vertebrate evolution to generate diverse gill and ear structures,\" the researchers wrote in the study.\n\nFinally, the team found an enhancer in horseshoe crab cells that triggered activity in zebrafish gills. Horseshoe crabs are \"living fossils\" that emerged around 400 million years ago, and the discovery suggests our outer ears may have much deeper evolutionary roots than previously thought.\n\nAlthough more research is needed to confirm how deep these roots stretch, \"this work provides a new chapter to the evolution of the mammalian ear,\" Crump said."
