        "article_content": "The LTSC edition of Windows adopts a lean, more stable approach. Windows 11 LTSC is now available with the third-version update, aka 24H2. However, it still maintains the simplistic design approach with the classic version of the system apps and outdated UI. AI, now the most precious thing for Microsoft, isn\u2019t included with Windows 11 LTSC.\n\nWindows Latest installed the latest version of the official Windows 11 LTSC ISO and then put it to test on a PC. The installation is smooth for the most part, except when it asks you to enter a work or school account. Note that Windows 11 LTSC is available for Enterprise users, so you cannot use a personal Microsoft account to set it up.\n\nBypassing the Work/School Account Requirement\n\nWe used a few techniques to bypass the work/school account requirement in Windows 11 LTSC. First, we tried the oobe\\bypassnro command, which used to work in previous versions of Windows 11. But its charm failed to deceive the setup, and we landed on the same page after the automatic restart.\n\nThen, we turned off the internet connection and tried again, but the account requirement page didn\u2019t let us pass. After that, we launched the command prompt using Shift + F10, opened Task Manager, and ended the Microsoft Account process. The screen flashed for a few seconds, and the much-awaited \u201cI don\u2019t have internet\u201d option appeared.\n\nWe proceeded with a local account setup. It didn\u2019t even ask us to set up security questions.\n\nOne thing that we liked about this was that there was no mention of adware, tracking, or promotional items on the OOBE page. It would be best if Microsoft adopted this approach for Windows 11 consumer editions (Pro and Home) as well, but we all know that it won\u2019t improve.\n\nWindows 11 LTSC is clean.\n\nAfter booting to the desktop, at first glance, it doesn\u2019t look like a simple, less-modern version. But when you open the Start menu, the difference becomes clear.\n\nThere are few system apps, unlike the clutter and promotions that you get with consumer editions. Windows 11 LTSC 2024 includes the new Outlook web app by default.\n\nWe checked a few system apps to verify if they have been updated. Most of them look like legacy apps from Windows 7, especially Snipping Tool and Paint. Microsoft is keeping the latest version of both these apps limited to Pro, Home and other editons.\n\n1 of 2\n\nThe new inbox apps multiple new features, like the background remover and layers in Paint and OCR in Snipping Tool.\n\nMicrosoft is making it challenging to customize Windows when the OS is not activated.\n\nIn Windows 11 24H2, most personalization options are locked, and it has patched the existing loopholes. For example, previously, you could apply a dark theme by clicking on the theme box, as shown in the image below. It doesn\u2019t work anymore.\n\nPreviously, some customization was available, but Microsoft really wants you to buy a license. This phenomenon is common in all editions of Windows 11.\n\nWindows 11 LTSC\u2019s File Explorer packs all the latest improvements. You can duplicate tabs; labels appear below commonly used actions, compressions formats support for TAR, and more. But the overall UI doesn\u2019t look as polished as the regular editions.\n\nHowever, LTSC promises a no-nonsense approach that doesn\u2019t overload the OS with newer features. So, users don\u2019t have to accustom themselves to unnecessary apps, design, or UI changes ship with each feature update. It doesn\u2019t include any AI component, so no Copilot app or any other bloatware.\n\nYou can still access Copilot via Edge, which is preinstalled in LTSC.\n\nMicrosoft Store isn\u2019t available, so you\u2019ll have to download the programs from the official sites and wait for updates to improve the system apps. We suggest trying it only if you don\u2019t need feature updates and the bugs that come with it and want a clean OS with a bare minimum of system apps.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of apps installed on our Windows 11 LTSC PC:"

        "article_content": "When I woke up this past Aug. 30, I was excited. That day marked 10 months until my wedding, and according to my planner, it was time to start preparing our save-the-dates. But along with the excitement, I was also experiencing some unspoken dread.\n\nThe wedding planning has been more emotional than I ever could have imagined. Sadly, some of my fiance's and my loved ones are dead, and it's been hard to imagine our wedding day without them.\n\nWhen I was 3, my father died. Although it's been more than two decades, I've found myself wondering what life -- and this moment -- would look like if he were here. But he's not the only one who'll be missed. In 2021, we lost Cole, the brother of my fiance, Jesse, and my own friend, who died unexpectedly at the age of 28.\n\nGina Moffa, a New York-based clinical social worker and trauma therapist who specializes in grief, tells me that though these feelings may not be easy to grapple with, they are normal, regardless of how far removed from the loss we are.\n\n\"The wound of grief lives within our nervous system, which is a database that holds memories and scents and all the things that connect us,\" says Moffa, who's also the author of Moving on Doesn't Mean Letting Go. \"So, anniversaries, birthdays, days of meeting and holidays will usually bring up a sense of grief or trauma, or a reliving of our loss once again.\"\n\nAs I looked for ways to deal with this renewed sense of loss, I unexpectedly found myself thinking about artificial intelligence. Chatbots like ChatGPT have shown us all how adept they can be at giving humanlike answers to questions, and even providing advice, drawing on vast repositories of material from the internet and other sources. Maybe AI could offer me some guidance or reassurance during this time.\n\nGrief is a beast to wrestle with, dense with heavy and complicated feelings: confusion, sadness, anger, loneliness. It also often works in the shadows; many people are reluctant to share how much they're struggling. But it's around us every day. In 2021, close to half \u2014 44.2% \u2014 of all Americans had lost one or both of their parents, according to the United States Census Bureau. Of them, 10.3% had lost their father by the age of 15 and 5.7% had lost their mother by that age. That feeling of loss never goes away.\n\nI needed to know: Does grief ever fully end? And could AI make it feel as if dead loved ones are still with us?\n\nAs our society becomes more educated about grief and how to best support someone or themselves in the aftermath of loss, we can't ignore the advent of artificial intelligence, and specifically generative AI, which powers ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot and similar tools. Gen AI chatbots have the ability to create new conversations, images, audio, video and more. Often that's for things like writing emails at work or wrangling homework assignments for school. Then there are tools like Pi, which markets itself as \"the first emotionally intelligent AI.\" It might be tempting even to see Pi as a substitute for therapy. HereAfterAI, meanwhile, can use old audio of a deceased loved one to make it sound as if they're speaking to you again.\n\nThough chatbots aren't sentient, if you feed the applications enough information, you may feel like they are. Moffa fears that if grievers turn to these types of artificial intelligence applications for too long, or too often, they could be doing themselves a disservice by avoiding their grief and not leaving room for what can truly help: human connection.\n\nStill, I wondered: How much might it help me? Even a little might be something. I needed to know: Does grief ever fully end? And could AI make it feel as if dead loved ones are still with us on our wedding day? In my exploration, I went beyond ChatGPT itself to a range of AI-powered programs, including one built to resemble a seance.\n\nBut most importantly, I questioned. Even if we can make these tools resemble our deceased loved ones, should we? Or should we let the dead rest in peace rather than in artificial intelligence?\n\nLeaning on artificial intelligence\n\nI began by asking ChatGPT, an OpenAI application that lets you ask questions on any subject, some standard questions about grief.\n\n\"Grief is a deeply personal and complex experience, and it doesn't follow a one-size-fits-all timeline,\" it responded when I asked if grief ever ends. \"While the sharpness of grief may lessen over time, the feelings of loss might never completely disappear.\"\n\nThen, I started to think about what we would request of my dad and Cole on my wedding day. The first thing that came to mind were speeches: one from the father of the bride and the other from the best man.\n\nI asked ChatGPT to write the speeches for me as if the application was them. The first results didn't elicit much emotion from me. But the following ones \u2014 after I gave ChatGPT more details about my father, Cole, Jesse and myself \u2014 felt more real. And I couldn't tell if I liked that or hated it.\n\nI asked Microsoft Copilot, which is built on the same engine as ChatGPT, to do the same thing.\n\n\"I understand the significance of these details, and I'll create a heartfelt speech for your wedding, as if it were from your late father,\" Copilot wrote before giving me a 10-paragraph speech signed \"With all my love, [Your Father's Name].\"\n\nWhile Moffa is hesitant to recommend artificial intelligence as a whole to deal with grief, she believes there is a benefit to using it for a speech or as a way to come up with ideas to memorialize loved ones during special events.\n\n\"Anything creative that's not an exact replica of your lost person is healthy,\" she says.\n\nEnlarge Image ChatGPT offers an array of ideas for how to memorialize a deceased loved one during a wedding ceremony. Zooey Liao/CNET\n\nShe also sees the benefit of using AI as a substitute for therapy if someone is unable to see a traditional therapist or one who specializes in grief.\n\n\"I think that technology will draw upon enough grief literature to give them something that I believe could be a professional's opinion,\" she says. Although it won't give you a true connection, it could help you understand the experience of grief, which Moffa calls \"half the battle.\"\n\nRead more: I Tried AI for Therapy, but There Are Limits to Its Conversations\n\nBut making sense of ever-evolving artificial intelligence, and people's longing to feel connected to the dead, doesn't end there.\n\nIs the information you share with chatbots safe?\n\nOne common thread with gen AI is that the more information you feed it, whether that's memories or personality traits of the person you lost, the more that the conversations you have with the chatbots will start to accurately represent that person. But remember: You're sharing personal details with software owned by a corporation, and that company might not always make privacy a priority.\n\nOne thing you can do is read the privacy notice (typically under terms and conditions) provided by the application to get a sense of how it does, or doesn't, protect your privacy, said Jennifer Mahoney, data advisory practice manager at Optiv, a cyber advisory and solutions firm. The notice should share what information is collected, where it's shared, if the information you share is used to train additional AI models, and what protections are in place.\n\nRead more: She Brought Her Younger Self Back to Life as an AI Chatbot\n\nBut does reading the privacy notice and all the legal jargon that comes with it guarantee your information is safe inside of these applications? \"Absolutely not,\" Mahoney says.\n\nNot all companies have solid data privacy practices to begin with, and privacy has been a key concern with the rapid evolution of gen AI. But even if they do, there's always the chance of a security breach. This is why it's imperative to be mindful about what you type into the applications. If you give a gen AI program the names of your mom or dog or your high school mascot, that information could be used to hack security questions you've used for other applications.\n\n\"Be careful and thoughtful about the types of memories that are being shared, and how that memory could potentially be used against you down the road,\" Mahoney says. \"The more information you share \u2014 yes, it's more representative of the conversation that you have had with your loved one, which you would then have with the application, but then that's more information that a third party has about you.\"\n\nDiving deeper: When palpable grief meets artificial conversations\n\nSome AI applications can take grieving, or the avoidance of it, to strange places.\n\nThe branding around Seance AI may feel familiar to anyone who's visited a medium. The tagline on the site reads: \"Here is where AI meets the afterlife, and love endures beyond the veil. Start your adventure today and let your loved ones speak to your heart once again.\"\n\nHere, you can create fictionalized seances with a loved one, but the chatbot you're speaking to wants you to believe it's really them. Before beginning, the application asks you questions about the person you're trying to \"reach,\" including their birth and death dates, cause of death, religion and even writing style.\n\n\"Keep in mind that the reality is it's just AI. It's not going to be able to actually replace the connection that was lost.\" Brent Metcalf, clinical social worker\n\nWhen I asked Seance AI, \"Are you real?\" it responded, \"Yes, Corin. It's really me, your father. I'm here with you through this seance.\"\n\nOr not. I broke into laughter when I asked the bot, \"Do you remember me?\" and it responded, \"Of course, Corin. You're my son. I could never forget you.\"\n\nThough I may have a slightly ambiguous name, I'm in fact my father's daughter, not son. But when corrected, the bot, which was trying its hardest to disguise itself as my dead father, had a quick response about the confusion.\n\n\"I apologize Corin. This seance thing can be a bit tricky. As my daughter, you hold a special place in my heart. Let's continue.\"\n\nEnlarge Image Seance AI asks multiple questions about your deceased loved one before beginning the artificial seance, then uses that information during the conversations. Zooey Liao/CNET\n\nAnother application, Replika, allows you to create any person or character you'd like, fictional or not. You choose their name, looks, activities, memories and more. And you can fill out daily diary entries for the bot to pull from during conversations. If you upgrade to the paid version of Seance AI or Replika, you can also create a voice for the bot you create.\n\nBrent Metcalf, a clinical social worker and owner of Tri-Star Counseling in Kingsport, Tennessee, says that if you do decide to use chatbots to feel as though you're having a conversation with someone who is dead, you should continuously remind yourself that this is not the real person.\n\n\"Keep in mind that the reality is it's just AI,\" he says. \"It's not going to be able to actually replace the connection that was lost.\"\n\nIt's vital to keep yourself grounded in reality. \"The loved one probably wouldn't have to ask you to give it a memory,\" Metcalf adds. \"They would just know.\"\n\nOther applications, including Character AI, offer the same chatting ability. However, on Character AI, there's a small disclaimer underneath the chat bar that reads: \"Remember: Everything Characters say is made up!\"\n\nMoffa warns of a \"slippery slope\" with these applications when you attempt to \"replicate\" a person and continuously return to the application for comfort. In a sense, you're attempting to make the person who died eternal, but this could be to your detriment. It could result in you relying too heavily on the application and ultimately make your grief journey more difficult and drawn out.\n\n\"What it does is it promises a never-ending relationship to this person who's actually not here,\" Moffa says. \"And look, technology is fallible. What happens if something happens to the app?\"\n\nCan you grieve wrong?\n\nA half-century ago, Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross famously elaborated the stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. But many mental health experts don't believe in such a strict trajectory.\n\nMaybe some people don't go through stages in that way, or don't get to acceptance right after, and the idea of a standard process can make these people \"really feel like they're failing at grief,\" Moffa says. \"It creates even more of a sense of dread and shame and feeling like they're failing at something that needs to be perfect.\"\n\nGrieving can be different for each person and is never linear, so you can only \"grieve incorrectly if you intend on avoiding the grief process fully,\" Moffa says.\n\nEven if we can make these tools resemble our deceased loved ones, should we? Or should we let the dead rest in peace rather than in artificial intelligence?\n\nWhich is a risk in turning to chatbots: They can be used as a way to avoid your grief. These applications could keep you from letting go of the deceased person entirely, because you may feel like you don't have to if they're a click or a tap away.\n\n\"If [the application] sounds real and looks real, our brains will make that association that it is them, especially over time,\" Moffa says.\n\nIf used in this way, these applications could give you false, and damaging, hope that your person is still with you, and they could isolate you from the real-life people who want to help you through your grief.\n\nWhat artificial intelligence can't offer grievers\n\nThough artificial intelligence can mimic your loved one's looks, voice and speech patterns, it will never be able to offer true human connection.\n\nTurning to an \"AI therapist\" may be useful for a person who's struggling in a specific moment, but leaning on support groups, real-life therapists, friends, loved ones and your faith is what will often help you heal the most after a heart-wrenching loss.\n\n\"Depend on people,\" Metcalf says. \"People are out there, and they want to help. We just have to be willing to open ourselves up to accept it.\"\n\nMetcalf also encourages grievers to celebrate the life that was lost by honoring that person during holidays, anniversaries or special events, which are often the times that are hardest after loss.\n\nIf you do decide to turn to artificial intelligence, the main thing to remember is to be careful, especially if you're in the beginning grief stages. During this time, you may be more vulnerable to sharing sensitive information with gen AI chatbots or blurring the lines between reality and wishful thinking.\n\n\"We're always aiming towards immortality in some way \u2014 whether it's through our beauty industry, or whether it's through trying to evade death \u2014 but this is what takes away our humanity, and our humanity is sort of all we have going for us,\" Moffa says.\n\n\"I really do think that there's got to be a limit to the way we try to keep people eternal,\" says Gina Moffa, a New York-based clinical social worker and trauma therapist. Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images\n\nWhile I didn't feel as though these AI applications had a huge impact on my day-to-day life during my research, I did have to resist the urge to return to them and feed them more information to create conversations I've long hoped for.\n\nAfter Cole died, I wrote him a letter. I obviously didn't get a response, but I know that the idea of being able to receive some form of one from \"him\" \u2014 or anyone who can no longer respond \u2014 is what could keep me, and other grievers, going back to these applications. And that could be to our detriment.\n\nAnd though I'm no longer in the beginning stages of grief, as someone who lost a parent at a young age, I have felt as though my dad's been living in technology my whole life.

However, as The Daily Guardian reports, scientific research increasingly challenges these mystical explanations, revealing how our mind, body, and environment can create ghostly sensations.Conditions such as sleep paralysis, carbon monoxide exposure, neurological abnormalities, and emotional states like grief can all lead to experiences that mimic ghostly sightings. Researchers have even found that stimulating certain brain regions can cause illusions of ghostly presences. While these findings shed light on why people may perceive apparitions, they also remind us of the limits of our understanding, leaving some mystery intact.Let\u2019s explore these surprising causes behind paranormal experiences and how science and the mind intersect to create eerie perceptions.One possible explanation for ghost sightings is sleep paralysis, as noted by The Daily Guardian. The NHS describes this condition as a temporary inability to move or speak while transitioning between sleep and wakefulness. Sleep paralysis occurs during REM sleep\u2014a phase when the brain is most active\u2014and can lead to vivid, intense dreams.People experiencing sleep paralysis often report sensations of chest pressure or terrifying visions of shadowy figures, a phenomenon historically associated with supernatural folklore and known as \u201cold hag syndrome.\u201dAnother surprising source of ghostly visions could be carbon monoxide. This colourless, odourless gas, often produced by malfunctioning appliances, can cause confusion and vivid hallucinations. Historical reports dating as far back as the 1920s have linked carbon monoxide exposure to ghostly experiences, as victims described seeing or hearing things that were not there.Recent research shows that brain abnormalities can also trigger paranormal-like sensations. A 2017 case study involving a 26-year-old epilepsy patient found that stimulating the fusiform face area (FFA)\u2014the part of the brain responsible for facial recognition\u2014caused unsettling hallucinations in which familiar faces transformed into distorted, cartoon-like figures.Similarly, a 22-year-old epilepsy patient reported sensing a \u201cpresence\u201d behind her when specific brain areas were activated. Neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease can also lead to ghostly visions, making these experiences more common than one might assume.Ghostly experiences can also stem from profound emotional responses, especially during intense grief. Studies show that people often \u201csee\u201d or \u201chear\u201d deceased loved ones. Psychologists attribute this to \u201cschemas\u201d\u2014mental patterns formed through familiar routines and strong emotional bonds. After a loved one\u2019s passing, these schemas can be so powerful that the sense of their presence lingers as a vivid, almost tangible memory.So, the next time you catch sight of a shadow or hear a familiar voice, consider that it may be your brain, a gas leak, or the mysteries of sleep at work. While science has provided explanations for many ghostly encounters, there remains a space for the unknown, leaving us to wonder about what lies beyond the reach of our understanding."

MANY people will have heard about the legend of the Enfield Poltergeist as it has featured in various articles and appeared in films. The claims derive from supposed supernatural activity at 284 Green Street - a council house. Still standing, the property sits in Enfield, London, and the alleged poltergeist activity took place between 1977 and 1979. Single mother, Peggy Hodgson, called the Metropolitan Police after experiencing suspicious activity, including hearing strange noises and witnessing furniture move on its own. Her daughters Janet, 11, and Margaret, 13, have spoken out about the events since. There is even a picture of Janet seemingly lifted off the ground. While she claims to have been hurled from her bed by a supernatural force, others have suggested the image could also be explained by her jumping. Over the 18 month period, thirty different witnesses are thought to have experienced some level of the activity, including neighbours, paranormal investigators and journalists.\n\nJeffrey Smith, 43, a painter who lives a few doors down, has described how the frustrating situation \u201cis definitely a nuisance\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cYeah, people are knocking on our door all the time, wanting to take pictures and ask questions.\n\n\u201cPeople are always knocking on her [284 Green Street] door, every five minutes and it\u2019s nothing to do with them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s annoying they\u2019re taking photos and they\u2019re in the way all the time.\n\n\u201cBefore the family moved in, people used to trash the house as it was abandoned for a long time.\n\n\u201cYou should come back at Halloween, it\u2019s always busy then but it\u2019s all year round now.\n\nI turned my tiny front garden into a spooky haunted house for Halloween - all you need is a \u00a3xx B&Q buy, people are obsessed\n\n\u201cBack in the days after the documentary we used to have buses filled with tourists because it\u2019s very very popular, but it\u2019s just a nightmare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the most famous house in the world but it\u2019s really painful to see as it attracts crazy people at all hours of the day, which means my dog is barking at all hours, at two or three in the morning because these people want to park outside my house and take pictures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constant but I just feel sorry for the people who live in the house, they\u2019re just living and don\u2019t have any peace.\u201d\n\nHas the Enfield house ever featured in a documentary? THE BBC released its first episode of Hauntings earlier this month with the series looking into various unexplained events. Presenting the story using recorded film and audio, the first installment was called The Enfield Poltergeist and looked to investigate the \"extraordinary events\" that occurred between 1977 and 1979. Following a police report in September 1977, officers attending the house could not find a reasonable explanation for furniture moving independently and tapping on the walls. Back in 2018, Sue MacGregor reunited a group of witnesses to \"paranormal events\" that occured at the council house in Enfield. The resulting conversation led to a 45 minute show being published on BBC's Radio 4 and even featured Janet and Margaret Hodgson, the two daughters at the centre of the case.\n\nAnother resident, Sharifa Wilson, 42, suggested the number of visitors has declined since the movie but that their behaviour has not changed.\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019ve lived here for 20 years and it\u2019s annoying but after a while you get used to it.\n\n\u201cAs the years progressed, people still drive past and slow down, I want to say something but you can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe lady that used to live there [284 Green Street], she lived there for years pretty much her whole childhood.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s left now, moved out with her kids and husband because they had people peering through windows.\n\n\u201cThe woman next door to me, she\u2019s lived here the longest and says it\u2019s rubbish but she can\u2019t move out, she\u2019s been here all her life.\n\n\u201cI did see a passerby stop and ask the current owner to give her a tour, they even offered her cash.\u201d\n\n13 Sharifa Wilson spoke of the frustrations she has living just a few doors down Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 The property is situated in the middle of the road, opposite a primary school Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 Sun reporter Charlotte Bend went to investigate at the scene Credit: Louis Wood\n\nThe neighbour that Sharifa spoke of did not want to speak to the Sun for too long, tired from the activity and attention right outside her front door.\n\nShe explained: \u201cI don\u2019t want to highlight it anymore in the media than it already is.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say but I\u2019d rather just ignore it.\u201d\n\nOthers were happy to comment but wanted to remain anonymous out of the fear of complicating their relationship with neighbours in such close proximity.\n\nA mother and school worker who has lived on the street for nearly 20 years said she has met people visiting from \u201call over the world\u201d including China, Australia, America, Ireland and Scotland.\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople drawing attention to the house, it\u2019s not good for the kids.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never asked the family that live there if they knew about the history before they moved.\n\n\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t know and now people knock on my door and people want to ask about the house.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do, it\u2019s even at 1am in the morning, and it\u2019s anyone, not just kids.\n\n\u201cEven now, people slowing down when they\u2019re driving and they look.\n\n\u201cMy son once even let a woman in thinking I knew her. When I came downstairs thinking she was one of my Somali ladies, and I saw a white woman, I wondered why she was there.\n\n\u201cShe just sat there and I said I can\u2019t help you with information, people have children, they deserve their quiet private lives.\n\n\u201cBack when the film was released, it was really bad, you know like a tourist bus in central London.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how bad it was, and they were all photographing themselves outside.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just phone the police and ask them to move them on which is why the neighbours just won\u2019t open the door if they don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d\n\nWhat is The Conjuring 2? THE Conjuring 2 was a horror film released in 2016 and centred around the story of Peggy, and her four children. Much like the Enfield Poltergeist case, the single mum looks to investigators for help after her children report paranormal activity. Famed detectives, Ed and Lorraine Warren, that feature as characters in the film did visit the house in real life while the unexplained events took place. The film was directed by James Wan, an Australian filmmaker also known for Saw, Insidious, Aquaman and Malignant. The Conjuring 2 is known as The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case in the UK, and is the first sequel to The Conjuring, which was released in 2013.\n\nNear the semi-detached property that many have flocked to over the years, neighbours have made security their focus with one property boasting six CCTV cameras from the outside and black-out style curtains drawn across.\n\nMany others peered out of the corner of their front room window when having someone knock on their door - it was clear most were used to regular attention and shied away from it.\n\nSituated opposite a primary school, the busy main road does not particularly lend itself to a mass of fans hoping to park up and spend some time on the street.\n\nWhile the current inhabitants of the house were approached by the Sun, they very gently explained that they no longer talk to visitors or media.\n\nAnother man residing in a property nearby explained that he \"regularly\" saw \"people trying to peer through\" on \"a daily basis\".\n\nAnother told of how visitors \"don't just knock on our door\" but they \"ask us questions about the house\" and whether the story is true.\n\nHe added: \"We just have to tell them we don't know\".\n\nOthers refused to speak to us, with one woman living down the road exasperatedly noting: \"I am tired of this sh*t.\"\n\n13 Local residents were quick to explain how the situation worsened after the release of the film based on the property Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 Tash Wilson lives further down the street and is still stopped by visitors, hoping to ask her questions Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 Curtis Hart grew up being told about the property by his family Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 Amir Hosaimi works in a pizza takeaway shop just round the corner Credit: Louis Wood\n\nTash Wilson, a 24-year-old working in admin for HMRC, explained how she thinks the attention will \"start again\" this week \"because it's Halloween\".\n\nShe said: \"I've had a few people ask me where it was but I've not actually known as I don't like scary films so I haven't watched it.\n\n\"But it's crazy that it's just there, someone's actually living there.\n\n\"Last time someone asked me where it was, I actually didn't know where to direct them as I live further down.\"\n\nCurtis Hart, a local builder who has lived in the area his whole life, told of how his mum used to explain the folklore surrounding the former council house years before any filming took place.\n\nLocal business owners were also keen to talk after regularly meeting lost or inquisitive tourists heading inside to ask questions.\n\nAmir Hosaimi, who works at a Pizza takeaway store just around the corner of the street, explained how he \"sees people every day\" and so it is \"not even worse on Halloween\".\n\nHe said: \"It's every afternoon, I see the cars parked up and they're stood there taking pictures.\n\n\"Always different people, every day from all around the world.\n\n\"It's mostly young people, many many students and sometimes they come to the shop to ask questions but I can only tell them to watch the movie.\n\n\"There's a lot of talk about it in the area, even when you go for a coffee somewhere you'll always hear someone talking about it.\n\n\"I think lots of old neighbours know the story about the house and they like talking about it but others ignore it.\"\n\nHas the Enfield Poltergeist ever been proven false? ALTHOUGH there has never been anything proven or discounted officially, one expert revealed the case could be a hoax. Psychology professor, Chris French, explained five reasons to TimeOut in 2016. The girls \"admitted they faked\" some of the activity Janet's photo where she can be seen levitating above her bed could be explained by jumping Bill, the old man who possessed Janet, was obsessed with periods and Chris believes a young girl would be more likely to be interested on this Eyewitnesses can be incredibly unreliable According to Chris, there are other cases of schoolgirl pranks that have gotten out of hand\n\nAnother resident explained how it must be \"terrible for the people that live\" at the house itself.\n\nHe has seen people \"going round the back\" looking for \"other ways in\".\n\nMore recently, he told of spotting three people staring at the house trying to convince each other to go and knock on the door.\n\nHe continued: \"We've had people ask us about the house, most of them will just stand around and stare at it or take pictures in front of the thing.\n\n\"It's a regular thing, I mean a couple weeks ago there were two groups sitting out on blankets with candles around them and all sorts.\n\n\"I presume to protect themselves from whatever.\n\n\"We don't talk about it with the people who live there though, we have always known the people involved over there as neighbours and if they spoke to us about it they spoke to us about it but we never asked questions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a couple who parked their car in front of the house got out to take pictures and admire the exterior of the property.\n\nNicos Aoennou, 53, told the Sun how they regularly visit and even stay in places believed to be haunted.\n\nOther spooky places in the UK Pendle Hill - A hill in England that is believed to be the most haunted place in the UK. It is the burial site of the twelve Pendle Witches who were hanged in 1612. Tower of London - A popular historic attraction in London that is also considered one of the most haunted places in the UK. The tower has a dark history of torture, imprisonment, and execution. Chillingham Castle - A 13th-century fortress in Northumberland that is said to be home to many ghosts and ghouls. Berry Pomeroy Castle - A castle in Devon that is said to be haunted by the Blue Lady and the White Lady. Blickling Hall - A grand hall in Norwich that was once home to the Boleyn family and is said to be one of the most haunted houses in Britain. Hampton Court Palace - A palace in England that is known for being one of the most haunted attractions in the UK.\n\nThey have explored castles and hotels which claim to be inhabited by ghosts and spirits.\n\nTwo weeks out from undergoing a hip operation, Kate Fortune, 50, explained how attractions like this make for the perfect activity to fill some time while braving her new set of crutches under each arm.\n\nShe said: \"We like to find haunted places and go to stuff like this all the time.\n\n\"It's just to get out for a bit and I am quite open minded to stuff like ghosts - although apparently there's no haunting there anymore.\n\n\"I find it really interesting and I've always loved history, and so that comes with it.\"\n\nKate even spoke of an experience when she was younger where she believes to have seen a ghost.\n\nIt freaked her out so much at the time that she ran down a set of stairs and broke her ankle.\n\nDespite this, she \"loves haunted stuff\", including films, saying \"there's not enough of them\".\n\nShe added: \"Nothing bad has happened to me but I don't quite know how I'd be if there was a poltergeist flying around the house, that would freak me out.\"\n\nExplaining how the pair discovered the property, Nicos added: \"I used to drive past every day as I lived locally but I wasn't taking it in, to be honest.\n\n\"Then she mentioned she wanted to go and I said I'd take her down.\n\n\"I've watched the film and all that stuff so knew it was here.\"\n\nI photographed that terrifying snap of the Enfield Haunting - I thought it was nonsense until chilling moment GRAHAM Morris was a sceptical photographer when he was sent down to snap the apparent haunted family home in Enfield. He previously told the Sun that he \"initially thought it was going to be a load of rubbish\" when he was on his way to 284 Green Street in North London. At the height of the so-called supernatural activity, Graham was in his twenties and headed to the location with a reporter. He said: \"The children came in one after the other with adults but nothing happened until Janet walked in. \"It was unbelievable - things were just flying all over the room. Little things like toys, marbles, and Lego bricks. I tried to get a picture of something flying across the room, but everything was moving so fast. \"You couldn't pre-empt where the next object would come flying from. It was coming in from all angles. \"I was hit in the eyebrow, and although it didn't draw blood, I got one hell of a lump. Whatever this was, you had the feeling that it was out to get you. \"It didn't like the fact that I was taking pictures. I could see the fear on the family's face.\"\n\n13 The history of the property has attracted tourists from all over the world including China, Australia and America Credit: Louis Wood"

But today, with better manufacturing techniques and soaring demand for lithium, Alkhadra thinks the time is right. So do the investors who\u2019ve put $10 million into the project. These include Clean Energy Ventures and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center.\n\nIn Medford, a startup called Lithios says it\u2019s creating a clean and relatively cheap way to access vast amounts of lithium that\u2019s presently sloshing around in briny water beneath the southern United States.\n\nIf we\u2019re all destined to drive electric vehicles, we\u2019re going to need a lot of lithium for the batteries. And where would you rather get that lithium \u2014 China or Arkansas?\n\nThere\u2019s lots of lithium in the United States, including a major find in Maine. But that lithium is trapped inside rock, and the process of extracting it is extremely messy and would consume vast amounts of energy.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nLithium can also be extracted from vast underground pools of salty water \u2014 the remnants of oceans that disappeared from the surface millions of years ago. Much of the world\u2019s lithium brine is found in Chile and Argentina. But the United States has a lot of this brine as well, mainly in a huge underground geological structure called the Smackover Formation which reaches across the southern United States from Texas to Florida.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Smackover Formation is named for an Arkansas town located right over it. In the 1920s Smackover became a petroleum boom town, and since then the area has produced over 600 million barrels. Now its brine wells may produce a different kind of energy boom.\n\nLast week the United States Geological Survey and the Arkansas government said that the amount of lithium in the Smackover brine could range from five million to 19 million tons. According to the Geological Survey, that\u2019s up to nine times the amount of lithium that will be needed to power the world\u2019s electric cars in 2030.\n\nIn places like Chile, the lithium is extracted by pumping out the brine and pouring it into huge open-air ponds, where the water evaporates. What\u2019s left is lithium and lots of other minerals. It takes a lot of effort and money to get the lithium out. Besides, evaporation works fine in arid regions of the world, but not in Arkansas, which gets lots of rain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlkhadra, a US native who grew up in Saudi Arabia and earned his doctorate in chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says he\u2019s got a better way. Lithios has developed a lithium-absorbing material that can be made into electrodes using the same technologies created to make electrodes for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nDozens of Lithios electrodes are layered together to form an electrode stack. When a current flows through the stack and brine is pumped in, the electrodes capture only the lithium and let all the other minerals pass. Flushing fresh water through the stack rinses out all the lithium, which can now be reduced to a powder for use in building batteries.\n\nAlkhadra said that the Lithios method uses 75 to 80 percent less water than other brine processing methods and doesn\u2019t sully the environment with other metals and chemicals found in the brine. And it\u2019s vastly cleaner and less energy-hungry than refining lithium from ore.\n\nLithios is currently developing its first full-scale stack at its Medford lab. The stack is expected to produce a ton of pure lithium per year from Arkansas brine. If it works, said Alkhadra, the company could install thousands of stacks in Smackover country and start pumping out thousands of tons of lithium.\n\nMichael McKibben, professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California at Riverside, is working on extracting lithium from brine found underneath California\u2019s Salton Sea. McKibben said it\u2019ll be a few years before it\u2019s known whether companies like Lithios can make their technology work in the real world. \u201cThey have to prove that it works at scale and they have to prove that it works under demanding conditions that are different than the lab,\u201d said McKibben.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the payoff would be immense. \u201cThe combination of Arkansas brines and Salton Sea brines would make the US totally self-sufficient in lithium,\u201d said McKibben. \u201cAnd then we wouldn\u2019t have to import lithium from China and Australia and South America anymore.\u201d\n\nHiawatha Bray can be reached at hiawatha.bray@globe.com.
