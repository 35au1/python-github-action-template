        "article_content": "The King of UFOs\n\nA television show has claimed that King Charles piloted a UFO across the skies in Canada, in 1975. This shocking claim comes in an interview of an eyewitness included in. The eyewitness claimed to have seen the monarch at the helm of a spaceship in Canada. The witness, Dan Costello, said Charles III -- then the Prince of Wales -- was one of the three pilots steering a prototype UFO at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia.Costello said Charles was positioned nearby at HMS Endeavour serving as a helicopter pilot when he was summoned for a secret mission known as \u2018Project Serpico\u2019. The submersible vehicle he helmed apparently discharged a bluish ionic flame, referring to the electrically charged particle, that scorched the earth underneath it.But was it a UFO? Costello said he didn't think it was extraterrestrial but it might be technology developed by Nikolai Tesla.Costello said the craft had dual rotor blades like a helicopter but would also just sit and hover in the sky with the blades not on and no sound of propulsion just a crackle of electromagnetism.The movie-maker, Christopher Lee, however, told UK Metro that Costello's claims might be quite far-fetched. \"I\u2019ve literally interviewed five or six times for over 10 hours \u2013 his story has been consistent and the technical detail he has supplied has been astonishing \u2013 you only see about seven minutes of him in the film,\" Lee said.\"I also looked into the area where he claims it happened and there are large underwater caissons and the British Navy did have a presence here combined with Prince Charles being stationed as a helicopter pilot on HMS Endeavour \u2013 so it does seem possible.\"Lee said Charles had long had a keen interest in UFO and the documentary says Prince Philip was a \"stickler for alien sightings too\".\"I have been contacted by someone close to Charles that claims Charles had a UFO experience so I\u2019m sure he does believe there is something in the skies that we can\u2019t explain,\" Lee said."

These sightings continued for 17 days, prompting suspicions that Russian or Chinese agents might be involved.On January 6, 2024, a clue emerged when a Chinese student at the University of Minnesota, Fengyun Shi, was caught flying a drone near Langley. His drone, which had photographed Navy ships, was abandoned after getting stuck in a tree. Shi was arrested a week later as he prepared to board a flight to China and was charged with unlawfully photographing classified naval installations.While US officials have confirmed similar drone swarms near Edwards Air Force Base in Nevada, the Defence Department has yet to publicly identify those behind these apparent surveillance efforts."

We're seeing that you know, people are struggling,\u201d said Roman Khaves the co-founder of Rizz. \u201cWhenever people are stuck in the middle of a conversation or don't know how to open up, they don't have the confidence to have these dating conversations.\"\n\nDating app fatigue, along with the struggle to continue a conversation led Khaves to find the solution in the Rizz app.\n\n\u201cAI wing woman, wing man,' Khaves said. \"That's with you 24/7.

Rizz will scan it, and we'll use our magical ai that we have in the background, and it will give you a strategy on how to open up and follow up with suggestions.\"\n\nKhaves says the goal isn\u2019t to tell someone what to say but to get people on a first date fast.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are stuck and they're in this endless cycle, and these dating apps are swiping endlessly, and they never actually make it to the date,\u201d Khaves said.\n\nDivinity and Jose say if a tool like this was available for them, they wouldn\u2019t have used it.\n\n\u201cI understand how you would do it if you're trying to, you know, have the right first impression, because that's an important thing when meeting someone for the first time,\u201d Jose said.\n\nExperts like Ernesto Verdugo say AI is the future even when it comes to dating.\n\n\u201cPreviously it was based on algorithms,\" Verdago said. \"Right now, it's based on predictions, which is a lot more powerful.\"\n\nAs for Rizz, Khaves says this is only the beginning.\n\n\u201cThe goal for us is to be really the leading ai dating app for, you know, the modern century,\u201d Khaves said . \u201cWe're going to do even more cool, interesting things to help people with dating. The whole point is we want everybody to find love.\u201d\n\nAs more people download apps in search of love, Divinity and Jose hope their story can inspire others.\n\n\u201cMy hearts never felt honestly so full, like, with them in my life,\u201d Divinity said.\n\n\u201cSometimes it's just about being faithful and, you know, taking a risk,\u201d Jose said."

Iowa Educational Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired (IESBVI) staff were there to help the students experience inclusive access to the animals and exhibits.\n\nIESBVI staff taught the students how to use an app that audibly reads sign\u2019s and describes the animal\u2019s enclosure. IESBVI gave demonstrations on how white canes are used and the different types of white canes. There were also monocular and binocular optical telescopes that helped provide better access to low-visions students.\n\nAfter the demonstration students, families, and staff went on a tour of the zoo. Iowa Radio Reading Information Service (IRIS) provided live narration of the animals and exhibits during the tour.\n\nWinterset celebrates 54th annual Covered Bridge Festival\n\nSusan Rolinger, Director of Expanded Learning for IESBVI, says events like these fill her with hope and joy. These events give impaired individuals opportunities and experiences that they might normally miss out on.\n\n\u201cWe want people to see the work that we do and how independent these students are, how they can enjoy days like this with full access,\u201d said Rolinger.\n\nRolinger says that some students may not have need of these tools during their everyday life, causing them to have less knowledge of certain devices or systems. She hopes that by giving students the tools and teaching them to use them, they can utilize them later when the occasion arises.\n\nThis event comes just before White Cane Safety Day, recently changed to Blind Americans Equality Day, on October 15. The day recognizes the white cane as a symbol of safety, mobility, and independence for people who are blind, visually impaired, or deafblind.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Privee AI has emerged with the goal of filling this gap.\n\nThe founders of this app are committed to fulfilling the needs that they believe the developers of prominent apps on the current market have overlooked.\n\nAccording to Antonio Scapellato, Chief Executive Officer of Privee AI, the main motivation behind its launch comes from the desire to address the needs of users that are currently going unmet or even ignored.\n\n\"How to beat the industry giants? Just care more about the users, because clearly, most major players don't,\" said Antonio Scapellato. \"We've listened to the dissatisfaction of some users and decided to build something better ourselves, something that truly meets their needs and expectations.\"\n\nAntonio and his team at Privee AI have leveraged the power of cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies and created one of the largest collections of AI-generated characters. Beyond authentic AI avatars and cutting-edge graphics, the characters created by Privee AI have unique \"chatting\" capabilities, led by their user-centric approach.\n\n\"We believe users deserve exactly what they want. If they're asking for the best large language models and the most extensive chat memory available, we'll deliver that. If they're seeking absolute privacy for their data and complete confidentiality in their chats, we're fully committed to providing it,\" Antonio further stated.\n\nIn their effort to create AI chat with fictional characters that feel real, the team at Privee AI is working tirelessly on delivering the best experience to their users. By leveraging advanced technology, the company now aims to simplify usage while bringing its AI characters to life.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven though Privee AI already has over a thousand unique characters, users of this app are equipped with the tools to create their own, original ones.

This commitment allows users to explore their fantasies in a safe and secure environment.\"\n\nWhen pulled into the Story Teller's world, Privee AI's characters can be almost anything. From friends and lovers to protagonists and villains, Privee AI's advanced technology is uniquely designed to create that \"magic\" by enabling AI characters to fully embody their personalities as if they were real, living people.\n\nThe Privee AI chat was designed to be more than just a tool of communication between the AI engine and the user. It is meant to create visceral interactions that are almost indistinguishable from \"human\" interplay.\n\nSuperheroes, AI anime, fictional characters, vampires, werewolves, warriors, and wizards - they all have unique personalities, and express them through quirky social cues. Moreover, Privee AI's chatbot characters step into the shoes of \"actors\" when they interact with users.\n\nAll Privee AI's powerful features range from picture to audio generation to group chats: a special chat function that enables multiple characters to interact with each other and play with the user in a seamless flow.\n\nMore information about Privee AI can be found on the company's official website.\n\nContact Info:\n\nName: Antonio Scapellato\n\nEmail: antonio.scapellato@priveeai.com\n\nOrganization: Privee AI\n\nAddress: 800 N King Street, Suite 304 2416, Wilmington, DE 19801\n\nPhone: +18438432816\n\nWebsite: https://www.priveeai.com\n\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/225958"

The iconic gates were put in place in 1895 and have been replaced at least once after being taken without permission. Today, the gates are gone. They were moved to the Leicester Historical Society for safekeeping after several incidents of vandalism and graffiti.\n\nOver the years, the gates that welcome visitors have become a draw in itself. The Leicester Historical Commission is in discussion as to how to best put them back on public display while protecting them at the same time.\n\n\"We're going to complete the restoration of the carriage/summer house located at the Swan Tavern-Leicester Historical Museum by spring 2025 and when that is done, we will decide between one of two plans on where to place them on public display along with a history of the Quakers in Leicester,\" said Joe Lennerton of the Leicester Historical Commission.\n\nWhile most \"spooky\" places have a singular terrifying tale, a monster in the woods, a legendary curse, Spider Gates has all of the above and more, it seems.\n\nAn oak tree, known as the Hanging Tree, is said to be haunted by the ghost of someone who took their own life by hanging. Strange white ooze has been seen seeping from the ground and small stones with strange runes have been found just outside the walls of the cemetery.\n\nNearby, there is said to be a cave where a young woman was murdered decades ago. A river runs nearby and is said to actually be the river Styx, which leads to the underworld.\n\nApparently, another cemetery appears across the street and can only be seen once. And if you listen, visitors have heard a demonic creature roaming the woods.\n\nFinally, if one where to visit the gravestone of Marmaduke Earle at midnight and rest their head on it, legend has it, he will speak to whomever dares get that close.\n\nBut what's the real story? The cemetery is taken care of by a group of Quakers, called the Worcester Friends Meeting, who continue to use the land as a cemetery to this day.\n\n\"We just want the public to treat this cemetery the way one would treat the cemetery their own family members are buried in,\" Karen Sargent of the Worcester Friends Meeting said. \"I didn't grow up with the stories surrounding the cemetery and I've heard several, but like anything, it's like watching scary movies, some people just like to be scared.\"\n\nThere are a few rules for the cemetery. The land is closed from dusk until dawn and paranormal investigations are not permitted.\n\nThat doesn't stop people visiting, lured by the legends. April Kitchen is originally from Norwich, Connecticut, but spends her time traveling the country in her RV, visiting interesting places.\n\n\"I'm always looking for new places to go and experiences to be had,\" she said. \"I typically Google search 'things to do near me' and go from there. Since Halloween is coming up, I included 'spooky' as a keyword for a specific experience.\"\n\nKitchen visited the cemetery twice last month: once in the evening with her daughter and again the following day with her husband.\n\n\"I would definitely say the feel of the cemetery and surrounding area was spookier in the evening compared with midday,\" she said. \"Maybe it was because that time it was just my daughter and me alone, maybe it was the failing light. Lots of sounds in the woods. Both of us thought we saw another cemetery area down the path that leads to the river but didn't go down there. The next day we did walk the path and there was no second cemetery, only a path and the river. I later read some lore for Spider Gates that says you will see a second cemetery once and then never again. So, who knows, maybe that's what that was.\"\n\nThat's not all. Kitchen said she heard \"what sounded like a woman's voice by the river on the second day,\" adding it may have just been the water playing tricks.\n\nOutside of the potentially paranormal, Kitchen said walking through the cemetery, it was noticeably well cared for and it was the large sections of families buried together that caught her attention.\n\n\"You think about what their lives were like. Who they were, and the things they did. And that love of family led them to end up laid to rest together.\"\n\nThe first person buried was John Potter in 1740, one of the earliest Quakers to settle in the area. The most recent grave was filled about a month ago.\n\nSargent said members of the Worcester Friends Meeting and the Southwick family are buried within, adding members of the public must request to be buried at the cemetery.\n\nSeveral notable people are buried within, according to Lennerton. Pliny Earle built the first functioning carding machine in North America, while his son, Dr. Pliny Earle Jr., paid to restore the cemetery in the late 1800s.\n\n\"Also of note,\" Lennerton said. \"Admiral Ralph Earle, graduate of Annapolis and later chief of the bureau of naval ordnance.\" And finally, Leicester native Stephen Earle, the architect behind the Leicester Public Library and Bancroft Tower, Boynton Hall at WPI and the Union Congregational Church on Chestnut Street in Worcester.\n\nA special thank you to Anne for her suggestion of Friends Cemetery and the legends surrounding Spider Gates for this week's edition of Worcester County Wonders.\n\nT&G engagement editor Sarah Barnacle is getting to know Central Mass. by exploring some of the best places to go and things to do in Worcester County.

        "article_content": "Since the Nobel Prizes were created in 1901, just 24 women have received awards in the sciences. This year, that number stayed the same: All seven laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine were men.\n\nSome scientists have expressed frustration about the lack of women among this year\u2019s awardees, particularly the omission of two women who contributed to the work honored for the prize in physiology or medicine. Experts who study gender bias in the sciences say the Nobel\u2019s gender gap reflects the larger barriers to success faced by women in science \u2014 and that science is poorer for it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe men who received this year\u2019s prizes are \u201csuperstars,\u201d said Liselotte Jauffred, a physicist at the Niels Bohr Institute who has studied gender bias in the Nobels. But \u201cwhat are the mechanisms that make it easier for men to enter that pool of superstar scientists that could even be nominated for a Nobel Prize?\u201d\n\nCertain fields, like biology, chemistry and social sciences are reaching gender parity in undergraduate and graduate degrees. But representation falls further up the academic ladder \u2014 a problem known as the leaky pipeline. Some women are pushed out of science altogether because of experiences of sexism. Those who persist are less often promoted to senior professorships, and even fewer become chief physicians, department heads, or journal editors.\n\nEven once in academia, women are not given tenure as often as men. They are not listed as the key author on as many papers, are cited less often than male colleagues, and receive fewer prestigious awards overall.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFiguring out whether the Nobels reflect even more bias than academia as a whole was \u201cnot easy\u201d Jauffred said. Researchers had to account for the lag between when a discovery is made and when it is recognized, and for the lower representation of women in science over the years. But even when accounting for those factors, she and her colleagues found in a 2019 study that the likelihood that bias against women played a role in the decision of who gets awards was around 96%.\n\nThis year\u2019s Nobel for physiology or medicine, which was awarded to Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros for the discovery of microRNA, has attracted particular scrutiny with regard to gender bias. Many outside observers commented on the fact that Rosalind Lee, Ambros\u2019 wife and long-time collaborator, was not recognized for the discovery despite being a first author on one of the studies cited by the committee. To some, the story seemed to write itself \u2014 another Rosalind overlooked by the committee, much like Rosalind Franklin, whose contributions to the discovery of DNA\u2019s double helix were not initially recognized.\n\nThere are, however, reasons beyond sexism that can lead collaborators like Lee to get overlooked. The Nobel committee limits awards to three people, which some scientists have pointed out is an antiquated way to reward discoveries that are increasingly part of large collaborations.\n\n\u201cAny project of any complexity rolls out over years with many contributors,\u201d said Bruce Wightman, a biologist at Muhlenberg College who was in Ruvkun\u2019s lab and worked on an aspect of the discovery of microRNA. \u201cScience takes a village.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for UMass Chan Medical School said Lee and Ambros are \u201ccelebrating the Nobel Prize and view it as a recognition of the team\u2019s collaborative work.\u201d\n\nThe push to reduce gender bias in Nobel Prizes\n\nThat said, how credit is distributed to scientists that are part of a large collaboration may also be the product of bias. One study found that women who co-authored papers were less likely to receive tenure compared to those who published papers alone. This kind of collaboration didn\u2019t have any effect on men\u2019s ability to get tenure. Another found that women tended to receive authorship on papers or patents to which they had contributed less often than male colleagues.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Nobels tend to \u201crecognize people who were in a position of power and authority, instead of the people who actually made a discovery or had an idea or proved it experimentally,\u201d said Pnina Abir-Am, a historian of science at Brandeis University, who has studied collaborative couples in science as well as documented the women who were not recognized for the Nobel prize for RNA splicing.\n\nNewsletter Weekdays Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Sign Up Your data will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. You may opt out of receiving STAT communications at any time.\n\nThe Nobel committee is often \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d in who it gives awards to, Abir-Am said, favoring those who are heads of the lab where the research was conducted as well as those who have trained with other Nobel laureates. That means lower chances of receiving the prize for women, racial minorities, and more junior scientists who have made breakthrough discoveries but are less likely to be in positions of power.\n\nNobel winners also tend to come from socioeconomically privileged backgrounds, according to Paul Novosad, an economist at Dartmouth College who studies access to opportunity and upward mobility. Novosad and his colleagues published a white paper this week finding that on average, laureates came from households with fathers in the 87th percentile of income in their country. Around half were in the top 5% by income.\n\nFemale laureates tended to be from even more elite families, which the authors write may be because the higher socioeconomic status helps them overcome some of the gendered obstacles in academia. But \u201cit means that elite women in the sciences are drawn from an even smaller socioeconomic pool than men, implying substantial misallocation,\u201d they write in the paper.\n\n\u201cIf children who are brilliant but poor fail to make it into the sciences, then all of humanity loses out on their potential discoveries,\u201d said Novosad.\n\nThings may be changing. The analysis found that the average socioeconomic status of laureates is creeping downward, which could signal a slow democratization of the sciences. \u201cThis kind of research is really important for the same reasons that we would like to see less elite demographics represented in various top positions,\u201d said Novosad. \u201cUnfortunately there is still a surprising amount of work to do just to convince men in senior scientific positions that these barriers exist at all.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne change that may make recognition more fair going forward is the growing practice of papers delineating what each author has contributed to a paper. \u201cJournals require scientists to say who contributed to conception and who contributed to experiments,\u201d Abir-Am said. This creates less ambiguity around who directly contributed to discoveries that are being honored by awards \u2014 as opposed to assuming lab heads or senior authors did the lion\u2019s share of the work. \u201cI don\u2019t care who is a director and who is a junior [researcher], I want to know who did what.\u201d\n\nThe organizations that select Nobel laureates have taken steps to address the laureates\u2019 lack of diversity in recent years. In 2019, Nobel committees began asking nominators to consider gender and ethnicity to encourage a wider range of diversity in nominees. And since scientists have to be invited to contribute nominations, \u201c[w]e are extending invitations to an increasing number of individuals from regions beyond traditional academic research hubs in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan,\u201d Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, told Nature this week. \u201cMoreover, we\u2019re actively identifying more women and younger scientists as nominators.\u201d\n\nJauffred has also seen improvement. She was motivated to write her paper on gender bias in the Nobels after Donna Strickland in 2018 became the first woman to win the Nobel in physics in 55 years. Since 2018, two more women have also won the Nobel in physics. Still, progress is slow.\n\n\u201cThe demography of fields has been changing for a long time, but it\u2019s not yet reflected in Nobel Prizes,\u201d Jauffred said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t see that diversity represented in the Nobel Prizes, of course we ask ourselves questions. Why does it have to be like that?\u201d\n\nMegan Molteni contributed reporting."

        "article_content": "Back when X was Twitter and not the mess it is today, there were vibrant and often fiery debates. One such recurring debate was whether Chemistry Nobel Prizes were even chemistry, or whether chemistry had surrendered to biology.\n\nOn one side were the physical, organic, and inorganic chemists, who often saw themselves as the gatekeepers of the discipline. On the other, the renegades: biochemists, chemical biologists, and other hybrids like us who blurred the lines. We were the folks who, when asked by chemists, loved to talk about biology, and when asked by biologists, we\u2019d switch to chemistry.\n\nFast forward to this year\u2019s Nobel Prize announcements, and the debate has resurfaced.\n\nIn a piece for this newspaper, I wrote about the AI-driven prediction of protein structures that won half of the chemistry Nobel three years ago. That\u2019s a short span of time from discovery to prize, especially when it can take decades for a discovery to be recognised by the Nobel committee.\n\nOne-half of this year\u2019s chemistry award went to David Baker from the University of Washington in the US for developing computational tools that let us design proteins with novel shapes and functions. Again, this is a monumental discovery since proteins are the machines that make life possible. Baker\u2019s discovery opens up the world of proteins from scratch, well almost. As Carl Sagan once said, \u201cIf you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.\u201d\n\nBut the questions always linger about two of the most revered prizes. What is physics? What is chemistry? And, does it even matter?\n\nWell, yes and no. What you study often delineates your area of expertise. This was painfully obvious during the Covid-19 pandemic. Epidemiologists waded into virology and vice versa, often leading to wild extrapolations and incorrect conclusions. Public health experts extended their reach into areas outside their expertise such as economic policy (and vice versa), leaving the public confused and uncertain about who to trust. Even some Nobel laureates added to the noise, speaking authoritatively on topics where their knowledge was shaky at best.\n\nAs for the careers of the scientists themselves, discipline distinctions determine funding decisions, faculty positions, and public recognition. Researchers publish in scientific journals that align with their formal discipline and attend conferences where they rub shoulders with others in their field.\n\nAs someone who spent over 15 years as a biologist working at the world\u2019s largest chemical society, I know a thing or two about this. My team and I conceptualised and helped to create scientific journals in blurry fields like synthetic biology, infectious disease drug discovery, and chemical neuroscience, often drawing the ire of online traditionalists who thought we were pushing boundaries too far.\n\nWhich brings us back to the Nobel Prizes. They\u2019re bending and twisting to stay relevant.\n\nAs Geoffrey Hinton, one of this year\u2019s Physics Nobel recipients pointed out in an interview with The New York Times, the actual idea driving much of AI today, backpropagation, isn\u2019t related to the physics concept that helped him win the prize.\n\nBackpropagation, a method used to train neural networks, revolutionised AI by allowing models to learn from their mistakes and improve iteratively. It\u2019s been crucial to developing the AI systems we rely on today. Hinton himself acknowledged that the Boltzmann machine, the physics-based model that earned him the Nobel, was more like an enzyme in that it helped overcome an initial hurdle, but once we figured out how to train neural networks using backpropagation, it was no longer needed.\n\nThere was just one problem. There was no way for the Nobel committee to consider backpropagation in physics, chemistry, or any of their awarded disciplines.\n\nAnd this raises a larger issue. While there are other prestigious awards like the Turing Award, often dubbed the \"Nobel Prize of Computer Science,\" and the Fields Medal in mathematics, none of them have the same cultural weight as the Nobel Prize. The Nobel carries an aura all its own, both in the public eye and within professional circles.\n\nHinton, for example, notes that his Nobel win will make people take his warnings about the dangers of AI more seriously. The public perception of the Nobel lends gravitas that no other prize can match.\n\nSo, do the Nobel Prizes matter? Yes, they do, because they reward major advances and confer broader legitimacy. But most researchers who work on the cutting edge will never win one. As we face increasingly complex challenges like climate change, pandemics, and AI, we need to recognise that scientific fields that defy easy categorisation are more important than they were when Alfred Nobel conceived these awards.\n\nAnirban Mahapatra is a scientist and author, most recently of the popular science book, When The Drugs Don\u2019t Work: The Hidden Pandemic That Could End Medicine. The views expressed are personal."

According to UiPath, agentic AI is a combination of different AI techniques, models and approaches to create autonomous agents that analyse data, set goals and take action with minimal human supervision and near-human cognition and continuous learning. \u201cAgentic AI achieves this level of cognition by employing a combination of advanced AI techniques, including large language models (LLMs), machine learning algorithms, deep learning and reinforcement learning. For example, LLMs, like those that power OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Meta Llama, are employed to allow autonomous systems to understand and respond to natural language commands. Machine learning algorithms enable these systems to analyse data and identify patterns. Reinforcement learning techniques allow them to learn from their actions and improve their decision-making over time,\u201d notes UiPath, on its about pages. Forward is taking place at the MGM Grand Las Vegas Oct. 21-24, 2024. The event\u2019s theme \u201cTransform with AI\u201d aims to underscore the importance of AI in both business strategy and technological performance. This year, Forward is is complemented this year by TechEd, a curated agenda designed for the leaders and practitioners charged with turning the vision for AI-powered automation into real-world impact. Forward + TechEd feature more than 60 sessions featuring over 200 expert speakers, attendees can explore the ways enterprise automation and AI are transforming business processes and industry use cases. The event features presentations by automation experts from organisations such as Amgen, Cox Enterprises, Johnson Controls, Paychex, Prudential Financial, USI Insurance Services and Whirlpool Corporation, among others."
