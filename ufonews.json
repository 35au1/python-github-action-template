            "article_content": "The internet has been left divided over an 'egg-shaped craft' recorded during a UAP retrieval operation after the video was aired on TV for the first time.\n\nNewsNation aired the footage that 'clearly showed' the object dangling in a sling from a helicopter on Saturday night.\n\nThe alleged craft was about 20ft long and resembled the UAP encountered by the Navy off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects, NewsNation reported.\n\nIt was pointed out in the video that the object had no markings, being 'perfectly smooth', and no 'visible' means of propulsion or way to look inside.\n\nAfter the segment aired, Redditors had mixed opinions on the footage's veracity, although many were impressed by what they saw.\n\n'This is pretty cool. I don\u2019t know what you guys were expecting of a nighttime retrieval. This is actually more clear than I thought it would be. It helps to lower expectations,' one wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'I had a feeling that the video would be somewhat ambiguous. I'm not sure this is gonna move the needle without more substantiating evidence. I think it's great, personally, but this isn't gonna convince Joe Taxpayer.'\n\n'Probably is real. But you aren\u2019t going to convince people with this. To claim this is any different from any other sketchy video already seen (outside the gimbal & go fast) is a stretch & hardly going to make anybody new sit up & take notice. Too bad,' another wrote.\n\nNewsNation aired the footage which 'clearly showed' the object dangling in a sling from a helicopter\n\nThe outlet was told the craft was about 20ft long. It's said to resemble the UAP encountered by the Navy off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects\n\nHowever, other users were much less convinced.\n\n'Well, the video quality is better than I expected, I'll give them that. The object itself? With no frame of reference to judge size, it could be an actual chicken egg as far as I can tell,' one Redditor wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'This video could not have been cheap to make with the cost of eggs these days!'\n\n'No reference to size, this could literally be a chicken egg on a string, with helicopter noises edited in,' a third added.\n\n'This shows nothing. This is not earth shattering, redefining man kind evidence they were promising,' another wrote.\n\nA fifth commented: 'I knew the footage was not going to be good. But what exactly am I looking at here? An egg on the end of a fishing rod?'\n\nOther users pointed out some potential issues with the credibility of the footage.\n\n'What kind of terrain is this supposed to be on? Something about the scaling and shadow feels off,' one questioned.\n\n'Well, the video quality is better than I expected, I'll give them that. The object itself? With no frame of reference to judge size, it could be an actual chicken egg as far as I can tell,' one user wrote\n\nAnother eagle-eyed user said: 'If this was in the desert how is the helicopter not blowing up dust and sand like crazy.'\n\n'So, like, wouldn't they drop off the egg thing on a truck or something or a base? Why are they dropping it off on the ground of what appears an empty desert field?' another wrote.\n\n'No prop wash? I could fake this in my house right now in an hour,' a Redditor added.\n\nAnother user replied by pointing out the lack of sway in the rope.\n\n'So, they retrieved and filmed just an egg-shaped thing. It wasn't flying, it wasn't doing anything. What a load of utter nonsense this is,' one user said.\n\nThe video, which was kept in the dark until its bombshell release, is the latest video footage that has made the rounds online in recent weeks seemingly depicting a UFO.\n\nWidespread interest and coverage of the subject surged after drones were seen flying across New Jersey last month.\n\nOffering a solution to the mystery, Tucker Carlson made a shocking claim that the mysterious drones were controlled by a Chinese mothership satellite.\n\nTucker Carlson discussed the mysterious drones on his show this week, saying he was told the objects were controlled by China\n\nThe White House repeatedly stated that the drone sightings are not a foreign adversary, pose no threat and are not part of a US military operation\n\nThe first sightings appeared over the Picatinny Arsenal in Rockaway and President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster in November, followed by thousands more in the skies.\n\nWhile the US government was quick to dismiss claims they were foreign adversaries, Carlson claimed he was told otherwise.\n\nHe said, 'an intel person' told him that the drones 'were in fact Chinese,' explaining the US government took down a Chinese satellite 'that was a command and control satellite for these drones.'\n\nCarlson appeared to be hinting at a Beijing-operated satellite known as GaoJing 1-02 which fell from space on December 21.\n\nAstronomers tracking such devices confirmed the Chinese satellite re-entered Earth's atmosphere above New Orleans and headed north towards Mississippi, Arkansas and Missouri before burning up in the atmosphere.\n\nBut Carlson claimed it was 'taken down by the US government.'\n\nHe made the claims while speaking with independent journalist Michael Shellenberger, who heard a similar explanation for the drones.\n\n'Somebody told me that that the military got one of the orbs, opened it up and it was Chinese,' Shellenberger said.\n\nThe White House repeatedly stated that the drone sightings - which coincidentally began on November 18 - are not a foreign adversary, pose no threat and are not part of a US military operation.\n\nBut Carlson said his inside source told him that 'the belief was the Chinese government was sending the following message, 'We're moving on Taiwan.''"

The Oscar-winning director famously helmed \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d (1977), \u201cE.T.\u201d (1982) and \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d (2005), which also filmed in New Jersey.\n\nSpielberg, 78, spent some of his youngest years as a child living in New Jersey with his family, as depicted in his film \u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d (2022). He most recently filmed in Jersey, largely in Paterson, for his take on \u201cWest Side Story\u201d (2021) starring Clifton\u2019s Rachel Zegler.\n\nThe Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet-Bob Dylan movie \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d directed by James Mangold, also filmed in Cape May this past spring.\n\nHere are the details for the casting call:\n\nThe Spielberg production, code name \u201cNon-View,\u201d needs extras to play car drivers and train station passengers. Applicants must be at least 18, no previous acting experience necessary.\n\nFilming will tentatively take place Monday, March 10 through Friday, March 14 in Cape May. The base pay rate is $216 per day (eight hours) and the car allowance is $37.50.\n\nTo be considered for the film, send Grant Wilfley Casting an email \u2014 address nj@gwcnyc.com. Use the subject line \u201cNon-View Cape May Locals\u201d and include this information:\n\nYour name, pronouns, phone number, whether or not you are a SAG-AFTRA member, what dates you are available during the filming window, whether or not you have visible tattoos and whether or not you are local to Cape May. Include current non-professional photos of yourself, both close-up and full-body. If you own a car that you can use in the film, also send the color, year, make and model and a photo of the car."

            "article_content": "Unlike most of the PC gaming world, my ears didn\u2019t perk up when Nvidia announced DLSS Multi-Frame Generation alongside its RTX 50-series GPUs. Although the cards themselves look destined for a slot or two among the best graphics cards, the new DLSS 4 and its Multi-Frame Generation feature that\u2019s exclusive to Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards didn\u2019t stand out. To me, at least.\n\nThat\u2019s because I\u2019ve been using an app called Lossless Scaling for close to a year now, which spent most of the past 12 months laying the groundwork for multi-frame generation. I\u2019ve written about Lossless Scaling too many times to count, but it\u2019s high time to revisit the app once again. Not only is DLSS 4 on the way to show everyone what multi-frame generation is capable of, Lossless Scaling just received the biggest update it\u2019s seen in months.\n\nIt\u2019s really, really good\n\nJacob Roach / Digital Trends\n\nLet me catch you up to speed if you haven\u2019t heard of Lossless Scaling. It\u2019s an upscaling and frame generation utility that\u2019s $7 on Steam. It works with any graphics card, and with any game, and that\u2019s because the frame generation happens at the display step. Unlike DLSS or AMD\u2019s FSR 3, it doesn\u2019t mess with anything in the game engine. That means you can use it with online games and titles that have a frame rate cap, such as Elden Ring.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLossless Scaling doesn\u2019t tap into any AI hardware on your graphics card, but it\u2019s a bit smarter than standard frame interpolation. It has three algorithms available, all of which have been developed using machine learning. And LSFG 3, the latest algorithm, was just released. It offers standard frame generation, as well as triple and quadruple settings, just like DLSS 4. You can even set your own custom frame generation factor, up to 20X. I wouldn\u2019t recommend that, though.\n\nAssuming you have a decent base frame rate, the 4X frame generation works a treat. With the RTX 4080, for example, I was getting around 50 frames per second (fps) at 4K with the highest graphics preset in Marvel Rivals. Tick on Lossless Scaling, and my frame rate jumped to between 170 fps and 180 fps. That\u2019s without any upscaling or other tricks. And despite how competitive Marvel Rivals is, I didn\u2019t feel like I was dragging my mouse through mud.\n\nThe latest LSFG 3 algorithm works really well with multi-frame generation, as well. Previously, I tried out the feature in Elden Ring and found too many visual artifacts to stomach. With the new model, any visual artifacts that were present weren\u2019t enough to distract me. Even my cursor was fine, which is an area where I would expect to see major issues with a tool like Lossless Scaling.\n\nIn addition, Lossless Scaling has a feature that even pushes beyond what Nvidia offers with DLSS. Below the frame generation section, you\u2019ll find a resolution slider. This reduces the resolution of frames that are passed through the frame generation algorithm in order to reduce latency and improve overall performance. You still see everything at your monitor\u2019s native resolution, but the scale factor helps tremendously in improving performance.\n\nSome downsides\n\nI just gushed about Lossless Scaling, and for good reason. It\u2019s an app I unironically use in nearly every PC game I play. I\u2019ve gotten so much use out of it that I rarely even think about the price tag \u2014 Steam has tracked hundreds of hours of usage time in the app, which is pretty good for only $7. It\u2019s not perfect, though, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same as DLSS 4. It\u2019s just a good compromise.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, your base frame rate. Like any frame generation feature, Lossless Scaling uses frame interpolation. It renders two frames, compares them, and then the algorithm generates a frame to go in between based on the difference between the two rendered ones. This creates additional latency, as your GPU needs to always have a frame buffered before displaying anything to you. And, the latency is compounded if you have a low base frame rate.\n\nThe lower your frame rate, the longer it takes for each frame to be rendered, so there\u2019s far more latency when adding frame generation into the mix. For Lossless Scaling, I recommend at least an average frame rate of 40 fps before engaging frame generation, and ideally close to 60 fps. That way, you\u2019ll still get good responsiveness and a smooth visual experience. In fairness to Lossless Scaling, this is an issue with all frame generation features, and likely something DLSS 4 will struggle with, too.\n\nNvidia\n\nCompared to DLSS 4, the main issue is quality. I haven\u2019t extensively tested DLSS 4 yet. However, it runs within the rendering pipeline, and it has access to data from the game engine like motion vectors. There are a couple of reasons why that gives DLSS 4 an advantage. First, HUD elements. Static elements on your screen like your HUD or crosshair actually aren\u2019t part of the main rendering process \u2014 they\u2019re applied after the fact, and the 3D world is still rendered underneath.\n\nDLSS 4 is able to essentially mask out those elements so there aren\u2019t visual artifacts on them. Lossless Scaling, being at the display stage, sees those elements and isn\u2019t able to mask them out.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, Lossless Scaling doesn\u2019t always get the frame interpolation perfect. Motion vectors from the game engine describe how objects are moving throughout a scene, so DLSS 4 can better perform the frame interpolation it needs to. That sometimes means you\u2019ll see visual artifacts with Lossless Scaling that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t see with DLSS 4.\n\nThose are fairly minor complaints in the grand scheme. Nvidia\u2019s upcoming RTX 50-series GPUs may be impressive \u2014 I\u2019ll have to wait to test them \u2014 but tools like Lossless Scaling are breaking the price dynamic. If you otherwise have a GPU you\u2019re happy with the performance with, give Lossless Scaling a shot. After all, a $7 app is a heck of a lot better than spending $2,000 on a new graphics card."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been referred to as a generational opportunity by leadership at some of the top tech companies in the world. While some of the benefits are already beginning to be felt, AI still looks to be in the early stages of its development as a revolutionary technology.\n\nGiven that there is still a long way to go in AI's development, there is also seemingly plenty of opportunity left for companies to benefit and potentially help make investors who get in early into millionaires. Let's look at three stocks across AI infrastructure, cloud computing, and software that could push a millionaire-making portfolio to its goal over the long haul.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter!

Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest AI winners thus far, but that doesn't preclude it from continuing to be a big winner. Computing power is paramount for training large language models (LLMs) and running inference needed for AI's development and operations. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have proven to be one of the best chips to accomplish these tasks. One of two big GPU designers, Nvidia has been able to take a dominant market share of nearly 90% in the space with the help of its CUDA software platform, which makes it much easier to program GPUs for various AI tasks.\n\nAs such, Nvidia's GPUs have become the backbone of AI data center infrastructure, which continues to grow at a rapid pace. As companies look to train more sophisticated LLMs, they need exponentially more computing power. Some of the latest versions of AI models require 10 times as many GPUs as their prior versions in order to accomplish their computationally intensive tasks. There are indications that there could be LLMs requiring 1 million AI chip clusters in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, AI infrastructure remains robust, with Nvidia's largest customer Microsoft recently announcing it would spend an astonishing $80 billion building out data centers in 2025. Other large tech companies have also indicated that they plan to increase their AI-related spending this year.\n\nWith no end currently in sight for AI infrastructure spending, Nvidia continues to look like a long-term winner. Meanwhile, the stock is attractively priced with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of below 30 and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) under 1, which generally indicates a stock is undervalued.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is hoping to be an AI winner in several areas. The company has already seen strong growth in its cloud computing unit, Google Cloud, which saw its revenue jump 35% last quarter, as it helps customers build out their own AI models and applications. Meanwhile, the high-fixed-cost business has grown to a point where it is now profitable. As a result, segment income surged from $266 million in the year-ago quarter to $1.95 billion in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nWithin the data center segment of its business, Alphabet has also designed its own custom AI chips with the help of Broadcom. By using these custom tensor processing units (TPUs) in combination with GPUs, Alphabet is improving AI inference processing times and lowering costs for its users and clients. That could help give the segment even more operating leverage.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet has a nice opportunity with AI search and its Gemini AI assistant app. The company historically has only served ads on about 20% of its searches, so eventually monetizing its AI Overviews and Gemini app results would be a nice future opportunity. The company has also taken the lead in multimodal AI, with things such as text-to-video generation and visual search.\n\nThe company is also a leader in some other AI-adjacent emerging technologies including quantum computing and autonomous driving. The stock, meanwhile, is attractively valued, trading at a forward P/E of 19 times.\n\nArtist rendering of robotic AI.\n\nImage source: Getty Images\n\n3. Salesforce\n\nWhile AI infrastructure and cloud computing companies have seen the biggest revenue growth, agentic AI could be the next big wave. The AI getting the most attention at the moment has been generative AI, where AI can produce images, sound, or text in response to a user query. Agentic AI takes that a step further -- AI agents can go out and autonomously perform tasks within given parameters with little human supervision.\n\nSalesforce (NYSE: CRM) is looking to be at the forefront of agentic AI with its new Agentforce solution. The company already has a large customer base with its customer relationship management (CRM) software platform, and it will look to upsell these customers to its new AI agents. The company will have a number of out-of-the-box agents that can perform tasks in such areas as customer service, sales and marketing, and recruiting, while they will also be customizable through its no-code and low-code tools.\n\nReleased only in October, Agentforce has grown quickly, with the company saying it had more than 1,000 deals in place in mid-December. It projects to have 1 billion agents in force in fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026). Agentforce is a consumption product that costs $2 per conversation, so the more useful customers find its agents, the more upside it has.\n\nSalesforce currently trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 7.4 times fiscal 2026 analyst estimates, which is very reasonable given the opportunity in front of it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $843,960!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

            "article_content": "Those who sense the pull of the paranormal might once again be drawn to the Crescent Hotel and Spa in Eureka Springs -- renowned as \"America's Most Haunted Hotel.\" It beckons to them through the 14th annual Eureka Springs Paranormal (ESP) Weekends, scheduled for the last two weekends of January, where guests get a 48-hour immersion into the spooky and unexplainable.\n\nVisitors get a full weekend venture that includes guided ghost hunts, hands-on investigations, seminars and unique behind-the-scenes access to the historic hotel's most active paranormal hotspots. Discounted accommodation prices beginning at $149 per night allow you to remain where the paranormal activity occurs throughout ESP.\n\nBuilt in 1886, the Crescent Hotel has a colorful and, at times, frightening past. From its days as a Victorian health spa to its notoriety under Norman Baker, who converted the hotel into a hospital promising miraculous cancer treatments, the hotel has been the setting for successes, tragedies and stories that continue to captivate.\n\nLarry Flaxman, a paranormal theorist, best-selling novelist in the field and the Crescent Hotel's resident paranormal investigator who is speaking at ESP, believes the Crescent's history adds to its continued spiritual presence.\n\n\"The rich history of the Crescent Hotel, including the unscrupulous acts of Norman Baker and the physical, emotional, and mental pain of his cancer patients who occupied the Crescent during its time as a hospital, has left an indelible mark,\" Flaxman said in a 2021 Crescent blog post. \"Hauntings are common in locations where there has been extreme trauma and tragedy, and the long history of tragedies at this property has lent itself to producing an environment highly conducive for paranormal activity and making the Crescent Hotel America's Most Haunted Hotel.\"\n\nAn ESP Weekend schedule offers a range of events geared for both experienced investigators and interested novices. The Crescent's very own tour guides and prominent specialists such as Flaxman and Dave Harkins, founder of the Ozarks Paranormal Society, will lead participants through seminars, talks and extended overnight investigations.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing for me is being able to educate folks about the possibilities, the scientific probabilities of the continuity of life,\" Flaxman said in an over-the-phone interview. \"There's a demonstration that I'll be doing on Saturday that sort of melds quantum mechanics and spirit communication into one.\"\n\nJason 'Iakona' Colobong of the podcast Paranormal Patrol, based in Kansas City, reflects on his own transforming experience at last year's ESP Weekend.\n\nColobong said ESP Weekend 2024 was his team's first foray into official paranormal investigating. They wanted to attend a public event hosted by experienced investigators so they could quietly sit back and see how things were done.\n\n\"Having our first formal investigation at the Crescent set the bar too high,\" Colobong said. \"Our first night at ESP 2024 was so filled with incidents and possible evidence that, when we go to other places, we find ourselves with far less, if any, evidence.\"\n\nThey had an unforgettable encounter in Norman Baker's bedroom, Colobong recounted, recalling how a mist-like figure climbed the stairs in time with the sound of footsteps. One of the other members of Paranormal Patrol, Jennifer Kohl, saw the mist-like figure while Colobong and Frank Pflumm were setting up the cameras and heard the footsteps themselves. When they turned around to see who it was, there was nothing there, but Colobong said Kohl asked over and over if they saw it. The two members didn't and unfortunately did not have the camera recording when it happened. All three disappointed, but still Colobong said the encounter has been one of the highlights of their career so far.\n\nThe real difference between the Crescent's paranormal event and others that the Paranormal Patrol has attended, Colobong said, comes in the overall experience. At the Crescent, visitors have guides and professionals who are all familiar with the common equipment used in the investigations. You don't have to have a large set of skills or even equipment for ESP weekend because the staff is there to help and provide you with what you need, he said.\n\n\"This is one of the best ways to get yourself exposed to the paranormal world without risk or significant cost,\" Colobong said. Paranormal Patrol plans to return to this year's ESP Weekend.\n\nSo the question is: Are you ready to hunt or ready to learn? Whether you're a believer, skeptic, or simply curious, the ESP Weekends allow you to delve into the Crescent Hotel and Spa's historic mysteries.\n\n-\n\nFAQ\n\n14th annual Eureka Springs Paranormal Weekends\n\nWHEN -- Jan. 24-26 and Jan. 31-Feb. 2.

            "article_content": "In a groundbreaking discovery that sounds like science fiction but is absolutely real, researchers have found that your eyes contain hidden signals that could predict your risk of having a stroke. This revolutionary finding isn\u2019t just another medical study, it\u2019s a potential game-changer in how we approach stroke prevention and early detection.\n\nThe incredible science behind retinal fingerprints\n\nScientists have identified 29 unique vascular indicators in your retina that serve as warning signs for stroke risk. These tiny blood vessels in your eyes create patterns as unique as your fingerprints, and their condition can reveal crucial information about your overall health. Within these indicators, 17 are density-related markers that can increase your stroke risk by up to 19% when altered. These changes are like tiny red flags waving in your eyes, signaling potential danger before other symptoms appear. The remaining indicators focus on the size and twistedness of blood vessels, with changes potentially raising stroke risk by nearly 20%. Think of these vessels as tiny roads in your eyes, their condition reflecting the health of your entire cardiovascular system.\n\nWhy this discovery is absolutely mind-blowing\n\nTraditional stroke risk assessments often involve invasive procedures and expensive tests. But this new method requires nothing more than a specialized photograph of your eye. The implications are enormous, especially for communities where access to advanced medical testing is limited or cost-prohibitive.\n\nThe beauty of this breakthrough lies in its simplicity. During a routine eye exam, doctors can capture detailed images of your retina and analyze them for these crucial indicators. It\u2019s painless, quick, and could potentially save countless lives through early detection.\n\nThe fascinating connection between your eyes and brain\n\nYour retina isn\u2019t just a window to your soul, it\u2019s actually an extension of your brain. Every tiny blood vessel in your eye tells a story about the health of your brain\u2019s blood vessels. This connection explains why changes in your retinal vasculature can predict stroke risk with remarkable accuracy.\n\nWhat makes this discovery revolutionary\n\nThe research team analyzed data from over 45,000 participants. This massive study revealed that retinal analysis combined with basic demographic information could predict stroke risk as accurately as traditional methods.\n\nWhat\u2019s truly remarkable is how this technology could transform preventive healthcare. Imagine walking into your local eye clinic and getting a comprehensive stroke risk assessment during your regular eye exam. This isn\u2019t just convenient, it\u2019s revolutionary for global health care accessibility.\n\nThe global impact of this breakthrough\n\nThis discovery could dramatically change how we approach stroke prevention worldwide. In regions where advanced medical facilities are scarce, a simple eye scan could become a lifesaving tool. The technology could help identify at-risk individuals years before they might experience a stroke, allowing for early intervention and prevention strategies.\n\nHealthcare providers are particularly excited about implementing this technology in primary care settings. It could become as routine as checking blood pressure, but with the potential to reveal much more detailed information about cardiovascular health.\n\nWhat this means for the future of healthcare\n\nThe implications extend far beyond stroke prediction. Researchers believe similar retinal analysis could help predict other conditions like heart disease and dementia. This opens up endless possibilities for early detection and prevention of various diseases through simple eye examinations.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, we might see artificial intelligence systems analyzing these retinal images in real-time, providing instant risk assessments and recommendations. This could revolutionize how we approach preventive healthcare, making it more accessible and effective than ever before.\n\nThe discovery of retinal vascular fingerprints as predictors of stroke risk isn\u2019t just a scientific breakthrough, it\u2019s a glimpse into the future of medicine. It shows us that sometimes the most powerful diagnostic tools are hidden in plain sight, waiting to be understood and utilized. As this technology develops and becomes more widely available, it could transform how we approach disease prevention and ultimately save countless lives through early detection and intervention."

            "article_content": "By Chloe Mari A. Hufana, Reporter\n\nA STRICTER monitoring and enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with labor standards is needed amid a \u201cdim\u201d employment outlook, particularly in the country\u2019s service and agriculture sectors, a labor leader said.\n\nA recent International Labour Organization (ILO) report on insufficient global employment growth mirrors the situation in the Philippines, where persistent decent work deficits in the service and agriculture sectors are attributed by the Federation of Free Workers (FFW) to rampant contractualization, low wages, and unsafe working conditions.\n\n\u201cThe outlook remains dim, particularly when considered alongside the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) recent report. It estimates that 14% of the workforce \u2014 around 5 million Filipino workers \u2014 are at risk of displacement this year due to artificial intelligence (AI) and climate change,\u201d FFW President Jose Sonny G. Matula told BusinessWorld in a Viber message over the weekend.\n\nThe ILO\u2019s World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2025, released last week, found employment growth globally remained \u201ctoo weak\u201d to significantly impact lingering decent work deficits.\n\nWhile employment growth remains steady, various factors are testing the resilience of labor markets worldwide, it added.\n\n\u201cThe lack of faster global productivity growth is partly linked to the failure of structural change to move people out of agriculture into manufacturing and services,\u201d it noted.\n\n\u201cGiven the poor working conditions in much of farming outside advanced economies, this also means that working poverty and informality have not benefited from people moving out of agriculture to better-paying jobs in industry and services,\u201d it added.\n\nIndividuals in informal employment, particularly in agriculture and other sectors like wholesale and retail trade, often face irregular income and lack access to social protection, it added.\n\n\u201cIn this context, the vigorous exercise of the Department of Labor and Employment\u2019s (DoLE) inspection and visitorial powers under the Labor Code is essential,\u201d Mr. Matula said.\n\n\u201cStrengthened monitoring and enforcement mechanisms will ensure that employers comply with labor standards, while the Employment Plan should adapt to rapidly changing labor market dynamics, including those influenced by technology and climate change,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 2024, global employment grew alongside the expanding labor force, maintaining the global unemployment rate at a steady 5%, consistent with the level recorded in 2023, the ILO noted.\n\nHowever, this growth remains insufficient to address persistent decent work deficits as young workers continue to face high unemployment rates, around 12.6%, with little sign of improvement, it added.\n\nLabor Secretary Bienvenido E. Laguesma said the department conducted \u201cextensive national consultations,\u201d culminating in the upcoming 10-year Trabaho Para sa Bayan (TPB) Plan to address weak job growth.\n\n\u201cThrough these initiatives, we have identified several key areas of intervention that align with the goals of the TPB Plan and aim to address the challenges of regional employment disparities, particularly in rural areas,\u201d he told BusinessWorld in a Viber message over the weekend.\n\n\u201cAgriculture remains a cornerstone of rural employment, and we are committed to transforming this sector to boost productivity and job creation,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted the Labor department aims to introduce technology-enabled farming practices, climate-resilient methods and value-added processes into agribusiness through the Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives will not only create more jobs but also enhance the sustainability and profitability of rural livelihoods,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Agency\u2019s (PSA) November 2024 Labor Force Survey, the agriculture sector experienced the highest year on year job loss, with 1.99 Filipinos leaving the sector.\n\nThe agency attributed the loss to typhoons.\n\nRURAL WORKFORCE\n\nAccording to Mr. Laguesma, DoLE is empowering local government units (LGUs) to spearhead rural development by supporting them with investment strategies, microfinance for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and infrastructure projects under the Build Better More program.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives will ensure that rural areas become hubs for inclusive economic activity,\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition, DoLE is collaborating with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and local institutions, prioritizing tailored skills training.\n\nPrograms will focus on green skills development, digital upskilling and vocational training to prepare rural workers for opportunities in sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, and renewable energy, he noted.\n\n\u201cOur Public Employment Service Offices (PESOs) are key to facilitating job placement and matching in rural areas,\u201d he added, noting that digitalization and enhancing labor market intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe aim to make employment services more accessible and effective, enabling rural job seekers to connect with opportunities tailored to their skills and aspirations,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe labor chief also added the department is committed to fostering sustainable job opportunities in agriculture, eco-tourism and clean energy. These green initiatives will ensure long-term job creation while protecting environmental resources.\n\nSocial safety nets for rural workers are critical, he noted, adding the ILO has been helping DoLE in achieving these initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe will broaden coverage of social protection programs to include informal workers, addressing vulnerabilities and providing stability during economic transitions,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBy prioritizing rural job creation and addressing regional disparities, we aim to build a resilient and equitable labor market where every Filipino has access to quality employment.\u201d"

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, in coordination with Turks and Caicos officials, is investigating the fallout, though no injuries have been reported.\n\nIn Belgium, scientist Clement Martin is collaborating with federal police to create a groundbreaking scent mimicking the smell of dried bones, helping sniffer dogs locate long-missing remains. This innovation follows Martin's earlier work isolating the scent of decomposing flesh, now essential in training cadaver dogs across Belgium.\n\nMeanwhile, archaeological explorations in Pompeii have uncovered an opulent private bath complex, providing insights into the affluent lifestyle of the Romans before the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The newly unearthed site features hot, warm, and cold baths that could accommodate up to 30 guests, adorned with Greek mythological themes, showcasing the luxury of that era.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "In a groundbreaking discovery that sounds like science fiction but is absolutely real, researchers have found that your eyes contain hidden signals that could predict your risk of having a stroke. This revolutionary finding isn\u2019t just another medical study, it\u2019s a potential game-changer in how we approach stroke prevention and early detection.\n\nThe incredible science behind retinal fingerprints\n\nScientists have identified 29 unique vascular indicators in your retina that serve as warning signs for stroke risk. These tiny blood vessels in your eyes create patterns as unique as your fingerprints, and their condition can reveal crucial information about your overall health. Within these indicators, 17 are density-related markers that can increase your stroke risk by up to 19% when altered. These changes are like tiny red flags waving in your eyes, signaling potential danger before other symptoms appear. The remaining indicators focus on the size and twistedness of blood vessels, with changes potentially raising stroke risk by nearly 20%. Think of these vessels as tiny roads in your eyes, their condition reflecting the health of your entire cardiovascular system.\n\nWhy this discovery is absolutely mind-blowing\n\nTraditional stroke risk assessments often involve invasive procedures and expensive tests. But this new method requires nothing more than a specialized photograph of your eye. The implications are enormous, especially for communities where access to advanced medical testing is limited or cost-prohibitive.\n\nThe beauty of this breakthrough lies in its simplicity. During a routine eye exam, doctors can capture detailed images of your retina and analyze them for these crucial indicators. It\u2019s painless, quick, and could potentially save countless lives through early detection.\n\nThe fascinating connection between your eyes and brain\n\nYour retina isn\u2019t just a window to your soul, it\u2019s actually an extension of your brain. Every tiny blood vessel in your eye tells a story about the health of your brain\u2019s blood vessels. This connection explains why changes in your retinal vasculature can predict stroke risk with remarkable accuracy.\n\nWhat makes this discovery revolutionary\n\nThe research team analyzed data from over 45,000 participants. This massive study revealed that retinal analysis combined with basic demographic information could predict stroke risk as accurately as traditional methods.\n\nWhat\u2019s truly remarkable is how this technology could transform preventive healthcare. Imagine walking into your local eye clinic and getting a comprehensive stroke risk assessment during your regular eye exam. This isn\u2019t just convenient, it\u2019s revolutionary for global health care accessibility.\n\nThe global impact of this breakthrough\n\nThis discovery could dramatically change how we approach stroke prevention worldwide. In regions where advanced medical facilities are scarce, a simple eye scan could become a lifesaving tool. The technology could help identify at-risk individuals years before they might experience a stroke, allowing for early intervention and prevention strategies.\n\nHealthcare providers are particularly excited about implementing this technology in primary care settings. It could become as routine as checking blood pressure, but with the potential to reveal much more detailed information about cardiovascular health.\n\nWhat this means for the future of healthcare\n\nThe implications extend far beyond stroke prediction. Researchers believe similar retinal analysis could help predict other conditions like heart disease and dementia. This opens up endless possibilities for early detection and prevention of various diseases through simple eye examinations.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, we might see artificial intelligence systems analyzing these retinal images in real-time, providing instant risk assessments and recommendations. This could revolutionize how we approach preventive healthcare, making it more accessible and effective than ever before.\n\nThe discovery of retinal vascular fingerprints as predictors of stroke risk isn\u2019t just a scientific breakthrough, it\u2019s a glimpse into the future of medicine. It shows us that sometimes the most powerful diagnostic tools are hidden in plain sight, waiting to be understood and utilized. As this technology develops and becomes more widely available, it could transform how we approach disease prevention and ultimately save countless lives through early detection and intervention."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been referred to as a generational opportunity by leadership at some of the top tech companies in the world. While some of the benefits are already beginning to be felt, AI still looks to be in the early stages of its development as a revolutionary technology.\n\nGiven that there is still a long way to go in AI's development, there is also seemingly plenty of opportunity left for companies to benefit and potentially help make investors who get in early into millionaires. Let's look at three stocks across AI infrastructure, cloud computing, and software that could push a millionaire-making portfolio to its goal over the long haul.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest AI winners thus far, but that doesn't preclude it from continuing to be a big winner. Computing power is paramount for training large language models (LLMs) and running inference needed for AI's development and operations. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have proven to be one of the best chips to accomplish these tasks. One of two big GPU designers, Nvidia has been able to take a dominant market share of nearly 90% in the space with the help of its CUDA software platform, which makes it much easier to program GPUs for various AI tasks.\n\nAs such, Nvidia's GPUs have become the backbone of AI data center infrastructure, which continues to grow at a rapid pace. As companies look to train more sophisticated LLMs, they need exponentially more computing power. Some of the latest versions of AI models require 10 times as many GPUs as their prior versions in order to accomplish their computationally intensive tasks. There are indications that there could be LLMs requiring 1 million AI chip clusters in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, AI infrastructure remains robust, with Nvidia's largest customer Microsoft recently announcing it would spend an astonishing $80 billion building out data centers in 2025. Other large tech companies have also indicated that they plan to increase their AI-related spending this year.\n\nWith no end currently in sight for AI infrastructure spending, Nvidia continues to look like a long-term winner. Meanwhile, the stock is attractively priced with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of below 30 and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) under 1, which generally indicates a stock is undervalued.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is hoping to be an AI winner in several areas. The company has already seen strong growth in its cloud computing unit, Google Cloud, which saw its revenue jump 35% last quarter, as it helps customers build out their own AI models and applications. Meanwhile, the high-fixed-cost business has grown to a point where it is now profitable. As a result, segment income surged from $266 million in the year-ago quarter to $1.95 billion in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nWithin the data center segment of its business, Alphabet has also designed its own custom AI chips with the help of Broadcom. By using these custom tensor processing units (TPUs) in combination with GPUs, Alphabet is improving AI inference processing times and lowering costs for its users and clients. That could help give the segment even more operating leverage.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet has a nice opportunity with AI search and its Gemini AI assistant app. The company historically has only served ads on about 20% of its searches, so eventually monetizing its AI Overviews and Gemini app results would be a nice future opportunity. The company has also taken the lead in multimodal AI, with things such as text-to-video generation and visual search.\n\nThe company is also a leader in some other AI-adjacent emerging technologies including quantum computing and autonomous driving. The stock, meanwhile, is attractively valued, trading at a forward P/E of 19 times.\n\nArtist rendering of robotic AI.\n\nImage source: Getty Images\n\n3. Salesforce\n\nWhile AI infrastructure and cloud computing companies have seen the biggest revenue growth, agentic AI could be the next big wave. The AI getting the most attention at the moment has been generative AI, where AI can produce images, sound, or text in response to a user query. Agentic AI takes that a step further -- AI agents can go out and autonomously perform tasks within given parameters with little human supervision.\n\nSalesforce (NYSE: CRM) is looking to be at the forefront of agentic AI with its new Agentforce solution. The company already has a large customer base with its customer relationship management (CRM) software platform, and it will look to upsell these customers to its new AI agents. The company will have a number of out-of-the-box agents that can perform tasks in such areas as customer service, sales and marketing, and recruiting, while they will also be customizable through its no-code and low-code tools.\n\nReleased only in October, Agentforce has grown quickly, with the company saying it had more than 1,000 deals in place in mid-December. It projects to have 1 billion agents in force in fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026). Agentforce is a consumption product that costs $2 per conversation, so the more useful customers find its agents, the more upside it has.\n\nSalesforce currently trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 7.4 times fiscal 2026 analyst estimates, which is very reasonable given the opportunity in front of it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $843,960!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Israel said earlier it would keep fighting until the names were handed over in accordance with the agreement.\n\nHamas blamed the delay in handing over the names on \u201ctechnical field reasons.\u201d It said in a statement that it is committed to the ceasefire deal announced last week.\n\nThe ceasefire is set to pause the fighting after 15 months of war and see the release of dozens of hostages held by the militants in the Gaza Strip and hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

If it was, every hostage, including my brother-in-law, Omri, would return home tomorrow. So we are not optimistic.\u201d\n\nOlivier Jaoui, a relative of French-Israeli hostage Ofer Kalderon, said families have \u201cmany concerns because we don\u2019t know who is alive, who is dead among the hostages and in particular, for us, Ofer Kalderon, our cousin.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe added that \u201canother concern, obviously, is in what state they will return.\u201d\n\nIsrael names all 3 hostages set to release on Sunday\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 An Israeli official confirmed that Romi Gonen, 24, Emily Damari, 28, and Doron Steinbrecher, 31, were set to be released later on Sunday.\n\nGonen was abducted from the Nova music festival, while the other two were kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza.

He welcomed the expected return of the hostages held in Gaza, calling them his \u201cbrothers and sisters.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut the 35-year-old criticized the ceasefire-for-hostages deal that he saw as kicking the problem down the road. He said he believed that by allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza, the Israeli government is fueling the regrouping and rearming of Hamas.\n\n\u201cThey will take the time and attack again,\u201d he said.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike kills 8 in Gaza, medics say\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip \u2014 An Israeli airstrike killed at least eight people in the Gaza Strip after the ceasefire was delayed, Palestinian medical officials said.\n\nNasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis confirmed the casualties from Sunday\u2019s strike, which it said had occurred around two hours after the truce was supposed to take effect.\n\nIsrael said Hamas delayed the start of the truce by not naming the hostages it was supposed to release later on Sunday.

But Ben-Gvir\u2019s departure destabilizes the coalition.\n\nIsrael says it recovered the body of a soldier killed in 2014 hours before Gaza ceasefire\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israeli authorities said Sunday that forces had recovered and returned the body of a soldier killed in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war, whose remains were held by the Palestinian militant group in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli military spokesperson Rear Adm.

It will pause the fighting after 15 months of war and see the release of dozens of hostages held by the militants in the Gaza Strip and hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nDozens of Israelis protest ceasefire deal in Jerusalem\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Dozens of Israelis protested the ceasefire deal in Jerusalem on Saturday night, briefly blocking a main road as they shouted for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign and the war to continue.\n\nMany carried faux coffins draped in the Israeli flag as well as banners calling the ceasefire a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Israeli soldiers killed in the war.\n\nYehoshua Shin, whose son was killed fighting Hamas militants on Oct. 7, criticized the deal for releasing Palestinians from prison and called on American president- elect Donald Trump to scrap the deal until there is \u201ctotal victory\u201d over the Hamas militant group.\n\nNetanyahu says Israel treating ceasefire with Hamas as temporary\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that Israel is treating the ceasefire with Hamas as temporary and retains the right to continue fighting if necessary.\n\nSpeaking to the nation just 12 hours before the ceasefire is to start, he claimed that he had the support of President-elect Donald Trump, who he said he spoke with on Wednesday.\n\nNetanyahu also touted Israel\u2019s military successes in Lebanon and Syria as the reason Hamas agreed to a ceasefire. \u201cWe have changed the face of the Middle East,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nNetanyahu stressed that he was able to negotiate the best deal possible even as Israel\u2019s far-right Public Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said Saturday he and most of his party would resign from the government in opposition.\n\nWith files from Tia Goldenberg and Josef Federman"

            "article_content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an incredible technology, and we've only scratched the surface of its potential. Currently, it's being used as a program on the side of normal work, but it's about to enter a new phase: Agentic AI. Agentic AI, often called AI agents, involves setting up software programs to do tasks that humans normally do. This next phase in implementing AI is critical, as it will allow those at the cutting edge to do more with fewer resources.\n\nOne of the leaders in agentic AI is Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). The software company is making a heavy push to promote and integrate agentic AI, and it also has one of the best platforms for implementing it.\n\nSalesforce's platform is ripe for agentic AI integration\n\nSalesforce makes customer relationship management (CRM) software. CRM is an incredibly broad sector but can generally be summarized as a business interaction with a potential customer from the marketing stage to after-sale support. There's a lot that happens between those two points, and Salesforce software is there to offer support along the way.\n\nMany customer interactions can be automated by AI agents, which is why agentic AI is such a massive trend for Salesforce. As with most software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, the more add-ons you have from the base software package, the more expensive it gets. This unlocks another milestone for the generative AI trend; we're reaching a point where many companies are starting to monetize their AI investments.\n\nSalesforce's CEO and co-founder, Marc Benioff, is extremely bullish on agentic AI. During the company's 2024 Dreamforce conference, he stated, \"This is what AI was meant to be.\" That's a big statement, but the ability for companies to become more efficient and free their workers up to do tasks that require original thinking will be a huge change for many in the workforce.\n\nHowever, does this one technology have the ability to drive Salesforce's stock to new heights?\n\nSalesforce needs this new technology to kick-start growth again\n\nSalesforce is a mature software company that started to shift from growth-at-all-costs to maximizing profitability a few years ago. However, its sales growth has been a bit slow, by most software company standards, over the past few quarters. In its fiscal 2025's third quarter (ended Oct. 31), revenue was up 8% year over year to $9.44 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) were $1.60 versus $1.26 a year ago -- a 27% gain.\n\nEPS growth outpaced revenue growth because of Salesforce's rising margins. During last year's third quarter, Salesforce posted operating margins of 17.8%. This year, it delivered 20.6% operating margins. This will be a key trend to watch, as some of the most profitable software companies can reach profit margins of up to 30%. It will likely be some time before Salesforce can reach that level (if it can), but shareholders will be elated if it does.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "A tech professional recently shared valuable insights on social media about navigating layoffs after being let go by a prominent tech company. Reflecting on his experience, he emphasized the importance of financial preparedness , skill enhancement, and leveraging professional networks. Building an emergency fund with 6\u201312 months of living expenses provided him the flexibility to focus on finding the right opportunity. He also credited certifications in AI and machine learning, such as Google Cloud ML Engineer and Microsoft Azure AI Engineer, for helping his resume stand out and accelerating interview calls. Networking proved critical, with referrals from ex-colleagues, mentors, and LinkedIn posts opening new doors. He also recommended exploring roles in non-tech industries like finance and healthcare, which are increasingly hiring for AI and automation projects. Freelancing, he noted, was another avenue to maintain skills, expand networks, and gain experience while job hunting.In a similar situation, another techie sought advice online after being laid off in September. Having returned to India after working abroad and boasting nine years of experience in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and data, he faced challenges in the local job market, including rejections or significantly lower salary offers. The lack of preparation in competitive coding practices like DSA and Leetcode further added to his struggles. The tech professional expressed frustration and embarrassment after three months without an offer.Online responses suggested exploring opportunities abroad, especially in regions like the Middle East, where AI and tech roles are in demand. Others advised accepting lower-paying offers temporarily while continuing to search for better roles. Some users expressed surprise at the challenges faced by AI and ML professionals, questioning whether the demand in these fields was dwindling or if entry into data science had become increasingly competitive."

Moscow called the attack retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, which in recent weeks appear to have intensified.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said that four ballistic missiles and 39 attack drones had been launched in the assault and that two of the ballistic missiles had been shot down in the Kyiv region. Although the city comes under drone attack almost nightly, ballistic missile launches targeting the capital are less frequent.\n\nThe pre-dawn attack ruptured a water main near the city center, sending water cascading through the streets around the battered facade of the Lukianivska subway station. Nearby, smoke was rising from a charred van with at least two burned bodies inside."

            "article_content": "A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip came into effect on Sunday, following a delay of nearly three hours. The truce halts a devastating 15-month-long conflict that has caused widespread destruction and loss of life. After months of intricate and tense negotiations, the agreement aims to provide a reprieve from the violence that has gripped the region, while addressing the political and humanitarian crises exacerbated by the ongoing war.\n\nDespite the delayed start, residents and medical workers in Gaza reported no new fighting or military strikes after about 30 minutes before the ceasefire was implemented. However, Israeli airstrikes and artillery attacks killed 13 Palestinians in Gaza between 06:30 GMT, when the ceasefire was originally set to begin, and 09:15 GMT, when it was finally enacted, according to Palestinian medics.\n\n#WATCH | Delhi | Reuven Azar, Israeli Ambassador to India, says, \"The ceasefire Israel signed off to is the first phase of a gradual deal which has the potential of bringing back our hostages and also making sure Hamas won't be ever able to massacre Israelis like it did on\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fBZwWi7jNP Also Read Air Canada plane catches fire during landing at Halifax airport, incident happens hours after fatal South Korea plane tragedy \u2013 Watch \u2018IITian Baba\u2019 Abhey Singh expelled from Juna Akhara for disrespecting his guru; he responds Indian Railways\u2019 expansion in West Bengal: 43 rail projects spanning 4,479 km underway in the state, says Ashwini Vaishnaw FPIs turn net sellers after two weeks of buying, withdraw Rs 976 crore amid global uncertainty January 19, 2025\n\nReasons for the Delay\n\nIsrael\u2019s military blamed Hamas for the delay, citing the Palestinian militant group\u2019s failure to provide a list of hostages to be released as part of the agreement. Hamas attributed the delay to \u201ctechnical\u201d reasons, though it did not elaborate further. A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated that the delay was due to mediators requesting 48 hours of \u201ccalm\u201d before the ceasefire, but Israeli strikes had made it difficult to send the list of names.\n\nAlso Read Israeli PM Netanyahu delays Gaza ceasefire until Hamas releases hostage list\n\nTwo hours after the deadline, Hamas announced that it had sent the names of the hostages to be released, with Israeli officials confirming the receipt. The three hostages named for release on Sunday were Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher, and Emily Damari, although Israel did not immediately confirm their identities.\n\nDetails of the Ceasefire Agreement\n\nThe ceasefire deal follows months of on-again, off-again negotiations, involving mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and the United States. The deal, which is seen as a potential step toward ending the Gaza war, is structured in three stages. The first stage will last six weeks and will involve the release of 33 of the remaining 98 hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe first hostages to be released will include women, children, and the elderly, and they are expected to be transferred through the Red Cross. In return for each of the hostages released, Israel will free 30 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas will coordinate with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to determine the meeting points inside Gaza for the handover.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement, though a step forward, does not yet guarantee a full resolution to the conflict. The ongoing war, which erupted after Hamas launched attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, has claimed thousands of lives, with nearly 47,000 Palestinians killed in the conflict. The war has also exacerbated tensions throughout the Middle East, drawing in Iranian-backed militant groups and causing diplomatic isolation for Israel.\n\n(With Reuters Inputs)"

            "article_content": "Dogecoin price consolidated above the $0.40 area on Sunday as Donald Trump\u2019s newly-launched token gained market share. Is the DOGE price rally at risk of losing momentum ?\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Dips Below $0.40 as Trump\u2019s latest move shifts investors focus\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) emerged one of the standout performers since Donald Trump was re-elected in 2025. However, after Donald Trump launched an official \u2018TRUMP\u2019 memecoin in a TruthSocial post on January 18, the market dynamics have shifted considerably.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDogecoin was left lagging as the global crypto market gained further traction on Sunday. According to TradingView data, while BTC breaching $105,000 and Solana price reaching a new all-time high of $275 per coin, DOGE price declined 8.8%, falling below the $0.40 mark at press time on January 19.\n\nDOGE Stumbles as Trump Token Pulls $15B Market Demand\n\nOver the past three months, DOGE has enjoyed a close association with the Trump administration, partly due to Elon Musk\u2019s influence within government circles. Musk, a vocal proponent of DOGE, frequently promoted the memecoin during his public appearances and campaigns.\n\nHowever, this dynamic shifted significantly with the recent launch of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s official memecoin, TRUMP, hosted on the Solana blockchain.\n\nWithin 48 hours of its debut, the TRUMP token amassed an impressive market capitalization of $7.2 billion, reflecting widespread positive sentiment among investors.\n\nWhile this rapid growth indicates widespread positive market reception for TRUMP, it has also triggered an unintended negative impact on older, legacy memecoins.\n\nTokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) appear to have lost traction as the TRUMP token encroaches more market share.\n\nThe SosoValue chart above presents the performance of select cryptocurrency tokens remotely linked to the Trump administration. As depicted, TRUMP token market capitalization crossed $7.84 billion while attracting a staggering $14.8 billion in trading volume on Sunday.\n\nThis figure nearly triples the $5.4 billion in trading volume accrued to Dogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization during the same period. The disparity in performance highlights a clear shift in investor focus.\n\nFirst, the simultaneous decline in DOGE trading volume and price suggests that many investors are reallocating funds from Dogecoin to TRUMP, likely to capitalize on the fresh profit opportunities and novelty of Trump\u2019s new project.\n\nIf this trend persist, the ascent of the TRUMP token could further disrupt the market dominance of legacy memecoins like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI.\n\nMeanwhile the likes of Dogwifhat (WIF), BONK, and Pudgy Penguins stand to benefit immensely, as the Trump coin launch brings new entrants, fresh capital inflows, and additional media attention towards the Solana memecoin ecosystem.\n\nDogecoin price forecast: Bulls to regroup at $0.40 support level\n\nDespite a 9% drop off to $0.38 technical indicators suggest further bearish outlook for Dogecoin price prediction.\n\nThe Bollinger Bands (BB) show significant price contraction, with DOGE testing support near $0.3593 (lower BB boundary). This indicates rising pressure, potentially favoring a bearish breakout if selling persists.\n\nVolume Delta readings also show negative momentum, with -$529.82M in net outflows, reinforcing short-term bearish sentiment. Should DOGE breach $0.36, the next support lies at $0.3027, aligning with December lows.\n\nConversely, the midline of the Bollinger Bands ($0.3593) intersects with the 50-day Moving Average, offering a possible pivot for recovery.\n\nIf bulls regain control, DOGE could reclaim $0.40 (upper BB), a psychological and technical resistance\n\nTraders should monitor volume shifts and potential retests of the $0.36 zone.\n\nWhile short-term weakness persists, long-term momentum could favor bulls, provided macro sentiment supports memecoins. DOGE traders can anticipate a prolonged cautious consolidation near the $0.37-$0.41 price range.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. 1. Why is Dogecoin price down today? Dogecoin price retraced to $0.40 due to competition from Donald Trump\u2019s newly launched TRUMP token gaining market traction. 2. 2. How has the TRUMP token impacted Dogecoin? TRUMP token captured $14.8 billion in trading volume, diverting market focus and causing DOGE price to drop by 9%. 3. Can Dogecoin recover from the $0.40 level? The Bollinger Bands and Volume Delta indicators suggest DOGE could consolidate and potentially rebound early if bears avoid a close below $0.40.\n\nibrahim\n\nDisclaimer: The presented content may include the personal opinion of the author and is subject to market condition.

(Photo Credits: Israel Antiquitis Authority/Atiqot)\n\nA religious shrine, believed to have been sealed by the ancestors of Jesus and preserved for nearly 3,000 years, has been uncovered in Jerusalem, according to a report by the New York Post. The shrine, carved into the rock near Temple Mount, features eight rooms including an altar, a sacred standing stone and presses for making olive oil and wine.\n\nExperts believe the destruction of this shrine could be linked to the biblical figure Hezekiah, an ancestor of Jesus. Though excavations began in 2010, the northern part of the site was first discovered in 1909 by British explorer Montague Parker.\n\nrelated stories\n\nEli Shukron, the excavation director at the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), published findings in the IAA\u2019s scientific journal Atiqot. Shukron explained that the shrine dates back to Hezekiah\u2019s reign when other ritual sites existed outside the main temple during the First Temple period.\n\n\u201cThe structure ceased to function during the 8th century BC, possibly as part of King Hezekiah\u2019s religious reform,\" Shukron told the outlet.\n\nAccording to the Bible, Hezekiah\u2019s reforms aimed to centralise worship at the temple in Jerusalem and abolish scattered ritual sites across the kingdom. Both Hezekiah and his successor, Josiah, are mentioned as paternal grandfathers of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.\n\nHezekiah\u2019s actions are described as a campaign to destroy pagan worship locations including sacred stones. The standing stone at this site survived Hezekiah\u2019s abolition.\n\nShukron referred to the discovery as \u201cthe most dramatic and important find in the excavation.\"\n\n\u201cIt is what makes this place a cultic site. When we uncovered it, we found it standing in its place, with stones around it. The standing stone was covered with earth; it was preserved \u2013 no one destroyed it,\" Shukron said.\n\n\u201cWhen we found it, it was exactly as it was here 2,800 years ago,\" he added.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nThe excavation team also discovered the remnants of an altar, identifiable by a drainage channel that still runs from one of its corners. In another area of the site, obscure v-shaped carvings were found on the floor. These carvings are thought to have supported a ritual tripod.\n\nDuring the excavation, archaeologists uncovered several 8th-century BC artefacts hidden behind a stone wall in a cave. These items included cooking vessels, jars marked with ancient Hebrew inscriptions, and items used for daily life such as loom weights and grinding stones. They also found scarabs and seals with decorative designs.\n\nLocation : Delhi, India\n\nFirst Published: January 19, 2025, 15:00 IST"

            "article_content": "Recent UFO Cloud Sightings Over the UK: A Growing Phenomenon\n\nIn recent years, the United Kingdom has become a hotspot for unusual atmospheric phenomena, including sightings of UFO clouds. While UFO sightings themselves are not new, there has been a notable increase in reports of strange cloud formations that appear to be connected to UFO activity. These incidents have fuelled speculation that the skies above the UK might be hiding more than just ordinary weather patterns. From rural areas in Scotland to urban centres in England, observers have documented several UFO-related cloud events, prompting fresh debates about the connection between these clouds and extraterrestrial craft.\n\nWhen people think of UFOs, they often envision saucer-shaped craft zooming through the sky, or strange lights darting across the night. However, there is another intriguing phenomenon that has become linked with UFO sightings\u2014UFO clouds. These mysterious cloud formations, which often appear anomalous or out of place, have sparked numerous theories and debates over the years. Are these clouds simply rare meteorological events, or could they be related to extraterrestrial activity? In this article, we explore the fascinating world of UFO clouds, the possible causes behind them, and how they tie into UFO lore.\n\nWhat Are UFO Clouds?\n\nThe term \"UFO cloud\" refers to a type of cloud formation that appears unusual or particularly striking in appearance, often leading observers to associate them with unidentified flying objects or extraterrestrial phenomena. These clouds are typically characterised by their strange shape, colour, or movement, and they often appear in areas where UFO sightings have been reported. While some of these clouds are nothing more than unusual atmospheric phenomena, others appear to defy typical meteorological explanations, sparking theories of alien involvement.\n\nOne of the most common characteristics of UFO clouds is their circular or disc-like shape. They often appear as smooth, flat clouds with defined edges, resembling the classic depictions of UFOs in popular culture. These formations can be strikingly similar to the saucer-shaped objects that UFO enthusiasts believe extraterrestrials use for travel. As a result, many UFO sightings involve reports of a UFO cloud in the vicinity, further fueling speculation about their connection.\n\nThe 2021 \"Saucer Cloud\" Incident Over London\n\nOne of the most widely reported UFO cloud sightings in recent UK history occurred in London in 2021. Witnesses described seeing a disc-shaped cloud hovering over the skyline, with its smooth, circular edges resembling the classic depiction of a UFO. The cloud was observed in broad daylight, and although it did not move in a manner that suggested it was a flying object, the perfectly symmetrical shape led many onlookers to wonder if it was an optical illusion caused by a UFO. Eyewitnesses also noted that the cloud appeared to glow faintly in the light, further enhancing its surreal and otherworldly presence.\n\nSeveral UFO researchers quickly jumped on the case, suggesting that the cloud could be linked to some form of atmospheric disturbance created by a UFO. Meteorologists, however, suggested that the cloud could have been a rare lenticular cloud, which can form in circular shapes under specific atmospheric conditions, especially near mountain ranges or strong wind currents. Still, the resemblance to the saucer-shaped craft often seen in UFO sightings was too uncanny to ignore, and the event gained significant attention on social media.\n\nUFO Cloud Sightings in Scotland\u2019s Highlands\n\nIn Scotland, particularly in the remote Highlands, there have been increasing reports of mysterious cloud formations that coincide with UFO sightings. In 2020, a group of hikers in the Cairngorms National Park described seeing unusual cloud structures in the sky, which they believed were connected to a UFO. The clouds were described as massive, elongated formations that appeared to \"move\" in strange patterns, with some observers even reporting that the clouds seemed to change shape rapidly, as if they were being manipulated by a force beyond the natural elements.\n\nSome locals in rural parts of Scotland have long been proponents of the idea that the area\u2019s isolation and its connection to ancient folklore might attract UFOs or otherworldly visitors. These recent cloud sightings, coupled with ongoing UFO reports, have only strengthened these theories. The belief that UFOs use the clouds as a form of camouflage or as a by-product of their energy emissions has found fertile ground in these remote communities.\n\nStrange Clouds Over Manchester\n\nIn late 2022, Manchester, a bustling urban centre in the north of England, became the site of another mysterious cloud sighting. Several witnesses reported seeing a dark, swirling cloud that appeared to hover for an unusually long period above the city. The cloud was said to take on an amorphous, disc-like form before dissipating into the sky without any clear explanation.\n\nWhat made this sighting particularly intriguing was the concurrent UFO sighting reported by a resident just hours before. According to the witness, they saw a series of bright lights darting across the sky, followed by the sudden appearance of the swirling cloud. Some speculated that the cloud might have been a side effect of the UFO\u2019s propulsion system, or that the lights and cloud were linked in some way. A few local news outlets picked up the story, with experts offering both mundane meteorological explanations and more speculative theories involving extraterrestrial phenomena.\n\nThe Connection Between UFOs and Clouds in the UK\n\nThe recent spate of UFO cloud sightings over the UK has led some to wonder whether there is a pattern connecting these unusual formations to extraterrestrial activity. The country has seen a notable uptick in UFO reports over the past decade, with several credible witnesses\u2014ranging from military personnel to ordinary citizens\u2014describing sightings of strange lights or unidentified craft in the sky.\n\nSome UFO enthusiasts and researchers argue that the unusual clouds could be camouflage for UFOs, a way for extraterrestrial craft to hide their presence in plain sight. According to this theory, UFOs might create or manipulate cloud formations in such a way as to remain undetected by conventional observation, blending in with the natural weather patterns.\n\nOthers speculate that these clouds may be linked to atmospheric anomalies created by UFO propulsion systems. Some UFOs, especially those described as \"saucer-shaped\", are often associated with electromagnetic or plasma-based propulsion methods. According to proponents of this theory, the interaction between the craft\u2019s energy field and the surrounding atmosphere could lead to the formation of oddly shaped clouds, which could be mistaken for a natural weather phenomenon.\n\nAdditionally, it's possible that the rise in sightings of UFO clouds is simply a result of heightened public awareness and media coverage of UFO phenomena. As UFOs and related sightings become a more widely discussed topic\u2014thanks in part to government disclosures and the release of previously classified reports\u2014more people may be looking at the sky with a more discerning eye, noticing unusual cloud formations that they might have otherwise overlooked.\n\nScientific and Meteorological Explanations\n\nOf course, there are scientific explanations for most of these strange cloud sightings. As mentioned earlier, lenticular clouds and roll clouds are two of the most commonly misidentified formations. Both types of clouds have a characteristic shape that can resemble UFOs or discs, particularly when seen from certain angles or under specific lighting conditions.\n\nMeteorologists also point out that some weather systems\u2014such as cold fronts or warm air surges\u2014can produce clouds that appear to behave in unusual ways, such as hanging low in the sky or shifting shape rapidly. Such phenomena could be responsible for some of the recent reports in the UK, especially those involving swirling, elongated clouds.\n\nTypes of UFO Clouds\n\nThough no official meteorological classification exists for UFO clouds, several specific types of cloud formations have become associated with UFO phenomena. These clouds share certain characteristics, which make them seem out of place or highly unusual. Here are some of the most common types:\n\n1. Lenticular Clouds\n\nLenticular clouds are large, lens-shaped clouds that often form over mountains or other elevated terrain. These clouds are typically stationary and can take on a disc-like appearance, which has led many to speculate that they are associated with UFOs. Lenticular clouds are formed when air flows over a mountain range, creating a standing wave of air. As the air moves upward and cools, it condenses into a cloud, and its shape can appear very similar to a saucer or disc.\n\nLenticular clouds are commonly mistaken for UFOs because of their smooth, distinct shape, and they often appear to hover in the sky. While these clouds are completely natural and can be explained by atmospheric science, their resemblance to UFOs has contributed to numerous sightings and theories about extraterrestrial activity.\n\n2. Roll Clouds\n\nA roll cloud is a type of low, horizontal cloud that can appear to \"roll\" across the sky, giving it a cylindrical appearance. These clouds are usually associated with storm fronts and can stretch for hundreds of miles. Although roll clouds are a well-known meteorological phenomenon, their long, uniform shape and movement can create an eerie or otherworldly effect. In some cases, roll clouds have been reported in conjunction with UFO sightings, and their unusual, rolling motion has led to speculation that they may be linked to alien technology or atmospheric anomalies caused by UFOs.\n\n3. Mammatus Clouds\n\nMammatus clouds are puffy, balloon-like formations that typically appear beneath the base of a thunderstorm cloud. They often create a striking and somewhat ominous visual effect, with their bulbous, sagging appearance giving them a surreal, otherworldly quality. While mammatus clouds are associated with intense thunderstorms, their strange shape and eerie nature have caused some to connect them with UFOs or extraterrestrial activity. The clouds' unusual appearance, particularly when seen in isolation or during an otherwise calm period, can evoke images of hovering ships or alien craft, leading to UFO-related speculation.\n\n4. Noctilucent Clouds\n\nNoctilucent clouds are high-altitude clouds that are most visible during the summer months, especially at latitudes between 50 and 70 degrees north and south. These clouds form in the mesosphere, far higher than typical clouds, and they glow with an eerie, blue or silver light after sunset. While the phenomenon can be explained by the reflection of sunlight on ice crystals in the clouds, the unusual, glowing nature of noctilucent clouds has led to various UFO-related theories. Their ethereal glow and unusual location in the atmosphere have given rise to questions about whether they might be linked to extraterrestrial activity or even serve as a cover for UFOs.\n\nUFO Clouds and the UFO Phenomenon\n\nThe connection between UFO clouds and UFO sightings is a subject of intense fascination for both UFO enthusiasts and meteorologists. Some individuals claim that certain UFO clouds are associated with UFO activity, suggesting that the clouds might be a type of camouflage or atmospheric distortion created by alien spacecraft. Others believe that UFOs themselves may be responsible for the formation of these clouds, either as a result of the energy they emit or the atmospheric disturbances they cause.\n\nOne of the most notable cases linking UFOs to clouds occurred in 1957, when several people reported seeing a UFO hovering above a strange cloud formation over the Pacific Northwest in the United States. The object was described as disc-shaped, and the cloud that formed underneath it appeared to be perfectly round, prompting some to believe that the cloud was the result of the UFO\u2019s activity. Since then, similar reports of UFO sightings coinciding with unusual cloud formations have been documented, further cementing the idea that there may be a connection.\n\nScientific Explanations vs. Extraterrestrial Theories\n\nWhile UFO clouds are often seen as evidence of alien involvement in atmospheric phenomena, there are more grounded scientific explanations for these unusual cloud formations. Meteorologists argue that many of the clouds associated with UFO sightings are simply natural occurrences. Lenticular clouds, roll clouds, and mammatus clouds are all well-documented and have clear meteorological explanations that do not require the involvement of extraterrestrial beings.\n\nHowever, the mystique of UFOs and the possibility of alien life continues to captivate the human imagination. For many, the idea that UFOs might be responsible for certain cloud formations provides a compelling narrative that fits within the broader framework of UFO lore. The persistent sightings of these clouds, combined with the belief in extraterrestrial visitation, means that UFO clouds will likely continue to fuel theories and debates for years to come.\n\nConclusion: A Continued Mystery\n\nThe recent sightings of UFO clouds in the UK serve to deepen the mystery surrounding both unidentified flying objects and the enigmatic nature of cloud formations. While scientific explanations are readily available, the persistent association of these unusual clouds with UFO sightings continues to fuel the debate about extraterrestrial involvement.\n\nAs UFO sightings remain a popular subject of fascination for many, it seems likely that these strange, disc-shaped clouds and anomalous weather phenomena will continue to spark curiosity. Whether they are merely natural atmospheric events or signs of something more profound remains a question that has yet to be definitively answered. For now, the skies above the UK\u2014and the mysterious clouds within them\u2014remain a captivating enigma."

This university played an important role in the movement,\" the press secretary said.\n\nNoting that this image should be conveyed to the world as the future of the students is related to the image, he said, \"We have to work to preserve the history of the movement of this university.\"\n\nHe said the names of the halls that still remain in the name of the dictator need to be changed to the martyrs' names.\n\nThe press secretary said the aspirations of people are being fulfilled through reform commissions to build a new Bangladesh.\n\nThe reports of commissions are the outcomes of the July Uprising, he said, urging all students to read these reports and join debate on those on the campus.\n\nChaired by Chairman of IU Communication and Multimedia Journalism Department Professor Dr Rashiduzzaman, the seminar was addressed, among others, by IU Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Nakib Muhammad Nasrullah, Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Yeaqub Ali, treasurer Professor Dr Jahangir Alam and treasurer of Jashore University of Science and Technology Professor Dr Hossain Al Mamun.\n\nSM Rashidul Islam, special correspondent of Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), also spoke at the seminar as a discussant.\n\nSource: BSS"
