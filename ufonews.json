        "article_content": "Many of the reported cases of alleged alien encounters, flying saucers, or abductions take place in remote locations, far from the eyes and cameras of almost anyone, or in conditions that make it difficult to see anything clearly. For those who fabricate such experiences, it is a necessary alibi. The case of New Yorker Linda Napolitano, a housewife of Italian descent who said she was abducted by aliens in 1989, generated huge media coverage for exactly the opposite reason: she claimed that a UFO had taken her from her bedroom by means of a tractor beam in the early hours of the morning, in the middle of Manhattan.\n\nTogether with researcher Budd Hopkins, one of the most famous figures in ufology, she brought 23 witnesses to the table who supported her story and said they had seen her fly over the Brooklyn Bridge. The family not only confirmed the veracity of her experiences, but also declared themselves victims of interventions from outer space. And they all stand firm, to the point that Napolitano, who is now 77 years old, has just sued Netflix over a documentary that casts serious doubts on what some media dubbed \u201cthe abduction of the century.\u201d\n\nThe three-episode series, The Manhattan Alien Abduction, was written by Linda Napolitano herself and premiered in the U.S. on October 30, just in time for Halloween. It certainly has terrifying elements, not so much in the dramatizations of the abduction itself, but testimonies such as that of her son, who appears with his face obscured and claims to have been in psychological treatment for years over the trauma of alien visits of which he, who experienced the coverage of the case as a child, is entirely convinced. However, there is another woman who manages to displace Napolitano from the center of the documentary: Carol Rainey, Hopkins\u2019 ex-wife and a notable skeptic of her former husband\u2019s work, especially on the Manhattan case. The basis of the complaint against Netflix is that the participation of Rainey, who died in 2023, is much greater than the aggrieved party expected. Napolitano says she was assured Rainey would make only one appearance, but she is, by all accounts, the co-star.\n\nThe apartment block in Manhattan where Linda Napolitano was allegedly abducted by aliens in 1989. General (\u00a92005 Credit:TopFoto/Fortean)\n\nAs such, The Manhattan Alien Abduction is much more interesting than a mere reconstruction of a 35-year-old UFO file. Its unexpected focus on Rainey allows us to access another story, that of someone who, out of respect for the man she had once loved, for the credibility and objectivity she once had, made the tough decision to disavow him in a shattering publication that questioned his rigor and methodology. \u201cI saw that I was losing objectivity. I loved Budd. He seemed to me to have complete integrity. Completely honest. But if it was a hoax, I needed to know if my husband was complicit,\u201d Rainey states in the documentary. Peter Robbins, Hopkins\u2019 assistant and friend, who blames Rainey for Hopkins\u2019 book Witnessed: The True Story Of The Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions (1996) not being republished or made into a film adaptation, doesn\u2019t see it that way: \u201cHer goal in life was to destroy this man and destroy his reputation.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a harpy,\u201d Napolitano goes so far as to say on camera.\n\nThe housewife\u2019s story contained bizarre elements that went beyond the 1989 abduction. A year later, Napolitano alerted Hopkins that she was being harassed by two men named Dan and Richard, who had witnessed the event from an official car in which they were transporting none other than then-Secretary General of the United Nations Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar. Hopkins, who never saw them himself, gave credence to the letters she received signed in their name and that of the diplomat. According to Napolitano, the men kidnapped her and Dan, who was madly in love with her, ended up in a psychiatric hospital. She also underwent an X-ray test to prove that a lump in her nose was the result of an alien graft. The X-ray revealed that it did appear to house a small cylindrical object, but when she later agreed to undergo surgery to remove it, the object never appeared.\n\nI want to believe\n\nSociologist, writer and editor Pablo Vergel, a contributor to Spanish TV show Cuarto Milenio, which covers mysteries and enigmas, spoke to Napolitano several years ago via Facebook. His intention was to have her participate in a report on the show, although he was unable to get her to appear in front of the cameras. Vergel acknowledges to EL PA\u00cdS that it is \u201ca very problematic case,\u201d which owes its popularity to the context and \u201cthe series of incredible twists and turns that followed, a real soap opera, thanks to which it had a lot of coverage in the tabloid press [...] Iconically, this UFO that lifts someone from their apartment with a ray, takes them out and crosses the most famous skyline in the world, over the Brooklyn Bridge, cannot be more powerful,\u201d he says. In 2021, Vergel published in Spain a book by Budd Hopkins, Intruders, originally from 1987 and one of the key titles in the abduction phenomenon in the United States.\n\nWhitley Strieber photographed in 2016. David Livingston (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cBudd Hopkins is part of the triad of researchers who created the great wave of abductions in the United States, almost a sociological phenomenon, along with Whitley Strieber and John E. Mack,\u201d explains the editor. \u201cHe did have a certain courage; he created support groups for people who said they had been abducted, he established mechanisms and protocols\u2026 Whitley Strieber, the famous author of Communion (1987), turned to Budd Hopkins and said in his book that he helped him a lot in managing his emotional crisis after the traumatic experience he had [his alleged encounter with extraterrestrials]. But at a certain point he began to act like a devotee, like an absolute believer who could not conceive of any alternative explanation. Many people have accused him of having been an evangelist of the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial hypothesis, rather than of investigating it. He abused hypnosis a lot. If you read his books, hypnosis does not follow methodological controls, it leaves suggestion very open. There is even the possibility of ending up implanting memories in the person. Budd Hopkins \u2014 and I say this as his editor \u2014 seems to me to be an interesting author, but also very questionable.\u201d\n\nThe sociologist refers to a study of the Napolitano case published in 1993 by parapsychologist George P. Hansen, together with Joseph J. Stefula and Richard D. Butler, who was critical of Hopkins for not verifying the \u201cvery close\u201d relationship between the housewife and the professional who performed the X-ray test, or the independence of the supposed 23 witnesses to the phenomenon. Among the testimonies that Hopkins had accepted as valid was that of a woman who said she had not been able to see clearly because of the fog \u2014 on a morning when such weather conditions did not occur \u2014 or that of another who, excusing herself on the grounds of her fear, did not close the curtains at her window that night. Hansen and his colleagues found as many as 16 parallels between Napolitano\u2019s story and Garfield Reeves-Stevens\u2019 1989 science fiction novel Nighteyes. They also questioned Hopkins\u2019 honesty, noting that the alleged abductee said he had promised her half the profits from his book about her case.\n\nRobbins, the colleague who backs Hopkins in The Manhattan Alien Abduction, brings up in his statements that Rainey, the researcher\u2019s ex-wife, grew up in a fundamentalist Christian family belonging to the Plymouth Brethren, to suggest that she opposed the extraterrestrial hypothesis because of her religion. Rainey argues in the documentary that, precisely, her experience with Hopkins reopened a wound from the past, when she was estranged from her entire family for questioning the faith: \u201cHis dogma was as radical as my father\u2019s. They both never doubted and seemed to be in possession of the truth. I could not tolerate what he was doing to very vulnerable people,\u201d Rainey said in reference to Hopkins\u2019 hypnosis sessions with people convinced they were being visited by extraterrestrials.\n\nNapolitano, who is said in the series to have had a frustrated vocation as a music star, has called the late Rainey \u201cresentful and alcoholic\u201d in her lawsuit, as well as damaging to her reputation. Nevertheless, The Manhattan Alien Abduction is conciliatory to anyone who really wants to believe her story. Through the theme of faith, the documentary does allow us to glimpse that, among the scholars or mere lovers of the UFO phenomenon, there are those who, with more or less rigor, try to collate their research, and those who only seek to confirm their own beliefs.\n\nDepending on your preferences, the Brooklyn Bridge story generated a previous documentary that completely takes the authenticity of the matter for granted: Linda Napolitano: The Alien Abduction of the Century (2022). Although Napolitano does not participate in it, we are told, based on the thesis of a certain Corrado Malanga, an Italian researcher of the holographic universe, that humans are the most spiritually developed creatures in the universe and that aliens abduct us to imprint their memories in our unconscious, in order to become immortal with our soul.

This works as you might imagine \u2013 you select some text, then fire up the tool which uses generative AI to do what it says on the tin, rewriting those words.\n\nYou get three different rewrites to choose from, and it\u2019s possible to fine-tune the AI\u2019s responses, so you can ask for something longer, for example, or in a different tone.\n\nThis ability is rolling out to testers in the US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, and Italy. As with most of the new features here, it\u2019ll require you to be signed in with a Microsoft account.\n\nNotepad AI rewrite feature\n\nThere\u2019s another non-AI benefit for Notepad here in that the app will launch faster. Microsoft claims that Notepad will open more than 35% more swiftly, with some Windows 11 users seeing a speed boost of 55% or maybe even more. So, Notepad should be considerably nippier when appearing on your desktop.\n\nPainting clever\n\nMoving on to Paint, this core app is getting a feature called \u2018generative fill\u2019 which can be used to easily add an AI-generated element to an image.\n\nThe example Microsoft shows is a person making a landscape who decides they want a castle in the picture. So, they simply select the area where they want it situated, and feed the AI a prompt \u2013 in this case \u2018medieval castle\u2019 \u2013 and Paint goes through its processing for some seconds before the castle appears.\n\nIt\u2019s nice and seamlessly integrated into the landscape, too, although we guess as ever with AI, the results could be variable. If you don\u2019t like what Paint has provided, you can ask it to try again, and generative fill will run once more to deliver a different take on a castle (or whatever it is you want).\n\nMoving from creation to destruction, we have \u2018generative erase\u2019 also inbound for Paint. This lets you highlight an element in an image \u2013 a person in the foreground for example \u2013 and it\u2019ll be removed, with Paint filling in the empty space left to match the background. Again, it\u2019s clever stuff.\n\nIn this case, you brush over the area to be erased, allowing for a more fine-tuned selection than generative fill where you draw a box.\n\nMS Paint\n\nAnalysis: Copilot+ caveats\n\nThese are some pretty nifty AI-powered abilities with some slight caveats. The main one being that Paint\u2019s generative fill is only going to be available with Copilot+ PCs that have a Snapdragon (Arm) CPU initially. We presume it\u2019ll come to other (non-Arm) Copilot+ PCs soon enough \u2013 but as to whether Windows 11 users with a \u2018normal\u2019 PC will ever get it, that might not be the case (as it may require the beefy NPU which is a requirement for a Copilot+ machine).\n\nAll the other features are coming to non-Copilot+ devices, mind, but there\u2019s another bonus here for Copilot+ PC owners. This is that Cocreator in Paint \u2013 which is also exclusive to these Windows 11 devices, and creates AI-generated images from scratch \u2013 has been made faster, with fine-tuning to its \u201cunderlying diffusion-based model\u201d as Microsoft explains. So, everything you do with Cocreator should happen more swiftly.\n\nThe other potential catch, we guess, is that this is more fuel to the fire of discontent for some users who think that Notepad is getting beefed up too much with features \u2013 those folks would no doubt say bloated \u2013 and that this is at odds with its core philosophy . That said, at least the freshly introduced sizeable performance boost for booting the app will go down well.\n\nAll of these features are still in early testing, as noted, so it could be some time before they hit PCs running the release version of Windows 11. Microsoft sounds like it\u2019s being cautious with the rollout in testing, as it\u2019s going to \u201cmonitor feedback and see how it lands\u201d before pushing these updates to more Windows Insiders. Even if you\u2019re a tester, then, you may not see these new features for a while yet.\n\nYou may also like..."

        "article_content": "Anthropic has been gaining on arch rival OpenAI in recent months, according to data from a popular developer tool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI SDK is a toolkit that helps developers build AI-powered applications. It provides code libraries that developers install to get their apps to communicate with different AI models. Data is publishes showing how many times these code packages are downloaded each week.\n\nThis is a useful window into how popular the top AI models are with developers, a key constituency of early tech adopters.\n\nThe data shows that OpenAI remains in the lead. However, Anthropic has been growing faster lately in terms of developer mindshare.\n\nIn the week of August 18, the OpenAI code library was downloaded almost 229,000 times by developers. The equivalent Anthropic library was downloaded almost 38,000 times, according to the data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late October, OpenAI downloads had remained relatively unchanged, while Anthropic downloads were much higher: about 244,000 for OpenAI and 100,000 for Anthropic.\n\nData from NPM Trends NPM Trends\n\nThe recent adoption trends can be partly explained by a new AI model that Anthropic released in the summer.\n\n\"Anthropic's recent gains can be attributed to their Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, which, among many tasks, excels at understanding and generating code,\" said Jared Palmer, VP of AI at Vercel, a startup that offers the AI SDK and other developer tools. \"Its combination of speed, cost, and output quality has won over the developer community for the time being.\"\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet came out in June, and it has been particularly useful for tasks that developers need to do regularly, such as understanding and generating software code.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, OpenAI has maintained its lead among developers, according to the data. That's primarily due to its first-mover advantage and other factors such as cheap pricing of its GPT-4o-mini AI model and strong developer tooling and documentation.\n\nThere's also pretty widespread adoption of their API, or application programming interface. This is a common way for different software applications to communicate and share data.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that OpenAI's lead is slightly inflated by the download data. That's because many AI model providers have adopted OpenAI's API specification as a de facto standard. That allows developers to use the same OpenAI code library package but point their apps to different models.\n\nIt's hard to quantify how much this exaggerates OpenAI's lead, but it also supports the general conclusion that Anthropic has been gaining on its main rival in recent months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said usage of the startup's API has doubled since it released its GPT-4o mini AI model in July. OpenAI has also tripled the number of active apps running in production on its platform in the past year.\n\nThe OpenAI spokesperson shared a critique of the NPM data, saying downloads of these code libraries are not technically an accurate representation of developer audience since it doesn't reflect actual usage or spending.\n\nAnthropic had no problem with the data and what it shows. The company said its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model helps developers handle complex software architecture and multi-step processes. It also noted that enterprises are increasingly adopting Claude for business-critical functions where accuracy is key, such as software development and data analysis.\n\n\"Our new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model is the ideal choice for developers to build AI-powered applications with state-of-the-art performance across the board, including coding, complex financial analysis, and live chat support,\" Dianne Penn, product lead at Anthropic, told Business Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenn cited DoorDash, Sourcegraph, and GitLab as companies that are using Claude to reduce development time, increase code acceptance rates, and build AI features."

The study ranked counties and local authorities based on reports of paranormal activity per square mile, creating a \"paranormal activity score\" to determine the most supernaturally dense areas in the UK. This approach highlights where ghostly encounters are most concentrated.\n\nSo which town is officially the most haunted with a Paranormal Activity Score of 100 and 43 reported paranormal activities and haunted locations all concentrated in just 15 square miles? The would be Ipswich. The Ancient House is known for ghostly monk sightings and mysterious footsteps, while Christchurch Mansion is home to the ghost of a young Victorian maid. The Ipswich Museum, with reported sightings of a phantom Edwardian lady, offers a cultural twist to ghostly encounters.\n\nAlex Wilson, CEO and founder of Affordable Urns, said: \"Our research reveals some exciting destinations for paranormal enthusiasts. The high concentration of reported hauntings in these areas speaks to the rich history and enduring legends of the UK. While we encourage people to explore these fascinating locations, we also urge visitors to approach them with respect and caution. Many of these sites have historical significance and may have restricted access. Always ensure you have proper permission before visiting and follow all safety guidelines.

Pompeii and Herculaneum were two settlements wiped off the face of the Earth and buried under pyroclastic surges, with left victims frozen in suspended actions as they instantly died.\n\nTo this day the death toll remains unknown, with 20,000 people living in both cities. So far, remains of more than 1,500 people have been found across the two locations.\n\nAfter the ruins of Pompeii were excavated, with it now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the desperate remains of people caught up in the eruption were found by archeologists.\n\nAdvert\n\nCast of a man with a child, both of whom died in Pompeii (Marilla Sicilia/Archivio Marilla Sicilia/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images)\n\nObservers who look at such remains see the final moments and stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.\n\nBut new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem, and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.\n\n\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d\n\nMs Mittnik and her colleagues carried out tests on 14 casts of victims found in Pompeii's ruins, where they found that they had been wrongly identified.\n\nIt wasn't just people who perished in the eruption (Ivan Romano/Getty Images)\n\nInstead of being family, one cast of a man holding a child found that the youngster was unrelated to the person assumed to be their parent. This discovery was found in a location known as 'the house of the golden bracelet'; named after an intricate piece of jewellery, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd at least one of the two people locked in an embrace, long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter, was a man. Their research was published on Thursday in the journal Current Biology.\n\nLong thought to be a sister with their mother or daughter, the other person was in fact a man (Archaeological Park of Pompeii)\n\nThe study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.\n\n\u201cThey have a better overview of what\u2019s happening in Pompeii because they analysed different samples,\u201d said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cWe actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\u201d"

Despite the Bengals struggles early in the year, I like them to keep things close and potentially win tonight.\n\nBut remember, the FanDuel promo code only rewards your $150 bonus bet if your first wager wins. So play things safe and take Cincinnati Bengals +14.5 alternate spread (-430) to ensure you capitalize on the offer."

        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump now has a 75-day transition period to build out his team before Inauguration Day arrives on Jan. 20. Read more\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump\u2018s impending return to the White House means he\u2019ll want to stand up an entirely new administration from the one that served under President Joe Biden. His team is also pledging that the second won\u2019t look much like the first one Trump established after his 2016 victory.\n\nThe president-elect now has a 75-day transition period to build out his team before Inauguration Day arrives on Jan. 20. One top item on the to-do list: filling around 4,000 government positions with political appointees, people who are specifically tapped for their jobs by Trump\u2019s team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: The latest news and updates following Election Day\n\nThat includes everyone from the secretary of state and other heads of cabinet departments to those selected to serve part time on boards and commissions. Around 1,200 of those presidential appointments require Senate confirmation, which should be easier with the Senate now shifting to Republican control.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump announced his first significant appointment. He named Susie Wiles, the de facto manager of his victorious campaign, as his White House chief of staff, the first woman to hold the influential role.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect:\n\nWhat will the transition look like?\n\nThough the turnover in the new administration will be total, Trump will be familiar with what he needs to accomplish. He built an entirely new administration for his first term and has definite ideas on what to do differently this time.\n\nHe\u2019s already floated some names.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: To win Pennsylvania, Donald Trump did exactly what he needed to in Philly: Improved slightly\n\nTrump said at his victory party early Wednesday that former presidential hopeful and anti-vaccination activist Robert Kennedy Jr. will be tapped to \u201chelp make America healthy again,\u201d adding that \u201cwe\u2019re going to let him go to it.\u201d Ahead of the election, Trump didn\u2019t reject Kennedy\u2019s calls to end fluoridated water. Trump has also pledged to make South African-born Elon Musk, a vocal supporter of the Trump campaign, a secretary of federal \u201ccost-cutting,\u201d and the Tesla CEO has suggested he can find trillions of dollars in government spending to wipe out.\n\nThe transition is not just about filling jobs. Most presidents-elect also receive daily or near-daily intelligence briefings during the transition.\n\nIn 2008, outgoing President George W. Bush personally briefed President-elect Barack Obama on U.S. covert operations. When Trump was preparing to take office in 2016, Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice, briefed Michael Flynn, her designated successor in the new administration. In 2020, Trump\u2019s legal challenges of the election\u2019s results delayed the start of the transition process for weeks, though, and presidential briefings with Biden didn\u2019t begin until Nov. 30.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump won Pa. with more votes than any statewide Republican candidate in history. Here\u2019s how he did it.\n\nWho is helping Trump through the process?\n\nTrump\u2019s transition is being led primarily by friends and family, including Kennedy Jr. and former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, as well as the president-elect\u2019s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and his running mate, JD Vance. Transition co-chairs are Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, Haverford College\u2019s largest donor, and Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who previously led the Small Business Administration during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nLutnick said this year\u2019s operation is \u201cabout as different as possible\u201d from the 2016 effort, which was first led by Chris Christie. After he won eight years ago, Trump fired Christie, tossed out plans the former New Jersey governor had made and gave the job of running the transition to then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Pa. Democrats on what went wrong against Donald Trump and what\u2019s next\n\nAt the start of his first term, Trump assembled an original cabinet that featured some more mainstream Republicans and business leaders who ultimately disappointed, or broke publicly with him, or both. This time, Trump has promised to value loyalty as much as possible \u2014 a philosophy that may ensure he makes picks that are more closely aligned to his ideological beliefs and bombastic professional style.\n\nUnlike the campaign of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump\u2019s team didn\u2019t sign any pre-Election Day transition agreements with the General Services Administration, which essentially acts as the federal government\u2019s landlord. He has therefore already missed deadlines to agree with GSA on logistical matters like office space and tech support and with the White House on access to agencies, including documents, employees, and facilities.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Disappointed voters and organizers in Philadelphia say gender and racial biases contributed to Harris\u2019 loss\n\nNew transition rules\n\nIn 2020, Trump argued that widespread voter fraud \u2014 which hadn\u2019t actually occurred \u2014 cost him the election, delaying the start of the transition from his outgoing administration to Biden\u2019s incoming one for weeks.\n\nFour years ago, the Trump-appointed head of the GSA, Emily Murphy, determined that she had no legal standing to determine a winner in the presidential race because Trump was still challenging the results in court. That held up funding and cooperation for the transition.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump\u2019s win touches off a mix of celebration and trepidation in the Philly region\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Trump\u2019s efforts to subvert election results had collapsed across key states that Murphy agreed to formally \u201cascertain a president-elect\u201d and begin the transition process. Trump eventually posted on social media that his administration would cooperate.\n\nTo prevent that kind of holdup in future transitions, the Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 mandates that the transition process begin five days after the election \u2014 even if the winner is still in dispute. That is designed to avoid long delays and means that \u201can \u2018affirmative ascertainment\u2019 by the GSA is no longer a prerequisite for gaining transition support services,\u201d according to agency guidelines on the new rules.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump\u2019s growing support among Latino voters helped him clinch battleground Pennsylvania\n\nThe uncertainty stretched even longer after the 2000 election, when five weeks elapsed before the Supreme Court settled the contested election between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. That left Bush with about half the usual amount of time to manage transitioning the government from the outgoing Clinton administration. That ultimately led to questions about national security gaps that may have contributed to the U.S. being underprepared for the Sept. 11 attacks the following year."
