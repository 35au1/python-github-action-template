            "article_content": "If you gotta go fast, you probably don't want to be a stubby-legged spearman who climbs every ladder like a geriatric walrus. Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.\n\nBarbuta itself was completed in 4 minutes 55 seconds by player \"GrayGooGlitch\". It's only 11 seconds short of the fastest existing run. The unrepentantly obscure game is full of old-school trickery, like specific pools of toxic slime that won't hurt you, walls that secretly lack collision, and spike pitfalls with invisible bridges. But it's the randomly fluttering bats that give players the most trouble, as they did here just moments into the run.\n\nBut the UFO 50 marathon was also a team effort. Three other players zipped through their own game choices in the allotted time, swapping the controller just like in the good old days of losing a life to a hateful chicken. The next game was Rakshasa, a tough-as-old-boots action game with lots of upsetting frogs. The runner polished it off in 8 minutes and 22 seconds. Then came Night Manor, a point and click horror game with a ton of classical item puzzling but with a killer that follows you through the rooms and will come hunting you if you make noise by doing certain actions like activating a jukebox. They got through that in 6 minutes 20 seconds.\n\nFinally, it was Warptank, a kind of anti-platformer about a nippy space tank that can't jump but can teleblorp to the surface immediately above it. When I played it for our UFO 50 review, each screen was both a fight with the pixel enemies and a puzzle to figure out. When runner \"SpootyBiscuit\" plays, he turns it into a rhythmic waltz of warping, sparking off forty-five degree angles and blasting troublesome worms with ease. It was the toughest game to get through, with a time of 28 minutes 27 seconds.\n\nOverall, it's a nifty showcase of the retro-styled games contained within UFO 50, all of which contain some twist inspired by modern game design. Awesome Games Done Quick began at the weekend and runs until this Sunday. Other recent speedruns include a blast through Rain World: Downpour, but we're still waiting on the player who intends to beat Elden Ring bosses with nothing but his saxophone and a jazzy attitude. That's happening on Thursday. I look forward to it."

            "article_content": "Nick Drake\u2019s unlikely connection to the cult sci-fi TV show \u2018UFO\u2019\n\nIn April of 1969, Nick Drake\u2014still a couple of months shy of his 21st birthday\u2014was toiling away at Sound Techniques studio in London, wrapping up the final recording session for his debut album, Five Leaves Left. At the same time, about 15 miles away at the MGM film studios in Borehamwood, Nick\u2019s older sister Gabrielle Drake, 25, had just started principal photography on the biggest acting gig of her career\u2014a new live-action science fiction series called UFO, produced by the creators of the beloved marionette TV shows Thunderbirds and Stingray.\n\nMore than half a century later, Fives Leaves Left and UFO each have considerably more fans and cultural relevance than they ever did in their own time. Even the term \u201ccult classic\u201d might be underselling them at this point. Nick Drake, of course, posthumously became one of Britain\u2019s most revered and influential singer/songwriters, while UFO\u2014despite running for just one series between 1970 and \u201971\u2014has gradually built a devoted following nearly on par with that of other iconic TV hits of its era like The Avengers and The Prisoner.\n\nThis makes it all the more bizarre to realise that the Drake siblings likely came home for Christmas in 1969, believing that their big projects\u2014one set in pastoral England and one in futuristic outer space\u2014had both failed.\n\nNick\u2019s debut folk album had disappointingly flopped in the summer after a head-scratching lack of promotion from his label, Island Records. Gabrielle, meanwhile, dropped out of her role on UFO before a single episode had even aired. MGM\u2019s British studios had closed down in the middle of production, forcing a long filming hiatus that she felt would conflict too much with other opportunities.\n\nGabrielle did eventually opt to return and continue playing Lieutenant Gay Ellis for a few more shoots in 1970, but despite her prominent role in the show\u2019s cast, she only wound up appearing in about half of UFO\u2019s 26 episodes. Her character, a purple-wigged moonbase commander in a tight silver catsuit, hadn\u2019t exactly felt like the role of a lifetime anyway. For better or worse, though, it\u2019s probably the one she\u2019s still best remembered for.\n\n\u201cIn a funny way, I feel more pleased to have done it in retrospect than at the time,\u201d Gabrielle Drake later acknowledged at a UFO fan convention in the year 2000, \u201cBecause I do think that it was actually a fairly innovative series and something which was perhaps a bit ahead of its time. It\u2019s very good to look back and to have been associated with it.\u201d\n\nIn the same way that her brother Nick had a capable hand at the wheel in the form of producer Joe Boyd, Gabrielle Drake also benefited from the guidance of UFO series producer Gerry Anderson, one of the legends of early sci-fi television. At the time, Anderson\u2019s background was more in kids TV and marionettes than live-action work with full-size humans, but Gabrielle remembered him as \u201ca very benevolent presence\u201d and someone \u201cyou always felt that you could go up and see at any time. . . . And very easy to get on with, always.\u201d\n\nDespite Anderson\u2019s credentials, though, Drake admitted that she never believed at the time, \u201cnot for one moment,\u201d that the cheap space show she was making would still be remembered or talked about by anybody in the 21st century. \u201cBut then you never do think that in our business,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is such a strange old business, too, because the one thing you think is going to be a surefire hit is bound to flop.\u201d\n\nSadly, we don\u2019t know if Nick Drake ever visited his sister on set or even if he ever bothered to watch a single episode of UFO (it\u2019s strangely difficult to imagine him watching any TV show). As those episodes were finally airing on British televisions in 1970 and \u201871, Nick was mostly hard at work recording and releasing his second album, Bryter Layter, which he believed would be a surefire success, but once again flopped, not to be properly appreciated until decades later. Such is the strange old world of show business."

            "article_content": "Apple will soon push an update to iOS that more clearly denotes when notifications have been summarized by its Apple Intelligence software. The company has received significant pushback over the summarization feature, especially from the BBC, which has complained that the AI technology inaccurately summarized its news notifications.\n\nBack in December, not long after Apple rolled out some of the first major features of Apple Intelligence, the BBC wrote in an article that the AI had erroneously summarized a series of notifications from its app to say that Luigi Mangione, the alleged murderer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself when in fact he had not.\n\nThe BBC said that the error could hurt trust in a media industry that is already suffering from a lack of confidence from the general public.\n\nAfter several weeks, Apple finally responded to the BBC to say that it would be addressing the issue.\n\n\u201cA software update in the coming weeks will further clarify when the text being displayed is summarization provided by Apple Intelligence,\u201d the company told the BBC. \u201cWe encourage users to report a concern if they view an unexpected notification summary.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how Apple will clarify to users when a notification has been summarized. As it functions today, an app\u2019s official icon is displayed next to the summaries. Perhaps when iOS does summarize a notification, it should replace the official icon\u2014in this case for the BBC app\u2014 with the icon for Siri instead, to make the distinction clear. That may not even necessarily be enough, though. How often might a novice user read these summarized notifications and not understand what is going on?\n\nThe point of notification summaries is to rewrite multiple notifications from an app into one single alert so that users can quickly get up to speed and identify anything that needs attention. But besides blatant errors, AI summaries have also been the subject of mockery over sometimes awkward or useless summaries devoid of necessary context that still require reading the full notifications to understand. If users do not trust the summaries and have to review the complete notifications anyway, they are not saving any time. It is the same issue that befell Siri before it: The voice assistant failed at basical queries and users quickly lost faith they could rely on it for much of anything besides starting a timer.\n\nai summaries be like pic.twitter.com/KbmRecoU06 \u2014 Devin Lewtan (@DevinLewtan) January 4, 2025\n\nApple has been criticized for its debut of Apple Intelligence, with sentiment across social media suggesting that many people find the initial features largely useless or harmful to the iOS experience. In December, the company added support for ChatGPT in Siri, meaning some more queries are now kicked over to the OpenAI chatbot to answer. Apple is expected to beef up Siri itself with conversational AI abilities, but recent reports suggest that will take time. It also intends to add other AI features to iOS, including the ability for Siri to interface with apps directly allowing users to, for instance, ask the assistant to find a dinner reservation in their email.\n\nThe driver for Apple releasing Apple Intelligence is clearly out of a need to juice iPhone upgrades; the smartphone accounts for more than half of Apple\u2019s revenue, and Apple Intelligence is only available on the iPhone 15 Pro and above. But most of the features released thus far have been underwhelming\u2014like the ability to identify real-world objects by pointing the camera at them\u2014and recent surveys suggest consumers are not buying new iPhones to get them.\n\nIt should be no surprise to anyone who has interacted with generative AI that these problems were going to occur. But it seems uncharacteristic of Apple to incorporate technology into its products like generative AI, which is notoriously hard to control and prone to hallucinating or producing outputs that are flat-out wrong. For a company that cares so much about polish, this is a mess so far."

Learn More\n\nNvidia unveiled generative AI models and blueprints that expand Nvidia Omniverse integration further into physical AI applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles and vision AI.\n\nAs part of the CES 2025 opening keynote by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the company said global leaders in software development and professional services are using Omniverse to develop new products and services that will accelerate the next era of industrial AI.\n\nAccenture, Altair, Ansys, Cadence, Foretellix, Microsoft and Neural Concept are among the first to integrate Omniverse into their next-generation software products and professional services. Siemens, a leader in industrial automation, announced today at the CES trade show the availability of Teamcenter Digital Reality Viewer \u2014 the first Siemens Xcelerator application powered by Nvidia Omniverse libraries.\n\n\u201cPhysical AI will revolutionize the $50 trillion manufacturing and logistics industries. Everything that moves \u2014 from cars and trucks to factories and warehouses \u2014 will be robotic and embodied by AI,\u201d said Huang, in a statement. \u201cNvidia\u2019s Omniverse digital twin operating system and Cosmos physical AI serve as the foundational libraries for digitalizing the world\u2019s physical industries.\u201d\n\nNew Models and frameworks accelerate world building for physical AI\n\nCreating 3D worlds for physical AI simulation requires three steps: world-building, labeling\n\nthe world with physical attributes and making it photoreal.\n\nNvidia offers generative AI models that accelerate each step. The USD Code and USD Search Nvidia NIM microservices are now generally available, letting developers use text prompts to generate or search for OpenUSD assets. A new Nvidia Edify SimReady generative AI model unveiled today can automatically label existing 3D assets with attributes like physics or materials, enabling developers to process 1,000 3D objects in minutes instead of over 40 hours manually.\n\nNvidia Omniverse, paired with new Nvidia Cosmos world foundation models, creates a synthetic data multiplication engine \u2014 letting developers easily generate massive amounts of controllable, photoreal synthetic data. Developers can compose 3D scenarios in Omniverse and render images or videos as outputs. These can then be used with text prompts to condition Cosmos models to generate countless synthetic virtual environments for physical AI training.\n\nNvidia Omniverse blueprints speed up industrial, robotic workflows\n\nCosmos generates synthetic driving data.\n\nDuring the CES keynote, Nvidia also announced four new blueprints that make it easier for developers to build Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)-based Omniverse digital twins for physical AI. The blueprints include:\n\nMega, powered by Omniverse Sensor RTX APIs, for developing and testing robot fleets at scale in an industrial factory or warehouse digital twin before deployment in real-world facilities.\n\nAutonomous Vehicle (AV) Simulation, also powered by Omniverse Sensor RTX APIs, that lets AV developers replay driving data, generate new ground-truth data and perform closed-loop testing to accelerate their development pipelines.\n\nOmniverse Spatial Streaming to Apple Vision Pro that helps developers create applications for immersive streaming of large-scale industrial digital twins to Apple Vision Pro.\n\nReal-Time Digital Twins for Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), a reference workflow built on NVIDIA CUDA-X acceleration, physics AI and Omniverse libraries that enables real-time physics visualization.\n\nNew free, Learn OpenUSD courses are also now available to help developers build OpenUSD-based worlds faster than ever.\n\nMarket Leaders Supercharge Industrial AI Using NVIDIA Omniverse\n\nGlobal leaders in software development and professional services are using Omniverse to develop new products and services that are poised to accelerate the next era of industrial AI.\n\nBuilding on its adoption of Omniverse libraries in its Reality Digital Twin data center digital twin platform, Cadence, a leader in electronic systems design, announced further integration of Omniverse into Allegro, its leading electronic computer-aided design application used by the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies.\n\nAltair, a leader in computational intelligence, is adopting the Omniverse blueprint for real-time CAE digital twins for interactive computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Ansys is adopting Omniverse into Ansys Fluent, a leading CAE application. And Neural Concept is integrating Omniverse libraries into its next-generation software products, enabling real-time CFD and enhancing engineering workflows.\n\nAccenture, a leading global professional services company, is using Mega to help German supply chain solutions leader KION by building next-generation autonomous warehouses and robotic fleets for their network of global warehousing and distribution customers.\n\nAV toolchain provider Foretellix, a leader in data-driven autonomy development, is using the AV Simulation blueprint to enable full 3D sensor simulation for optimized AV testing and validation. Research organization MITRE is also deploying the blueprint, in collaboration with the University of Michigan\u2019s Mcity testing facility, to create an industry-wide AV validation platform.\n\nKatana Studio is using the Omniverse spatial streaming workflow to create custom car configurators for Nissan and Volkswagen, allowing them to design and review car models in an imersive experience while improving the customer decision-making process.\n\nInnoactive, an XR streaming platform for enterprises, leveraged the workflow to add platform support for spatial streaming to Apple Vision Pro. The solution enables Volkswagen Group to conduct design and engineering project reviews at human-eye resolution. Innoactive also collaborated with Syntegon, a provider of processing and packaging technology solutions for pharmaceutical production, to enable Syntegon\u2019s customers to walk through and review digital twins of custom installations before they are\n\nbuilt."

            "article_content": "panida wijitpanya/Istockphoto\n\nTop 10 Psychic and Medium Related TV Shows\n\nIs there life after death? TV shows about mediums, who have the intuitive gift of being able to psychically connect with the deceased, have become increasingly popular, as more people open up to the belief that spirits do live on after death.\n\nAs studies have shown communication with those who have passed away is possible, it\u2019s not surprising that more people are seeking mediumship services on popular psychic platforms.\n\nTurn these shows into reality by connecting with your medium through one of these trusted online psychic reading sites.\n\nNew York Live/Youtube\n\n1. The Long Island Medium\n\nThe Long Island Medium stars Theresa Caputo, who is known for walking right up to strangers to pass along messages from departed loved ones. From the grocery store to restaurants, Caputo is attuned to the spiritual realm and in service to bridging the realms of the living and deceased. The spontaneity of her approach leads to candid responses of those who are on the receiving end of the information she is sharing. (Although some of the best online psychic readings can be just as interesting and revealing!)\n\nCaputo has become one of the most well-known reality TV psychics. Due to the popularity of this show, TLC produced 14 seasons between 2011 and 2019. The high-energy and unconventional approach of Caputo makes this show top-notch entertainment.\n\nE! Entertainment/ Youtube\n\n2. Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry\n\nHollywood Medium with Tyler Henry chronicles the readings of clairvoyant medium Tyler Henry Koelewyn, who discovered his intuitive gifts at age 10. He started filming this TV series in 2016, when he was only 19 years old. Tyler Henry\u2019s popularity grew after he appeared on Keeping Up with the Kardashians to do a mediumship reading for the sisters. E! offered Tyler Henry the opportunity to do his own show. It was a hit from the get-go, and ended up running for 4 seasons until 2019.\n\nThe show documents Tyler Henry doing readings for A-List celebrities, such as Carmen Electra, Chad Michael Murray, Megan Fox, Bobby Brown, Kristin Cavallari, and many more. What\u2019s unique about this show is the glimpse it offers into celebrities\u2019 personal lives as they open up about their deceased loved ones.\n\nLifetime/Youtube\n\n3. Seatbelt Psychic\n\nRiffing off popular shows such as Cash Cab and Carpool Karaoke, Seatbelt Psychic features medium Thomas John picking up strangers and relaying messages from departed loved ones. John\u2019s goal is to touch the lives of as many people as possible, trusting he\u2019ll cross paths with the people he\u2019s meant to meet, so this on-the-move show is perfect for his mission.\n\nUnfortunately, it only aired one season in 2018 on Lifetime before being canceled. However, the unscripted nature of the show has gone a long way in convincing skeptics and nonbelievers of the validity of mediumship messages. John\u2019s personal messages are often exactly what his passengers needed to hear to gain clarity and release. If you\u2019re curious whether a loved one on the other side might have something to say to you, the personal face-to-face mediumship readings on Keen are a great way to find out.\n\nA&E/Youtube\n\n4. Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal\n\nChildren tend to have a stronger connection to the other side, hence imaginary friends and seeing things in the closet adults can\u2019t. Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal explores the unique abilities of children with reported psychic ability and connects them with adult psychic mediums to help cultivate their gifts.\n\nThis show ran on A&E for three seasons from 2008 to 2010 and then had a reboot season in 2019. What sets this show apart from others is the special focus on psychically gifted children. Plus, all hosts of the show, Chip Coffey, Chris Flemming, and Kim Russo, are well-known in the paranormal scene. The fourth host, Edy Nathan is a licensed therapist, who ensures the children are integrating and processing their experiences in a healthy way. For anyone who\u2019s ever had to comfort a child who thinks they\u2019ve seen something in the dark, this is a great show to learn from.\n\nChalabala/Istockphoto\n\n5. Pet Psychic\n\nPets quickly become valued family members, and their passing is often just as painful. The Pet Psychic features medium Sonya Fitzpatrick telepathically communicating with animals. From cats and dogs to horses and birds, Fitzpatrick uses her special gift to share messages with pet owners. (And some of the best online psychic readings can also help you connect with your furry friends.)\n\nThis show ran for three seasons from 2002 to 2004 on Animal Planet. What was unique about this show is that she\u2019s not only communicating with deceased pets but also speaking with living animals to help them with emotional trauma and behavioral problems. If this sounds interesting, consider a reading with an expert pet psychic about your own beloved animal.\n\nPrime videos\n\n6. America\u2019s Psychic Challenge\n\nAmerica\u2019s Psychic Challenge is a game show in which four contestants compete to see who is America\u2019s top psychic. In this exciting show, contestants must go through a series of tests to prove their psychic abilities. One challenge is finding a man hidden in the trunk of one car out of 50, while another requires them to correctly match five brides and five grooms.\n\nLifetime only produced one season of this show back in 2007, but there\u2019s also Britain's Psychic Challenge to watch if you like this one. This show is fun and a good start for nonbelievers to see the feats psychics are capable of.\n\nIMDb\n\n7. Rescue Medium\n\nRescue Medium showcases international psychics Jackie Dennison and Christine Hamlett in seasons 1 through 3 and Alison Wynne-Ryder in seasons 4 through 7 as they help to guide lost spirits to the next realm. In the show, the psychics make house calls to ask spirits to leave haunted locations. Plenty of paranormal encounters occur throughout the seasons, including possessions, poltergeists, and ghosts that need to be dealt with.\n\nThis show aired on Canada\u2019s W Network from 2006 to 2011, but different seasons have also aired on WE: Women\u2019s Entertainment Network in the United States and Discovery Channel and CBS in the U.K. For those who want to see psychics handle a spooky paranormal activity, Rescue Medium gives an up-close look at real-life ghostbusting.\n\nIMDb\n\n8. Psychic Investigators\n\nWhen cases get cold, sometimes it requires psychic investigation to solve the mystery. Psychic Investigators is a true-crime series in which psychics help to find missing clues, discover new leads, and figure out what really happened at the scene of the crime. Like many other popular true-crime shows, Psychic Investigators draws viewers in with dramatic reconstruction, intriguing crime details, and interviews with key characters.\n\nThis series aired on the True Crime Network from 2006 to 2008. From solving cold case murders from 30 years earlier to locating missing persons, this is the ultimate psychic show to satisfy the detective within.\n\nIMDb\n\n9. Ghost Whisperer\n\nGhost Whisperer, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, is a supernatural television series about Melinda Gordon, who can speak with earthbound spirits. These spirits need Gordon\u2019s help in order to move on, and she must use her mediumship abilities to relay important information to the living. However, the messages she receives are often confusing, so she must piece together the clues to understand the spirits\u2019 needs.\n\nThe five seasons of this show were aired on CBS from 2006 through 2010. Although it\u2019s a fictional series, Ghost Whisperer does a great job depicting the struggles of mediumship, such as having to decipher unclear communication and carrying the emotional responsibility of imparting significant messages. Love Hewitt does a wonderful job in this role, portraying what it\u2019s like to be a medium with psychic abilities. The show depicts how it can feel more like a curse than a blessing at times to have such unusual gifts.\n\nIMDb\n\n10. Medium\n\nMedium is a paranormal drama about the character Allison DuBois, played by Patricia Arquette, who can speak with the deceased, foresee the future, and witness past events in her dreams. When interning as an assistant for a Phoenix District Attorney, DuBois has a dream about a murder, which leads to the successful solving of the case. The seven seasons are centered on DuBois using her psychic gifts to solve cases, convincing nonbelievers of her gift, and living her life as a wife and mother of three.\n\nThe show had 7 seasons between 2005 and 2011 - the first 5 on NBC, and the rest on CBS. Even though this is a fictional show, it has a fantastic plotline that gives viewers a glimpse into the life of a psychic. DuBois is a relatable character, and it\u2019s rewarding to follow along with her psychic journey.\n\nmiriam-doerr/Istockphoto\n\nExploring the Psychic World\n\nFrom providing guidance in the time of loss or crisis to solving cold-case crimes, these shows demonstrate there\u2019s such a wide range of services that psychics can provide.

            "article_content": "The Western Ghats and Northeast India has always been recognized as biodiversity rich and hotspots in India with multiple discoveries of endemic species from these regions, according to a Mongabay-India (MI) report.\n\nIn 2024 too, multiple species were newly described, most of them reptiles, amphibians or insects. Every new discovery is significant as it potentially redefines the course of science and takes us a step closer to the understanding of biodiversity and its conservation and management, says the MI report.\n\nSome of these new species have been highlighted in the report. The king cobra was long believed to be a single species \u2013 Ophiophagus hannah. The longest venomous snake in the world is not considered to have much conservation significance and is listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened taxa. That is about to change as a global study led by the Western Ghats-based scientist P Gowri Shankar has questioned the belief through a new discovery that the king cobra is not one species, but four distinct species separated by geographies. Among the four, two species are severely threatened, including the Western Ghats species, now named Ophiophagus kaalinga. The latest study findings that king cobra is not one, but four species have implications on both conservation and antivenom research.\n\nWhen the species in question is as common as a lizard, the MI report points out how amphibian researcher Sandeep Das nearly missed identifying a new species because it closely resembled the widely known Agasthyagama bedomii, or northern kangaroo lizard. However, after consulting with other experts, he realised that the location of the sighting \u2013 a hilly district in Idukki, Kerala \u2013 was too far from the typical range of A. bedomii. Further studies confirmed this finding, leading to the discovery of a previously unrecognised species. Named Agasthyagama edge, the authors describe the species as \u201csuperficially similar to Agasthyagama bedomii in overall shape, size and colour but can be distinguished by combination of characters.\n\nThe northeastern parts of India, as diverse in animal and plant species as the Western Ghats, are relatively less studied, primarily due to the mostly hostile terrain and turbulence the region has witnessed historically. Despite these challenges, many researchers have managed to do some intense species studies in the region. For Mongabay India, the year 2024 began with the news of three new frog species \u2014 Gracixalus patkaiensis, Alcalus fontinalis, and Nidirana noadihing \u2014 discovered from the biodiversity hotspot of Kamlang-Namdapha landscape in Arunachal Pradesh. Tucked between Myanmar and India, Namdapha is considered the northernmost limit of the tropical rainforest in the world. Namdapha region, located on the border, faces many anthropogenic pressures that pose conservation challenges. Another reason why these discoveries are special is because those are not just three new species but three new genera \u2013 a taxonomic category comprising species exhibiting similar characteristics \u2013 recorded from India.\n\nThe MI report then adds that in 2017, field entomologist Vivek Sarkar and his assistant Tushar Sangma identified a new cicada species during an acoustic survey in Balpakram National Park, located in South Garo Hills, Meghalaya in 2017, leading to the identification of Becquartina bicolor, the bicolour butterfly cicada. In 2020, Rodeson Thangkhiew \u2013 then a PhD scholar and now an assistant professor of zoology at the University of Science and Technology in Meghalaya \u2013 was drawn to a unique cicada call coming from a tree next to a small stream. His observations would later align with Sarkar\u2019s findings. The two teams published their research in March 2024 in Zootaxa. Sarkar emphasised that the locals in South Garo Hills and Ri Bhoi were already familiar with the bicolour butterfly cicada, underscoring the importance of integrating traditional ecological knowledge from local communities into scientific research.\n\nQuite recently, another MI report while highlighting the importance of dung beetles in maintaining environmental health, also informed about the discovery of new dung beetle species, two of which are from northeast India. One of the important lessons from these new discoveries is the extent of biodiversity the country holds. These new findings have far-reaching impacts on conservation science: every new discovery is a step closer to our understanding of biodiversity and its conservation and management."

            "article_content": "Images taken by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope\n\nAstronomers have achieved a groundbreaking feat after identifying 44 individual stars in a galaxy nearly 6.5 billion light-years away. This remarkable discovery, made possible by NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope and the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, sets a new record for the largest number of individual stars detected in the distant universe. The findings, led by Fengwu Sun, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Astrophysics by Harvard & Smithsonian, and published in Nature Astronomy, open new avenues for studying the universe\u2019s most profound mysteries, including dark matter. Looking for individual stars in galaxies billions of light-years away has long been considered impossible, as these far-flung galaxies typically blur into a diffuse glow.\n\nHowever, a natural magnification effect called gravitational lensing, coupled with JWST\u2019s infrared capabilities, has changed the game, Phys.org reports.\n\nGravitational lensing occurs when a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, bends and amplifies the light of objects behind it. In this case, the cluster Abell 370 acted as a lens, magnifying a galaxy called the Dragon Arc. This effect stretched the Dragon Arc into an elongated shape, making individual stars within it visible to JWST\u2019s sensitive instruments. \u201cWhen we processed the data, we realized that what appeared to be individual star points were actually stars within this distant galaxy,\u201d said Sun. Many of the stars identified in the Dragon Arc are red supergiants, a type of massive star in the final stages of its life. These stars, cooler and more luminous than the blue supergiants often observed in earlier studies, were detectable thanks to JWST\u2019s ability to observe infrared wavelengths. This marks a shift from earlier discoveries with the Hubble Space Telescope, which had identified only a handful of stars in distant galaxies, most of them blue supergiants like Rigel and Deneb. \u201cWe now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously beyond our reach,\u201d said Sun. \u201cThis discovery provides unprecedented insights into stellar populations and their role in galaxy evolution during the early universe.\u201d\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope was able to capture images of individual stars on the Abell 370\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,\u201d the scientist highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow up with Chiron,\n\n\u201cIt will come closer to us, and if we can study it at nearer distances and get better reads on the quantities and nature of the ices, silicates, and organics, we will be able to better understand how seasonal insolation variations and different illumination patterns can affect its behavior and its ice reservoir.\u201d"

            "article_content": "In a post on his personal blog, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he believes OpenAI \u201cknow[s] how to build [artificial general intelligence]\u201d as the company has traditionally understood it, and is beginning to turn its aim to \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe love our current products, but we are here for the glorious future,\u201d Altman wrote in the post. \u201cSuperintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity.\u201d\n\nAltman previously said that superintelligence could be \u201ca few thousand days\u201d away, and that its arrival would be \u201cmore intense than people think.\u201d\n\nAGI, or artificial general intelligence, is a nebulous term, but OpenAI has its own definition: \u201chighly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d OpenAI and Microsoft, the startup\u2019s close collaborator and investor, also have a definition of AGI: AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profits. When OpenAI achieves this, Microsoft will lose access to its technology, per an agreement between the two companies.\n\nSo which definition might Altman be referring to? He didn\u2019t specify, but the former seems likeliest. Altman wrote that he thinks AI agents \u2014 AI systems that can perform certain tasks autonomously \u2014 may \u201cjoin the workforce,\u201d in a manner of speaking, and \u201cmaterially change the output of companies\u201d this year.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s also true that today\u2019s AI technology is significantly limited. It hallucinates, for one; it makes mistakes obvious to any human; and it can be very expensive.\n\nAltman seems confident all this can be overcome \u2014 and quickly. Still, if there\u2019s anything we\u2019ve learned about AI from the past few years, it\u2019s that timelines can shift.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and empowerment, is so important,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201cGiven the possibilities of our work, OpenAI cannot be a normal company. How lucky and humbling it is to be able to play a role in this work.\u201d\n\nOne would hope that as OpenAI telegraphs its shift in focus to what it considers to be superintelligence, the company would devote sufficient resources to ensuring superintelligent systems behave safely.\n\nOpenAI has written several times about how successfully transitioning to a world with superintelligence is \u201cfar from guaranteed,\u201d and that it doesn\u2019t have all the answers. \u201c[W]e don\u2019t have a solution for steering or controlling a potentially superintelligent AI, and preventing it from going rogue,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post dated July 2023. \u201c[H]umans won\u2019t be able to reliably supervise AI systems much smarter than us, and so our current alignment techniques will not scale to superintelligence.\u201d\n\nSince that post, however, OpenAI has disbanded teams that were focused on AI safety, including superintelligent systems safety, and seen several influential safety-focused researchers depart. Several of these staffers cited OpenAI\u2019s increasingly commercial ambitions as the reason for their departure. The company is currently undergoing a corporate restructuring to make it more attractive to outside investors.\n\nAsked in a recent interview about critics who say OpenAI isn\u2019t focused enough on safety, Altman responded, \u201cI\u2019d point to our track record.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

            "article_content": "OpenAI has announced that its primary focus for the coming year will be on developing \u201csuperintelligence,\u201d according to a blog post from Sam Altman. This has been described as AI with greater-than-human capabilities.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s current suite of products has a vast array of capabilities, Altman said that superintelligence will enable users to perform \u201canything else.\u201d He highlights accelerating scientific discovery as the primary example, which, he believes, will lead to the betterment of society.\n\n\u201cThis sounds like science fiction right now, and somewhat crazy to even talk about it. That\u2019s alright\u2014we\u2019ve been there before and we\u2019re OK with being there again,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe change of direction has been spurred by Altman\u2019s confidence in his company now knowing \u201chow to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it.\u201d AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is typically defined as a system that matches human capabilities, whereas superintelligence exceeds them.\n\nSEE: OpenAI\u2019s Sora: Everything You Need to Know\n\nAltman has eyed superintelligence for years \u2014 but concerns exist\n\nOpenAI has been referring to superintelligence for several years when discussing the risks of AI systems and aligning them with human values. In July 2023, OpenAI announced it was hiring researchers to work on containing superintelligent AI.\n\nThe team would reportedly devote 20% of OpenAI\u2019s total computing power to training what they call a human-level automated alignment researcher to keep future AI products in line. Concerns around superintelligent AI stem from how such a system could prove impossible to control and may not share human values.\n\n\u201cWe need scientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us,\u201d wrote OpenAI Head of Alignment Jan Leike and co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever in a blog post at the time.\n\nSEE: OpenAI and Anthropic Sign Deals With U.S. AI Safety Institute\n\nBut, four months after creating the team, another company post revealed they \u201cstill (did) not know how to reliably steer and control superhuman AI systems\u201d and didn\u2019t have a way of \u201cpreventing (a superintelligent AI) from going rogue.\u201d\n\nIn May, OpenAI\u2019s superintelligence safety team was disbanded and several senior personnel left due to the concern that \u201csafety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products,\u201d including Jan Leike and the team\u2019s co-lead Ilya Sutskever. The team\u2019s work was absorbed by OpenAI\u2019s other research efforts, according to Wired.\n\nDespite this, Altman highlighted the importance of safety to OpenAI in his blog post. \u201cWe continue to believe that the best way to make an AI system safe is by iteratively and gradually releasing it into the world, giving society time to adapt and co-evolve with the technology, learning from experience, and continuing to make the technology safer,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the importance of being world leaders on safety and alignment research, and in guiding that research with feedback from real world applications.\u201d\n\nThe path to superintelligence may still be years away\n\nThere is disagreement about how long it will be until superintelligence is achieved. The November 2023 blog post said it could develop within a decade. But nearly a year later, Altman said it could be \u201ca few thousand days away.\u201d\n\nHowever, Brent Smolinski, IBM VP and global head of Technology and Data Strategy, said this was \u201ctotally exaggerated,\u201d in a company post from September 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re even in the right zip code for getting to superintelligence,\u201d he said.\n\nAI still requires much more data than humans to learn a new capability, is limited in the scope of capabilities, and does not possess consciousness or self-awareness, which Smolinski views as a key indicator of superintelligence.\n\nHe also claims that quantum computing could be the only way we might unlock AI that surpasses human intelligence. At the start of the decade, IBM predicted that quantum would begin to solve real business problems before 2030.\n\nSEE: Breakthrough in Quantum Cloud Computing Ensures its Security and Privacy\n\nAltman predicts AI agents will join the workforce in 2025\n\nAI agents are semi-autonomous generative AI that can chain together or interact with applications to carry out instructions or make decisions in an unstructured environment. For example, Salesforce uses AI agents to call sales leads.\n\nTechRepublic predicted at the end of the year that the use of AI agents will surge in 2025. Altman echoes this in his blog post, saying \u201cwe may see the first AI agents \u2018join the workforce\u2019 and materially change the output of companies.\u201d\n\nSEE: IBM: Enterprise IT Facing Imminent AI Agent Revolution\n\nAccording to a research paper by Gartner, the first industry agents to dominate will be software development. \u201cExisting AI coding assistants gain maturity, and AI agents provide the next set of incremental benefits,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nBy 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, according to the Gartner paper. A fifth of online store interactions and at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be conducted by agents by that year.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to superintelligence in the true sense of the word,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and empowerment, is so important.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The Webb Space Telescope captured a record-breaking image of stars in the Dragon Arc, a serpentine crescent of a galaxy in the distant universe.\n\nThe galaxy is a whopping 6.5 billion light-years from Earth and Webb\u2019s recent snapshot of it captures 44 individual stars, seen thanks to the telescope\u2019s remarkable capabilities and the fortuitous layout of objects between the telescope and the galaxy. Let us explain.\n\nThe Dragon Arc is just that\u2014a bent strip of light in space\u2014because its light is flattened by the gravity of intervening objects. Those intervening objects are gravitational lenses, which bend and refocus the light from more distant objects, magnifying them to an observer (in this case, the Webb Space Telescope).\n\nLens within a lens\n\nIn a recent study, a group of astronomers scrutinized Webb observations of a galaxy cluster and well-known gravitational lens known as Abell 370. The cluster magnified the distant stars by approximately 100 times, and a star within the cluster acted as a lens within that lens, making the distant stars come into sharper relief. The team\u2019s research describing the target stars was published this week in Nature Astronomy.\n\n\u201cInside the galaxy cluster, there are many stars floating around that are not bound by any galaxy,\u201d said Eiichi Egami, a research professor at Steward Observatory and co-author of the paper, in an Arizona State University release. \u201cWhen one of them happens to pass in front of the background star in the distant galaxy along the line of sight with Earth, it acts as a microlens, in addition to the microlensing effect of the galaxy cluster as a whole.\u201d\n\nNew possibilities\n\nThe lensception, if you will, made it possible for the research team to pick out individual stars which otherwise would have been too fuzzy to make out. The team studied the stars and concluded that \u201cmany of them are consistent with red giants or supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds,\u201d as the group wrote in the paper.\n\n\u201cThis groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\u201d said Fengwu Sun, a researcher at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, in the release.\n\nSuch red stars are nearing the end of their lives. As the stars use up their fuel, they swell and offload reams of gas and dust. Webb is no stranger to such ancient stars; in 2022 and 2023, the state-of-the-art observatory trained its eye on Earendel, the most distant known star, and found signs that the ancient ball of gas may have a partner in crime.\n\nDiscovering a single distant star is remarkable on its own. In November 2024, astronomers captured the first detailed image of a star outside our galaxy\u2014a red supergiant in its final stages of life. But a whole collection of stars is more scientifically useful. As the team wrote, the work demonstrates that \u201cobservations by the Webb Space Telescope could lead to the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.\u201d\n\nAstronomers will conduct follow-up observations of the arc with the Webb telescope, which are expected to reveal more of the magnified stars within the distorted galaxy. Besides helping scientists understand how different gravitational lenses magnify ancient light, the findings could reveal aspects of dark matter."

            "article_content": "The Western Ghats and Northeast India has always been recognized as biodiversity rich and hotspots in India with multiple discoveries of endemic species from these regions, according to a Mongabay-India (MI) report.\n\nIn 2024 too, multiple species were newly described, most of them reptiles, amphibians or insects. Every new discovery is significant as it potentially redefines the course of science and takes us a step closer to the understanding of biodiversity and its conservation and management, says the MI report.\n\nSome of these new species have been highlighted in the report. The king cobra was long believed to be a single species \u2013 Ophiophagus hannah. The longest venomous snake in the world is not considered to have much conservation significance and is listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened taxa. That is about to change as a global study led by the Western Ghats-based scientist P Gowri Shankar has questioned the belief through a new discovery that the king cobra is not one species, but four distinct species separated by geographies. Among the four, two species are severely threatened, including the Western Ghats species, now named Ophiophagus kaalinga. The latest study findings that king cobra is not one, but four species have implications on both conservation and antivenom research.\n\nWhen the species in question is as common as a lizard, the MI report points out how amphibian researcher Sandeep Das nearly missed identifying a new species because it closely resembled the widely known Agasthyagama bedomii, or northern kangaroo lizard. However, after consulting with other experts, he realised that the location of the sighting \u2013 a hilly district in Idukki, Kerala \u2013 was too far from the typical range of A. bedomii. Further studies confirmed this finding, leading to the discovery of a previously unrecognised species. Named Agasthyagama edge, the authors describe the species as \u201csuperficially similar to Agasthyagama bedomii in overall shape, size and colour but can be distinguished by combination of characters.\n\nThe northeastern parts of India, as diverse in animal and plant species as the Western Ghats, are relatively less studied, primarily due to the mostly hostile terrain and turbulence the region has witnessed historically. Despite these challenges, many researchers have managed to do some intense species studies in the region. For Mongabay India, the year 2024 began with the news of three new frog species \u2014 Gracixalus patkaiensis, Alcalus fontinalis, and Nidirana noadihing \u2014 discovered from the biodiversity hotspot of Kamlang-Namdapha landscape in Arunachal Pradesh. Tucked between Myanmar and India, Namdapha is considered the northernmost limit of the tropical rainforest in the world. Namdapha region, located on the border, faces many anthropogenic pressures that pose conservation challenges. Another reason why these discoveries are special is because those are not just three new species but three new genera \u2013 a taxonomic category comprising species exhibiting similar characteristics \u2013 recorded from India.\n\nThe MI report then adds that in 2017, field entomologist Vivek Sarkar and his assistant Tushar Sangma identified a new cicada species during an acoustic survey in Balpakram National Park, located in South Garo Hills, Meghalaya in 2017, leading to the identification of Becquartina bicolor, the bicolour butterfly cicada. In 2020, Rodeson Thangkhiew \u2013 then a PhD scholar and now an assistant professor of zoology at the University of Science and Technology in Meghalaya \u2013 was drawn to a unique cicada call coming from a tree next to a small stream. His observations would later align with Sarkar\u2019s findings. The two teams published their research in March 2024 in Zootaxa. Sarkar emphasised that the locals in South Garo Hills and Ri Bhoi were already familiar with the bicolour butterfly cicada, underscoring the importance of integrating traditional ecological knowledge from local communities into scientific research.\n\nQuite recently, another MI report while highlighting the importance of dung beetles in maintaining environmental health, also informed about the discovery of new dung beetle species, two of which are from northeast India. One of the important lessons from these new discoveries is the extent of biodiversity the country holds. These new findings have far-reaching impacts on conservation science: every new discovery is a step closer to our understanding of biodiversity and its conservation and management."

            "article_content": "Construction workers expanding a section of road north of London needed to pause their project after uncovering an unexpected find\u2014a small Roman cemetery dating back roughly 1,500 years. Excavating just one of the coffins in their way was no small feat, either. According to the England\u2019s National Highways department announcement on January 6th, the largely intact stone casket weighed as much as \u201can adult male polar bear.\u201d For those unsure about that exact unit of measurement, that puts the coffin at around 1,650 lbs.\n\n\u201cWhile our main focus has been on building a road to improve journeys for road users, it\u2019s been extremely satisfying to play a part in uncovering such an unusual archaeological find,\u201d said Chris Griffin, the National Highways east region program leader.\n\nThe coffin weighs roughly 1,650 lbs. Credit: National Highways\n\nWhile a sovereign state today, a large portion of the UK once composed the Roman territory of Britannia. Julius Caesar initially invaded the island in 55 and 54 BCE during the Gallic Wars, but it wasn\u2019t until Claudius\u2019 reign that a much larger campaign commenced. Rome officially annexed the province of Britannia in 43 CE before ruling over the region for roughly the next 400 years. This means that locals likely buried the large stone coffin towards the end of Roman occupation following almost a half-century of cultural exchange and improvements made to Britain\u2019s agriculture, architecture, urban planning, and industry. One of the most notable Roman additions to the area was a vast network of roads connecting much of the territory. Despite their immense influence, however, only an estimated 800 Latin words were ultimately incorporated into Common Brittonic by the time of Rome\u2019s withdrawal from the island. The vast majority of the proto-English language remained firmly intertwined with its Germanic origins.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

According to Archeology News, a team of 50 archeologists and 20 civil engineers spent seven months excavating 17 different sites along the roadway. Many of these discoveries will be showcased in the new season of Digging for Britain. The first episode\u2014which includes the polar bear-sized casket\u2014will premiere on BBC 2 on January 7th."

            "article_content": "Crooks start most payments fraud by trying to figure out if the crime is actually worth the effort, sending small probes to see if there is enough money to steal. Stripe contends there is a way to gain the upper hand by leaning on machine learning.\n\nThe payments company says the technology has reduced a type of attack called \"card testing\" by 80% in the past two years. That has come as Stripe's yearly payment volume has grown from about $500 billion to more than $1 trillion during that time, a jump in payments activity that theoretically makes card testing easier.\n\nCrooks use card testing to measure how valuable a stolen card can be by making small phony payments, usually a couple of dollars or less, trying to bury a fraudulent transaction in a sea of legitimate payments, where it's less likely to be noticed.\n\nIf these payments go through without being flagged, the fraudsters then make incrementally larger purchases, relying on the initial \"test\" payments that have beaten a company's fraud guard to pave the way for larger theft.\n\n\"Card testing is where most fraud begins,\" said Emily Sands, head of information at Stripe, where she is responsible for leading a department that develops uses for data in decision-making and automation. \"Bad actors try to get to which cards can be used in the future.\"\n\n\n\nAdministering the exam\n\nCard testing is the most prevalent type of payment fraud, according to Chargebacks 911 .\n\nWhile the losses due to card testing alone are minimal, the technique is a gateway to $205 billion in e-commerce fraud in the first half of the 2020s, according to Juniper Research , which stresses the importance of determining the validity of a payment as key to halting deeper crime.\n\n\"It's a big threat and challenging to detect,\" Sands said. \"Crooks are clever. They hide attacks in businesses that make or receive lots of payments. The record of payments in this case may not look as spiky as for a business or small company. So there's not a sudden shift in the pace of transactions.\"\n\nThere are two major types of card tests. A verification attack involves a crook trying to make small purchases on stolen card accounts to see which ones have been canceled or expired. An enumeration attack, which is gaining steam as crooks use more sophisticated technology, involves \"guessing\" at card numbers in a rapid-fire manner to spot active cards and to circumvent the cards' blocking function.\n\nStripe uses machine learning, or a form of artificial intelligence, to estimate the overall prevalence of card testing on its platform, which enables the company to update its risk systems daily. The payment company additionally uses machine learning to estimate where card testing is likely to be taking place, such as businesses, issuers or a type of purchase or payment. This helps determine if a \"rush\" of transactions are card testing or a spike in payments due to a marketing campaign, for instance.\n\nOther tests include vetting individual transactions to spot signs of card testing. This technology enables Stripe to label breakthroughs, or \"successful\" card tests. That is combined with intelligence from new attack types, analyses that spot fraud patterns and manual reviews. This produces a set of transactions or transaction types that are labeled card-testing fraud, which is then fed into machine-learning models for rapid training using an engineering platform.\n\n\"Crooks are constantly changing methods,\" Sands said. \"Machine learning enables rapid retraining to spot new attack methods. \"This detection adds new features that get fed back into the AI model.\"\n\n\n\nRise of the machines\n\nWhile card testing has existed for years, it has increased over the past few years in concert with the economic crisis that accompanied the Covid-19 pandemic, which also catalyzed a rapid expansion in online payments. That has attracted payment and technology companies to develop products designed to halt the attacks. Verifi sells tools that help merchants adjust credit card authorization response messages, which can combat card testing. It also offers card verification value checks as well as geolocation and biometric analysis. Another Verifi product uses new 3D Secure protocols that are designed for digital commerce. JPMorgan Chase , Kount and Chargebacks 911 also offer services to mitigate card testing fraud.\n\nFirms are increasingly using large language models, or an advanced form of AI that's better at deciphering text, to detect similar intent, word usage and patterns in any textual fields of transactions such as disputes, chargebacks, etc. across different transactions, according to Andras Cser, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester. The emerging technology also includes using machine learning and algorithms to parse large amounts of merchant and issuer data, he said.\n\n\"This is the motivation for Visa to acquire Featurespace ,\" Cser said.\n\nBattling card testing fraud is a great application for machine learning and advanced data management, according to David Mattei, strategic advisor for the fraud and anti-money-laundering practice at Datos Insights.\n\n\"The one thing in common I see with these newer card testing detection solutions is that they are coming from industry players considered to be at the network level,\" Mattei said, adding these firms view card authorization traffic across many merchants and financial institutions. Due to the nature of card testing, it is very helpful to have that 50,000 foot perspective to detect card testing attacks. Stripe is in a good position to offer this kind of solution.\"\n\n"

While a confluence of factors is responsible for lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to multiple record-closing highs last year, none played a bigger role than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI gives software and systems the ability to make split-second decisions without the need for human input or intervention. It's a technology that has wide-reaching utility in virtually all industries around the globe.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBut as we've seen from other game-changing technologies and innovations over the last couple of decades, not all early stage risers are necessarily long-term winners. The wide variance observed in price targets for artificial intelligence stocks on Wall Street speaks to this mixed outlook.\n\nBased on low-water price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts, the following three premier AI stocks are expected to plunge by up to 86% in the new year.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied downside of 55%\n\nThe first rapidly growing AI stock that at least one Wall Street analyst believes will plummet in 2025 is customizable rack server and storage solutions company Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). According to Mehdi Hosseini or Susquehanna, Supermicro stock is headed for $15 per share, which would equate to a whopping 55% decline, relative to where shares closed on Jan. 3.\n\nOn paper, Supermicro finds itself ideally positioned to take advantage of the AI revolution. Companies are paying big bucks for the data center infrastructure necessary to make split-second decisions, run generative AI solutions, and build/train large language models. In fiscal 2024, Supermicro's net sales surged by 110% to nearly $15 billion.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, Super Micro Computer utilizes Nvidia's ultra-popular graphics processing units (GPUs) in its rack servers. With Nvidia's chips possessing superior computing speed, it's made SuperMicro's servers even more desirable.\n\nBut as you can guess from Hosseini's price target, things haven't gone as planned. In late August, Super Micro Computer was the subject of a research report from noted short-seller Hindenburg Research, which alleged, among other things, \"accounting manipulation.\" Since this report, the company has:\n\nDelayed the filing of its annual report.\n\nHad an early stage probe commenced by federal regulators regarding its accounting practices, per The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHad Ernst & Young resign as the company's auditor.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Dell on Monday announced an overhaul of its PC branding strategy with a simplified naming scheme that bears a striking resemblance to Apple's iPhone nomenclature.\n\n\n\nThe computer manufacturer is retiring its long-standing product names like XPS and Inspiron in favor of three straightforward tiers: Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max \u2013 a clear copy of Apple's iPhone naming convention, which has used \"Pro\" and \"Pro Max\" to distinguish its higher-end models since the iPhone 11 was introduced in 2019.\n\nThe announcement reportedly raised eyebrows at Dell's press briefing ahead of CES. \"Your branding sounds a lot like Apple. Aren't you just following them?\" one audience member asked Dell executives, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\"Customers really prefer names that are easy to remember and easy to pronounce,\" Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke responded to reporters. Buyers shouldn't have to spend time \"figuring out our nomenclature, which at times has been a bit confusing,\" he said.\n\nClarke went on to claim that the new naming strategy was supported by research involving \"tens of thousands of customers,\" and argued that no company owns common words like \"pro\" or \"max.\" The new naming system will \"make it easier for our customers to do business with us,\" added Dell founder and CEO, Michael Dell.\n\nKevin Terwilliger, a vice president of Dell's PC business, explained that the rebrand aims to simplify product recognition for customers, similar to Apple's approach of anchoring products to a single brand name. The gaming-focused Alienware brand, which Dell acquired in 2006, will retain its existing branding.\n\nThe Dell CEO framed the rebranding as part of a broader strategy to capitalize on the aging PC market, particularly as AI capabilities become more important in computing. Many of the new Dell-branded devices will include neural processing units optimized for AI tasks.\n\nPC manufacturers are seeking to reinvigorate sales following a post-pandemic slump, with Dell, HP, and Lenovo all exploring various strategies to encourage upgrades. For what it's worth, Apple isn't the only consumer electronics company to use \"pro\" in its product names. Microsoft has its Surface Pro tablets, for example, but it's hard to imagine the latter attempting to justify the introduction of a \"Surface Pro Max\" while maintaining a straight face."

            "article_content": "Understanding Dell's New Branding\n\nDell's new branding efforts in a nutshell\n\nThe Dell Pro 14 Plus\n\nThe Dell Pro and Pro Max Lineups\n\nDell's Pro Max 14 and 16 Premium\n\nThe step down from Premium to Dell Pro Plus includes 13, 14, and 16-inch models, and comes as either a traditional laptop or a 2-in-1 form factor. Regardless of the size and design, all of these machines use the same BIOS to make life easier for IT departments. Dell Pro Plus notebooks use 50% recycled aluminum shells.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the Dell Pro machines have some design features in common. They all have dedicated HDMI, USB, and Thunderbolt connectivity options. They're also all available with 5G modems for WAN connectivity as well as Wi-Fi 7 for local wireless networks. We also know that other Meteor Lake notebooks feature beastly battery life, and Dell says these will last up to 21 hours away from the wall.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also Dell Pro Desktops coming. These have a variety of form factors including micro, slim desktop, and tower configurations. These have both Intel Core Ultra and AMD Ryzen CPU options, and will be Dell's first commercial desktops with NPUs on board.\n\nDell Pro AI Studio\n\nDell talks in-depth about AI PCs and Dell Pro AI Studio at CES\n\nDell talks in-depth about AI PCs and Dell Pro AI Studio at CES\n\nThe Dell 14 and 16 Plus\n\nThe Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1 is the first consumer notebook with the new branding\n\nBranding efforts are tricky business. Choose an obtuse name and it can be tricky to know what you're even selling. Of course, Dell's branding hasn't fallen into that category, but names like Latitude and Inspiron can be tough to decipher if you're new to PCs. That's why the largest privately-owned PC manufacturer, Dell, not only announced a truckload of new AI PCs at CES, it also rolled out a new series of brands to simplify its product lineup and help consumers understand what they're buying. Meet Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Max.Before we dive too deeply into the names, we want to point out there are lots of PCs coming very soon under these three umbrellas. The first wave of machines are mostly laptops with names that indicate screen sizes. As we go, we'll see things like Dell Pro 13 Premium and Dell 16 Plus, and it will all make sense after understanding the new branding. While the first wave of AI PCs were Snapdragon X1 Elite-based notebooks, these are for the most part x86 notebooks using Lunar Lake CPUs from Intel's Core Ultra 200 series.At first it might appear that Dell has taken iPhone names and applied them to PCs, but it's not quite that simple as there are suffixes that can be applied to each. It's basically three categories of device: Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max. Within each category, suffixes indicate things like build quality and performance tiers. First is the non-suffixed name, which is the base model, and then the Plus is a step-up and Premium is pretty self-explanatory. Understanding it as a 3x3 grid helped this author wrap his brain around it. All the same, a name like Dell Pro Max 16 Premium doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.The Dell branding will encompass everything that targets individual consumers -- fare thee well, Inspiron, Inspiron Plus, and XPS brands. These names have served the company well. However, in 2025 they've been replaced with Dell base models and their suffixed brethren: Dell Plus and Dell Premium.That means folks shopping on Amazon or at Best Buy for a home computer are going to see three brands, just like they have in the past. The names should also be clearer; it's obvious that Dell Plus is better than Dell, while Dell Premium sits on top. And it should be noted that Dell's gaming brand Alienware isn't going anywhere, either. New models in Alienware's lineup were just announced, as a matter of fact.After that are the models targeted at corporate buyers. Dell Pro more-or-less replaces the Latitude brand of business notebooks and desktops. Meanwhile, the high-performance Precision lineup has been dubbed Dell Pro Max. And of course those brands all have their own base, Plus, and Premium branding applied to them. Pretty straightforward, right? Right, so let's move on to the systems themselves.The first machines to roll out under the new branding are, for the most part, Dell Pro and Pro Max PCs. We'll start with the Dell Pro 13 Premium and 14 Premium. As their names imply, they ship with 13 and 14-inch displays with 16:10 aspect ratios and either FHD+ or QHD+ resolutions. Later this year, these notebooks will be available with Tandem OLED displays (first seen on the M4 iPad Pro) for a 24% increase in efficiency and a 49% weight reduction compared to previous OLED designs. The early models will instead come with mini-LED backlit IPS displays.The Dell Pro Premium notebooks are also built upon 90% recycled magnesium frames that keep the weight down to as low as 2.36 pounds. Despite the light weight, these systems meet the MIL-STD H durability spec so they can survive long days in the airport or driving around. These notebooks also have dual-fan cooling systems that the company says keeps them quiet while increasing air flow by 20%. Dell Pro Premium cooling systems will be riding atop Intel Core Ultra 200v-series processors.The same Lunar Lake CPUs which have on-board NPUs that enable Copilot+ features in Windows will also drive Dell Pro AI Studio. This would be easy to dismiss as the company's own take on on-device AI, but it's actually quite a bit more. Dell Pro AI Studio goes a lot farther than just configuring some settings for different workloads, though; Dell Pro AI Studio has its own collection of validated models that have been optimized for the hardware of a Dell Pro PC that can be easily deployed on-device using the Dell Management Portal. This video presentation from Dell goes into much more detail.Of course, all of these features can be done through public repositories like HuggingFace or downloading random repos from different hardware makers on GitHub. However, having all of this collected and (more importantly) validated by the OEM makes getting a useful AI model onto a PC a breeze. This lets Dell Pro users focus on getting work done rather than setting up an environment.Consumer PCs aren't left out of the initial launch of Dell's rebranding efforts. The Dell 14 Plus and 16 Plus will be available as both traditional notebooks and 2-in-1 designs. To start with, these systems will have Intel Core Ultra 200v processors that increase battery life 39% over the previous generation of Inspiron Plus notebooks.Later this year, Dell says it will flesh out the consumer offerings to include desktops and notebooks. There will be options based on not only Intel Core CPUs, but also AMD Ryzen and Qualcomm Snapdragon X series processors as well. As these machines launch and Dell continues with its rebranding efforts, we'll be sure to bring more. For now, you can see more about Dell Pro computers directly from Dell itself."

This includes the creation of landing zones, defining the VPN, gateway connections, network policies, storage policies, hosting key services within a private subnet and setting up the right IAM policies (resource policies, setting up the organization, deletion policies). Creating awareness of the policy of least privilege and addressing frustrations when cloud users ask for more to play with, and as a cloud CoE team, you are rightfully holding your ground that comes with it. The cloud CoE team should collect feedback from the users and tweak policies along the way as they deem fit. As the enterprise user community matures through this learning curve, the CoE team has a pivotal role to play in engaging them proactively, supporting them, meeting their needs and helping them address their pain points to lay a strong foundation for building a robust cloud infrastructure that is scalable to deliver business value.\n\nPartnering with the enterprise architecture team in this stage of the cloud journey can speed up cloud maturity and buttress the foundation further on solid bearings. The cloud CoE team of architects should work with the EA to align with the reference architecture patterns that the CoE team would like the application teams/product teams to follow in their solution design. This strategic and collaborative work serves as a blueprint for the architects to \u2018show and tell\u2019 the concept of designing cloud-effective solutions and shape mindsets towards the \u2018making money with the cloud\u2019 vision. Every company that wants to succeed in scaling AI solutions and capabilities today needs to get this design thinking working for them. Otherwise, it\u2019s like the story of \u2018sour grapes\u2019 with high cloud cost bills coming their way with little value added in the AI domain as it has been for a lot of companies in 2024.\n\n3. WALK FASTER: Develop cloud adoption planning and migration roadmap\n\nWith the CoE and EA teams working in tandem, it\u2019s time to engage the business stakeholders/product owners and develop the plan and roadmap. Understanding business constraints and priorities, and evaluating domains that have opportunities to expand their revenue and grow exponentially upon moving to the cloud are the key parameters to keep in mind. I recommend a structured approach for this phase of the journey."

The serverless approach does help in the management of the application since the basic infrastructure and scalability are not a relevant factor and the application can even be made to scale at the level of a function. While, on the other hand, edge computing distributes applications closer to users, which minimizes the time for response and fulfils the compliance standards of the distributed systems.\n\nAn interesting trend is the active use of AI in predictive deployment optimization. The use of advanced algorithms has reduced the role of man in determining resources to allocate, in canary analysis or in making the rollback decision. The trends mentioned above combined with the tools which are yet to gain popularity such as service mesh improvements and policy-as-code approaches are already raising the new bar for automated processes."

They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,\u201d the scientist highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow up with Chiron,\n\n\u201cIt will come closer to us, and if we can study it at nearer distances and get better reads on the quantities and nature of the ices, silicates, and organics, we will be able to better understand how seasonal insolation variations and different illumination patterns can affect its behavior and its ice reservoir.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The Webb Space Telescope captured a record-breaking image of stars in the Dragon Arc, a serpentine crescent of a galaxy in the distant universe.\n\nThe galaxy is a whopping 6.5 billion light-years from Earth and Webb\u2019s recent snapshot of it captures 44 individual stars, seen thanks to the telescope\u2019s remarkable capabilities and the fortuitous layout of objects between the telescope and the galaxy. Let us explain.\n\nThe Dragon Arc is just that\u2014a bent strip of light in space\u2014because its light is flattened by the gravity of intervening objects. Those intervening objects are gravitational lenses, which bend and refocus the light from more distant objects, magnifying them to an observer (in this case, the Webb Space Telescope).\n\nLens within a lens\n\nIn a recent study, a group of astronomers scrutinized Webb observations of a galaxy cluster and well-known gravitational lens known as Abell 370. The cluster magnified the distant stars by approximately 100 times, and a star within the cluster acted as a lens within that lens, making the distant stars come into sharper relief. The team\u2019s research describing the target stars was published this week in Nature Astronomy.\n\n\u201cInside the galaxy cluster, there are many stars floating around that are not bound by any galaxy,\u201d said Eiichi Egami, a research professor at Steward Observatory and co-author of the paper, in an Arizona State University release. \u201cWhen one of them happens to pass in front of the background star in the distant galaxy along the line of sight with Earth, it acts as a microlens, in addition to the microlensing effect of the galaxy cluster as a whole.\u201d\n\nNew possibilities\n\nThe lensception, if you will, made it possible for the research team to pick out individual stars which otherwise would have been too fuzzy to make out. The team studied the stars and concluded that \u201cmany of them are consistent with red giants or supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds,\u201d as the group wrote in the paper.\n\n\u201cThis groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\u201d said Fengwu Sun, a researcher at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, in the release.\n\nSuch red stars are nearing the end of their lives. As the stars use up their fuel, they swell and offload reams of gas and dust. Webb is no stranger to such ancient stars; in 2022 and 2023, the state-of-the-art observatory trained its eye on Earendel, the most distant known star, and found signs that the ancient ball of gas may have a partner in crime.\n\nDiscovering a single distant star is remarkable on its own. In November 2024, astronomers captured the first detailed image of a star outside our galaxy\u2014a red supergiant in its final stages of life. But a whole collection of stars is more scientifically useful. As the team wrote, the work demonstrates that \u201cobservations by the Webb Space Telescope could lead to the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.\u201d\n\nAstronomers will conduct follow-up observations of the arc with the Webb telescope, which are expected to reveal more of the magnified stars within the distorted galaxy. Besides helping scientists understand how different gravitational lenses magnify ancient light, the findings could reveal aspects of dark matter."

            "article_content": "The Western Ghats and Northeast India has always been recognized as biodiversity rich and hotspots in India with multiple discoveries of endemic species from these regions, according to a Mongabay-India (MI) report.\n\nIn 2024 too, multiple species were newly described, most of them reptiles, amphibians or insects. Every new discovery is significant as it potentially redefines the course of science and takes us a step closer to the understanding of biodiversity and its conservation and management, says the MI report.\n\nSome of these new species have been highlighted in the report. The king cobra was long believed to be a single species \u2013 Ophiophagus hannah. The longest venomous snake in the world is not considered to have much conservation significance and is listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened taxa. That is about to change as a global study led by the Western Ghats-based scientist P Gowri Shankar has questioned the belief through a new discovery that the king cobra is not one species, but four distinct species separated by geographies. Among the four, two species are severely threatened, including the Western Ghats species, now named Ophiophagus kaalinga. The latest study findings that king cobra is not one, but four species have implications on both conservation and antivenom research.\n\nWhen the species in question is as common as a lizard, the MI report points out how amphibian researcher Sandeep Das nearly missed identifying a new species because it closely resembled the widely known Agasthyagama bedomii, or northern kangaroo lizard. However, after consulting with other experts, he realised that the location of the sighting \u2013 a hilly district in Idukki, Kerala \u2013 was too far from the typical range of A. bedomii. Further studies confirmed this finding, leading to the discovery of a previously unrecognised species. Named Agasthyagama edge, the authors describe the species as \u201csuperficially similar to Agasthyagama bedomii in overall shape, size and colour but can be distinguished by combination of characters.\n\nThe northeastern parts of India, as diverse in animal and plant species as the Western Ghats, are relatively less studied, primarily due to the mostly hostile terrain and turbulence the region has witnessed historically. Despite these challenges, many researchers have managed to do some intense species studies in the region. For Mongabay India, the year 2024 began with the news of three new frog species \u2014 Gracixalus patkaiensis, Alcalus fontinalis, and Nidirana noadihing \u2014 discovered from the biodiversity hotspot of Kamlang-Namdapha landscape in Arunachal Pradesh. Tucked between Myanmar and India, Namdapha is considered the northernmost limit of the tropical rainforest in the world. Namdapha region, located on the border, faces many anthropogenic pressures that pose conservation challenges. Another reason why these discoveries are special is because those are not just three new species but three new genera \u2013 a taxonomic category comprising species exhibiting similar characteristics \u2013 recorded from India.\n\nThe MI report then adds that in 2017, field entomologist Vivek Sarkar and his assistant Tushar Sangma identified a new cicada species during an acoustic survey in Balpakram National Park, located in South Garo Hills, Meghalaya in 2017, leading to the identification of Becquartina bicolor, the bicolour butterfly cicada. In 2020, Rodeson Thangkhiew \u2013 then a PhD scholar and now an assistant professor of zoology at the University of Science and Technology in Meghalaya \u2013 was drawn to a unique cicada call coming from a tree next to a small stream. His observations would later align with Sarkar\u2019s findings. The two teams published their research in March 2024 in Zootaxa. Sarkar emphasised that the locals in South Garo Hills and Ri Bhoi were already familiar with the bicolour butterfly cicada, underscoring the importance of integrating traditional ecological knowledge from local communities into scientific research.\n\nQuite recently, another MI report while highlighting the importance of dung beetles in maintaining environmental health, also informed about the discovery of new dung beetle species, two of which are from northeast India. One of the important lessons from these new discoveries is the extent of biodiversity the country holds. These new findings have far-reaching impacts on conservation science: every new discovery is a step closer to our understanding of biodiversity and its conservation and management."

            "article_content": "LI MIN/CHINA DAILY\n\nThe increase in agricultural productivity over the past century has enabled a five-fold increase in the human population and about a 50 percent increase in food per person.\n\nKnowledge, machinery and chemicals significantly replace land and labor in agricultural production. These achievements have also led to increased greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and biodiversity loss. China exemplifies both the achievements and challenges of this transition. It has performed outstandingly on the agricultural front, feeding 22 percent of the world's population with 9 percent of the world's arable land and an uneven distribution of water resources.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2009, China's agricultural labor decreased by 5 percent while agricultural productivity increased by 6.5 percent a year. However, agriculture accounts for 17 percent of China's greenhouse gas emissions and about 8 percent of the degradation of agricultural soil. China and the rest of humankind face the challenge of increasing agricultural production by 70 percent by 2050 while simultaneously reducing or eliminating the side effects of agriculture to make it sustainable.\n\nWe suggest that agriculture develop \"smart\" strategies to increase agricultural productivity while reducing resource load and eliminating environmental side effects. These strategies will take advantage of the capabilities of modern science and the development of enlightened policies and institutions.\n\n\"Smart agriculture\" should take advantage of modern scientific discoveries. First is the biotechnology revolution, starting with the discovery of DNA, which led to a better understanding of how genetics affects the performance of animals and plants. Biotechnology has become essential to modern medicine. The COVID-19 vaccine was developed using biotechnology tools.\n\nYet the adoption of agricultural biotechnology has been limited by regulation. All major national academies of sciences say that genetically modified crops are as safe as traditional crops. Still, regulations have limited the adoption of genetic engineering, mainly in producing fiber and animal feed. About three-fourths of the world's cotton and soybean and one-third of the corn are produced by genetically modified organisms. The adoption of GMOs has substantially increased the yield of these crops, reduced the use of toxic pesticides and increased the income of farmers.\n\nThe biotechnology revolution is only in its infancy. New biotechnology capabilities, such as gene editing, allow faster development of new varieties of crops in response to diseases and climate change. Modern biotechnology has immense potential to improve veterinary medicine and prevent billions of dollars in economic losses from animal diseases. The Beijing Institute of Genomics provides China with an excellent foundation for genetic engineering research and development. Hopefully, it will be used more intensively.\n\nThe \"Information Revolution\" is another contributor to \"smart agriculture\". Precision farming can monitor crop conditions and apply input wherever and in the specific amount needed. This increases yield, saves input use, and reduces the adverse side effects of overusing chemicals and water.\n\nPrecision agriculture, too, is under-adopted in China. Still, adoption rates can be improved by developing low-cost precision methods for small-scale farmers and providing financial incentives and technical support for adoption. Smart agricultural systems also include drip irrigation, which has increased crop yield by about 40 percent while reducing water and chemical use by up to 50 percent. And low- and no-tillage practices and cover cropping can lead to less carbon loss and greater productivity in the long run.\n\nScientific discoveries enable us to develop circular technologies to reuse agricultural residues as a source of value. The black soldier fly is an example of an insect that converts agricultural waste into proteins that can be used to feed livestock and support aquaculture. Its potential is apparent from its use in China. Crop and forest residues can be converted into biochar to enhance farm productivity and store carbon. In this regard, significant agricultural productivity differences exist among regions in China and the rest of the world.\n\nThus, the transfer of knowledge among regions and the adoption of \"smart agriculture\" have an immense potential to increase the productivity and sustainability of agriculture.\n\nPolicies can enhance the development of \"smart agriculture\". First is continued investment in life sciences and agricultural research and development and extension efforts to transfer the knowledge to practitioners. The rate of monetary return for agricultural research is much higher than market rates. And since climate change is a global challenge, it is crucial to drastically expand agricultural R&D in developing countries, enhancing their capacity to adapt and mitigate.\n\nSecond is regulatory reform, which introduces science-based regulation of technologies and activities, balancing benefits and risks. Extreme precaution leading to inaction is risky. But risk is part of life; we cannot avoid it but can control and mitigate it.\n\nThird is the introduction of pricing that considers the cost of environmental side effects from economic activities, thus providing the incentive for introducing clean technologies.\n\nFinally, it is essential to maintain a global exchange of knowledge and global trade in agricultural markets. We are stronger when cooperating against common challenges than when each country operates alone.\n\nThe author is a Wolf Prize Laureate, a member of US National Academy of Sciences, and a professor in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California.
