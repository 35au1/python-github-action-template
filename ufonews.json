            "article_content": "A former Air Force Special Operations airman told NewsNation that he worked for a secret unit that retrieved debris that he believes was from crashed unidentified flying objects.\n\n\u201cJust visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous,\u201d Jacob Barber, who said he had worked in both official and unofficial capacities for the U.S. government, told the network. \u201cIt was not human.\u201d\n\nBarber told NewsNation\u2019s Ross Coulthart that the object looked like a large white egg and was about the size of an SUV. The UFO \u2015 which the U.S. government now calls UAPs, or unidentified aerial phenomena \u2015 had no engine and no thermal signature.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconsistent with anything I\u2019d ever seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cI can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBarber said it was later confirmed to him that the object was from a \u201cnonhuman intelligence,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t know what it was.\n\nHe said he also picked up what he called an \u201ceightgon,\u201d which he described as \u201ca flying disc with what looked like eight delineated sections.\u201d Barber described feeling \u201codd\u201d and growing more emotional as he got closer to the \u201ceightgon\u201d object.\n\n\u201cI felt like something connected with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like something had tuned in to me and my soul and was providing me some sense of guidance on what to do and how profound what I was doing was. It was so overwhelming that I began to cry.\u201d\n\nNewsNation also said it independently obtained footage of an egg-shaped object being moved by helicopter:\n\nWhile few details can be seen, the object isn\u2019t dissimilar to some of those seen in flight in prior videos from other whistleblowers, footage later confirmed by the Pentagon as authentic.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne, called the \u201cTic Tac\u201d because of its similarity to the mint candies, shows a white object with no visible wings or engines moving rapidly through the sky as pilots react in awe.\n\nThere has been no clear answer as to what the objects are, but some observers have noted that there are more down-to-earth explanations for them, such as drones or balloons, in some cases of potentially foreign origin and with advanced \u2015 but not alien \u2015 technology.\n\nSee NewsNation\u2019s full interview with Barber below:"

One of the first notable sightings came in 1966 when a mysterious glowing object was seen over Wanaque.\n\nIt started on Jan. 11 when people from many other towns were among callers to police that they saw the strange object over the Wanaque reservoir. Calls came from Ringwood, Totowa, Paterson, Oakland, and even Butler. It was described as between 2 to 9 feet with a light brighter than any star changing from white to red to green and it was reported the object moved in a manner no man-made aircraft could.\n\nWhat made this sighting so credible is the huge number of people reporting it. Even the mayor of Wanaque saw this.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon was terribly strange,\u201d Mayor Harry T. Wolfe explained. He described it as an oval object.\n\nWitness calls came in from a 20-mile radius. The closest reported seeing this thing burn a hole in the reservoir\u2019s ice, a brilliant light beam shooting down from the object.\n\nCanva / TSM Illustration Canva / TSM Illustration loading...\n\nIt didn\u2019t end there. The next day, Jan. 12, a police officer, Jack Wardlaw, reported he witnessed a brilliant white disc floating near his home in the Wanaque\u2019s Stonetown section.\n\nWardlaw described it as \u201cdefinitely disc-shaped and at certain angles, egg-shaped.\u201d\n\nStacker compiled a list of New Jersey towns with the most UFO sightings in the last 30 years.

However, these waves can be present beyond the clouds and may exist even when no clouds are formed.\n\nThe clouds can result in very strong gusty winds in one place, with still air only a few hundred metres away.\n\nPilots of powered aircraft tend to avoid flying near lenticular clouds because of the turbulence associated with them. Skilled glider pilots like them because they can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising."

            "article_content": "It will be a close encounter of the informative and entertaining kind when a local paranormal investigator shares his experiences at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library in Gardner.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, who starred on the \"Expedition Bigfoot\" series on the Discovery Channel for several season and appears regularly on \"Paranormal Caught on Camera\" the Travel Channel, will discuss the phenomena of unidentified flying objects in New England at the library on Wednesday, Jan. 22.\n\nLeBlanc, who lives in Leominster and is the author of two \"Monsterland\" books, said he had been unaware that Central Massachusetts had been such a hotbed of UFO activity until he began doing research for his first book.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, a renowned Leominster-based paranormal investigator, will discuss \"UFOs in New England\" at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library on Wednesday, Jan. 22. The event, which will begin at 6:00 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\n\"There were rumors that Fort Devens, believe it or not, had a crash-retrieval program for UFOs, and then I heard from people personally that they had heard Fort Devens had a supposed recovered UFO, which kind of blew me away,\" said LeBlanc. \"For whatever reason, this area has had a long history of this stuff.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn fact, LeBlanc said, the very first UFO sighting ever reported occured in Massachusetts in the 1600s, when Gov. James Winthrop claimed to have seen a strange light moving up and down in the sky over Charlestown. And people have been fascinated by the possibility of being visited by aliens ever since, he said.\n\n\"What are these things and why are people seeing these crafts?\" LeBlanc wondered. \"Not all of these people can be lying, and I think people are ready now for the truth to come out. There has to be life elsewhere.\"\n\nUFOs in Ashburnham?\n\nNo discussion of UFOs in New England can be complete without including the \"Andreasson Affair,\" a celebrated case concerning the alleged abduction of an Ashburnham woman by aliens in 1967. The incident, which was the subject of several books and a movie, concerned the experience of Betty Andreasson, who claimed to have been abducted from her Highland Ave. home, taken aboard a UFO, and experimented on by aliens.\n\nMore: An Ashburnham close encounter 50 years ago\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLeBlanc said the Andreasson incident one of UFOlogy's most interested cases because of how much serious investigation went into trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"Through 1965 and 1967, during that time period, there were a lot of reports of flying saucers, but Betty's story was really compelling,\" LeBlanc said, adding that unusual phenomena seemed to follow Andreasson, who also lived for a time in Fitchburg and Leominster, throughout her life. \"She passed several lie-detector tests, people witnessed an orange orb appear in the room while she was being interviewed, and another time people witnessed a gray alien materialize in the interview room and then disappear. There was some real strange stuff going on with her.\"\n\nAfter Andreasson moved to Florida, according to LeBlanc, her husband reported seeing mysterious black helicopters hovering over the couple's home from time to time.\n\nRecent drone sightings have renewed interest in UFOs\n\nRecent reports of mystery drones flying over the East coast had sparked a renewed interest in UFOs, and LeBlanc said it was possible that some of the object in the skies could be of extraterrestrial origin. And he has a bold prediction for the year ahead.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore: Officials investigate drone sightings spotted in New Jersey and other states\n\n\"I think we're going to find out we're not alone in 2025,\" he said.\n\nThe event, which will be held in the library's Greenwood Meeting Room at 6 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Levi Heywood Memorial Library to host UFOs in New England presentation"

            "article_content": "It will be a close encounter of the informative and entertaining kind when a local paranormal investigator shares his experiences at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library in Gardner.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, who starred on the \"Expedition Bigfoot\" series on the Discovery Channel for several season and appears regularly on \"Paranormal Caught on Camera\" the Travel Channel, will discuss the phenomena of unidentified flying objects in New England at the library on Wednesday, Jan. 22.\n\nLeBlanc, who lives in Leominster and is the author of two \"Monsterland\" books, said he had been unaware that Central Massachusetts had been such a hotbed of UFO activity until he began doing research for his first book.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, a renowned Leominster-based paranormal investigator, will discuss \"UFOs in New England\" at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library on Wednesday, Jan. 22. The event, which will begin at 6:00 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\n\"There were rumors that Fort Devens, believe it or not, had a crash-retrieval program for UFOs, and then I heard from people personally that they had heard Fort Devens had a supposed recovered UFO, which kind of blew me away,\" said LeBlanc. \"For whatever reason, this area has had a long history of this stuff.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, LeBlanc said, the very first UFO sighting ever reported occured in Massachusetts in the 1600s, when Gov. James Winthrop claimed to have seen a strange light moving up and down in the sky over Charlestown. And people have been fascinated by the possibility of being visited by aliens ever since, he said.\n\n\"What are these things and why are people seeing these crafts?\" LeBlanc wondered. \"Not all of these people can be lying, and I think people are ready now for the truth to come out. There has to be life elsewhere.\"\n\nUFOs in Ashburnham?\n\nNo discussion of UFOs in New England can be complete without including the \"Andreasson Affair,\" a celebrated case concerning the alleged abduction of an Ashburnham woman by aliens in 1967. The incident, which was the subject of several books and a movie, concerned the experience of Betty Andreasson, who claimed to have been abducted from her Highland Ave. home, taken aboard a UFO, and experimented on by aliens.\n\nMore: An Ashburnham close encounter 50 years ago\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeBlanc said the Andreasson incident one of UFOlogy's most interested cases because of how much serious investigation went into trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"Through 1965 and 1967, during that time period, there were a lot of reports of flying saucers, but Betty's story was really compelling,\" LeBlanc said, adding that unusual phenomena seemed to follow Andreasson, who also lived for a time in Fitchburg and Leominster, throughout her life. \"She passed several lie-detector tests, people witnessed an orange orb appear in the room while she was being interviewed, and another time people witnessed a gray alien materialize in the interview room and then disappear. There was some real strange stuff going on with her.\"\n\nAfter Andreasson moved to Florida, according to LeBlanc, her husband reported seeing mysterious black helicopters hovering over the couple's home from time to time.\n\nRecent drone sightings have renewed interest in UFOs\n\nRecent reports of mystery drones flying over the East coast had sparked a renewed interest in UFOs, and LeBlanc said it was possible that some of the object in the skies could be of extraterrestrial origin. And he has a bold prediction for the year ahead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore: Officials investigate drone sightings spotted in New Jersey and other states\n\n\"I think we're going to find out we're not alone in 2025,\" he said.\n\nThe event, which will be held in the library's Greenwood Meeting Room at 6 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Levi Heywood Memorial Library to host UFOs in New England presentation"

Unearthed from the arid and discovery-rich Pisco basin, this nearly-complete Cosmopolitodus Hastalis fossil highlights the region's significant contributions to understanding prehistoric marine life.\n\nThe shark's fossilized remains, including a jaw equipped with teeth reaching up to 8.9 centimeters, are a testament to the species' dominance in ancient seas. With adults reaching lengths comparable to small boats, these marine giants had a diet chiefly composed of sardines, as evidenced by remnants found within the specimen's stomach.\n\nDuring the presentation, paleontologist Mario Urbina emphasized the rarity of complete shark fossils, enhancing the importance of this discovery. This unveiling follows previous finds in the region, including ancient river dolphin and crocodile fossils, cementing Peru's standing as a pivotal site for paleontological research.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "All the key players in cyber-security make predictions at the end of every year and 2025 is no exception, there was a flurry of predictions which are nicely summarized here.\n\nSo why would we add our thoughts to an already crowded field (and in January..)? Well no one seems to have looked specifically at mobile cybersecurity. As everyone should know by now, mobile app security is an issue which must be taken seriously, and having some insight into key trends is important.\n\nWe do think that our expansive customer base, ongoing research initiatives and the insights we collect from our live threat metrics, give us some visibility into trends. So here goes\u2026If you are responsible for mobile app security, here are seven mobile security trends to think about. We hope this helps you prepare your own plan for navigating the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in 2025.\n\nThe 7 Big Mobile Security Trends to Plan for in 2025\n\n1. Alternative app stores are so 2024! \u201cDirect to consumer\u201d will be the new trend in 2025\n\nWe have reported extensively on the pressure building on Apple and Google during 2024 to break up their lucrative monopolistic practices which lock in developers. Alternative app stores like the one from Epic Games are up and running. This pressure will increase in 2025 but a whole new front will open up too. 2024 was all about allowing alternative app stores and payment mechanisms, but next up will be a drive to direct-to-consumer models \u2013 why do I even need an app store? When I download an app on my laptop, I go right ahead and the laptop manufacturer has no part to play. A new court case in the UK is a sign of what\u2019s to come. Expect continued engagement from the Coalition for App Fairness and from governments around the world to drive this forward. This trend will cause mobile app security to be re-evaluated in 2025: alternatives to native security will need to be found.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nAs it becomes clear that security provided by Apple, Google, Huawei is actually quite limited, and in any case do not work with alternative app stores and direct to consumer models, it makes a lot of sense to try to find a cross-platform security solution which makes it easy for you to embrace new approaches and platforms.\n\n2. AI Will Continue to be Adopted by Hackers \u2026 and Security Teams\n\n2024 was the year when AI started being used everywhere, especially generative AI tools.\n\n\u201cAgentic AI\u201d, which is capable of independently planning and acting to achieve specific goals, will be exploited by threat actors, and this is unfortunately a good fit for mobile app attacks where attackers orchestrate complex attacks which involve gathering data from a number of sources before using this data to create automated exploits. Another looming threat in 2025 is AI tools making code obfuscation even less effective. Obfuscation methods have been used extensively to protect mobile app code and IP, but AI tools are making it easier than ever for attackers to undo obfuscation.\n\nOn the other hand, AI is also being used to build better defenses. Machine learning has been employed by security tools for a while in app security, particularly where user behaviour or other non-deterministic signals need to be assessed and classified. Concerns have been raised however about the \u201cblack box\u201d nature of some of the tools and the AI skills gap in most organizations. OWASP published their first Top 10 for LLM Applications and a guide to AI for CISOs in 2024.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nAI should always be a means to an end, and clear goals such should be set for any new deployment e.g. you must quantify the resource savings and process improvements expected from the automation of security tasks, set a goal for time to market speed increase from faster identification of vulnerabilities etc. It also always makes sense to prioritize deterministic solutions for particular use-cases as alternatives to AI, if such solutions exist, to minimize the risk of false positives.\n\n3. 2025 Will Be When API Keys in Mobile Apps Are Properly Secured\n\n2024 has been a terrible year for API secrets protection. It continued to be easy to find secrets in mobile app code and it seemed like hardly a week went by without another breach being reported due to theft and misuse of API credentials. Our own research and many other reports show the extent of the problem. The Internet Archive had a nightmare scenario where even after a breach was reported attackers continued to use stolen Zendesk API keys, suggesting that the organization had some challenges rotating compromised keys when an issue was identified. It\u2019s not a surprise that credential management is number 1 on the OWASP Mobile Top Ten but will 2025 be the year when the problem is finally addressed? We really hope so!\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nThe only practical way to ensure secrets are safe is to adopt a dynamic, zero trust security approach. Get them out of your code, and have them delivered only as needed, and only to apps which are verified via attestation. Also make sure they can be updated and rotated immediately across all your apps immediately as required.\n\n4. Cross-Platform Development Will Be The Way Forward For Mobile Apps\n\nIn 2025, cross-platform mobile development is expected to be dominated by frameworks like Flutter, React Native, and Xamarin, with a strong focus on achieving near-native performance, leveraging advanced features like AI/ML integration, and catering to new devices and emerging technologies. We predict that we will see \u201cofficial\u201d support of the HarmonyOS ecosystem in 2025 by the biggest players.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nIf you are still developing your apps using native tools, now is the time to consider migrating to a cross-platform framework, or at least moving to a hybrid approach. This should generate substantial cost savings. It\u2019s also time to evaluate your security. There are good third-party security solutions which integrate with cross-platform frameworks in order to provide advanced security across platforms in a consistent and unified way. So you can get the benefits of cross-platform development and improve your security at the same time.\n\n5. Open Source Scrutiny Will Increase\n\nThe mobile ecosystem is highly dependent on open source software and it remains a reliable driver of innovation. However 2024 saw some major issues including the vulnerabilities found in the Cocoapods dependency manager. Clearly, hackers see a path to commit supply chain attacks that could introduce malicious code updates to the corporate software projects that rely on them. During 2024 we also saw governments start to take an interest. The EU has passed the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and we can expect to see the U.S. gradually developing tighter requirements, on software components especially for software for critical infrastructure and government use.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nIn preparation for regulations or issues that could disrupt your own software supply chain, you should audit your open source components and dependencies and evaluate alternatives for any risky components of your app. You should also, of course, implement robust dependency management to track and manage open source use and ensure you\u2019re using the latest secure versions as well as investing in frequent vulnerability scanning. You must also invest in runtime protection of your app to provide an additional layer of security.\n\n5. Pinning Communications Channels Will Become The Norm\n\nMan-in-the-Middle attacks continue to be a clear and present danger to mobile apps. Tools such as Proxyman and mitmproxy can be used to intercept encrypted traffic to and from the app. Certificate pinning is the solution and OWASP recommends it. But operational challenges and potential disruptions caused when a certificate changes or expires means that devops teams have been wary of implementing this critical way of protecting the communications channels your app uses.\n\nThere are, in fact, solutions that make administration of pinning easy and maintain customer experience. These facilitate the kind of immediate rotation required when Digicert revoked thousands of certificates in July 2024. We believe that 2025 will be the year that these types of dynamic certificate pinning solutions will finally be adopted, eliminating an important attack surface for hackers.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nEvaluating and implementing dynamic certificate pinning on any communications channels your app uses would be a good security improvement to plan for 2025.\n\n6. Breach reporting requirements will require more attention and investment\n\nBreach reporting requirements around the world have become more onerous in 2024, especially in the EU, Japan and Singapore. This trend will continue into 2025. Some industries such as US Healthcare and financial institutions will face even stricter requirements. For the finance industry, PCI DSS 4.0 compliance is coming in 2025. Concerning mobile app breaches, companies are generally required to notify affected users \u201cwithout unreasonable delay\u201d and within a specific timeframe, providing details of the breach, notifying relevant regulatory bodies at the same time.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nYou need to understand the reporting requirements of the industry and the geographies in which you operate and make sure your incident response plan addresses evolving reporting requirements. You should rehearse thoroughly the procedures you will follow if and when there is a breach. In addition, service continuity in the event of a breach should be a key objective for the development team.\n\nFor mobile apps specifically, the playbook must include information about rotating any secrets and certificates your app uses, including third-party API keys. You should also include procedures on how you can quickly block rogue devices and apps without affecting genuine users.\n\nKey Takeaway \u2013 Run Time Protection\n\nAll of this can be overwhelming but there is one single key takeaway and that is a need to focus on runtime protection for mobile apps. Robust run time protection that works across platforms can prevent apps or devices being tampered with and adds a zero trust layer to other protections that you put in place \u2013 every request can be validated. It can also mitigate the limitations of code obfuscation. Dynamic management can allow you to identify and deal with issues as they arise without having to release new versions of your app. A solution such as Approov can continuously verify all aspects of the running mobile ecosystem and allow you to future proof your mobile app security.\n\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from Approov Blog authored by George McGregor.

From new delivery methods for adaptive re-use and mass timber structures to digital fabrication, new research aims to provide guidance on emerging construction methods and technologies.. Image Courtesy of Perkins&Will\n\nInnovation comes in many shapes and forms. 2025 is poised to witness continued advancements in the areas of artificial intelligence, sustainability, and biotechnology. These breakthroughs often arise from experimentation in industries like technology and healthcare, where companies have strong research and development teams and significant budgets. This enables them to produce new products and services that address society's evolving needs.\n\nIn a world confronting complex challenges, innovation in architecture plays a distinctive role. Unlike industries driven by rapid innovation cycles, architecture must balance creativity with practical solutions that are deeply rooted in human experience. What will it take for the architecture industry to fully harness its potential in shaping the future of our built environment?\n\n+ 2\n\nInterrogating this question, ArchDaily's editor Ankitha Gattupalli spoke to Leigh Christy and Yehia Madkour, architects and co-directors of Research and Innovation at Perkins&Will. Based in the Los Angeles studio, Leigh leads regional projects while also guiding firm-wide research efforts. Vancouver-based Yehia, whose work explores the intersection of design and technology, brings his expertise to the firm's research initiatives, driving innovation across 32 studios. Together, they shape the firm's research direction, advancing new approaches to design and technology.\n\nRelated Article What are Innovation Districts?\n\nArchDaily (Ankitha Gattupalli): How do you define innovation, and how do you believe it is understood when you discuss it?\n\nLeigh Christy (LC): The definition of innovation is not fixed; it evolves over time. Innovation is best understood as the combination of ideation and implementation. While ideation is central to many programs, the focus on research and application is critical for scaling and successful implementation.\n\nYehia Madkour (YM): Innovation goes beyond just generating a novel idea; it is about the execution of that idea. The true value of innovation lies in the process that follows the initial concept. There are three key steps to innovation:\n\nThe generation of a novel idea. The advancement of that idea in a meaningful direction. The creation of value, which may be societal, industrial, or personal, rather than strictly financial.\n\nAD: How do you see the architecture industry responding to the concept of innovation?\n\nYM: Architects are in a unique position to connect various elements\u2014working with clients to understand their evolving needs, collaborating with industry partners to adapt to changes, and considering economic, technological, and human factors. This central role allows us to generate innovative ideas. However, the industry, particularly in architecture and construction, tends to lag behind other sectors in terms of technological adoption.\n\nOne reason for this is the bespoke nature of design in our field, which presents challenges when attempting to apply standardized innovations. Each project often requires tailored solutions, making it difficult to implement broad, systematic changes like automation. While architects are positioned to generate many ideas, the industry as a whole still faces barriers to embracing innovation at scale.\n\nLC: I believe the approach to problem-solving through design thinking positions architects well to propose innovative solutions. We address challenges at the scale of every project, but what is particularly interesting is how we extend innovation beyond individual projects. We learn from past projects to drive future innovation, developing new tools when needed and remaining open to change when approaches prove ineffective.\n\nWhile the industry generates novel ideas, implementing systematic change and sharing progress remains inconsistent. Addressing issues like housing and climate change requires a multidisciplinary approach, with architects playing a key collaborative role alongside clients and professionals.\n\nAD: How do you decide which research areas are worth exploring?\n\nYM: Our research areas emerge from a combination of factors, including our understanding of global shifts and client-driven inquiries. Some areas are more focused on immediate applications, while others are more strategic and long-term in nature.\n\nFor instance, human experience remains central to our work and will continue to be a major research focus. Another key area is digital layering, as new technologies are continuously emerging, and understanding their integration is critical. We also prioritize urgent issues, such as environmental crises and climate change, which will remain pressing challenges for the foreseeable future.\n\nLC: An example of this approach can be seen in our mass timber research, which began over 10 years ago. It started with exploring its broader application after gaining attention in Vancouver. Initially, challenges like local availability, testing codes, and fire resistance were barriers. By partnering with structural engineers and fire consultants, we advanced the industry, and mass timber is now widely used across North America and Europe. We are now investigating its role in circularity and design for disassembly. While our mass timber research may eventually conclude, it will lead to new inquiries on alternative materials and structural systems.\n\nAD: How do you balance the potential of technology and research with the market's readiness for it?\n\nLC: This challenge ties into how we structure our research agenda. We focus on understanding both current industry needs and emerging questions from our client base. By recognizing patterns, we aim to create solutions that not only address immediate issues but also position us to address future challenges. It's about striking a balance between vision and practicality, ensuring we remain grounded in the current landscape while also preparing for the future.\n\nYM: While we concentrate on solving current needs, we also allocate time for strategic thinking. Some ideas may not be market-ready today, but they help us anticipate trends for the next 5 to 10 years. These long-term considerations may seem speculative now, but they are vital for positioning ourselves for future opportunities. Innovation involves accepting failure as part of the process, but it's essential to plan ahead, not just focus on immediate needs.\n\nAD: How do you integrate different disciplines to drive innovation and manage subject matter expertise on complex issues?\n\nLC: Collaboration is a two-way street. While our external partners bring valuable insights, we provide the projects necessary to test those ideas. This mutual exchange of expertise benefits both parties. Peer review is another critical aspect of our process\u2014before presenting our research as foundational, we seek feedback from others to refine our findings.\n\nCollaborating with specialists has been crucial in our research, such as when exploring toxins in materials or in our work on habitable materials where we learned about carbon footprint and human health. By identifying our specific questions, we can select the most suitable partners to help answer them.\n\nInnovation often requires human connection to move forward - Yehia Madkour\n\nAD: What do you see as the key barriers to innovation in architecture, and how can the industry overcome them?\n\nYM: The primary barrier to innovation in architecture is designing for one solution at a time. While this approach fuels creativity, each project's unique specifics often prevent the scalability necessary for widespread impact. In technology, scalability drives innovation by reaching millions, but in architecture, we often lack the scale to extend the impact of each idea.\n\nThe industry would benefit from a systems-thinking approach, where solutions are designed to be scalable and adaptable across different contexts. Without this systemic approach, innovation in architecture struggles to progress at the same pace as other industries. While this may seem like an unsolvable problem, I believe shifting our mindset could unlock a great deal of innovation.\n\nLC: While architecture can certainly adopt more systematic approaches, I've come to realize the importance of having a visionary role as well. Innovation in architecture isn't just about technology; it's about envisioning improvements to the built environment. This involves understanding the process that leads to a successful project, not just the final product.\n\nWhile it's tempting to look to the tech industry as the benchmark for innovation, there are other equally impactful forms of innovation, such as community engagement. Simple tools, like administering surveys, can make a significant difference in the design process.\n\nWhile we may not be as advanced in innovation as the tech industry, I believe there is immense potential in architecture to lead in innovation\u2014especially if we embrace a more comprehensive, systems-oriented mindset."

            "article_content": "Supercomputers work based on the same principles as everyday computers, but their performance levels are much higher and they look more like the classic mainframes of old. Unlike normal desktop PCs or laptops, they process massive data sets and perform calculations at incredible speeds. They're the fastest computers in the world, according to IBM , and require a massive amount of infrastructure to operate \u2014 including advanced cooling systems.\n\nArchitecturally, they are also fitted with many more components than normal PCs. Your laptop might have one central processing unit (CPU) and one graphics processing unit (GPU), but one supercomputer may have thousands upon thousands of CPUs and GPUs \u2014 each of them considerably more powerful than those you find off the shelf.\n\nRelated: World's largest computer chip WSE-3 will power massive AI supercomputer 8 times faster than the current record-holder\n\nTheir performance is also measured using floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) \u2014 where one floating-point operation is a mathematical calculation. The most powerful supercomputer in the world now exceeds 1 exaFLOP \u2014 1 quintillion (1018) FLOPS \u2014 while normal PCs and laptops usually have power of several hundred gigaFLOPS \u2014 1 trillion (109) FLOPS. We refer to machines like this as exascale supercomputers.\n\nBecause they can work with massive amounts of data and process calculations incredibly fast, scientists often use supercomputers to crack problems in drug and material discovery. Supercomputers can also make predictions \u2014 like forecasting the weather \u2014 and even learn how to play chess, like IBM's classic Deep Blue supercomputer in 1997.\n\nBased on the latest TOP500 rankings , here are the seven most powerful supercomputers online today.\n\n1.

            "article_content": "All the key players in cyber-security make predictions at the end of every year and 2025 is no exception, there was a flurry of predictions which are nicely summarized here.\n\nSo why would we add our thoughts to an already crowded field (and in January..)? Well no one seems to have looked specifically at mobile cybersecurity. As everyone should know by now, mobile app security is an issue which must be taken seriously, and having some insight into key trends is important.\n\nWe do think that our expansive customer base, ongoing research initiatives and the insights we collect from our live threat metrics, give us some visibility into trends. So here goes\u2026If you are responsible for mobile app security, here are seven mobile security trends to think about. We hope this helps you prepare your own plan for navigating the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in 2025.\n\nThe 7 Big Mobile Security Trends to Plan for in 2025\n\n1. Alternative app stores are so 2024! \u201cDirect to consumer\u201d will be the new trend in 2025\n\nWe have reported extensively on the pressure building on Apple and Google during 2024 to break up their lucrative monopolistic practices which lock in developers. Alternative app stores like the one from Epic Games are up and running. This pressure will increase in 2025 but a whole new front will open up too. 2024 was all about allowing alternative app stores and payment mechanisms, but next up will be a drive to direct-to-consumer models \u2013 why do I even need an app store? When I download an app on my laptop, I go right ahead and the laptop manufacturer has no part to play. A new court case in the UK is a sign of what\u2019s to come. Expect continued engagement from the Coalition for App Fairness and from governments around the world to drive this forward. This trend will cause mobile app security to be re-evaluated in 2025: alternatives to native security will need to be found.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nAs it becomes clear that security provided by Apple, Google, Huawei is actually quite limited, and in any case do not work with alternative app stores and direct to consumer models, it makes a lot of sense to try to find a cross-platform security solution which makes it easy for you to embrace new approaches and platforms.\n\n2. AI Will Continue to be Adopted by Hackers \u2026 and Security Teams\n\n2024 was the year when AI started being used everywhere, especially generative AI tools.\n\n\u201cAgentic AI\u201d, which is capable of independently planning and acting to achieve specific goals, will be exploited by threat actors, and this is unfortunately a good fit for mobile app attacks where attackers orchestrate complex attacks which involve gathering data from a number of sources before using this data to create automated exploits. Another looming threat in 2025 is AI tools making code obfuscation even less effective. Obfuscation methods have been used extensively to protect mobile app code and IP, but AI tools are making it easier than ever for attackers to undo obfuscation.\n\nOn the other hand, AI is also being used to build better defenses. Machine learning has been employed by security tools for a while in app security, particularly where user behaviour or other non-deterministic signals need to be assessed and classified. Concerns have been raised however about the \u201cblack box\u201d nature of some of the tools and the AI skills gap in most organizations. OWASP published their first Top 10 for LLM Applications and a guide to AI for CISOs in 2024.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nAI should always be a means to an end, and clear goals such should be set for any new deployment e.g. you must quantify the resource savings and process improvements expected from the automation of security tasks, set a goal for time to market speed increase from faster identification of vulnerabilities etc. It also always makes sense to prioritize deterministic solutions for particular use-cases as alternatives to AI, if such solutions exist, to minimize the risk of false positives.\n\n3. 2025 Will Be When API Keys in Mobile Apps Are Properly Secured\n\n2024 has been a terrible year for API secrets protection. It continued to be easy to find secrets in mobile app code and it seemed like hardly a week went by without another breach being reported due to theft and misuse of API credentials. Our own research and many other reports show the extent of the problem. The Internet Archive had a nightmare scenario where even after a breach was reported attackers continued to use stolen Zendesk API keys, suggesting that the organization had some challenges rotating compromised keys when an issue was identified. It\u2019s not a surprise that credential management is number 1 on the OWASP Mobile Top Ten but will 2025 be the year when the problem is finally addressed? We really hope so!\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nThe only practical way to ensure secrets are safe is to adopt a dynamic, zero trust security approach. Get them out of your code, and have them delivered only as needed, and only to apps which are verified via attestation. Also make sure they can be updated and rotated immediately across all your apps immediately as required.\n\n4. Cross-Platform Development Will Be The Way Forward For Mobile Apps\n\nIn 2025, cross-platform mobile development is expected to be dominated by frameworks like Flutter, React Native, and Xamarin, with a strong focus on achieving near-native performance, leveraging advanced features like AI/ML integration, and catering to new devices and emerging technologies. We predict that we will see \u201cofficial\u201d support of the HarmonyOS ecosystem in 2025 by the biggest players.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nIf you are still developing your apps using native tools, now is the time to consider migrating to a cross-platform framework, or at least moving to a hybrid approach. This should generate substantial cost savings. It\u2019s also time to evaluate your security. There are good third-party security solutions which integrate with cross-platform frameworks in order to provide advanced security across platforms in a consistent and unified way. So you can get the benefits of cross-platform development and improve your security at the same time.\n\n5. Open Source Scrutiny Will Increase\n\nThe mobile ecosystem is highly dependent on open source software and it remains a reliable driver of innovation. However 2024 saw some major issues including the vulnerabilities found in the Cocoapods dependency manager. Clearly, hackers see a path to commit supply chain attacks that could introduce malicious code updates to the corporate software projects that rely on them. During 2024 we also saw governments start to take an interest. The EU has passed the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and we can expect to see the U.S. gradually developing tighter requirements, on software components especially for software for critical infrastructure and government use.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nIn preparation for regulations or issues that could disrupt your own software supply chain, you should audit your open source components and dependencies and evaluate alternatives for any risky components of your app. You should also, of course, implement robust dependency management to track and manage open source use and ensure you\u2019re using the latest secure versions as well as investing in frequent vulnerability scanning. You must also invest in runtime protection of your app to provide an additional layer of security.\n\n5. Pinning Communications Channels Will Become The Norm\n\nMan-in-the-Middle attacks continue to be a clear and present danger to mobile apps. Tools such as Proxyman and mitmproxy can be used to intercept encrypted traffic to and from the app. Certificate pinning is the solution and OWASP recommends it. But operational challenges and potential disruptions caused when a certificate changes or expires means that devops teams have been wary of implementing this critical way of protecting the communications channels your app uses.\n\nThere are, in fact, solutions that make administration of pinning easy and maintain customer experience. These facilitate the kind of immediate rotation required when Digicert revoked thousands of certificates in July 2024. We believe that 2025 will be the year that these types of dynamic certificate pinning solutions will finally be adopted, eliminating an important attack surface for hackers.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nEvaluating and implementing dynamic certificate pinning on any communications channels your app uses would be a good security improvement to plan for 2025.\n\n6. Breach reporting requirements will require more attention and investment\n\nBreach reporting requirements around the world have become more onerous in 2024, especially in the EU, Japan and Singapore. This trend will continue into 2025. Some industries such as US Healthcare and financial institutions will face even stricter requirements. For the finance industry, PCI DSS 4.0 compliance is coming in 2025. Concerning mobile app breaches, companies are generally required to notify affected users \u201cwithout unreasonable delay\u201d and within a specific timeframe, providing details of the breach, notifying relevant regulatory bodies at the same time.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nYou need to understand the reporting requirements of the industry and the geographies in which you operate and make sure your incident response plan addresses evolving reporting requirements. You should rehearse thoroughly the procedures you will follow if and when there is a breach. In addition, service continuity in the event of a breach should be a key objective for the development team.\n\nFor mobile apps specifically, the playbook must include information about rotating any secrets and certificates your app uses, including third-party API keys. You should also include procedures on how you can quickly block rogue devices and apps without affecting genuine users.\n\nKey Takeaway \u2013 Run Time Protection\n\nAll of this can be overwhelming but there is one single key takeaway and that is a need to focus on runtime protection for mobile apps. Robust run time protection that works across platforms can prevent apps or devices being tampered with and adds a zero trust layer to other protections that you put in place \u2013 every request can be validated. It can also mitigate the limitations of code obfuscation. Dynamic management can allow you to identify and deal with issues as they arise without having to release new versions of your app. A solution such as Approov can continuously verify all aspects of the running mobile ecosystem and allow you to future proof your mobile app security.\n\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from Approov Blog authored by George McGregor.

The report warns that these collaborations could potentially harm smaller companies and stifle innovation in the rapidly evolving AI market. One major issue outlined in the report is the possibility of \u201clock-in\u201d effects.\n\nA recent report from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has raised concerns about the impact of partnerships between major tech companies, like Microsoft, and AI developers such as OpenAI, on competition in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. The report warns that these collaborations could potentially harm smaller companies and stifle innovation in the rapidly evolving AI market.\n\nThe FTC highlights the risk of anti-competitive practices resulting from multi-billion-dollar deals between tech giants and AI developers. These partnerships, while driving significant advancements, might create barriers that make it difficult for new and independent players to compete.\n\nAlso read: Accident or cover-up? OpenAI allegedly deletes potential evidence in copyright case\n\nOne major issue outlined in the report is the possibility of \u201clock-in\u201d effects. This happens when AI developers rely heavily on a single cloud service provider for their essential resources, such as computing power and storage. Over-reliance on one provider could make it nearly impossible for developers to switch to other platforms or use multiple providers. This lack of flexibility might limit innovation and growth opportunities for smaller AI startups.\n\nThe FTC also points to the risks associated with sharing sensitive data between cloud providers and AI developers. Such information could include AI development techniques, customer data, and even financial details. If one company gains exclusive access to this data, it could gain an unfair advantage over competitors. This could leave smaller companies struggling to compete on equal terms, further reducing competition and slowing the pace of innovation in the industry.\n\nAlso read: ANI sues OpenAI over using its content for training ChatGPT models\n\nMicrosoft, which has an exclusive deal to host OpenAI\u2019s AI models on its Azure cloud servers, has defended its collaboration. Rima Alaily, Microsoft\u2019s deputy general counsel, stated that the partnership has resulted in groundbreaking AI advancements and significant investments in the field. She described OpenAI as one of the most successful AI startups globally.\n\nDespite Microsoft\u2019s defence, the FTC remains cautious. The report emphasises the need for regulators to closely monitor such partnerships to ensure they don\u2019t harm competition or create an uneven playing field in the AI market."

            "article_content": "Johns Hopkins APL Looks at Machine Learning for LPBF\n\nMadeleine P. Published on January 21, 2025 by\n\nResearchers at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) have developed a new approach that integrates 3D printing with machine learning, specifically for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Essentially, the model allows them to create simulations useful for verifying the production of materials created using LPBF. Machine learning is part of a branch of artificial intelligence and can be applied in various fields, from medical to aerospace.\n\nThe technique devised by APL makes it possible to predict what microstructure will be formed on the printing surface thanks to measurements made on the single layer of powder. To do this, researchers used computational modeling and simulation. These predictions of the object that will be created allow for early intervention in case of errors. This thus not only saves time, materials and costs, but also could exponentially increase the output of materials manufactured through LPBF technology.\n\nThis study is part of a larger body of work being conducted at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory focused on using artificial intelligence to accelerate the discovery of new materials for extreme environments. Morgan Trexler, the liaison for APL\u2019s Science of Extreme and Multifunctional Materials program in the Exploratory Research and Development Mission Area, commented, \u201cWe anticipate that this new approach will be extremely impactful in helping design and understand material formation during additive manufacturing processes, and this fits into our overarching strategy focused on accelerating materials development for national security.\u201d\n\nWhy Use Machine Learning for LPBF\n\nIn LPBF, layers of metal powder are fused by a high-power laser to create three-dimensional objects layer by layer. This technology is useful for producing strong metal parts as well as those with complex geometries. However, because the powders are different from each other and thus have their own characteristics, the processing conditions can undergo many variations, starting with the laser settings and ending with the interactions between the various powder particles. As a result, the properties of the objects being printed can vary greatly.\n\nTo realize this application, the team of researchers led by Li Ma, senior engineer at APL, used a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to accurately measure temperature changes and cooling rates during the printing process as they relate to grain orientation and size. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a discipline that employs computer simulations to predict the behavior of material flows, based on the laws of conservation of mass, momentum and energy. This innovative approach makes it possible not only to predict the microstructure of the part before printing, but also to estimate the mechanical properties of the material and the physical performance of the finished part.\n\nAli Ramazani developed the first phase-field microstructural formation model by integrating the results obtained from the CFD model. This approach improved the accuracy and validity of the simulations. However, its contribution, while significant, was not sufficient to solve all the data collection issues. Indeed, the production of a single component using LPBF technology involves millions of interactions between powder and laser, requiring an enormous amount of computational time and thus making the simulation of each small section extremely complex.\n\nThe breakthrough came from Hudson Liu, an intern in the APL Student Program to Inspire, Relate, and Enrich (ASPIRE) and a high school student at the Gilman School in Baltimore. He theorized a machine learning model that would greatly reduce the need to run expensive simulations. Liu integrated several pre-existing machine learning models to develop what the team calls a \u201cdiffusion probabilistic field model.\u201d This model generates images based on the cooling rate and thermal gradient of LPBF printing, quantifying temperature changes based on parameters such as the distance between the laser impact point and the surrounding solid metal.\n\nHudson Liu said, \u201cThe key benefit of using a model is its speed. Our model can approximate in seconds or minutes what would take hours in a simulation,\u201d adding, \u201cThis allows researchers to quickly explore a wide range of parameters and at much lower cost.\u201d The model was validated through microscopic analyzes of LPBF material. Training of the Machine Learning program required more than 400 simulations performed at APL.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nThe research team is already working to train new models using video data, which will allow microstructures to be predicted in both 3D and 2D. In time, it will then be possible to make predictions of the microstructures of larger components and to analyze the results of more laser passes.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. The project, which came about through internal funding at the university, has been the subject of interest from NASA\u2019s Space Technology Research Institute (STRI), which would like to implement it for its own services. Li Ma said, \u201cNASA wants validated models that can help them predict what will happen in a build, and how the subsequent part will perform, without expensive experimentation. So this approach is valuable, particularly when you think about doing additive manufacturing on the Moon or in space, where experimentation becomes so expensive that it\u2019s effectively impossible.\u201d It will therefore come as no surprise if in the near future we hear about the applications of APL implemented not only in NASA space travel, but also in other areas.\n\nWhat do you think about the use of Machine Learning with LPBF 3D printing?

            "article_content": "Despite all the incentives to buy, the PC market remains at a weak level. Only 245.4 million desktop PCs and notebooks with Windows, macOS and Chrome OS were sold in 2024. This is according to a preliminary estimate by market observer Gartner.\n\nAnzeige\n\nCompared to 2023, the PC market grew by 1.3%. There was no significant upward trend towards the end of the year either: in the fourth quarter, manufacturers sold 64.4 million devices \u2013 1.4 percent more than at the end of 2023. Gartner does not look at the distribution between desktop PCs and notebooks; the ratio is typically around 1:3.\n\nBefore 2023, more than 250 million computers were sold each year. In 2020 and 2021, the level was particularly high at more than 300 million units due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGartner always publishes preliminary figures on the PC market at the beginning of the year. As a rule, these estimates are already accurate. (Image: heise online)\n\nMany incentives do not help\n\nMicrosoft and all major notebook manufacturers have been focusing their marketing efforts on AI computers with Copilot+ since 2024. So far, however, only a few seem to be interested. Intel's announcement that it will have delivered a good 1.5 million Lunar Lake processors (Core Ultra 200V) with an AI unit in 2024 fits in with this. Qualcomm's ARM processors from the Snapdragon X series are expected to be even lower. The market share of Copilot+ PCs is therefore around one percent.\n\nThe approaching end of support for Windows 10 this coming October is also not encouraging new purchases. Microsoft only supports Windows 11 from Intel's Core i-8000 and AMD's Ryzen 2000. Windows 11 can only be installed with tricks on all systems with older CPUs. Without Windows 11, however, private users will no longer receive any important security updates.\n\nAnzeige\n\nMeanwhile, the figures for the second half of 2024 are glossed over by subsidies in China. Among other things, the government is promoting new purchases of desktop PCs and notebooks through trade-in bonuses: Since August, anyone handing in an old device has received a 15 percent refund on the new computer. China is planning further such programs for 2025.\n\nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt Mit Ihrer Zustimmung wird hier ein externer Preisvergleich (heise Preisvergleich) geladen.

Oh, and they're the largest shark in history.\n\nSome fans think that the megalodon is back (Getty Stock Photo)\n\nBut some think that they could be back as a documentary about the megalodon that aired on the Discovery Channel back in 2013.\n\nIt was titled Megalodon: The Shark Lives, and after resurfacing recently on YouTube, a lot of people seem to think that the chilling footage in the video could be telling about the pre-historic creature.\n\nAdvert\n\nWith over seven million views, the video gruesomely shows a blue whale carcass that is beached off the coast of Hawaii, that looks to have been brutally attacked.\n\nOriginally filmed in 2009, the blue whale's insides can be seen hanging out after being cut open by a predator, despite being the biggest animal in the world.\n\nThis photo allegedly shows a six foot fin (Discovery Channel)\n\nA talking head the programme introduces as a marine biologist explained that the culprit had to be the size of a megalodon, as other scenes in the documentary claimed to show six foot tall fins poking out of the ocean near similar blue whale attacks, as people believed that megalodon could still be around.\n\nAdvert\n\nOne user wrote in the comments: \"Six percent of the ocean has been explored, still no sign of the megalodon, but that's only 6%. Megalodon could still be alive.\"\n\nAnother added: \"I believe in megalodon because we just explored 5% Of The Ocean... Its Lurking Down There....\"\n\nBut a third pointed out: \"Megalodon was a surface dweller, I'm sure we'd of [sic] spotted it by now.\"\n\nAnd a fourth also said about one of the scenes: \"That whale died and its guts exploded.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nGraphic images of dead whales were used in the documentary (Discovery/YouTube)\n\nBut despite all of this footage and a whole documentary suggesting that the megalodon could have returned, a brief disclaimer at the start of the show said that the potential return of the species was not based on fact.\n\nThe whole documentary was actually fake, or fiction, rather.\n\nDiscovery Channel viewers couldn't believe it when they found out that Megalodon: The Shark Lives wasn't based on any actual scientific research, but instead used edited footage to make viewers believe that megalodon could still be in our waters.\n\nAdvert\n\nAsk any respected marine biologist though, and they'll tell you that this isn't the case.\n\nShark expert David Shiffman was one person who certainly wasn't happy about the documentary, telling National Geographic it was a 'fiasco' and 'utter nonsense'."

The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) has identified the site as a significant Roman and Byzantine-era location, possibly a monastery.\n\nThe site, which dates back to the fifth or sixth century C.E., reveals a wealth of artifacts, including a winepress, a large warehouse, and imported goods like metal, glass containers, coins, and marble objects. Excavation managers Shira Lifshitz and Maayan Margulis told Smithsonian Magazine that the site is \u201cThe largest and most significant discovery in the region from the Roman and Byzantine periods.\u201d\n\nThe mosaic floor, located in what is believed to be the monastery\u2019s main aisle, features intricate designs of crosses, lions, doves, flowers, geometric patterns, and an amphora (an ancient jug). These artistic elements, combined with the Biblical inscription, suggest the site was of considerable importance.\n\nThe site was continuously occupied from the early Roman period (around the first century C.E.) to the late Byzantine period in the sixth century. Archaeologists believe its first human activity may date back 6,000 years to the Chalcolithic era.\n\nThis discovery sheds light on the spread of Christianity during the Byzantine Empire\u2019s golden age. Following Emperor Constantine I\u2019s conversion to Christianity in the fourth century C.E., the Byzantine Empire became a hub of religious and cultural development.\n\nThe IAA continues to work on preserving the site and its artifacts, offering invaluable insights into the history of the region."

One of the first notable sightings came in 1966 when a mysterious glowing object was seen over Wanaque.\n\nIt started on Jan. 11 when people from many other towns were among callers to police that they saw the strange object over the Wanaque reservoir. Calls came from Ringwood, Totowa, Paterson, Oakland, and even Butler. It was described as between 2 to 9 feet with a light brighter than any star changing from white to red to green and it was reported the object moved in a manner no man-made aircraft could.\n\nWhat made this sighting so credible is the huge number of people reporting it. Even the mayor of Wanaque saw this.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon was terribly strange,\u201d Mayor Harry T. Wolfe explained. He described it as an oval object.\n\nWitness calls came in from a 20-mile radius.

Unearthed from the arid and discovery-rich Pisco basin, this nearly-complete Cosmopolitodus Hastalis fossil highlights the region's significant contributions to understanding prehistoric marine life.\n\nThe shark's fossilized remains, including a jaw equipped with teeth reaching up to 8.9 centimeters, are a testament to the species' dominance in ancient seas. With adults reaching lengths comparable to small boats, these marine giants had a diet chiefly composed of sardines, as evidenced by remnants found within the specimen's stomach.\n\nDuring the presentation, paleontologist Mario Urbina emphasized the rarity of complete shark fossils, enhancing the importance of this discovery. This unveiling follows previous finds in the region, including ancient river dolphin and crocodile fossils, cementing Peru's standing as a pivotal site for paleontological research.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

At the tertiary level, emphasis will be on access, quality, and relevance. At the secondary level, emphasis will be on foundational learning in order that we can produce critical thinkers for the future. There will be a review of pedagogy and curriculum at all levels of education,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe acknowledged the previous government\u2019s efforts since the introduction of the STEM system, revealing the government\u2019s intention to build model STEM schools in every region across the country.\n\n\u201cI should note the effort you have done in getting STEM, we intend to build at least one model STEM school in every region of Ghana, which will span from kindergarten to Senior High School to produce individuals for the future of work,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nHe added that there is a need to train more individuals in Science, Information and Communication Technology, and Engineering.\n\nHe mentioned that core academic objective modules will not be compromised while focusing on the industrial sector.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "article_content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nFor children today, artificial intelligence (AI) won't be a marvel or a menace\u2014it will simply be there. As unremarkable as Wi-Fi or running water. It's not a question of whether they'll adapt to AI; they're already growing up with it.\n\nAlexa's voice mingles with bedtime stories. ChatGPT drafts homework outlines. Google Home turns on the lights and plays morning playlists.\n\nAI is settling into family homes, classrooms, and even cribs, not as an anomaly but as a quiet companion.\n\nMy daughter is growing up with humans and AI. Literally. She just turned one and already recognises her mom, her dad, and her AI assistant. We have the Amazon Alexa at home, and my partner and I use Siri on our iPhones all the time. As a result, she sees AI as a natural part of her life. Alexa and Siri are two names she is familiar with, just like 'Mama' and 'Papaa.'\n\nWhen she cries, we say, \"Alexa, tell Raaha to stop crying,\" Alexa blinks blue and green, luring her to think it's her friend. And she stops crying.\n\nWhen tears roll down her cheeks, Alexa's soothing lullabies often succeed where parenting hacks fail. A simple command transforms chaos into calm. This isn't the splashy tech revolution futurists warned about.\n\nDon't forget the foundation. AI here is not forced. It didn't announce itself. It's here to weave itself into the fabric of daily life. Like a flawless merger.\n\nA decade ago, Skype calls felt like science fiction; toddlers swipe through virtual classrooms today without batting an eye.\n\nSimilarly, today's AI-powered toys, chatbots, and voice assistants will become as banal as microwaves by the time Generation Alpha enters middle school. The shift is happening in the mundane moments.\n\nAlgorithms suggest learning apps tailored to individual needs. Toys respond to emotional cues, fostering a strange form of companionship. And yet, these tools are less about transforming life and more about streamlining it. For today's kids, there's no awe or fear. It's just life.\n\nAI's creeping omnipresence creates a paradox.\n\nOn one hand, it's a miracle of modernity. Need a quick science lesson? AI tutors have you covered. Want to track developmental milestones? Machine learning apps will cheerfully send reminders. But this efficiency comes at a cost. If Alexa answers every curious \"why,\" will children still learn the joy of discovery? If empathy is simulated, will they grasp the depth of real human connection?\n\nAlso Read: AI in the real world\n\nI wrestle with these questions daily. I marvel at AI's ability to ease daily burdens. As a sceptic, I wonder: Are we outsourcing too much? AI may smooth the edges of chaos, but it also raises a nagging fear\u2014what happens when the lines between human and machine blur too much?\n\nOutside the home, the AI ecosystem is reshaping every facet of society. Schools are piloting AI tutors that promise personalised education, a far cry from one-size-fits-all classrooms. In healthcare, AI tools detect patterns in patient data, offering diagnostics faster than human doctors. Even our social interactions are subtly guided by recommendation algorithms dictating what we see, read, and share.\n\nBut with ubiquity comes complacency. Who ensures these systems remain ethical while children grow up surrounded by invisible, algorithmic hands? Bias in AI is no theoretical issue. A 2019 study found that facial recognition software misidentified Black and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more frequently than white ones. When these systems shape our children's realities, vigilance isn't optional\u2014it's imperative.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe next frontier for AI isn't innovation\u2014it's normalisation. Systems will become more personalised, more humanlike, and more integrated into the spaces we inhabit. Picture this: smart homes seamlessly adapting to moods, smart cities optimising every resource, and AI tools that learn not just how we think but how we feel. Our children will inherit this reality\u2014a world where AI doesn't stand out; it blends in.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI will be part of their lives. It's whether it will shape them more than they shape it.\n\nA Quiet Revolution, Carefully Tended\n\nIt's to make life a little smoother, a little easier quietly. As parents, educators, professionals and citizens, our responsibility is to ensure this transition is thoughtful and deliberate. AI shouldn't raise our children. It should support us in raising them.\n\nIn business, think of AI as a dependable assistant. It simplifies tasks, spots problems, and lets leaders focus on big-picture decisions. It's not the boss; the behind-the-scenes helper keeps everything running smoothly.\n\nIn education, AI works like a helpful tutor. It finds where students struggle and offers the right tools to support them. But the teacher inspires creativity, critical thinking, and emotional growth\u2014skills no machine can truly replace.\n\nAlso Read: Human intelligence must guide artificial intelligence\n\nFor now, I'll keep asking Alexa to play lullabies when the chaos peaks. But I'll also keep asking myself harder questions. Will this ecosystem of AI enhance our humanity\u2014or dilute it? The answer, perhaps, lies in how we choose to nurture this strange, quiet revolution. Maybe it's not as scary as it's portrayed in the movies, as it's quietly evolving into our regular ecosystem anyway.\n\nPersonally, I'm okay with AI if it can help my baby stop crying. More okay with it helping me automate the most boring task in my profession."
