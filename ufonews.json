            "article_content": "On the night of August 10, 2022, five pilots on two separate commercial airline flights were wholly convinced they\u2019d documented proof of an Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP) over the Pacific Ocean. Pilots from both flights reported seeing odd lights zipping through the sky\u2014but the single incident they all witnessed turned out to be Starlink telecommunications satellites.\n\nIn recent years, pilots\u2014as well as the public\u2014have mistakenly identified these low-Earth orbit satellites as UAPs. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of 69 reports just from January 23\u2013April 27, 2023 that identify \u201cUFO-UAP,\u201d and according to one paper , more than a third of them could be Starlink satellites. Unfortunately, such mysterious sightings lead to pilot confusion and potential safety consequences because of the distraction and extra chatter about them over the airwaves.\n\nThe core issue with pilots misidentifying satellites as UAPs stems from the fact that pilots cannot access real-time data about satellite movements, leaving them unprepared to recognize strange lights in the sky. These satellites may appear to move in unexpected ways, based on their orientation, and they may also appear and disappear, since their solar arrays reflect sunlight at different angles when deployed, relative to the pilot\u2019s position in flight.\n\nStarlink satellites orbit about 342 miles above Earth, according to Starlink\u2019s website, and that places them lower than most other satellites, making them visible to our eyes as spots of light, no magnification needed. More than 6,000 Starlink satellites are currently circling Earth, and the SpaceX-owned company aims to eventually have 42,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit, which means pilots will need to have surefire methods for identifying them.\n\n\n\nGetty Images The passage of Starlink satellites is seen in the sky over southern Poland on November 1, 2024.\n\nFour scientists want to fill the information gap in this type of situation to prevent unnecessary aviation risk. Led by mechanical engineer Douglas J. Buettner of the University of Utah, the team devised a method to simulate the exact locations of satellites, and they proposed plans that would provide pilots with the information they need to quickly identify satellites. Their paper describing this work was accepted at the 2024 International Academy of Astronautics Conference on Space Situational Awareness (ICSSA).\n\nTo shed some light on what the five pilots saw, the scientists conducted an \u201castrometric analysis\u201d of their reports, using two cell phone photos and a video the pilots had taken of \u201can unrecognized and possibly anomalous phenomenon,\u201d according to the paper. To corroborate the data, researchers looked up Starlink\u2019s records, noting that the visual line the satellites created in the sky\u2014called a \u201ctrain\u201d of satellites\u2014launched that same day. The team also used data from the flight, including photographs taken in the cockpit. Using these pieces of information and an orbital mechanics software tool, they were able to reconstruct the August 10 cockpit view. It showed Starlink satellites matching both the time and place of the sighting.\n\nTheir analysis used a technique called \u201cray-traced rendering\u201d of the view from the pilots\u2019 cockpit, which provided a more visual simulation of exactly where the pilots saw the satellites through their cockpit windows, according to the paper. The simulation experiments indicated that the satellites\u2019 solar arrays must have been deployed, likely making them glint brightly enough for the pilots in both aircraft to notice them. \u201cIn the implementation of our approach, we were able to closely match the apparent speed in degrees per second traveled by the object between the two photographs taken by one of the pilots,\u201d the scientists wrote.\n\nThe team hopes that their work demonstrates a plan that could plausibly \u201cwarn aviators and the public about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations,\u201d and therefore support aviation safety, they wrote. In the future, it\u2019s worth studying how the deployment of a satellite\u2014as well as its surface materials\u2014affects the way it reflects sunlight, the paper adds. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said on X that the satellite orientation could be adjusted to minimize solar reflection during astronomical experiments, though the team\u2019s paper does not specifically address this possibility.\n\nThe authors do suggest various procedures and technologies that aircraft could deploy to support accurate UAP identification. For example, pilots should be allowed to \u201croutinely provide photographic evidence from either an automated system when they are busy with safety critical aircraft operations, or using cell phones when they are not allowed,\u201d to greatly improve UAP analysis.\n\nSatellite operators should also provide information about satellite movements\u2014such as orientation, orbit location, and deployment timelines\u2014to support more accurate and detailed models, the scientists write. Finally, they suggest a way for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reduce in-flight risks due to pilots trying to determine the source of a UAP. Air traffic controllers could have access to a satellite-modeling system that would enable them to anticipate satellite sightings and alert the pilots when necessary. \u201cWe envision this as a collaborative effort between the satellite\u2019s owners (in this case SpaceX/Starlink), the FAA, NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Space Force,\u201d the authors note.\n\nAs for people on the ground, anyone can find Starlink in the sky. Look up on a clear, dark night, and if you see a white light or \u201ctrain\u201d of lights moving across the sky, go to FindStarlink.com. You can search for your time and location and determine if what you see is indeed Starlink satellites."

Toby told guests: \"None of you will of stayed in anything like this before\".\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nFollowing the show's usual format, three lots of B&B owners came to stay at Toby's campsite in Wales. The first guest to arrive is B&B owner, James Earl who said that Toby is \"absolutely insane\", as he is presented with his bed for the night in a UFO. The incredibly unique accommodation costs \u00a3169 per night, with breakfast being an additional \u00a315.\n\nJames is completely surprised by the madness of his UFO, as the next guests, Ryan Blackman and his manager, Sarah Hitchin, are shown to their 'Pac-Man' inspired digs. Ryan said: \"It's crazy isn't it. But I love it\". The 'Pac-Man' costs \u00a395, and \u00a310 for breakfast.\n\nThe UFO accommodation at Apple Camping in Pembrokeshire (Image: Channel 4 )\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nFinally, B&B owners Susanne Fox and Anwen Roberts arrive at Apple Camping. Susanne said that Toby has a \"wacky character\" and expected his campsite to be the same. The two friends landed on the 'Airbus' accommodation. They said \"Oh Wow! It's very retro and it's more than I expected\". The plane is the most expensive accommodation per night, costing \u00a3179 a night.\n\nPac-Man accommodation atApple Camping (Image: Channel 4 )\n\nThe guests asked how much the showstopper plane cost him to put on the campsite. Toby wouldn't reveal an exact cost but said: \"It paid for itself within two years\".\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThroughout the episode, all of the guests seemed to be enjoying the unique element of their stay. However, breakfast proved to be a disappointment for Ryan, Sarah and James. Toby had a DIY theme, providing guests with a box of random food items to cater for themselves. However, Susanne and Anwen enjoyed a luxury 'first class breakfast' on the airplane.\n\nThe Airbus accommodation at Apple Camping (Image: Channel 4 )\n\nOverall, the visitors thought Toby was a \"fantastic host\", and Susanne and Anwen descrbed their stay as \"new, retro and spotless\". But the accommodation clearly lacked some basics, including towels and soap. James said he was unhappy at his sink and kettle being outside rather than inside the UFO.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nDespite this, all of the guests said they would return to Apple Camping for another stay. This episode of Four In A Bed was first shown on Channel 4 on Tuesday October 26 2021, but was recently shown again on Tuesday January 8 2025."

            "article_content": "George Clinton\u2019s real UFO encounters: \u201cIf you ain\u2019t got no booty, what do you shake?\u201d\n\nPeople weren\u2019t meant to be this informed all the time. It\u2019s quite literally not natural for us to know this much information and have such a big-picture view of the world. For most of us, we have to focus on what we ourselves can change for the sake of our own mental health. Having too much of a big-picture view of the world will only stress us out. That said, we could go the George Clinton way, take the big picture to such a degree that we all become one, and see just how ludicrous it is to care about our petty differences.\n\nClinton sums this up best in an interview with Rolling Stone. When asked about white artists performing Black music, he is fairly supportive of the idea: \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to learn from each other, blend from each other, and it moves around like that.\u201d So far, so down to earth. Suddenly, that figurative statement becomes literal in the funniest way possible.\n\nAdding, \u201cWe gonna be dealing with aliens. You think Black and white gonna be a problem? Wait till you start running into motherfuckers with three of four dicks!\u201d\n\nA good point well made, George. You see, Clinton didn\u2019t just use the whole sci-fi/afrofuturism vibe of Parliament/Funkadelic as an image. He\u2019s all in on the idea of life beyond the stars because, if you ask him about it, he\u2019s met them in person.\n\nHe goes on to talk about an alien encounter he had with bass icon Bootsy Collins. Right from the off, he answers the question that all of us would have and says, \u201cWe weren\u2019t high.\u201d He says the two of them were driving together after a morning fishing trip, and at around midday, \u201cA light hit the car, and a substance like mercury out of the thermometer rolled up the side of the car.\u201d\n\nIn a further interview with the YouTube channel Nowness, he expanded on what happened next: \u201cWe just drove up to my house\u2026 my daughter came outside and said to us, \u2018Y\u2019all look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u2019\u201d Then it gets really weird. Years later, he recalled that, shortly after they got back, his daughter \u201cwas talking about going to bed. We\u2019d (gone fishing) around 9:30 or 10 in the morning. Why would she be going to bed? Time was amiss; we\u2019d never even contemplated the time being missing.\u201d\n\nIn the same conversation, he goes on to talk about how rather than these visitors being invaders or colonisers, he likes to believe they\u2019re our ancestors. That they\u2019re a shared part of our DNA that can help bring us together. Which is the core of all this. For all his talk about out-there concepts we\u2019d normally find in sci-fi films, to him, this is about us realising all that we have in common.\n\nIt makes no sense to discuss the concept of \u2018white music\u2019 and \u2018Black music\u2019 when it should be all about how much we, as humans, can connect with each other. It\u2019s a charming thought, one put best later in the same interview. When asked what he\u2019d like to say to these aliens if given the chance, he says he\u2019d like to ask, \u201cHow do y\u2019all dance? If you ain\u2019t got no booty, what do you shake?\u201d\n\nReal talk, it\u2019s a question we could do a whole lot of good by asking each other first."

I was sure that Lockport was rich and full of history, so we did some research and talked to some people and we've done quite a few places,\" Sanders said.\n\nSo far Sander's visited such spots like Marjim Manor, Van Horn Mansion, Cold Springs Cemetery, Dunkirk Lighthouse and Stooges, the old City Hall.\n\nSanders said he has plans to visit even more ghostly sites, including Graestone Manor in Gasport.\n\nWhile the ghosts in Lockport seem more \"intrigued\" by him than \"aggressive\" Sanders said that was fine with him. He's still testing new ground in the world of the paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Some of these places I've done have never been investigated by anybody before. I think they're more intrigued here than aggressive, unlike the places I've been on the West Coast. Those are used to tourism because some of those places out west are mainstream ghost hunting places. Here in Lockport that's not the case,\" he said.\n\nSanders began his own ghost hunting with a curiosity of what's unknown \u2014 the big questions like \"what happens when we die?\" \u2014 as well as a drive to find out for himself. There's millions of ghost hunting shows out there, Sanders said. He wanted to see if it was real.\n\nUsing a wide variety of tools, including \"spirit dice,\" as well as white noise boxes and light-up \"rem pods\" that he buys online, Sanders said that depending on the intelligence of the ghost he's trying to communicate with, different kinds of equipment are used.\n\n\"You usually run into a residual haunting or an intelligent haunting and typically an intelligent haunting can give you intelligent conversation through some of the equipment,\" he said. \"A residual haunting is supposedly a spirit that's almost stuck in a time loop and the spirit is not able to communicate, but we are able to pick up the presence of spirit.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, to even get close to the ghosts, Sanders said he has to get permission. Which can be a strange thing to ask. Such was the case of the old City Hall, now Stooges restaurant.\n\n\"I walked through the front door and I could feel the sensation of some sort of activity there and I walked up to the girls who were working at the front counter \u2014 and sometimes its a very awkward question to ask about the paranormal \u2014but I asked them. I said, 'I have an odd question for you, is this place haunted?' They all started laughing,\" he said.\n\nAs it turns out, after investigating, there was no \"concrete evidence\" of intelligence hauntings in Stooges, but Sanders was able to get evidence of \"something\" in the attic.\n\n\"We set a device upstairs in the attic, in which most of the activity, from the employees and the people that have been in there eating have said they heard. That was the only place I was able to get any concrete evidence of something up there,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther places were a little more spooky, including the house in Cold Springs Cemetery. There, Sanders was unable to get responses, but one of his friends, a camera woman named Jen Craft, was able to get answers from children that were haunting the second floor.\n\n\"She was getting intelligent responses through the devices we were using, confirming there were children upstairs in the Cold Springs Cemetery house,\" Sanders said.\n\nSanders said he intends to stay in the area until May and he and his friends will be checking out everything \"haunted\" in the meantime.\n\n\"I will be discussing with the group on dates, holidays and when they're off (for more ghost hunting trips),\" he said."

            "article_content": "Two young girls who were grief-stricken at the loss of their mum from cancer were left horrified after discovering the source of \"tapping\" in the walls.\n\nKaren and Tina Bowen, aged nine and 15 respectively, were spending a lot of time home alone after their mother\u2019s death as their dad, Frank Bowen, had to work two jobs to replace his wife\u2019s income. Podcaster Mr Ballen describes how Tina told her younger sister: \u201cWhy don't we get our Ouija board out and have a s\u00e9ance? Let's try to communicate with mum and see if she manipulates the board and gives us a sign that she's here with us.\u201d\n\nBut, almost immediately after their paranormal experiment, they started hearing an eerie tapping sound coming from the basement of their home in Townsend, Massachusetts. Later that night, when Frank Bowen arrived home fro work, he was surprised to see his daughters still up and about \u2013 and listened patiently to their takes of a supernatural visitation from their late mum.\n\nImage: Boston Globe via Getty Images) Boston Globe via Getty Images)\n\nFrank put their stories down to natural grief, and a lively imagination, but the tapping continued. Mr Ballen explains: \u201cOver the next few days, is the tapping sounds in the house would continue, and they were no longer just coming from the basement.\n\n\u201cThey were also coming from the kitchen. They were coming sometimes from the second floor. They were coming from all over the house. But the girls were the only ones who could hear the sounds.\u201d\n\nAfter a few days, though, the girls were no longer excited by the mysterious tapping sound. They were terrified. Especially as it seemed to be no longer confined to the basement, but could be heard all over the the house.\n\nEventually, Karen and Tina plucked up the courage to go down to the basement to see if they could identify the source of the sound, half-expecting to find a racoon or other small animal trapped down there. Tina armed herself with a kitchen knife and led the way.\n\nImage: Boston Globe via Getty Images) Boston Globe via Getty Images)\n\nBut after a brief search, their nerve deserted them and they began to make their way back upstairs. It was on they way back up to their bedroom that they found a terrifying message scrawled on the wall. In dripping red lettering, it read \u201cI\u2019M IN YOUR CLOSET. COME FIND ME.\u201d\n\nThe terrified pair ran straight out of the house and took refuge with one of their neighbours. They stayed there until Frank got home, and then breathlessly told him the whole story. Frank concluded that his daughters\u2019 grief had push them into a dangerous delusion, and resolved then and there to organise some counselling for them.\n\nThe chilling message on the wall was real enough, written in ketchup, but Frank could only assume that one of the girls had written it themselves in a bid for attention.\n\nAfter the counselling sessions began, a few weeks went by with no more tapping, and the Bowens began to feel as if whatever had been plaguing them, was now over.\n\nImage: Boston Globe via Getty Images) Boston Globe via Getty Images)\n\nBut a few weeks later, in December 1986, the mystery unravelled in a deeply disturbing way. Frank had taken his daughters and their friend Kathleen out for a meal. When they got home, the house was lit up \u2013 with lights on in several rooms and the TV blaring. Still, in the back of his mind suspecting that his daughters had somehow engineered this \u201chaunting\u201d, he began to carefully explore his house.\n\nNot only were all the lights on, but Frank noticed that some of the furniture had been moved around. Mr Ballen explains: \u201cHe\u2019s thinking to himself \u2018They've been with me. We've been out of the house. How could they do this?\u2019 But again, Frank is caught. On the one hand, he knows this could be his girls, but he's also thinking, \u2018I think that's not possible\u2019.\u201d\n\nRoom by room, Frank went through the house \u2013 even peering into the attic and basement \u2013 but finding nothing. Until he checked one final room on the ground floor: \u201cFrank goes into this room, and right away, he sees on the wall right in front of him, written in shaving cream, are the words \u201cMARRY ME.\u201d. Frank's staring at them being like, What is this? Who wrote this? The girls, again, are right behind him, tucked up against the back of his legs.\"\n\nImage: YouTube/MrBallen) YouTube/MrBallen)\n\n\u201cAs he's doing that. He hears movement in the closet, in the room that he's in. Frank turns and he looks at this closet. The doors are open to this closet, but it's a dark closet. And out of the closet, walks a man who is wearing a dress, Frank's dead wife's dress. This person had clown makeup on their face, and they were wielding a hatchet.\u201d\n\nThe three girls fled upstairs, with Frank protecting them as they retreated. Tina, the older girl, threw herself out of the bedroom window into the garden, running to the neighbour\u2019s house in order to call the police.\n\nBy the time officers arrived, the mystery attacker had disappeared, leaving his hatchet behind as the only evidence that he had been there. But police took the case seriously and arranged for the Bowens to stay somewhere else for a few days while they monitored the house to see if the man returned.\n\nWhen Frank popped back to pick up some clean clothes, a day or two later, he was surprised to find that there was no police car outside his door. He did, however, see some movement at a first-floor window and assumed that the officers were, for some reason, searching his house again. He called the local police station to be sure. They told him there was no reason for an officer to be inside his house, and told him to wait until another police car could be sent.\n\nImage: Boston Globe via Getty Images) Boston Globe via Getty Images)\n\nThe cop, who had simply been a little late starting his shift, warily went inside. \u201cHe opens it up, he looks inside, and he can't believe what he's looking at,\u201d said Mr Ballen. \u201cIn the first floor of Frank's house, it's just madness. There are pennies glued to the ceiling of the first floor, and the furniture clearly has been moved all over the place, but it's been stacked in these weird arrangements.\n\n\u201cThere are glasses of champagne all over the first floor, and there are kitchen knives that have been driven into family photos on the wall. Like the knives are still sticking into the photo, and where these knives have been driven through the photo is always on a picture of either Tina or Karen, the two daughters. Where there are knives in these pictures, above those pictures is written, \u2018I'm going to kill you, Tina,\u2019 or \u2018I'm going to kill you, Karen.\u2019 This officer obviously knows we have a problem here. He backs out of the house and he calls for reinforcements.\u201d\n\nA second search of the Bowen home turned up nothing. Until one of the investigators, leaning on a washing machine in the basement, noticed a hole in the wall behind and is greeted with a chilling sight: \u201cLooking back at this officer is Danny LaPlante. He's crouched down, he's got a hatchet over his shoulder, he's wearing a dress, and he's staring back at this officer.\u201d\n\nLaPlante was a 16-year-old who attended the same school as Tina. He had apparently asked her out and been turned down, although she didn\u2019t remember even speaking to him. He had broken into the Bowens\u2019 house and for six months had been living in their walls.\n\nImage: Sourced) Sourced)\n\nLaPlante was arrested, but 10 months later he was freed on bail while he awaited trial. It was then that he broke into another house in the town, the home of the Gustafson family.\n\nWhen 33-year-old Priscilla Gustafson returned home and surprised LaPlante, he tied her to a bed, raped and shot her, then drowned her children, 7-year-old Abigail and 5-year-old William, in a bathtub.\n\nAndrew Gustafson discovered the bodies of his wife and children when he returned home from work that day.\n\nLaPlante was arrested for the crime and originally sentenced to life in prison without parole, before lawyers argued that because he was a juvenile, that sentence was unconstitutional.\n\nHe remains behind bars. Mr Ballen concluded: \u201cHe was actually put up for parole recently. He didn't get it. But during his hearing for his parole, when he was rejected, he said he was determined to be one of the most psychopathic inmates in the entire prison system.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Part of what makes The Sims 4 such an enduring favorite among cozy gamers is that the options for how to play are basically endless. For some, it\u2019s all about Create a Sim, while others spend hours building their dream house in Build Mode. And then, there\u2019s always those generational challenges, carefully crafted a legacy family with specific rules and specifications. But it\u2019s not just Simmers who have endless options in The Sims 4. Their Sims have a true wealth of options when it comes to their chosen career, and some are better than others.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nFor those who have the game fully loaded with Expansion Packs, there are over 50 career options in The Sims 4. While some are part-time ways for teenage Sims to earn a few Simoleons, many are in-depth adventures up the career ladder to the covered Career Level 10. But which Sims 4 careers are the very best? Based on their depth and engagement, these 10 top the list.\n\n1. Reaper\n\nA Reaper gets to work in The Sims 4 Life & Death\n\nExpansion: Life & Death\n\nThe Reaper career is the newest addition to The Sims 4, and it shows. This career brings everything gamers love about Active careers, while polishing up some of the issues that earlier careers bring into play. Starting as a Grimtern and working their way up, Sims in this career field learn to reap souls and comfort the beloved they\u2019ve left behind.\n\nDoes it get a little bit repetitive eventually? Yes. But there are a good variety of daily tasks and showing up to work with The Grim Reaper himself never quite gets old.\n\n2. Detective\n\nClose the case in Sims 4: Get to Work\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nAn oldie but still a goodie, the Detective career was one of the first Active options in The Sims 4. In this job, Sims spend each day collecting clues to solve cases \u2013 with the active help of the big gamer in the sky, of course.\n\nThis is quite an involved career, with players engaged in tasks like visiting crime scenes and interrogating suspects. For those looking to feel involved in their Sims\u2019 career paths, it\u2019s a must.\n\n3. Doctor\n\nScanning patients is part of a day\u2019s work in The Sims 4 doctor career\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nAnother entry from the original trio of Active careers is the Doctor role. Starting with patient intake and cleaning a lot of hospital beds, Sims work their way up to diagnosing and treating patients over time.\n\nThe tasks for this career can get repetitive once you reach the higher ranks, but it\u2019s nearly always entertaining. It\u2019s also hard work, with many steps to diagnose each patient before the day is done. Unfortunately, the Doctor career remains glitchy to this day, but that doesn\u2019t fully remove its charm.\n\n4. Freelancer\n\nFreelance candlemaking is a thing in Eco Lifestyle\n\nExpansion: Base Game, with more options from packs like Paranormal Stuff and Eco Lifestyle\n\nJust like in real life, the Freelancer career comes with its pros and minuses in The Sims 4. Your Sim will sign up with a specific agency based on their skills, from becoming a Freelance Writer, Crafter, or Artist down to investigating the Paranormal.\n\nThe Freelancer career can be glitchy, but when it works, it\u2019s very engaging. Sims will accept and complete gigs, with increasingly high-paid options as they successfully finish prior jobs. Ticking off the tasks can keep gamers engaged far more successfully than heading to the office for an Active career.\n\n5. Actor\n\nPut on a show as a Sims 4 actor\n\nExpansion: Get Famous\n\nFor Sims who dream of the spotlight, the Actor career offers an opportunity to rise through the ranks from one-off commercial gigs to their own feature film. Added three years after the initial introduction of Active careers, the Actor profession does away with some of the issues from earlier iterations.\n\nOn-the-job tasks include getting hair and makeup done, getting to know co-stars and the crew, and rehearsing lines before finally filming some scenes. This career offers some flexibility as players can choose which acting gigs their Sim takes on, making it a more dynamic option than straightforward ladder-climbing careers.\n\n6. Interior Decorator\n\nShowing off swatches as a Sims 4 interior decorator\n\nExpansion: Dream Home Decorator\n\nFor those Simmers who spend more time in Build Mode than anywhere else, this is the Active career to go for. As an Interior Decorator, Sims will get to step inside homes around town, remodeling them with new decor and furniture.\n\nThe gameplay for this career involves listening to clients and then getting into the Build Mode nitty gritty to bring them to life. While there isn\u2019t as much variety here as with some other Active careers, it\u2019s a great choice for those who treat The Sims 4 like an interior decorating game anyway.\n\n7. Video Game Streamer\n\nGaming for fun and profit in The Sims 4\n\nExpansion: High School Years\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the inception of it all, but there are few things quite as entertaining as having a Sim get really into gaming. The High School Years expansion added a new part-time career that reflects the reality of streaming as a way to make a living in the modern era.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t as dynamic as an Active career or as in-depth as a full-time profession, the Video Game Streamer job is just a ton of fun. Sims raise that video gaming skill and spend time streaming, earning money through tips from fans and learning the ropes for the Entrepreneurial skill. Whether it\u2019s a gateway to a longer-term Freelance career or your Sim\u2019s supplement during college, this part-time job is one of the best.\n\n8. Culinary\n\nEven home chefs know how to hustle in Sims 4\n\nExpansion: Base Game\n\nSome Simmers are in it for the cooking, as the constant stream of new cooking-centered content for The Sims 4 can attest. The Culinary career has been around from the beginning, but it\u2019s still one of the best thanks to the constant addition of new recipes and ways to prep food.\n\nThe Culinary career isn\u2019t an active one, but players will spend plenty of time cooking or mixing drinks for the daily tasks. With so many recipes to choose from and the recently expanded array of kitchen gadgets, Simmers can really get a lot out of this career even if they\u2019re only with their Sims at home.\n\n9. Business Owner\n\nSell clothes, cupcakes, and more in The Sims 4: Get to Work\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nOwning a business doesn\u2019t always work as EA intended, but it\u2019s still one of the most interesting ways to deeply engage with the work element of The Sims 4. Sims can own a variety of business lots, from retail to bakeries and food carts and beyond.\n\nRunning these businesses is a full-on process, from buying or building the lot to creating and selling merchandise. Set prices, engage with customers, and get ready to earn\u2026 or not. This way of bringing in Simoleons is a bit like owning a real business and will take over the day-to-day, but some Simmers like it that way.\n\n10. Landlord\n\nCollecting rent in The Sims 4 Landlord career\n\nExpansion: For Rent\n\nOpinions on The Sims 4: For Rent are a bit mixed, but the ability to buy Residential Rentals and become a landlord is one of the best things the game offers. It\u2019s incredibly dynamic, with the ability to fill an owned unit with tenants, create house rules, and more.\n\nAs a Property Manager, players enjoy a variety of interactions that let them engage with their tenants, including asking about the living conditions and evicting them. Notifications will bring in various issues that Sims need to manage in their units, keeping gamers on their toes \u2013 sometimes a little too much."

A new study published in the journal Science describes how anthropogenic air pollution impacts the process of the formation of ice from supercooled cloud water droplets, which impacts our climate.\n\n\"There was an 8% reduction in cloud cover and an 18% reduction in cloud optical thickness,\" according to the study. \"Additionally, daily glaciation-induced snowfall accumulations reached 15 millimeters. Glaciation events downwind of industrial aerosol hot spots indicate that anthropogenic aerosols likely serve as ice-nucleating particles.\"\n\nDo you worry about air pollution in your town?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nResearchers studied cloud formations near 67 major industrial sites around the world. They discovered that pollution particles trigger ice formation, leading to snowfall that creates noticeable gaps or holes in cloud cover.\n\nWhy are air pollution's effects on cloud formation important?\n\n\"The findings indicate that industrial aerosols facilitate the formation of ice within clouds rather than just liquid droplets,\" according to the One Green Planet report. \"This ice formation not only contributes to localized snowfall but also affects the physical properties of clouds. Ice-laden clouds cover less area, are thinner, and reflect less sunlight compared to their droplet-only counterparts. This results in darker clouds that absorb more infrared radiation, potentially diminishing the cooling effect typically provided by brighter clouds.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research illuminates the influence of industrial pollutants on weather patterns and their potential implications for climate modeling, a crucial but underexplored component of atmospheric science.\n\nWhat should be done with the information revealed in this groundbreaking study?\n\nThe new study's findings have wide-reaching implications for climate science, highlighting the need for deeper investigation into which pollutants most effectively drive ice nucleation and how to integrate these processes into future climate models.\n\nClimate scientists have their hands full when it comes to studying the impacts of particle pollution on our warming world. A recent Pennsylvania State University study pointed out how microplastics could affect our planet's weather and climate.\n\nThere is little argument that climate models need to be improved. Models failed to explain the record heat observed in 2023. Climate models are essential tools for enhancing our understanding and forecasting of climate behavior across seasonal to centennial time frames.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you believe there are factories near you causing undue pollution, you can also look into getting involved locally through community organizations directly or through donations.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n"

He called the fossil \u201cPunk.\u201d Then he found a similar fossil with downward-tipped spines reminiscent of long, side-swept \u201cemo\u201d bangs. He nicknamed that specimen after the emotional alt-rock genre.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Sutton and his colleagues published a paper in the journal Nature formally naming the creatures as the species Punk ferox and Emo vorticaudum. True to their names, these worm-mollusks are behind something of an upset (if not quite \u201canarchy in the U.K.\u201d) over scientists\u2019 understanding of the origins of one of the biggest groups of animals on Earth.\n\nIn terms of sheer number of species, mollusks are second only to arthropods (the group that contains insects, spiders and crustaceans). The better-known half of the mollusk family tree, conchiferans, contains animals like snails, clams and octopuses. \u201cThe other half is this weird and wacky group of spiny things,\u201d Dr. Sutton said. Some animals in this branch, the aculiferans, resemble armored marine slugs, while others are \u201cobscure, weird molluscan worms,\u201d he said."

Maximize the Value of Your Affiliate Partnerships!\n\nAs digital marketing has evolved over the last couple of decades, companies have used affiliate marketing to drive traffic to their websites and generate sales. This article will explore how affiliate coupon codes can affect your brand and how Bluepear\u2019s advanced brand protection technology can address the challenges while ensuring fair traffic generation.\n\nUnderstanding the Potential Challenges of Coupon Affiliates\n\n1. The Potential Impact of Coupon Codes on Your Marketing Funnel\n\nThese coupon codes often appeal to existing customers instead of attracting new ones. Usually, those who seek out affiliate coupon codes are already familiar with your brand and are ready to make a purchase. These customers likely had the opportunity to learn about your products through ads, organic searches, word of mouth, or an influencer who is affiliated with your program.\n\nThus, affiliate coupon sites can end up at the bottom of the conversion funnel, which can lead to additional costs for traffic that has already been attracted to your site through other channels.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\n2. Coupon Codes Can Lead to Discount-Seeking Behavior & Lower Cart Values\n\nCoupons incentivize discounts merely by their nature. As with many brands, your goal for offering a deal will likely attract new and repeat customers. However, this can also backfire because it teaches consumers to secure the lowest price possible for the products they want. This can result in reduced average order value (AOV) over time, which can impact profitability. Encouraging a reliance on discounts can be an unintentional consequence of coupon affiliates.\n\n3. Customer Frustrations & the Risk to Brand Reputation\n\nCoupon affiliate programs work to accomplish their own business goals, which is to attract a constant stream of traffic to their own websites. To do this, they scrape all the possible codes and distribute them all, whether they are valid or not. This can lead to customers coming across expired coupon codes, which may create a less favorable experience with your brand.\n\n4. A Lack of Transparency in Coupon Code Distribution\n\nA common problem with affiliate coupon sites is that they often fail to disclose the methods of attracting users to their websites. They may be driving traffic through paid search campaigns, deceptive SEO practices, or unapproved partnerships with other websites and marketing platforms. This lack of clarity can make it more difficult for brands to formulate an effective marketing strategy for their affiliate programs.\n\nAffiliates who don\u2019t disclose their network connections and activities leave many brands in the dark about whether their codes are being used in ways that decrease the value of their brand, if and when violations occur, and what specific affiliates or third-party partners engage in the misuse of these codes. This uncertainty can challenge trust and hinder collaborative relationships between brands and affiliate partners.\n\nHow Bluepear Can Help Brands Track Coupon Affiliates\n\nThough coupon affiliate programs are often seen as a challenge in digital marketing, Bluepear can provide a solution with its brand protection technology. Below is a hypothetical brand, \u201cJam,\u201d to illustrate how Bluepear\u2019s technology helps combat affiliate coupon misuse.\n\nStep 1: Identifying Violations\n\nJam has to establish clear guidelines in its affiliate program terms and conditions. These terms include prohibitions on promotion through coupon codes and brand bidding.\n\nThough the policies clearly outline these guidelines, Jam notices that users access codes after searching ads that feature phrases like \u201c20% off Jam coupon.\u201d\n\nStep 2: Using Bluepear to Detect Coupon Misuse\n\nJam partners with Bluepear, and with their help, they are able to gain visibility into how their coupons are being misused. Bluepear makes this possible through tech-driven features:\n\nFiltering for Coupon Codes\n\nBluepear provides Jam with a platform that includes a coupon code filter, which is built to identify all instances in which the brand\u2019s name is associated with coupon advertisements.\n\nAnalyzing Violations\n\nThe Bluepear platform provides a comprehensive analysis that shows specific violators, including insightful information such as screenshots where search results show the brand\u2019s name and mentioned discounts. The platform also captures landing pages where these instances of misuse are found and the affiliate IDs linked to these actions.\n\nBuilding Evidence\n\nBluepear collects and stores all affiliate violations, helping Jam gather the evidence required to address the issue with their affiliate networks or partners.\n\nStep 3: Taking Action\n\nBeyond identifying and collecting proof of coupon code misuse, Bluepear\u2019s system also includes a feature that will send the affiliate a notification letter with attached evidence. This feature will streamline the process of addressing affiliate program misuse, save Jam precious time, and ensure affiliate accountability.\n\nWhy Choose Bluepear for Protecting Your Brand?\n\nBluepear is proud to offer an all-encompassing solution for managing and monitoring partners participating in \u0430ffiliate programs. Its features will empower your brand to:\n\nIdentify Misuse at Scale\n\nBluepear\u2019s analytic tools will help your team unveil any patterns of voucher misuse among your affiliate partners and networks.\n\nEnforce Compliance with Your Terms & Conditions\n\nThe brand can notify affiliates who violate program terms directly through the Bluepear platform. The brand can attach screenshots or links as proof.\n\nOptimize Traffic Generation\n\nWith increased transparency with traffic sources, your brand can ensure that your affiliate coupon codes are being used by new customers only.\n\nPreserve Your Brand\u2019s Reputation\n\nBluepear\u2019s active monitoring of coupon code misuse will help you address the issues of distribution of codes and maintain your brand\u2019s reputation.\n\nMaximize the Value of Your Affiliate Partnerships!\n\nWhile affiliate coupon codes may appear to be a simple and effective way to boost sales, they can come with challenges, including potential impacts on AOV and brand reputation, which may outweigh the perceived benefits. However, with the help of Bluepear, you can regain control over your affiliate program. Discover how Bluepear\u2019s brand technology can safeguard your brand and optimize your affiliate marketing strategy today.\n\nDigital Trends partners with external contributors.

Real-Time Adaptation: The technology continuously updates zip code-specific IntentKey models, dynamically adjusting to reflect changes in consumer needs and market trends.\n\n\n\nInuvo\u2019s advancements are particularly significant as the advertising industry navigates the accelerating deprecation of third-party cookies and other identity-based targeting mechanisms.

A new study published in the journal Science describes how anthropogenic air pollution impacts the process of the formation of ice from supercooled cloud water droplets, which impacts our climate.\n\n\"There was an 8% reduction in cloud cover and an 18% reduction in cloud optical thickness,\" according to the study. \"Additionally, daily glaciation-induced snowfall accumulations reached 15 millimeters. Glaciation events downwind of industrial aerosol hot spots indicate that anthropogenic aerosols likely serve as ice-nucleating particles.\"\n\nDo you worry about air pollution in your town?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nResearchers studied cloud formations near 67 major industrial sites around the world. They discovered that pollution particles trigger ice formation, leading to snowfall that creates noticeable gaps or holes in cloud cover.\n\nWhy are air pollution's effects on cloud formation important?\n\n\"The findings indicate that industrial aerosols facilitate the formation of ice within clouds rather than just liquid droplets,\" according to the One Green Planet report. \"This ice formation not only contributes to localized snowfall but also affects the physical properties of clouds. Ice-laden clouds cover less area, are thinner, and reflect less sunlight compared to their droplet-only counterparts. This results in darker clouds that absorb more infrared radiation, potentially diminishing the cooling effect typically provided by brighter clouds.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research illuminates the influence of industrial pollutants on weather patterns and their potential implications for climate modeling, a crucial but underexplored component of atmospheric science.\n\nWhat should be done with the information revealed in this groundbreaking study?\n\nThe new study's findings have wide-reaching implications for climate science, highlighting the need for deeper investigation into which pollutants most effectively drive ice nucleation and how to integrate these processes into future climate models.\n\nClimate scientists have their hands full when it comes to studying the impacts of particle pollution on our warming world. A recent Pennsylvania State University study pointed out how microplastics could affect our planet's weather and climate.\n\nThere is little argument that climate models need to be improved. Models failed to explain the record heat observed in 2023. Climate models are essential tools for enhancing our understanding and forecasting of climate behavior across seasonal to centennial time frames.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you believe there are factories near you causing undue pollution, you can also look into getting involved locally through community organizations directly or through donations.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n"

They claim Musk started his artificial intelligence company, xAI, to compete directly with OpenAI.\n\n\u201cHe says a lot of things, starts them, undoes them, gets sued, sues, gets in fights with the government, gets investigated by the government. That\u2019s just Elon being Elon,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg.\n\nBut Altman believes that he and Musk still share a \u201cconviction\u201d that artificial intelligence is important but needs to be handled carefully.\n\nDespite Musk\u2019s close proximity to Trump \u2013 having been named co-chair of the advisory board the Department of Government Efficiency \u2013 Altman does not think Musk would go so far as to use his power to quash a competitor.\n\n\u201cMay turn out to be proven wrong,\u201d Altman added."

            "article_content": "Sudan has been engulfed in a severe humanitarian and political crisis since the civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted on April 15, 2023. The political vacuum created after the fall of Omar al-Bashir\u2019s regime in 2019, combined with a power struggle and deepening mistrust, has pushed the country into a full-scale civil war. The conflict has not only brought catastrophic consequences for the Sudanese people but has also become more complex due to the involvement of regional and global actors.\n\nIn this context, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s mediation initiative to end the conflict and ensure regional stability has the potential to contribute significantly to resolving the crisis in Sudan while enhancing T\u00fcrkiye's diplomatic presence in Africa. However, it is essential to understand the origins and progression of Sudan's civil war to evaluate the opportunities and challenges of this initiative effectively.\n\nRoots of the Sudan civil war\n\nThe roots of Sudan's civil war can be traced back to the political vacuum that emerged after al-Bashir\u2019s regime was overthrown in April 2019. The power struggle between the two main factions of the transitional government, the SAF and the RSF, has been at the heart of the conflict. Disputes over the integration of the RSF into the national army ignited tensions. The aim of RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, to operate as an independent force clashed with SAF leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan\u2019s opposition to such autonomy. The conflict escalated into open warfare on April 15, 2023, when the RSF launched attacks on military installations in Khartoum, quickly spreading across the country.\n\nThe war has brought Sudan to the brink of a humanitarian and economic collapse. Khartoum has become the epicenter of the conflict, with its infrastructure severely damaged. Interruptions in electricity, water and health care services have displaced millions. According to the United Nations, over 8 million people have been internally displaced, while more than 3 million have fled to neighboring countries. The conflict\u2019s expansion into West Darfur has raised allegations of ethnic cleansing, with the RSF and allied militias accused of targeting the Fur population. Attacks by Baggara Arab militias have drawn significant international condemnation.\n\nCease-fire efforts and failures\n\nThe conflict in Sudan has been further complicated by the competing interests of regional and global actors. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) support for the RSF has led the SAF to view the UAE as a party to the conflict. Meanwhile, Russia's ties with the RSF reflect its ambitions to access Sudan's natural resources and establish a military base on the Red Sea coast. Neighboring countries like Chad, South Sudan and the Central African Republic face mounting challenges from refugee flows and border security issues. The United States and the European Union have highlighted human rights violations in West Darfur, calling for stronger sanctions against the conflict parties.\n\nDespite numerous efforts, cease-fire initiatives have repeatedly failed. Temporary truces brokered by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in May 2023 were quickly violated. The African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) have sought to present a comprehensive peace framework. Still, a lack of trust between the warring parties has rendered these efforts unsuccessful. The inability of either side to gain a decisive advantage has prolonged the conflict.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye\u2019s mediation initiative\n\nT\u00fcrkiye has intensified its efforts to mediate the Sudanese civil war and restore regional stability. On Jan. 4, 2025, Deputy Foreign Minister Burhanettin Duran\u2019s official visit to Port Sudan marked a concrete step in this direction. T\u00fcrkiye has adopted a proactive role by leveraging humanitarian diplomacy, economic cooperation and confidence-building measures to address the conflict.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye possesses three critical advantages in mediating the Sudan crisis. First, its historical ties with Sudan and its humanitarian aid initiatives have fostered a positive perception among the Sudanese public. Second, T\u00fcrkiye's recent normalization of relations with the UAE provides a potential dialogue channel between SAF and RSF. Third, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s capacity to collaborate with regional organizations like the African Union and IGAD enhances the legitimacy of its mediation efforts.\n\nHowever, T\u00fcrkiye faces several challenges in this process. The UAE\u2019s overt support for the RSF may lead the SAF to question T\u00fcrkiye's neutrality. Furthermore, the deep mistrust within Sudan and the competing interests of global actors (the U.S., Russia, China and Iran) limit T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s maneuvering space. Therefore, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s ability to propose practical measures, such as confidence-building steps between the SAF and the UAE, temporary cease-fires and resource-sharing agreements, will be crucial for progress.\n\nThe civil war that began in Sudan on April 15, 2023, has evolved into a crisis that affects not only Sudanese society but also the broader region. The humanitarian disasters and international power struggles stemming from the war make its resolution even more challenging.\n\nIn this context, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s mediation initiative offers a critical opportunity to achieve regional stability and enhance its diplomatic influence in Africa. The success of this initiative hinges on T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s commitment to impartiality, the development of trust-building measures between the warring parties and effective collaboration with regional and international actors. By carefully implementing a multidimensional strategy, T\u00fcrkiye could play a lasting role in resolving the Sudanese crisis and establish a model for addressing similar conflicts in the region. Every step in this process must be meticulously planned and executed to sustain the Sudanese people's hope for peace."

(Photo: Eva-Maria Krafczyk / picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nSudan\u2019s civil war continues to rage, with no sign that either the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) or Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are close to a military victory or open to a ceasefire.\n\nAccording to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 10 million civilians are displaced within Sudan or into neighbouring countries. The country\u2019s economy is in ruins, its business centres transformed into battlefields. Severe hunger afflicts half the population, with famine emerging in Darfur.\n\nadvertisement Don't want to see this? Remove ads\n\nThe war has also had a catalytic effect on regional illicit markets, as civilians and combatants turn to smuggling networks for key goods. Illegal businesses have boomed, especially in the historically marginalised borderlands between Chad, Libya and Sudan.\n\nSudan and neighbouring countries\n\nAlthough many smuggled goods feed the conflict economy, food, fuel and arms stand out as especially important in and around Sudan\u2019s northern and western borders.\n\nFood smuggling into Sudan predates the war, but the conflict has supercharged it. Recent Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime research recorded a marked increase in the clandestine movement of food over the past eight months, as hunger has worsened.\n\nInterviewees said food smuggling in Sudan\u2019s borderlands was highly decentralised, with many relatively small smugglers plying the routes between southern Libya, northern Chad, and northwestern Sudan.\n\nLike food, fuel smuggling on Sudan\u2019s borders is not new. A high-volume trade in contraband petrol and diesel from eastern Libya to Sudan emerged the year before the war, reportedly controlled by the Libyan Arab Armed Forces (LAAF) and the RSF. The disruption of legal fuel supplies in Sudan since the civil war started has expanded trade values and volumes.\n\nThe main route remains through eastern Libya. On it, a few LAAF-linked actors smuggle fuel from coastal depots to the southern city of Kufra and across into SAF-controlled areas in Sudan. One research contact estimated that 500,000 barrels of petrol and diesel were smuggled weekly via this route.\n\nOver the past year, another smuggling route has emerged between LAAF-controlled southwestern Libya, northern Chad, and Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region. While initially ad hoc and driven by low-level smugglers, it has reportedly become more tightly organised, controlled by LAAF and RSF officials.\n\nWeapons trafficking has also been boosted by the war. Most international reporting focuses on gun running to Sudan by nations supporting either the RSF or the SAF. This fuels the conflict, but is just one part of the picture.\n\nThe civil war is reinvigorating and partially reshaping the human smuggling ecosystem in Sudan and neighbouring states.\n\nA more decentralised arms trade has emerged, primarily concentrated around the Chad-Sudan border. It mostly draws on weapons and ammunition already in Libya or other regional conflict zones. However, in the tri-border region, a recent seizure of four trailers of weapons imported through Benghazi\u2019s port headed for Chad shows that international trafficking pathways could be emerging.\n\nadvertisement Don't want to see this? Remove ads\n\nThe weapons trade across the Chad-Sudan border is bidirectional, with Sudanese traffickers exporting arms stolen from or abandoned by SAF personnel in Darfur to networks in eastern Chad, which move them to other regional markets. This reveals the evolution of important countercyclical markets in goods \u2013 primarily weapons, stolen vehicles, plundered consumer goods and hashish \u2013 smuggled out of Sudan.\n\nThe conflict has also driven a rise in human smuggling along Sudan\u2019s borders. This is dominated by refugees whose avenues for legal and safe movement out of the country have shrunk over the past 20 months. Smuggling networks have expanded existing operations or developed new routes along the Egyptian, Libyan and Chadian borders. The civil war is reinvigorating and partially reshaping the human smuggling ecosystem in Sudan and neighbouring states.\n\nCrucially, these markets aren\u2019t static and will probably continue evolving and expanding as the war continues. Experience from other regional conflicts, notably Libya, shows that shifts in illicit markets and war economies can have an impact long after the guns have stopped firing.\n\nInternational actors working to end Sudan\u2019s war need to understand and monitor the conflict\u2019s intersection with these markets.\n\nadvertisement Don't want to see this? Remove ads\n\nThe trafficked arms flowing into Sudan now could well reverse in the future, fuelling regional instability and violence.\n\nFirst, combatants increasingly rely on weapons and fuel trafficked in from abroad, and smuggled food is critical for starving civilians. Understanding how these flows are evolving can provide early warning about emerging risks and help stakeholders tailor their responses.\n\nSecond, the conflict has led to a growing intersection of illicit and state actors. Interviewees said smuggling often occurred with the knowledge and protection of RSF- and SAF-affiliated actors in Sudan and officials in neighbouring states.\n\nOfficials financially vested in the conflict economy could be disinclined to make peace. Even if peace comes, such connections could subvert the rule of law, eroding public institutions\u2019 capacities and worsening citizens\u2019 trust in the state.\n\nThird, this could impact the evolution of illicit economies in Sudan. Even a quick end to the war would leave the country with a wrecked economy and overwhelmed law enforcement. Countering illicit economies probably wouldn\u2019t be prioritised.\n\nLast are the regional consequences. Strong illicit markets and criminal networks could escalate corruption and weaken government capabilities in neighbouring countries. The trafficked arms flowing into Sudan now could well reverse in the future, fuelling regional instability and violence.\n\nadvertisement Don't want to see this? Remove ads\n\nMost international focus on Sudan is likely to be geared towards negotiating a ceasefire and building peace. However, given the risks, the conflict economy and its tie-ins with regional markets need more attention. Three interlinked policy areas stand out.\n\nFirst, tracking and analysing the conflict economy, with an eye on how it could fuel instability or corruption in Sudan or neighbouring states. Second, countering the worst harms of the war economy, such as human smuggling and weapons trafficking. This could also mitigate the risk that crackdowns on smuggling food and fuel unintentionally worsen vulnerable populations\u2019 situations.\n\nTargeted financial and travel sanctions on key members of the criminal ecosystems fuelling Sudan\u2019s war economy could help deter the involvement of political and business elites.\n\nA number of measures could be used in tandem with prosecutorial approaches, law enforcement capacity building, and diplomatic pressure on regional states and non-state actors facilitating illicit flows. Development aid to communities harmed by the war and war economy is also vital.

They litter the Old Testament and the New; once you start seeing them, you can\u2019t stop.\n\nA modern example of a short chiasm would be If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Jesus makes a pithy chiastic statement in Mark 2:27: \u201cThe Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.\u201d\n\nSign up for The Daily Briefing Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nBut most chiastic structures are longer than one line, sometimes stretching across entire chapters, with a hinge point in the middle. Westerners are accustomed to a conclusion landing at the end, like the moral of the story or the punchline of a joke, but the ancient Near Eastern mind liked to embed the main idea dead center.\n\nIf we don\u2019t recognize this structure as we read Scripture, from the Psalms to the words of Jesus, we risk placing the emphasis on the wrong point. As a Bible teacher, I see how chiasms honor the truism that repetition is the mother of learning. Chiasms are memory aids, God\u2019s kindness to past generations of worshipers who likely never held Scripture in their hands as well as to modern Christians in our distracted age. They are meant to help us remember.\n\nModern readers may wonder why this particular form of parallelism appealed so heavily to the ancient Near Eastern mind. I certainly did\u2014that is, until my mother died.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you have to take me to this appointment.\u201d I looked over at my diminutive 79-year-old mother, perched in the passenger seat, eyes apologetic, fretting with her purse.\n\nLike many in her generation, my mom found it difficult to accept even help that was easy to supply. \u201cYou are a person to love, not a problem to solve\u201d had become my mantra to her each time she expressed dismay at having interrupted my life in any way.\n\nBefore you begin to assume that my mother and I had an enviable relationship, let me say we did not\u2014but through much hard work, we found a real sweetness together in her final years. In December of 2021, her kids and grandkids moved her into an apartment five minutes from my home. We set up her antique furniture, hung her favorite pictures, and put out her favorite vase, the one with wisteria around the rim. I was excited to be able to drop in or run errands for her so easily.\n\nI planned a family dinner for her 80th birthday that January. Three days before it, she texted that she had a stomach bug and wasn\u2019t sure she would make it. She assured me she was fine. Please don\u2019t come over. But she was sicker than she thought.\n\nHer birthday passed in the ICU, and a week later she was placed on palliative care, coming home to my house for hospice. No more beeping monitors and sterile overhead lights. No more masks and visitor restrictions. Instead, a room flooded with sunshine, warm with color, and filled with loved ones.\n\nShe was, at this point, no longer communicative. But I knew if she could have spoken, she would have repeated the words she had strained to say again and again during her brief hospital stay: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to be a burden.\u201d\n\nMy brothers and I took our place at her bedside to keep a vigil familiar to many reading this. We listened as her breathing became more and more labored with each passing day. We witnessed the hard work of dying.\n\nOn the second day, the hospice nurse told me, \u201cYou know, you can coach her. Give her encouragement. Tell her she\u2019s doing well.\u201d I played her favorite hymns. I held her hand. I helped keep her clean and comfortable. I whispered a thousand times, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home. You\u2019re a person to love, not a problem to solve.\u201d\n\nAt last, she reached the end of her travail. A final deep exhale, a crashing silence.\n\nAnd it hit me: the marvelous and terrible symmetry of a long human life.\n\nEighty years earlier, hadn\u2019t she entered this world in a similar way\u2014through a great labor, with a deep inhale and a piercing wail? Had she not received much the same care in the hours after her birth that we provided in the hours before her death?\n\nI suspect the reason the ancients loved a chiasm was because it is the recognizable shape of the sweep of life. Perhaps God, in his kindness, designed it to be such. Bookends. Repetition. Symmetry.\n\nI reasoned that the other concentric layers of a human life could be mapped as well. Every human life is unique, but what might be the general pattern? I sketched out my thoughts.\n\nThe chiasm of a human life. The idea is not unique to me. I recall the saying that we are first children to our parents, then parents to our children, then parents to our parents, and finally children to our children.\n\nIf life is a chiasm, and if chiasms teach, what does the chiasm of life seek to teach us? If we become students of it, I believe it can \u201cteach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom\u201d (Ps. 90:12).\n\nRemembering that seasons of life follow a patterned order helps us inhabit the season we are in and prioritize how to use the time we are given. Since death announced its presence in Genesis 3, our days have been numbered. Perhaps God, in his infinite kindness, gave us a chiasm, a patterned measuring rod, to number those days rightly.\n\nKnowing that aging means the relinquishing of freedoms and abilities helps us embrace that process rather than hold onto self-reliance. It helps us to anticipate the next season, to savor the one we are in, and to be grateful for the ones we have already left behind.\n\nRecognizing that in some seasons we give care and in some we receive care helps us accept care when it\u2019s our turn to receive. We are not problems to solve in our extreme age any more than we were in our infancy. We are simply people to love, in a stage when others repay a debt of care they themselves received in their time.\n\nThe chiastic structure of life explains why we feel such shock when a life is cut short. We expect intuitively that human life should make a full arc. The asymmetry of a young or untimely death creates dissonance. No bookend. No parallel. No full circle. My mother\u2019s death was a good one by many measures, not least because of its blessed symmetry.\n\nBut if a chiasm puts the main point at the middle, how are our middle years noteworthy? Midlife offers a unique opportunity, a moment of perspective at the crossroads. If we have paid close attention to how we entered the chiasm, we will be better able to exit it with grace and submission. Looking back over the first half of life can help us anticipate the second half\u2014in both its losses and its gains.\n\nIf we focus just on our abilities and responsibilities, we see only gains in the first half of the chiasm of life and only parallel losses in the second. In a culture that values youth and vigor, we risk losing sight of what we learn over the years: wisdom. The wisdom of aging means that even as our bodies increasingly fail us, our internal lives grow richer and steadier. Bodies decline, but people develop.\n\nAt 55, I can already track the decline in my physical abilities. I am still in a stage where I am the supplier of help to others, but if the Lord grants me length of years, I will one day be only a recipient\u2014fed and clothed and cared for by someone else\u2019s hands and feet.\n\nThe days in which my body can yield help to others are numbered, and I want to number them rightly. My parents have helped me with the math. Watching them pass into old age has brought into focus for me the preciousness of the years I have left. My earliest caregivers have moved to receiving care. Their physical abilities grow more limited, but their insights are deepening.\n\nThey are the evidence to me that, while failing joints and heart valves and eyesight and hearing may increasingly unsteady our bodies, wisdom increasingly steadies our souls. Bodies decline, people develop. The lamp of wisdom burns brighter as the oil of life experience grows in supply.\n\nFor the believer, old age is an invitation toward burgeoning luminosity.\n\nIn my attic is a relic of days gone by: a cassette player my husband owned as a teen. In the living room is another relic\u2014the vase with wisteria trim. My mother\u2019s, passed on to me. It\u2019s not of enormous value, but unlike its electronic upstairs neighbor, its value is steadily growing with age.\n\nHere is where we bump into the problem with the way our culture views not just aging but also the elderly. My husband, Jeff, and I are affectionately called \u201cthe Olds\u201d by our kids, who thankfully still seek our advice and who regard us as a source of wisdom obtained through length of years. But our children are increasingly the exception.\n\nSo many cultural shifts have happened in so little time that many parents and children are estranged by their differing views. Whereas one\u2019s elders used to be seen as those increasing in wisdom with every passing year, they are now likely to be seen as increasingly obsolete (\u201cOkay, boomer\u201d). Less like a vase, more like a cassette player.\n\nWhen I listen to my 84-year-old father\u2019s advice, it occurs to me that he always waits patiently for me to end my question before responding. At 55, I often sit with a younger person to hear about their difficulty in marriage, parenting, or ministry; recognize a familiar pattern a few minutes into the telling; and, at the right moment, offer the same advice I have given on similar occasions.\n\nWe have a way of hitting the same roadblocks. If I have acquired a modest level of wisdom in middle age, how much more does my father hold at 84? There is godly wisdom, a gift God grants, but there is also the wisdom of age\u2014gained by sheer length of years and attention to those around us.\n\nThe wisdom of age is the basis for the fifth commandment\u2019s requirement to honor father and mother, a command given not to children, as we often assume, but to adults. (Note that the commands following it deal with the very adult sins of murder, adultery, theft, bearing false witness, and covetousness.)\n\nThe fifth commandment is intended to instruct adult children to show honor to elderly parents. The Puritans interpret correctly its greater implications in the Westminster Catechism, noting that it included showing honor to all who are our superiors in age and experience.\n\nPut succinctly: Honor the Olds. They know some things you don\u2019t. Their bodies are declining, but their personhood is ever developing. We can miss this so easily. I once heard a woman in her 30s gently reminding an audience of younger women that \u201colder Christian women are still valuable in the church.\u201d In accordance with the fifth commandment, I would offer a slightly altered wording. Those older than us are not still valuable. They are, rather, increasingly valuable.\n\nIn a culture that fetishizes youth and views aging as a journey into irrelevance and uselessness, God\u2019s family takes the view that people possess an ever-developing value, one that renders their contributions essential and indispensable.\n\nOur elders have much to offer us\u2014until they reach the stage in the chiasm of life when they don\u2019t. At some point, old age will take from them even the ability to think or communicate. And yet, they will still teach us. Aging requires a fortitude like nothing else. Caring for the aged grants unforeseen blessings to the younger generation. Those who hold the hand of the dying learn secrets to make them wise. They learn that the elderly are not an obligation but a sacred trust. My mother was luminous in her dying.\n\nThe grand symmetry of the human life can yield wisdom if we give it our attention. We move from the helplessness of birth to seasons of growth and possibility under the watchful care of our parents. We become caregivers to our children, then to our parents. We watch growth and possibility turn to decline and limited ability in our own lives. We return to helplessness. And we leave this life much as we entered. How kind of the Lord to give us a roadmap for aging until our last enemy, death, is defeated.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the lie that the first half of life is to be clung to. When we behold the arc from beginning to end, we learn to value all of it. We learn not just to number our days but to cherish them\u2014the days of our youth, the days of our twilight, and all the days in between.\n\nDon\u2019t let a youth-obsessed culture rob you of your sense of the value of all parts of life. We need our aging faces and slowing bodies to tell us the truth: that time is passing, and that it is exceedingly precious. Each season yields its own exquisite fruit. No need to cling to what was never meant to last. God is faithful in every season.\n\nJen Wilkin is an author, Bible teacher, and cohost of the Knowing Faith podcast."

            "article_content": "On the night of August 10, 2022, five pilots on two separate commercial airline flights were wholly convinced they\u2019d documented proof of an Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP) over the Pacific Ocean. Pilots from both flights reported seeing odd lights zipping through the sky\u2014but the single incident they all witnessed turned out to be Starlink telecommunications satellites.\n\nIn recent years, pilots\u2014as well as the public\u2014have mistakenly identified these low-Earth orbit satellites as UAPs. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of 69 reports just from January 23\u2013April 27, 2023 that identify \u201cUFO-UAP,\u201d and according to one paper , more than a third of them could be Starlink satellites. Unfortunately, such mysterious sightings lead to pilot confusion and potential safety consequences because of the distraction and extra chatter about them over the airwaves.\n\nThe core issue with pilots misidentifying satellites as UAPs stems from the fact that pilots cannot access real-time data about satellite movements, leaving them unprepared to recognize strange lights in the sky. These satellites may appear to move in unexpected ways, based on their orientation, and they may also appear and disappear, since their solar arrays reflect sunlight at different angles when deployed, relative to the pilot\u2019s position in flight.\n\nStarlink satellites orbit about 342 miles above Earth, according to Starlink\u2019s website, and that places them lower than most other satellites, making them visible to our eyes as spots of light, no magnification needed. More than 6,000 Starlink satellites are currently circling Earth, and the SpaceX-owned company aims to eventually have 42,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit, which means pilots will need to have surefire methods for identifying them.\n\n\n\nGetty Images The passage of Starlink satellites is seen in the sky over southern Poland on November 1, 2024.\n\nFour scientists want to fill the information gap in this type of situation to prevent unnecessary aviation risk. Led by mechanical engineer Douglas J. Buettner of the University of Utah, the team devised a method to simulate the exact locations of satellites, and they proposed plans that would provide pilots with the information they need to quickly identify satellites. Their paper describing this work was accepted at the 2024 International Academy of Astronautics Conference on Space Situational Awareness (ICSSA).\n\nTo shed some light on what the five pilots saw, the scientists conducted an \u201castrometric analysis\u201d of their reports, using two cell phone photos and a video the pilots had taken of \u201can unrecognized and possibly anomalous phenomenon,\u201d according to the paper. To corroborate the data, researchers looked up Starlink\u2019s records, noting that the visual line the satellites created in the sky\u2014called a \u201ctrain\u201d of satellites\u2014launched that same day. The team also used data from the flight, including photographs taken in the cockpit. Using these pieces of information and an orbital mechanics software tool, they were able to reconstruct the August 10 cockpit view. It showed Starlink satellites matching both the time and place of the sighting.\n\nTheir analysis used a technique called \u201cray-traced rendering\u201d of the view from the pilots\u2019 cockpit, which provided a more visual simulation of exactly where the pilots saw the satellites through their cockpit windows, according to the paper. The simulation experiments indicated that the satellites\u2019 solar arrays must have been deployed, likely making them glint brightly enough for the pilots in both aircraft to notice them. \u201cIn the implementation of our approach, we were able to closely match the apparent speed in degrees per second traveled by the object between the two photographs taken by one of the pilots,\u201d the scientists wrote.\n\nThe team hopes that their work demonstrates a plan that could plausibly \u201cwarn aviators and the public about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations,\u201d and therefore support aviation safety, they wrote. In the future, it\u2019s worth studying how the deployment of a satellite\u2014as well as its surface materials\u2014affects the way it reflects sunlight, the paper adds. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said on X that the satellite orientation could be adjusted to minimize solar reflection during astronomical experiments, though the team\u2019s paper does not specifically address this possibility.\n\nThe authors do suggest various procedures and technologies that aircraft could deploy to support accurate UAP identification. For example, pilots should be allowed to \u201croutinely provide photographic evidence from either an automated system when they are busy with safety critical aircraft operations, or using cell phones when they are not allowed,\u201d to greatly improve UAP analysis.\n\nSatellite operators should also provide information about satellite movements\u2014such as orientation, orbit location, and deployment timelines\u2014to support more accurate and detailed models, the scientists write. Finally, they suggest a way for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reduce in-flight risks due to pilots trying to determine the source of a UAP. Air traffic controllers could have access to a satellite-modeling system that would enable them to anticipate satellite sightings and alert the pilots when necessary. \u201cWe envision this as a collaborative effort between the satellite\u2019s owners (in this case SpaceX/Starlink), the FAA, NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Space Force,\u201d the authors note.\n\nAs for people on the ground, anyone can find Starlink in the sky. Look up on a clear, dark night, and if you see a white light or \u201ctrain\u201d of lights moving across the sky, go to FindStarlink.com. You can search for your time and location and determine if what you see is indeed Starlink satellites."

One such revolutionary moment is being celebrated in 2025, which the United Nations has declared to be the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. This marks the centenary of the advent of quantum mechanics, which began in a flurry of papers 100 years ago. Just as it would be impossible to make sense of modern biology without Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, our fundamental understanding of the physical world is now rooted in quantum principles. Modern physics is quantum physics.\n\nThe word quantum refers to the way matter absorbs or releases energy \u2014 in discrete packets, or quanta. Its use in physics comes from the German word quant, which is derived from a Latin term meaning \u2018how much\u2019. In around 1900, physicists such as Max Planck and Albert Einstein began to describe, in an ad hoc way, why several phenomena of the subatomic realm could not be explained using the classical mechanics developed by Isaac Newton and others some two centuries earlier. Then, in 1925, quantum came to be used to describe the fundamentals of an entirely new form of mechanics \u2014 the branch of physics that describes the relationship between forces and the motion of physical objects.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nAs science historian Kristian Camilleri describes in an Essay on the startling developments of that year and those that followed, the physicist Werner Heisenberg travelled to the German island of Heligoland in the North Sea in the summer of 1925 in search of relief from severe hay fever. Shortly after this, he submitted to the journal Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik a paper whose title translates as \u2018On quantum-theoretical reinterpretation of kinematic and mechanical relationships\u2019 (W. Heisenberg Z. Physik 33, 879\u2013893; 1925). This prompted further studies in the following months by Heisenberg and his close collaborators, as well as work using an alternative approach by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.\n\nThe revolution did not begin with physicists throwing away the laws of classical mechanics, but with their radically reinterpreting classical concepts such as energy and momentum. However, it did require its initiators to abandon dearly held common-sense ideas \u2014 for example, the expectation that subatomic objects such as particles have a well-defined position and momentum at any given time. Instead, the physicists found that natural phenomena had an inherently unknowable nature. Classical physics, in other words, is only an approximate representation of reality, and manifests itself only at the macroscopic level. A century on, this insight into the nature of the physical world still thrills and bamboozles in equal measures. Many Nature readers will know about the philosophical quandaries raised by quantum cats that are simultaneously dead and alive, and about the industry that is growing around quantum computing.\n\nOthers will know how quantum ideas gave rise to the lasers that beam information through the cables of the Internet, and the transistors that provide the processing power of electronic chips. But quantum ideas also shape our understanding of nature, at all levels, explaining why solid objects don\u2019t fall apart and how stars shine and, ultimately, die.\n\nA quantum year\n\nCommemorative events are being planned all over the world for the coming 12 months. They include an opening ceremony for the UN year at the headquarters of the UN scientific organization UNESCO in Paris in February; special events at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Anaheim, California, in March; and a workshop for physicists on Heligoland in June. The organizers\u2019 collective ambition is to celebrate not just the centenary of quantum mechanics, but also the science and applications that arose from it in the past century \u2014 and to explore how quantum physics might bring further change in the century to come.\n\nThis billion-dollar firm plans to build giant quantum computers from light. Can it succeed?\n\nIn May, Ghana, the country that originally proposed that the UN proclaim 2025 the year of quantum science, is hosting an international conference on the topic in Kumasi. And in August, science historians will meet to celebrate the quantum century in Salvador de Bahia in Brazil.\n\nThis meeting will be the high point of a 20-year research programme that set out to re-examine the development of quantum theory. One major aim of that work, says historian Michel Janssen at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, was to establish the contributions of a collective of scientists, many of whom \u2014 particularly women \u2014 have not been recognized in the history of the field.\n\nThese \u201chidden figures\u201d include Lucy Mensing, who was a member of the same group as Heisenberg and worked out some of the first applications of his quantum-mechanical theory, says Daniela Monaldi, a historian at York University in Toronto, Canada. One of the most notable events of the year will be the publication of a biographical volume of essays on 16 of them, Women in the History of Quantum Physics.\n\nGerman physicists Otto Stern (pictured) and Walther Gerlach demonstrated quantum spin in the famous Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment of 1922.Credit: AIP Emilio Segr\u00e8 Visual Archives, Segr\u00e8 Collection\n\nFor all that it has already brought, the quantum revolution still has unfinished business. In the years in which researchers were laying the foundations of quantum mechanics, they also began to rebuild other branches of physics \u2014 such as the study of electromagnetism, and states of matter \u2014 from quantum foundations. They also looked to extend their theories to encompass objects that move at close to light speed, something that the original quantum theory did not. These efforts drastically expanded the scope of quantum science and led researchers to develop the standard model of particles and fields, a process that finally came together in the 1970s.\n\n\u2018A truly remarkable breakthrough\u2019: Google\u2019s new quantum chip achieves accuracy milestone\n\nThe standard model has been incredibly successful, culminating in the 2012 discovery of its linchpin elementary particle, the Higgs boson. But these extensions lie on less-solid theoretical ground than quantum mechanics does \u2014 and leave several phenomena unexplained, such as the nature of the \u2018dark matter\u2019 that seems to greatly outweigh conventional, visible matter in the wider cosmos. Moreover, one important phenomenon, gravity, still resists being quantized.\n\nOther conceptual problems of quantum physics remain open. In particular, researchers struggle to understand what exactly happens when experiments \u2018collapse\u2019 the fuzzy probabilities of quantum objects into one precise measurement, a key step in creating the \u2014 still remorselessly classical \u2014 macroscopic world we live in. Over the past few decades, researchers have been developing ways to turn these quirks of quantum reality into useful technologies. The resulting applications in computing, ultra-secure communications and innovative scientific instruments are still in their nascent stages.\n\nQuantum theory keeps on giving. This year is an opportunity to celebrate and to make the broader public aware of the role that quantum physics has in their lives \u2014 and to inspire future generations, whoever they are and wherever they are in the world, to contribute to another quantum century."
