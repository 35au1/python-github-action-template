            "article_content": "The author's father, circa 1981. Courtesy of Lyndall Riedel\n\nThere\u2019s one video available on the internet concerning my father, Patrick McGuire. It\u2019s strange. Uploaded to YouTube 15 years ago \u2014 though clearly recorded much earlier \u2014 the video frames another TV screen. There is constant static, and the image is fractured as if the broadcast comes from far away. My father is discussing cattle mutilations under hypnosis.\n\n\u201cWe come up on a cow that was dead. They cut the nose off, tongues out and the sex organs were gone,\u201d he recounts as though he is sleepwalking through a nightmare. He goes on to describe in great detail a \u201cspaceship\u201d that landed on his ranch and took members of his herd \u2015 their distant, terrified animal cries filling those dark prairie nights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne comment below the video reads, \u201cHaving lived and worked with cow-men, can you immagine this guy going to town after this got out publicly. I mean they are a finicky bunch to say the least.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t have to imagine. I grew up with him walking through our small Western town, his life by then fractured like that broadcast. He was completely destitute, picking through my classmates\u2019 garbage, and when a classmate came to school the next day and told me what they saw, their grin, and subsequent laughter, left little to the imagination. However, I then joined in with their laughter. That commenter was right: We are a finicky bunch, to say the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn May 14, 2009, my father passed away in a Colorado hospital due to cancer. He was 67. I did not speak to him before he died. His last years were spent in homelessness, though he hadn\u2019t always lived that way. His last words, so I heard, were about grand conspiracies and sinister deep states, though he hadn\u2019t always spoken about such topics. My father\u2019s legacy in our small Wyoming town \u2015 and inside our family \u2015 is stained with his tales of alien abduction, interstellar prophecy and the insistence he was chosen, though he had not always been chosen. There was a time before my birth when he was obsessed with the lore of his rural community, the spiraling complexities of high school dances and the schemes of enlarging his Roman Catholic family. He was normal, caring and complete. That was before the stars came knocking.\n\nWhen I first saw the bold headline \u201cIntelligence Officials Say U.S. Has Retrieved Craft of Non-Human Origin,\u201d published June 5, 2023, in The Debrief, I initially didn\u2019t think about whether the headline was true. I didn\u2019t contemplate what the recovered crafts might look like or that \u201cnon-human\u201d was just another euphemism for the same thing we have been talking about since 1947 \u2015 I thought about my father.\n\nI can see him now as though he were alive today, black cowboy hat tilted, face tanned and cracked from the high plains sun, saying, \u201cWho\u2019s laughing now?\u201d I\u2019m not laughing anymore, but not because I know what that headline is saying is absolutely true and proof lies just around the corner; I\u2019m not laughing because I should never have laughed in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ranch that once belonged to Patrick McGuire. The author's father claimed this was where he was visited by aliens. Courtesy of David Riedel\n\nIn 2017, The New York Times broke news about a previously unknown Pentagon department: the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). This department was involved in investigating what were formerly called UFOs, now referred to as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). More shifting euphemisms and acronyms for us to track. Since then, the news surrounding these phenomena has steadily grown. There was a congressional hearing in 2022, the creation of a governmental department called the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and a NASA hearing devoted to encountered \u2015 or not encountered \u2015 UAPs. And now a new whistleblower, former intelligence official and AATIP task force member David Grusch, claims a government cover-up. \u201cThese [programs] are retrieving non-human origin technical vehicles, call it spacecraft if you will, non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed,\u201d he stated to NewsNation recently. What once seemed to be the premise for the next \u201dX-Files\u201d reboot has become front page news, gaining mainstream consideration by the serious, the rational, the institutional and the scientific.\n\nIt\u2019s strange to be here in this cultural moment. I think many people feel that to some degree. Whether this is all true or not, it is unmooring to read that U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is demanding disclosure on a subject that, only a decade ago, would have been political suicide to even mention. To read former Pentagon official Lue Elizondo state, \u201cMy personal belief is that there is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone\u201d is surreal, and stranger still is reading about governmental UFO agencies and \u201cBlack Money\u201d in The New York Times.\n\nD.W. Pasulka, author of the 2019 book \u201dAmerican Cosmic,\u201d an exploration of our cultural interaction with the UFO phenomena, recently referred to this specific whistleblower event and to the preceding media coverage as a \u201cparadigm shift,\u201d a fundamental change in the way we conceptualize an issue. \u201cThat is,\u201d she explained, \u201cthere is huge pressure from [the] fringe, then marginal sources that finally initiate a shift in consensus.\u201d And there is an unexpected change in our current moment from the one that preceded it, though now it feels to me \u2014 perhaps, given my family history, more than most \u2014 like there has also been an unexpected change in the past.\n\nThe stigma against people who believe in UFOs may go back to the very birth of the topic itself, when the first reports of UFOs described by Kenneth Arnold went from \u201csaucer,\u201d \u201cdisk\u201d and \u201cpie pan\u201d to sensational terms like \u201cflying saucers\u201d in the press, for which Arnold later stated, \u201cI have, of course, suffered some embarrassment here and there by misquotes and misinformation.\u201d From there, this subject expanded to include tropes like anal probes, stock characters in films living their lonely, manic lives in houses criss-crossed with spiderwebs of yarn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbductees have been satirized on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and in popular beer commercials. Even famed Harvard psychologist Richard J. McNally stated in his past clinical research into the abduction phenomenon that \u201cit occasionally took [a researcher] several tries to record these [abduction] narratives properly. He would sometimes burst out laughing while trying to record these stories with the necessary solemnity.\u201d Insincerity and mockery has shrouded the subject so thoroughly that NASA recently shared at a hearing that \u201cthe stigma associated with reporting UFO sightings \u2014 as well as the harassment of people who work to investigate them \u2014 may be hindering efforts to determine their origins.\u201d\n\nI know that stigma well \u2015 having experienced it from both sides. My father was born and raised in Wyoming and was a rancher like his father and his grandfather. He nestled into a Western community that branded their cattle and youth alike with abstract symbols, that found definition in the regularity of rain and saw acreage as an inappropriate subject to discuss openly. \u201cAsking about the size of a man\u2019s spread is like asking to look at his checkbook,\u201d he said to me once, laughing. And one local recently told me, \u201cHe could break a horse like nobody\u2019s business. He was real sharp like that. Shame what happened to him.\u201d\n\nMy father saw UFOs. Not one, once, like a dinner guest might claim after a few glasses of wine, but many times. Numerous UFOs all at once, up close, lingering in the western Wyoming sky like a nightmare that refused to dissipate come sunrise. In 1981, on NBC\u2019s prime-time TV show \u201cThat\u2019s Incredible,\u201d my father\u2019s story gained national attention as he related, under hypnosis, the specifics of his abduction claims and the demands aliens had made upon his life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA yearbook photo of the author's father as featured in his funeral pamphlet. Courtesy of David Riedel\n\nOn the March 5, 1980, airing of ABC\u2019s \u201dEyewitness News,\u201d he reported that UFOs had landed on his ranch \u201csomewhere around 25, 30 times,\u201d and witnesses present were quoted as saying they saw \u201ctwo or three of them land at separate times\u2026 [and] we stayed and watched the sun come up and we saw two of them, in daylight, hovering in two separate places.\u201d A headline in the March 24, 1981, National Enquirer reads, \u201cFarmer: Aliens Use My Ranch as Their Landing Place,\u201d and it reports that \u201cLocal newspaper and television reporters have also seen strange lights darting over the McGuire ranch.\u201d\n\nThere appeared to be no shortage of witnesses to what was happening on his land. \u201cWhile we cannot be certain of what we saw,\u201d Casper Star Tribune investigative reporter Greg Bean wrote on June 29, 1980, \u201cnone of us left the McGuire farm with as much skepticism as we arrived with. Perhaps we can return.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father\u2019s claims continued. Under hypnosis with famous UFO psychologist R. Leo Sprinkle, he recounted abductions by \u201cStar People,\u201d who demanded his actions in conjunction with their plan for humanity. These Star People told him of a coming climate apocalypse. Following this hypnosis, in a mere handful of years, he was completely destitute without home or family, and he claimed that governmental forces were keeping him that way because of what he saw and said. This story is a regular in the UFO community. In fact, the story of Grusch, the whistleblower, is no surprise to the community, the folks who did believe and respect my father. Covert conspiracies, recovered craft, Nazi research and \u201cnon-human origins\u201d \u2015 almost everything the whistleblower related, my father related to me in similar fashion at some point in my life.\n\nFrom the earliest points in my childhood, I was told that UFOs were nothing to make light of. At every turn, every nightfall, through any locked door \u2014 the Star People could take anyone, even me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father\u2019s description of the Star People, and my subsequent nightmares, matched what our culture has come to expect: 5-foot hairless beings with eyes like colorless pools hovering by my bedside. Soon classmates and teachers alike were smirking at my fears, and then, like any sociological contagion, I began to smirk, too. Then TV took over for my teachers, and \u201cSouth Park, \u201cConeheads\u201d and \u201cMars Attacks\u201d taught me that this was, indeed, a laughing matter.\n\nMy brothers and I laughed when our father talked about the implants and their accompanying pain. We laughed when he claimed he could barely walk after what the Star People did to him. We laughed when he said that he was suing the government for the land they took from him, for destroying his life, for destroying our lives. We laughed. The world laughed.\n\nIf you were not one to laugh about UFOs, then you didn\u2019t say anything at all, and if you did, you hesitantly considered the person you were talking to first, making sure they would not laugh at you, too, before you said anything at all. For many, it was a precarious high-wire if one was to discuss the trauma of the phenomenon or its reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we weren\u2019t getting our meals in school, my father often took us to the local soup kitchen in a basement bunker in the town Episcopal cathedral. I remember best the dampness of the walls and the claustrophobia of dining elbow-to-elbow with the other folks weathering the financial storms outside. Breaking expired bread to share over lentil soup, we were often the only children in attendance. For most of the diners, this was the last place to go. The person across from me would make small talk between spoonfuls, but nothing of the weather or local gossip. In the soup kitchen, the talk was of remote viewing, reverse-engineering and tapping into the collective unconscious for cosmic spiritual growth. I would nod with feigned excitement and encourage them to continue, go deeper. \u201cWhat about the face of Mars?\u201d I would ask with a smile. My brothers and I often failed to contain our laughter.\n\nThe author's childhood home in Bosler, Wyoming. Courtesy of David Riedel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the world contemplates Grusch\u2019s claims, I\u2019m the one who feels ashamed. These potential findings mean only one thing to me: An accounting must be made. How should we address our past mockery and ridicule if it turns out that, hidden in a desert base somewhere, there are indeed crafts, cadavers and photographs of strange visitors?\n\nRegardless of the origins of the metallic orbs, Tic Tac crafts and flying saucers \u2014 and independent of the validity of Grusch\u2019s claims \u2014 we should feel impelled to investigate and rescue a community living with the trauma of the unknown and indescribable. A community we greeted with sneers and derision for so long, a community we pushed to the outskirts of our cultural limits to be safely ignored. If it is all true \u2015 or it is all lies and sickness \u2015 we should approach both valuations with care and consideration, even skepticism, but not with the intense ridicule so many of us have given them for so long.\n\nI cannot say for certain that a shift in the wider cultural acceptance of UFOs is already occurring in our institutions, as some have begun to state, but I can report what has occurred in my own consciousness. Since the \u201950s, intrepid investigators have spent their whole lives and careers dedicated to the phenomenon of UFOs and abductions, and here we are, possibly closer to the truth than ever. And yet I somehow feel no closer to understanding my father. I was not at his side while he lay on his deathbed, by choice \u2015 a choice I seemingly made as a child and never reassessed. I chose not to hear his last words, and that\u2019s hard for me to accept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough delusions are commonly encountered in schizophrenia and affective disorder, it turns out that anyone can have them,\u201d Mahzarin Banaji and John Kihlstrom stated in their 1996 research titled, \u201cThe Ordinary Nature of Alien Abduction Memories.\u201d \u201cThey are natural byproducts of our attempts to explain the unusual things that can happen to us.\u201d As has been the tradition with this topic, I have little certainty about what happened to my father; I can only say that something unusual happened to him, then he spent the rest of his life trying to make sense of it. And now I will spend the rest of my life trying to make sense of him.\n\nDavid Riedel, born and educated in Bosler, Wyoming, is a University of Wyoming graduate student whose writing often examines the realities of addiction and mental illness inside this strange, frightening world we all inhabit.

            "source": "Willamette Week",
            "article_content": "Last month, on the night of Dec. 7, multiple pilots saw lights in the sky over the Willamette Valley.\n\nAs several outlets reported, an audio recording of air traffic control that went viral features alarm over the lights\u2019 strange movements among pilots of two commercial airliners, United Flight 1596 and Horizon Air Flight 2207, the latter of which had a pilot who reported having seen the same phenomenon \u201ca few times over the last month in the same area\u201d near Eugene.\n\nWhatever they were seeing, it wasn\u2019t showing up on air traffic control\u2019s radar. It was, however, appearing on the crash avoidance system of a small Life Flight plane, Medevac 1LF, heading toward North Bend. Its pilot, Joe Buley, gave the most detailed description:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one way up high and one about at my altitude. Moving in\u2026like a corkscrew pattern. Moving at\u2026extreme speeds... It\u2019s a red circular shape and it keeps zipping out towards the ocean and then coming back in, about 20 miles or closer to us and then zips back out of the ocean.\u201d\n\nThe response from air traffic control: \u201cYou are cleared to maneuver as necessary\u2014a left or right to avoid the UFO out there.\u201d\n\nThis incident was not, by any stretch of the imagination, the first time anybody\u2019s reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. This isn\u2019t even the first time that a United Airlines flight has reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. The region has been an epicenter of postwar UFO sightings, with more people having reported sightings in Portland and Seattle than in any other metro area in the United States since 2000. (The U.S. government now designates such sightings as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d or UAPs.)\n\nIt was here that on June 24, 1947, an amateur pilot named Kenneth Arnold set off a national frenzy after he reported seeing \u201cnine saucerlike aircraft flying in formation\u201d above Southwest Washington while flying from Chehalis to Yakima. (Thus, like \u201cgrunge\u201d and \u201cvegan strip club,\u201d \u201cflying saucer\u201d became a product of the Pacific Northwest.) Ten days later, the crew of United Flight 105 reported a nearly identical experience while flying from Boise to Pendleton.\n\nIn 1950, an Oregon couple named Paul and Evelyn Trent took two pictures on their Kodak of a \u201cdisc-shaped object\u201d that supposedly hovered above their farm outside of McMinnville without emitting any sound. The pictures ended up in Life magazine and remain a point of contention between UFO skeptics and believers.\n\nIn the 75 years since, there\u2019ve been thousands of reported sightings across the Pacific Northwest. Regardless of personal opinions of such things, it\u2019s undeniable that during this time UFOs and little green men have embedded themselves into the cultural fabric of the region, another stitch alongside New Age crystal healers, Bigfoot true believers, and whatever it is that draws people to a full-size replica of Stonehenge on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge. McMinnville and Chehalis both now hold annual UFO festivals; the Royal Canadian Mint issues a coin commemorating a 1970 sighting in British Columbia.\n\nWhat happened last month over the valley, though, was different from anything else that\u2019s come before. The Dec. 7 incident represented legitimate documentation of multiple professional pilots seeing the same things and having the same reaction to them. In that audio recording, an unnamed pilot aboard Horizon Air Flight 2207 can be heard refuting what\u2019s become the standard explanation for what they saw\u2014satellites. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not Starlink, I promise,\u201d he says. \u201cI know what that looks like.\u201d Buley, the pilot of Medevac 1LF, also doubts this explanation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen satellites\u2026stuff like that. This was definitely different,\u201d he told KEZI-TV. (WW reached out to Life Flight Network but was told that Buley and the rest of his crew have declined to speak further on the matter.)\n\nIt\u2019s all very strange. Perhaps the UFO believers are right after all. If they are, and this is a real thing, then the greatest story of all time has been playing out above our backyard. Or maybe it\u2019s nothing at all."

            "article_content": "As a fifth grader, Josiah Golojuh faced a dilemma.\n\nHis teacher had assigned the class to write a descriptive essay about a family vacation, but Josiah hadn\u2019t been on a vacation he thought was interesting. So, Josiah wrote about a fictional vacation that included far-fetched interactions with the supernatural.\n\nJosiah\u2019s classmates voted his essay one of the best, and Josiah was hooked on writing fiction.\n\nJosiah Golojuh, 42, now lives in Huntington Beach, California, but his first novel, \u201cThe Paper Boy\u201d (Stage Beetle Books / 2024), is paranormal fiction inspired by the author\u2019s experiences growing up in Russellton \u2014 a small Allegheny County town about 20 miles northeast of Downtown Pittsburgh \u2014 and delivering newspapers in a trailer park in West Deer.\n\nInteracting with people on the paper route and listening to customers at his family\u2019s hair salon connected Josiah to his community. \u201cThat was how I began to learn character,\u201d he said.\n\nPenny Golojuh, 7, waits as her father, Josiah Golojuh, signs his book, \u201cThe Paper Boy,\u201d on Dec. 31, 2024. Penny and her sister, Primrose Golojuh, 5, designed the cover for one of their father\u2019s comic books. Photo by John Beale.\n\nIn addition to the inspiration gained from customers he met, the money earned delivering papers helped to fuel his passion for reading and collecting comic books. Decades later, Josiah started a comic book company and published three of his own comic books, sometimes featuring character namesakes of people from his childhood.\n\nJosiah moved to California in 2002 to attend the University of Southern California. He teaches writing at Coastline Community College, but he\u2019s quick to credit growing up in Russellton, population 1,200, with feeding his imagination for fiction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d walk over to Palmer\u2019s drugstore with my older brother to buy Slush Puppies. To a very small kid, that walk was like navigating the streets of a large city. The buildings felt gigantic,\u201d Josiah recalled.\n\nShelly Irvine of Curtisville talks with Josiah Golojuh, left, about his book. Josiah\u2019s daughter, Primrose Golojuh, 5, is seated next to her father. Photo by John Beale.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, Josiah returned to Russellton\u2019s Palmer Pharmacy to promote his book. By mid-morning, a dozen people formed a line that extended to the pharmacy counter next to a wall displaying orthopedic shoes. At the far end of the counter, a young man wearing a ball cap waited for a prescription near a display for live bait.\n\nSharpie in hand, the author and his two young daughters sat at a table facing a rack stacked with the latest edition of the newspaper Josiah delivered 30 years ago. Behind him, several customers sat on green-padded stools as they drank coffee at a soda fountain counter repurposed as a coffee bar. Josiah Golojuh, left, waits to sign his book, \u201cThe Paper Boy,\u201d as Josiah\u2019s father, George Golojuh, greets a visitor to the book signing event. Behind Josiah is his wife, Judy Golojuh. Photo by John Beale.\n\nThe Russellton pharmacy has been a hub in the community for decades, and the book signing resembled a homecoming of sorts. Josiah later said the gathering was \u201cmagical.\u201d His hometown no longer seemed so large.\n\nJosiah\u2019s wife and parents were there. Shirley Irvine came from Curtisville. Shirley\u2019s daughter, Erin Irvine Nemazee, from Northern Virginia was there with her two daughters. Erin was in a school play with Josiah. Gary Lutz of Gibsonia, one of Josiah\u2019s high school friends and a namesake for a character in one of Josiah\u2019s comic books, came to get a photo. Chris Cushman was there to buy a book. He and Josiah shared a seat on the school bus.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of you,\u201d a woman with short graying hair said with a smile as Josiah wrote an inscription inside her book.\n\nLater in the week, Josiah said he was welcomed during a visit to Deer Lakes Middle School to talk with students about his book and his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed with gratitude and humbled by my community,\u201d Josiah said. \u201cI may live somewhere else, but this will always be my home.\u201d"

The visualised podcast, made by Uncanny Media, Bafflegab and CC Lab, will air on BBC Two immediately after the TV episode, bringing fans a frightening Friday night full of 90 minutes of Uncanny. An extended version of the podcast will then be available on BBC Sounds.\n\nCelebrity ghost watchers including the likes of Kiell Smith-Bynoe, Meera Syal and Charlie Cooper as well as Uncanny regular experts such as Evelyn Hollow will join Danny alongside the lead witness at the heart of each story.\n\nUncanny: Post Mortem follows in the footsteps of the hugely successful Traitors: Uncloaked, presented by Ed Gamble, giving listeners exclusive behind the scenes access to The Traitors.\n\nDanny Robins says \"Our Uncanny cases are so intriguing and frankly bloody frightening that after watching an episode you always want to discuss it - chatting over theories on what happened and that biggest of all questions \"do ghosts exist?\" So now, brilliantly, we can do that in Uncanny: Post Mortem, directly after the main show. It's the kind of delicious deep dive you will be desperate to do after getting hooked on each of these strange chilling cases. You'll hear more from me, our experts, witnesses and some brilliant celebrity Uncanny fans. Expect new evidence and new leads! I can't wait!\"\n\nBBC Podcast & Formats Commissioner Rhian Roberts says \"The Uncanny podcast has been going since 2021, with the TV show joining the Uncanny universe last year. We know listeners and viewers absolutely love it, adding a visualised podcast is a great next step. Uncanny: Post Mortem will be where to head to find out just how freaked out we all were, we can be scared together! There are always so many fascinating questions that come into us after an episode of Uncanny, it\u2019s going to be brilliant to have another place to share theories.\"\n\nJack Bootle, the BBC\u2019s Head of Commissioning for Specialist Factual television, says \"The first TV series of Uncanny was a big hit with both sceptics and believers \u2013 and we know many wanted to learn more about the cases Danny was investigating. Uncanny: Post Mortem allows us to take a deeper dive into these spine-tingling stories, and to hear from celebrity fans of the series who may have had their own paranormal experiences. Friday night on BBC Two is about to become very spooky. Watch if you dare.\"\n\nUncanny: Post Mortem is a Bafflegab, Uncanny Media and CC Lab production for BBC Two and BBC Sounds.\n\nUncanny: Post Mortem begins on 31 January and will be available on BBC Two and iPlayer on Fridays immediately after the main show. An extended version of the podcast will be available on BBC Sounds. Previous episodes of Uncanny are available to catch up on BBC Sounds.\n\nRB2"

Or rather, was.\n\nThe name itself translates as 'stone heap of the wildcat', with a modern name for the site being Gilgal Refa\u02beim which translates as 'Wheel of Ghosts' or Wheel of Spirits'.\n\nMade up of almost 40,000 tonnes of stone, it is estimated to have taken more than 25,000 combined working days to have put the megalith together.\n\nSpooky theories surrounding Rujm el-Hiri\n\nHaving been first discovered in 1967 during an archaeological survey, it was only then excavated in 2007.\n\nAdvert\n\nExperts have ruled out it being a burial site given that no human remains are on the site.\n\nBut some still theorise that astronomical connections are behind it, connected to ancient cultures observing the stars and planets while others think it could be linked to rituals and offerings to gods.\n\nRujm el-Hiri is in Syria, north of Israel (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\nRujm el-Hiri new findings\n\nIn a new study on the monument, published in the journal Remote Sensing, new satellite images of Rujm el-Hiri have been analysed by scientists from Tel Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe findings put doubt on links to astronomy and the stars.\n\nInstead, it has been confirmed that the structure has physically moved over time.\n\nDue to Earth's tectonic plates moving over time - we're talking eight to 15 millimetres every year for the last 150 million years - there has been significant alteration to the walls and entrances of the structure.\n\nAs a result, the site has moved counterclockwise and moved the entire monument by tens of metres.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt's moved over time (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\n\"The findings show that the entrances and radial walls during that historical period were entirely different, reopening the question of the site\u2019s purpose,\" the research team says.\n\n\"This implies that the primary axes of Rujm el-Hiri have rotated over time along with the entire region, casting significant doubt on the popular theory that Rujm el-Hiri was an observatory.\"\n\nThe outer walls of Rujm el-Hiri were built between 5,000BC and 4,500BC."

            "article_content": "An illustration of five galaxies aligned like a string of pearls.\n\nAstronomers have discovered a rare group of five dwarf galaxies located relatively close to Earth; these galaxies exist in a near-perfect alignment, resembling a string of cosmic pearls in the sky.\n\nHeld together by their mutual gravity, several of the dwarf galaxies (designated D1 to D5) are rhythmically dancing with one another while others are engaged in a \"cosmic tug of war,\" ripping gas and stars away from each other.\n\nThe scientists behind this discovery say these factors make this dwarf galaxy grouping particularly intriguing. The arrangement may be as challenging as it is beautiful, potentially posing a problem for our best model of cosmic evolution.\n\nThe observed dwarf galaxies sit relatively close to Earth at just around 117 million light-years away.\n\n\"These galaxies are small, faint and rich in gas, yet all of them are actively forming new stars \u2014 a surprising trait for dwarf galaxies in a group,\" team leader Cristiano G. Sabiu of the University of Seoul told Space.com. \"Even more striking is their nearly perfect alignment in the sky, forming a distinct 'string of cosmic pearls.'\"\n\nThe galaxies were discovered via data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which mapped one-quarter of the entire sky over Earth in great detail, determining the positions and absolute brightnesses of hundreds of millions of celestial objects. Data from several other astronomical surveys also aided the discovery team.\n\nRelated: James Webb telescope spies stunning 'Firefly Sparkle' galaxy \u2014 a baby clone of the Milky Way being 'assembled brick by brick' in the early universe\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The total mass of these five dwarf galaxies appears to be around 60.2 billion solar masses (one solar mass being equivalent to the mass of the sun). For comparison, our galaxy, the Milky Way, is estimated to have a mass that is equivalent to around 1.5 trillion suns.\n\n\n\nThe most massive of these five dwarf galaxies (D2) has a mass equivalent to just 275 million suns. The least massive, D4, has a mass of just 14.7 million solar masses. That means, while D1 to D5 fit in well in terms of other dwarf galaxy characteristics, they are major outliers in terms of their companionship.\n\nDwarf galaxies tend to be fairly lonesome, with less than 5% found with close galactic companions. The chance of finding five dwarf galaxies grouped together as they are in this case is less than 0.004%.\n\n\"This unusual arrangement raises the question,\" Sabiu said. \"Is this alignment a mere coincidence, or does it hint at a deeper connection related to their formation and evolution?\"\n\nAn image of a rare grouping of five dwarf galaxies named D1 to D5. (Image credit: Podesta, et al)\n\nSabiu continued by explaining that the fact that three of these dwarf galaxies (D1, D2 and D5) share the same rotational direction adds to the uniqueness of this arrangement.\n\n\n\n\"It is as if performing a synchronized cosmic dance,\" Sabiu added. \"This could provide valuable clues about their shared origins or the role of their environment in shaping their motions.\"\n\nTwo dwarf galaxies are actively interacting in a galactic \"tug of war\" contest contributing to the mystery of this galactic grouping. This gravitational interaction pulls matter from the galaxies, forming visible \"tidal tails\u201d of gas and stars.\n\n\"Such interactions often trigger bursts of star formation and can significantly alter a galaxy\u2019s shape over time,\" Sabiu explained.\n\nSabiu explained why the discovery of these dwarf galaxies challenges our best theory of cosmic evolution, the standard model of cosmology, or the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model.\n\n\"This discovery poses a challenge to the LCDM model, as it may struggle to account for the formation of such small, aligned groups of galaxies in isolated environments,\" the researcher said.\n\nThe team's research was published in November in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nOriginally posted on Space.com."

            "article_content": "The sprawling grounds of France\u2019s opulent Palace of Versailles are not only a masterpiece of landscaping, but a mark of 17th-century engineering innovation. The property\u2019s ornamental fountains and ponds, for example, were only made possible by a specially built machine that pulled water from the Seine and pushed it up a steep hill to Versailles.\n\nThe machine was designed at the request of the French king Louis XIV\u2014the monarch who commissioned Versailles, also known as the Sun King. His and his successors\u2019 courts are mainly remembered for ostentatious finery, but their immense wealth also enabled discovery, and Versailles turned into a hotbed for science: a theme explored by a new exhibition at the Science Museum in London: \u201cVersailles: Science and Splendor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe exhibition highlights how science flourished at Versailles, from the kings\u2019 personal interest in luxurious scientific instruments and spectacular demonstrations, to its strategic role beyond the palace through newly founded institutions and scientific expeditions,\u201d says Glyn Morgan, the museum\u2019s curatorial lead for exhibitions, in a statement.\n\nThe show spans the 17th and 18th centuries, covering the reigns of Louis XIV (who founded the French Academy of Sciences in 1666), Louis XV and Louis XVI (who was executed in 1793 during the French Revolution). Through more than 120 artifacts, the exhibition illustrates the importance of art and science in the French royal court.\n\nMany of the objects show innovations in medicine, such as a curved scalpel designed by Louis XIV\u2019s royal surgeon, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9lix. When the king developed a royal anal fistula, his surgeon had to invent a customized scalpel. F\u00e9lix tested his tool on local peasants, killing several in the process. As the Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Jones writes, \u201cThe rehearsals worked: He fixed the royal fistula and Louis XIV lived on until 1715, his 72-year reign a world record.\u201d\n\nUnder the reign of Louis XV (who ruled between 1715 and 1774), a midwife called Madame du Coudray became a powerful force against French infant mortality. The king hired her to travel throughout rural France to train other midwives in the mechanics of birth, employing \u201csophisticated life-sized mannequins,\u201d per the statement. Du Coudray ultimately educated more than 5,000 women and physicians, and her last surviving model is on display in the exhibition.\n\nAfter Louis XV died of smallpox, his son and successor Louis XVI announced that the royal family would get inoculated. Included in the exhibition are posters made to reassure the public of the strategy\u2019s success.\n\nScience at Versailles extended to the wonders of the natural world. French botanists grew and studied exotic plants. Versailles had a menagerie stocked with animals like coatis and cassowaries. Visitors to the Science Museum will be able to see the menagerie\u2019s most famous resident: Louis XV\u2019s rhinoceros, given to the king by a French governor based in India and later dissected and taxidermied upon its death.\n\n\u201cAs it was studied by scientists, it became incredibly important to our growing zoological knowledge,\u201d as Morgan tells the Observer\u2019s Vanessa Thorpe. \u201cThe photographs really did not do justice to just how impressive and characterful it is. The skin is almost jet black.\u201d\n\nAlso on display are philosopher Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s handwritten, annotated French translation of Isaac Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica; the watch made for Louis XVI\u2019s wife, Marie Antoinette, by Abraham-Louis Breguet; and an early map of the moon drawn by Jean-Dominique Cassini in 1679. The French Revolution claimed the lives of some of the French royal court\u2019s thinkers, but their advances were permanent. Per the Guardian, \u201cScience strode on.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoyal ambition, scientific knowledge and ideals of beauty culminated at Versailles in spectacular demonstrations and brilliant innovations from the brightest minds of the time,\u201d says Ian Blatchford, director and chief executive of the Science Museum Group, in the statement. \u201cWe are thrilled to introduce our visitors to these fascinating stories through the stunning objects on display.\u201d\n\n\u201cVersailles: Science and Splendor\u201d is on view at the Science Museum in London through April 21, 2025."

Learn More \u203a\n\nA man unlocking his front door with a smart keypad.\n\nWe love any opportunity to see the debuts of fun, new, even futuristic gadgets\u2014who doesn\u2019t? But the home security technology unveiled at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) had our attention because of what it means for homeowners\u2019 safety, convenience, and savings.\n\nBased on what CES presented, we saw several home security trends emerge for protecting property, family, and packages. With corresponding technology offering everything from better sensors to sleeker designs, these are our predictions for home safety and security in 2025.\n\nPhoto: Lockly\n\n1. Sleeker, Design-Forward Security\n\nThough door knobs with smart locks have added numerical or touchscreen keypads, they still look relatively similar to traditional handles. As technology advances, however, we see companies focusing on more sleek, modern designs that not only incorporate additional features but also reimagine the standard design of smart handles.\n\nLockly Styla\n\nLoved by DIYers and professional builders alike, Lockly is leading the way in creating new looks and enhanced functionality with the Styla. This combination front door handle, smart deadbolt, and video doorbell fits into a cylindrical modern door pull most easily imaginable for high-end residential applications. And it fits a lot in a skinny profile. The video component has a motion sensor, a 2K camera with color night vision, and two-way audio. The smart lock works via a 3D fingerprint sensor, a PIN Genie pad with a randomizable keypad, an RFID reader with programmable fobs, and a traditional keyhole.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough its aesthetics push the envelope enough that they may take some getting used to, we think this and other innovative designs will continue to become more common. This all-in-one handle, lock, and video doorbell comes in matte black, gray, and gold and is battery-powered for easy installation and rechargeable via USB. The Styla also comes with Lockly\u2019s new Wi-Fi hub that privately stores recorded videos and audibly chimes rather than pinging your phone. Stay tuned for when the Lockly Styla becomes available later this year.\n\nPhoto: Schlage\n\n2. Better Sensors\n\nWhile most of us have seen smart locks with numeric buttons or touchscreen keypads, some recently released products indicate better and much harder-to-fool technology is on the way. Though we\u2019re only highlighting two popular CES products here, we predict many brands will be increasing their focus on lock sensors for home security soon.\n\nTCL Smart Lock D1 Pro\n\nThe TCL Smart Lock D1 Pro requires something much more unique than a four-digit code to unlock it: your palm. Though the D1 Pro was launched this past October, CES attendees couldn\u2019t help but flock to see its revolutionary operation. Among its seven unlocking methods, the most interesting by far is its use of AI technology to read and recognize the layout of veins in your palm. Like many other smart locks, it also works via keypad, app, cards, period passwords, standard keys, and voice assist via Google Home and Amazon Alexa. The lock features a 7,800mAh rechargeable battery and durable IP54 weather-resistant construction.\n\nGet the TCL D1 smart lock at Amazon for $179.99.\n\nSchlage Sense Pro\n\nAnother reputable leader in the home security market, Schlage introduced its new Sense Pro Smart Deadbolt at this year\u2019s CES. In addition to a standard touchscreen keypad for code entry, the smart deadbolt uses Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology paired with select personal devices of your choosing to enable hands-free and tap-to-unlock access. Connected to your smart home network, the lock can automatically calculate your speed and trajectory as you approach and unlatch on its own. The Sense Pro is expected to come out later this year.\n\nPhoto: Switchbot\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Increased Front Door Visibility\n\nWith video doorbells showing up next to more front doors every day, it\u2019s relatively standard to be able to check your phone when you hear a chime alerting you to a visitor. Still, it\u2019s not always the most convenient if you\u2019re on a call to see if there\u2019s cause for attention or alarm. Some households may include members without smartphones who can\u2019t access an app-only display. Two products that showed up at CES remedied this issue by integrating their own displays, hardwiring optional.\n\nSwitchBot Video Doorbell\n\nThe SwitchBot Video Doorbell combines a traditional-looking video doorbell with a 4.3-inch smart display screen you can sit on a surface or mount to the wall. The screen delivers live videos, notifies you if anyone arrives, lets you talk to visitors while keeping your door closed, and features 512GB of local storage.\n\nThe unit can be either wired or battery-powered, and SwitchBot will also offer a solar panel to ensure continuous operation. The 2K resolution camera has a 165-degree field of view and color night vision to help you identify visitors no matter the time of day. At the time of publication, no specifics on the SwitchBot Video Doorbell launch date have been announced yet.\n\nLockly Vision Prestige\n\nIn a similar push to enable front door visibility without relying on phones, Lockly will release its Vision Prestige smart lock later this year. Rather than casting video to a separate screen like the SwitchBot Video Doorbell, this lock has a display on its interior housing. It uses presence detection powered by bit radar and a 2K resolution camera with facial recognition to clock when a person is at the door, and the screen lights up when you touch it so you can identify that individual from the inside. It even boasts an intercom, like most video doorbell cameras, so that you can have a conversation through your front door.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Vision Prestige offers a few different means of securing the home, too: keyed entry, fingerprint recognition, and a patented pin entry. You can switch from a traditional touchscreen keypad to Lockly\u2019s PIN Genie, which places digits in random locations, guaranteeing safe entry into your home without revealing your code to prying eyes. We expect the Prestige\u2014an upgrade to the current Lockly Vision\u2014to drop near the end of the year.\n\nPhoto: Hyve\n\n4. Smarter Ways To Secure Deliveries\n\nWhile package delivery boxes and locking mailboxes aren\u2019t a totally new concept, more options have hit the market with smart features like remote locking and unlocking via app and automated video recording. And since package theft is a problem almost everyone has experienced, seen, or heard about, we predict package lockboxes with additional security features will continue to roll out.\n\nHyve Smart Home Delivery Pod\n\nThe Hyve smart home delivery pod may look somewhat similar to a standard front porch delivery box. Like other smart delivery boxes, users can lock and unlock the Hyve pod via an app and send unique codes to drivers, family members, and friends. But that\u2019s far from all this model offers. The box sounds a siren and sends a tamper alert to your phone if it detects anyone is attempting to access it without authorization. It also features a carbon-fiber tether to secure the entire unit to a column or railing, preventing would-be thieves from stealing the entire box. There\u2019s a window on top to allow drivers to take delivery confirmation photos, and Hyve is even compatible with package pickup software to help make arranging returns easier. You can join the waitlist for the smart package pod, expected to start shipping in June.\n\nThe Overlap Between Home Security and Internet Safety\n\nAs smart home security devices continue to evolve, their effectiveness increasingly relies on robust internet connectivity and cybersecurity. An IT expert from ORTIT, an IT consulting service in Frankfurt, highlights, \u201cEven the most sophisticated smart locks or video doorbells can be rendered vulnerable without a secure and well-managed network.\u201d Research supports this, showing that improperly secured systems are a leading cause of breaches in smart home setups.\n\nTo ensure both convenience and safety, integrating devices like video doorbells or smart locks with professional-grade network solutions is essential. This approach not only enhances device functionality but also safeguards against potential cyberattacks, protecting your family and home. ORTIT emphasizes that by addressing these gaps early, homeowners can avoid costly vulnerabilities while enjoying the full benefits of modern home security technology."

            "article_content": "Scientists studying a 5,000-year-old monument in the Middle East have made a startling discovery about the structure.\n\nCalled Rujm el-Hiri, it is often referred to as the 'Stonehenge of the East' due to its similarities to the English monument.\n\nOfficially called 'megalith' structures, it is scientific speak for prehistoric constructions put together using large stone with many of them found across Europe in particular; some 35,000 exist on the continent alone.\n\nAdvert\n\nRujm el-Hiri is not found in Europe, though, with it located in the Golan Heights region of Syria.\n\nRujm el-Hiri from the sky (MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhat is Rujm el-Hiri?\n\nRoughly 16 kilometres inland from the Sea of Galilee, it is made up of more than 42,000 rocks arranged in concentric circles.\n\nAdvert\n\nAt the middle of it all is a large mound of rocks that is 15 foot high at its tallest point, which is roughly 4.6 metres.\n\nBut to this day people aren't quite sure what the point of Rujm el-Hiri is. Or rather, was.\n\nThe name itself translates as 'stone heap of the wildcat', with a modern name for the site being Gilgal Refa\u02beim which translates as 'Wheel of Ghosts' or Wheel of Spirits'.\n\nMade up of almost 40,000 tonnes of stone, it is estimated to have taken more than 25,000 combined working days to have put the megalith together.\n\nSpooky theories surrounding Rujm el-Hiri\n\nHaving been first discovered in 1967 during an archaeological survey, it was only then excavated in 2007.\n\nAdvert\n\nExperts have ruled out it being a burial site given that no human remains are on the site.\n\nBut some still theorise that astronomical connections are behind it, connected to ancient cultures observing the stars and planets while others think it could be linked to rituals and offerings to gods.\n\nRujm el-Hiri is in Syria, north of Israel (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\nRujm el-Hiri new findings\n\nIn a new study on the monument, published in the journal Remote Sensing, new satellite images of Rujm el-Hiri have been analysed by scientists from Tel Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe findings put doubt on links to astronomy and the stars.\n\nInstead, it has been confirmed that the structure has physically moved over time.\n\nDue to Earth's tectonic plates moving over time - we're talking eight to 15 millimetres every year for the last 150 million years - there has been significant alteration to the walls and entrances of the structure.\n\nAs a result, the site has moved counterclockwise and moved the entire monument by tens of metres.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt's moved over time (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\n\"The findings show that the entrances and radial walls during that historical period were entirely different, reopening the question of the site\u2019s purpose,\" the research team says.\n\n\"This implies that the primary axes of Rujm el-Hiri have rotated over time along with the entire region, casting significant doubt on the popular theory that Rujm el-Hiri was an observatory.\"\n\nThe outer walls of Rujm el-Hiri were built between 5,000BC and 4,500BC."

            "article_content": "An illustration of five galaxies aligned like a string of pearls.\n\nAstronomers have discovered a rare group of five dwarf galaxies located relatively close to Earth; these galaxies exist in a near-perfect alignment, resembling a string of cosmic pearls in the sky.\n\nHeld together by their mutual gravity, several of the dwarf galaxies (designated D1 to D5) are rhythmically dancing with one another while others are engaged in a \"cosmic tug of war,\" ripping gas and stars away from each other.\n\nThe scientists behind this discovery say these factors make this dwarf galaxy grouping particularly intriguing. The arrangement may be as challenging as it is beautiful, potentially posing a problem for our best model of cosmic evolution.\n\nThe observed dwarf galaxies sit relatively close to Earth at just around 117 million light-years away.\n\n\"These galaxies are small, faint and rich in gas, yet all of them are actively forming new stars \u2014 a surprising trait for dwarf galaxies in a group,\" team leader Cristiano G. Sabiu of the University of Seoul told Space.com. \"Even more striking is their nearly perfect alignment in the sky, forming a distinct 'string of cosmic pearls.'\"\n\nThe galaxies were discovered via data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which mapped one-quarter of the entire sky over Earth in great detail, determining the positions and absolute brightnesses of hundreds of millions of celestial objects. Data from several other astronomical surveys also aided the discovery team.\n\nRelated: James Webb telescope spies stunning 'Firefly Sparkle' galaxy \u2014 a baby clone of the Milky Way being 'assembled brick by brick' in the early universe\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nDwarf galaxies dancing and holding hands\n\nAs the name implies, dwarf galaxies are low-mass realms with low stellar populations, which means they are also rather dim in terms of brightness. The total mass of these five dwarf galaxies appears to be around 60.2 billion solar masses (one solar mass being equivalent to the mass of the sun). For comparison, our galaxy, the Milky Way, is estimated to have a mass that is equivalent to around 1.5 trillion suns.\n\n\n\nThe most massive of these five dwarf galaxies (D2) has a mass equivalent to just 275 million suns. The least massive, D4, has a mass of just 14.7 million solar masses. That means, while D1 to D5 fit in well in terms of other dwarf galaxy characteristics, they are major outliers in terms of their companionship.\n\nDwarf galaxies tend to be fairly lonesome, with less than 5% found with close galactic companions. The chance of finding five dwarf galaxies grouped together as they are in this case is less than 0.004%.\n\n\"This unusual arrangement raises the question,\" Sabiu said. \"Is this alignment a mere coincidence, or does it hint at a deeper connection related to their formation and evolution?\"\n\nAn image of a rare grouping of five dwarf galaxies named D1 to D5. (Image credit: Podesta, et al)\n\nSabiu continued by explaining that the fact that three of these dwarf galaxies (D1, D2 and D5) share the same rotational direction adds to the uniqueness of this arrangement.\n\n\n\n\"It is as if performing a synchronized cosmic dance,\" Sabiu added. \"This could provide valuable clues about their shared origins or the role of their environment in shaping their motions.\"\n\nTwo dwarf galaxies are actively interacting in a galactic \"tug of war\" contest contributing to the mystery of this galactic grouping. This gravitational interaction pulls matter from the galaxies, forming visible \"tidal tails\u201d of gas and stars.\n\n\"Such interactions often trigger bursts of star formation and can significantly alter a galaxy\u2019s shape over time,\" Sabiu explained.\n\nSabiu explained why the discovery of these dwarf galaxies challenges our best theory of cosmic evolution, the standard model of cosmology, or the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model.\n\n\"This discovery poses a challenge to the LCDM model, as it may struggle to account for the formation of such small, aligned groups of galaxies in isolated environments,\" the researcher said.\n\nThe team's research was published in November in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nOriginally posted on Space.com."

Balancing Growth With Safety: The company highlights the importance of security measures while ensuring the equitable distribution of AI benefits.\n\nThe timing of this initiative is no coincidence. In December, Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s CEO, donated $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural fund. This move signals a calculated effort to strengthen ties with the incoming administration and influence its AI strategy.\n\nThe Stakes for AI Development in America\n\nThe competition to lead in AI is fierce. OpenAI\u2019s rivals, including xAI\u2014led by Elon Musk, an ally of incoming president Trump\u2014are scaling up investments in computing infrastructure. With the stakes so high, OpenAI\u2019s blueprint warns that delays in U.S. policy could redirect critical foreign investments to China.\n\nLehane framed the geopolitical challenge succinctly: \u201cAre those countries going to be building on U.S. rails or on CCP rails?\u201d The implications extend beyond economics, touching on national security and global AI dominance.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe economic blueprint represents OpenAI\u2019s effort to shape the Trump administration\u2019s approach to AI. With a focus on collaboration and innovation, OpenAI plans to host an event on January 30 to demonstrate its latest technology and engage with policymakers. This push underscores the critical role AI plays in America\u2019s economic and strategic future. While the debate over AI regulations continues, OpenAI\u2019s proposals aim to secure the U.S.\u2019s leadership in this transformative field, ensuring both growth and safety.\n\nLearn how to invest in AI to stay ahead of the curve and make the most out of AI opportunities offered by the likes of OpenAI\u2019s blueprint."

Some sites were hit, it said.\n\nFamilies huddle together in an underground station in Kyiv during the Russian bombardment - Alina Smutko/Reusters\n\nUkraine\u2019s underground gas storage facilities are located in the western part of the country and have become increasingly vital since a gas transit agreement Kyiv signed with Russia before the invasion expired on Jan 1.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTwo critical infrastructure sites in the Drohobych and Stryi districts of the Lviv region were damaged by cruise missiles, the governor Maksym Kozytskyi said.\n\nUkraine\u2019s largest gas storage facility is located about six miles north of Stryi.\n\nMr Kozytskyi added that two private houses and several outbuildings in the village of Sknyliv were damaged by rockets during the bombardment.\n\nThe capital Kyiv also came under attack, and hundreds of people took shelter in metro stations across the city, sleeping on yoga mats and sitting on folded chairs with their pets.\n\nUkrainian personnel use searchlights to find Russian drones over Kyiv - Gleb Garanich/Reusters\n\nNo deaths or injuries have so far been reported.\n\nThe Polish military later said that no violation of its airspace was recorded.\n\nRussian forces used a variety of air, land and sea-based missiles as well as Shahed attack drones and decoy drones designed to overwhelm air defence systems, the Ukrainian air force said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt said one Iskander ballistic missile was launched from the Belgorod region, while four Kalibr missiles were fired from the Black Sea.\n\nStrategic bombers fired 27 Kh-101/Kh-55 cruise missiles from the Volgograd region, while seven Kh-22/32 cruise missiles were launched from aircraft over Tula and four Kh-59/Kh-69 guided missiles were fired from \u201ctactical aircraft\u201d in Belgorod.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, met Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, in Warsaw on Wednesday - Aleksandra Szmigiel/Reusters\n\nSeventy-four drones, including Shahed attack drones and decoys, were fired from the cities of Bryansk, Millerovo, Oryol and Primorsko-Akhtarsk, the air force added.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky said: \u201cAnother massive Russian attack. It\u2019s the middle of winter and the target for the Russians remains unchanged: our energy infrastructure.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong their objectives were gas and energy facilities that sustain normal life for our people.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian president went on to say that \u201cwe must continue strengthening the capabilities of Ukraine\u2019s air shield\u201d.\n\n\u201cPromises made by partners at the Nato summit in Washington ... remain partially unfulfilled,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr Zelensky called on partners to give Ukraine licences to produce air defence systems and missiles on its own soil, which he said could serve as an effective security guarantee.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said: \u201cThis morning, the armed forces of the Russian Federation launched a group strike with high-precision weapons and attack drones on critical gas and energy infrastructure facilities that support the operation of Ukraine\u2019s military-industrial complex.\u201d\n\nThe attack came after Moscow vowed to respond to a Ukrainian bombardment of Russia on Tuesday, when UK and US-made missiles and more than 100 drones were launched at targets across the country.\n\nKyiv claimed it was its largest such attack of the war so far.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Zelenksy visited Poland on Wednesday for talks with senior officials on a range of issues, including continued support for Kyiv against Russia and the exhumation of Poles massacred by Ukrainian nationalists in the Second World War.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRussia has increased its attacks on Ukraine\u2019s power sector since March last year, knocking out half of the available generating capacity and forcing long, rolling blackouts across the country.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Derby\n\nReuters\n\nDevastating fires in the Los Angeles area are likely to put modest pressure on the U.S. national economy in the near term but are unlikely to derail strong forward momentum, economists say.\n\nForecasters reckon the fires\u2019 destruction of property and job market disruptions could put upward pressure on inflation as they also slow growth and put a modest brake on hiring, although not at a large enough level to fundamentally change the outlook.\n\n\u201cThe L.A. wildfires are shaping up to be the costliest climate disaster in U.S. history, which stems both from their size and the high value of the residential real estate they are destroying,\u201d said J.P. Morgan economist Abiel Reinhart.\n\nLos Angeles wildfires:US banks ready mortgage relief for affected homeowners\n\nNoting estimates placing the economic damage cost in the quarter-trillion-dollar range and outstripping the cost of Hurricane Katrina, Reinhart said \u201cwe think the short-term effect on national GDP growth, employment, and inflation will be small.\u201d The total size of U.S. domestic product was just shy of $30 trillion in 2023, for comparison.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists concurred and said past natural disasters offer clues for what to expect.\n\nThey foresee a 0.2 percentage point drag on first-quarter growth assuming that is not offset by rebuilding-related activity. Job growth in January is likely to be reduced by between 15,000 and 25,000 positions as a result of the fires, a relatively modest amount of drag in an economy that added 256,000 jobs in December, driven by the fact that only about 0.5% of California residents were under some form of evacuation order.\n\nGoldman Sachs forecasters do not expect the fires to push up immediate claims for unemployment insurance either.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts are roughly on the same page and project between a 20,000 and 40,000 drag on job creation levels. They note inflation pressures as measured by the consumer price index stripped of food and energy costs are likely to be four to nine basis points higher on fire impacts.\n\n\u201cThe shock seems to be on core goods prices, particularly, on used and new cars,\u201d the Morgan Stanley forecasters noted. \u201cWe find evidence of stronger used and new car inflation after wildfires\u201d based in similar disasters, while \"core goods ex-autos does not seem to be meaningfully affected.\u201d\n\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s Reinhart said \u201cwe expect localized upward pressure on rents, construction supplies, and residential construction labor, but limited national effects.\u201d\n\nThe relatively contained national economic impact of the California fires comes as the U.S. economy is entering 2025 on a strong footing and sticky levels of inflation. That said, the disaster adds to what was already a heightened level of economic uncertainty with the return of Donald Trump as president, having campaigned on a platform of huge tariff increases and the widespread deportation of undocumented immigrants.\n\nReporting by Michael S.

            "article_content": "This study explores how the integration of DevOps methodologies has transformed the management of cloud infrastructure, with a focus on the critical role of automation in achieving scalability. Originating as a response to the inefficiencies and challenges faced in traditional software development and IT operations, DevOps emphasizes a culture of collaboration and automation to enhance the speed and quality of software delivery. This transformation has been pivotal in addressing the \u201cfatal level of dysfunction\u201d perceived between development and operations, ultimately streamlining workflows and enabling faster, more reliable deployments.[1][2]\n\nAt its core, DevOps integrates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) by implementing practices such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), and automated monitoring. These practices facilitate a seamless and repeatable process for software development and deployment, reducing human error and ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages.[3][4][5] Automation tools, including AWS, Azure, GitLab, and Jenkins, play an essential role in managing infrastructure resources, enabling businesses to scale operations efficiently and respond quickly to market demands.[6][3]\n\nThe adoption of DevOps within cloud environments has introduced significant enhancements in scalability, largely through practices like containerization and microservices architecture. These technologies allow for greater application portability and resource optimization, thus supporting the efficient scaling of individual services and contributing to overall system reliability.[3][7] As DevOps continues to evolve, organizations are increasingly leveraging its principles to maintain a competitive advantage in dynamic markets, overcoming traditional infrastructure limitations and fostering innovation.[1][8]\n\nDespite its benefits, the implementation of DevOps is not without challenges, including the need for careful oversight and cultural shifts within organizations. The transition to a DevOps model requires buy-in across all levels to ensure successful collaboration and accountability, thereby maximizing the impact of automation and scalability practices in cloud infrastructure management.[4][9] As the industry continues to advance, DevOps is expected to play an even more integral role in shaping the future of cloud infrastructure, driving further adoption of cutting-edge practices and technologies.[1][6]\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThe evolution of DevOps in cloud infrastructure can be traced back to a growing recognition of dysfunction in the software development and IT operations industries in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During this period, proposals began to emerge advocating for the integration of software development methodologies with deployment and operations concepts[1]. However, it was not until around 2007 and 2008 that the DevOps movement started to gain significant traction. This surge was driven by mounting concerns within the IT and software development communities regarding the detrimental separation between development and operations, which was perceived to create a \u201cfatal level of dysfunction\u201d in the industry[2][1].\n\nDevOps was conceived as a methodological response to these challenges, emphasizing collaboration, culture change, and the adoption of specific practices and tools[1]. The movement sought to address the inefficiencies and slow delivery times of traditional software development and IT operations practices by integrating and automating their processes[1]. This integration aimed to improve the speed and quality of software delivery, thereby enhancing the overall systems development life cycle[1].\n\nAutomation has played a crucial role in the evolution of DevOps, particularly as businesses moved toward cloud infrastructure. The automation of cloud infrastructure allows for better scalability, monitoring, and efficiency, addressing some of the initial concerns that spurred the DevOps movement[6]. By adopting these automated practices, organizations can streamline their processes, focusing more on application development rather than the complexities of underlying infrastructure management[10].\n\nKey Concepts in DevOps\n\nDevOps is fundamentally a methodology in the software development and IT industry that focuses on the integration and automation of the work performed by software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). This approach is aimed at improving and shortening the systems development life cycle, ensuring that new features and improvements can be delivered to users more efficiently and with higher quality[1].\n\nOne of the core principles of DevOps is shared ownership, where development and operations teams work closely together to foster collaboration, streamline workflows, and enhance communication across all stages of the software delivery process. This cultural shift towards collaboration enables teams to address issues more rapidly and make informed decisions, resulting in a more responsive and agile environment[3][4].\n\nAnother key concept is workflow automation, which involves the use of tools and practices to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This automation is typically achieved through continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, which help businesses achieve shorter development cycles and faster time-to-market. Tools like GitLab CI/CD or Jenkins are widely used for creating and managing these pipelines, thus improving software quality and reducing human error[3][4].\n\nInfrastructure as code (IaC) is another critical element within DevOps, where infrastructure is managed and provisioned through code instead of manual processes. IaC enables consistent and repeatable configurations across environments, facilitates integration with CI/CD pipelines, and supports scalable infrastructure management. This approach ensures that infrastructure changes are aligned with software development, promoting efficiency and reducing the potential for configuration drift[11][12][5] .\n\nMoreover, the use of monitoring and logging practices within a DevOps framework is vital for maintaining system reliability and performance. These practices enable real-time analysis and proactive monitoring, allowing organizations to promptly address issues and ensure the delivery of reliable updates to customers[8]. Through these key concepts, DevOps empowers businesses to accelerate their cloud adoption journey, improve scalability, and maintain a competitive advantage in rapidly changing markets[4].\n\nDevOps Practices in Cloud Infrastructure\n\nDevOps practices play a crucial role in modern cloud infrastructure management by enabling organizations to achieve agility, collaboration, and efficiency throughout the cloud lifecycle. One of the foundational principles of DevOps in cloud environments is the implementation of infrastructure as code (IaC). IaC allows teams to define system resources and topologies in a descriptive manner, which can be stored and versioned in version control systems, offering a reliable, repeatable, and controlled way to deploy system resources[10][5] . This practice ensures that configurations are consistent across environments and can be easily edited and distributed[5] .\n\nAutomation is another pivotal element in DevOps practices, significantly enhancing scalability and efficiency. By fully automating infrastructure installation processes, organizations can eliminate the need for manual server provisioning, middleware building, and application code installation[13]. Tools such as AWS, Azure, GitLab, and Jira are commonly employed to overcome challenges associated with cloud automation, enabling businesses to enhance their scalability and monitoring capabilities[6].\n\nContinuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are also integral to DevOps practices, streamlining the build, testing, and deployment processes. Utilizing CI/CD tools like Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD, organizations can establish a seamless software delivery pipeline, facilitating frequent releases, faster feedback cycles, and improved software quality[3]. This automation minimizes human dependency for managing repetitive tasks, although some human oversight is still necessary when updates or troubleshooting are required[9].\n\nContainerization further simplifies deployment and management within cloud environments. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies into containers, businesses can achieve greater portability and resource utilization. Docker, for instance, allows containers to run on any infrastructure, ensuring consistent application performance across different environments[7].\n\nAchieving Scalability\n\nAchieving scalability in cloud infrastructure is a crucial component of DevOps practices. By leveraging containers, businesses encapsulate applications and their dependencies, which ensures portability and scalability while optimizing resource utilization[3]. This encapsulation simplifies the deployment and management of complex applications, allowing organizations to scale their operations effectively.\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) plays a vital role in scaling cloud infrastructure. IaC involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes, leading to more efficient and repeatable management of development, testing, and production environments[5] [8]. Tools like AWS CloudFormation enable developers to define and manage cloud resources, thus facilitating scaling beyond traditional infrastructure limitations[11].\n\nAutomation is another pivotal element in achieving scalability. Automation tools reduce the need for manual intervention, streamline processes, and allow for more efficient workload management[6][14]. This, in turn, helps DevOps teams increase efficiency and velocity, providing them with better control and visibility over their operations[14].\n\nFurthermore, adopting a microservices architectural style supports scalability. Microservices, characterized by small and independently deployable services, allow for continuous refactoring and scaling of individual services, which contributes to overall system efficiency and reliability[1]. This architectural style is becoming the standard for building systems that are continuously deployed, thus supporting organizational scalability[1].\n\nBest Practices for Automation and Scalability\n\nIn the context of cloud infrastructure management, automation and scalability are pivotal in ensuring efficient operations and fostering innovation. The integration of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) stands out as a primary practice in automating and managing infrastructure at scale. IaC enables developers and system administrators to manage infrastructure through code, treating it akin to application code, which promotes consistency and reduces the risk of human error[8][6]. This code-based approach allows for rapid deployment, updating, and duplication of infrastructure using standardized patterns, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages[8].\n\nOne of the foundational elements of DevOps is the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, which automates the build, test, and deployment processes. This approach streamlines software development, resulting in shorter development cycles and faster time-to-market[3]. The integration of IaC into CI/CD pipelines further enhances these processes by ensuring infrastructure changes are synchronized with software updates, leading to consistently reproducible configurations across different environments[11].\n\nAutomation tools such as AWS, Azure, GitLab, and Jenkins are instrumental in achieving scalability and efficiency in cloud infrastructure. These tools facilitate monitoring, scaling, and managing infrastructure resources, thereby helping businesses maintain a reliable system capable of promptly responding to customer needs and market demands[6][3]. Automation also aids in monitoring IT infrastructure performance, generating alerts for availability, performance, or security issues, which is critical for maintaining the integrity and functionality of fast-moving DevOps environments[9].\n\nAdditionally, embracing a DevOps culture that emphasizes collaboration, ownership, and accountability can improve team dynamics and operational efficiency[8]4]. This cultural shift supports the implementation of agile project management and continuous feedback loops, which are crucial for the evolution of DevOps in achieving both automation and scalability in cloud infrastructure[15].\n\nImpact of DevOps on Cloud Infrastructure Management\n\nThe integration of DevOps practices has significantly transformed cloud infrastructure management by emphasizing automation, collaboration, and scalability. DevOps practices eliminate the traditional need to manually provision servers, build middleware, and install application code, instead relying on automated processes that are documented, repeatable, verifiable, and traceable[13]. This automation not only accelerates infrastructure installation but also enhances reliability and efficiency in managing cloud environments[3].\n\nA fundamental aspect of DevOps is the adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which allows organizations to manage their development, testing, and production environments in a repeatable and efficient manner[8]. IaC minimizes human dependency for managing basic, recurring tasks, thereby reducing risks associated with manual interventions[9]. By implementing continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, organizations can ensure that all changes to code infrastructure and application updates are both safe and functional, promoting a seamless transition from development to production environments[4].\n\nMoreover, DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration among software developers and operations teams, which leads to improved processes that save both time and money[4]. This collaborative culture is supported by powerful tools for configuration management, containerization, and CI/CD, which together empower businesses to achieve greater agility and efficiency throughout the cloud lifecycle[3].\n\nDespite its advantages, the transformation to a DevOps model requires careful oversight and human intervention when necessary. Even well-automated processes can encounter unforeseen issues that necessitate human expertise to resolve[9]. Nevertheless, the emphasis on automation within DevOps remains a cornerstone of effective cloud infrastructure management, enabling organizations to scale their operations efficiently and respond promptly to customer needs[4][9].\n\nCase Studies\n\nAdoption of Automation in DevOps\n\nOne prominent case study illustrating the transformation brought by DevOps in cloud infrastructure management is that of a large-scale financial services firm. The organization faced challenges in managing complex systems and ensuring rapid deployment without compromising stability. By adopting DevOps practices, particularly focusing on automation, they achieved a more streamlined workflow. The implementation of automated testing\u2014encompassing unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests\u2014was pivotal in reducing deployment errors and improving the speed of delivery[15][16].\n\nThe firm utilized infrastructure as code to manage their environments, enabling them to replicate development, testing, and production setups efficiently. This approach not only reduced risks associated with system changes but also promoted consistency across environments[8]. As a result, the company experienced enhanced scalability in their cloud infrastructure, allowing them to adapt swiftly to changing demands.\n\nCultural Shift and Performance Metrics\n\nAnother case study involves an e-commerce company that embraced DevOps to overcome the inefficiencies inherent in their legacy systems. A crucial aspect of their transition was the cultural shift towards continuous communication and trust within teams. The company focused on breaking down silos and fostering a culture where ownership and accountability were emphasized[16][8].\n\nThe 2023 State of DevOps report noted that the company adopted updated performance metrics to better assess the effectiveness of their deployments. The switch from \u201cmean time to recover\u201d to \u201cfailed deployment recovery time\u201d provided clearer insights into their system\u2019s resilience, addressing previous ambiguities[1]. This metric adjustment was part of a broader strategy to implement Lean and Agile methodologies, contributing to the company\u2019s improved ability to respond to market demands swiftly.\n\nThese case studies exemplify how organizations have leveraged DevOps to enhance their cloud infrastructure management through automation and cultural transformation, achieving greater scalability and operational efficiency[17][1][8].\n\nFuture Trends in DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure\n\nThe future of DevOps in cloud infrastructure is poised for significant evolution, driven by the continuous advancements in automation and scalability. As organizations strive for greater agility and efficiency, the integration of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) will become even more prevalent. This approach allows teams to manage infrastructure using code, creating consistent and reliable environments while reducing human error through automation [6][8]. The adoption of IaC is expected to deepen, facilitating the deployment of infrastructure using standardized patterns that are repeatable, verifiable, and traceable [13].\n\nAutomation tools will continue to play a crucial role in managing complex environments at scale. With the increasing demand for seamless operations, these tools will help teams handle the velocity of changes characteristic of DevOps practices [8]. Furthermore, the use of containerization and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines will likely become more widespread, particularly with the rise of Kubernetes. Automating the processes of building, deploying, and monitoring containers will be essential, allowing teams to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management[10].\n\nMicroservices architecture is anticipated to become more dominant in the DevOps landscape, given its compatibility with continuous deployment systems. The modular nature of microservices allows for iterative and rapid development, aligning well with DevOps principles [1]. This architectural style will likely be complemented by serverless computing, which reduces the complexity of deployment and operations by eliminating the need for server configuration and maintenance [10].\n\nAs cloud providers continue to innovate, DevOps teams will benefit from enhanced services that streamline application lifecycles and accelerate product delivery. For example, AWS offers various services tailored for DevOps, enabling developers and system administrators to automate operational tasks efficiently [8][18]. The ongoing evolution of cloud services will empower organizations to maximize their cloud adoption journey and achieve sustainable success through DevOps[3].\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Wikipedia contributors.

            "article_content": "Scientists studying a 5,000-year-old monument in the Middle East have made a startling discovery about the structure.\n\nCalled Rujm el-Hiri, it is often referred to as the 'Stonehenge of the East' due to its similarities to the English monument.\n\nOfficially called 'megalith' structures, it is scientific speak for prehistoric constructions put together using large stone with many of them found across Europe in particular; some 35,000 exist on the continent alone.\n\nAdvert\n\nRujm el-Hiri is not found in Europe, though, with it located in the Golan Heights region of Syria.\n\nRujm el-Hiri from the sky (MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhat is Rujm el-Hiri?\n\nRoughly 16 kilometres inland from the Sea of Galilee, it is made up of more than 42,000 rocks arranged in concentric circles.\n\nAdvert\n\nAt the middle of it all is a large mound of rocks that is 15 foot high at its tallest point, which is roughly 4.6 metres.\n\nBut to this day people aren't quite sure what the point of Rujm el-Hiri is. Or rather, was.\n\nThe name itself translates as 'stone heap of the wildcat', with a modern name for the site being Gilgal Refa\u02beim which translates as 'Wheel of Ghosts' or Wheel of Spirits'.\n\nMade up of almost 40,000 tonnes of stone, it is estimated to have taken more than 25,000 combined working days to have put the megalith together.\n\nSpooky theories surrounding Rujm el-Hiri\n\nHaving been first discovered in 1967 during an archaeological survey, it was only then excavated in 2007.\n\nAdvert\n\nExperts have ruled out it being a burial site given that no human remains are on the site.\n\nBut some still theorise that astronomical connections are behind it, connected to ancient cultures observing the stars and planets while others think it could be linked to rituals and offerings to gods.\n\nRujm el-Hiri is in Syria, north of Israel (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\nRujm el-Hiri new findings\n\nIn a new study on the monument, published in the journal Remote Sensing, new satellite images of Rujm el-Hiri have been analysed by scientists from Tel Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe findings put doubt on links to astronomy and the stars.\n\nInstead, it has been confirmed that the structure has physically moved over time.\n\nDue to Earth's tectonic plates moving over time - we're talking eight to 15 millimetres every year for the last 150 million years - there has been significant alteration to the walls and entrances of the structure.\n\nAs a result, the site has moved counterclockwise and moved the entire monument by tens of metres.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt's moved over time (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\n\"The findings show that the entrances and radial walls during that historical period were entirely different, reopening the question of the site\u2019s purpose,\" the research team says.\n\n\"This implies that the primary axes of Rujm el-Hiri have rotated over time along with the entire region, casting significant doubt on the popular theory that Rujm el-Hiri was an observatory.\"\n\nThe outer walls of Rujm el-Hiri were built between 5,000BC and 4,500BC."

Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nEli Shukron, who directed the excavation for the IAA, said, \u201cThe structure ceased to function during the 8th century BCE, possibly as part of King Hezekiah\u2019s religious reform. According to the Bible, Hezekiah sought to centralize worship at the Temple in Jerusalem, abolishing the ritual sites scattered across the kingdom. The Bible describes how, during the First Temple period, additional ritual sites operated outside the Temple, and two kings of Judah \u2014 Hezekiah and Josiah \u2014 implemented reforms to eliminate these sites and concentrate worship at the Temple.\u201d\n\nShukron described how they knew the site dated to the 8th century, roughly the period of King Hezekiah,\n\n\u201cWhen we began excavating the City of David in 2010, we discovered that the site had been sealed with fill from the 8th century BCE, indicating it had fallen out of use during that time,\u201d says Shukron. \u201cThe standing stone we uncovered remained upright in its original place, and the other rooms in the structure were also well-preserved.\u201d\n\nIn the book of 2 Kings, Hezekiah is described as a king who \u201cdid what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.\u201d\n\nThe Bible also describes Hezekiah\u2019s reforms of popular worship intended to focus the people\u2019s worship at the temple Solomon built.\n\n\u201cHe removed the high places and broke the pillars and cut down the Asherah. And he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had made offerings to it (it was called Nehushtan). He trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel, so that there was none like him among all the kings of Judah after him, nor among those who were before him\u201d (2 Kings18:4-5).\n\nThe structure found by Shukron\u2019s team is the only known structure of its type from the biblical period in Jerusalem, and one of only a few found in Israel. The eight-room structure covers about 220 square meters.\n\nZe\u2019ev Orenstein, the director of internal affairs at the City of David, told Fox News, \u201cNearly 3,000 years later, Jerusalem's Biblical heritage continues to be unearthed in the City of David, and with the passage of time, its relevance and meaning only continues to increase, with significance to billions, not just millions, around the world.\u201d\n\n\"This discovery in the City of David once again affirms the Jewish people's ongoing 3,000+ year-old bond with Jerusalem \u2013 not simply as a matter of faith, but as a matter of fact \u2013 from Bible times to the modern day,\" Orenstein said.\n\nThis article was originally published by All Israel News."

            "source": "Willamette Week",
            "article_content": "Last month, on the night of Dec. 7, multiple pilots saw lights in the sky over the Willamette Valley.\n\nAs several outlets reported, an audio recording of air traffic control that went viral features alarm over the lights\u2019 strange movements among pilots of two commercial airliners, United Flight 1596 and Horizon Air Flight 2207, the latter of which had a pilot who reported having seen the same phenomenon \u201ca few times over the last month in the same area\u201d near Eugene.\n\nWhatever they were seeing, it wasn\u2019t showing up on air traffic control\u2019s radar. It was, however, appearing on the crash avoidance system of a small Life Flight plane, Medevac 1LF, heading toward North Bend. Its pilot, Joe Buley, gave the most detailed description:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one way up high and one about at my altitude. Moving in\u2026like a corkscrew pattern. Moving at\u2026extreme speeds... It\u2019s a red circular shape and it keeps zipping out towards the ocean and then coming back in, about 20 miles or closer to us and then zips back out of the ocean.\u201d\n\nThe response from air traffic control: \u201cYou are cleared to maneuver as necessary\u2014a left or right to avoid the UFO out there.\u201d\n\nThis incident was not, by any stretch of the imagination, the first time anybody\u2019s reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. This isn\u2019t even the first time that a United Airlines flight has reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. The region has been an epicenter of postwar UFO sightings, with more people having reported sightings in Portland and Seattle than in any other metro area in the United States since 2000. (The U.S. government now designates such sightings as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d or UAPs.)\n\nIt was here that on June 24, 1947, an amateur pilot named Kenneth Arnold set off a national frenzy after he reported seeing \u201cnine saucerlike aircraft flying in formation\u201d above Southwest Washington while flying from Chehalis to Yakima. (Thus, like \u201cgrunge\u201d and \u201cvegan strip club,\u201d \u201cflying saucer\u201d became a product of the Pacific Northwest.) Ten days later, the crew of United Flight 105 reported a nearly identical experience while flying from Boise to Pendleton.\n\nIn 1950, an Oregon couple named Paul and Evelyn Trent took two pictures on their Kodak of a \u201cdisc-shaped object\u201d that supposedly hovered above their farm outside of McMinnville without emitting any sound. The pictures ended up in Life magazine and remain a point of contention between UFO skeptics and believers.\n\nIn the 75 years since, there\u2019ve been thousands of reported sightings across the Pacific Northwest. Regardless of personal opinions of such things, it\u2019s undeniable that during this time UFOs and little green men have embedded themselves into the cultural fabric of the region, another stitch alongside New Age crystal healers, Bigfoot true believers, and whatever it is that draws people to a full-size replica of Stonehenge on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge. McMinnville and Chehalis both now hold annual UFO festivals; the Royal Canadian Mint issues a coin commemorating a 1970 sighting in British Columbia.\n\nWhat happened last month over the valley, though, was different from anything else that\u2019s come before. The Dec. 7 incident represented legitimate documentation of multiple professional pilots seeing the same things and having the same reaction to them. In that audio recording, an unnamed pilot aboard Horizon Air Flight 2207 can be heard refuting what\u2019s become the standard explanation for what they saw\u2014satellites. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not Starlink, I promise,\u201d he says. \u201cI know what that looks like.\u201d Buley, the pilot of Medevac 1LF, also doubts this explanation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen satellites\u2026stuff like that. This was definitely different,\u201d he told KEZI-TV. (WW reached out to Life Flight Network but was told that Buley and the rest of his crew have declined to speak further on the matter.)\n\nIt\u2019s all very strange. Perhaps the UFO believers are right after all. If they are, and this is a real thing, then the greatest story of all time has been playing out above our backyard. Or maybe it\u2019s nothing at all."

            "article_content": "Scientists studying a 5,000-year-old monument in the Middle East have made a startling discovery about the structure.\n\nCalled Rujm el-Hiri, it is often referred to as the 'Stonehenge of the East' due to its similarities to the English monument.\n\nOfficially called 'megalith' structures, it is scientific speak for prehistoric constructions put together using large stone with many of them found across Europe in particular; some 35,000 exist on the continent alone.\n\nAdvert\n\nRujm el-Hiri is not found in Europe, though, with it located in the Golan Heights region of Syria.\n\nRujm el-Hiri from the sky (MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhat is Rujm el-Hiri?\n\nRoughly 16 kilometres inland from the Sea of Galilee, it is made up of more than 42,000 rocks arranged in concentric circles.\n\nAdvert\n\nAt the middle of it all is a large mound of rocks that is 15 foot high at its tallest point, which is roughly 4.6 metres.\n\nBut to this day people aren't quite sure what the point of Rujm el-Hiri is. Or rather, was.\n\nThe name itself translates as 'stone heap of the wildcat', with a modern name for the site being Gilgal Refa\u02beim which translates as 'Wheel of Ghosts' or Wheel of Spirits'.\n\nMade up of almost 40,000 tonnes of stone, it is estimated to have taken more than 25,000 combined working days to have put the megalith together.\n\nSpooky theories surrounding Rujm el-Hiri\n\nHaving been first discovered in 1967 during an archaeological survey, it was only then excavated in 2007.\n\nAdvert\n\nExperts have ruled out it being a burial site given that no human remains are on the site.\n\nBut some still theorise that astronomical connections are behind it, connected to ancient cultures observing the stars and planets while others think it could be linked to rituals and offerings to gods.\n\nRujm el-Hiri is in Syria, north of Israel (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\nRujm el-Hiri new findings\n\nIn a new study on the monument, published in the journal Remote Sensing, new satellite images of Rujm el-Hiri have been analysed by scientists from Tel Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe findings put doubt on links to astronomy and the stars.\n\nInstead, it has been confirmed that the structure has physically moved over time.\n\nDue to Earth's tectonic plates moving over time - we're talking eight to 15 millimetres every year for the last 150 million years - there has been significant alteration to the walls and entrances of the structure.\n\nAs a result, the site has moved counterclockwise and moved the entire monument by tens of metres.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt's moved over time (Olga Khabarova et al, Remote Sensing)\n\n\"The findings show that the entrances and radial walls during that historical period were entirely different, reopening the question of the site\u2019s purpose,\" the research team says.\n\n\"This implies that the primary axes of Rujm el-Hiri have rotated over time along with the entire region, casting significant doubt on the popular theory that Rujm el-Hiri was an observatory.\"\n\nThe outer walls of Rujm el-Hiri were built between 5,000BC and 4,500BC."
