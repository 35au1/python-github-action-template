            "article_content": "A lot of AI tools promise something like magic. Just write down all the stuff you need to do, or better yet, just let the tool record every second of your life, and presto manifesto, it\u2019ll do\u2026 something. Buy plane tickets, maybe, or magically reorder your calendar to maximize your flow state. The idea is huge and enticing, that you could just live your life and your AI assistant will make everything happen on your behalf. But hardly any of it works.\n\nThe developers of the app Twos are taking a much more cautious and, as a result, much more actually useful approach. Twos is an app for taking notes, managing to-dos, and generally making lists of any and every kind \u2014 Parker Klein, the app\u2019s creator, just calls it \u201ca place to write things down.\u201d Klein has been working on the app for nearly a decade, first as a tool just for himself and most recently as a true startup. I\u2019ve been using Twos off and on for a couple of years, and there\u2019s a lot to like about the app.\n\nThe Twos AI approach, which Klein and cofounder Joe Steilberg call \u201csmart suggestions,\u201d is to use AI to help you simply take the first step in getting something done. If you write down the name of a movie, Twos might offer you a link to a JustWatch search or the IMDb page for that movie. If you write a person\u2019s name and phone number, it can add them to your contacts with one tap. If you\u2019re making a grocery list, it\u2019ll send you to Amazon or Walmart or Instacart to buy it.\n\nThe logic behind all these suggestions is really simple: Twos looks for certain words and phrases to determine what you\u2019re trying to do and which integration makes the most sense. (You can pick and choose, too \u2014 I never use Uber Eats, for instance, so I turned that off entirely.) All the smart suggestions really do is take the first step. They\u2019re definitely not perfect \u2014 when I type \u201cbake blueberry muffins,\u201d it offers me an Allrecipes link, which is helpful and relevant, and a Google Maps search for \u201cblueberry muffins around me,\u201d which is not. But even in the feature\u2019s early days, I\u2019ve found it way more useful than almost every other, vastly more ambitious productivity tool.\n\nLike any to-do list app worth its valuation, Twos now has an AI chatbot. Image: Twos\n\nTwos also has a built-in chatbot, which you can use to ask questions about your notes. If you use your note-taking app like a journal, this can be really cool \u2014 \u201cwhat was the name of that Thai food place we went to a few weeks ago?\u201d is a surprisingly common question in my life. Lots of apps have something like this, and they all suffer from the same problem: if you don\u2019t put everything in the app, the search isn\u2019t that useful. But whether it\u2019s Notion or Dropbox or Twos, the AI integrations reward the heaviest users.\n\nAI turns Twos into not just my to-do list but the jumping-off point for all my tasks. Since the app works across platforms \u2014 it\u2019s fundamentally a web app, but there are versions for Android and iOS, Windows and Mac, and more \u2014 it\u2019s easy to just dump information into. Then, when it\u2019s time to leave for the restaurant I wrote down and promptly forgot the name of, I open Twos, tap the sparkles that appear next to any item with a smart suggestion, and it opens Google Maps and directs me there. You can store and organize things inside of Twos, but I find myself using it transiently, just for the small things in day-to-day life. I need to make bread: click the sparkles, bread recipes appear. Remember to buy those Sesame Street bath toys for the kid: click the sparkles, Amazon search done. Ollie\u2019s birthday is December 7th: click the sparkles, in my contacts.\n\nFor now, the Twos smart suggestions are only available in beta testing, and there\u2019s a waitlist for new users. (Though Klein did tell me that if you sign up and use the code \u201cVerge,\u201d you\u2019ll be able to skip the line.) Klein and Steilberg are working on more integrations and more ways to do even more with just a few words of your writing. They\u2019re obviously enticed by how far this might go. Why not automatically buy the toys or start the grocery delivery and take a cut for themselves? It\u2019s an age-old idea, that one. Any.do tried it years ago; there was even a frenzy of apps like Magic that would do it all via text message. Even the Alexa business model used to depend on you being willing to just shout \u201cbuy toilet paper\u201d at your speaker and trust it to do the rest.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with the idea: it doesn\u2019t work. There are too many logistical questions, too many ways to screw it up, and too many consequences for getting it wrong that it\u2019s not going to work anytime soon. If ever."

            "article_content": "As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionize various industries, the demand for AI-powered apps is increasing rapidly. Whether it\u2019s chatbots, predictive analytics, or personalized experiences, businesses across sectors are leveraging AI to stay competitive. However, one of the most common questions that arise during the planning phase of app development is: how much does it cost to make an app?\n\nIn this blog, we will break down the key factors that influence the cost of developing an AI app and provide insights into what businesses can expect in 2025.\n\n1. Complexity of the AI Features\n\nThe first and most significant factor that affects the cost of developing an AI app is the complexity of the features you want to integrate. AI apps can range from simple to highly sophisticated systems, and the cost varies accordingly.\n\nSimple AI Features:\n\nBasic functionalities like natural language processing (NLP) or simple chatbots can be implemented with off-the-shelf AI models. These are less costly and can be developed within a few months, making them more affordable.\n\nAdvanced AI Features:\n\nApps with deep learning, computer vision, or real-time AI analytics will require more time, expertise, and resources. For example, an app using computer vision for object detection or an AI-powered recommendation system will need custom models, vast data sets, and training processes, which significantly increase development costs.\n\n2. Development Team and Expertise\n\nThe expertise of the development team plays a critical role in determining the cost of AI app development. In 2025, you can expect the cost to vary based on the location, experience, and specialization of the team.\n\nAI Developers : Developers with experience in AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras will be essential for building advanced AI features. The higher the expertise, the higher the cost.\n\n: Developers with experience in AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras will be essential for building advanced AI features. The higher the expertise, the higher the cost. Data Scientists : If your app requires a large dataset to train AI models, you will need skilled data scientists to handle data collection, cleaning, and processing. They play a vital role in ensuring the accuracy of the AI algorithms.\n\n: If your app requires a large dataset to train AI models, you will need skilled data scientists to handle data collection, cleaning, and processing. They play a vital role in ensuring the accuracy of the AI algorithms. UX/UI Designers: For apps that require seamless integration of AI features with user interfaces, UX/UI designers with expertise in AI-enabled design will be crucial.\n\nThe geographical location of your development team also matters. Development costs in North America or Western Europe tend to be higher compared to countries like India or Eastern Europe, where the cost of skilled talent is lower.\n\n3. App Platform (iOS, Android, Web)\n\nThe platform you choose for your AI app (iOS, Android, or Web) will affect the development cost. For instance, building an app for multiple platforms (cross-platform development) increases the time and effort required to develop, which can raise the cost.\n\nNative App Development : Developing native apps for iOS and Android involves creating separate codebases for each platform, which can increase development time and costs.\n\n: Developing native apps for iOS and Android involves creating separate codebases for each platform, which can increase development time and costs. Cross-Platform App Development: Using frameworks like Flutter or React Native can reduce development time and costs by enabling code reuse across platforms, but it may not fully support the most complex AI features.\n\n4. AI Data Collection and Training\n\nAI models require vast amounts of data for training, and this process can be both time-consuming and costly. The cost of data collection, processing, and cleaning can significantly impact the overall development budget.\n\nData Acquisition : If your AI app requires proprietary data (like customer behavior data), you may need to invest in purchasing or gathering that data, which can be expensive.\n\n: If your AI app requires proprietary data (like customer behavior data), you may need to invest in purchasing or gathering that data, which can be expensive. Data Labeling : For machine learning models, data labeling is an essential task. It involves categorizing data to help the AI understand and learn from it. Depending on the volume of data, this task can be labor-intensive and costly.\n\n: For machine learning models, data labeling is an essential task. It involves categorizing data to help the AI understand and learn from it. Depending on the volume of data, this task can be labor-intensive and costly. Data Storage and Cloud Services: AI apps require powerful infrastructure to store and process large datasets. Cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure are commonly used, and their pricing depends on the amount of data stored and processed.\n\n5. Integration with Third-Party Services\n\nMany AI apps require integration with third-party APIs or services to provide additional functionality. For example, integrating AI with payment gateways, voice recognition services, or mapping tools can increase the overall cost.\n\nAPI Costs : Some third-party APIs, such as those for NLP or speech recognition (like Google Cloud AI or IBM Watson), charge based on usage. These costs should be factored into the development budget, especially for apps with high traffic or usage.\n\n: Some third-party APIs, such as those for NLP or speech recognition (like Google Cloud AI or IBM Watson), charge based on usage. These costs should be factored into the development budget, especially for apps with high traffic or usage. Cloud AI Services: Instead of building AI models from scratch, you can use cloud-based AI services from providers like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. These services can help reduce development time, but they may come with a recurring cost depending on usage.\n\n6. Maintenance and Updates\n\nThe cost of developing an AI app doesn\u2019t end once the app is launched. AI apps require continuous monitoring, updates, and improvements to ensure they continue to perform effectively and accurately.\n\nModel Optimization : As AI models are exposed to more data, they need to be optimized regularly to improve their accuracy and performance. This requires ongoing development and data processing, which adds to the long-term cost.\n\n: As AI models are exposed to more data, they need to be optimized regularly to improve their accuracy and performance. This requires ongoing development and data processing, which adds to the long-term cost. App Updates and Scaling: As your user base grows and new features are added, the app may need to be scaled. This involves not only technical updates but also potential infrastructure upgrades to handle more data and traffic.\n\n7. Security and Compliance\n\nSince AI apps often deal with sensitive data, ensuring robust security is critical. For industries like healthcare, finance, or legal, the app must comply with regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, or other data protection laws.\n\nSecurity Features : Implementing advanced security protocols like encryption, authentication, and secure APIs adds to the overall cost.\n\n: Implementing advanced security protocols like encryption, authentication, and secure APIs adds to the overall cost. Compliance: For AI apps that need to comply with industry regulations, the cost of ensuring compliance through audits, documentation, and security measures can increase significantly.\n\nEstimated Cost of Developing an AI App in 2025\n\nGiven all the factors above, the cost of developing an AI-powered app in 2025 can vary greatly depending on the complexity and requirements. Here\u2019s a rough estimate of what you can expect:\n\nBasic AI App : $50,000 \u2013 $150,000\n\n: $50,000 \u2013 $150,000 Intermediate AI App with Custom Features : $150,000 \u2013 $500,000\n\n: $150,000 \u2013 $500,000 Advanced AI App with Complex Models and Data: $500,000 \u2013 $2 million+\n\nConclusion\n\nDeveloping an AI app in 2025 is a significant investment influenced by various factors like complexity, data requirements, and team expertise.

So if you have an Android phone and have been wanting to make some music with Suno away from your computer, you now have the freedom to do so.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Suno AI, the company behind the app describes it as an AI music studio. Similar to how other generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, work, it\u2019s able to generate a result based on whatever prompt you submit. In this case, it can turn text into up to four-minute full songs.\n\nSuno AI isn\u2019t the only AI music generator out there, but it sets itself apart by being able to create everything from the instrumentals to the vocals and lyrics. In the clip below, you can hear an example of a song Rolling Stone made using the AI.\n\nRolling Stone \u00b7 Soul Of The Machine The AI-powered app first made waves back in December 2023 when it partnered with Microsoft to create a plugin for Copilot. Its ability to generate music that sounds as if it were created by a human artist helped jettison its popularity. Now, if you go into the Google Play Store and search for Suno AI, you\u2019ll find a listing for the app.\n\nIn addition to having the ability to create your own songs, you\u2019ll be able to browse creations from other users. You can also curate your songs and follow other creators.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints about the app is the audio quality. However, Suno recently released an update that fixed this issue and introduced a new ReMi (pronounced \u201cray me\u201d) lyric writer that can produce edgier lyrics.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

            "article_content": "I love a good show about teenagers fighting supernatural entities while also facing the mortifying ordeal of being a high school student. So Netflix\u2019s Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld, which not only sees a superpowered teenage girl battle demons but also draws from Chinese mythology, seems like it was created in a lab just for me. From the first trailer, I had high expectations. With bright, bold colors and character designs, compelling character relationships, and some very funky monsters and action sequences, it really checked all my boxes.\n\nBut there\u2019s one specific scene that I can\u2019t stop thinking about, because it so perfectly exemplifies the tone of this show and why it works so well.\n\n[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld.]\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nJentry Chau vs. the Underworld kicks off when 16-year-old Jentry (Ali Wong) learns that a demon is after her for the powers she\u2019s suppressed for most of her life. She must return to her hometown in Texas with her great-aunt Gugu (Lori Tan Chinn) in order to close a portal to the underworld and prevent more monsters from wreaking havoc in the world. All the while, she tries to fit in with her new (old?) classmates and slowly learns more about her own past and Gugu\u2019s refusal to reveal more about her parents.\n\nAbout halfway through the show, Jentry discovers that Kit (Woosung Kim), the new boy at school with big, dreamy eyes, is actually a Painted Skin demon from Chinese mythology. This means that he\u2019s actually a long-limbed shadowy demon who must construct elaborate disguises out of human skin to conceal his true form. Jentry is initially hurt by this revelation, but she eventually seeks his help to create a skin form in her image for a heist.\n\nCue a montage where the two of them carefully sew together a Jentry skin in Kit\u2019s dimly lit workshop while a soft romantic song plays. Kit cuts into a roll of flesh so that it best replicates Jentry\u2019s body, and gently tilts her face up so he can measure her chin. Jentry is mildly disgusted when Kit rifles through a bin of body parts and asks him to warn her when he picks the eyes, to which he replies he already knows the exact match for her eyes, because he\u2019s imagined them so often \u2014 and Jentry blushes.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nIt\u2019s a bit gross. It\u2019s incredibly intimate. It\u2019s uncanny, yet super romantic. It\u2019s adorably reminiscent of a budding high school romance, and also like something out of The Silence of the Lambs. But it\u2019s emblematic of how showrunner Echo Wu has marvelously leaned into the wonderfully weird, both with the paranormal elements and the more grounded stakes.\n\nThe show leans pretty hard on the more terrifying aspects of Chinese mythology, like a trip to Diyu, the Daoist version of hell, where souls are tortured for eons. The bright colors and cartoonish character designs keep the show firmly planted in PG territory, but it does get a bit freaky, in a good way. At one point, for instance, the house ghosts need to generate some more ectoplasm, so one of them volunteers to be brutally maimed \u2014 off screen, but with some screaming \u2014 in order to generate just a splash of magical ghost fluid. And even with those darker elements, the tone never gets too dire, and a lot of the fun comes from the weird situations and paranormal entities that Jentry and her friends encounter.\n\nAnd because Wu is tapping into a cultural mythos that American animation hasn\u2019t fully explored, none of the supernatural plotlines feel overdone (do we really need another broody vampire when we can have a Painted Skin demon?). American cartoons have long flirted with Chinese mythology, without actually delivering. American Dragon: Jake Long and The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, two animated shows that aired in the mid-2000s, also featured a young Chinese American protagonist guided by an elderly relative to battle monsters \u2014 but both shows primarily prioritized Western mythology, only incidentally pulling in Chinese legends. Jentry Chau does the reverse: By default, everything Jentry encounters is from Chinese mythology, mixing in other cultural perspectives without assuming that the default is Western. It\u2019s a unique lens, and one that really lets the show shine and avoid any trite cliches.\n\nJentry Chau vs the Underworld. Ali Wong as Jentry in Jentry Chau vs the Underworld. Cr. COURTESY OF NETFLIX \u00a9 2024 Image: Netflix\n\nBut even with the fun paranormal side, Wu never loses sight of the show\u2019s more realistic threads. At the end of the day, Jentry is a teenage girl who just wants to be normal. Her relationships with her friends, her secretive great-aunt, and her own self might be colored by the paranormal, but they all feel very rooted in realism. The scene with Kit works so well because even though it\u2019s a demon making a skin costume, it\u2019s also about teenage crushes and complicated feelings (and the fact that those complicated feelings stem from your crush actually being a demonic creature). Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld certainly isn\u2019t the only high school supernatural romp out there, but Wu takes care to balance the fantastical elements with the real ones.\n\nStill, the show works so well because Wu isn\u2019t afraid to get weird. As both a coming-of-age story and a supernatural show, Jentry Chau could easily fall into some cliched genre pitfalls. But Wu doesn\u2019t let that happen, simply by embracing the funkier beats and really letting them sing. It\u2019s in the little details in the background, like Jentry\u2019s Lisa Frank leopard poster and Gugu\u2019s crocs. And it\u2019s also in the bigger scenes, like that romantic moment between Jentry and Kit, set against the sewing of a flesh suit. Now that\u2019s something special \u2014 and the whole show is a special, weird gem that sparkles with neon intensity.\n\nJentry Chau vs. the Underworld is available to stream on Netflix now."

Then combine warm water and dry ice. That will turn the solid ice into a gas. Pour the gas into the tank. The bubbles will float, and a cloud will form above a layer of clear gas.\n\nWhat It Teaches: This experiment teaches kids about phase changes, combustion reactions, and gas laws.\n\nDiscovery Lab Director of Education, Chip Lindsey said, \"You get iridescent rainbows on the bubbles, so what causes that? You see that the bubbles begin to float down through the carbon dioxide, what causes that? All of those questions are like an entry point to really talk about basic properties of physics, chemistry, and even biology.\"\n\nHow Can I Learn More?\n\nThe Discovery Lab will be doing these fire and ice experiments and activities daily in its Science Lab.

Credit: NASA\n\nThe astronomical confusion started at 2 a.m ET on June 26, 2023.\n\nScientists using the powerful James Webb Space Telescope sought to observe a planet beyond our solar system (an exoplanet) called Kepler-51d, an unusual \"puffy\" world with a cotton candy-like density. But it passed into view two hours earlier than expected. That's strange for a planet, as they are usually quite predictable.\n\nIt turns out that a previously unknown world, and its potent gravity, altered Kepler-51d's orbit. Now there are four known planets orbiting the sun-like star Kepler-51, located some 2,556 light-years away. And at least three of them are puffy.\n\n\"If trying to explain how three super puffs formed in one system wasn\u2019t challenging enough, now we have to explain a fourth planet, whether it\u2019s a super puff or not. And we can\u2019t rule out additional planets in the system either,\" Jessica Libby-Roberts, an astronomer at Penn State who led the observation, said in a statement.\n\nThe research was recently published in The Astronomical Journal.\n\nBased on previous observations, the astronomers calculated that the distant world Kepler-51d would pass in front of its star on June 26, 2023, at 2 a.m. It was a valuable opportunity to use starlight shining through the planet's atmosphere to reveal what's transpiring on this mysterious orb. (This starlight passes through the exoplanet's atmosphere, then through space, and ultimately into instruments called spectrographs aboard Webb, a strategy called \"transit spectroscopy.\" They're essentially hi-tech prisms, which separate the light into a rainbow of colors. Certain molecules, like water, in the atmosphere absorb specific types, or colors, of light. If a color doesn't show up for Webb, that means it got absorbed by the exoplanet's atmosphere \u2014 revealing its presence.)\n\nBut nothing came at 2 a.m. \"Thank goodness we started observing a few hours early to set a baseline, because 2 a.m. came, then 3, and we still hadn\u2019t observed a change in the star\u2019s brightness with APO [the Apache Point Observatory also used during these observations],\" Libby-Roberts explained.\n\nTheir data, however, captured a dip in the star's light around midnight. What could have caused the surprise orbital change? Only the gravitational influence of a large, previously unknown fourth planet, the researchers concluded. It's now earned the name \"Kepler-51e.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories? Sign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter. Loading...

This marks the first planet discovered by transit timing variations using JWST.\"\n\nAn illustration showing the three puffy known worlds orbiting in the star system Kepler-51. Credit: NASA / ESA / L. Hustak / J. Olmsted / D. Player / F. Summers (STScI)\n\nIt's unknown if Kepler-51e is a puffy world, too. Astronomers will need to gather valuable observations from a transit in front of its star. What's known is that its orbit travels a little wider than Venus' orbit around the sun, and dwells on the edge of its solar system's habitable zone \u2014 a temperate region where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.\n\nAny puffy world is a curiosity: They might evolve, for example, into a super-Earth planet. In this star system, scientists already have at least three to continue observing. What will the fourth reveal?\n\nThe Webb telescope's powerful abilities\n\nThe Webb telescope \u2014 a scientific collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency \u2014 is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. But as shown above, it's also examining intriguing planets in our galaxy, along with the planets and moons in our solar system.\n\nHere's how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and likely will for decades to come:\n\n- Giant mirror: Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two-and-a-half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. The telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. \"We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed,\" Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.\n\n- Infrared view: Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer wavelengths than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through cosmic clouds; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.\n\n\"It lifts the veil,\" said Creighton.\n\n- Peering into distant exoplanets: The Webb telescope carries specialized equipment called spectrographs that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets \u2014 be they gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb looks at exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we'll find?\n\n\"We might learn things we never thought about,\" Mercedes L\u00f3pez-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics-Harvard & Smithsonian, told Mashable in 2021.\n\nAlready, astronomers have successfully found intriguing chemical reactions on a planet 700 light-years away, and have started looking at one of the most anticipated places in the cosmos: the rocky, Earth-sized planets of the TRAPPIST solar system.\n\nFeatured Video For You 10 mind-blowing discoveries from the James Webb Telescope"

            "article_content": "Phase change in phase-change memory PCM was accidentally triggered not by heating, but by a steady current, which means much less consumption and a plethora of technical prospects.\n\nScientists may have accidentally overcome a major hurdle for the deployment of next-generation data storage technologies. Using a material called indium selenide (In2Se3), researchers discovered the possibility of reducing the energy needs of phase-change memory PCM (capable of storing data without constant power) \u2014 by up to 1 billion times.\n\nThe discovery is an important step towards creating so-called universal memory, which combines the properties of RAM and data storage devices. RAM is fast but takes up a lot of space and requires a constant power source to operate. Solid-state drives are much denser and can store data when computers are turned off. Universal memory combines their best features.\n\nPCM works by switching materials between two states: crystalline, where atoms are neatly organized, and amorphous, where atoms are arranged randomly. This encodes values 1 and 0 by changing the state of the matter. However, the technology used for this involves heating and rapidly cooling materials and requires a lot of energy.\n\nResearchers found a way to completely bypass the melt-quenching process, instead causing amorphization through an electrical discharge. This drastically reduces the energy needs of PCM and opens up prospects for expanded commercial application.\n\nThe discovery is based on the unique properties of indium selenide, a semiconductor material with both ferroelectric and piezoelectric characteristics. Ferroelectric materials can spontaneously polarize, meaning they can generate an internal electric field without needing an external charge. Piezoelectric materials physically deform when subjected to an electric charge. Testing the material, researchers noticed that its regions became amorphous when subjected to a continuous current. Moreover, this happened completely by accident.\n\n\u201cI actually thought I might have damaged the wires. Normally you would need electrical pulses to cause any amorphization. Suddenly, the continuous current disrupted the crystalline structure, which shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d said Gaurav Modi, a doctoral student in materials science and engineering at Penn Engineering.\n\nFurther analysis revealed a chain reaction caused by the semiconductor\u2019s properties. It starts with tiny deformations in the material, caused by the current, which triggers an \u201cacoustic jerk\u201d \u2014 a sound wave similar to seismic activity during an earthquake. It travels through the material, creating amorphization in micrometric areas in a process researchers compared to an accelerating avalanche.\n\nThe scientists explain that the properties of indium selenide, including its dual ferroelectric and piezoelectric structure, work together to provide a path for amorphization with an ultra-low level of energy, triggered by impacts. This could lay the foundation for future research into new materials and devices for low-power electronic and photonic devices. The research is published in Nature.\n\nSource: LiveScience"

            "article_content": "LambdaTest partners with Autify to enable seamless real-device testing for faster onboarding and cost-effective mobile app automation\n\nNoida/San Francisco, Dec. 5 (Korea Bizwire) \u2013 LambdaTest, a leading unified testing platform, is proud to announce its partnership with Autify, a no-code testing platform for native mobile applications.

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nYou sit down at your computer, push the power button just like you do every day, and...nothing happens. Maybe the computer doesn't turn on at all, or it could power up but shut right back down. As far as you're concerned, there's nothing obviously wrong here, so why won't the computer just start? Before you panic, or begin looking for a new laptop to buy, let's first make sure this isn't something you can fix yourself. Here are some troubleshooting steps that can help narrow down the issue.\n\n1. Give It More Power\n\nAre you sure the computer is charging? If the machine isn't turning on at all\u2014no fans are running, no lights are blinking, and nothing appears on screen\u2014you probably have a power issue. Plug your computer directly into a wall outlet you know is working, rather than a power strip or battery backup that may be failing. Make sure the power switch on the back of your power supply is flipped on, and if the outlet is connected to a light switch, make sure that switch is turned on too.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you're using a laptop, make sure the charger is plugged in properly and to the correct port\u2014if it charges via USB-C, only some of the USB ports may actually provide power. A failing power supply can often cause boot problems, even if the fans and lights do turn on. So if the troubleshooting steps in this guide fail you, it might be time to replace your power supply.\n\n2. Check Your Monitor\n\nIf the computer sounds like it's turning on but you don't see anything on the screen, the computer may be booting and the monitor just isn't showing an image. Check to make sure your monitor is plugged in (again, try a wall outlet instead of a power strip), turned on, and set to the right input using the buttons on the side or bottom. Make sure the cable connecting the monitor to your computer hasn't come loose, become damaged, or is in any way at fault.\n\nTo completely rule out a problem with the monitor, plug your PC into another display\u2014or even a TV\u2014and see if you can get a picture that way. If you can, it's possible you need a new monitor. And this may sound silly, but make sure the brightness is turned up on your laptop. I\u2019ve had multiple people ask me for help with a computer that won\u2019t start, only to find the brightness was turned all the way down, creating a black screen.\n\nThe Best Laptop Deals This Week*\n\n*Deals are selected by our commerce team\n\n3. Listen for the Beep\n\nWhen your computer boots, it may make a beeping sound\u2014usually a single beep means everything is A-Okay. But if the computer is having trouble starting up, it may make a series of beeps (kind of like Morse code) that tell you what's wrong. Check the manual for your computer (or the PC's motherboard, if you built it yourself) and figure out what the beeps mean. If you don't have your manual, you can probably find it on the manufacturer's website.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf your computer doesn't beep at all, you might be out of luck, though some desktop PCs may have a header on the motherboard where you can install a cheap speaker, or even a digital display with a numerical code that corresponds to an error message.\n\n4. Unplug Unnecessary USB Devices\n\nBefore continuing, unplug anything superfluous from your computer\u2014webcams, USB headsets, external hard drives, etc. Try booting with just a keyboard and mouse (or even without them, if in dire straits) to see if one of your USB devices is causing a conflict.\n\nIn some circumstances, it may not even be the device itself, but the port on your computer. I\u2019ve owned a PC that couldn\u2019t get into Windows if something was plugged into the front USB port\u2014once booted, the ports would work fine, but it needed to be empty during the boot process. The more variables you can eliminate, the better.\n\n5. Reseat the Hardware Inside\n\nThere's a chance a component of your computer has come loose inside the case, especially if it was recently transported somewhere or if you were working inside it. If you're comfortable opening the computer up, remove the side panel and make sure the components are properly seated in their respective sockets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPay special attention to components like your RAM, graphics card, motherboard cables, and heatsink. Remove these items completely, then plug them back in, ensuring they click in all the way. You might also try booting without certain hardware, like the graphics card or one of the RAM sticks, in case they're faulty. (And if it doesn\u2019t work with one RAM stick, try the other.)\n\n6. Explore the BIOS\n\nDoes your computer only show the POST screen but can't boot into Windows? Certain settings may be causing the problem. For example, an error stating that your computer can't find a bootable operating system may mean your BIOS is set to boot from the wrong drive or your overclock settings are causing the computer to blue screen immediately. Enter your BIOS when the POST screen appears, usually by pressing Delete, F2, or some other key to enter setup.\n\nIf you've tweaked any of these settings recently, try changing them back. Make sure your Boot Order is set to the correct hard drive, your RAM is recognized, and that your CPU isn't overheating (if it's above 90 degrees Celsius in the BIOS, something is definitely wrong). You might also turn off the Fast Boot feature, in case a recent Windows Update is conflicting with it.\n\nIf all else fails, try resetting your BIOS settings across the board using the Load Optimized Defaults option. Just be sure to snap a few photos of your BIOS settings so you can set them back if that doesn't work.\n\n7. Scan For Viruses Using a Live CD\n\nIt's possible you have some nasty malware that's preventing your computer from booting. But with a live environment like Hiren's Boot CD, you can boot your computer from a CD or USB drive and scan the drive for malware without booting into Windows. Download the ISO image from this page, and follow the instructions to \"burn\" it to a USB flash drive.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nReboot your computer and access the Boot menu\u2014usually by pressing F11, F12, or some other key defined at startup. Choose your USB drive from the boot menu, and it should boot into Hiren's live environment. From there, head into Utilities > Security and run a virus scan with ESET and a malware scan with Malwarebytes. If either program finds anything, it'll let you know and attempt to fix it, which will hopefully allow you to boot into Windows once again.\n\n8. Boot Into Safe Mode\n\nIf you're getting the Blue Screen of Death at startup, it could be a bad application, driver issue, or hardware quirk causing the problem. Do a web search for the stop code that appears and see if it gives you any insight into what's wrong. Chances are, though, you'll have to boot into Safe Mode to fix the problem. This is harder than it used to be, but if you interrupt the boot process three times\u2014say, by pressing the reset button as Windows tries to boot\u2014it will take you to the Automatic Repair screen, where you can click Advanced Options.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a Windows installation drive using another PC and boot from that directly, choosing your language and selecting Repair Your Computer when given the option. Either of these methods should eventually get you to the Choose an Option screen, where you can click Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Startup Settings and reboot the computer. (If you don't see the Startup Settings option, you may need to click See More Recovery Options along the bottom.)\n\nYour computer should then give you the option to boot into Safe Mode, Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode with Command Prompt. You can try any of these, though Safe Mode is probably your best bet, or Safe Mode with Networking if you need to access the internet. This will load Windows with only the most crucial drivers and services running.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf you installed any new hardware recently, try uninstalling its drivers from Safe Mode. If you think a new application might be to blame, get rid of that too. BlueScreenView can help you look back through your most recent Blue Screens of Death to see the file that caused the problem, or any bug check strings and codes to look up.\n\n9. Roll Back a Problematic Windows Update\n\nIf you recently installed a Windows Update\u2014or the OS updated in the background on its own\u2014it may have caused a conflict that rendered your computer inoperable. It\u2019s annoying, but Windows does offer the option to roll back to the previous version, even if you can\u2019t get into Windows itself.\n\nHead back to the Troubleshoot > Advanced Options menu using the instructions above, then choose Uninstall Updates. Try uninstalling the latest Quality Update or Feature Update. If you\u2019re lucky, this may get you back into Windows, at which point you can delay Windows updates until the kinks are worked out.\n\n10. Check Your Hard Drive for Corruption\n\nIt's possible some data on your drive is corrupt, preventing Windows from booting properly. Thankfully, Microsoft has a few tools that can attempt to fix the problem. Head to the Troubleshoot > Advanced Options menu as described above and choose Command Prompt. Type the following command and press Enter:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis will tell Windows to check your drive for corruption and attempt to repair any problems. You can do a broader search for file corruption and bad sectors by entering the following:\n\nIf you have multiple drives, there's another command you can run (just replace the drive letter with the correct one from the resulting list):\n\n11. Repair a Busted Boot Loader\n\nSometimes your Windows installation is fine, but the boot loader\u2014the data that governs Windows' boot process\u2014is corrupted. This often happens if you clone your hard drive, create a new drive partition, or dual-boot Linux and mess something up along the way. You\u2019ll often get a message saying \u201cError loading operating system,\u201d \u201cInvalid partition table,\u201d or \u201cFATA: No bootable medium found! System halted.\"\n\nIf you have a good backup, you can try to repair the boot loader using Windows\u2019 built-in tools by going to Troubleshoot > Advanced Options as described above, then choosing Startup Repair. I wouldn\u2019t attempt these steps unless your files are backed up, as messing with partitions can always risk the loss of data. You can also run the Command Prompt from this menu and try running one of the following commands:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work, repairing the boot loader may be more complicated due to newer EFI boot loaders\u2014you can see instructions on doing so here\u2014but it may be easier and faster to reinstall Windows from scratch and restore from a backup.\n\n12. Test the Drive in Another PC and Pray\n\nIf all else fails, and you don\u2019t have a backup, take your storage drive out of the computer, connect it to a USB adapter, dock, or enclosure, and plug it into another known working PC. If you don\u2019t have another PC, try booting from a Linux Live CD on your current machine. As long as the drive is still working\u2014a big \"if\"\u2014you can at least copy your files onto an external drive for safekeeping before reinstalling Windows or sending the PC in for repairs."
