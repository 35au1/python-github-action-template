            "article_content": "If 2024 is going to be remembered for anything, it likely will be remembered as the first year that generative AI took hold of the cultural zeitgeist. It seemed everywhere you looked, you saw something about AI. At Google, the company went all-in on AI, injecting its Gemini systems into pretty much every product and service it offers.\n\nAs it turns out, this also applies to its security teams. The Google Play security team, for example, just released its annual report on what\u2019s been happening behind the scenes as they protect us all from harmful apps, bad developers, malware, and other issues. In 2024, this team stopped more bad apps than any other year prior \u2014 2.36 million apps, to be precise, which is wild to even think about. Google says that AI played a considerable role here.\n\nAccording to Google, human app reviewers on the Google Play security team used AI in their work in 92% of cases. That\u2019s a massive amount. Google claims AI tools help the team act more quickly and take more accurate action against developers who are trying to sneak bad apps onto the Play Store.\n\nThe Google Play security team is not the only way we are protected from bad apps, though. In 2024, Google also introduced a bunch of new security features to its Play Protect service that prevent attackers that do get through its defenses from doing any significant harm to you. Here are three examples:\n\nReminder to turn on Play Protect: The Play Protect service on Android phones scans all apps \u2014 whether they come from Google Play or the wider internet \u2014 for viruses, malware, and other attacks. Sometimes, user turn this feature off so that they can install something they know to be safe. To help prevent attacks during this Play Protect downtime, Chrome now reminds users to turn Play Protect back on if it has been turned off.\n\nThe Play Protect service on Android phones scans all apps \u2014 whether they come from Google Play or the wider internet \u2014 for viruses, malware, and other attacks. Sometimes, user turn this feature off so that they can install something they know to be safe. To help prevent attacks during this Play Protect downtime, Chrome now reminds users to turn Play Protect back on if it has been turned off. Disabling Play Protect toggle during calls: One method attackers use to exploit Android users is to call them and ask them to turn Play Protect off during the call. To combat this, Android now disables the Play Protect toggle during both regular calls as well as voice calls through popular chat apps. In order to toggle Play Protect off, you would need to end the call first, which will hopefully be enough time for the user to figure out that that\u2019s not a great idea.\n\nOne method attackers use to exploit Android users is to call them and ask them to turn Play Protect off during the call.

Automatic permissions revoking: When you install and use an app, you sometimes need to grant it permissions. Sometimes, the app you\u2019ve installed is malicious, and the permissions you\u2019ve granted it put you in danger. Now, Play Protect automatically revokes permissions for apps like these. The user can still manually restore those permissions if they want to, but once again, this will give that malicious app less of an opening to do any damage.\n\nConsidering how many Android devices are out there (over two billion) and how open the Android ecosystem is compared to other operating systems, it\u2019s a wonder it isn\u2019t completely overrun with bad actors. Many people reading this have likely never faced a significant security problem on their Android device, which is a direct result of what the Google Play security team does every day."

So, that's the coolest part about this building specifically.\"\n\nThe crew even attempts to contact one specific prisoner \u2014 Glenn \u2014 at the very spot he was murdered. \"Can you make this ball of light turn on?\" Bernstein asks, immediately resulting in a strange array of lights.\n\nWatch it all in Episode 11 directly below.\n\nREAD MORE: Inkcarceration Festival 2025 Full Daily Lineups Revealed\n\nAbout Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival and Danny Wimmer Presents\n\nInkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival is held each year at the historic Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield.\n\nConstruction began back in 1886 and the prison was operational from 1896 through 1990 and it was also used in a scene in the classic movie, The Shawshank Redemption. While the prison remains open to tourism, the most exciting moment of the year is certainly when the fest rolls into town for a long weekend of rock and metal.\n\nFans are already looking forward to the 2025 installment, which takes place July 18, 29 and 20 with headliners Falling in Reverse, Slipknot and Five Finger Death Punch.\n\nInkcarceration is one of many of Danny Wimmer Presents' premiere festivals.

            "article_content": "Josh Stewart Answers the Phone in 'Lifeline' Paranormal Thriller Trailer\n\n\"Can we push back this deadline that you've set?\" Dark Sky Films has revealed an official trailer for indie thriller Lifeline, from director Feras Alfuqaha. Yet another hotline thriller focusing on a person answering a phone - this night he receives an odd, paranormal call. There have been a few of these recently - including The Guilty with Jake Gyllenhaal or Tessa Thompson's The Listener. In Lifeline, a suicide hotline operator gets a late-night call from someone who claims to be him, knowing private details only he would know, and threatening to end his life in an hour. The operator must race against time to stop \"himself\" from suicide. Josh Stewart stars as Steven Thomas, along with August Maturo, Charlene Amoia, Jocelyn Ayanna, Nicole Santiago, Jill Awbrey, & Brecken Merrill. This also reminds me of the film Frequency (2000) about a father and son connecting across time through the phone. Lifeline looks much better than it sounds.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Feras Alfuqaha's film Lifeline, direct from YouTube:\n\nA late-night suicide hotline operator named Steven Thomas (starring Josh Stewart) receives a disturbing call from someone claiming to be him, knowing personal details only he would know. The caller threatens to end his life within the hour, forcing the operator into a tense, emotional race against time. As the clock ticks down, he must confront his deepest fears and uncover the truth before it's too late to save \"himself.\" Lifeline is directed by the indie producer / filmmaker Feras Alfuqaha, now making his feature directorial debut after producing a number of other projects as well. The screenplay is written by Brady Morell and Brian Price. Produced by Feras Alfuqaha and Leal Naim. Dark Sky Films will debut Alfuqaha's Lifeline film in select US theaters + on VOD starting on February 21st, 2025 coming soon. Who wants to watch this?"

            "article_content": "The earth has been for long remained dependent on coal as a major source of energy before scientists discovered various different resources including thermal, solar, biomass or later nuclear energy. Now a new study claims to have discovered a massive reserve of hydrogen beneath the earth surface which could power the planet for decades and centuries to come. The research shows that earth may be holding trillions of tons of hydrogen reserves which could power the planet for centuries to come.\n\nAccording to a geological survey by Geoffrey Ellis of US, the hydrogen reverse beneath the earth surface could power the earth for the next 1,000 years and reduce world\u2019s dependency on the fossil fuels.\n\nThe research further says that the earth\u2019s surface could be holding up an estimated 6.2 trillion tons of Hydrogen, which is also considered as one of the low-carbon source of energy.\n\nWhat's the challenge?\n\nThe discovery of Hydrogen reserves is not new to the world as they have already been identified in Albania and Mali.\n\nHowever, the latest research claiming on the existence of hydrogen are believed to be too deep beneath the surface, and will become a very tough challenge for its excavation.\n\nThe study further says that even just 2 per cent utilisation of this hydrogen will meet our energy demand for the next 2 centuries \u2013 200 years \u2013 and that too as a low carbon source.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, an expert from University College London has said that the extraction of hydrogen from beneath will be a huge challenge for the world and something which would require a joint effort."

            "article_content": "It took a while for scientists to gain access to the samples that NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx mission took from the asteroid Bennu, but the wait is proving to be worth it. A new study published January 29 in Nature describes an unexpected discovery in the material delivered by OSIRIS-REx: residues of compounds left over by the evaporation of liquid water.\n\nTim McCoy, the paper\u2019s lead author and the curator of meteorites at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History, tells Popular Science that the presence of these compounds was completely unexpected. \u201c[Finding them] was a complete surprise,\u201d he says. \u201cCollectively, the team that wrote this paper has hundreds of years of experience examining meteorites and none of us\u2014in fact, nobody\u2014had ever seen some of these minerals.\u201d\n\nOREX-800044-101, the sample that was analysed by the Japanese members of the OSIRIS-REx sample analysis team. Credit: Yasuhiro Oba\n\nOne of the reasons that the discovery is so significant is that the compounds must have precipitated from the evaporation of brine solutions\u2013solutions of liquid water with high concentrations of dissolved salts. \u201cWe know this,\u201d McCoy explains, \u201cboth because some of these minerals \u2026 actually have water in their crystal structure, and because we know the most abundant fluid [in the universe] is water. There could have been a small component of other ices, like carbon dioxide, but it was mostly water.\u201d\n\n[ Related: This is what\u2019s inside NASA\u2019s previously stuck asteroid sampler ]\n\nThe presence of these compounds therefore implies the presence of liquid water at some point in Bennu\u2019s history\u2014or, more accurately, in the history of the ancient asteroid from which Bennu originated. That parent asteroid was a larger object that broke up into smaller pieces at some point during the last 65 million years. McCoy explains that the parent asteroid was formed partly of ice, and over the millennia, this ice was melted by heat from the decay of radioactive elements in the asteroid\u2019s regolith.\n\nMcCoy says that this water \u201clikely existed not on the surface, but as a vein or pocket under the surface of the asteroid.\u201d This prolonged its existence in a liquid state, most likely, as McCoy says, at \u201cabout room temperature.\u201d The dissolved minerals may also have allowed the solution to remain liquid for longer: brine solutions generally have lower freezing points than pure water. (This is why roads are salted during snowy weather.)\n\nIn any case, when the water did eventually evaporate, it left behind the concentrated precipitates that proved such a surprise to McCoy and his team\u2014and when the parent asteroid broke up, those compounds were passed onto its successors, including Bennu. The first compound the team discovered in the Bennu sample was sodium carbonate, which had never been observed before in any other asteroid or meteorite. As it incorporates water into its crystal structure, its presence prompted McCoy and other teams around the world to search samples of other water-soluble compounds. They found 11 such compounds in total, all of which had been concentrated in a brine solution and then precipitated as the water evaporated.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

Brines of the sort that apparently formed in the pockets of liquid water on Bennu\u2019s ancestor provide a favorable environment for the development of complex organic compounds. In a statement accompanying the release of the paper, McCoy said, \u201cWe now know from Bennu that the raw ingredients of life were combining in really interesting and complex ways on Bennu\u2019s parent body.\u201d The paper also speculates that similar brines may exist today in the interior of Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus and Mars\u2019s moon Ceres.\n\nA mosaic image of asteroid Bennu, composed of 12 PolyCam images collected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft from a range of 24 kilometers. Credit: NASA/Goddard/University of Arizona\n\nEither way, McCoy says the apparent presence of liquid water in Bennu\u2019s parent asteroid also tells us something important about that asteroid: \u201cThe fact Bennu\u2019s parent asteroid incorporated ice means it had to form beyond the Solar System\u2019s snow line.\u201d This line marks the distance from a star at which the temperature falls below water\u2019s freezing point. (In 2016, NASA captured an image of this phenomenon in a young solar system.)\n\nThe snow line is particularly important in the early days of a solar system, as the cloud of dust and gas that surrounds a nascent star begins to coalesce into the protoplanetary disk from which the system\u2019s planets and other orbiting bodies will eventually form. Beyond the snow line, water is solid and aggregates readily into nascent planets and asteroids, whereas within the line, water remains gaseous and is harder to capture.\n\n[ Related: 10 chaotic space-related mishaps of 2024 ]\n\nThis means that objects formed beyond the snow line are relatively rich in water, and one leading theory about the origin of the water on Earth is that it was acquired by the capture of such water-rich objects. And if those objects contained brine solutions rich in organic compounds, it\u2019s at least theoretically possible that life may have already been evolving in those environments before their arrival on Earth.\n\nSuch theoretical possibilities aside, McCoy says the discovery of brine compounds shows the value of OSIRIS-REx having been able to take direct physical samples from Bennu. \u201cThese are incredibly rare minerals, so they can\u2019t be detected from Earth.\u201d In addition, he says, \u201cMany of these minerals are unstable in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Without the controlled return by a spacecraft mission and very careful curation in nitrogen to isolate them from the atmosphere, we would have never found [them] in the first place.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Google has announced new features for Gemini in Google Sheets, aimed at making data analysis easier.\n\nGemini can now generate charts, analyze trends, and answer data-related questions, even running Python code for deeper insights.\n\nThese features are rolling out now and will be available to select Google Workspace and Google One AI Premium subscribers.\n\nIf spreadsheets have ever left you squinting at rows of data or scrambling to build charts, Gemini\u2019s latest update might be a welcome relief. The company announced today that its Gemini AI assistant, already embedded in Google Workspace apps, is learning some new tricks for Google Sheets.\n\nStarting today, Gemini in Sheets can process user queries to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within spreadsheet data. This means users can ask questions about their data and receive actionable insights without needing advanced technical skills. For example, a marketing analyst could request insights into their top-performing channels, while a financial analyst could use Gemini to detect anomalies in inventory levels.\n\nAnother major addition is Gemini\u2019s ability to generate charts based on spreadsheet data. These charts, inserted as static images, provide a visual representation of key insights but do not automatically update when the data changes.\n\nGemini in Sheets can now also translate user requests into Python code, execute that code, and analyze the results. This would allow for more complex data analysis, enabling users to identify trends and drill deeper into their findings \u2014 all without needing to write a single line of Python themselves. However, for simpler queries, Gemini may still rely on spreadsheet formulas instead of Python.\n\nTo ensure the best results, Google recommends that users maintain a clean and well-structured dataset, free of missing values, with clear headers. Additionally, Sheets with more than one million cells may experience performance limitations when using Gemini for complex analysis.\n\nThe new features are rolling out starting today, with a full rollout expected by February 20. For those eager to test out the new features, Gemini in Sheets can be accessed through the side panel in Google Sheets by clicking on the \u201cAsk Gemini\u201d button in the top-right corner.\n\nHowever, not all users will have immediate access. Gemini\u2019s expanded capabilities in Sheets will be available to subscribers of Google Workspace Business Standard and Plus, Enterprise Standard and Plus, as well as users with the Gemini Education, Gemini Education Premium, or Google One AI Premium add-ons.\n\nGot a tip?

            "article_content": "[co-author: Justin Jin]\n\nWhile the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is most known for its extensive privacy compliance obligations, the law also provides for a limited private right of action for certain security-related breaches. Section 1798.150(a)(1) of the CCPA provides for a private right of action for consumers if their \u201cnonencrypted and nonredacted personal information\u201d is subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure caused by a business\u2019s failure to \u201cimplement and maintain security procedures and practices.\u201d Cal. Civ. Code. \u00a7 1798.150(a)(1). Damages available to consumers under this private right of action provision can be as high as $750 per violation. Courts can also provide consumers with injunctive or declaratory relief and \u201cany other relief the court deems proper.\u201d Cal. Civ. Code. \u00a7 1798.150(a)(1)(B) and (C).\n\nPlaintiffs have been testing this provision since the law went into effect in 2020, and 2024 was no different. In this article, we look at some notable litigation trends in cases brought under the CCPA last year. Here are our key takeaways from 2024:\n\nCourts continue to interpret \u201cunauthorized access\u201d broadly to include data intentionally disclosed to third parties by a business. Data sharing and third-party tracking cases, which previously would have fallen outside the \u00a7 1798.150 private right of action, are increasingly being brought as claims under the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The definition of \u201creasonable measures\u201d continues to emphasize Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommendations, industry best practices, and frameworks from expert organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology or other regulators such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Some defendants have secured motions to dismiss by arguing that they do not meet the definition of a \u201cbusiness\u201d under the CCPA.\n\nIn addition to the law\u2019s private right of action, companies should also be aware of CCPA enforcement by the California attorney general (California AG) and the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA). Both agencies have continued to signal their commitment to enforcing all provisions of the CCPA. The California AG\u2019s office recently settled an enforcement action, while the CPPA issued advisories on data minimization and dark patterns. It is likely that both the California AG and CPPA will significantly expand their enforcement actions under the law in the coming months.\n\nTo stay up to date on any of these developments, please subscribe to the WilmerHale Privacy and Cybersecurity Blog.\n\n2024 CCPA Litigation Trends:\n\n1. Cases broadly interpreting \u201cunauthorized access\u201d continue to be filed.\n\nThis year, two major cases involving unauthorized, non-breach disclosures of data survived motions to dismiss. Both involved online mental health platforms that disclosed user information to third-party advertisers.\n\nIn In re BetterHelp Data Disclosure Cases, 2024 WL 4219992 (N.D. Cal. Jul. 15, 2024), the court ruled that the plaintiffs, who are customers and potential customers who used BetterHelp\u2019s website, sufficiently pleaded a violation of \u00a7 1798.150(a) by alleging that BetterHelp both disclosed plaintiffs\u2019 email addresses and gave a recent college graduate \u201ccarte blanche to decide which Visitors\u2019 and Users\u2019 health information to upload.\u201d The court held that sharing the information was a \u201cdisclosure\u201d and that BetterHelp\u2019s affirmative decision to allow tracking software was not a reasonable security procedure or practice \u201cgiven the nature of the information\u201d that it collected. The court\u2019s dictum suggests that \u201cunauthorized disclosure\u201d claims may be limited only to disclosures of the most sensitive information going forward.\n\nM.G. v. Therapymatch, Inc., 2024 WL 4219992 (N.D. Cal. Sep. 16, 2024), also involved the disclosure of mental health care inquiries. Therapymatch embedded code associated with an analytics provider on its website, which collected information that users were providing to Therapymatch, including the conditions for which they were seeking treatment. Plaintiffs additionally allege that Therapymatch failed to enable a data anonymization feature offered by the provider. The court held that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged unreasonable security practices and did not need to allege a data breach, but merely needed to allege disclosure without consent.\n\nPlaintiffs have continued to file cases under this theory. Guzman v. The Western Union Co., 5:24-cv-404 (C.D. Cal.), alleges that Western Union\u2019s \u201cdragnet\u201d provision of data related to the plaintiff class\u2019s money transfers to anti-money laundering analytics groups constitutes an unauthorized disclosure. We will be keeping an eye on this and other similar cases as they progress.\n\n2. Cases under CIPA have surged.\n\nPlaintiffs alleging privacy violations due to use of third-party tracking code, such as embedded analytics or tracking pixels, are increasingly relying on CIPA rather than the CCPA. CIPA\u2019s private right of action provision was recently affirmed in Moody v. C2 Education Systems, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132614 (C.D. Cal. July 25, 2024), despite its origins as a penal statute. The right is substantially broader than that of the CCPA, requiring only that a plaintiff be \u201cinjured by a violation.\u201d Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 637.2. The statutory damages are also higher, reaching the greater of $5,000 or triple the actual damages suffered by the plaintiff. Id. In Mirmalek v. LA Times Communications LLC, 2024 WL 5102709 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2024), a court held that CCPA claims did not preempt CIPA claims, so future attempts to sue for privacy violations under the CCPA are likely to be accompanied by CIPA claims.\n\n3. Cases primarily emphasize institutional recommendations and industry best practices to define \u201creasonable security measures.\u201d\n\nThroughout the year, the array of actions (or lack thereof) that demonstrated businesses\u2019 \u201cfailure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices\u201d increasingly coalesced around a few major standards. See Cal. Civ. Code. \u00a7 1798.150(a)(1). The FTC\u2019s guidelines are among the most frequently cited standards in defining \u201creasonable security measures.\u201d For example, in In re Eureka Casino Breach Litigation, 2024 WL 4253198 (D. Nev. Sep. 19, 2024), the court ruled that Eureka\u2019s alleged failure to follow specific FTC guidelines such as requiring complex passwords and limiting access to personally identifiable information (PII) is enough to survive a motion to dismiss. The court also pointed to allegations that Eureka failed to follow institutional standards, such as the Center for Internet Security\u2019s Critical Security Control framework, as sufficient to make out a failure to apply reasonable security measures.\n\nAdditionally, a failure to apply specific industry standard measures can constitute a failure to implement reasonable security measures. For example, in In re LastPass Data Security Incident Litigation, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134178 (D. Mass. Jul. 30, 2024), the plaintiff class survived a motion to dismiss by alleging that LastPass\u2019s encryption algorithm fell below industry standards.\n\n4. Cases have been dismissed for defendants that don\u2019t meet the definition of \u201cbusiness.\u201d\n\nUnder the CCPA, a business is defined as a \u201clegal entity organized for \u2026 profit or financial benefit\u201d that not only collects personal information but also \u201cdetermines the purposes and means of the processing\u201d of that information. Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1798.140(d)(1). Where a defendant merely executes the requests of another party, it doesn\u2019t \u201cdetermine\u201d the use or processing of the data. For example, in In re Accellion, Inc. Data Breach Litigation, 713 F.Supp.3d 623 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 29, 2024), the court found that Accellion, a provider of a file hosting and sharing service, did not make determinations relating to the processing of PII. Because plaintiffs pleaded that Accellion \u201cenabled\u201d its customers in their business decisions rather than providing consulting or otherwise working with the client, it was not considered a business. By contrast, in Miller v. NextGen, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131254 (N.D. Ga. Jul. 25, 2024), the court held that allegations that NextGen used personal data to \u201cdevelop, improve, and test\u201d its services were sufficient to consider NextGen a business at the motion to dismiss stage.\n\nCertain defendants may also avoid CCPA liability based on the nature of their organization. For example, in Keown v. International Association of Sheet Metal Air Rail Transportation Workers, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168789 (D.D.C. Sep. 19, 2024), the court found that because the defendant union was a voluntary members association, and the claim didn\u2019t arise from a sale of goods, the union could not be considered a business."

Now a new study claims to have discovered a massive reserve of hydrogen beneath the earth surface which could power the planet for decades and centuries to come. The research shows that earth may be holding trillions of tons of hydrogen reserves which could power the planet for centuries to come.\n\nAccording to a geological survey by Geoffrey Ellis of US, the hydrogen reverse beneath the earth surface could power the earth for the next 1,000 years and reduce world\u2019s dependency on the fossil fuels.\n\nThe research further says that the earth\u2019s surface could be holding up an estimated 6.2 trillion tons of Hydrogen, which is also considered as one of the low-carbon source of energy.\n\nWhat's the challenge?\n\nThe discovery of Hydrogen reserves is not new to the world as they have already been identified in Albania and Mali.\n\nHowever, the latest research claiming on the existence of hydrogen are believed to be too deep beneath the surface, and will become a very tough challenge for its excavation.\n\nThe study further says that even just 2 per cent utilisation of this hydrogen will meet our energy demand for the next 2 centuries \u2013 200 years \u2013 and that too as a low carbon source.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, an expert from University College London has said that the extraction of hydrogen from beneath will be a huge challenge for the world and something which would require a joint effort."

A new study published January 29 in Nature describes an unexpected discovery in the material delivered by OSIRIS-REx: residues of compounds left over by the evaporation of liquid water.\n\nTim McCoy, the paper\u2019s lead author and the curator of meteorites at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History, tells Popular Science that the presence of these compounds was completely unexpected. \u201c[Finding them] was a complete surprise,\u201d he says. \u201cCollectively, the team that wrote this paper has hundreds of years of experience examining meteorites and none of us\u2014in fact, nobody\u2014had ever seen some of these minerals.\u201d\n\nOREX-800044-101, the sample that was analysed by the Japanese members of the OSIRIS-REx sample analysis team. Credit: Yasuhiro Oba\n\nOne of the reasons that the discovery is so significant is that the compounds must have precipitated from the evaporation of brine solutions\u2013solutions of liquid water with high concentrations of dissolved salts. \u201cWe know this,\u201d McCoy explains, \u201cboth because some of these minerals \u2026 actually have water in their crystal structure, and because we know the most abundant fluid [in the universe] is water. There could have been a small component of other ices, like carbon dioxide, but it was mostly water.\u201d\n\n[ Related: This is what\u2019s inside NASA\u2019s previously stuck asteroid sampler ]\n\nThe presence of these compounds therefore implies the presence of liquid water at some point in Bennu\u2019s history\u2014or, more accurately, in the history of the ancient asteroid from which Bennu originated. That parent asteroid was a larger object that broke up into smaller pieces at some point during the last 65 million years. McCoy explains that the parent asteroid was formed partly of ice, and over the millennia, this ice was melted by heat from the decay of radioactive elements in the asteroid\u2019s regolith.\n\nMcCoy says that this water \u201clikely existed not on the surface, but as a vein or pocket under the surface of the asteroid.\u201d This prolonged its existence in a liquid state, most likely, as McCoy says, at \u201cabout room temperature.\u201d The dissolved minerals may also have allowed the solution to remain liquid for longer: brine solutions generally have lower freezing points than pure water. (This is why roads are salted during snowy weather.)\n\nIn any case, when the water did eventually evaporate, it left behind the concentrated precipitates that proved such a surprise to McCoy and his team\u2014and when the parent asteroid broke up, those compounds were passed onto its successors, including Bennu. The first compound the team discovered in the Bennu sample was sodium carbonate, which had never been observed before in any other asteroid or meteorite. As it incorporates water into its crystal structure, its presence prompted McCoy and other teams around the world to search samples of other water-soluble compounds. They found 11 such compounds in total, all of which had been concentrated in a brine solution and then precipitated as the water evaporated.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

Brines of the sort that apparently formed in the pockets of liquid water on Bennu\u2019s ancestor provide a favorable environment for the development of complex organic compounds. In a statement accompanying the release of the paper, McCoy said, \u201cWe now know from Bennu that the raw ingredients of life were combining in really interesting and complex ways on Bennu\u2019s parent body.\u201d The paper also speculates that similar brines may exist today in the interior of Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus and Mars\u2019s moon Ceres.\n\nA mosaic image of asteroid Bennu, composed of 12 PolyCam images collected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft from a range of 24 kilometers. Credit: NASA/Goddard/University of Arizona\n\nEither way, McCoy says the apparent presence of liquid water in Bennu\u2019s parent asteroid also tells us something important about that asteroid: \u201cThe fact Bennu\u2019s parent asteroid incorporated ice means it had to form beyond the Solar System\u2019s snow line.\u201d This line marks the distance from a star at which the temperature falls below water\u2019s freezing point. (In 2016, NASA captured an image of this phenomenon in a young solar system.)\n\nThe snow line is particularly important in the early days of a solar system, as the cloud of dust and gas that surrounds a nascent star begins to coalesce into the protoplanetary disk from which the system\u2019s planets and other orbiting bodies will eventually form. Beyond the snow line, water is solid and aggregates readily into nascent planets and asteroids, whereas within the line, water remains gaseous and is harder to capture.\n\n[ Related: 10 chaotic space-related mishaps of 2024 ]\n\nThis means that objects formed beyond the snow line are relatively rich in water, and one leading theory about the origin of the water on Earth is that it was acquired by the capture of such water-rich objects. And if those objects contained brine solutions rich in organic compounds, it\u2019s at least theoretically possible that life may have already been evolving in those environments before their arrival on Earth.\n\nSuch theoretical possibilities aside, McCoy says the discovery of brine compounds shows the value of OSIRIS-REx having been able to take direct physical samples from Bennu. \u201cThese are incredibly rare minerals, so they can\u2019t be detected from Earth.\u201d In addition, he says, \u201cMany of these minerals are unstable in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Without the controlled return by a spacecraft mission and very careful curation in nitrogen to isolate them from the atmosphere, we would have never found [them] in the first place.\u201d"

The trade deficit ballooned to 2.2 per cent of GDP, exacerbated by severe restrictions on cross-border commerce, and the currency plummeted over 1,330 kyat per US dollar in 2021 to 4,520 in 2025, making imports unaffordable and sending prices soaring.\n\nThe economic situation worsened further as the country was blacklisted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for failing to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Myanmar\u2019s illicit economy is thriving and it has become the world\u2019s leading producer of opium and heroin, and one of the largest manufacturers of methamphetamines.\n\nThe jade industry, valued at billions of dollars annually, remains largely unregulated, fuelling corruption and environmental degradation. Illegal gambling, human trafficking, and scam operations have flourished along the country\u2019s porous borders.\n\nSociety in crisis\n\nMyanmar\u2019s ongoing conflict has displaced more than 3.5 million people within the country and driven many more across its borders. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) lack vital assistance and protections, and host communities are reeling under the strained resources.\n\nHunger is reaching catastrophic levels and agricultural productivity has declined by 16 per cent since 2021, largely due to conflict and climate-related disasters.\n\nFertilizer shortages, skyrocketing fuel prices, and trade disruptions have driven the price of the staple rice up by 47 per cent in some regions. The western state of Rakhine is particularly vulnerable, with food production projected to meet only 20 per cent of local needs by mid-2025, raising fears of famine-like conditions.\n\nPublic services are also severely affected, with over half of the country lacking access to electricity and hospitals out of service in conflict zones.\n\nLooming brain drain\n\nThe dire economic and security situation has led to an exodus of Myanmar\u2019s youth, with 3.7 million having migrated to Thailand by 2023. Many face exploitation and forced labour due to restrictive legal migration pathways, while those who remain are at risk of forced conscription into the military.\n\nSchool enrolment rates have also dropped significantly as access to educational facilities has been disrupted by conflict and economic hardships. In the 2023/2024 academic year, over 20 per cent of children were not attending school.\n\nCrisis or opportunity?\n\nThe outlook for Myanmar remains precarious. If current trends continue, poverty will rise further, migration will intensify and the country\u2019s fragile economy will struggle under the weight of continued conflict and international isolation, the report warns.\n\nDespite Myanmar\u2019s deepening crisis, opportunities for recovery exist.\n\nThe report highlights the resilience of local communities and the potential of civil society organizations in rebuilding social cohesion. Engaging the diaspora through education and skills development could help retain and attract talent, while expanding opportunities for women in business and employment could boost household incomes.\n\nAgricultural revitalisation, through climate-resilient crops and irrigation, is crucial for food security, while investment in environmental protection \u2013 such as reforestation and mangrove restoration \u2013 could safeguard jobs in the future."

It's a delicate balance, but one that is achievable with careful planning and robust security measures.\"\n\nKarthik is a firm believer in using data to measure success. \"I always monitor performance metrics like system latency, throughput, and resource utilization,\" he says. \"But just as important is ensuring that engineering solutions align with business KPIs. By tracking both technical and business metrics, I can optimize systems to directly contribute to business objectives.\"\n\nInnovation is at the heart of Karthik's philosophy. \"I encourage my team to experiment and continuously learn,\" he explains. \"With emerging cloud services and big data technologies, there are always new approaches to explore. It\u2019s important to foster a culture of experimentation to stay ahead of the curve.\" He credits this mindset for many of the successful solutions he\u2019s pioneered.\n\nCollaboration with cross-functional teams has played a significant role in his career. \"Working with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders is essential,\" he reflects. \"I pride myself on being able to explain complex technical concepts in a way that everyone can understand. It\u2019s about making sure that the entire team is aligned, from a technical and business perspective.\"\n\nLooking to the future, Karthik is excited about the direction of cloud computing. \"Serverless architecture, machine learning operations, and edge computing are all areas I'm particularly excited about,\" he reveals. \"The integration of AI and ML capabilities with traditional systems is a game-changer for scalability and efficiency.\"\n\nAs Karthik continues to innovate and lead in the tech space, he also sees a growing emphasis on sustainable computing. \"There\u2019s a rising awareness about the environmental impact of technology,\" he says. \"Efficient system design can reduce carbon footprints, and I\u2019m proud to contribute to that movement.\"\n\nWith his unique blend of technical expertise and leadership, Karthik Venkatesan is shaping the future of software engineering, ensuring that it remains both cutting-edge and responsible."

            "article_content": "Warning: This article contains discussion of sexual assault which some readers may find distressing\n\nThe alleged former assistant of Sean 'Diddy' Combs has spoken out about the rapper following his arrest on charges of racketeering and sexual trafficking.\n\nThe assistant, named Phil Pines, broke his silence as part of a newly released documentary called The Fall of Diddy, which has been viewed by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAdvert\n\nLast year, the disgraced rapper was charged with racketeering, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has since denied the charges and pleaded not guilty.\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs was arrested on multiple charges last year (NBC via Getty Images)\n\nDiddy\u2019s Miami mansion was raided last year, with the unsettling discovery being made of large amounts of baby oil, lubricant, guns, and ammunition.\n\nThe lubricant and baby oil are thought to be linked to allegedly violent and drug-fuelled sex parties known as 'freak offs'.\n\nAdvert\n\nPines came forward and spoke about these parties which Combs would have him arrange for a 'laundry list' of paraphernalia.\n\nPines worked for the rapper and mogul from 2019 to 2021, and said he never personally attended the 'freak off' parties.\n\nThe former assistant did say, however, that other parties called Wild King Nights events would lead to him arranging the list of items Diddy required.\n\nPhil Pines opened up about working for the rapper in a new interview (Investigation Discovery)\n\nAdvert\n\nIn the interview, conducted by Investigation Discovery, he said: \"We usually had a laundry list of items that included lights, alcohol, marijuana, ketamine, Molly.\n\n\"You have mushrooms on the top there \u2026 baby oil and astroglide [lubricant] are very important; candles, incense, Apple TVs, electronics, computers, iPads. Obviously there was, you know, male libido supplements, stuff like that.\"\n\nPines added that 'young' girls would often attend these parties, describing them as women in their 20s. Diddy is 55.\n\nHe said: \"A lot of times, there were girls that were under the radar, didn\u2019t have a lot of influence. I think that speaks to the type of situations people were put in.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"A lot of times, you have [Diddy] with a young female, and there\u2019s a power dynamic there.\n\nDiddy awaits trial in Brooklyn, New York (Sharief Ziyadat via Getty Images)\n\n\"A more impressionable girl is easier to reel in, as opposed to somebody who might be a celebrity who\u2019s not going to do too much of that, or give some pushback.\"\n\nIn another portion of the interview, Pines was emotional as he described how the rapper 'ordered' him to have sex with a girl to 'prove his loyalty'.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe claims that Diddy said to him: \"Prove your loyalty to me, King.\"\n\nThe rapper then began massaging his shoulders like a coach to a 'player that's about to enter the game', handed him a condom, and 'pushed' Pines onto the girl on the couch.\n\nHe went on to add: \"In the moment it felt like, 'What, is this fun for him? Is this a test for entertainment, does he know he's doing this? Is he that gone?' I didn't know what to do.\"\n\nHarrowing allegations have come out about the rapper and his 'freak off' parties (Samir Hussein via Getty Images)\n\nPines said the woman consented to the sex and 'performed' until Diddy was out of sight, at which point he ran away.\n\nHe claimed that he had 'never really recovered from' the incident.\n\nCombs currently awaits trial in Brooklyn, New York, and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article and wish to speak to someone in confidence, contact The Survivors Trust for free on 08088 010 818, available 10am-12.30pm, 1.30pm-3pm and 6pm-8pm Monday to Thursday, 10am-12.30pm and 1.30pm-3pm on Fridays, 10am-12.30pm on Saturdays and 6pm-8pm on Sundays."

I'll never forget that sight as long as I live,\" Ogden added.\n\nAsked whether he feared death while he was hanging out of the cockpit, Lancaster told reporters: \"It did cross my mind. For a moment or two.\"\n\nIn the 2005 documentary Mayday, he also explained: \"What I remember most clearly was the fact that I couldn't breathe because I was facing into the airflow.\"\n\nAn investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) later found that bolts belonging to the windshield had been replaced with slightly smaller ones, which proved to be a lot less secure.\n\nLancaster returned to work after less than five months, but left British Airways in 2003.\n\nHe went on to fly planes for EasyJet until 2008, when he retired from commercial piloting - as I'm sure he'd seen more than enough of the skies by that point."

NOW TO THAT OVERNIGHT MYSTERY IN THE SKY. MANY OF YOU SENT US VIDEOS AND CALLED INTO OUR NEWSROOM AROUND 9:00 LAST NIGHT. AFTER SEEING THIS STREAKS OF LIGHT IN THE NIGHT SKY. PEOPLE REPORTED SEEING THIS FROM KENOSHA ALL THE WAY UP TO NORTHERN OZAUKEE COUNTY. 12 NEWS MALLORY ANDERSON JOINS US LIVE NOW FROM THE MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MUSEUM, PLANETARIUM AND MALLORY THE PLANETARIUM DIRECTOR THERE SAYS HE BELIEVES THAT IT\u2019S SPACE JUNK. RIGHT? GERRON. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT OUR IN-HOUSE EXPERTS ARE. METEOROLOGIST ALSO BELIEVED WAS STREAKING DOWN FROM THE SKY. SO SPACE JUNK IS ESSENTIALLY ANYTHING THAT\u2019S MANMADE OR SIMILAR THAT WAS THEN HIT BY SOMETHING OR BREAKS UP IN THE EARTH\u2019S ATMOSPHERE. AS YOU MENTIONED, SO MANY PEOPLE WERE TAKEN OFF GUARD WHEN THEY SPOTTED THE LIGHTS UP IN THE IN THE SKY LAST NIGHT. IT WASN\u2019T JUST OVER WISCONSIN, BUT IT DOES APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN A REGIONAL PHENOMENON. SOME REPORTS COMING IN FROM ILLINOIS AND MICHIGAN AS WELL. BOB BONDER, THE PLANETARIUM DIRECTOR, SAYS THERE ARE OVER 10,000 SATELLITES ABOVE EARTH AT ANY GIVEN TIME, AND THEY GET BROKEN UP LIKE THIS IN A FEW WAYS, INCLUDING BEING HIT BY A METEOR OR COMING INTO CONTACT WITH SOME OTHER SPACE BOUND ITEM. SPACE JUNK IS DEBRIS FROM SATELLITES THAT CAME OFF OR PART OF A SATELLITE, AND IT FALLS TO THE EARTH. IT LOSES ITS MOMENTUM, ITS SPEED DUE TO FRICTION, AND THEN IT WILL FALL TO THE EARTH. AND IT\u2019S JUST RUBBING AGAINST THE ATMOSPHERE AT ABOUT 20 MILES A SECOND. SO I THINK IF YOU KNOW, THAT\u2019S WE RUB OUR HANDS, RIGHT, OR WAVE REAL FAST, 20 MILES A SECOND IS CRAZY FAST. AND SO IT\u2019S BURNING UP WITH THE FRICTION. SO MALLORY, THE PLANETARIUM DIRECTOR, SAYS THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. THAT\u2019S TRUE. GERRON. SO THIS HAPPENS PROBABLY MORE COMMONLY THAN YOU THINK. NASA PREDICTS THAT THERE\u2019S ABOUT ONE PIECE OF SPACE DEBRIS THAT\u2019S BROKEN UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE. EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT REALLY DISINTEGRATES BEFORE IT EVEN HITS EARTH. SO IT\u2019S NOT CAUSING ANY ISSUES IN PEOPLE\u2019S BACKYARDS. AS FOR THE THEORY THAT THIS COULD BE ALIENS, BOB SAYS THAT\u2019S NOT LIKELY BECAUSE THIS WOULD DEFINITELY BE THE BIGGEST STORY IN THE WORLD THIS MORNING. IF THERE WAS ANY CONCERN ABOUT THAT. IT\u2019S A BIG STORY, BUT. I AGREE NOT NOT AS BIG AS ALIENS IN THE SKY, RIGHT? THANK YOU FOR CLEARING IT ALL UP FOR US. MALLORY ANDERSON LIVE AT THE MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MUSEUM. LET\u2019S GO AHEAD AND BRING IN METEOROLOGIST LINDSEY SLATER NOW. LINDSEY SPACE JUNK. AND AS WE JUST HEARD THERE, IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. BUT REALLY SUCH A COOL SIGHT FOR SO MANY PEOPLE LAST NIGHT. OH YEAH. AND YOU KNOW, THE WAY YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPACE JUNK AND LIKE STARLINK, STARLINK IN THE ATMOSPHERE IS LIKE ONE STRAIGHT LINE, VERY BRIGHT, USUALLY A WHITE COLOR. AND IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE LITTLE BRAILLE OR SPECKLES UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE. AND IT DOESN\u2019T REALLY APPEAR TO HAVE A LOT OF MOVEMENT. BUT THIS CLEARLY IS THAT SPACE JUNK. YOU SEE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THAT DEBRIS, AND I\u2019M JUST POINTING IT OUT FOR YOU. AND JUST LIKE MALLORY SAID, LIKELY PIECES OF A SATELLITE, OR YOU CAN GET LIKE CHIPS OF PAINT OR DIFFERENT THINGS COMING OFF THAT SATELLITE. AND I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, THIS IS SUPER, SUPER COMMON. IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHERE IT\u2019S FALLING. THERE IS SO MUCH IN THE LOWER ORBIT OF EARTH\u2019S ATMOSPHERE THAT THIS STUFF HAPPENS ALL THE TIME."
