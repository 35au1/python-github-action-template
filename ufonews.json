            "article_content": "Studio Pierrot doomed Black Clover anime with its questionable choices and the series could have fared better at the hands of Ufotable.\n\nBlack Clover, the popular manga by Yuki Tabata, was picked up by Studio Pierrot for an anime adaptation in 2017. Since then, the series has amassed many fans but also a boatload of criticism, which mainly stems from Pierrot\u2019s treatment of the anime. This often makes fans wonder if an entirely different studio would have treated the series better.\n\nStudio Pierrot might be behind long-running series like Bleach and Naruto, but their animation of Black Clover was nowhere near the top shots. Studio Ufotable, on the other hand, took Demon Slayer and animated it to perfection with enough time and energy. And the sales numbers of the series speak volumes about the result.\n\nStudio Pierrot damned Black Clover by giving it the 2000s treatment\n\nBlack Clover | Credits: Studio Pierrot \u26f6 Black Clover | Credits: Studio Pierrot \u26f6 Black Clover | Credits: Studio Pierrot \u26f6 Black Clover | Credits: Studio Pierrot \u26f6\n\n\u00d7\n\nStudio Pierrot is known for animating long-running anime like Naruto, Bleach, Yu Yu Hakusho, and others. These series have weekly episode releases and not seasonal anime which is more prevalent during current times. While this approach worked in the 1990s or early 2000s anime, it is an obsolete system in the current anime era.\n\nAs a result, the Black Clover anime has sub-par animation at times, coupled with pacing issues. Studio Pierrot has several anime under them, which caused Black Clover to get the short end of the stick. The tight schedule, lack of time to develop better quality, lack of resources and less staff have definitely left an impact on the series.\n\nThe anime has considerably bad animation at times, with characters often missing characteristic features. Bad-quality fillers were included just to delay the anime from catching up to the manga, which in turn invited criticism. The tight deadlines tempted the studio to outsource the animation, and overall, Black Clover just deserved better. It is these concerns that lead fans to believe that the anime might have turned out much better had another studio taken over.\n\nStudio Pierrot\u2019s views were changed due to Ufotable\u2019s Demon Slayer\n\nDemon Slayer Sanemi vs Muichiro | Credit: Ufotable\n\nDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is an anime that changed the anime industry forever. The president of Studio Pierrot, Michiyuki Honma, himself admitted that the series was a major turning point for the industry. Honma realized that Demon Slayer was a high-quality work that took a lot of time as well as a generous budget to produce. Of course, the efforts were not wasted as the anime is currently one of the most popular anticipated series.\n\nMost studios have already shifted to seasonal anime releases, ditching the ages-old weekly episode schedule. The result is high-quality anime that is appreciated by the masses. Thus, the president confirmed that the studio is currently looking to create more anime that won\u2019t follow their old format.\n\nThis is good news for every weekly anime under Pierrot like Black Clover and Boruto. The introduction of the seasonal format would make sure that staff members won\u2019t be overworked and there won\u2019t be too many productions at a time. Having seasonal releases will also give plenty of time for the manga to progress, resulting in fewer filler episodes.\n\nBlack Clover manga is available to read on Viz Media, and the anime is currently streaming on Crunchyroll."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence continues to revolutionize health care, and vision care stands at the forefront of this technological transformation. Modern AI applications offer new possibilities for detecting, monitoring, and treating various eye conditions. These innovations make eye care more accessible and efficient while improving diagnostic accuracy.\n\n1. Early detection of eye conditions\n\nAI-powered screening tools now detect early signs of common eye conditions before they become serious problems. Using advanced image recognition technology, these systems analyze retinal scans and other eye imaging with remarkable precision.\n\nThese tools particularly excel at identifying conditions like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration during routine screenings. Early detection allows for prompt intervention, often preventing or minimizing vision loss that might otherwise occur.\n\n2. Personalized vision correction\n\nAI algorithms now help create highly personalized vision correction solutions. By analyzing multiple data points about an individual\u2019s eye structure, visual habits, and lifestyle factors, AI systems recommend more precise prescriptions for glasses and contact lenses.\n\nThese personalized approaches consider factors like digital device usage, work environment, and daily activities to optimize vision correction for specific needs. This results in better visual comfort and reduced eye strain throughout the day.\n\n3. Real-time vision assistance\n\nAI-powered applications and devices provide real-time assistance for people with visual impairments. These tools can describe surroundings, read text aloud, and identify objects or faces, significantly improving daily independence for those with vision challenges.\n\nAdvanced computer vision algorithms help these assistive technologies become more accurate and responsive over time, learning from user interactions to provide better support. This technology particularly benefits those with progressive vision conditions.\n\n4. Treatment monitoring and adjustment\n\nAI systems excel at monitoring treatment progress and suggesting adjustments to eye care plans. These tools track changes in vision over time, helping eye care professionals make more informed decisions about treatment modifications.\n\nThe technology analyzes patterns in vision changes, medication responses, and lifestyle factors to optimize treatment strategies. This data-driven approach leads to better outcomes and more efficient use of treatment resources.\n\n5. Digital eye strain prevention\n\nAs digital device usage increases, AI applications help prevent and manage digital eye strain. Smart systems monitor screen time, viewing distances, and environmental factors to provide personalized recommendations for maintaining eye health.\n\nThese applications can adjust screen brightness and contrast, remind users to take breaks, and suggest optimal viewing positions based on individual habits and needs. This proactive approach helps preserve vision health in our increasingly digital world.\n\nThe role of data in vision care\n\nAI systems continually learn from vast amounts of eye health data, improving their ability to detect patterns and predict potential issues. This growing knowledge base enhances the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment recommendations.\n\nPrivacy-protected data sharing between eye care providers helps these systems become more sophisticated, leading to better understanding of various eye conditions and more effective treatment approaches.\n\nIntegration with traditional eye care\n\nAI technology works alongside traditional eye care practices, enhancing rather than replacing the expertise of eye care professionals. This collaboration leads to more comprehensive care delivery and better patient outcomes.\n\nEye care professionals use AI insights to make more informed decisions while maintaining the critical human element in vision care. This balanced approach ensures optimal results for patients.\n\nAccessibility and affordability\n\nAI-powered solutions often make vision care more accessible to underserved populations. Remote screening and monitoring capabilities help reach people who might otherwise lack access to regular eye care.\n\nThese technologies can reduce the cost of certain eye care services, making regular vision monitoring more affordable for many individuals. This increased accessibility helps prevent vision problems through earlier intervention.\n\nFuture developments\n\nOngoing research continues to unveil new applications for AI in vision care. Emerging technologies promise even more precise diagnostic tools and treatment options, potentially revolutionizing how we approach eye health.\n\nThese developments include advanced imaging techniques, more sophisticated prediction models, and innovative treatment approaches that could significantly impact vision care outcomes.\n\nThe importance of regular monitoring\n\nWhile AI provides powerful tools for vision care, regular professional eye examinations remain essential. These technologies work best as part of a comprehensive eye care strategy that includes routine professional oversight.\n\nRegular monitoring helps track changes in vision health and ensures that AI-powered solutions continue to meet individual needs effectively.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAs AI technology continues to evolve, its applications in vision care will likely expand further. This ongoing development promises even more effective tools for maintaining and improving eye health.\n\nUnderstanding these technological advances helps individuals make informed decisions about incorporating AI-powered solutions into their vision care routine while maintaining appropriate professional oversight for optimal results."

            "article_content": "Dandadan, Dandadan, Dandadan, Dandadan, Dandadan. Even before it got its anime adaptation, the title of one of this year\u2019s best shows feels like it was destined to be turned into rhythm. Thank god the Japanese band behind the anime\u2019s catchy and propulsive opening had the same idea, one that\u2019s compelled over 32 million views and counting on YouTube alone (and that\u2019s just one of its listings \u2013 there\u2019s another on Netflix\u2019s channel). The bouncy, fast-paced backing track already feels perfectly representative of this animated take on the manga by Yukinobu Tatsu, in a goofy, chaotic and idiosyncratic genre mash-up.\n\nThe show itself, directed by F\u016bga Yamashiro with animation produced by Science Saru, is similarly flexible. A marriage of science fiction and horror, reflections on contemporary urban living and age-old folklore, high school romance and hard-hitting action, there\u2019s a little bit of something for everybody. \"Dandadan\" is the story of Momo Ayase and Ken \u201cOkarun\u201d Takakura, two seemingly opposite classmates at school who are drawn together by a mutual fascination with the paranormal. Momo insists that ghosts and spirits are real, while Ken (whom Momo later nicknames Okarun) believes in aliens.\n\nNeither believe the other at first, before each land themselves into an encounter with those very things. Momo is abducted by aliens, Okarun is possessed by Turbo Granny, a spirit haunting a tunnel (and yes, Turbo Granny is the actual name of a spirit from Japanese urban legend). Both survive the experience, but gain strange new powers as a result, and use those to solve various hauntings and other abductions throughout this 12-episode run (with more to come next year). Not only that, but the two have to begin a search: during his possession by Turbo Granny, Okarun\u2019s balls got stolen.\n\nTurbo Granny in \"Dandadan\" (Yukinobu Tatsu/Shueisha, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\nAs well as the general mayhem that emerges it\u2019s fun seeing how each episode of \"Dandadan\" highlights its different building blocks: One episode might be more ghostly, the next leaning more into sci-fi, with some surprisingly long stretches dedicated to fleshing out the budding romance between Momo and Okarun. In action-oriented anime, romance is usually an afterthought, but in \"Dandadan\" it's one of the driving forces of the story \u2013 including arcs about communication and anxiety that are surprisingly sincere and generous about these feelings, while giving a lot of space for characters to figure out some tangled emotions.\n\nRelated The 12 biggest moments in animation in 2023\n\nIt\u2019s the balancing act to the rest of the show\u2019s sometimes willfully juvenile humor, which actually never tips into insufferable, just silly (though this is perhaps underselling how deranged the first couple of episodes are). The show has been a standout this year in part because of its sense of unpredictability as well as its sincere investment in its romance, and its eye-catching visual approach, which is perhaps not as experimental as the studio\u2019s other work has been (though one standout episode has an astonishing first person conceit), but it\u2019s consistently beautiful.\n\nThose \"Dandadan\" main titles\n\nDirected by Abel Gongora of \"Scott Pilgrim Takes Off\" fame, the viral opening credits encompass all of these sides to the show. The backing song \u2013 performed by a band called Creepy Nuts, oddly appropriate for this \u2013 first kicks things off with wild and energetic rapping before settling into a gentler, poppy hook, almost reflective of the tonal swings in the show that follows. It\u2019s also just an earworm, perhaps even surpassing Gongora\u2019s last efforts as director on the opening for Science Saru\u2019s \"Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!!\" which also went viral in its day.\n\nAll this and having style to spare, it\u2019s also just fun.\n\nThe animation itself complements these change-ups beautifully \u2013 shifting art styles as it moves from the quickfire montage of detailed, goofy expressions hinting at the main cast\u2019s personalities to the more heavily stylized touches, as the camera zooms out until the person in frame becomes a shape amidst a block color background. Interspersed throughout are some paintings of the various spirits and aliens, silhouetted against the block colors which within the show itself become strongly associated with them: each spiritual or alien encounter leading to the following scenes being taken over by that single block color. It\u2019s not just a hint at the show\u2019s own style, but a reference to its influences; many have noted that much of the opening refers back to that of the original \"Ultraman,\" the monsters from which have inspired a lot of those in \"Dandadan.\" This wild minute-and-a-half eventually settles into a hint at something more tender as the two main characters lean on each other and look at the stars.\n\nMomo in \"Dandadan\" (Yukinobu Tatsu/Shueisha, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\nAll this and having style to spare, it\u2019s also just fun. There\u2019s giant crabs, guys running so fast they turn into a mess of jagged lines, there\u2019s a maneki-neko doll running around, there\u2019s dancing (modeled on moves from a Rihanna video, as pointed out by some eagle-eyed fans).\n\nIt speaks to something which has felt missing from a lot of television in recent years, as so many opening sequences have gotten tied up in feeling prestigious, leading down the same road of moody and atmospheric music over a montage of animated statues. Even the animated smash hit \"Arcane,\" which is more eclectic than even \"Dandadan\" in its visual approach, fell into this same trap as it relented to these prestige TV trends.\n\n\"Dandadan\u2019s\" opening, for all the influences it proudly presents, doesn\u2019t feel so anonymous. It has personality and energy, no anxiety about not being taken seriously. Admittedly, though on average they trend to being more, well, animated than a lot of TV main titles, anime opening and ending credits tend to follow their own medium's tropes. Think images of hands reaching out the sun, the protagonist running . . . somewhere, the cast falling out of the sky. You can get generic versions of these too; there\u2019s no ironclad rule, and Gongora\u2019s work on \"Dandadan\" (and \"Eizouken\") feel idiosyncratic within that space too.\n\nWhy not have an opening that encourages you to sing the title?\n\nStill, they\u2019re at the pinnacle of a format which can sometimes feel like an afterthought, as television gets absorbed more and more into an age of \u201cSkip Intro\u201d buttons and streamers attempting to push you through to the next episode as soon as possible. It should be said that there are notable recent exceptions: think \"Peacemaker,\" \"Pachinko\" (I promise, I\u2019m not just naming intros with dance routines), \"Severance\" or \"Succession\" (there you go). These are shows with different priorities, yes, and anime like \"Dandadan\" is looking toward pop sensibilities rather than HBO\u2019s \u201cit\u2019s not TV\u201d mindset, something many treat as aspirational. But openings like this (and like \"Peacemaker\") are part of the fun, a chance to capture the show in microcosm, and chasing trends feels like it diminishes that chance.\n\nPerhaps this is all part of my wider problem with streaming, the expectation to get everything at once, ravenously consume it, and click to the next thing, rather than have fun with the ritual of television, of seeing something on a weekly basis and growing familiar with it. I can\u2019t get \"Dandadan\" out of my head, so I\u2019ll be coming back. Why not have an opening that encourages you to sing the title?"

            "article_content": "In September, 2011, I drove to Plains, Georgia, with Gerald Rafshoon, President Jimmy Carter\u2019s former media adviser. Rafshoon had asked me to write a play about the 1978 Camp David summit between Carter, President Anwar Sadat, of Egypt, and Menachem Begin, the Israeli Prime Minister. They were three pious men. Sadat called himself \u201cthe first man of Islam.\u201d He plotted against the British and was charged with complicity in an assassination of a pro-British minister, and had come to the Presidency only through the death of the charismatic leader of the Arab world, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Begin was an Orthodox Jew\u2014the first non-secular leader of Israel and the founder of the Likud Party\u2014and had lost his parents in the Holocaust. He had also been the head of a terrorist organization, the Irgun, and was responsible for the deaths of more than ninety people in the bombing of the King David Hotel, in Jerusalem, in 1946. Carter, an evangelical Christian, had had little prior political experience other than a single term as the governor of Georgia. These men spent thirteen days secluded near Maryland\u2019s Catoctin Mountain and produced a peace treaty that has endured for forty years. It was Jimmy Carter\u2019s signature accomplishment and one that has never been matched in the region, despite decades of strenuous attempts.\n\nThe Carters lived in a ranch house on the edge of town. We met in the front room, where Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, sat on a couch upholstered in a blue print that matched the curtains. Behind them was a painting that Carter had made of the same room, with its grandfather clock, rocking chairs, and roll-top desk. It looked like an illustration from the children\u2019s book \u201cGoodnight Moon.\u201d Not depicted were two matching elliptical machines that faced the television. Carter was eighty-six at the time. He wore khaki pants, short athletic socks, and a blue shirt that almost disappeared against the couch. His silver belt buckle was a horseshoe enclosing the initials J.C. He had not shaved, and his white stubble made his face more wintry than usual. I was just beginning my research, and I didn\u2019t yet know who the characters in the play should be, beyond Carter, Sadat, and Begin.\n\nRafshoon introduced me by saying that I had recently published an article in The New Yorker about Scientology. \u201cOh, I read that,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI found it most intriguing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when did you start reading The New Yorker?\u201d Rosalynn asked.\n\n\u201cI read it every week!\u201d he protested.\n\nRosalynn rolled her eyes. It was as if she had leapt onstage. Dramatically, I needed someone who could talk to Carter with the unvarnished candor and the unsparing insight that comes from a lifetime spent together. Rosalynn was born in Plains, and her family lived next door to the house where the Carter family then lived, though she and Jimmy didn\u2019t become romantically involved until 1945, when he came home for the summer from the United States Naval Academy, in Annapolis. After their first date, he told his mother that he was going to marry Rosalynn. They were wed the following year, after his graduation. He was twenty-one and she was eighteen.\n\nCarter owned a stand of pines, which were being harvested, so we rode out in a Secret Service Tahoe to watch the trees being cut, trimmed, and loaded onto a flatbed truck. The agent driving the car was new and unfamiliar with the back roads. Carter was testy and snapped at him when he missed a turn. I felt sympathy for the agent, who had signed up to protect his country and found himself driving down on a dirt road, answering to an impatient old man who had once been the most powerful figure in the world and had since become the closest approximation in public life to an American saint. Along the way, Carter gave us a drive-by tour of his childhood home, which is now a historic site, the Jimmy Carter Boyhood Farm, in the small community of Archery, three miles west of Plains, where his family moved when he was four. \u201cThis is where I learned blacksmithing. This is the barn where I used to corral mules,\u201d he said, not bothering to get out of the car. There was a dirt tennis court that his father had built. \u201cI could beat every kid in town, but I never beat my father,\u201d Carter told us.\n\nThe Carters were the only white family in Archery, and his playmates were the children of Black tenant farmers. The lessons he drew from his background in southern Georgia would define his political career. He lost his first run for governor, in 1966, to Lester Maddox, one of the most racist figures in modern Georgia history. That defeat sent him into a spiritual crisis, and he later credited his experience of being \u201cborn again\u201d for getting him through this bleak period. In his gubernatorial inaugural address, in 1971, Carter said, \u201cI say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over.\u201d In the South at that time, the declaration was a landmark, and it got him on the cover of Time magazine.\n\nCarter made a point of showing me the family cemetery\u2014a dirt patch surrounded by a hurricane fence. His people had been in the area since the early nineteenth century, and the tombstones were worn and covered in lichen. He was clearly proud of how tidy the ground was, having cleared it himself, nearly stepping on a rattlesnake in the process.\n\nWe passed a deserted farmhouse that Carter said was haunted. \u201cBy what?\u201d I asked. \u201cHaints,\u201d Carter said, using an old Southern term for ghosts. He said that, as a boy, when he was working in town or staying late at school after dark, he was terrified of walking past the house. Several times, he thought he saw a haint in the window, \u201ca woman with a lamp.\u201d There was a legend that a woman who once lived there kept her daughter in the attic, he told me. \u201cMaybe that was her.\u201d\n\nWhen we got back to the house, the Carters decided that we should all go into town for dinner\u2014i.e., lunch\u2014at Mom\u2019s Kitchen. The Carters rode in the Tahoe, and Rafshoon and I drove with Mary Prince, an African American woman who had worked for the Carters for decades. Prince had been convicted of murder following the shooting of a man outside a bar in Lumpkin, Georgia, in 1970. When the Carters lived in the Governor\u2019s Mansion, she was assigned there as a trusty prisoner, and worked as a nanny to their daughter, Amy. During Carter\u2019s Presidency, he arranged to be designated as Prince\u2019s parole officer, so that she could work in the White House. She was eventually declared innocent of the murder and was granted a full pardon.\n\nMom\u2019s turned out to be an all-you-can-eat buffet serving fried chicken, meat loaf, and collard greens. We talked a bit about politics and the 2012 election. Carter had his differences with President Barack Obama but thought that he would be re\u00eblected. Rick Perry, then the governor of Texas, had just jumped into the race as an early favorite. Carter thought he had no chance of winning, but, if he did, \u201cit may be a disaster for the Republican Party.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d Rosalynn observed, \u201cwe thought the same about Reagan.\u201d\n\nI was still intrigued by Carter\u2019s paranormal experiences, so I asked him about a time in the nineteen-sixties when he said he saw a U.F.O. He was the head of several Lions Clubs in Georgia, and had gone to make a speech at a club in another town. \u201cThere were about twenty-five other men standing outside,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThere was a light over the trees, at first no bigger than a star, then like a moon, then it hovered over the trees. It was big and round. Then it moved away.\u201d\n\nI said that I had once seen something similar, while driving through Alabama. An astronomer friend had said it was a \u201cnoctilucent cloud,\u201d a mysterious phenomenon which, at the time, was common enough to have acquired a name but still defied understanding. It was shaped like a perfect globe and appeared solid, like a hovering moon, until it slowly dissolved.\n\n\u201cSomething else strange did happen, while I was President,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe had a plane go down in Zaire with some important documents. We searched for it. We adjusted our satellites to comb through the area, without success. Finally, my director of intelligence, Stansfield Turner, said he knew of a psychic in California. Apparently, he spoke to her, and she wrote down some co\u00f6rdinates. And we programmed that into the satellite, and, the next time it passed over, there was the plane.\u201d \u201cThat tells me a lot about the intelligence community,\u201d I said. \u201cIndeed,\u201d Carter said. \u201cOne of our few successes.\u201d\n\nIn 1973, when Carter was still governor, he and Rosalynn journeyed to Israel. It was both a spiritual and a political pilgrimage. Golda Meir was the Prime Minister, and, as a courtesy, she accorded the Georgia governor and his wife an old Mercedes and a driver to ferry them around the Holy Land. The trip to Israel fortified Carter\u2019s international portfolio and awarded him credibility among American Jews, a critical Democratic constituency for the improbable race that he was considering. The Carters also visited several Jewish settlements on the West Bank, which he concluded posed a significant obstacle to peace. He was profoundly moved by Israel\u2019s struggle, and on his first day in the Oval Office, in January, 1977, he stunned his Vice-President, Walter Mondale, by saying that his first priority was to bring peace to the Middle East. Carter later told me that he believed God had put him into the Presidency for that very reason."

And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

            "article_content": "By Melissa Tribelhorn\n\nCEO/Executive Director, NWABR\n\nAs the Executive Director of the Northwest Association for Biomedical Research (NWABR), I have the privilege of working at the intersection of scientific discovery, ethics, and public trust. In the Pacific Northwest, we are home to some of the world\u2019s most cutting-edge research institutions, where innovation and ethical responsibility go hand in hand. Nowhere is this more evident than in the burgeoning field of AI-driven tools in healthcare and biomedical research.\n\nWe recently hosted a panel on science and innovation. The October 7, 2024, NWABR event focused on addressing clinical research and the path to drug discovery. This pivotal half-day session of panel dialogues was designed to educate the public, policymakers, and key stakeholders about the essential support required to sustain the biomedical research community.\n\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force in healthcare, accelerating drug discovery, improving diagnostics, and creating new pathways for personalized medicine. But as with any groundbreaking technology, it brings with it a host of ethical questions and challenges. How do we ensure that AI is used responsibly, transparently, and in a way that promotes health equity? How can we guarantee that the benefits of AI reach all patients, not just those with the most access to advanced care?\n\nAt NWABR, we see AI not only as a tool for advancing the science of discovery but also as a catalyst for fostering greater public trust in biomedical research. The Pacific Northwest\u2019s research community was built on a foundation of integrity, transparency, and a deep commitment to ethical research. As AI reshapes the landscape of medicine, we remain committed to upholding these values, ensuring that this technology is developed and used in ways that prioritize patient welfare and public trust.\n\nBuilding Trust Through Ethical AI\n\nOne of the most critical questions surrounding AI in healthcare is: how do we ensure the technology works for everyone? AI models often rely on vast amounts of data to make predictions, but without diverse, representative datasets, these models can inadvertently reinforce existing health disparities. For AI to truly drive health equity, it must be trained on data that reflects the diversity of the populations it serves. This is a key point of emphasis in our work at NWABR, where we promote ethical standards that demand inclusivity in research practices.\n\nWhen AI tools are used for diagnostics, such as detecting early signs of diseases like cancer or diabetic retinopathy, we must ensure they are accurate across all demographic groups. A model that works well for one population but fails for another does not serve the core mission of improving public health. It is essential that AI is developed with transparency and a commitment to addressing potential biases.\n\nCollaboration: A Key to Ethical Innovation\n\nTo navigate these challenges, NWABR fosters collaboration between researchers, healthcare providers, and community stakeholders. We believe that by working together, we can create AI solutions that are both innovative and equitable. This collaboration extends beyond the scientific community to include patients and the public, whose voices are crucial in shaping the ethical use of new technologies.\n\nAt NWABR, we are dedicated to educating the public about the ethical use of AI in healthcare. Through open dialogue, we strive to demystify the technology and build a shared understanding of its potential\u2014and its limitations.

            "article_content": "Scientists described numerous new species this past year, the world\u2019s smallest otter in India, a fanged hedgehog from Southeast Asia, tree-dwelling frogs in Madagascar, and a new family of African plants.\n\nExperts estimate that fewer than 20% of Earth\u2019s species have been documented by Western science, with potentially millions more awaiting discovery.\n\nAlthough species may be new to science, many are already known to local and Indigenous peoples and have traditional names and uses.\n\nUpon discovery, many new species are assessed as threatened with extinction, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts. See All Key Ideas\n\nA giant anaconda, a vampire hedgehog, a dwarf squirrel, and a tiger cat were among the new species named by science in 2024. Found from the depths of the Pacific Ocean to the mountaintops of Southeast Asia, each new species shows us that even our well-known world contains unexplored chambers of life.\n\nThis year, in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo Landscape alone, scientists uncovered 27 new-to-science species, including four new mammals, during a two month expedition. Meanwhile, the Greater Mekong region yielded 234 new species, and scientists from the California Academy of Sciences described 138 new species globally. The ocean depths continued to surprise, with more than 100 potentially new species found on an unexplored underwater mountain off Chile\u2019s coast. Two new mammal species were found in India this year, including the world\u2019s smallest otter.\n\nScientists estimate only a small fraction of Earth\u2019s species have been documented, perhaps 20% at best. Even among mammals, the best-known group of animals, researchers think we\u2019ve only found 80% of species. Most of these hidden species are likely bats, rodents, shrews, moles and hedgehogs.\n\nHowever, while species may be new to Western science, many have been well known to Indigenous peoples and local communities for generations. These communities often maintain sophisticated classification systems and deep ecological knowledge about species\u2019 behaviors, uses and roles in local ecosystems.\n\n\u201cFor example, the blob-headed fish, which is so bizarre and unusual, and scientists have never seen anything like it, but it\u2019s very familiar to the Awaj\u00fan,\u201d Trond Larsen, the leader of the Alto Mayo expedition in Peru from the NGO Conservation International, told Mongabay. \u201cThey regularly catch and eat them.\u201d Similarly, the ghost palm, newly named by scientists this year, has been used by Iban communities in Borneo for basketry and food for decades.\n\nUnfortunately, many species may be threatened with extinction before they\u2019re even formally named, victims of human activities like development and climate change. Some of these species could be foods or medicines for humans, but each has a unique role in Earth\u2019s interconnected web of life.\n\n\u201cThere is something immensely unethical and troubling about humans driving species extinct without ever even having appreciated their existence and given them consideration,\u201d Walter Jetz, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University, U.S., told Mongabay.\n\nHere\u2019s our look at some of the new-to-science species described in 2024:\n\nVampire hedgehog and glamorous viper among 243 new species from the Greater Mekong\n\nTrimeresurus ciliaris, a pit viper. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nHipposideros kingstonae, a leaf-nosed bat. Image \u00a9 Pipat Soisook.\n\nRhabdophis hmongorum, the H\u2019mong keelback snake. Image \u00a9 Luan Thanh Nguyen.\n\nZhangixalus melanoleucus, a tree frog found in northeast Laos. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nTrimeresurus uetzi, a pit viper found in Myanmar. Image \u00a9 H.T. Lalremsanga.\n\nChiloschista quangdangii, a leafless orchid found in the trade. Image \u00a9 Truong Ba Vuong.\n\nLaodracon carsticola, a karst dragon lizard was first spotted by a guide on a zipline tour in Laos. Image \u00a9 Santi Xayyasith.\n\nThe Greater Mekong region revealed some of the year\u2019s most distinctive species. Local nature enthusiasts and researchers documented a hedgehog species with fang-like teeth, leading to its name vampire hedgehog (Hylomys macarong).\n\nThey also described a pit viper (Trimeresurus ciliaris) whose scales create the appearance of dramatic eyelashes, and a karst dragon lizard (Laodracon carsticola) first noticed by a local tour guide.\n\nThese findings illuminate the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and conservation challenges, as many species face immediate threats from development and wildlife trafficking.\n\nNew giant anaconda species found on Waorani Indigenous land in Ecuador\n\nA significant discovery has been made in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where scientists have identified a new species of giant anaconda in the Bameno region of Baihuaeri Waorani Territory. During their research, the team encountered an impressive female specimen measuring 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) in length from head to tail, though local Indigenous communities report encountering even larger individuals. The species faces multiple threats throughout its range, from deforestation destroying their habitat to direct hunting by humans and environmental degradation from oil spills.\n\nTree-dwelling frogs found in Madagascar\u2019s pandan trees\n\nIn Madagascar\u2019s eastern rainforests, three frog species living in pandan trees received their first scientific descriptions. Known locally as sahona vakoa (pandan frogs), these amphibians complete their entire life cycle within the water-filled spaces between the plants\u2019 spiky leaves. The species, now given the scientific names Guibemantis rianasoa, G. vakoa and G. ambakoana, exemplify how local ecological knowledge often precedes formal scientific documentation by generations.\n\nA new underwater mountain hosts deep-sea wonders off Chile\n\nAn expedition in the Southeast Pacific discovered more than 100 potentially new-to-science species on a previously unknown underwater mountain, including deep-sea corals (order Scleractinia), glass sponges, sea urchins (class Echinoidea), amphipods (order Amphipoda) and squat lobsters (family Galatheidae).\n\nThe expedition also sighted rare creatures like the flying spaghetti monster (Bathyphysa conifera) and Casper octopus (genus Grimpoteuthis).\n\nThe seamount, rising about 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) from the seafloor, about 1,450 km (900 mi) off Chile\u2019s coast, hosts thriving deep-sea ecosystems with ancient corals and glass sponges. The findings highlight the rich biodiversity of the high seas as the U.N. finalizes treaties to protect international waters.\n\nA flower persists in a patch of Ecuadorian forest\n\nResearchers found this new flowering plant species by chance, when they spotted a patch of forest along the road. The name Amalophyllon miraculum, reflects the \u2018miracle\u2019 of finding the plant in these unexpected fragments of protected forests. Currently, only two populations are known, both in small protected areas. This limited distribution has led to its preliminary assessment as Critically Endangered.\n\nThe area where the plant was found, known as Centinela, was once a vast, lush tropical forest, but is now largely cleared for agriculture. Experts estimate that 70-97% of western Ecuador\u2019s original forests have been destroyed since the mid-20th century. The remaining patches of Centinela forest are like islands of biodiversity amid a sea of farmland.\n\nToothed toads emerge from mountain forests of Vietnam and China\n\nTwo new species of rare, toothed toads were discovered in Vietnam and China: the Mount Po Ma Lung toothed toad (Oreolalax adelphos) and the Yanyuan toothed toad (Oreolalax yanyuanensis). These amphibians are characterized by an unusual row of tiny teeth on the roof of their mouths. The discovery brings the total known toothed toad species to 21. However, more than half are already considered threatened due to habitat loss and degradation.\n\nDwarf squirrel and blobfish among 27 new species found in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo\n\nIn Peru\u2019s densely populated Alto Mayo region, home to 280,000 people, scientists working with local communities documented 27 species previously unknown to Western science.\n\nThe species included an amphibious mouse (Necromys aquaticus) found in just one patch of swamp forest; a fish with an unexplained blob-like head structure (Trichomycterus sp. nov.); an agile dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus sp. nov.); and a tree-climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa sp. nov.). These findings demonstrate how even human-modified landscapes can harbor biodiversity not yet documented by scientists.\n\nThe clouded tiger cat gains species status\n\nScientists formally described a new small wild cat species, the clouded tiger cat (Leopardus pardinoides), found in high-altitude cloud forests from Central to South America. This taxonomic clarification has major conservation implications, as new data indicate all three tiger cat species have experienced dramatic range reductions, with the clouded tiger cat\u2019s habitat particularly threatened by human activities.\n\nA rare ghost palm from Borneo\n\nThough long used by local Iban communities in western Borneo for basketry and edible shoots, scientists finally gave a formal name to a distinctive rattan palm after 90 years. Named Plectocomiopsis hantu (\u201chantu\u201d meaning ghost in Indonesian and Malay), the palm is known for its ghostly appearance, with white undersides to the leaves and gray stems. It\u2019s currently known from only three locations in or near protected rainforest habitats.\n\nA new family of African plants that can\u2019t photosynthesize\n\nScientists named an entirely new family of plants, Afrothismiaceae, which have evolved to take all their nutrients from fungal partners rather than through photosynthesis. Found in African forests, these rare plants only appear above ground to fruit and flower. Most species in this family are extremely rare or possibly extinct, with the majority recorded only once in Cameroon.\n\nNew orchids from Indonesia\n\nThe orchid family is immense, and new species are found most years. This year, researchers described five new species from islands throughout Indonesia. These are: Coelogyne albomarginata from Sumatra, Coelogyne spinifera from Seram, and Dendrobium cokronagoroi, the Dendrobium wanmae (a critically endangered species) and Mediocalcar gemma-coronae (endangered), all from western New Guinea.\n\nA lonely liana faces extinction from cement production in Vietnam\n\nA new genus and species of green-flowered liana, Chlorohiptage vietnamensis, was discovered in Vietnam but is already assessed as critically endangered. Its limestone karst habitat is being cleared for quarries to make cement, threatening the only known population of this unique plant.\n\nTwo new mammals from India\n\nTwo new mammal species in were described in Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, Northeast India\u2019s biggest national park. A forest officer documented the presence of the small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus), the world\u2019s tiniest otter species. The small-clawed otter, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, joins two other otter species already known to inhabit Kaziranga.\n\nThe binturong (Arctictis binturong), an elusive nocturnal tree-dweller also known as the bearcat, was photographed by tour guide Chirantanu Saikia in January 2024. The binturong is found exclusively in Northeast India and requires dense forest canopy for survival. It has become increasingly rare due to deforestation.\n\nWhile local residents had previously reported sightings of both species, these photographs provide the first concrete evidence of their presence in the park. Conservation officials believe these discoveries suggest the potential presence of other undocumented species within the park, highlighting the importance of continued wildlife surveys and protection efforts in the region.\n\nOne of the tiniest frogs ever found in Brazil\n\nScientists in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest described a remarkable new species of frog, Brachycephalus dacnis, measuring just 6.95 millimeters in length \u2013 about the size of a pencil eraser. Unlike other similarly tiny frogs that often struggle with balance, this species has maintained its inner ear structure, allowing it to jump gracefully up to 32 times its body length. The discovery in S\u00e3o Paulo state\u2019s remaining Atlantic Forest highlights both the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and the urgent need for conservation, as this critically threatened ecosystem now stands at just 13% of its original extent, potentially harboring many more undiscovered species.\n\nBanner image of Leopardus pardinoides, or the clouded tiger cat, as a new species.

            "article_content": "A new artificial intelligence (AI) model has just achieved human-level results on a test designed to measure \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d.\n\nOn December 20, OpenAI\u2019s o3 system scored 85% on the ARC-AGI benchmark, well above the previous AI best score of 55% and on par with the average human score. It also scored well on a very difficult mathematics test.\n\nCreating artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is the stated goal of all the major AI research labs. At first glance, OpenAI appears to have at least made a significant step towards this goal.\n\nWhile scepticism remains, many AI researchers and developers feel something just changed. For many, the prospect of AGI now seems more real, urgent and closer than anticipated. Are they right?\n\nGeneralisation and intelligence\n\nTo understand what the o3 result means, you need to understand what the ARC-AGI test is all about. In technical terms, it\u2019s a test of an AI system\u2019s \u201csample efficiency\u201d in adapting to something new \u2013 how many examples of a novel situation the system needs to see to figure out how it works.\n\nAn AI system like ChatGPT (GPT-4) is not very sample efficient. It was \u201ctrained\u201d on millions of examples of human text, constructing probabilistic \u201crules\u201d about which combinations of words are most likely.\n\nThe result is pretty good at common tasks. It is bad at uncommon tasks, because it has less data (fewer samples) about those tasks.\n\nUntil AI systems can learn from small numbers of examples and adapt with more sample efficiency, they will only be used for very repetitive jobs and ones where the occasional failure is tolerable.\n\nThe ability to accurately solve previously unknown or novel problems from limited samples of data is known as the capacity to generalise. It is widely considered a necessary, even fundamental, element of intelligence.\n\nGrids and patterns\n\nThe ARC-AGI benchmark tests for sample efficient adaptation using little grid square problems like the one below. The AI needs to figure out the pattern that turns the grid on the left into the grid on the right.\n\nEach question gives three examples to learn from. The AI system then needs to figure out the rules that \u201cgeneralise\u201d from the three examples to the fourth.\n\nThese are a lot like the IQ tests sometimes you might remember from school.\n\nWeak rules and adaptation\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how OpenAI has done it, but the results suggest the o3 model is highly adaptable. From just a few examples, it finds rules that can be generalised.\n\nTo figure out a pattern, we shouldn\u2019t make any unnecessary assumptions, or be more specific than we really have to be. In theory, if you can identify the \u201cweakest\u201d rules that do what you want, then you have maximised your ability to adapt to new situations.\n\nWhat do we mean by the weakest rules? The technical definition is complicated, but weaker rules are usually ones that can be described in simpler statements.\n\nIn the example above, a plain English expression of the rule might be something like: \u201cAny shape with a protruding line will move to the end of that line and \u2018cover up\u2019 any other shapes it overlaps with.\u201d\n\nSearching chains of thought?\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know how OpenAI achieved this result just yet, it seems unlikely they deliberately optimised the o3 system to find weak rules. However, to succeed at the ARC-AGI tasks it must be finding them.\n\nWe do know that OpenAI started with a general-purpose version of the o3 model (which differs from most other models, because it can spend more time \u201cthinking\u201d about difficult questions) and then trained it specifically for the ARC-AGI test.\n\nFrench AI researcher Francois Chollet, who designed the benchmark, believes o3 searches through different \u201cchains of thought\u201d describing steps to solve the task. It would then choose the \u201cbest\u201d according to some loosely defined rule, or \u201cheuristic\u201d.\n\nThis would be \u201cnot dissimilar\u201d to how Google\u2019s AlphaGo system searched through different possible sequences of moves to beat the world Go champion.\n\nYou can think of these chains of thought like programs that fit the examples. Of course, if it is like the Go-playing AI, then it needs a heuristic, or loose rule, to decide which program is best.\n\nThere could be thousands of different seemingly equally valid programs generated. That heuristic could be \u201cchoose the weakest\u201d or \u201cchoose the simplest\u201d.\n\nHowever, if it is like AlphaGo then they simply had an AI create a heuristic. This was the process for AlphaGo. Google trained a model to rate different sequences of moves as better or worse than others.\n\nWhat we still don\u2019t know\n\nThe question then is, is this really closer to AGI? If that is how o3 works, then the underlying model might not be much better than previous models.\n\nThe concepts the model learns from language might not be any more suitable for generalisation than before. Instead, we may just be seeing a more generalisable \u201cchain of thought\u201d found through the extra steps of training a heuristic specialised to this test. The proof, as always, will be in the pudding.\n\nAlmost everything about o3 remains unknown. OpenAI has limited disclosure to a few media presentations and early testing to a handful of researchers, laboratories and AI safety institutions.\n\nTruly understanding the potential of o3 will require extensive work, including evaluations, an understanding of the distribution of its capacities, how often it fails and how often it succeeds.\n\nWhen o3 is finally released, we\u2019ll have a much better idea of whether it is approximately as adaptable as an average human.\n\nIf so, it could have a huge, revolutionary, economic impact, ushering in a new era of self-improving accelerated intelligence. We will require new benchmarks for AGI itself and serious consideration of how it ought to be governed.\n\nIf not, then this will still be an impressive result. However, everyday life will remain much the same.\n\nMichael Timothy Bennett, PhD Student, School of Computing, Australian National University and Elija Perrier, Research Fellow, Stanford Center for Responsible Quantum Technology, Stanford University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "article_content": "Once upon a time, the company known as OpenAI started off as a non-profit company. The for-profit side of things didn\u2019t even exist until 2019, according to the company\u2019s own website. But it looks like the younger side of the company is going to be taking control of the organisation. Over the weekend, the board has decided to transition said for-profit arm into what\u2019s called a Public Benefit Corporation.\n\nFor context, a PBC is an organisation that tries to balance profit and still providing a positive impact on society. According to the announcement post, this change was deemed necessary as improving AI tech \u201cwould need far more compute, and therefore far more capital, than we could obtain with donations in order to pursue our mission\u201d.\n\nThe post notes that this is set to happen sometime in 2025, which is a mere two days away at the time of writing. As part of the change, \u201cthe PBC will run and control OpenAI\u2019s operations and business, while the non-profit will hire a leadership team an staff to pursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science\u201d.\n\nIn a way, it may be thanks to the for-profit arm that the public got a taste of ChatGPT, with paying customers obviously getting the juicier cuts of the tech. But it remains to be seen what this transition would mean for the company in the longer term, and in what way it will affect its users and non-enterprise customers.\n\n(Source: OpenAI [1], [2])\n\nWhat\u2019s your Reaction? +1 0 +1 0 +1 0 +1 0 +1 0 +1 0"

            "article_content": "Recent community discussions have reignited the debate over whether Chinese tech giant Baidu may have developed the key theoretical groundwork for large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models before America\u2019s OpenAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLarge models, or \u201cfoundation models\u201d, are at the forefront of AI development , with their rapid iterations driving cutting-edge applications. While the United States is generally viewed as leading advanced AI model innovation, some argue that China may have started exploring these concepts earlier.\n\nCentral to large-model development is the \u201cscaling law\u201d \u2013 a principle that asserts the larger the training data and model parameters, the stronger the model\u2019s intelligence capabilities. Widely credited to OpenAI\u2019s 2020 paper, \u201cScaling Laws for Neural Language Models\u201d, this idea has since become a cornerstone in AI research.\n\nThe OpenAI paper showed that increasing model parameters, training data and compute resources boosts performance following a power-law relationship. This insight guided the development of subsequent large-scale AI models.\n\nHowever, Dario Amodei, a co-author of the OpenAI paper and former vice-president of research at the company, shared in a November podcast that he had observed similar phenomena as early as 2014, during his time at Baidu.\n\nAdvertisement"

            "article_content": "For anyone living under a social media rock, #vanlife has become one of the biggest viral trends of the last few years.\n\nTaking off during the pandemic, on TikTok the hashtag has been viewed more than 12 billion times, with a further 15 million posts on Instagram.\n\nThe nomadic way of life is popular with (mainly) young people, and preceded the 'underconsumption core' lifestyle.\n\nGolden sunsets, expansive beaches, fairy lights and romantic filters; living out of a van is as Instagram aesthetic as it gets (on the surface).\n\nBut what about living out of an electric car? Could that be the most eco and luxury van life possible? Or is the reality just a photo opportunity but a holiday to avoid?\n\nThis is Money\u2019s Freda Lewis-Stempel took a new Tesla Model Y with its own specially designed 'Air Mattress' and \u2018Camp Mode\u2019 to one of the remotest islands in the UK to find out....\n\nCan you really sleep in a Tesla? This is Money's Motoring Reporter Freda Lewis-Stempel puts the electric car version of the #vanlife trend to a very remote test....\n\nHow the Model Y is designed for 'van life' glamping?\n\nIt makes sense to first explain how Tesla has taken the American \u2018van life\u2019 idea and added special features to the Model Y SUV to make it double up as a home on wheels.\n\nTesla Air Mattress: This \u00a3200 blow-up mattress has been designed to fit the rear of the car perfectly when the back seats are folded down. Penned on tracing paper, it has the cutouts in precisely the correct places in order for it to sit flush to the floor around wheel arches and arm rests.\n\nIt pumps up almost instantly when connected to the car's 12V outlet in the boot.\n\nJust roll the air mattress out, plug the air pump into the 12V, slot the air pump nozzle into the air mattress intake, turn the air pump on and watch it inflate.\n\nAt this point you can decide to go full glamping \u2018boujee\u2019 and bring a sheet, pillows and duvet like we did, or you can go more pop-up tent style and just use a sleeping bag and inflatable pillow.\n\nTesla has a specially shaped Air Mattress for its Model Y SUV that inflates to turn the car into a bed for the night\n\nTesla's Camp Mode is another sleeping-friendly feature that keeps the cabin at the perfect temperature overnight to make sure you don't get too hot or cold\n\nCamp Mode: Sort of genius from Tesla, Camp Mode maintains the optimum temperature and airflow within the cabin while you sleep so you don\u2019t wake up freezing cold or boiling hot in the middle of the night.\n\nIt also maintains the lighting setup you want or even music or a podcast if that helps you sleep.\n\nThere's even a Camp Profile which remembers your preferences and sets them automatically when you want to conk out for the night.\n\nTo enter Camp Mode, just tap the temperature menu icon on the bottom of the screen and select Camp (or use the Tesla app).\n\nSentry Mode, auto lock and the Model Y\u2019s alarm system are all disabled with Camp Mode so the alarm doesn\u2019t go off every time you exist - just remember to lock the car yourself while you sleep!\n\nWhy Scotland? Scotland is popular for wild camping because of the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, which gives everyone the right to access Scotland's outdoor spaces. You can park and camp by the side of the road as long as you aren't blocking access or parked dangerously. The Outdoor Access Code does stipulate you should camp away from roads, but campervans frequently park in larger lay-bys. As some of the most remote and dramatic countryside in the UK, especially on the islands, Scotland is also a brilliant place to put EV charging and range anxiety to the test too.\n\nDay 1/night 1: Regrettable decision? It can only get better...\n\nMy plucky school friend and I left London at around 5.30pm to drive up to the Peak District.\n\nIt was all going swimmingly, cruising up the M6 in the warm, extremely comfortable and smooth Model Y.\n\nThough I tend to find Teslas a bit clinical (or 'spaceship-y', as my friend said) for long journeys, their performance is undeniably strong.\n\nThe space, comfort, and how Teslas hold their range makes driving for hours minimum effort, and the Y was no different.\n\nDeciding to charge at the Superchargers near Stoke-on-Trent - because we didn't know how much range Camp Mode would use overnight - we snuck in the back door of a restaurant nearby to use the loo to brush our teeth and get ready for 'bed\u2019.\n\nThere were a few funny looks as we set the air mattress up for the night at the Superchargers (so we didn\u2019t have to figure it out for the first time in the middle of nowhere in the pitch-black Peaks), but it was very easy to set up.\n\nWhile the Y finished charging, we used the Theatre function - which has Netflix, YouTube, Hulu etc - to watch the different Christmas adverts on the touchscreen; Waitrose\u2019s \u2018who dunnit\u2019 was of course the clear winner.\n\nThanks to Tesla's Theatre suite we could watch all the Christmas adverts on YouTube while the car charged\n\nBrushing your teeth and washing your face in a restaurant loo near a Tesla Supercharger is the glamorous reality of Tesla living\n\nThen we drove off in search of our sleeping spot in the wild for the night.\n\nWe\u2019d pre-selected a place using the Park4night app, but driving up to a lay-by under a remote bridge and encountering just one guy and his camper van we got the heebie-jeebies and decided to find an alternative.\n\nThe only other option nearby was a lay-by/field gate entrance, and (after accidentally driving through someone\u2019s farmyard) we decided this was the best of two rather unappealing options, as it was already almost midnight.\n\nOff to bed (a bed that was as steep as Everest because the parking spot was on a sharp incline) I awoke just over four hours later at 4.55am.\n\nMy friend had seemingly disappeared. In a bleary state, I thought she'd been abducted, but thankfully she\u2019d just moved to the front seat to try and sleep.\n\nTurning the headlights on, we had a near heart attack (my second in 10 minutes) when they picked up a Land Rover Discovery that had silently turned up sometime between 12.40 and 4.55am.\n\nConvincing ourselves we weren\u2019t going to end up as front page horror story news, we tried to get back to sleep.\n\nIt was at this point we learnt two valuable EV glamping lessons: never park on an incline and an overinflated Air Mattress is, as I ruefully summarised, like sleeping on a slab of rock.\n\nWaking up in Leek in Staffordshire wasn't the most picturesque first wake up in the Tesla I'd envisioned as the beautiful countryside was hidden in fog and we'd had 4 hours of sleep each\n\nI failed to fall back to sleep, but my friend did, so I watched a very cold and wet dawn creep in through the windows and panoramic sunroof.\n\nI also watched two other cars come and go \u2013 one of which was a hunter\u2019s van containing three Hound of the Baskervilles-sized hunting dogs.\n\nIn the end, my friend and I ended up getting four hours sleep each.\n\nIt wasn't a great way to kick-off but thanks to the Camp Mode we were at least nice and warm. And, as only a year before we'd spent a night in the Peaks in minus five degrees on top a Jeep Wrangler in a Tentbox, we knew how absolutely brutal car 'glamping' really can be in cold weather.\n\nGoing for a brisk wake-up walk around 8am, we packed down the Air Mattress and set off for our pre-Scotland charging and feed stop at Tebay.\n\nDay 2/night 2: How much difference a day can make\n\nThe Tebay pit stop seriously perked us both up.\n\nThe car had a full charge on the Superchargers - we were charging to 100 per cent, which isn't as good for the battery as charging to 80 per cent but it's sensible for wilderness camping to have maximum range - while I managed a nap.\n\nThe nap was followed by a shower (you swap your car key for the shower key at Tebay and it\u2019s free to use), and we both scoffed full English breakfasts.\n\nThen it was back into the car for another three hours of driving up to Edinburgh for an afternoon 'city break'.\n\nThe roads were opening up and the scenery became road trip goals - in my opinion the best motorway driving in the UK is the Cumbria-Borders stretch - and everything was looking up.\n\nEdinburgh was a chance to get some steps and movement in, and a bit of big city excitement before the total and utter isolation that the next sleeping spot would bring.\n\nWe'd pre-planned to sleep in a very remote valley between Edinburgh and the Ardrossan ferry terminal where we had a 9am ferry to catch the next morning.\n\nI wanted to try Edinburgh public charging because it has a bad reputation, and although I did manage to find a charger, for a capital city Edinburgh charging has some way to go\n\nWe drove for about three hours to walk around Edinburgh and find some hot food before our next lay-by camp\n\nI also wanted to test Edinburgh's EV charging infrastructure because it has a bad reputation for being underprovided.\n\nIn reality this is unfortunately true - considering it\u2019s the capital of Scotland the charging options are pretty slim.\n\nWe weren\u2019t fussy and didn\u2019t mind what speed we charged, but that didn't really help. There weren't many chargers and almost all of them were in use.\n\nAnd unlike London, Edinburgh doesn't have lots of lamppost chargers, so all the on-street chargers are taken by residents.\n\nWe did, however, find one fast charger near George Street, so we walked around Edinburgh and had some hot food while the Model Y slow charged back up to 100 per cent.\n\nAt around 6pm we drove off to find our next Park4night place.\n\nThe second night camping location was the stuff of Instagram posts - although murky weather the remote Scottish hills were beautiful and it felt safe which led to a great nights' sleep\n\nThe Model Y has massive windows and a huge panoramic roof so you get 360 views when you wake up\n\nThis time we wanted the spot to be as isolated as possible, and we found it; a single-track road about 30 minutes from the coast without a soul in sight. Not a star, not an animal \u2013 nothing. And it felt so much safer.\n\nI should explain that my school friend and I both grew up in very remote parts of Herefordshire and Shropshire so having no-one around feels safer to us than having people nearby, but over people might entirely disagree with this logic.\n\nFeeling far more secure than night one allowed us to relax into our bedtime camping 'routine' (i.e. cleaning our teeth with water from a bottle).\n\nAnd we got the bed blowing-up level right this time, which meant the Air Mattress went from being a slab of rock to incredibly comfortable.\n\nWhile we could use the Tesla Model Y's Theatre mode again, part of the relaxation of camping is winding down reading a book\n\nThen we got the Camp Mode temperature perfect, read our books and drifted off to sleep in our very cosy hotel on wheels. We slept like logs.\n\nI woke about 6am to a glorious stormy Scottish dawn sky, and an empty valley of mountains.\n\nIt was everything I\u2019d thought Tesla living would be. And the night became an amusing memory.\n\nDay three/night three: Tesla living on the Isle of Arran - as good as glamping gets\n\nScotland has 'right-to-access' laws so it's much easier to camp in a car in Scotland than England. A place as remote as the Isle of Arran is a real test for glamping in an EV\n\nStarting off at 7.20am to drive 20 minutes for an ultra-rapid top-up before we boarded the Ardrossan car ferry, we pulled up at the InstaVolt chargers outside Stevenston McDonalds. Who doesn't love a retail park and a Maccies hash brown before 8am?\n\nThe loos gave us the chance to brush our teeth and clean our faces while the car went from around 80 to 100 per cent charge - after all, glamping is all about glamour.\n\nThe Model Y Long Range AWD has a range of 373 miles which gives you around 330/340 real world range.\n\nWe didn't actually need to be at 100 per cent before going across to the Isle of Arran - which is only 56 miles in circumference - but, while there are a few chargers in the 'capital' of Arran (Brodrick), ZapMap said they only take RFID cards so we played it very over safe.\n\nWe put the car on some Instavolt ultra-rapid chargers near the ferry port before we boarded\n\nWhile living out of a Tesla you have to find food and washing facilities wherever you can, and sometimes it's McDonalds or nothing (even at 8am)\n\nSentry Mode - Tesla's anti-theft feature which records footage using the car's threat detecting external cameras and sensors - came into its own during the crossing, as did the Tesla app\n\nBoarding the Ardrossan ferry, we were in excellent EV company with the four cars nearest us all being EVs. Clearly range anxiety isn't a thing in the Scottish Isles.\n\nDuring the 55 minute crossing, Sentry Mode - Tesla's anti-theft feature which records footage using the car's threat detecting external cameras and sensors - came into its own during the crossing, as did the Tesla app in general.\n\nI felt very smug knowing that the none of the many car alarms going off belonged to the Model Y because the Tesla app hadn't alerted me to any issues.\n\nWe also had far too much fun watching ourselves on the Sentry Mode cameras disembarking the ferry as we sat waiting for the cars in front to drive off.\n\nFor the rest of the day we drove around Arran, enjoying the freedom of the car and lack of time restraints, like hotel check-ins, and simply let nature lead us. We went for a walk, swam in the very cold sea, and watched the wildlife - Arran is famous for its seals.\n\nThe Isle of Arran only has four public chargers and you can only get a ferry to the mainland: There are three in Brodrick and one near Blackwaterfoot so you can really test range anxiety\n\nDriving around the Isle of Arran with no check-in times to abide by we could enjoy the scenery and outdoor pursuits to our own schedule\n\nTesla's cabin pre-conditioning feature on the app was also a godsend for when we wanted to come back to a warm car and heated seats and steering wheel after a freezing dip.\n\nWhile our day activities were quite messy, the Tesla and its vegan seats were very easy to keep clean.\n\nAs a living in a car goes it was remarkably easy to stay tidy and the vast storage throughout meant we were never short of space for our stuff.\n\nThe Model Y has 854 litres of boot space as well as a 117-litre frunk: more than enough space for all our 'glamping' stuff and the front trunk became a designated space for wet swimming costumes, towels and muddy boats.\n\nThe hooks above the passenger doors were also useful to hang our clothes to dry.\n\nThe Tesla has lots of space, and it was very easy to keep clean. Even if we left the bed in place, we still had plenty of space for our bags and the frunk meant we could separate wet clothes\n\nAlthough the Model Y has bi-directional charging (where you can power appliances from the car), we didn't take a kettle or camping chairs mainly because, without an awning or a settled camping spot, sitting outside in the bracing Scottish winter wind didn't seem very appealing.\n\nWhile the car means you can go anywhere, anytime, playing everything by ear also has its downfalls: We drove to get dinner at 6pm on the far side of the island only to be told the restaurant was fully-booked.\n\nAlthough we did eventually manage to have a very early dinner at a hotel near Brodrick, the Tesla glamping lesson of the day here would be to at least pre-book your meal reservations, especially if it's out of season.\n\nParked up against the sea, Tesla camping on the Isle of Arran is truly an amazing experience\n\nDuring the afternoon, we'd driven from the north west of Arran across to the north east and had passed many a lovely, big, isolated lay-by, noting a few that we'd be happy to park for the night in (frankly we were spoilt for choice on Arran).\n\nAmusingly (or mildly concerningly depending how you look at it), I'd turned to my friend as I eyed up one particular lay-by (the one we ended up choosing) and said; 'I'll never look at a lay-by the same way again'. She said she'd been thinking the exact same thing.\n\nIn the space of a few nights, Tesla camping had changed us - we'd become discerning connoisseurs of lay-bys. I will forever look at scenic lay-by and think 'that looks like a very nice place to spend the night in an EV'.\n\nIn the end, we chose one glorious lay-by near the sea, and with our glamping night routine down to a T, we settled in for our last sleep.\n\nWe watched Netflix's Nobody Wants This from our Air Mattress bed, thoroughly enjoying the Model Y mobile cinema offered to modern day EV nomads, and the brooding backdrop of the dark Scottish hills.\n\nWaiting to board the ferry back to mainland UK: Is Tesla glamping for the fainthearted? No. But is it a fantastic adventure? Yes.\n\nIt felt sad to say goodbye to our house on wheels on the drive home as we'd become quite attached\n\nThe next morning, after we had one last cold sea swim before boarding the ferry to begin our drive back to London, we both agreed we'd happily spend another three nights sleeping in the Tesla.\n\nLiving out of one? No. Glamping out of one again? Without a doubt.\n\nJust make sure your friends are up for an adventure and aren't at all precious..."

            "article_content": "There are a lot of things in the world that we don't quite understand. And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

            "article_content": "There are massive ROI opportunities in 2025 with crypto presales that continue to offer a golden ticket for those looking for significant returns. By entering early, traders often secure coins at a fraction of their future listing price, leading to substantial profit potential. As the New Year approaches, presales are intensifying, with a few standing out due to their modern solutions and profitable structures.\n\nBlockDAG (BDAG), Aureal One (DLUME), DexBoss (DEBO), and Flockerz (FLOCKEZ) are among the altcoins that will explode in 2025, each presenting a distinct value proposition.\n\nFrom gaming metaverses and DeFi tools to decentralized governance models, these projects meet various needs while promising returns that could dramatically boost portfolios.\n\n1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Pioneering Scalability in Crypto Presales for 2025\n\nBlockDAG (BDAG) is transforming crypto presales with its expansive platform that offers unmatched scalability and creativity. Priced at just $0.0234 per coin, BlockDAG has amassed a remarkable $173 million, distributing 17.5 billion coins. Its current presale, batch 26, is nearly complete.\n\nEarly BDAG coin backers have already seen a 2,240% ROI, and the ongoing BDAG400 tiered bonus is attracting even more interest. This promotion grants bonuses exceeding 250% across the first five BDAG purchases.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s main strength is its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, enabling concurrent transactions for peak speed and efficiency. This framework is perfect for developers creating decentralized apps across sectors from gaming to DeFi. With a focus on scalability, BlockDAG ensures its ecosystem thrives as user demand grows.\n\nThe confirmation of the network\u2019s 2025 mainnet launch is further boosting trader confidence. BlockDAG also supports developers with its low-code/no-code tools and community incentives. For those looking for a crypto presale that combines growth potential with stability, BlockDAG remains a key altcoin that will explode in 2025.\n\n2. Aureal One (DLUME): Gaming Meets Blockchain Innovation\n\nAureal One merges the worlds of gaming and blockchain, crafting a metaverse-focused environment designed for quick transactions and minimal costs. It leverages Zero-Knowledge Rollups for improved scalability and efficiency, which is a hit among game creators.\n\nEarly adopters of DLUME could see significant returns. Highlights include popular games such as \u201cClash of Tiles\u201d and decision-making roles for coin holders. While its success leans heavily on its market acceptance, Aureal One remains a promising altcoin that will explode in 2025 for those interested in blockchain-powered entertainment.\n\nDexBoss revolutionizes the DeFi sector with a set of tools made for both experienced traders and beginners. It offers features like liquidity farming, staking, and high-leverage trading, covering over 2,000 cryptocurrencies for a diverse trading experience.\n\nIts presale attracts attention with a strategy of buying back and burning coins, potentially enhancing DEBO\u2019s value. However, the high-leverage options might pose risks for the uninitiated. Nonetheless, DexBoss is a top choice for an effective and pioneering DeFi platform with great growth prospects.\n\n4. Flockerz (FLOCKEZ): Decentralization Through Community Participation\n\nAs the final mention in our list of altcoins that will explode, Flockerz introduces a vote-to-earn system that places its community at the forefront of governance, rewarding participation.\n\nThe FLOCKEZ coin includes staking rewards, encouraging long-term engagement. Despite its meme coin label, Flockerz offers genuine utility, especially in supporting sustainable, community-led blockchain initiatives. It appeals to those looking for a blend of enjoyment and practical value in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nChoosing Your Next Crypto Opportunity\n\nEach crypto presale mentioned provides distinct benefits. Aureal One combines gaming with blockchain for entertainment lovers, DexBoss offers easy-to-use DeFi solutions, and Flockerz emphasizes community involvement with its governance model.\n\nBlockDAG stands out with a robust framework that includes confirmed scalability, a forthcoming mainnet launch, and superior presale success. Its diverse features and support for both developers and traders position it as an attractive option for substantial returns.\n\nUltimately, the right cryptocurrency should match your needs, but BlockDAG\u2019s proven performance and potential for future growth mark it as a key altcoin that will explode in 2025."

            "article_content": "In What Ways Does AI Contribute to Startup Scalability?\n\nUnlock the secrets of how AI accelerates startup growth with in-depth analysis and insights from industry experts. Delve into the transformative power of AI across various business functions, from enhancing customer support to optimizing operational efficiency. This article sheds light on the pivotal role AI plays in driving scalability and innovation in today\u2019s competitive startup landscape.\n\nAI Automates Customer Support\n\nAI technologies contribute to the scalability of startups by automating repetitive tasks and enabling smarter decision-making, freeing up resources to focus on growth and innovation. One great example is the use of AI-powered customer support tools like chatbots.\n\nTake Intercom, for instance. By integrating AI-driven bots, startups can handle thousands of customer queries simultaneously without scaling their human support teams at the same pace. These bots use natural language processing to resolve common issues instantly or route more complex problems to the right person, ensuring efficient service while reducing operational costs.\n\nThis approach not only scales customer interactions as the startup grows but also gathers valuable data from these interactions, providing insights to refine products or services.\n\nChris Raulf, International AI and SEO Expert | Founder & President, Boulder SEO Marketing\n\nAI Revolutionizes Hiring Processes\n\nAI revolutionizes hiring processes, enabling startups to scale teams with unmatched speed and accuracy. It can analyze thousands of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, assess candidates, and predict cultural fit seamlessly. This ensures that scaling a workforce doesn\u2019t compromise the quality or diversity of hires. AI also reduces onboarding times by automating training modules tailored to individual roles effectively. Startups grow faster when talent acquisition becomes an AI-powered strategic advantage.\n\nWhen developing Toggl Hire, AI helped us create smarter candidate assessments tailored to skills. By analyzing test results, the system predicts a candidate\u2019s success probability for specific roles accurately. This reduced hiring times for startups using Toggl Hire, helping them scale teams quicker. The scalability of the tool itself brought exponential growth to our user base globally. It\u2019s proof of how AI-powered innovation fuels business expansion directly.\n\nAlari Aho, CEO and Founder, Toggl Inc\n\nAI Transforms Recruitment at X0PA\n\nAI has completely transformed how we approach scaling in recruitment at X0PA. By tapping into a pool of 250 million profiles worldwide, we enable companies to discover top talent even before a single job post goes live. Our AI doesn\u2019t stop at access-it curates profiles across LinkedIn and all major job boards, delivering a shortlist of only the most relevant candidates. This approach has saved recruiters over 100,000 days of manual effort, letting them focus on meaningful interactions instead of administrative tasks. Scaling with precision, speed, and reach is how we redefine modern recruitment.\n\nNina Alag Suri, CEO, XOPA AI\n\nAI Boosts Productivity and Efficiency\n\nThe biggest contribution of AI integration, whether in startups or established industries, lies in its ability to boost productivity and efficiency. Tasks that once took ten steps can now be completed in 5 or even 3, empowering employees to multitask without compromising focus\u2014a game-changer for startups.\n\nIn our case, integrating an AI chatbot for our real estate MLS website, The Canadian Home, was one of our best and most profitable decisions. As many of our users are first-time homebuyers, they naturally have countless questions. Initially, our customer support team was overwhelmed by the repetitive inquiries, making it hard to manage effectively. The AI chatbot now handles basic questions instantly, filtering out more straightforward queries and allowing our team to focus on more complex issues. This not only boosted efficiency but also increased conversions.\n\nAI is already transforming industries worldwide, and its role will only grow in the future. Adapting to these advancements is not just smart, it\u2019s essential.\n\nRobin Cherian, CEO, The Canadian Home\n\nAI Enhances Fraud Detection\n\nIn my experience, it enhances fraud detection for fintech startups. AI algorithms can quickly identify patterns and anomalies that could indicate potential fraudulent activity. AI-driven fraud detection systems like Feedzai or Kount analyze transactional data to identify suspicious activities. This saves time and resources for startups.\n\nA payments startup scaled safely by using AI to monitor real-time transactions, reducing fraud rates and building customer trust without deploying a large fraud investigation team. According to Feedzai, their technology helped the startup increase revenue by 30% and save $1.5 million in fraud losses within a year.\n\nI would point out that AI technologies help with fraud detection and assist in automating processes for startups. Many administrative tasks can be time-consuming and costly for startups, especially as they grow and onboard more customers or clients. AI-powered chatbots can handle common customer inquiries and support requests without the need for constant manual input from human employees.\n\nKevin Baragona, Founder @ DeepAI, Deep AI\n\nAI Improves Lead Qualification\n\nAI technologies help startups scale by automating repetitive tasks and providing insights that guide smarter decision-making. Startups often face limited resources, and AI allows teams to focus on high-value activities instead of getting stuck in operational bottlenecks.\n\nWe integrated AI into lead qualification. Instead of manually sorting and scoring leads, the AI models analyzed patterns from past sales data to prioritize prospects most likely to convert. This change reduced time spent on low-quality leads by 50 percent and allowed the sales team to focus on building relationships. Within six months, we saw a 30 percent increase in pipeline velocity.\n\nV. Frank Sondors, Founder, Salesforge AI\n\nAI Enhances Content Services\n\nOur development of AI-enhanced content services revealed a crucial insight about startup scaling.\n\nCombining AI efficiency with human expertise revolutionized our production capacity. Our HOTH AI Content Plus service slashed content creation time by 60% while maintaining quality standards. This breakthrough lets startups produce consistent, SEO-optimized content at scale without draining resources.\n\nNumbers tell the scaling story. By integrating AI into our content workflow, we\u2019ve helped startups produce in one month what used to take six months. The freed-up resources let them focus on growth strategies instead of content creation bottlenecks.\n\nSuccess in scaling requires strategic AI adoption. We found that using AI to handle initial drafts while keeping human editors for refinement creates the perfect balance. This model lets startups maintain quality while scaling operations \u2013 a winning formula I\u2019ve seen work across our 200,000+ client base.\n\nMy advice for startups: Start with one core process that directly impacts growth. Let AI handle repetitive tasks while your team focuses on strategy and creativity.\n\nMarc Hardgrove, CEO, The Hoth\n\nAI Empowers Efficient Scaling\n\nAI technologies empower startups to scale efficiently by automating repetitive tasks and delivering data-driven insights that enhance decision-making. For instance, integrating AI-powered chatbots in customer support allows startups to handle thousands of queries simultaneously, reducing the need for large support teams while ensuring 24/7 service. One example is a SaaS startup I worked with that implemented an AI-based lead-scoring system, which prioritized high-quality leads for the sales team. This not only increased conversion rates but also optimized resource allocation, enabling the business to scale its sales operations rapidly without proportionally increasing costs.\n\nJayanti Katariya, CEO, Moon Invoice\n\nAI Streamlines Customer Support\n\nAs someone who specializes in AI, I can say with confidence that AI adoption can really be a game-changer for startups. AI has two main advantages: it\u2019s fast and cost-friendly. Anything that has to do with repetitive tasks can be automated with AI, saving the company tons of time and human effort. At the same time, the teams can then focus on more strategic tasks that require contextual understanding, which AI obviously lacks. This way the work is distributed between humans and AI according to the strengths of both. On top of that, tasks related to data collection and analysis can be performed even better by AI. It does it faster and more accurately because there\u2019s no risk of human error. As a result, a well-executed adoption of AI can significantly speed up operations and improve the quality of work.\n\nOne example of a very common, yet extremely effective AI implementation is AI chatbots. We\u2019ve integrated one on our website as well. It can totally improve your customer service without you needing to put extra hours or effort into it. Your clients have access to real-time support 24/7, which creates a better user journey and increases customer satisfaction, both of which contribute to conversions. The company, at the same time, can focus more on improving the core products and big picture strategizing.\n\nPavlo Tkhir, CTO at Euristiq, Euristiq\n\nAI Automates Feedback Process\n\nAI has been a game-changer for Brokee in scaling our platform effectively. One example is how we\u2019ve integrated AI to automate the feedback process for our technical assessments. Instead of hiring additional team members to manually review every submission, our AI-driven system evaluates candidates\u2019 performance, generates personalized feedback, and even suggests tailored follow-up questions for hiring managers.\n\nThis automation not only ensures consistency and fairness but also allows us to handle significantly more users without compromising quality. By removing the bottleneck of manual evaluation, we\u2019ve been able to onboard more companies and engineers simultaneously, supporting our growth and expanding our impact in the hiring space. AI has made scaling not just possible but seamless.\n\nMaksym Lushpenko, Founder, Brokee\n\nAI Levels the Playing Field\n\nAI technologies have been an amazing tool to level-set startups, especially given their low cost of implementation.\n\nnDash is a bootstrapped company that often competes with brands well-funded by VCs. Integrations like OpenAI\u2019s API have enabled us to offer similar services and features without the added cost of capital.\n\nMachine learning was once accessible only to a few companies and has since been all but commoditized. We can now run powerful computations against large datasets that were all but impossible a few years ago. The biggest challenge is now just identifying implementations of value to content marketers and dreaming up the user interface.\n\nMatt Solar, Cofounder & VP of Marketing, nDash Marketing\n\nAI Transforms Customer Support\n\nIn my role at Windsor Drake, I once worked with a startup struggling to scale its customer support as their user base expanded rapidly. They were overwhelmed with routine Level 1 inquiries, and hiring more staff to keep up was becoming unsustainable. To address this, they integrated an AI-driven chatbot alongside cutting-edge voice AI technology to handle Level 1 customer requests. The voice AI, in particular, delivered human-like interactions that customers found surprisingly natural and well-received.\n\nThe impact was transformative. By automating Level 1 support, the startup freed up significant resources to focus on Level 2 and Level 3 support, where human expertise and problem-solving were crucial. This allowed them to address complex customer issues faster, improve overall service quality, and strengthen client relationships without increasing operational costs.\n\nWhat stood out most was how capital-efficient this solution was. Startups often face tight budgets, and this AI integration allowed them to scale customer service without burning through resources. For software startups especially, where customer satisfaction can make or break growth, leveraging AI for customer support isn\u2019t just a nice-to-have\u2014it\u2019s becoming a competitive necessity. The combination of cost-efficiency, scalability, and customer approval makes this a game-changing development that startups should actively explore.\n\nJeff Barrington, Managing Director, Windsor Drake\n\nAI Increases Marketing Scalability\n\nThe integration of AI technologies has dramatically increased the scalability of startups, particularly in marketing. Where previously a five-person team might have been necessary, many tasks can now be efficiently handled by a single individual, thanks to AI-powered tools.\n\nThis shift is particularly impactful for bootstrapped businesses, as it allows them to scale more profitably with less need for large teams or significant investment. AI enables startups to operate lean while still achieving impressive results.\n\nA concrete example from my experience is in email marketing. We used AI tools like Claude.ai to craft highly optimized onboarding sequences aimed at converting sign-ups into active clients. This whole process took about 2 hours, whereas previously this would have taken weeks. The quality of the AI-generated content was exceptional, and it significantly boosted our conversion rate from 30% to 38%.\n\nThis is just one instance of how AI can drive tangible improvements. Similar efficiencies can be found across various marketing functions, from content creation to data analysis and campaign optimization.\n\nStartups can now achieve the output and quality of much larger teams, allowing them to compete more effectively and scale more rapidly without proportional increases in headcount or costs.\n\nTom Van den Heuvel, CMO, wetracked.io\n\nAI Enables Unbelievable Automation\n\nThere is nothing that has improved our ability to scale startups like AI. You can write a Python script for any task, we have MCP setups (Model Context Protocol) that can access apps and programs on your Mac/PC to perform a plethora of tasks. It\u2019s really unbelievable. You just think of what you want automated and AI will make it happen. Sam Altman of OpenAI says we may see the first billionaire solo entrepreneur due to AI. Exciting times.\n\nNader Jaber, Founder, FlyNumber\n\nAI Optimizes Operational Efficiency\n\nThe integration of AI technologies plays a pivotal role in enabling startups to scale by optimizing operational efficiency and fortifying cybersecurity measures. It can also be used to automate routine processes and proactively address potential challenges. For businesses, this means reducing manual workload, improving resource allocation, and ensuring a secure foundation for growth. AI also enhances real-time decision-making by providing actionable insights from data, which is critical for scaling operations effectively without overburdening resources.\n\nAt GO Technology Group, we worked with an industrial manufacturing client in Chicago to implement an AI-enhanced cybersecurity solution that monitored their network 24/7 for anomalies. This allowed the organization to detect and respond to threats in real time, preventing potential breaches and downtime. The integration of AI not only streamlined their security operations but also freed up IT staff to focus on strategic initiatives, demonstrating how AI-powered managed IT services can drive both scalability and resilience in startup environments.\n\nSteve Robinson, Senior Technical Manager, Go Technology Group\n\nAI Drives Adaptive Pricing Models\n\nOne way AI drives scalability is through adaptive pricing models. I\u2019m not strictly talking about automating price changes but using AI to dynamically respond to market conditions, customer behavior, and inventory levels in real time, creating a competitive edge that startups often overlook.\n\nFor example, I worked with a SaaS startup that used AI to analyze customer segments, competitors\u2019 pricing, and seasonal demand patterns. Other than optimizing pricing for revenue, the system adapted to prioritize user acquisition in low-demand periods while maximizing revenue during peak times.\n\nDuring a major product launch, the AI model identified that a slightly lower introductory price for one user segment (freelancers) drove a 25% higher conversion rate while maintaining profitability because of the predicted long-term subscription retention. For larger enterprise clients, the AI suggested bundling features with tiered pricing, increasing adoption by 18% compared to static pricing.\n\nWhen you allow AI to continuously refine pricing, you can reduce churn rates and optimize customer acquisition costs, all without needing a massive pricing team or constant manual analysis. I\u2019d say you must explore adaptive pricing AI early. It\u2019s a strategic lever that can simultaneously improve margins and customer loyalty in ways static strategies simply can\u2019t.\n\nAljay Ambos, Lead SEO & Marketing Consultant, Twixify\n\nRelated Articles"

            "article_content": "Digital Insurance contacted insurance professionals to comment on cybersecurity trends for 2025.\n\nThe experts suggest generative AI, regulations and cyber insurance will all play a role in cybersecurity next year.\n\nResponses have been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nSteve Durbin, Chief Executive, Information Security Forum\n\nSteve Durbin\n\nRolling into 2025, we expect increasingly sophisticated cyber incidents, especially in the area of AI-fueled phishing and synthetic media (deepfake) campaigns leading to higher probability of ransomware recovery efforts. Organizations will increasingly prioritize cyber resilience, prioritize business continuity planning and policies that will include surviving cyberattacks without readily available access to computer systems and networks.\n\nExpect a sharper focus on embedding meaningful risk mitigations in the corporate DNA including crucial threat preparedness measures needed to attain peace of mind and operational stability for countering the general malaise felt in boardrooms and on Main Street against a backdrop of continuing geopolitical unrest.\n\nMichelle Drolet, CEO of Towerwall\n\nMichelle Drolet Towerwall\n\nIn 2025, businesses accepting credit card or digital wallet payments will need to meet the PCI DSS 4.0 compliance requirements by March or risk hefty fines and penalties.\n\nKey measures include deploying web application firewalls, enhancing anti-phishing tools, implementing multi-factor authentication, using a minimum of 12-character passwords, and leveraging automated log analysis tools like SIEM to safeguard data. These steps will be crucial for protecting customer information and maintaining security integrity.\n\nPaul Handy, global head of cyber, Crawford Global Technical Services\n\nPaul Handy\n\nWe will see a broadening of differentiation between solutions and products for the large and mid to small cyber markets in 2025, aligned to a greater understanding and approach to managing cyber risk. Almost all larger organizations now have business continuity arrangements that address cyber risk, often including expert retainer solutions, and the main insurance driver for these organizations is the cover available and the cost of risk transfer, rather than on value-added services or embedded tooling to help improve and manage risk.\n\nFor the SME space, however, we will continue to see the development of managed risk solutions, and more 'off the shelf' or localized products with stricter terms and imposed response or claims models.\n\nAlvito Vaz, business manager for ID Federation\n\nAlvito Vaz\n\nIn 2025, agent-carrier connectivity will continue to get more difficult as carriers continue to implement multi-factor authentication. Today most agents use MFA six or more times each day and that will double as regulatory changes mandate MFA for all external connections.\n\nAgents need to work with carrier partners to have secure connections with operational efficiency.\n\nRichard DePiero, EVP- head of Sompo Pro, Sompo, North America\n\nRichard DePiero\n\nDespite industry focus on large catastrophic cyber events, 2024 brought quite a few mini catastrophic (mini cats) events and smaller supply chain interruptions, with examples of Change Healthcare, CDK, Crowdstrike, and Snowflake, among others. The loss/claims from these events have been slow to materialize, but as they mature in 2025, they are expected to cause greater losses than anticipated by many.\n\nAt the same time, we can expect these mini cat events will continue to occur, particularly impacting insurance portfolios that are concentrated in affected industries.\n\nAndy Logani, chief digital officer at EXL\n\nAndy Logani\n\nThe evolving landscape of cyber threats and regulatory requirements is pushing organizations to rethink their cybersecurity strategies. CISOs now face heightened expectations, especially with new reporting mandates. Public companies are required to annually report on their cybersecurity risk processes in SEC Form 10-K filings, detailing how they assess, identify, and manage material risks, alongside the board's oversight role. Additionally, the requirement to disclose material cybersecurity incidents within four days via Form 8-K has increased the pressure for faster, more transparent responses to breaches.\n\nAs organizations strive to meet these new regulatory demands, Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming pivotal in addressing cybersecurity challenges. AI will increasingly be used to simulate cyber incidents, identify vulnerabilities, and provide automated incident response guidance, all of which enhance the speed and accuracy of threat mitigation. These innovations are essential in a landscape where faster responses are crucial due to heightened regulatory oversight.\n\nThe SEC's regulations have introduced significant challenges for CISOs, particularly in determining the materiality of cyber incidents and ensuring accurate disclosures. Transparency is critical, but this also heightens the risk of legal scrutiny. CISOs now face the possibility of personal liability if privacy violations or cybersecurity failures occur under their watch, underscoring the need for meticulous documentation and robust internal controls. The recent breaches at Uber and SolarWinds are stark reminders of the personal and financial consequences CISOs can face if things go wrong.\n\nThe global cyber insurance market is expected to reach $20 billion by 2025. The rise in regulatory pressure is driving organizations to rethink their approach to cyber insurance. With incidents needing to be disclosed more rapidly and accurately, CISOs must ensure that their security practices align with the terms of their insurance policies. This alignment can prevent coverage denials and ensure organizations are financially protected against emerging threats.\n\nOne of the most exciting advancements is the ability of Generative AI to simulate sophisticated social engineering attacks, improving insurers' capacity to assess and price risks associated with human vulnerabilities. These simulations can also enhance employee training, raising awareness about common tactics used in phishing and other social engineering schemes. Furthermore, the use of synthetic data to model cyber risks will address the current shortage of historical data, allowing insurers to create more accurate risk models and make better underwriting decisions.\n\nReshma Budhwani, chief technology security officer, New York Life\n\nReshma Budhwani\n\nIn 2025, establishing trust and authenticity for both individuals and digital identities will be increasingly challenging due to advanced AI generating convincing fake audio and video, alongside sophisticated social engineering tactics. This will complicate the detection of deepfakes and the prevention of impersonation and fraud, necessitating organizations to invest in continuous, context-aware identity and transaction validation systems.\n\nIn addition, with the rise in frequency and complexity of cyber threats, cyber insurers will likely reassess coverage terms, compelling organizations seeking cyber insurance to adopt resilient practices. These practices might include developing sophisticated incident response plans, investing in advanced cybersecurity technologies, and conducting regular security audits to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with evolving standards.\n\nFurthermore, due to ongoing geopolitical activities, the impact of supply chain disruptions will persist. Companies will need to enhance their supply chain resilience by diversifying suppliers and leveraging technology for better supply chain visibility and risk assessment.\n\nBen Duffy, vice president, head of North America, KYND\n\nBen Duffy\n\nAs we look toward 2025, the rise in zero-day vulnerabilities will continue to pose significant exposure risks for cyber insurers, particularly in industries heavily reliant on common software and technology platforms. The increasing frequency and sophistication of these threats underscore the urgent need for real-time data and advanced modeling to accurately assess and manage risk accumulation. Now more than ever, underwriters must evolve their cyber risk management strategy while fostering strong, adaptive collaboration with reinsurers and the insurance-linked securities markets to effectively mitigate potential losses and safeguard their portfolios.\n\nTodd Greenbaum, CEO of Input 1\n\nTodd Greenbaum\n\nFor too long, cybersecurity has been viewed as a necessary expense. But innovative carriers are rethinking the narrative, turning cybersecurity investments into customer-focused growth opportunities. Real-time threat detection systems are evolving to not only protect customer data but proactively identify and mitigate risks like fraud or identify theft.\n\nMeanwhile blockchain technology is moving from theory to practice, enabling instant claims validation and creating new servicing models that enhance trust. The result? A shift from reactive protection to proactive customer engagement, unlocking fresh revenue streams through premium digital services that meet the demands of a connected world.\n\nJack Kudale, CEO of Cowbell\n\nJack Kudale\n\nCybersecurity practices are likely to continue emphasizing prevention. The focus is shifting from reactive measures after an attack, including response and recovery, to proactive measures to prevent incidents before they occur.\n\nCyber insurance players will follow this trend by also focusing on helping to support businesses with insight and education that enables the implementation of better prevention, rather than relying on a responsive approach.\n\nGood practice: Brokers should ask their cyber insurance partners what they offer in terms of cyber risk assessment and mitigation tools. These resources can help their clients strengthen cyber resilience and remain focused on proactive cybersecurity measures.\n\nThe exponential growth of AI will inevitably lead to the potential for more AI-generated attacks, with actors currently developing AI tools built for hacking. As AI engines continue to develop, threat actors will become more sophisticated and capable of more complex attacks.\n\nAdded to this, the sophistication of the technology's use in AI-based deception is likely to grow. We have already seen stories hit mainstream news, where senior decision-makers have been duped into transferring funds through fabricated representations of video conference call participants. As digitally produced visual representations are constantly improving, businesses need to be more vigilant as deepfakes are becoming harder to spot.\n\nGood practice: Brokers should help their clients understand the shift in sophistication of cyberattacks, and recommend mitigation measures such as cybersecurity awareness training for employees.\n\nQuantum computing is likely to continue to be a significant and topical issue for 2025. However, in cybersecurity, advances in this technology could see us in a situation where current encryption methods are rendered obsolete. At the tipping point when this happens, we will see a rush to develop quantum encryption services.\n\nGood practice: Quantum computing technology may be inaccessible for most small and medium-sized businesses. However, these organizations can still enhance data security by adding layers to their existing security practices.\n\nThe current geo-political landscape is unstable and features a growing number of overt and covert conflicts. These conflicts are also training grounds for new cyber tools, malware, etc. These emerging tools could be used by other actors against other targets, leading to an influx of new cyber threats.\n\nColeman Johnson, SVP, chief underwriting officer at The Mutual Group\n\nColeman Johnson\n\nCybersecurity and protection for incidents will remain a growing concern for companies of all sizes. Cyber insurance rates are coming down for most companies as the market has stabilized a bit.\n\nUnderwriters remain diligent in requiring quality of controls like MFA, EDR, and employee training on issues like social engineering for example. Regulatory scrutiny is ramping up on how companies protect data and their use of AI and biometric data.\n\nAs more companies realize the full impact a cyber incident can have on their reputation and business continuity, they won't just want insurance, they'll want a company with top-tier incident response to quickly resolve the issue, get their business back up and running, and minimize any collateral fallout.\n\nJohn Roberts, general manager - security, Coalition\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nMSPs and cyber-insureds will start to feel the impact of relaxed underwriting practices during the soft market. Some cyber insurance providers have relaxed their underwriting rules in the soft market to help bolster their GWP. While it may have positive returns in the short-term, insurers who look past a lack of controls avoid important conversations with companies and their MSPs that raise cybersecurity standards. This will lead to more costly incidents because more lax underwriting leads to more lax security practices from their customers.\n\nIn 2025, the cyber insurance industry will need to focus on helping businesses get back to cyber basics, including enforcing MFA, instituting email protections, and more.\n\nTim Francis, enterprise cyber lead at Travelers\n\nTim Francis\n\nIt's difficult to predict what might be coming in the future, especially in the always-evolving world of cyberattacks. Criminals are constantly looking for ways to infiltrate a company's computer network, access sensitive data and then monetize those actions. As a cyber insurance carrier, it's our job to be aware of these different methods, especially new ones, and help our customers position themselves for success by reducing their chances of becoming a victim of cybercrime.\n\nRansomware has been and will continue to be a serious threat to businesses. Recently, more cyber criminals are engaging in double extortion, where they not only encrypt a company's computer system to make it inoperable, but they steal sensitive data and threaten to publicize it, demanding money from the victimized company to make both problems go away.\n\nNo matter what the cybersecurity risks are \u2013 ransomware, data breach, business email compromise, phishing, smishing, even deep fakes \u2013 companies would be wise to work with specialists who can help address any network vulnerabilities. Taking smart, necessary steps will allow any business to be as prepared as possible in the fight against new and existing cyber threats.\n\nEric Boateng, CISO and head of enterprise cybersecurity, MassMutual\n\nEric Boateng\n\nIn 2025, we will see pure risk management practices baked into cybersecurity programs to ensure alignment of cyber risk mitigation strategies with business goals, and to protect the organization and its customers from current and external cybersecurity threats.\n\nThe convergence of risk management will also allow CISOs to communicate effectively with board members on their company's cyber risk management strategy, while also explaining how this strategy is enabling the business to achieve its objectives.\n\nJust as importantly, cyber risk management will also enable cyber leaders to proactively identify, measure, manage, monitor and report cyber risk on an ongoing basis. A data driven, cyber risk management program will be a next generation approach for strengthening the control environment and staying competitive and cyber resilient in the new year.\n\nTodd Lukens, chief technology and information security officer, Nationwide\n\nTodd Lukens\n\nWith the rapid advancements in AI, threat actors are now able to expedite their tactics, techniques, and procedures, such as developing new code to exploit vulnerabilities.\n\nThis evolution in AI technology is also leading to more sophisticated social engineering, deepfakes, digital fraud, and identity compromise, posing significant challenges to cybersecurity.\n\nRohit Makhijani, principal analyst, Forrester\n\nRohit Makhijani\n\nAs cyber threats grow in a highly digitalized and connected world, the insurance industry will sharpen focus on it. They are likely to expand their offerings to include more nuanced, customized cyber security policies, tailored to specific risk profile and industry sectors.\n\nInsurers will also implement advanced cyber risk assessment tools powered by AI.\n\nMandeep Gosal, VP global professional services, Beazley Security\n\nMandeep Gosal\n\nIdentity security is set to play an even more pivotal role in 2025, driven by the proliferation of \"reverse identity theft\" and exposure of concealed privilege pathways. While Zero Trust principles, centred on identity verification and 'never trust, always verify', have been established for decades, they remain challenging for enterprises to adopt and implement. This is largely due to their complexity and the significant investment required in both technology and training.\n\nThreat actors will continue to exploit obscure identity pathways that grant privileged access. Cybercriminals are set to shift their focus from endpoints, where visibility has improved, to less monitored areas including network appliances like VPNs and firewalls. Here, visibility is scant, making them prime targets for attack. The exploitation of newly discovered security flaws, known as zero-day vulnerabilities, in these systems is expected to rise sharply, as evidenced by incidents reported by Mandiant in 2023. Additionally, attackers are likely to weaponize known vulnerabilities, referred to as n-days, with greater speed, exploiting these known issues before organizations can patch them.\n\nIncreasingly, attackers are combining stolen data and credentials with additional personal information to craft false digital identities. It is vital for organisations to identify the blind spots in their IT environments through understanding their assets, risk posture and potential threats to remove opportunities for malicious actors to cause serious disruption. Businesses that implement pre-emptive, responsive, and adaptive solutions to cyber risk strategies - enhanced through continuous staff training, robust hygiene practices and a re-evaluation of Zero Trust Models \u2013 can confidently pursue their strategies without being hindered by unmanaged risks.\n\nBrandon Welch, director of cyber services, Western Region, Beazley Security\n\nBrandon Welch\n\nAs widespread adoption of AI continues to grow in 2025, we can expect to see an increase in privacy and security incidents that are attributable to misconfigured and misunderstood systems.\n\nIn a sprint to use AI systems and gain an edge over competitors, organizations will unintentionally open themselves to security incidents and create privacy incidents. Several factors will contribute to these events, including misconfiguration of AI systems and misunderstanding of their actual impact and sensitivity. In addition, we will increasingly see general issues stemming from AI Exceptionalism, such as overestimating AI's capabilities and failure to fully accept or address its limitations.\n\nTo combat these issues, organizations must take steps to understand what constitutes an AI problem and, if it is determined that they have one, what level of due diligence and human interaction are required to address the issue. Additionally, organizations should have an AI Focused Incident Response Plan in place that clearly delineates the steps to take when an AI system creates unintended security or privacy issues.\n\nBob Wice, head of underwriting management, cyber & tech, Beazley\n\nBrandon Welch\n\nHigh profile outages arising from a faulty update from CrowdStrike and a ransomware attack on Change Healthcare were a stark reminder in 2024 that a single point of failure can cripple organizations and cause major economic damage, whether the outages are malicious or unintentional. But some of the biggest risks that businesses face in the coming year may well come from within their own organizations if they are not alert to the dangers of tech obsolescence.\n\nWhile new technologies and capabilities are introduced every day, many companies are still using legacy systems, simply because they still work and replacing them can be costly. But this lack of basic risk management around tech obsolescence is causing more and more problems for companies. Beazley's Risk & Resilience research revealed that 27% of business leaders are concerned about tech obsolescence risk in the face of new technologies (such as AI) and that number is expected to rise in 2025.\n\nPressure to address risks inherent in legacy systems will also come from external sources. We expect increased regulatory scrutiny concerning end-of-life and end-of-support software and devices including the Office of Civil Rights in the healthcare sector.\n\nInnovation is moving at a rapid pace, and with innovation comes risk. Businesses must develop a plan to protect themselves against these evolving challenges.\n\nAbhishek Madhok, EY Americas insurance cybersecurity leader\n\nAbhishek Madhok\n\nA key focus for cyber risk management in the year ahead is managing ecosystem risks. As organizations increasingly rely on technology and critical business services ecosystems, they face challenges due to the lack of visibility into third-party security infrastructure and data flows. Threat actors are exploiting these vulnerabilities and targeting the interconnected network of businesses, including partners, suppliers and customers. To be cyber ready in this environment requires comprehensive planning around recovery and response in the event that one entity is compromised.\n\nQuestions that organizations should consider include:\n\n\n\nWhat is the business risk?\n\nHow do you build resiliency and security around it?\n\nWhat is your strategy to protect your business and customers while managing the process with transparency?\n\nFraud-related losses also continue to grow in the insurance industry. With increased digitization, online fraud conducted through account takeovers and synthetic identities have led to multi-million-dollar losses. While emerging technologies such as AI can facilitate attacks by threat actors, they also present an opportunity to improve the speed and scale of defense. Historically the insurance sector has been slow to modernize. But we're now seeing a move to embrace new technologies. By capitalizing on technological advancements and melding their technology and cyber investments, insurance organizations can significantly strengthen cyber risk posture."

It feels like early days for both of those, though I can\u2019t say either have felt like a genuine success.\n\nAnd yet, there were lots of Apple products peppered throughout the year that live up to the company\u2019s high reputation of quality. As you\u2019ll notice, these definitely fall in line with the more established products in Apple\u2019s ecosystem. But that doesn\u2019t take anything away from just how good these were and how much they impressed our team of reviewers here at Digital Trends.\n\nMac mini (M4)\n\nChris Hagan / Digital Trends\n\nThe Mac mini has long been an ignored product in Apple\u2019s lineup, despite being the most affordable Mac you can buy. It had used more or less the same design for over a decade, despite the bumps to performance in the Apple Silicon era.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in 2024, the Mac mini became impossible to ignore. Not only did the redesign make it more compact, it also received the bump to 16GB as a starting RAM configuration without increasing the price. This is a huge deal for a mini PC that was already so affordable. There\u2019s simply no value in the world of computers quite like the base configuration of the M4 Mac mini right now. It\u2019s not perfect \u2014 the placement of the power button is silly and the storage configuration prices get a bit insane. But as a base, there\u2019s just never been a mini PC or Mac of any kind quite like it.\n\nBuy at Amazon\n\nAirPods 4 with ANC\n\nSimon Cohen / Digital Trends\n\nApple launched the AirPods 4 alongside its new iPhone, but also launched an interesting secondary model, eloquently named AirPods 4 with ANC (Active Noise Cancellation). Originally a feature exclusive to the AirPods Pro, you can now get ANC in AirPods for just $179 compared to the $249 of the AirPods Pro 2. The main difference, however, is that it doesn\u2019t include ear tips. Though the sound quality won\u2019t ever be immersive \u2014 especially for all ears \u2014 if ear tips bother you (or gross you out), this is a great way to go.\n\nIn our review of both pairs of wireless earbuds, we noted that the base AirPods 4 \u201cdo sound better than the previous generation,\u201d and that the ANC model \u201csound even better by nature of the fact that they so successfully remove outside sounds from the sonic canvas.\u201d And to sum things up: \u201cThere is no better ANC in an open-ear earbud.\u201d That\u2019s quite a ringing endorsement from our audio experts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuy at Amazon\n\niPhone 16\n\nJoe Maring / Digital Trends\n\nMuch has been said about the current status of the iPhone and its now very complicated and nuanced lineup. But among all the higher-end options available, our phone reviewers were most impressed by the base iPhone 16. It lacks all the bells and whistles of the Pro and Pro Max models, of course, but for a $799 phone, it\u2019s probably the iPhone most people should be upgrading to this year. The tweaked design, punctuated by the new color options, really make this stand out compared to previous models, too.\n\nOur reviewer, Joe Maring, was really taken aback by the new colors and redesigned camera module on the back, so much so that he says the following: \u201cIt still looks like an iPhone, but there\u2019s enough new here that it feels fresh and exciting in a way the iPhone 16 Pro does not.\u201d The 60Hz refresh rate feels a little old-school, as does the lack of an always-on display.\n\nBut it\u2019s great to see Apple ensure that its most affordable iPhone (outside the iPhone SE) really feels like something new. In 2024, that\u2019s really saying something.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuy at Apple\n\niPad mini (7th-generation)\n\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there\u2019s one product category that Apple unequivocally owns, it\u2019s the small tablet. There are hardly any players left in the game, and that\u2019s largely because of just how good the $499 iPad mini really is. It\u2019s not trying to replace your MacBook, but it\u2019s the perfect travel companion or couch device. In 2024, that hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 it\u2019s just gotten better.\n\nIn our review, we wrote about just how perfect the form factor is, paired with the silky smooth performance of the A17 Pro chip. Yes, Apple Intelligence features still feel half-baked, but that doesn\u2019t change just how fantastic a device the iPad mini still is, now in its 7th generation.\n\nIt still has some of the problems with the older iPad design, whether that\u2019s the awkward webcam placement, the lack of a headphone jack, and the not-quite-bright-enough display. And yet, it\u2019s a great example of just how good Apple\u2019s refinements to this under-appreciated product category really have become.\n\nBuy at Amazon\n\nMacBook Pro (M4)\n\nChris Hagan / Digital Trends\n\nBringing the M4 to the MacBook Pro didn\u2019t feel like a revelation. We knew it would happen, and it played out very much how we assumed it would, adding a more powerful Neural Engine and significant boost to CPU and GPU performance over the M3.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhat we didn\u2019t expect, however, was the other changes Apple had up its sleeve. For the first time since its launch, the M4 MacBook Pro feels like a really good option, so much so that it successfully undercuts the 15-inch MacBook Air. The most important upgrade is the bump to 16GB of RAM, which finally makes this the \u201cPro\u201d device it deserves to be. Add in the option for the really awesome nano-texture display that deflects glare, and you\u2019ve got the makings of a very solid generational upgrade. The M4 Pro and M4 Max continue to startle with how much GPU performance they\u2019re able to scale up, as always, but the improvement to the 14-inch M4 model really were the most impressive this time around.\n\nBuy at Amazon\n\niPad Pro (M4)\n\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\n\nSet all the debates aside about the direction of the iPad Pro and the future of how it compares with MacBooks. Taken on its own, the M4 iPad Pro is just an immaculate tech product. Apple made a lot of small tweaks to improve the design this time around, whether it\u2019s changing the position of the webcam for better video calls or just squeezing an insane amount of performance in with the M4.\n\nThrow in the insanely bright and vivid tandem OLED display \u2014 a feature still missing from MacBook Pros \u2014 and you see how much Apple is able to juice up its iPads with breakthrough technology. According to our testing in the review, the new display tech not only improved image quality but also helped with battery life. Our reviewer boldly called it \u201cthe best tablet ever I\u2019ve ever used.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile it hasn\u2019t quite arrived, it feels easier than ever to replace a basic laptop or MacBook Air with an iPad Pro, and that\u2019s thanks to just how incredible the hardware is. We\u2019ll keep waiting on the software to catch up, but that doesn\u2019t take anything away from just how good this year\u2019s iPad Pro update was.\n\nBuy at Best Buy"

            "article_content": "Managing expenses effectively is crucial to maintaining financial integrity. However, the rise in fraudulent expense claims poses a significant challenge for organizations worldwide. Fraudulent activities not only drain resources but also damage trust within the workplace. Detecting such fraud manually can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. This is where machine learning comes into play, offering innovative ways to combat expense fraud efficiently and proactively.\n\nWhat Is Expense Fraud?\n\nExpense fraud refers to the act of submitting false or exaggerated claims for reimbursement. Employees may manipulate receipts, inflate mileage claims, or create fake invoices to gain undeserved compensation. Common examples of expense fraud include:\n\nSubmitting personal expenses as business-related costs.\n\nAltering the amounts on genuine receipts.\n\nCreating entirely fictitious receipts or invoices.\n\nReimbursing duplicate claims for the same expense.\n\nThese fraudulent activities can cost businesses thousands, if not millions, of dollars annually. While traditional audits can uncover some discrepancies, they often miss more sophisticated schemes. This highlights the need for advanced technologies like machine learning to tackle fraud more effectively.\n\nThe Role of Machine Learning in Fraud Detection\n\nMachine learning (ML) leverages algorithms that analyze data, learn patterns, and make predictions. Unlike rule-based systems, ML models continuously improve over time as they process new data. In the context of expense fraud detection, machine learning offers the following advantages:\n\nAutomated Data Analysis: ML systems can process vast amounts of expense data in real time, identifying anomalies that may signal fraudulent behavior.\n\nPattern Recognition: By analyzing historical data, machine learning models can detect unusual patterns that deviate from normal expense behaviors.\n\nRisk Scoring: ML algorithms assign risk scores to expense claims, flagging those with high likelihoods of fraud for further review.\n\nAdaptive Learning: As fraud tactics evolve, machine learning models adapt by learning new patterns and identifying emerging threats.\n\nKey Machine Learning Techniques for Expense Fraud Detection\n\nMachine learning employs various techniques to identify fraudulent expense claims. Below are some of the most commonly used approaches:\n\nSupervised Learning\n\nSupervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the outcomes (fraudulent or non-fraudulent) are already known. The model learns to classify new expense claims based on the patterns it observes in the training data. Algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks are commonly used in supervised learning for fraud detection.\n\nUnsupervised Learning\n\nUnlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. This approach is ideal for detecting unknown types of fraud. Techniques like clustering and anomaly detection help group similar data points and identify outliers. For instance, if an employee\u2019s expense claim is significantly higher than their peers\u2019, the system flags it for investigation.\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nNatural language processing is used to analyze text-based data, such as descriptions in expense claims. NLP can identify inconsistencies, suspicious keywords, or unusual phrasing that may indicate fraudulent intent.\n\nReinforcement Learning\n\nReinforcement learning involves training models through a reward-based system. In fraud detection, the algorithm receives rewards for accurately identifying fraudulent claims and penalties for false positives or negatives. This iterative process improves the model\u2019s accuracy over time.\n\nBuilding an Effective Machine Learning Framework for Fraud Detection\n\nImplementing a machine learning-based expense fraud detection system requires careful planning and execution. Below are the critical steps:\n\nData Collection and Preprocessing\n\nThe first step is gathering expense-related data, such as receipts, invoices, and transaction records. Preprocessing this data is crucial to ensure accuracy and consistency. Steps include:\n\nCleaning and removing duplicate entries.\n\nConverting unstructured data into structured formats.\n\nNormalizing numerical data for better model performance.\n\nFeature Engineering\n\nFeature engineering involves selecting and creating relevant variables (features) that help the model identify fraud. Examples include:\n\nFrequency of claims per employee.\n\nAverage claim amount by department.\n\nExpense categories with unusually high costs.\n\nModel Training and Testing\n\nOnce features are defined, the next step is training machine learning models. A portion of the data is used for training, while the rest is reserved for testing. This ensures that the model performs well on unseen data.\n\nDeployment and Monitoring\n\nAfter successful testing, the model is deployed to monitor expense claims in real-time. Continuous monitoring and periodic retraining are essential to maintain effectiveness and adapt to new fraud patterns.\n\nChallenges in Machine Learning-Based Fraud Detection\n\nWhile machine learning offers powerful tools for expense fraud detection, it is not without challenges. Some common obstacles include:\n\nData Quality Issues: Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to unreliable model predictions.\n\nHigh False Positives: Over-sensitive models may flag legitimate claims as fraudulent, leading to inefficiencies.\n\nEvolving Fraud Tactics: Fraudsters continuously adapt, requiring models to be updated regularly.\n\nPrivacy Concerns: Handling sensitive financial data necessitates strict adherence to data protection regulations.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a collaborative approach involving robust data governance, regular model audits, and input from domain experts.\n\nBenefits of Machine Learning in Expense Fraud Detection\n\nDespite the challenges, machine learning brings numerous benefits to expense fraud detection:\n\nEfficiency: Automating fraud detection reduces the manual workload, allowing finance teams to focus on high-priority tasks.\n\nAccuracy: ML models often outperform traditional methods, identifying subtle patterns that humans might miss.\n\nScalability: Machine learning systems can handle large volumes of data, making them suitable for organizations of all sizes.\n\nCost Savings: By preventing fraud, businesses can save significant amounts of money that would otherwise be lost.\n\nReal-World Applications of Machine Learning in Expense Fraud Detection\n\nMany organizations have successfully implemented machine learning to combat expense fraud. For instance:\n\nCorporate Finance Departments: Large corporations use ML tools to monitor employee expense reports, flagging anomalies in real-time.\n\nExpense Management Software: Companies like Expensify and Concur integrate machine learning algorithms to provide fraud detection features for their clients.\n\nFinancial Institutions: Banks and credit card companies employ ML models to detect suspicious transactions that could indicate fraudulent expense claims.\n\nConclusion\n\nExpense fraud is a pressing issue that requires proactive measures to mitigate its impact on businesses. Machine learning offers a transformative solution, enabling organizations to detect and prevent fraud with unprecedented efficiency.Furthermore, By leveraging techniques like supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning, companies can build robust fraud detection systems that evolve alongside emerging threats. Although challenges remain, the benefits of machine learning far outweigh the drawbacks, making it an indispensable tool in the fight against expense fraud. Organizations that invest in this technology not only safeguard their finances but also foster a culture of transparency and trust."

PHOTO: AFP\n\nTAIPEI \u2013 A new board game set against the backdrop of armed conflict around Taiwan is set to be released in January 2025, amid renewed threats from Beijing, inviting players to participate in an imaginary Chinese invasion 20 years from now.\n\nChina has ramped up military activity close to democratically governed Taiwan in recent years, including massing naval forces around the island in December.\n\nThe new game, titled \u201c2045\u201d, tasks gamers with navigating the troubles of war by using colourful action cards and role-playing characters involved in operations 10 days before a fictional Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\n\nThat includes members of Taiwan\u2019s armed forces, Chinese sleeper agents and pro-China politicians working to sabotage the island\u2019s defence, as well as citizens picking up guns to defend their homeland.\n\nChina claims Taiwan as its own and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s president and his government strongly object to China\u2019s sovereignty claims and say only the island\u2019s people can decide their future.\n\nTaiwanese board game maker Mizo Games started crowdfunding the game in August. Within two-and-a-half-months, the company had received more than nT$4 million (S$170,000) to fund the project.\n\n\u201cIt is not quite peaceful around Taiwan island and the Western Pacific as we speak,\u201d Mr Chang Shao Lian, founder of Mizo Games said at his Taipei office.\n\nMr Chang said he wanted \u201cplayers to feel they want to win and think about what they will do to win\u201d.\n\nThe game, which is also set to go on sale in the United States and Europe later in 2025, has been developed at a time when Taiwan officials have intensified preparations for scenarios including a China conflict.\n\nLast week, Taiwan\u2019s presidential office held its first \u201ctabletop\u201d exercise involving government agencies beyond the armed forces, simulating a military escalation with China.\n\nThe exercise involved scenarios, including the island being \u201con the verge of conflict\u201d, to test the readiness of government offices and civil society.\n\nPlayers who participated in a test run of \u201c2045\u201d said they learnt about what might happen in the event of a Chinese invasion, and that they hoped the game could help people understand the implications of a war.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not very knowledgeable on military matters, therefore through this game I learnt about where the army may land and launch an attack,\u201d said Mr Kalin Lai, a 23-year-old who tried out the game.\n\nMizo has previously created two other Taiwan war-themed board games \u2013 one about surviving an air raid in Taipei and the other about a bombing in Kaohsiung during Japan\u2019s colonisation of the island between 1895 and 1945.

            "article_content": "I still can\u2019t quite believe that I\u2019m using an Arm-powered Windows laptop every day. After more than a decade of trying to make Windows on Arm a reality, Microsoft and Qualcomm finally nailed it this year with Copilot Plus PCs. These new laptops have excellent battery life and great performance \u2014 and the app compatibility issues that have plagued Windows on Arm are mostly a thing of the past (as long as you\u2019re not a gamer). Microsoft wanted 2024 to be \u201cthe year of the AI PC,\u201d but I think it was very much the year of Windows on Arm. If 2024 was anything to go by, 2025 is going to be even bigger for Windows on Arm.\n\nMicrosoft set the stage for the 2024 year of Windows on Arm announcements in January at CES with promises of AI PCs and the first big change to Windows keyboards in 30 years. Laptop manufacturers started putting a Copilot key on keyboards early this year, providing quick access to Microsoft\u2019s AI assistant. While the Copilot experience on Windows has gone through several confusing revisions, it\u2019s still a key I accidentally press and then get frustrated when a Copilot window appears.\n\nAfter the Copilot key was met with a lukewarm reception, Microsoft reignited the Mac vs. PC war a few months later. Inside Microsoft, confidence had gradually been growing throughout the early months of 2024 that it could finally beat Apple\u2019s MacBook Air after falling behind for years. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella unveiled the company\u2019s new Copilot Plus PC devices at a special event in May, setting the stage for a summer of Windows on Arm laptops from every major OEM.\n\nThe processor is the key\n\nThe key to Windows on Arm\u2019s revival this year was Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processors, which were announced in April. They\u2019ve provided the type of performance and power efficiency only previously available with Apple\u2019s MacBooks and challenged Intel and AMD to do better in the x86 space. After much debate over Microsoft\u2019s MacBook Air-beating benchmarks, the reviews rolled in and showed that Windows on Arm was indeed capable of matching and beating Apple\u2019s MacBook Air. Qualcomm even hired the \u201cI\u2019m a Mac\u201d guy to promote Windows on Arm PCs, showing how confident it was in challenging Apple\u2019s laptop dominance.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 is one of the best Windows laptops available right now. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm also worked closely with developers to make key apps compatible, and it\u2019s now very rare to run into an app compatibility issue that can\u2019t be solved by a native Arm64 version or Microsoft\u2019s improved emulator. Even Google, which previously shunned Windows Phone, has created Arm64 versions of Chrome and Google Drive to support Microsoft\u2019s efforts. With developers continually providing native versions of their apps, it makes it a lot easier to switch to a Windows on Arm laptop. The only big exception is gaming, where x86 still reigns supreme for compatibility and performance.\n\nIntel didn\u2019t sit still while all this Windows on Arm hype was occurring, nor AMD. Intel struck back with Lunar Lake at IFA in September, delivering impressive performance and battery life improvements. AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen AI chips are also competing directly with Qualcomm, and both AMD and Intel have the key advantage of game compatibility that Windows on Arm is definitely not ready for.\n\nWhile we\u2019re still waiting for an M4-powered MacBook Air, Apple did refresh its cheapest MacBooks in October with a surprise upgrade to 16GB of RAM. Apple would probably argue it\u2019s related to Apple Intelligence, but the unusual change came months after Copilot Plus PCs launched, with a minimum of 16GB of RAM at price points that challenge the MacBook Air. Apple did manage to squeeze its new M4 chip into the MacBook Pro recently, though, showing that Qualcomm has some ground to make up in 2025.\n\nApple and Microsoft have both been focusing on AI-powered features for laptops this year, and the end results have been underwhelming on both sides. While a lot of the initial Copilot Plus PC buzz was around Windows on Arm, Microsoft also rolled out some Windows AI features on these devices in June.\n\nIncomplete Recall\n\nThe flagship feature was supposed to be Recall, a feature that snapshots mostly everything you do on a laptop and then lets you recall moments or scroll through a timeline of how you\u2019ve used your PC. But because Recall was met with privacy and security concerns, undermining Microsoft\u2019s entire Copilot Plus PC marketing effort, Microsoft was forced to delay Recall several times to improve its security. In fact, it has only recently appeared in test versions of Windows.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Microsoft\u2019s stumbles with Recall will mean the company slows down with its Windows AI efforts. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri recently told me that the very future of Windows is about cloud and AI, so expect a lot more of this in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft is increasingly focusing on Windows AI features like Recall. Image: Microsoft\n\nComing in 2025\n\nNext year will also be a fascinating battle between x86 and Windows on Arm. AMD and Intel are teaming up to fend off Arm-based chips from Qualcomm, and Intel is facing a period of turbulence after ejecting its CEO, facing desktop chip issues, and a wave of layoffs earlier this year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to see 2025 as the year that Windows on Arm continues to eat into the laptop space. A Dell leak revealed Qualcomm is preparing new chips for 2025, and the chip maker has also been rolling out cheaper Arm-based chips to bring laptop prices down. I\u2019d expect we\u2019ll see more of those at CES in January, alongside the usual slew of laptops that set the stage for the year.\n\nThe Dell leak also hinted at Nvidia\u2019s next-gen GPU plans, which now look set for a CES announcement. Leaks suggest we\u2019ll see RTX 50-series desktop GPUs and even the laptop variants, with OEMs rumored to be preparing new models to show at CES. Given the Windows on Arm gaming situation, a new generation of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs could help generate fresh excitement around x86 laptops throughout 2025.\n\nNvidia might also be planning to help the Windows on Arm effort. The chip maker has long been rumored to be planning to launch Arm PC chips as soon as 2025. Nvidia\u2019s expertise in AI chips and gaming could certainly shake up the Windows laptop world and make Windows on Arm even more enticing."

            "article_content": "2024 has been a landmark year in gaming, offering an exceptional range of titles across genres for every type of player. Whether you're a fan of deep narrative-driven RPGs, high-stakes action, or engaging co-op experiences, this year's releases have been nothing short of stellar.\n\nWith some highly anticipated sequels and breakout new IPs, players were treated to a buffet of exciting and immersive worlds. We've selected seven of the most hyped and celebrated releases of the year, each one a defining experience for both seasoned players and newcomers alike.\n\nImage: Square Enix\n\n1. Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth (PS5)\n\nFinal Fantasy VII: Rebirth, released in 2024, continues the retelling of the iconic RPG saga, picking up where the 2020 Remake left off. As the second part of a trilogy, Rebirth takes Cloud and his allies beyond Midgar into the open world of Gaia, offering an immersive experience for both longtime fans and newcomers.\n\nRebirth expands on familiar characters while introducing fresh twists, keeping even veteran players intrigued. The story explores bold, alternative paths while staying true to the emotional core of the original. The combat system, refined from Remake, blends real-time action with tactical command inputs. The ability to switch between characters mid-battle and seamlessly blend magic, melee attacks, and powerful summons creates a dynamic flow that is both challenging and rewarding.\n\nVisually, Rebirth showcases the PS5's power with stunning environments and lifelike character animations that heighten the emotional impact. Square Enix has crafted a modern RPG masterpiece, balancing nostalgia with innovation, making Rebirth both familiar and fresh for all players.\n\nImage: PlayStation Studios\n\n2. Helldivers 2 (PS5, PC)\n\nSet in a universe inspired by Starship Troopers, Helldivers 2 tasks players with defending humanity against an onslaught of alien threats. The game is built around teamwork, with up to four players joining forces to complete missions across hostile planets.\n\nFriendly fire is always enabled, adding a layer of strategic complexity to the chaotic firefights. Players must coordinate their movements and attacks carefully, lest they accidentally wipe out their own squad in the heat of battle. The game's procedurally generated missions ensure that no two playthroughs are alike, keeping the gameplay fresh and unpredictable. One moment, you might be defending a base from a horde of insect-like aliens and the next moment, you're escorting a convoy through a treacherous wasteland.\n\nCombined with a deep progression system, the variety of mission types gives Helldivers 2 immense replayability. Customisation is another area where the game excels. Players can equip their Helldivers with a wide array of weapons, gadgets, and perks which allow gamers different playstyles and tactical approaches.\n\nWhether you prefer to play as a heavy-hitting tank, a stealthy sniper, or a support role, the game offers plenty of options to tailor your loadout to your preferences.\n\nImage: Atlus\n\n3. Metaphor: ReFantazio (PS5, Xbox Series X, PC)\n\nFor fans of Atlus' Persona series, Metaphor: ReFantazio was one of the most anticipated titles of 2024, and it did not disappoint. Taking the signature style of the Persona franchise and applying it to a medieval fantasy setting, Metaphor offers a refreshing twist on the traditional JRPG formula while maintaining the depth and character-driven narratives that Atlus is known for.\n\nSet in a world embroiled in political intrigue and mystical forces, Metaphor: ReFantazio follows a group of protagonists as they navigate a series of personal and political conflicts in a sprawling kingdom. Metaphor places a strong emphasis on character development and social dynamics. Players must build relationships with their allies, make difficult moral choices, and uncover the secrets of their pasts while battling powerful enemies in a turn-based combat system.\n\nThe game's combat is where Metaphor sets itself apart from other JRPGs. It introduces a new strategic layer, allowing players to exploit enemy weaknesses while managing elemental affinities and unique abilities. The blend of magic and medieval weaponry gives combat a dynamic feel, keeping each encounter engaging and tactical.\n\nVisually, Metaphor is a feast for the eyes, with its striking character designs and fluid animations. The game's art direction brings its fantasy world to life, combining gothic architecture with lush forests and eerie dungeons.\n\nImage: Capcom\n\n4. Dragon's Dogma 2 (PS5, Xbox Series X, PC)\n\nDragon's Dogma 2 showcases Capcom's talent for creating immersive, challenging open-world RPGs. Building on the original's cult following, the sequel expands its fantasy world with enhanced visuals, new mechanics, and more freedom to explore.\n\nSet in a vast world of castles, forests, and dungeons, Dragon's Dogma 2 emphasizes player choice and dynamic combat. Players can choose from various 'vocations' like Rogue, Warrior, or Sorcerer, each offering distinct playstyles and deep customisation options. The game's combat system shines, rewarding precision and strategy over simple button-mashing. Players must learn enemy patterns, exploit weaknesses, and use the environment to gain an edge. AI-controlled 'pawn' companions, who adapt to the player's strategies, add further depth to the gameplay.\n\nA standout feature is the 'Dragonsplague' system, where fallen party members may resurrect as enemies under this mysterious force, adding a layer of consequence to battles. With its rich, expansive world and challenging combat, Dragon's Dogma 2 is a must-play for open-world RPG fans, offering both depth and adventure in a beautifully crafted setting.\n\nImage: GameScience\n\n5. Black Myth: Wukong (PS5, Xbox Series X, PC)\n\nOne of the most highly anticipated games of 2024, Wukong has quickly captivated players with its breathtaking visuals and action-packed gameplay. Developed by the Chinese studio Game Science, Wukong is inspired by the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, bringing the legendary Monkey King, Sun Wukong, to life like never before.\n\nIn Wukong, players assume the role of Sun Wukong, a mythical figure with incredible powers, including shapeshifting and wielding the mystical Ruyi Jingu Bang staff. The game's combat system blends martial arts with mystical abilities, offering players the ability to transform into various creatures to gain new powers, essential for both combat and puzzle-solving. The transformation mechanic adds a unique twist, as players must strategically shift forms to tackle powerful enemies or solve complex puzzles.\n\nThe world of Wukong is visually stunning, showcasing advanced graphics that transport players into a mythical version of ancient China. From lush bamboo forests to ancient temples, every environment is meticulously crafted, immersing players in an atmosphere enhanced by realistic lighting, fluid animations, and a dynamic soundtrack.\n\nRich in lore, the game invites players to explore and uncover the deep narrative tied to Chinese mythology, making it a standout title for action RPG enthusiasts.\n\nImage: Wuthering Waves official website\n\n6. Wuthering Waves (PS5, Xbox Series X, PC)\n\nWuthering Waves is an open-world action RPG with a post-apocalyptic setting, blending fast-paced combat with deep storytelling. Developed by Kuro Games, it has drawn comparisons to titles like Genshin Impact but stands out with its darker, more mature narrative and complex character progression.\n\nPlayers explore a sprawling world ravaged by catastrophe, uncovering secrets about humanity's downfall while battling powerful enemies using an innovative combat system. Wuthering Waves allows players to switch between characters mid-battle, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles, giving it a fast and tactical feel. The game also features a rich world filled with hidden lore, side quests, and environmental storytelling, making exploration as rewarding as combat.\n\nFor those who enjoy open-world exploration with deep narratives, Wuthering Waves is a standout in 2024.\n\nImage: Zenless Zone Zero official Facebook page\n\n7. Zenless Zone Zero (PC, PS5)\n\nFrom miHoYo, the creators of Genshin Impact, Zenless Zone Zero is a fast-paced urban fantasy action RPG set in the futuristic city of New Eridu. The game follows the aftermath of a supernatural event that has caused chaos, leaving the world overrun by creatures known as Ethereal. Players assume the role of a 'Proxy', a special operative guiding survivors through perilous dungeons called Hollows.\n\nWhat sets Zenless Zone Zero apart is its combo-driven combat system. Players can chain attacks and switch between characters mid-battle, with each character offering a unique fighting style, ranging from martial arts to futuristic weaponry. The real-time action is fast and fluid, complemented by stunning special effects that elevate the intensity of combat.\n\nThe game's urban setting, filled with neon-lit streets and high-tech architecture, creates a stark contrast to the supernatural elements that haunt the world. The vibrant art style and sleek visuals make the city of New Eridu feel both modern and chaotic, giving the game a distinctive identity."

It\u2019s designed to handle 2x capacity, and is currently managing over ten billion minutes of voice traffic per year . The modular pod design offers remarkable flexibility and enables us to seamlessly integrate additional pods as our subscriber base continues to grow.\n\nUnlimited numbers of new user groups can be added at any time, without the need to take the entire system offline to rebuild databases and add new servers. There are thousands of network application triggers that alert us when a reallocation of resources is required, and the entire system is constantly monitored for any bottlenecks or other blockages.\n\nIn addition, the pod architecture incorporates a virtual chassis deploying a direct-path algorithm that enables multiple individual physical switches to act as one via a high-speed link\u2014they can couple or uncouple depending on system demands. The result is optimal traffic flow, superior flexibility, and instantaneous scalability.\n\nRegardless of system load, the RingCentral platform is robust enough to handle unforeseen spikes in activity. And that capacity is always fully available as we also operate a full-scale laboratory environment offline to thoroughly test any network changes before we roll them out\u2014expansion efforts never affect our customers\u2019 phone service."

            "article_content": "There are a lot of things in the world that we don't quite understand. And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

Police say a woman in New York state was arrested and charged with aggravated driving while intoxicated after an early Saturday morning crash.\n\nOffcials say they were called over reports of a collision near a house. However, the suspect's alleged impairment is what more than likely lead to a big mistake in judgement that caused the crash, according to police.\n\nNew York State Woman Arrested For Alleged DWI After Mistaking Driveway For Road\n\nFinger Lakes 1 is reporting that a 38-year-old woman from Naples, New York was arrested after crashing aa truck early Saturday. The Ontario County Sheriff\u2019s Office says that deputies responded to a report of a property damage accident around 1:22 AM.\n\nSee Also: New York State Man Charged With DWI on E-Bicycle\n\nPolice say the suspect was driving south when she \"mistakenly turned into a private driveway, believing it was a road, and subsequently crashed her truck into a tree near the driveway.\"\n\nDeputies say that they determined the suspect was intoxicated by alcohol during their investigation. The woman was arrested and charged with aggravated driving while intoxicated, issued traffic tickets, and is due back in court at a later date.\n\nSee New York State's 10 Drunkest Counties For 2024 According to County Health Rankings and Roadmaps , in 2024 the counties listed below have the highest rates of excessive alcohol consumption among adults in the state of New York. What is excessive drinking? The CDC defines it as binge drinking (4 or more drinks at a time for a woman/5 or more for a man) and heavy drinking (8 or drinks per week for women/15 or more for men). The percentage below reflects the segment of a county's population that reports excessive alcohol consumption in a 30 day period.

State officials say that they were dispatched by the Broome County 911 Center to a report of a vehicle that drove onto a homeowner's lawn, struck a Japanese tree, and a fence, then left the scene.\n\nSee Also: Police Chase in New York State Ends With Crash in Orchard\n\nState Police say that they were able to locate the suspect's vehicle because there were pieces of the tree still stuck in the grill of the pickup truck.\n\nWhile interviewing the suspect, troopers smelled an odor of an alcoholic beverage and other characteristics associated with impairment. After an investigation, the driver was arrested and later blew a .14%, which is over one and a half times the state's legal BAC level.\n\nThe man was processed, and is due back in court in late January 2025. Police say he was turned over to a sober third party, who hopefully won't crash into anymore trees."

A girl on the trolley drops a bright red ball. To her, the ball falls straight down. But from the platform, you see the ball traverse an arc before hitting the trolley floor. The two of you observe the same event, but from different reference frames: one anchored to the trolley and the other to the platform.\n\nThe idea of reference frames has a storied history in classical physics: Isaac Newton, Galileo, and Albert Einstein all relied on them for their studies of motion. A reference frame is essentially a coordinate system (a way of specifying positions and times relative to some zero point, or \u201corigin\u201d) that might itself be in motion. Einstein used reference frames to develop his theories of relativity, which revealed that space and time are not fixed backdrops to the universe, but rather elastic entities that can stretch, scrunch, and warp.\n\nBut quantum physics has for the most part ignored reference frames. Alice and Bob, the fictional observers in many experiments in quantum physics, typically have different physical locations, but they\u2019re assumed to have a common reference frame. This is now changing. Quantum physicists are realizing that they can\u2019t ignore the fact that the reference frame Alice is anchored to (akin to the trolley or the platform) might have multiple possible locations at once. Or that the clock Bob is using to measure time might be subject to quantum uncertainty.\n\n\u201cIn the quantum world, the reference frames should [also] be described by the formalism of quantum theory,\u201d said Renato Renner, a theoretical physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.\n\nIn a paper this year, the physicist \u010caslav Brukner at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information and the University of Vienna and colleagues showed that quantum reference frames put a new perspective on long-studied quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. The findings lead Renner to suspect that quantum reference frames might help resolve some of the weird paradoxes that arise in quantum thought experiments."

            "article_content": "As the year draws to a close, China has set its sights firmly on the future, with a roadmap laid out during the recently concluded annual Central Economic Work Conference. The focus is clear \u2014 scientific and technological innovation will be the cornerstone of the nation's economic strategy heading into 2025.\n\nThe goal is nothing short of transformative \u2014 to create new quality productive forces and overhaul China's industrial system, building a framework for a modernized, tech-driven economy.\n\nAs a journalist, I find it fascinating to see how the country is positioning itself at the forefront of the next industrial revolution.\n\nWith major technological projects and large-scale demonstrations of new technologies, China is laying the groundwork for fostering new quality productive forces. This initiative, which centers around emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things, promises to dramatically reshape industries across the board.\n\nThe government is keen to foster innovation in emerging sectors, nurturing the industries of the future while ensuring that China maintains its competitive edge in strategic technological areas.\n\nYu Hongjun, former vice-minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, explained that China's push into digital infrastructure is already paying off.\n\nOver the past few years, the country has made major strides in establishing a robust digital economy.\n\nThe widespread adoption of 5G and the development of 6G satellite communication systems have set the stage for what Yu calls a smart, connected economy.\n\nHe said during the World Internet of Things Convention held recently in Beijing that the rise of new IoT, new data and new business models are quietly but powerfully reshaping China's economic landscape. This is the bedrock of the new quality productive forces the country is betting on for long-term success.\n\nAs I dug deeper into the details, I realized the scale of what's unfolding here.\n\nHe Xuming, chairman of the World Internet of Things Convention Executive Committee, said the global digital economy, driven by IoT technologies, is growing at an annual rate of 20 percent. This year, global IoT connections are expected to increase by more than 23 percent to surpass 25 billion.\n\nWhat's even more impressive is that China is leading the charge in IoT infrastructure construction and innovative development in the digital economy.\n\nChina is poised to build over 4.3 million 5G base stations this year, helping to connect over 3 billion IoT devices, said He, adding that the traditional digital economy in China is projected to reach an annual output value of over 70 trillion yuan ($9.59 trillion), growing at a rate of more than 20 percent. With nearly a million companies already operating in the IoT space, the groundwork for China to lead in new quality productive forces is well underway.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing aspect of this push is its potential to trigger the fourth industrial revolution. Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce, said the core of this revolution is the convergence of digital technologies with manufacturing processes. The digitalization of industry, Wei argues, will redefine global production systems, and China, with its advanced manufacturing supply chains and digital leadership, is uniquely positioned to spearhead this transformation.\n\nWei further emphasized that the fourth industrial revolution will not only drive economic growth, but also profoundly impact China's social structure, economic models, and the relationship between humans and nature.\n\nAs I reflect on these developments, it's clear that the shift toward new quality productive forces, driven by AI, IoT and other next-generation technologies, will inevitably position China as a global innovation powerhouse.\n\nThe government's proactive approach to fostering these changes is strategic, forward-thinking and deeply embedded in its broader economic goals for the next few years.\n\nThe story unfolding here isn't just about economic growth \u2014 it's about reshaping the very fabric of industry and society in ways we're only just beginning to comprehend.\n\nAs 2025 approaches, all eyes will be on China to see how it executes this ambitious plan and whether it can truly lead the world into the next industrial revolution."
