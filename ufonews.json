        "article_content": "0 SHARES Share Tweet\n\nUFO 50 Review: Making History\n\nBetween 1982 and 1989, UFO Soft put out a wide variety of classic games for their LX game console. Their titles ranged from shooters and RPGs to sports games and pretty much every genre under the sun. These games, and this console, have been largely forgotten over the years, but this under-heralded team was way ahead of their time and put out a catalog of games that should be considered classics. Now, 50 of those games are back in this fantastic collection called UFO 50. It celebrates what made these games great and really shows off the wide variety of games that were available on the LX.\n\nNone of that is actually true. UFO Soft never existed, and the LX game console wasn\u2019t a thing. What if they were, though? That\u2019s the question asked by some of the best games in the indie gaming space, including Derek Yu and Eirik Suhrke, who are responsible for hits like Spelunky and Downwell. Eight years ago, they got together with a group of indie developers and decided to make a fictional collection of games from a fictional company. The plan was to release it two years later, but making 50 games takes a while, and this title got pushed back again and again. Now, though, UFO 50 is finally here after eight years of development, and thankfully, it was well worth the wait.\n\nYou Can Have Whatever You Like\n\nWhen we think of a development group making 50 games for a collection, I think most of us would tend to assume those would be minigames or at least micro-games. Short and simple titles that wouldn\u2019t take long to make. That\u2019s not the case here, though, at least not largely. The games in UFO 50 are all designed as if they were made for a console released throughout the 80s. As anyone who played games in that period knows, a game that debuted in 1982 is generally very different from a game released in 1989. That means some of the early games in UFO 50 are quite simple, in the same way early black box Nintendo games were. Basic action games, puzzle games that take place on a single screen but with a fun twist, and early side-scrollers, which have a cool hook but don\u2019t look like much. By the end of the collection, though, you have incredibly cool vehicle-based shooters with unique movements, an idle game that encourages regularly returning to it, and a multi-genre action mashup that combines elements of Streets of Rage and Metal Gear with a bunch of owls who look like they belong in a late 80s cartoon.\n\nThe framing and backdrop of UFO 50 is definitely cool, but none of it would be more than a brief curiosity if the games weren\u2019t good. Thankfully though, those eight years of development paid off. In a group of 50 games, not every title can be a true must-play. Still, the hit rate for this many games is really impressive. There are a few games here that don\u2019t do much for me, like Planet Zoldath, which is a bit too slow for my taste, or Onion Delivery, which has controls that definitely feel out of the 80s but which I wouldn\u2019t have liked even then. But even these feel plucked from an era they never existed in and helped set the tone of the collection. The games here are presented in release order by default, though you can sort them many ways easily, and all games are unlocked from the start. If you play in release order as I did at first, you\u2019ll find that some of the early games are a little harder to get into. Barbuta is the first game, and it\u2019s dense, with unintuitive controls and a confusing layout that feels very 1982 but which modern players may bounce off of. Even these early games, though, often have a shocking amount of depth under the hood if you stick with them.\n\nDiving In\n\nLike action games? Mortol is a fascinating title where you have three options to sacrifice your character at any time to clear a path forward for your next life. The goal is to get through each level with as many lives remaining as possible. Kick Club is like a mix of Snow Bros and Bubble Bobble with superb style, which has kept me coming back again and again. The three Campanella titles are all great and show a wonderful evolution of a series. Velgress is basically reverse Downwell, and I mean that as a huge compliment. Rakshasa has a fantastic twist on death which allows you to keep coming back but makes it harder and harder each time you die. Seaside Drive is one of the best driving games I\u2019ve played in a while, with an absolutely killer soundtrack which is true for a lot of these games. Overbold is essentially Smash TV, but with a risk/reward system built in, which got me in trouble far more often than I\u2019d like to admit, but it always kept me coming back for one more run.\n\nIf you want something that\u2019s a bit more puzzle-like, Magic Garden has stolen more of my life in the last week than any other game here. A fascinating mix of Snake and Pac-Man, it\u2019s incredibly charming and addicting. Paint Chase mixes Splatoon with cars and works far better than it has any right to. Attactics forces you to manage your resources to build an army that can protect your castle while taking that of your opponent. Like a lot of these games, it has local multiplayer available, and it\u2019s great for it. Party House is a deck builder that I cannot stop playing, which forces you to manage resources and play a sort of risk versus reward game as you build the ultimate party.\n\nIf you like RPGs, there are plenty of options. Lords of Diskonia is a first-person dungeon crawler that mixes real-time combat with your exploration of the lost depths. Grimstone is a Wild West RPG with timing-based combat and a system of selecting your party, which surprised me from the jump. It\u2019s great, though you will need to be prepared to grind like most RPGs of that time. Vainger is Metroid with the ability to flip your world upside down at any time. Or you have Porgy, an incredibly charming, if difficult, underwater Metroidvania where you\u2019re constantly upgrading your adorable ship to go just a bit further.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nThere are some games here that are harder to group together, too. Rail Heist is an action stealth game where you must sneak onto a train and rob it while getting away with the money. It combines action with puzzle elements in a way I\u2019m not sure any actual 80s games touched, but it\u2019s very cool. Cyber Owls combines four different genres, and while no one of them feels out of time, putting them together pushes it though it is presented as the last game here chronologically. Night Manor is a rather short but impressive point-and-click game right out of the era. There are even a couple of early platform fighters here, with Hyper Contender being a lot of fun.\n\nUFO 50 offers plenty of other games here that I really liked, but I haven\u2019t even mentioned, like Rock On! Island, Mini & Max, Warptank, Waldorf\u2019s Journey, and Bug Hunter. There\u2019s too much here to go into every game with much depth, but many of these games are very good with multiple challenges to complete in each. Each game has not only a base goal of completing them but a higher cherry goal to show you really mastered the game.\n\nBeyond just providing 50 interesting games, UFO 50 also features a code console players can access to put in codes you\u2019ll find hidden throughout the game. These codes can be anything from cheats within certain games to hidden areas, which will unlock more info about UFO Soft. They\u2019re not the main reason to buy UFO 50, but they are a neat little extra for those who fall in love with this collection.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe developers of UFO 50 took on a monumental task in creating 50 unique games for their fictional collection but they accomplished it in wildly successful fashion. Not only are the large majority of these games excellent, but when taken as a fictional canon, they make each other even better. Seeing how they bounce off each other, interact, and tell a story just in the way they evolve is a wonderful experience that\u2019s unlike any other game I\u2019ve played. That said, the main reason to play UFO 50 is because it\u2019s absolutely packed with great games, many of which could have been released on their own and been successful. If you have any affinity for the era of gaming UFO 50 is depicting, you should absolutely check it out.\n\nFinal Verdict: 5/5\n\nAvailable on: PC (reviewed); Publisher: Mossmouth; Developer: Mossmouth; Players: 2; Released: September 18th, 2024; ESRB: N/A; MSRP: $24.99\n\nFull disclosure: This review is based on a retail copy of UFO 50."

Above, another USAF F-22 Raptor during an air show over Toronto, Canada on August 31, 2024\n\nThis official, a director of e-communications for Canadian DND named Taylor Paxton, advised military colleagues that this confusion would be inevitable 'given the current public environment and statements related to the object being benign.'\n\nPaxton suggested that any move by the Royal Canadian Air Force to publish the photo on social media would likely only raise more inquiries from the general public and the press 'regardless of the text that will accompany the post.'\n\nThe emails, obtained along with the eerie new UFO photo by CTVNews.ca reporter Daniel Otis via an open records law request, also included efforts by members of Canada's armed forces to better understand the craft that had been shot down.\n\nOne email from Canadian Brigadier-General Eric Laforest described the UFO as a 'cylindrical object.'\n\n'Top quarter is metallic, remainder white. 20-foot wire hanging below with a package of some sort suspended,' Brig. Gen. Laforest wrote. 'Best description that we have.'\n\nThe suspected spy balloon was one of four airborne objects gunned out of the sky by the US over eight days of February 2023. One unusual feature of the newly released UFO photo is that it had already been designated 'unclassified' within just days of these 19-month-old incidents\n\nA possible reason, as one public affairs official with Canada's Department of National Defence (DND) warned colleagues, was the Canadian military's own internal fears that releasing this UFO image 'may create more questions/confusion'\n\nDark portions visible along the top center of the UFO in this newly released image may depict either that upper metallic region or the remains of the alleged 'package.'\n\nBut this release only adds more mystery to the wave of espionage-tinted UFO activity that surrounded the confirmed downing of an authentic Chinese-government spy balloon earlier that month off the coast of North Carolina's Myrtle Beach.\n\nIain Boyd, a professor of aerospace engineering and director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado, described the Canadian government's reticence to release the image as an issue of national security \u2014 despite the image's 'unclassified' designation.\n\n'It comes down to these episodes illustrating a potential vulnerability in the U.S./Canada defensive system,' Boyd opined.\n\n'Certainly the failure to provide more information has fed conspiracy theories,' as he told CTVNews.ca, 'but the military will likely accept that outcome over disclosing information that may help an adversary identify defensive weaknesses.'\n\nAccording to the report for CTV News, the network's journalists plan to petition the Canadian military for a higher resolution version of this UFO image."

And, of course, that gave me the idea to celebrate \u2013 50th anniversary.\n\n\u201cAnd I have also noticed in the past few years that re-releases, they had no information \u2013 they just had the name UFO and the song titles, but there\u2019s no info, no details. And so I thought I\u2019d take this opportunity to inform people, to re-educate or educate newcomers that have \u2014 maybe they sing the songs, but have no clue what it is.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Deepak Chopra, the world-renowned author and health and wellness expert, has teamed with AI firm ElevenLabs to add his pipes to the company\u2019s roster of notable voices available for audio streaming of books, articles and other written materials.\n\nChopra\u2019s voice pact with ElevenLabs stemmed from the \u201cDigital Deepak\u201d chatbot app that he launched with the company in June. The bot is trained in Chopak\u2019s more than 90 books and numerous public appearances in order to allow people to ask him specific questions and get responses delivered back in Chopra\u2019s synthetic voice.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nLondon-based ElevenLabs has been getting attention in the entertainment industry for its work to partner with the estates of celebrities such as Judy Garland, Laurence Olivier, James Dean and Burt Reynolds to allow users to stream books, articles and other texts as read in the voices of iconic stars. ElevenLabs\u2019 deal with Chopra comes the same day that the industry-leading, Microsoft-backed OpenAI platform rolled out a host of new voices and features to its Advanced Voice Mode service.\n\nChopra\u2019s latest pact with ElevenLabs adds his distinctive voice to the roster that users can choose from when streaming audio spoken-word content. ElevenLabs has made a major effort to underscore that it has worked with estates to reach license agreements offering appropriate compensation. The company also emphasizes that its vault of celebrity voices is only available for audio streaming of written material. ElevenLabs users are not able to use those voices to create new works.\n\n\u201cI am proud to announce my partnership with ElevenLabs. Listening can help cultivate emotional\n\nnurturing and engagement. This is no different in the age of AI, it is only more important,\u201d Chopra said.\n\n\u201cI have always written to connect with people, and now I can connect on a deeper level with a global audience as I make my teachings available for everyone in my own voice.\u201d\n\nElevenLabs\u2019 outreach to the industry is an counteract the pervasive fear in Hollywood, particularly in the creative community, that AI tools will eventually pinch employment for actors, writers, directors, producers and below the line talent.\n\n\u201cAt ElevenLabs, we\u2019re committed to preserving and celebrating cultural legacies while pushing the boundaries of technology,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships for ElevenLabs. \u201cBy bringing voices like Deepak Chopra to our platform, we\u2019re not just enhancing our app \u2013 we\u2019re creating new ways for people to connect with the most influential figures and their work.\u201d\n\nMayim Bialik, actor and neuroscientist who is friendly with Chopra and closely following the growth of AI in content, added her thumbs-up for the ElevenLabs model. Actors in particular are focused in establishing the principle of compensation and consent when AI tools are employed to create new works from older material. AI concerns were at the heart of SAG-AFTRA\u2019s long strike last year and they are the key sticking point in the union\u2019s current strike against top video game publishers.\n\n\u201cDeepak has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to the mind-body connection and the significance of understanding ourselves, so it\u2019s no surprise to see him finding creative ways to leverage the latest and best in AI technology with ElevenLabs in a safe and responsible way,\u201d Bialik said. \u201cBeing able to access his content in his calm and soothing voice is a big win for his fans around\n\nthe world.\u201d\n\nElevenLabs\u2019 latest deal also comes on the heels of AI legislation being signed in to law by California Gov. Gavin Newsom. With SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher at his side, Newsom on Sept. 17 signed two bills, championed by the union, that mandates that AI and tech firms receive the consent of performers if their likeness is to be used in AI-generated new material.\n\nElevenLabs sees the California legislation as a step in the right direction to establishing guardrails around a powerful new high-tech tool that has enormous potential to revolutionize productivity and the way we live and learn, but it also comes with enormous repercussions for copyright violations and misinformation concerns. Blank told Variety he sees such legislation at the state and federal level as essential to nurturing AI business opportunities in the long run.\n\n\u201cWe welcome \u2014 and we believe the whole industry should welcome \u2014 government efforts to hold accountable bad actors who create digital replicas of someone without their consent,\u201d Blank told Variety. \u201cRecognizing that there should be accountability for abuse of technology is an important part of making technology safer while still allowing progress to thrive.\u201d\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

I think we\u2019ve got one,\u201d said Hailong Chen, an associate professor at the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech.\n\n\u201cOur cathode can be a game-changer. It would greatly improve the EV market \u2013 and the whole lithium-ion battery market.\u201d\n\nBatteries are responsible for around 50 per cent of the cost of an electric vehicle, with current technologies making them slightly more expensive than fossil fuel-powered vehicles at today\u2019s prices.\n\nWorldwide EV adoption has been largely driven by government subsidies, however many schemes have already come to an end, making the vehicles less economically viable.\n\nThe new cathode material could make electric cars cheaper than their polluting counterparts, while also offering a solution for larger-scale energy storage needs.\n\n\u201cThis could not only make EVs much cheaper than internal combustion cars, but it provides a new and promising form of large-scale energy storage, enhancing the resilience of the electrical grid,\u201d Professor Chen said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, our cathode would greatly improve the sustainability and supply chain stability of the EV market.\u201d\n\nThe discovery was published in the journal Nature Sustainability this week in a study titled \u2018Low-cost iron trichloride cathode for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries\u2019.\n\nOther recent battery breakthroughs have seen scientists improve the range and charging times of electric cars, both of which are frequently cited as barriers to adoption.\n\nEarlier this month, researchers from the University of Boulder Colorado used an X-ray machine to figure out how to significantly increase the range of electric cars using lithium-ion batteries.\n\n\u201cHaving a better battery is very important in shifting our energy infrastructure away from fossil fuels to more renewable energy sources,\u201d said Michael Toney, a professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. \u201cAll consumers want cars with a large driving range.\u201d"

        "article_content": "The world of technology has always been dynamic and rapidly evolving, but in recent years, a powerful movement has emerged \u2014 one that puts the ability to innovate directly in the hands of individuals without requiring a technical background. This movement is known as \u201cno-code,\u201d and it is transforming how we build software, websites, and even entire businesses.\n\nNo-code tools are a game changer for women in tech, particularly those who may not have formal coding experience. This is where Women of NoCode comes in as a LinkedIn group dedicated to supporting, mentoring, and empowering women in tech through no-code solutions.\n\nThe Inspiration Behind Women of NoCode\n\nWhen creating Women of NoCode, the goal was to build a supportive and empowering community where women could gain confidence in using no-code tools to achieve their goals. The group was born to democratize access to tech innovation and provide an inclusive space where women could learn, collaborate, and elevate each other. The inspiration for the group stemmed from witnessing firsthand how no-code platforms were breaking down barriers that had historically kept women \u2014 and many others \u2014 from entering tech.\n\nTrending Peacock Spider Dances Its Way Into Our Arachnophobic Hearts\n\nThe tech industry is often dominated by people with formal coding skills, which can be intimidating to those without a programming background, but no-code solutions have changed that dynamic. These platforms allow users to build and automate processes without writing a single line of code, meaning someone with an idea can bring it to life, whether creating a mobile app, automating workflows, or developing a new website without extensive technical expertise.\n\nWomen of NoCode was created to connect women with the resources, knowledge, and community to use these tools confidently. By leveraging no-code solutions, women can bring their innovative ideas to life and challenge the notion that tech innovation is reserved for coders.\n\nSupporting Women in Tech Through Resources and Networking\n\nOne of the key pillars of the Women of NoCode group is the support it provides to women in tech through a variety of resources and networking opportunities. From curated content to expert-led discussions, the group offers a wealth of information on how to navigate the no-code landscape. Women who are just starting their tech journey and seasoned professionals alike can all find something of value in the group.\n\nNetworking plays a vital role in advancing one\u2019s career, and Women of NoCode fosters this through a community of like-minded individuals who share a passion for innovation. The group offers a platform where women can collaborate on projects, seek advice, and exchange best practices. Whether through virtual meetups, webinars, or simply engaging with posts on the LinkedIn group, members have countless opportunities to grow their network and gain insights from others in the field.\n\nWhat makes Women of NoCode unique is that it is not just a space to talk about tools and platforms but a space to celebrate women\u2019s achievements in tech. Every success story shared within the group serves as a reminder of what women are capable of when given the right tools and opportunities. These stories help inspire others, fostering a ripple effect of empowerment across the community.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the no-code movement is how it democratizes access to tech. In the past, building a software application or automating business processes required either hiring a developer or learning to code \u2014 both of which are traditionally costly and time-consuming. No-code platforms have changed that, making it possible for anyone, regardless of their background, to become a creator in the tech space.\n\nFor women, this is particularly empowering. Studies show that women are still underrepresented in many technical fields, often due to a lack of access to the necessary training or mentorship. No-code platforms offer a way to bridge this gap by enabling women to acquire tech skills without writing code or requiring programming skills.\n\nThrough Women of NoCode, women are discovering how to leverage no-code tools to solve real-world problems, launch new businesses, and innovate within their existing roles. The accessibility of these tools means that more women can enter the tech industry, contribute to digital transformation, and bring important and unique perspectives to the table.\n\nNo-code solutions also help to level the playing field for entrepreneurs. With the rise of tech startups and the increasing demand for digital transformation, no-code platforms are giving women the ability to build, test, and launch products quickly, opening more doors for women entrepreneurs who may have previously faced challenges securing technical talent or funding. By removing these barriers, no-code empowers more women to become tech leaders and innovators.\n\nJoin The Movement\n\nThe Women of NoCode LinkedIn group is a movement that encourages women to take control of their tech journeys, embrace innovation, and break down barriers that may have held them back. In this group, members are given access to free training, learning how to use no-code tools effectively while building the confidence to lead in an industry that is constantly evolving.\n\nIf you\u2019re a woman in tech, a woman in business, and a woman with a great idea for the next great company \u2014 or even just someone curious about the possibilities of no-code \u2014 joining Women of NoCode will connect you with a thriving community of innovators, problem solvers, and leaders. The future of tech is inclusive, and no-code is helping to make that a reality. Being a part of this group will help you stay at the forefront of tech innovation and contribute to a growing ecosystem of empowered women ready to change the world."

        "article_content": "The third State of Play showcase of 2024 just took place and brought some major announcements with it. Throughout this 30-plus minute show, Sony and its third-party partners showcased over 20 games coming to PlayStation 5 and PSVR2 in the coming months. We got a new look at PS5 games like Lego Horizon Adventures and Monster Hunter Wilds, as well as some exciting new announcements such as Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered , which was leaked by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), and the Ghost of Tsushima sequel Ghost of Y\u014dtei.\n\nWe also got to see some more games that will run on PS5 Pro hardware (its set to release this November). September\u2019s State of Play was a big one PlayStation fans, so there\u2019s a lot to keep track of. To help, we\u2019ve rounded up everything announced during this State of Play.\n\nAstro Bot is getting a major update this fall\n\nAstro Bot - Speedrun and Special Bots Add-On Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nTo kick off the State of Play, we learned that Team Asobi\u2019s critical darling Astro Bot will be getting a significant update. It will add five new online speedrun levels and 10 new bots based on games like Helldivers 2 and Stellar Blade. This new content for Astro Bot will be entirely free and launch sometime this fall on the PS5.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nPalworld is out now on PS5\n\nPalworld - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nPalworld launched on PC and Xbox Series X/S and became a viral success early this year. That happened because the game had the cute creature-collecting elements of Pokemon, but was also extremely violent, like most survival games. In fact, it may be a little too similar to Pokemon, as Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are suing developer Pocketpair. That\u2019s not stopping them from bringing Palworld to more platforms, as it surprise launched on PS5 during tonight\u2019s State of Play.\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds is out next February\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds - Release Date Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds got a new trailer during this State of Play. It showed us some more story cutscenes, a new jungle-like biome, and some threatening new monsters that players will have to fight in the game, like the White Wraith. We also saw Felynes in action in Monster Hunter Wilds for the first time. Most importantly, we finally got a release date for this long-awaited Capcom game. Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on February 28, 2025.\n\nLego Horizon Adventures is out in November\n\nLEGO Horizon Adventures - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nLego Horizon Adventures was revealed in June, but still had no release date. That finally changed today as a new trailer confirmed that Lego Horizon Adventures will be released for PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch on November 14. That lines up with a previously leaked release date for the title. Its new trailer reaffirmed the core concept of the game: it is a kid-friendly, Lego-fied reimagining of the story of Horizon Zero Dawn that isn\u2019t afraid to break canon with costumes based on other PlayStation characters like Sackboy or Ratchet & Clank.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn Remastered is launching sooner than you think\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 & PC Games\n\nEarlier in the month, an ESRB listing revealed the existence of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. Following in the footsteps of similar treatments for the two The Last of Us games, this is a refurbishment of a bestselling PS4 game for Sony\u2019s current platform. The reveal trailer highlights the improved visuals and over 10 hours of rerecorded dialogue. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will be released on October 31, which is much sooner than expected. It will be available across PS5 and PC and will only cost $10 for those who own the original.\n\nGhost of Y\u014dtei is Sucker Punch Productions\u2019 next game\n\nGhost of Y\u014dtei - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nTo close out the show, Sucker Punch Productions surprised us by revealing Ghost of Y\u014dtei, a sequel to 2020\u2019s critically acclaimed Ghost of Tsushima. It follows a new \u201cghost\u201d named Atsu, and takes place around Mount Y\u014dtei in Northern Japan. It also takes place in 1603, which is hundreds of years after Ghost of Tsushima, which is known for its gorgeous vistas and industry-leading visuals. Ghost of Y\u014dtei is shaping up to be very much the same. It will be released exclusively for PS5 sometime in 2025.\n\nEverything else"

        "article_content": "Popular tech YouTuber ChromaLock recently shared a video demonstrating how they managed to connect a \u201cdated\u201d TI-84 graphing calculator to the internet and run ChatGPT, creating, \u201cthe ultimate cheating device.\u201d\n\nIn order to pull off the hack, ChromaLock leveraged custom hardware modifications and an open-source software suite. On the hardware side, the YouTuber installed a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller (specifically, the Seed Studio ESP32-C3), thereby avoiding the need to use the link port to connect to an external connectivity device. They had to tweak the device\u2019s voltage slightly and install a 1K resistor to properly power the microcontroller.\n\nI Made The Ultimate Cheating Device\n\nThe software, on the other hand, is available on Github under the TI-32 repository and acts as \u201ca mod for the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition and TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition calculators to give them internet access and add other features, like test mode breakout and camera support,\u201d according to its description. The modder ran into signal integrity issues during the development process, but was able to mitigate them by building a custom PCB to enable the Wi-Fi microcontroller to impersonate another TI-84 and allow the user to more easily send and share data with their actual TI-84.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIn the video above, ChromaLock shows off some of the device\u2019s capabilities, including a chat function, a monochrome image viewer, and a ChatGPT input window. Essentially, the modification enables users to input complex equations, then have ChatGPT solve them and display the answers on the calculator\u2019s screen.\n\nThe data link appears to be glacially slow and typing long strings of text using a graphing calculator keypad feels like a lot of work, but the device\u2019s capabilities are impressive nonetheless. And ChromaLock is not finished. They plan to add more features in the future, including improvements to the large language model\u2019s functionality, web browsing and email functionality, video playback, and Discord access."
