            "article_content": "The author's father, circa 1981. Courtesy of Lyndall Riedel\n\nThere\u2019s one video available on the internet concerning my father, Patrick McGuire. It\u2019s strange. Uploaded to YouTube 15 years ago \u2014 though clearly recorded much earlier \u2014 the video frames another TV screen. There is constant static, and the image is fractured as if the broadcast comes from far away. My father is discussing cattle mutilations under hypnosis.\n\n\u201cWe come up on a cow that was dead. They cut the nose off, tongues out and the sex organs were gone,\u201d he recounts as though he is sleepwalking through a nightmare. He goes on to describe in great detail a \u201cspaceship\u201d that landed on his ranch and took members of his herd \u2015 their distant, terrified animal cries filling those dark prairie nights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne comment below the video reads, \u201cHaving lived and worked with cow-men, can you immagine this guy going to town after this got out publicly. I mean they are a finicky bunch to say the least.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t have to imagine. I grew up with him walking through our small Western town, his life by then fractured like that broadcast. He was completely destitute, picking through my classmates\u2019 garbage, and when a classmate came to school the next day and told me what they saw, their grin, and subsequent laughter, left little to the imagination. However, I then joined in with their laughter. That commenter was right: We are a finicky bunch, to say the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn May 14, 2009, my father passed away in a Colorado hospital due to cancer. He was 67. I did not speak to him before he died. His last years were spent in homelessness, though he hadn\u2019t always lived that way. His last words, so I heard, were about grand conspiracies and sinister deep states, though he hadn\u2019t always spoken about such topics. My father\u2019s legacy in our small Wyoming town \u2015 and inside our family \u2015 is stained with his tales of alien abduction, interstellar prophecy and the insistence he was chosen, though he had not always been chosen. There was a time before my birth when he was obsessed with the lore of his rural community, the spiraling complexities of high school dances and the schemes of enlarging his Roman Catholic family. He was normal, caring and complete. That was before the stars came knocking.\n\nWhen I first saw the bold headline \u201cIntelligence Officials Say U.S. Has Retrieved Craft of Non-Human Origin,\u201d published June 5, 2023, in The Debrief, I initially didn\u2019t think about whether the headline was true. I didn\u2019t contemplate what the recovered crafts might look like or that \u201cnon-human\u201d was just another euphemism for the same thing we have been talking about since 1947 \u2015 I thought about my father.\n\nI can see him now as though he were alive today, black cowboy hat tilted, face tanned and cracked from the high plains sun, saying, \u201cWho\u2019s laughing now?\u201d I\u2019m not laughing anymore, but not because I know what that headline is saying is absolutely true and proof lies just around the corner; I\u2019m not laughing because I should never have laughed in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ranch that once belonged to Patrick McGuire. The author's father claimed this was where he was visited by aliens. Courtesy of David Riedel\n\nIn 2017, The New York Times broke news about a previously unknown Pentagon department: the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). This department was involved in investigating what were formerly called UFOs, now referred to as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). More shifting euphemisms and acronyms for us to track. Since then, the news surrounding these phenomena has steadily grown. There was a congressional hearing in 2022, the creation of a governmental department called the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and a NASA hearing devoted to encountered \u2015 or not encountered \u2015 UAPs. And now a new whistleblower, former intelligence official and AATIP task force member David Grusch, claims a government cover-up. \u201cThese [programs] are retrieving non-human origin technical vehicles, call it spacecraft if you will, non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed,\u201d he stated to NewsNation recently. What once seemed to be the premise for the next \u201dX-Files\u201d reboot has become front page news, gaining mainstream consideration by the serious, the rational, the institutional and the scientific.\n\nIt\u2019s strange to be here in this cultural moment. I think many people feel that to some degree. Whether this is all true or not, it is unmooring to read that U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is demanding disclosure on a subject that, only a decade ago, would have been political suicide to even mention. To read former Pentagon official Lue Elizondo state, \u201cMy personal belief is that there is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone\u201d is surreal, and stranger still is reading about governmental UFO agencies and \u201cBlack Money\u201d in The New York Times.\n\nD.W. Pasulka, author of the 2019 book \u201dAmerican Cosmic,\u201d an exploration of our cultural interaction with the UFO phenomena, recently referred to this specific whistleblower event and to the preceding media coverage as a \u201cparadigm shift,\u201d a fundamental change in the way we conceptualize an issue. \u201cThat is,\u201d she explained, \u201cthere is huge pressure from [the] fringe, then marginal sources that finally initiate a shift in consensus.\u201d And there is an unexpected change in our current moment from the one that preceded it, though now it feels to me \u2014 perhaps, given my family history, more than most \u2014 like there has also been an unexpected change in the past.\n\nThe stigma against people who believe in UFOs may go back to the very birth of the topic itself, when the first reports of UFOs described by Kenneth Arnold went from \u201csaucer,\u201d \u201cdisk\u201d and \u201cpie pan\u201d to sensational terms like \u201cflying saucers\u201d in the press, for which Arnold later stated, \u201cI have, of course, suffered some embarrassment here and there by misquotes and misinformation.\u201d From there, this subject expanded to include tropes like anal probes, stock characters in films living their lonely, manic lives in houses criss-crossed with spiderwebs of yarn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbductees have been satirized on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and in popular beer commercials. Even famed Harvard psychologist Richard J. McNally stated in his past clinical research into the abduction phenomenon that \u201cit occasionally took [a researcher] several tries to record these [abduction] narratives properly. He would sometimes burst out laughing while trying to record these stories with the necessary solemnity.\u201d Insincerity and mockery has shrouded the subject so thoroughly that NASA recently shared at a hearing that \u201cthe stigma associated with reporting UFO sightings \u2014 as well as the harassment of people who work to investigate them \u2014 may be hindering efforts to determine their origins.\u201d\n\nI know that stigma well \u2015 having experienced it from both sides. My father was born and raised in Wyoming and was a rancher like his father and his grandfather. He nestled into a Western community that branded their cattle and youth alike with abstract symbols, that found definition in the regularity of rain and saw acreage as an inappropriate subject to discuss openly. \u201cAsking about the size of a man\u2019s spread is like asking to look at his checkbook,\u201d he said to me once, laughing. And one local recently told me, \u201cHe could break a horse like nobody\u2019s business. He was real sharp like that. Shame what happened to him.\u201d\n\nMy father saw UFOs. Not one, once, like a dinner guest might claim after a few glasses of wine, but many times. Numerous UFOs all at once, up close, lingering in the western Wyoming sky like a nightmare that refused to dissipate come sunrise. In 1981, on NBC\u2019s prime-time TV show \u201cThat\u2019s Incredible,\u201d my father\u2019s story gained national attention as he related, under hypnosis, the specifics of his abduction claims and the demands aliens had made upon his life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA yearbook photo of the author's father as featured in his funeral pamphlet. Courtesy of David Riedel\n\nOn the March 5, 1980, airing of ABC\u2019s \u201dEyewitness News,\u201d he reported that UFOs had landed on his ranch \u201csomewhere around 25, 30 times,\u201d and witnesses present were quoted as saying they saw \u201ctwo or three of them land at separate times\u2026 [and] we stayed and watched the sun come up and we saw two of them, in daylight, hovering in two separate places.\u201d A headline in the March 24, 1981, National Enquirer reads, \u201cFarmer: Aliens Use My Ranch as Their Landing Place,\u201d and it reports that \u201cLocal newspaper and television reporters have also seen strange lights darting over the McGuire ranch.\u201d\n\nThere appeared to be no shortage of witnesses to what was happening on his land. \u201cWhile we cannot be certain of what we saw,\u201d Casper Star Tribune investigative reporter Greg Bean wrote on June 29, 1980, \u201cnone of us left the McGuire farm with as much skepticism as we arrived with. Perhaps we can return.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father\u2019s claims continued. Under hypnosis with famous UFO psychologist R. Leo Sprinkle, he recounted abductions by \u201cStar People,\u201d who demanded his actions in conjunction with their plan for humanity. These Star People told him of a coming climate apocalypse. Following this hypnosis, in a mere handful of years, he was completely destitute without home or family, and he claimed that governmental forces were keeping him that way because of what he saw and said. This story is a regular in the UFO community. In fact, the story of Grusch, the whistleblower, is no surprise to the community, the folks who did believe and respect my father. Covert conspiracies, recovered craft, Nazi research and \u201cnon-human origins\u201d \u2015 almost everything the whistleblower related, my father related to me in similar fashion at some point in my life.\n\nFrom the earliest points in my childhood, I was told that UFOs were nothing to make light of. At every turn, every nightfall, through any locked door \u2014 the Star People could take anyone, even me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father\u2019s description of the Star People, and my subsequent nightmares, matched what our culture has come to expect: 5-foot hairless beings with eyes like colorless pools hovering by my bedside. Soon classmates and teachers alike were smirking at my fears, and then, like any sociological contagion, I began to smirk, too. Then TV took over for my teachers, and \u201cSouth Park, \u201cConeheads\u201d and \u201cMars Attacks\u201d taught me that this was, indeed, a laughing matter.\n\nMy brothers and I laughed when our father talked about the implants and their accompanying pain. We laughed when he claimed he could barely walk after what the Star People did to him. We laughed when he said that he was suing the government for the land they took from him, for destroying his life, for destroying our lives. We laughed. The world laughed.\n\nIf you were not one to laugh about UFOs, then you didn\u2019t say anything at all, and if you did, you hesitantly considered the person you were talking to first, making sure they would not laugh at you, too, before you said anything at all. For many, it was a precarious high-wire if one was to discuss the trauma of the phenomenon or its reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we weren\u2019t getting our meals in school, my father often took us to the local soup kitchen in a basement bunker in the town Episcopal cathedral. I remember best the dampness of the walls and the claustrophobia of dining elbow-to-elbow with the other folks weathering the financial storms outside. Breaking expired bread to share over lentil soup, we were often the only children in attendance. For most of the diners, this was the last place to go. The person across from me would make small talk between spoonfuls, but nothing of the weather or local gossip. In the soup kitchen, the talk was of remote viewing, reverse-engineering and tapping into the collective unconscious for cosmic spiritual growth. I would nod with feigned excitement and encourage them to continue, go deeper. \u201cWhat about the face of Mars?\u201d I would ask with a smile. My brothers and I often failed to contain our laughter.\n\nThe author's childhood home in Bosler, Wyoming. Courtesy of David Riedel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the world contemplates Grusch\u2019s claims, I\u2019m the one who feels ashamed. These potential findings mean only one thing to me: An accounting must be made. How should we address our past mockery and ridicule if it turns out that, hidden in a desert base somewhere, there are indeed crafts, cadavers and photographs of strange visitors?\n\nRegardless of the origins of the metallic orbs, Tic Tac crafts and flying saucers \u2014 and independent of the validity of Grusch\u2019s claims \u2014 we should feel impelled to investigate and rescue a community living with the trauma of the unknown and indescribable. A community we greeted with sneers and derision for so long, a community we pushed to the outskirts of our cultural limits to be safely ignored. If it is all true \u2015 or it is all lies and sickness \u2015 we should approach both valuations with care and consideration, even skepticism, but not with the intense ridicule so many of us have given them for so long.\n\nI cannot say for certain that a shift in the wider cultural acceptance of UFOs is already occurring in our institutions, as some have begun to state, but I can report what has occurred in my own consciousness. Since the \u201950s, intrepid investigators have spent their whole lives and careers dedicated to the phenomenon of UFOs and abductions, and here we are, possibly closer to the truth than ever. And yet I somehow feel no closer to understanding my father. I was not at his side while he lay on his deathbed, by choice \u2015 a choice I seemingly made as a child and never reassessed. I chose not to hear his last words, and that\u2019s hard for me to accept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough delusions are commonly encountered in schizophrenia and affective disorder, it turns out that anyone can have them,\u201d Mahzarin Banaji and John Kihlstrom stated in their 1996 research titled, \u201cThe Ordinary Nature of Alien Abduction Memories.\u201d \u201cThey are natural byproducts of our attempts to explain the unusual things that can happen to us.\u201d As has been the tradition with this topic, I have little certainty about what happened to my father; I can only say that something unusual happened to him, then he spent the rest of his life trying to make sense of it. And now I will spend the rest of my life trying to make sense of him.\n\nDavid Riedel, born and educated in Bosler, Wyoming, is a University of Wyoming graduate student whose writing often examines the realities of addiction and mental illness inside this strange, frightening world we all inhabit.

The special significance of the 1967 wave is that it occurred during the one full year of investigations by the University of Colorado UFO Project.\n\nA Revival of the 61-Month Wave Theory Donald A. Johnson, Ph.D. The Knowles family CE-II encounter with an ovoid-shaped UFO on the Nullarbor Plateau in Western Australia January 20th was right on target in terms of time and place, according to the 61-month wave cycle first proposed by Dr. David Saunders back in 1971. At least two other UFO encounters of major importance occurred that same night in Australia and Tasmania. If the indications are correct and this is not an isolated incident but the beginnings of a major UFO wave, we will have to reconsider the significance of this long-term prediction... R\n\nAnalyzing UFO Waves - Surge of Sightings Imminent? Joseph W. Ritrovato, MUFON UFO Journal, March, 1995 During my investigation into the UFO phenomena all promising sightings were collected from ancient times to the present to see if any noticeable patterns would arise. Nobody (to my knowledge) has been able to claim success in predicting UFO waves consistently, but this could be explained by many periodic factors interacting rather than just one or two waveforms.

There is, however, at the moment, no method or any attempt by any researcher to accurately quantify a UFO wave. R\n\nSignals, Noise, and UFO Waves Richard Hall, The International UFO Reporter, Winter, 1999 Over the past 50 years a seeming outbreak of UFO sightings has captured public and news media attention on average about every five to eight years. Sometimes the sightings have been sufficiently spectacular that the publicity has led someone to attempt a scientific study, but these studies usually bog down in confusion and controversy, and the interest fades away.\n\nThe Great UFO Wave: October, 1973 - What Happened? Kenny Young, UFO Research, Cincinnati Perhaps one day through future revelation or discovery, history may acknowledge the bizarre blitz of UFO sightings across America which happened in the shadows of Watergate. But for today, most people are unaware of the extraordinary UFO Wave of 1973. R\n\nThe Importance of UFO Waves Joseph W. Ritrovato, MUFON UFO Journal of June, 1996 In his book UFOs and Outer Space Mysteries, UFO skeptic James E. Oberg proposes a hypothetical test case to demonstrate that there is probably nothing of significance to the UFO phenomena. If one was to search his book for any reference to UFO waves one would come up empty handed. He ignores the subject entirely. The reason, I suspect, is he knows that therein lies possible proof that UFOs are a serious phenomena and distinctly different from simple misidentifications or overly active imaginations.

One list is sorted by State and the second sorted by rate of unexplained reports per 10,000 population in 1990.\n\nUFO Flaps - A Context for Scientific Study Bill Chalker One of the more frustrating aspects of the UFO phenomenon is its unpredictability. One of the mainstays of the scientific method is the repeatable experiment. In the case of an unpredictable and elusive phenomenon this is rather hard to organise. Occassionally UFO phenomena occurs in specific localities for an extended period. These are refered to as localised \"flaps\". R\n\nUFO Patterns & Predictions Researchers have tried to establish one aspect of the UFO phenomenon; not at the locations where sightings have taken place, but as regards the time of the periodicity of UFOs. The reports of sightings are based on the time factor with possible correlation of their periodicity, to type of physical interpretation that shows a similar periodicity.

For some time from that point on, literally thousands of people reported seeing triangular aircraft in the Belgian skies, exhibiting flight characteristics which simply cannot be explained, with regard to mundane terrestrial aircraft. Unlike previous flaps, these accounts generated report after report of what, in essence, was exactly the same type of craft.\n\nThe Great UFO Wave: October,1973 UFO Research Cincinatti This site is dedicated to presenting details of a most inflammatory UFO happening: a nationwide rash of UFO sightings climaxing in October of 1973.

Yesterday, the company unveiled upcoming Galaxy AI enhancements for its Sketch-to-Image tool. It also released a short teaser showcasing a seamless, conversational Galaxy AI experience set to debut on the next-generation flagships.\n\nThe video shows a woman interacting seamlessly with Galaxy AI, asking it to find a pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating, sharing the details with a friend, and adding the information to her calendar \u2014 all in one flow. This suggests that the upcoming Galaxy S25 series will enable Galaxy AI to work across multiple apps on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nThis functionality is likely tied to the next-generation Bixby, which Samsung launched with advanced AI capabilities in China last year. With the Galaxy S25 series, the upgraded Bixby is expected to roll out globally as part of the One UI 7 experience, potentially also making it accessible on older Galaxy flagships.\n\nAs highlighted in Samsung\u2019s latest teaser, the revamped Bixby aims to deliver a more natural and intuitive user experience. It is designed to retrieve information from apps like Calendar or Samsung Internet, understand on-screen context, and seamlessly integrate with apps for tasks such as getting directions or managing schedules.\n\nReserve the next Galaxy for $50 Samsung Credit and more savings!

            "article_content": "As a fifth grader, Josiah Golojuh faced a dilemma.\n\nHis teacher had assigned the class to write a descriptive essay about a family vacation, but Josiah hadn\u2019t been on a vacation he thought was interesting. So, Josiah wrote about a fictional vacation that included far-fetched interactions with the supernatural.\n\nJosiah\u2019s classmates voted his essay one of the best, and Josiah was hooked on writing fiction.\n\nJosiah Golojuh, 42, now lives in Huntington Beach, California, but his first novel, \u201cThe Paper Boy\u201d (Stage Beetle Books / 2024), is paranormal fiction inspired by the author\u2019s experiences growing up in Russellton \u2014 a small Allegheny County town about 20 miles northeast of Downtown Pittsburgh \u2014 and delivering newspapers in a trailer park in West Deer.\n\nInteracting with people on the paper route and listening to customers at his family\u2019s hair salon connected Josiah to his community. \u201cThat was how I began to learn character,\u201d he said.\n\nPenny Golojuh, 7, waits as her father, Josiah Golojuh, signs his book, \u201cThe Paper Boy,\u201d on Dec. 31, 2024. Penny and her sister, Primrose Golojuh, 5, designed the cover for one of their father\u2019s comic books. Photo by John Beale.\n\nIn addition to the inspiration gained from customers he met, the money earned delivering papers helped to fuel his passion for reading and collecting comic books. Decades later, Josiah started a comic book company and published three of his own comic books, sometimes featuring character namesakes of people from his childhood.\n\nJosiah moved to California in 2002 to attend the University of Southern California. He teaches writing at Coastline Community College, but he\u2019s quick to credit growing up in Russellton, population 1,200, with feeding his imagination for fiction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d walk over to Palmer\u2019s drugstore with my older brother to buy Slush Puppies. To a very small kid, that walk was like navigating the streets of a large city. The buildings felt gigantic,\u201d Josiah recalled.\n\nShelly Irvine of Curtisville talks with Josiah Golojuh, left, about his book. Josiah\u2019s daughter, Primrose Golojuh, 5, is seated next to her father. Photo by John Beale.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, Josiah returned to Russellton\u2019s Palmer Pharmacy to promote his book. By mid-morning, a dozen people formed a line that extended to the pharmacy counter next to a wall displaying orthopedic shoes. At the far end of the counter, a young man wearing a ball cap waited for a prescription near a display for live bait.\n\nSharpie in hand, the author and his two young daughters sat at a table facing a rack stacked with the latest edition of the newspaper Josiah delivered 30 years ago. Behind him, several customers sat on green-padded stools as they drank coffee at a soda fountain counter repurposed as a coffee bar. Josiah Golojuh, left, waits to sign his book, \u201cThe Paper Boy,\u201d as Josiah\u2019s father, George Golojuh, greets a visitor to the book signing event. Behind Josiah is his wife, Judy Golojuh. Photo by John Beale.\n\nThe Russellton pharmacy has been a hub in the community for decades, and the book signing resembled a homecoming of sorts. Josiah later said the gathering was \u201cmagical.\u201d His hometown no longer seemed so large.\n\nJosiah\u2019s wife and parents were there. Shirley Irvine came from Curtisville. Shirley\u2019s daughter, Erin Irvine Nemazee, from Northern Virginia was there with her two daughters. Erin was in a school play with Josiah. Gary Lutz of Gibsonia, one of Josiah\u2019s high school friends and a namesake for a character in one of Josiah\u2019s comic books, came to get a photo. Chris Cushman was there to buy a book. He and Josiah shared a seat on the school bus.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of you,\u201d a woman with short graying hair said with a smile as Josiah wrote an inscription inside her book.\n\nLater in the week, Josiah said he was welcomed during a visit to Deer Lakes Middle School to talk with students about his book and his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed with gratitude and humbled by my community,\u201d Josiah said. \u201cI may live somewhere else, but this will always be my home.\u201d"

Learn More \u203a\n\nA man unlocking his front door with a smart keypad.\n\nWe love any opportunity to see the debuts of fun, new, even futuristic gadgets\u2014who doesn\u2019t? But the home security technology unveiled at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) had our attention because of what it means for homeowners\u2019 safety, convenience, and savings.\n\nBased on what CES presented, we saw several home security trends emerge for protecting property, family, and packages. With corresponding technology offering everything from better sensors to sleeker designs, these are our predictions for home safety and security in 2025.\n\nPhoto: Lockly\n\n1. Sleeker, Design-Forward Security\n\nThough door knobs with smart locks have added numerical or touchscreen keypads, they still look relatively similar to traditional handles. As technology advances, however, we see companies focusing on more sleek, modern designs that not only incorporate additional features but also reimagine the standard design of smart handles.\n\nLockly Styla\n\nLoved by DIYers and professional builders alike, Lockly is leading the way in creating new looks and enhanced functionality with the Styla. This combination front door handle, smart deadbolt, and video doorbell fits into a cylindrical modern door pull most easily imaginable for high-end residential applications. And it fits a lot in a skinny profile. The video component has a motion sensor, a 2K camera with color night vision, and two-way audio. The smart lock works via a 3D fingerprint sensor, a PIN Genie pad with a randomizable keypad, an RFID reader with programmable fobs, and a traditional keyhole.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough its aesthetics push the envelope enough that they may take some getting used to, we think this and other innovative designs will continue to become more common. This all-in-one handle, lock, and video doorbell comes in matte black, gray, and gold and is battery-powered for easy installation and rechargeable via USB. The Styla also comes with Lockly\u2019s new Wi-Fi hub that privately stores recorded videos and audibly chimes rather than pinging your phone. Stay tuned for when the Lockly Styla becomes available later this year.\n\nPhoto: Schlage\n\n2. Better Sensors\n\nWhile most of us have seen smart locks with numeric buttons or touchscreen keypads, some recently released products indicate better and much harder-to-fool technology is on the way. Though we\u2019re only highlighting two popular CES products here, we predict many brands will be increasing their focus on lock sensors for home security soon.\n\nTCL Smart Lock D1 Pro\n\nThe TCL Smart Lock D1 Pro requires something much more unique than a four-digit code to unlock it: your palm. Though the D1 Pro was launched this past October, CES attendees couldn\u2019t help but flock to see its revolutionary operation. Among its seven unlocking methods, the most interesting by far is its use of AI technology to read and recognize the layout of veins in your palm. Like many other smart locks, it also works via keypad, app, cards, period passwords, standard keys, and voice assist via Google Home and Amazon Alexa. The lock features a 7,800mAh rechargeable battery and durable IP54 weather-resistant construction.\n\nGet the TCL D1 smart lock at Amazon for $179.99.\n\nSchlage Sense Pro\n\nAnother reputable leader in the home security market, Schlage introduced its new Sense Pro Smart Deadbolt at this year\u2019s CES. In addition to a standard touchscreen keypad for code entry, the smart deadbolt uses Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology paired with select personal devices of your choosing to enable hands-free and tap-to-unlock access. Connected to your smart home network, the lock can automatically calculate your speed and trajectory as you approach and unlatch on its own. The Sense Pro is expected to come out later this year.\n\nPhoto: Switchbot\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Increased Front Door Visibility\n\nWith video doorbells showing up next to more front doors every day, it\u2019s relatively standard to be able to check your phone when you hear a chime alerting you to a visitor. Still, it\u2019s not always the most convenient if you\u2019re on a call to see if there\u2019s cause for attention or alarm. Some households may include members without smartphones who can\u2019t access an app-only display. Two products that showed up at CES remedied this issue by integrating their own displays, hardwiring optional.\n\nSwitchBot Video Doorbell\n\nThe SwitchBot Video Doorbell combines a traditional-looking video doorbell with a 4.3-inch smart display screen you can sit on a surface or mount to the wall. The screen delivers live videos, notifies you if anyone arrives, lets you talk to visitors while keeping your door closed, and features 512GB of local storage.\n\nThe unit can be either wired or battery-powered, and SwitchBot will also offer a solar panel to ensure continuous operation. The 2K resolution camera has a 165-degree field of view and color night vision to help you identify visitors no matter the time of day. At the time of publication, no specifics on the SwitchBot Video Doorbell launch date have been announced yet.\n\nLockly Vision Prestige\n\nIn a similar push to enable front door visibility without relying on phones, Lockly will release its Vision Prestige smart lock later this year. Rather than casting video to a separate screen like the SwitchBot Video Doorbell, this lock has a display on its interior housing. It uses presence detection powered by bit radar and a 2K resolution camera with facial recognition to clock when a person is at the door, and the screen lights up when you touch it so you can identify that individual from the inside. It even boasts an intercom, like most video doorbell cameras, so that you can have a conversation through your front door.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Vision Prestige offers a few different means of securing the home, too: keyed entry, fingerprint recognition, and a patented pin entry. You can switch from a traditional touchscreen keypad to Lockly\u2019s PIN Genie, which places digits in random locations, guaranteeing safe entry into your home without revealing your code to prying eyes. We expect the Prestige\u2014an upgrade to the current Lockly Vision\u2014to drop near the end of the year.\n\nPhoto: Hyve\n\n4. Smarter Ways To Secure Deliveries\n\nWhile package delivery boxes and locking mailboxes aren\u2019t a totally new concept, more options have hit the market with smart features like remote locking and unlocking via app and automated video recording. And since package theft is a problem almost everyone has experienced, seen, or heard about, we predict package lockboxes with additional security features will continue to roll out.\n\nHyve Smart Home Delivery Pod\n\nThe Hyve smart home delivery pod may look somewhat similar to a standard front porch delivery box. Like other smart delivery boxes, users can lock and unlock the Hyve pod via an app and send unique codes to drivers, family members, and friends. But that\u2019s far from all this model offers. The box sounds a siren and sends a tamper alert to your phone if it detects anyone is attempting to access it without authorization. It also features a carbon-fiber tether to secure the entire unit to a column or railing, preventing would-be thieves from stealing the entire box. There\u2019s a window on top to allow drivers to take delivery confirmation photos, and Hyve is even compatible with package pickup software to help make arranging returns easier. You can join the waitlist for the smart package pod, expected to start shipping in June."

            "article_content": "Different office dress codes can lead to many question marks on what to wear, especially if your workplace is casual.\n\nHowever, even if your work environment is laid-back, consideration to your everyday look is important. A relaxed office setting can offer a wide variety of what you can stock your wardrobe with, allowing for some true creativity. The best casual work outfits blend the lines between professional, polished, and fashion-forward.\n\nHere, we took inspiration from the street style set to find perfect casual work looks that don\u2019t feel too stuffy or corporate. Many of these outfits incorporate elements of traditional workwear, such as blazers, trouser pants, and button-downs, but each is styled in a modern, effortless way for today\u2019s working woman. You\u2019ll also find unexpected items, such as leather shackets and bold-colored shirting, mixed with classic work pants or denim. When the look is combined with strong accessories, such as structured handbags, comfortable, kitten heels, and yes\u2014even work sneakers\u2014 the results are on point.\n\nKeep reading to discover the 9 best casual work outfit ideas to keep your office wardrobe feeling fresh and in the moment. Each look combines the simplicity and practicality you\u2019re looking for, with stylish results.\n\n\n\n1. Poplin That Pops\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nIf your dress code is casual, it\u2019s the perfect excuse to experiment with color in your work wardrobe. A poplin shirt in pastel pink still reads office-appropriate, yet offers a fun twist that doesn\u2019t feel too restrictive. When paired with dark denim trousers, the look is unstoppable. We recommend accessorizing with a chunky belt and reliable Chelsea boots to keep things fresh and modern, while remaining extremely comfortable.\n\n2. Smart Separates\n\nClaudio Lavenia // Getty Images\n\nYou can still mix and match core office pieces into your wardrobe, such as button-downs and trouser pants, but keep the styling from feeling too buttoned up. Forget the matching suit jacket in this case, and pair these everyday essentials with modern accessories, such as a roomy, leather tote bag in a cool cream tone and a low-heeled leather boot, for a polished, yet relaxed approach to your office look.\n\n3. Cropped Capris\n\nChristian Vierig // Getty Images\n\nWhen it\u2019s warm outside, you can try the trend-forward, capri pant styled with a timeless blazer and button-down. It will give the look an extra nonchalant feel. Keep accessories classic, just like the rest of the outfit, with a sleek slingback and coordinating handbag. It\u2019s a fresh way to do tailoring for the modern day.\n\n4. Boardroom Basics\u2014Remixed\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s true, a blazer and silk button-down shirt have the makings of a corporate closet, but that is why we are encouraging a little remix. By wearing these work wardrobe must-haves with cool, straight jeans and \u201cDad\u201d sneakers, these foundations are made to feel a little more relaxed. You will still look professional, just with a little, street style flair.\n\n5. Luxe Leather\n\nChristian Vierig // Getty Images\n\nA casual workplace offers the opportunity to experiment with texture. A leather shacket (or faux version) is a great way to reinvent the traditional, work shirt. It will become the focal point to build your whole outfit around. Style it with wide-leg trousers, pointy shoes (flats are a must), and an east-west handbag all in a bright white hue.\n\n6. Retro Feels\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nA quirky shirt with a retro nod can lend a bit of fun to your office attire. Whether you go for a color-blocked, western-style version or an oversized bowler, keep things grounded by pairing it with neutral mainstays such as a leather midi skirt, pointed flat, and structured handbag, all in black. The look is cute, casual, yet still completely appropriate for an office setting that is on the laid-back side.\n\n7. Silky Suiting\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nIf you want to go the suiting route, make it a silk one. It\u2019s a little less formal than more structured fabrics, such as wool or cotton, and extra comfortable to wear all day long. This set feels just like your favorite pajama set. Layer a white T-shirt underneath to keep things from feeling too proper, and pair it with leather Mary Jane flat shoes (or white sneakers!).\n\n8. To the Maxi\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nWearing a one-and-done maxi dress is the easiest way to get you out the door in style. A sweater dress is the best solution for when you want to stay comfortable and warm. Keeping with the casual theme, minimalist accessories should be your go-to. We love the simplicity of a kitten heel shoe, gold chain necklace, and mini designer bag.\n\n9. Espresso Dreams\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nA cardigan can be your best friend in the colder months, but how do you keep it from looking too casual? The answer is simple: pair it with an elegant maxi skirt. In the winter, we love a wool fabrication; when it\u2019s warmer, a denim version. Style it with kitten heels and a shoulder bag, all in similar espresso tones."

            "article_content": "Key Biscayne's Police Department will be providing safety tips each month following local and national trends to help avoid residents from falling victims to scams and crime.\n\nThis month's tip is a recent trend involving the use of QR codes, typically used to facilitate quick access to a website or app.\n\nIn the world of cybercrime, the act of fraudulent QR code used to steal an individual's credentials, passwords or even bank accounts is labeled as \"quishing,\" a different form of phishing by using a malicious QR code.\n\nOn recent social media posts, there have been incidents in which a fake QR code has been pasted over the legitimate QR code in cases of parking lots, for example.\n\n\"They can gain access to the data of what's on your phone,\" said Lt. Kristina Andreu with the Key Biscayne Police Department. \"We don't charge for parking here, but you may see QR codes on restaurants or other places. The best way to view the menu, if that's what it's for, is just go online to the restaurant's website and see it or go into the restaurant itself if you think there might be a problem.\"\n\nNBC 6 South Florida recently posted a short YouTube video on how fraudulent stickers can lead to a victim's financial woes.\n\nThe overlapping fake stickers on QR codes are just one way scammers are trying to gain access. Complete replacement of a legitimate sticker is another (the real one is behind it), and scammers might be even creating their own illegitimate menu off the existing QR code.\n\nHow the QR code works:\n\nWhen someone uses their cell phone camera to scan a QR code, the phone automatically opens the corresponding app or website. However, if you know the website you\u2019re trying to reach, scanning a QR code is not necessary; it simply eliminates that step.\n\nUnfortunately, hackers have discovered a way to exploit unsuspecting victims who innocently scan QR codes, allowing them to access all the data on their mobile devices.\n\nPolice advise the public not to scan any suspicious QR codes, avoid scanning QR codes that come in packages or mail from unfamiliar companies and to avoid scams in parking lots by logging into the website and make the payment manually\n\nAndreu's advice is simple: \"If it looks suspicious, don't do it!\""

            "article_content": "A new category of particles, termed \"paraparticles,\" has been theorized by physicists, offering a fresh perspective on the fundamental building blocks of nature. These particles defy traditional classifications of fermions and bosons, presenting unique properties that could revolutionize understanding in quantum mechanics and potentially enhance quantum computing capabilities. The mathematical model defining paraparticles opens up possibilities for experimental realization using advanced quantum computing systems, as suggested by experts in the field. This discovery hints at the existence of undiscovered particles in the natural world.\n\nProposed Characteristics and Implications\n\nAccording to a study published in Nature, led by Zhiyuan Wang of the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics and Kaden Hazzard of Rice University, paraparticles exhibit behaviors distinct from those of fermions and bosons. The researchers developed a theoretical framework that allows these particles to exist in any dimensional setting, broadening the scope for their potential applications. Unlike fermions, which adhere to the Pauli exclusion principle, or bosons, which prefer shared states, paraparticles possess their own unique exclusion rules.\n\nWang revealed to Nature that this concept emerged unexpectedly during his Ph.D. research in 2021. The challenge of recreating paraparticles in controlled conditions remains, but quantum computing advancements may make it possible. Experts believe their properties could contribute to reduced error rates in quantum computational systems.\n\nComparison with Anyons\n\nReports from Nature have highlighted the distinction between paraparticles and another exotic particle type, anyons, which were recently demonstrated in a one-dimensional setting by a team led by Joyce Kwan and Markus Greiner at Harvard University. The rubidium-87 atoms used in their experiment displayed twisted wavefunctions, a hallmark of anyonic behavior. Unlike paraparticles, anyons' wavefunctions retain a memory of their positional swaps, making them highly relevant for quantum information storage.\n\nAlthough paraparticles may not possess the same robustness as anyons, their ability to exist in three-dimensional spaces makes them a compelling area for further exploration. These advancements signal exciting opportunities in the realm of quantum physics and computing technologies."

Learn More.\n\nOpenAI is doubling down on its vision for AI in the U.S., unveiling its economic blueprint, \u201cAI in America.\u201d This document outlines strategies to spur AI development, regulate the technology, and maintain America\u2019s edge over global competitors like China. The release comes as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman strengthens ties with the incoming Trump administration, signaling a pivotal moment for AI policy.\n\n\u201cWe believe America needs to act now to maximize AI\u2019s possibilities while minimizing its harms,\u201d OpenAI head of global policy Chris Lehane writes in the blueprint, which highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize sectors like medicine, education, and finance while emphasizing the need for responsible development.\n\nKey Proposals in OpenAI\u2019s Economic Blueprint\n\nThe 15-page OpenAI blueprint offers the following recommendations for advancing AI in America:\n\nIncreased Investment in Infrastructure: The company urges significant public and private funding for advanced computing centers essential for AI tools and systems.\n\nThe company urges significant public and private funding for advanced computing centers essential for AI tools and systems. International Collaboration: OpenAI advocates for partnerships with countries in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, to attract investment and prevent funds from flowing to China.\n\nOpenAI advocates for partnerships with countries in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, to attract investment and prevent funds from flowing to China. Light-Touch AI Regulations: OpenAI recommends a unified federal framework for AI regulations, opposing state-level rules that could fragment the industry and weaken U.S. competitiveness.\n\nOpenAI recommends a unified federal framework for AI regulations, opposing state-level rules that could fragment the industry and weaken U.S. competitiveness. Balancing Growth With Safety: The company highlights the importance of security measures while ensuring the equitable distribution of AI benefits.\n\nThe timing of this initiative is no coincidence. In December, Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s CEO, donated $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural fund. This move signals a calculated effort to strengthen ties with the incoming administration and influence its AI strategy.\n\nThe Stakes for AI Development in America\n\nThe competition to lead in AI is fierce. OpenAI\u2019s rivals, including xAI\u2014led by Elon Musk, an ally of incoming president Trump\u2014are scaling up investments in computing infrastructure. With the stakes so high, OpenAI\u2019s blueprint warns that delays in U.S. policy could redirect critical foreign investments to China.\n\nLehane framed the geopolitical challenge succinctly: \u201cAre those countries going to be building on U.S. rails or on CCP rails?\u201d The implications extend beyond economics, touching on national security and global AI dominance.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe economic blueprint represents OpenAI\u2019s effort to shape the Trump administration\u2019s approach to AI. With a focus on collaboration and innovation, OpenAI plans to host an event on January 30 to demonstrate its latest technology and engage with policymakers. This push underscores the critical role AI plays in America\u2019s economic and strategic future. While the debate over AI regulations continues, OpenAI\u2019s proposals aim to secure the U.S.\u2019s leadership in this transformative field, ensuring both growth and safety.\n\nLearn how to invest in AI to stay ahead of the curve and make the most out of AI opportunities offered by the likes of OpenAI\u2019s blueprint."

That\u2019s how synonymous the search engine of the US tech giant has become with looking something up online, and this is reflected in Google\u2019s market share. Over 90% of online searches in the last decade were conducted on Google Search, but a surprising trend change suggests that the balance of power might just be starting to shift.\n\nAs reported by Search Engine Land, statistics from Statcounter show that Google\u2019s global search market share dropped below 90% for each of the last three months. Specifically, it was 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.73% in December.\n\nOver 89% is still a commanding grip on the market, but what\u2019s most interesting about this development is that it\u2019s the first time Google has failed to hold a 90% market share in a three-month period since the first quarter of 2015 \u2014 almost exactly 10 years earlier.\n\nWhile you might assume that ChatGPT snaffled up some of Google\u2019s custom, the statistics indicate that the traditional search engine competitors benefited most from this trend change. The information is limited, but it appears that Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo! all got a slight boost. Bing was second in terms of market share in December, albeit with just under 4% of online searches.\n\nA potential shift in customer focus wouldn\u2019t be great news for Google, although there could be a silver lining. The firm remains embroiled in a long-running and high-profile antitrust case, with the Department of Justice accusing Google of monopolistic behavior. Part of Google\u2019s defense has been to point out that users have a choice and are free to exercise it. These statistics could add alittle extra weight to that argument.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

Discover SCENE\n\nThe NFT market suffered a dismal 2024, with trading volumes and sales counts dropping to their weakest levels since 2020.\n\nAnnual trading volumes fell by 19%, while sales counts dipped by 18% compared to 2023, according to a report by blockchain analytics platform.\n\nDespite a surge in crypto market activity, driven by Bitcoin\u2019s all-time highs and booming DeFi growth, NFTs appeared to struggle under the weight of their own inflated valuations.\n\nEarly in the year, NFT trading volumes reached $5.3 billion in Q1, a modest 4% increase compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nHowever, this momentum proved fleeting, as volumes plummeted to $1.5 billion in Q3 before recovering slightly to $2.6 billion in Q4.\n\nEven with these fluctuations, annual sales counts fell sharply, pointing to a broader trend: while individual NFTs became more expensive in line with rising crypto token prices, overall market engagement dwindled.\n\nYuga Labs\u2019 flagship collections Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) hit historic lows, with floor prices dropping to 15 ETH and 2.4 ETH, respectively.\n\nEven Otherdeeds for Yuga Labs' Otherside metaverse plummeted to 0.23 ETH, a far cry from their initial minting price, exposing cracks in Yuga\u2019s high-priced, membership-driven model.\n\nThis coincided with DappRadar\u2019s observation that \u201cPerhaps 2024 helped us realize that NFTs don\u2019t need to be expensive to prove their importance in the broader Web3 ecosystem,\u201d a critique of the market\u2019s reliance on exclusivity and inflated pricing.\n\nAmid this downturn, the NFT market witnessed a paradox in November when CryptoPunk #8348, a rare seven-trait collectible from the NFT collection, was collateralized for a $2.75 million loan via the NFT lending platform GONDI.\n\nTouted as a milestone for NFTs as financial assets, this event showed speculative excess when juxtaposed with DappRadar\u2019s insights about affordability and utility.\n\nWhile high-profile transactions like this aim to affirm NFTs\u2019 value, they also highlight a market still driven by exclusivity and inflated pricing, even as wider participation wanes.\n\nEven within the struggling sector, blue-chip collections like CryptoPunks defied trends, nearly doubling in USD value in 2024 with notable sales driving brief recovery periods.\n\nNFT platforms like Blur dominated marketplace activity, leveraging zero-fee trading and aggressive airdrop campaigns to capture the largest share of trading volumes.\n\nIn contrast, rival marketplace OpenSea struggled with regulatory headwinds and declining market sentiment, forcing significant layoffs by year-end.\n\nBy Q4, Blur and OpenSea were neck-and-neck in market share, but Blur\u2019s ability to generate high activity from a smaller, more active user base gave it the edge, as per the report.\n\nWhile trading volumes in late 2024 hinted at a potential recovery\u2014November sales hit $562 million, the highest since May\u2014the overall trajectory suggests that affordability, accessibility, and utility will be critical for sustained growth in 2025."

The cinema capital\u2019s wealth and industrial diversity, along with other natural advantages from geography and weather, may allow Los Angeles to stave off a worst-case scenario.\n\nEstimating the likely economic losses is tricky at this stage. The weather data company AccuWeather has offered a figure of $250 billion to $275 billion, though a Goldman Sachs report said it found the estimate high. (Declining to provide a breakdown because its methodology is \u201cproprietary,\u201d AccuWeather said it considered many factors including long-run health impacts as well as short-term losses in the value of public companies exposed to the disaster.)\n\nHere are some elements to account for when thinking about the total cost of the fires.\n\nPhysical Wreckage\n\nThe most straightforward component of damage is the number of structures damaged or destroyed, currently about 12,000. That\u2019s fewer than the 18,000 felled by the Camp fire in Northern California in 2018, but this is a different kind of house: Zillow values the average home in the Pacific Palisades ZIP code at $3.4 million; in Altadena\u2019s ZIP code, it\u2019s $1.3 million.\n\nThat\u2019s what is driving early estimates of insured losses progressively higher, now reaching $30 billion, according to Wells Fargo. But insurance will neither make all homeowners whole nor pay the full cost of rebuilding. Carriers have dropped thousands of policies in the affected areas in recent years, and the state-backed insurer of last resort caps coverage at $3 million per residential property.\n\nThen there\u2019s the damage to commercial space.

            "article_content": "This study explores how the integration of DevOps methodologies has transformed the management of cloud infrastructure, with a focus on the critical role of automation in achieving scalability. Originating as a response to the inefficiencies and challenges faced in traditional software development and IT operations, DevOps emphasizes a culture of collaboration and automation to enhance the speed and quality of software delivery. This transformation has been pivotal in addressing the \u201cfatal level of dysfunction\u201d perceived between development and operations, ultimately streamlining workflows and enabling faster, more reliable deployments.[1][2]\n\nAt its core, DevOps integrates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) by implementing practices such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), and automated monitoring. These practices facilitate a seamless and repeatable process for software development and deployment, reducing human error and ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages.[3][4][5] Automation tools, including AWS, Azure, GitLab, and Jenkins, play an essential role in managing infrastructure resources, enabling businesses to scale operations efficiently and respond quickly to market demands.[6][3]\n\nThe adoption of DevOps within cloud environments has introduced significant enhancements in scalability, largely through practices like containerization and microservices architecture. These technologies allow for greater application portability and resource optimization, thus supporting the efficient scaling of individual services and contributing to overall system reliability.[3][7] As DevOps continues to evolve, organizations are increasingly leveraging its principles to maintain a competitive advantage in dynamic markets, overcoming traditional infrastructure limitations and fostering innovation.[1][8]\n\nDespite its benefits, the implementation of DevOps is not without challenges, including the need for careful oversight and cultural shifts within organizations. The transition to a DevOps model requires buy-in across all levels to ensure successful collaboration and accountability, thereby maximizing the impact of automation and scalability practices in cloud infrastructure management.[4][9] As the industry continues to advance, DevOps is expected to play an even more integral role in shaping the future of cloud infrastructure, driving further adoption of cutting-edge practices and technologies.[1][6]\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThe evolution of DevOps in cloud infrastructure can be traced back to a growing recognition of dysfunction in the software development and IT operations industries in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During this period, proposals began to emerge advocating for the integration of software development methodologies with deployment and operations concepts[1]. However, it was not until around 2007 and 2008 that the DevOps movement started to gain significant traction. This surge was driven by mounting concerns within the IT and software development communities regarding the detrimental separation between development and operations, which was perceived to create a \u201cfatal level of dysfunction\u201d in the industry[2][1].\n\nDevOps was conceived as a methodological response to these challenges, emphasizing collaboration, culture change, and the adoption of specific practices and tools[1]. The movement sought to address the inefficiencies and slow delivery times of traditional software development and IT operations practices by integrating and automating their processes[1]. This integration aimed to improve the speed and quality of software delivery, thereby enhancing the overall systems development life cycle[1].\n\nAutomation has played a crucial role in the evolution of DevOps, particularly as businesses moved toward cloud infrastructure. The automation of cloud infrastructure allows for better scalability, monitoring, and efficiency, addressing some of the initial concerns that spurred the DevOps movement[6]. By adopting these automated practices, organizations can streamline their processes, focusing more on application development rather than the complexities of underlying infrastructure management[10].\n\nKey Concepts in DevOps\n\nDevOps is fundamentally a methodology in the software development and IT industry that focuses on the integration and automation of the work performed by software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). This approach is aimed at improving and shortening the systems development life cycle, ensuring that new features and improvements can be delivered to users more efficiently and with higher quality[1].\n\nOne of the core principles of DevOps is shared ownership, where development and operations teams work closely together to foster collaboration, streamline workflows, and enhance communication across all stages of the software delivery process. This cultural shift towards collaboration enables teams to address issues more rapidly and make informed decisions, resulting in a more responsive and agile environment[3][4].\n\nAnother key concept is workflow automation, which involves the use of tools and practices to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This automation is typically achieved through continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, which help businesses achieve shorter development cycles and faster time-to-market. Tools like GitLab CI/CD or Jenkins are widely used for creating and managing these pipelines, thus improving software quality and reducing human error[3][4].\n\nInfrastructure as code (IaC) is another critical element within DevOps, where infrastructure is managed and provisioned through code instead of manual processes. IaC enables consistent and repeatable configurations across environments, facilitates integration with CI/CD pipelines, and supports scalable infrastructure management. This approach ensures that infrastructure changes are aligned with software development, promoting efficiency and reducing the potential for configuration drift[11][12][5] .\n\nMoreover, the use of monitoring and logging practices within a DevOps framework is vital for maintaining system reliability and performance. These practices enable real-time analysis and proactive monitoring, allowing organizations to promptly address issues and ensure the delivery of reliable updates to customers[8]. Through these key concepts, DevOps empowers businesses to accelerate their cloud adoption journey, improve scalability, and maintain a competitive advantage in rapidly changing markets[4].\n\nDevOps Practices in Cloud Infrastructure\n\nDevOps practices play a crucial role in modern cloud infrastructure management by enabling organizations to achieve agility, collaboration, and efficiency throughout the cloud lifecycle. One of the foundational principles of DevOps in cloud environments is the implementation of infrastructure as code (IaC). IaC allows teams to define system resources and topologies in a descriptive manner, which can be stored and versioned in version control systems, offering a reliable, repeatable, and controlled way to deploy system resources[10][5] . This practice ensures that configurations are consistent across environments and can be easily edited and distributed[5] .\n\nAutomation is another pivotal element in DevOps practices, significantly enhancing scalability and efficiency. By fully automating infrastructure installation processes, organizations can eliminate the need for manual server provisioning, middleware building, and application code installation[13]. Tools such as AWS, Azure, GitLab, and Jira are commonly employed to overcome challenges associated with cloud automation, enabling businesses to enhance their scalability and monitoring capabilities[6].\n\nContinuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are also integral to DevOps practices, streamlining the build, testing, and deployment processes. Utilizing CI/CD tools like Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD, organizations can establish a seamless software delivery pipeline, facilitating frequent releases, faster feedback cycles, and improved software quality[3]. This automation minimizes human dependency for managing repetitive tasks, although some human oversight is still necessary when updates or troubleshooting are required[9].\n\nContainerization further simplifies deployment and management within cloud environments. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies into containers, businesses can achieve greater portability and resource utilization. Docker, for instance, allows containers to run on any infrastructure, ensuring consistent application performance across different environments[7].\n\nAchieving Scalability\n\nAchieving scalability in cloud infrastructure is a crucial component of DevOps practices. By leveraging containers, businesses encapsulate applications and their dependencies, which ensures portability and scalability while optimizing resource utilization[3]. This encapsulation simplifies the deployment and management of complex applications, allowing organizations to scale their operations effectively.\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) plays a vital role in scaling cloud infrastructure. IaC involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes, leading to more efficient and repeatable management of development, testing, and production environments[5] [8]. Tools like AWS CloudFormation enable developers to define and manage cloud resources, thus facilitating scaling beyond traditional infrastructure limitations[11].\n\nAutomation is another pivotal element in achieving scalability. Automation tools reduce the need for manual intervention, streamline processes, and allow for more efficient workload management[6][14]. This, in turn, helps DevOps teams increase efficiency and velocity, providing them with better control and visibility over their operations[14].\n\nFurthermore, adopting a microservices architectural style supports scalability. Microservices, characterized by small and independently deployable services, allow for continuous refactoring and scaling of individual services, which contributes to overall system efficiency and reliability[1]. This architectural style is becoming the standard for building systems that are continuously deployed, thus supporting organizational scalability[1].\n\nBest Practices for Automation and Scalability\n\nIn the context of cloud infrastructure management, automation and scalability are pivotal in ensuring efficient operations and fostering innovation. The integration of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) stands out as a primary practice in automating and managing infrastructure at scale. IaC enables developers and system administrators to manage infrastructure through code, treating it akin to application code, which promotes consistency and reduces the risk of human error[8][6]. This code-based approach allows for rapid deployment, updating, and duplication of infrastructure using standardized patterns, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages[8].\n\nOne of the foundational elements of DevOps is the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, which automates the build, test, and deployment processes. This approach streamlines software development, resulting in shorter development cycles and faster time-to-market[3]. The integration of IaC into CI/CD pipelines further enhances these processes by ensuring infrastructure changes are synchronized with software updates, leading to consistently reproducible configurations across different environments[11].\n\nAutomation tools such as AWS, Azure, GitLab, and Jenkins are instrumental in achieving scalability and efficiency in cloud infrastructure. These tools facilitate monitoring, scaling, and managing infrastructure resources, thereby helping businesses maintain a reliable system capable of promptly responding to customer needs and market demands[6][3]. Automation also aids in monitoring IT infrastructure performance, generating alerts for availability, performance, or security issues, which is critical for maintaining the integrity and functionality of fast-moving DevOps environments[9].\n\nAdditionally, embracing a DevOps culture that emphasizes collaboration, ownership, and accountability can improve team dynamics and operational efficiency[8]4]. This cultural shift supports the implementation of agile project management and continuous feedback loops, which are crucial for the evolution of DevOps in achieving both automation and scalability in cloud infrastructure[15].\n\nImpact of DevOps on Cloud Infrastructure Management\n\nThe integration of DevOps practices has significantly transformed cloud infrastructure management by emphasizing automation, collaboration, and scalability. DevOps practices eliminate the traditional need to manually provision servers, build middleware, and install application code, instead relying on automated processes that are documented, repeatable, verifiable, and traceable[13]. This automation not only accelerates infrastructure installation but also enhances reliability and efficiency in managing cloud environments[3].\n\nA fundamental aspect of DevOps is the adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which allows organizations to manage their development, testing, and production environments in a repeatable and efficient manner[8]. IaC minimizes human dependency for managing basic, recurring tasks, thereby reducing risks associated with manual interventions[9]. By implementing continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, organizations can ensure that all changes to code infrastructure and application updates are both safe and functional, promoting a seamless transition from development to production environments[4].\n\nMoreover, DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration among software developers and operations teams, which leads to improved processes that save both time and money[4]. This collaborative culture is supported by powerful tools for configuration management, containerization, and CI/CD, which together empower businesses to achieve greater agility and efficiency throughout the cloud lifecycle[3].\n\nDespite its advantages, the transformation to a DevOps model requires careful oversight and human intervention when necessary. Even well-automated processes can encounter unforeseen issues that necessitate human expertise to resolve[9]. Nevertheless, the emphasis on automation within DevOps remains a cornerstone of effective cloud infrastructure management, enabling organizations to scale their operations efficiently and respond promptly to customer needs[4][9].\n\nCase Studies\n\nAdoption of Automation in DevOps\n\nOne prominent case study illustrating the transformation brought by DevOps in cloud infrastructure management is that of a large-scale financial services firm. The organization faced challenges in managing complex systems and ensuring rapid deployment without compromising stability. By adopting DevOps practices, particularly focusing on automation, they achieved a more streamlined workflow. The implementation of automated testing\u2014encompassing unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests\u2014was pivotal in reducing deployment errors and improving the speed of delivery[15][16].\n\nThe firm utilized infrastructure as code to manage their environments, enabling them to replicate development, testing, and production setups efficiently. This approach not only reduced risks associated with system changes but also promoted consistency across environments[8]. As a result, the company experienced enhanced scalability in their cloud infrastructure, allowing them to adapt swiftly to changing demands.\n\nCultural Shift and Performance Metrics\n\nAnother case study involves an e-commerce company that embraced DevOps to overcome the inefficiencies inherent in their legacy systems. A crucial aspect of their transition was the cultural shift towards continuous communication and trust within teams. The company focused on breaking down silos and fostering a culture where ownership and accountability were emphasized[16][8].\n\nThe 2023 State of DevOps report noted that the company adopted updated performance metrics to better assess the effectiveness of their deployments. The switch from \u201cmean time to recover\u201d to \u201cfailed deployment recovery time\u201d provided clearer insights into their system\u2019s resilience, addressing previous ambiguities[1]. This metric adjustment was part of a broader strategy to implement Lean and Agile methodologies, contributing to the company\u2019s improved ability to respond to market demands swiftly.\n\nThese case studies exemplify how organizations have leveraged DevOps to enhance their cloud infrastructure management through automation and cultural transformation, achieving greater scalability and operational efficiency[17][1][8].\n\nFuture Trends in DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure\n\nThe future of DevOps in cloud infrastructure is poised for significant evolution, driven by the continuous advancements in automation and scalability. As organizations strive for greater agility and efficiency, the integration of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) will become even more prevalent. This approach allows teams to manage infrastructure using code, creating consistent and reliable environments while reducing human error through automation [6][8]. The adoption of IaC is expected to deepen, facilitating the deployment of infrastructure using standardized patterns that are repeatable, verifiable, and traceable [13].\n\nAutomation tools will continue to play a crucial role in managing complex environments at scale. With the increasing demand for seamless operations, these tools will help teams handle the velocity of changes characteristic of DevOps practices [8]. Furthermore, the use of containerization and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines will likely become more widespread, particularly with the rise of Kubernetes. Automating the processes of building, deploying, and monitoring containers will be essential, allowing teams to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management[10].\n\nMicroservices architecture is anticipated to become more dominant in the DevOps landscape, given its compatibility with continuous deployment systems. The modular nature of microservices allows for iterative and rapid development, aligning well with DevOps principles [1]. This architectural style will likely be complemented by serverless computing, which reduces the complexity of deployment and operations by eliminating the need for server configuration and maintenance [10].\n\nAs cloud providers continue to innovate, DevOps teams will benefit from enhanced services that streamline application lifecycles and accelerate product delivery. For example, AWS offers various services tailored for DevOps, enabling developers and system administrators to automate operational tasks efficiently [8][18]. The ongoing evolution of cloud services will empower organizations to maximize their cloud adoption journey and achieve sustainable success through DevOps[3].\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Wikipedia contributors.

            "article_content": "A humungous beast of an animal was discovered in the Amazon rainforest in early 2024, leaving the explorer that found it in awe.\n\nDescribed as being 'as thick as a car tire', the creature was discovered by scientist Professor Freek Vonk among others, who revealed that the animal weighed over 200 kilograms.\n\nAs seen in the viral video, the creature is actually the largest snake in the world, and it was found in the Amazon rainforest (no shock there).\n\nAdvert\n\nIf you're wondering exactly how big it is, look no further:\n\nThe colossal snake wowed thousands on social media, after the professor shared his jaw-dropping discovery with his Instagram followers.\n\nProfessor Vonk highlighted during the video that it was one of the largest snakes he'd ever seen in his life, describing it as 'massive' and a 'monster'.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe also claimed that the new species means that the largest snake species in the world does not only have one variation.\n\nThe scientist explained: \u201cTogether with 14 other scientists from nine countries I have described a NEW snake species from the Amazon today. And not just one. A massive snake!\n\n\"We\u2019ve discovered that the largest snake species in the world, the green anaconda - as we all know it from the movies and all the stories about giant snakes - actually consists of two different species!\n\n\u201cThe green anacondas that occur in the northern part of their range in South America (including Venezuela, Suriname, and French Guyana) turn out to be a completely different species!\n\nAdvert\n\n\"Even though they look almost identical to the eye, the genetic difference between the two is 5.5%, and that is huge.\n\n\"To put this in perspective: humans and chimps are genetically different only about 2% from each other.\u201d\n\nThe professor couldn't believe that the discovered species was part of the largest in the world (Instagram/@freekvonk)\n\nVonk continued: \u201cThe biggest anaconda I've ever seen can be seen in the video, as thick as a car tire, eight meters long and over 200 kg heavy - with a head as big as my head. From total awe and admiration a 'monster'!\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve discovered a new species before, but that was a small snake from Australia. Now it's about a mythical and legendary animal!\n\n\"Definitely one of the highlights of my scientific career. Also because this snake can be found in the Amazon, a place that feels like home to me.\u201d\n\nThe Dutch Professor, who is also a TV presenter, used the discovery to highlight the impact of climate change on the area that it was found, saying that it was \u2018heavily under pressure from climate change and the ever-lasting deforestation of primary rainforest\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u201cAlready over a fifth of the Amazon has disappeared, that's more than 30x the area of the Netherlands.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThe survival of these iconic giant snakes is inseparable to protecting their natural habitat. This study highlights how efficient we need to be on our largest tropical rainforest in the world.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Look, sometimes the stereotypes do get us \u2013 plenty of us simply can\u2019t go without our phones.\n\nAnd that includes taking them into the bathroom with us while we have a shower. Perhaps you\u2019re worried you\u2019ll miss out on an important call, or worse, be left out of the jokes in the group chat. Maybe you just use it to provide the backing music while you give the daily performance of a lifetime while you wash.\n\nBut for whatever reason you\u2019re taking your tech in there with you (and I hope not taking it into the actual shower), a grim warning has been issued that might put you off the habit.\n\nAdvert\n\nA steamy bathroom could be the wrong place for your phone (Getty Stock)\n\nTikTok creator Andi, who goes by \u2018your beauty best friend\u2019 shared the pretty gross discovery she made after regularly taking her device into the bathroom.\n\nIt led to her making a \u2018little PSA\u2019 for those who don\u2019t have a \u2018clear phone case\u2019.\n\n\u201cI usually take this phone to the shower, to listen to music while I'm taking a shower,\u201d she explained, showing her iPhone, caseless.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd in a dramatic move, she then picks up its case, showing how grim the inside of it is.\n\nUsers encouraged cleaning your device. ((Getty Stock)\n\nOnce a shade of light pink, it is absolutely coated with speckles of black mould, shadowed totally in damp. Honestly, it\u2019s actually disgusting.\n\nIt might not be something you\u2019ve really considered, but of course keeping your device in the bathroom while the steam from your shower circulates, means it is sitting in the perfect place for mould to grow.\n\nAdvert\n\nSo, like in Andi\u2019s case, full on fungus can grow in the case due to the humidity and lack of ventilation.\n\nWhile some commenters said it\u2019s a \u2018common sense thing\u2019, others suggested it could be more than just having it in the bathroom.\n\n\u201cIf y\u2019all aren\u2019t cleaning your phone cases I think you\u2019re nasty AF. Like your phone touches everything and then touches your face of course you should wash it?\u201d one slammed.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut another shared that despite cleaning their phone \u2018weekly\u2019 with alcohol wipes: \u201cOh my god not me discovering the exact same thing 2 days ago and telling my best friend and then him sending me this today?!?? Glad I\u2019m not alone.\u201d\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThis just happened to mine too!! Same kind of case,\u201d another wrote as the creator explained it was a rubber case and it seemed \u2018the humidity from the shower got inside\u2019.\n\nOn Reddit, users echoed the urges to make sure you clean phones \u2018more often\u2019.\n\nAccording to the US Federal Communications Commission, health experts advise cleaning your phone every day using a lint-free cloth slightly dampened with soap and water, taking care to keep moisture away from any openings in the device."

            "source": "Willamette Week",
            "article_content": "Last month, on the night of Dec. 7, multiple pilots saw lights in the sky over the Willamette Valley.\n\nAs several outlets reported, an audio recording of air traffic control that went viral features alarm over the lights\u2019 strange movements among pilots of two commercial airliners, United Flight 1596 and Horizon Air Flight 2207, the latter of which had a pilot who reported having seen the same phenomenon \u201ca few times over the last month in the same area\u201d near Eugene.\n\nWhatever they were seeing, it wasn\u2019t showing up on air traffic control\u2019s radar. It was, however, appearing on the crash avoidance system of a small Life Flight plane, Medevac 1LF, heading toward North Bend. Its pilot, Joe Buley, gave the most detailed description:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one way up high and one about at my altitude. Moving in\u2026like a corkscrew pattern. Moving at\u2026extreme speeds... It\u2019s a red circular shape and it keeps zipping out towards the ocean and then coming back in, about 20 miles or closer to us and then zips back out of the ocean.\u201d\n\nThe response from air traffic control: \u201cYou are cleared to maneuver as necessary\u2014a left or right to avoid the UFO out there.\u201d\n\nThis incident was not, by any stretch of the imagination, the first time anybody\u2019s reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. This isn\u2019t even the first time that a United Airlines flight has reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. The region has been an epicenter of postwar UFO sightings, with more people having reported sightings in Portland and Seattle than in any other metro area in the United States since 2000. (The U.S. government now designates such sightings as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d or UAPs.)\n\nIt was here that on June 24, 1947, an amateur pilot named Kenneth Arnold set off a national frenzy after he reported seeing \u201cnine saucerlike aircraft flying in formation\u201d above Southwest Washington while flying from Chehalis to Yakima. (Thus, like \u201cgrunge\u201d and \u201cvegan strip club,\u201d \u201cflying saucer\u201d became a product of the Pacific Northwest.) Ten days later, the crew of United Flight 105 reported a nearly identical experience while flying from Boise to Pendleton.\n\nIn 1950, an Oregon couple named Paul and Evelyn Trent took two pictures on their Kodak of a \u201cdisc-shaped object\u201d that supposedly hovered above their farm outside of McMinnville without emitting any sound. The pictures ended up in Life magazine and remain a point of contention between UFO skeptics and believers.\n\nIn the 75 years since, there\u2019ve been thousands of reported sightings across the Pacific Northwest. Regardless of personal opinions of such things, it\u2019s undeniable that during this time UFOs and little green men have embedded themselves into the cultural fabric of the region, another stitch alongside New Age crystal healers, Bigfoot true believers, and whatever it is that draws people to a full-size replica of Stonehenge on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge. McMinnville and Chehalis both now hold annual UFO festivals; the Royal Canadian Mint issues a coin commemorating a 1970 sighting in British Columbia.\n\nWhat happened last month over the valley, though, was different from anything else that\u2019s come before. The Dec. 7 incident represented legitimate documentation of multiple professional pilots seeing the same things and having the same reaction to them. In that audio recording, an unnamed pilot aboard Horizon Air Flight 2207 can be heard refuting what\u2019s become the standard explanation for what they saw\u2014satellites. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not Starlink, I promise,\u201d he says. \u201cI know what that looks like.\u201d Buley, the pilot of Medevac 1LF, also doubts this explanation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen satellites\u2026stuff like that. This was definitely different,\u201d he told KEZI-TV. (WW reached out to Life Flight Network but was told that Buley and the rest of his crew have declined to speak further on the matter.)\n\nIt\u2019s all very strange. Perhaps the UFO believers are right after all. If they are, and this is a real thing, then the greatest story of all time has been playing out above our backyard. Or maybe it\u2019s nothing at all."
