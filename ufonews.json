        "article_content": "The horror of mutilated cattle, cheeks cut off on one side, tongues missing, sexual organs removed, bloodless carcasses and no visible signs of predation made big, bold headlines across Wyoming and the West in mid-1970s.\n\nWyoming had reports of cattle mutilated in Newcastle in the Bridger Valley in Uinta County and in Sublette County. There were mutilated horses in Meeteetse and Carbon County. Two years later there was a report of a heifer outside Casper found dead under similar circumstances.\n\nIn the years immediately after the Vietnam War and Watergate, suspects included the U.S. military, who some surmised were conducting experiments or collecting tissue, satanic cults or UFO visitations.\n\nEfforts by a Nebraska senator to get the FBI involved were met with hesitation and reluctance from the agency, which only fueled speculation. The mystery has lingered for decades, still spooking ranchers and former law enforcement officers as Halloween approaches, reminding them of a real horror they lived through.\n\n\u201cIt lasted in our area three years,\u201d former Uinta County Sheriff Leonard Hysell told Cowboy State Daily in an interview. \u201cThe first year we had it was an ungodly amount of them, a lot.\u201d\n\nWhile the headlines died off in the 1980s, reports of periodic cattle mutilations have continued. In Texas six cows were mutilated in similar fashion in 2023. Mutilations that occurred in eastern Oregon communities in recent years were profiled on Netflix\u2019s latest season of \u201cUnsolved Mysteries.\u201d\n\nCurrent Wyoming Livestock Growers Association Executive Vice President Jim Magagna and Wyoming State Veterinarian Dr. Hollie Hasel said they know of no reports of incidents of mutilation in the state since they assumed their respective roles.\n\nThe Mutilations Begin\n\nBut in the 1970s, the losses were real and the ranchers and law enforcement were at a loss to find a culprit or motive for the grotesque mutilations in the Cowboy State and rest of the country.\n\nThe Casper Star-Tribune reported on Oct. 26, 1975, that suspected cattle mutilations surpassed 45 cows with 10 in Sublette County and 16 in Uinta County. On Sept. 30, the paper reported on a calf north of Gillette with its sexual organs cut off and the stomach cut with a sharp instrument.\n\nThe Campbell County Sheriff\u2019s Office characterized the death as a \u201cconfirmed mutilation\u201d after a veterinarian could not determine the cause of death and there were no signs or tracks of predators or humans.\n\nFor Hysell, then Uinta County undersheriff, the incidents represented the most bizarre cases he investigated in his 47-year law enforcement career, including 20 years in Uinta County.\n\n\u201cWe only took the ones that were fresh kills, anything that was over 24 hours old we didn\u2019t try to speculate on that,\u201d he said. \u201cFresh kills we really tried to investigate. We racked up a large number of them. One rancher alone had 16 head, six in one night in one pasture. Now the predators are not doing that.\u201d\n\nEvidence Of Helicopters\n\nWhile many news stories speak of the lack of evidence and tracks around the kills, Hysell said he did find certain evidence at some of the sites that led to his suspicions about the cause \u2014 and it involved helicopters.\n\nDuring the period when cattle were being discovered mutilated, there were credible reports of military-style helicopters in the area and, on one occasion, three in different locations. Hysell said the aircraft had no numbers on the side, did not use lights and were only seen at dusk.\n\n\u201cWe found a lot of rotor wash around the carcasses, we found the marks of the landing skids,\u201d he said. \u201cThat led me to believe it was something a little more involved. And predators wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with those carcasses. Birds wouldn\u2019t peck on them. We never had any incidents like that before and we never had any after. If it was predators, why didn\u2019t it continue on? It just didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 3, 1975, the Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph reported that El Paso County Undersheriff Gary Gibbs pointed to a satanic cult.\n\n\u201cThey are nomadic people. In the past two years we\u2019ve found evidence of similar happenings in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. This isn\u2019t a small group. There are several thousand members across the country,\u201d he was quoted. \u201cSome people laugh at the idea, but we have been working very hard on the problem and we have definite evidence. We want to catch these people because we don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do when they tire of mutilating cows.\u201d\n\nHysell said the cult theory was not something he agreed with because of the money it took to operate the helicopters he knows were flying in and around his county at the time. But he does know that the federal government and state agencies were extremely reluctant to help sheriff departments across the West. And that included in Wyoming.\n\n\u201cThe state crime labs wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with anything either in Wyoming or in Utah,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard from other sheriff offices that that was the case they were running up against in all of their states.\u201d\n\nThe Casper Star-Tribune reported in April 1978 about a cow mutilated near Casper. (Courtesy Newspapers.com)\n\nThe Casper Star-Tribune reported in September 1975 about a calf mutilated near Gillette. (Courtesy Newspapers.com)\n\nLeft, the Casper Star-Tribune carried an article in October 1977 showing the extent of the cattle mutilation across the nation. Right, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported on cattle mutilations in September 1994. (Courtesy Newspapers.com) Arrow left Arrow right\n\nFBI File\n\nAn FBI file on the cattle mutilations reveals letters that were sent by Nebraska Sen. Carl Curtis to FBI Director Clarence M. Kelly in 1974 seeking the federal agency\u2019s help with solving the crimes.\n\n\u201cThis will refer to my previous letter of August 21 to you regarding the series of incidents stretching from Oklahoma to Nebraska in which cattle have been dismembered in some kind of strange witchcraft cult,\u201d Curtis wrote. \u201cI am wondering if your good offices have instigated an investigation of this situation either in Nebraska or any of the other states experiencing similar acts of mutilation to livestock.\u201d\n\nThe FBI director replied on Sept. 10, 1974, that he had an agent check into the matter and it appeared \u201cno federal law within the jurisdiction of the FBI has been violated.\u201d\n\nBy 1979, Sen. Harrison Schmitt of New Mexico succeeded in getting the Senate Appropriations Committee to include language in its report directing the FBI to \u201cmaintain its investigation of the cattle mutilations that have occurred in New Mexico and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nRetired FBI agent Kenneth Rommel led an investigation into cattle mutilated on a native reservation in New Mexico and concluded that it was predators that were to blame.\n\n\u201cMost credible sources have attributed this damage to normal predator and scavenger activity. However certain segments of the population have attributed the damage to other causes ranging from UFOs to a giant government conspiracy,\u201d Rommel wrote in a letter to the FBI on March 5, 1980. \u201cNo factual data has been supplied supporting these theories.\u201d\n\nRommel did send in flakes of material that appeared on top of a Taos, N.M.. pickup truck in July 1978 after a UFO allegedly hovered over it. The FBI lab concluded it was white enamel paint, typical of exterior house paint and that the particles \u201cappear to have originated from a wood substrate.\u201d\n\nPredator Conclusion \u2018Not Valid\u2019\n\nHysell said he did not accept the FBI\u2019s conclusion about predators.\n\n\u201cI never met too many FBI agents that knew much about predators, at least the four-legged kind,\u201d he said. \u201cI totally thought that conclusion was not valid.\u201d\n\nHysell said he suspected that the government was involved in the mutilations possibly due to a chemical or biological mishap and it needed to test to see how extensive the material had spread.\n\n\u201cThere were mutilations of any place where air, water or food could enter or exit the bodies,\u201d he said.\n\nAn article in the Casper Star-Tribune on Oct. 23, 1977, quoted a spokesman for the national Cattlemen\u2019s Association who estimated 3,000 mutilations had been reported across 22 states beginning in late 1974 through a peak in the summers of 1975 and 1976.\n\nOne facility in Utah known to be involved in chemical and biological weapons is the Dugway Proving Ground located 85 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nA congressional report by the Committee on Veteran\u2019s Affairs and Chairman John D. Rockefeller IV on Dec. 8, 1994, stated that the proving ground had been the site of testing for various chemical and biological agents.\n\nIn 1968, the report stated that 6,400 sheep near the facility died following \u201cthe intentional release of a deadly nerve gas from a plane.\u201d\n\n\u201cInitially the Defense Department denied any responsibility for the accident \u2026 However, the nerve agent VX was identified when the poisoned sheep were autopsied, which made it clear the deaths were not caused by pesticides,\u201d the report stated. \u201cEventually, the Defense Department reimbursed the ranchers for their animals.\u201d\n\nWhile cattle mutilations were making headlines across the county in the mid-1970s, the mutilations have still occurred in recent years. (Courtesy Bovinevetonline.com)\n\n\u2018Simulant Testing\u2019\n\nAfter the 1968 deaths, the report stated the Department of Defense developed \u201csimulant\u201d testing. But during \u201c45-years\u201d of open-air testing, \u201cthe Army has stopped using a variety of simulants when they realized they were not as safe as believed,\u201d the report stated.\n\nWhile the mass mutilations of the mid-70s have stopped, reports of similar mutilations still occur. One of the most recent reports involved six cattle mutilations in Texas.\n\nA press release on May 23, 2023, by the Animal Legal Defense Fund reported that a 6-year-old longhorn-cross cow was discovered in April 2023 in Madison County with its tongue removed by a \u201cstraight, clean cut with apparent precision along the jawline. Scavenging animals did not touch the body.\n\nFive additional cows were discovered with their anus and sexual organs removed in addition to the tongues in neighboring Brazos and Robertson counties.\n\nThe investigator into the Madison County incident told Cowboy State Daily she could not speak to the media without the sheriff\u2019s approval. A message left with the sheriff was not responded to by deadline.\n\nAs Hysell looks back on the mid-70s and the collaboration with sheriff departments across the West, he recalls that a lot of people were \u201cridiculed\u201d as they tried to find the answers.\n\n\u201cI felt like we were being controlled with the news of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI will tell you this at least in one case, I won\u2019t tell you which state it was in, a person who worked in the crime lab, they were told to back off of it, that they would not accept any more samples and they were to shut up about it.\u201d\n\nDale Killingbeck can be reached at dale@cowboystatedaily.com."

        "article_content": "Oct. 25\u2014When it comes to aliens, space exploration and the existential questions that arise around unearthly what-ifs, New Hampshire loves both the science and the fiction.\n\nJust don't tell anyone in Exeter the lore around the 1965 UFO sighting may be part of the fiction.\n\n\"The Incident at Exeter,\" which really took place in Kensington, birthed its own annual festival, which has been drawing up to 6,000 believers for more than a decade. But there's much more to it than that.\n\nThere's the should-be-obvious \u2014 the first American in space and fifth man to walk on the moon was Derry's Alan Shepard. And the not-so-obvious \u2014 a U.S. Space Force base is in rural New Boston and an 82-foot-wide dish in the middle of nowhere in Hancock is mapping the universe and tracking asteroids.\n\nAdd in Betty and Barney Hill's reported 1961 close encounter with aliens in the White Mountains, and Christa McAuliffe's star-crossed selection as America's first teacher in space, and it's clear New Hampshire has a deep connection with the cosmos.\n\nAs Exeter's Bob Cox likes to say, alien and space stories have captured the state's imagination because many residents were around for Shepard's flights, the 1965 sighting, and major advances in space exploration.\n\n\"I think it's unique because (the UFO sighting) happened here in 1965. It's not like it happened over a 100 or so years ago,\" said Cox, who is one of the organizers of the Exeter Area Kiwanis Club's UFO Festival, held every Labor Day weekend.\n\nThe incident\n\nSo what exactly happened in Exeter \u2014 er, Kensington?\n\nFirst off, the location has never been in dispute, but back then Exeter police were the first on the scene in Kensington because the tiny town didn't have its own department.\n\nAs Cox tells it, on Sept. 3, 1965, Norman Muscarello was hitchhiking home from seeing his girlfriend and \"got a ride into the Kensington area. When they approached Kensington, they saw a light in the field.\"\n\nThe 18-year-old Muscarello told the Exeter police he saw a flying object behind a barn. When police arrived, they saw an object hovering in the spot Muscarello had described.\n\n\"They took him in a squad car and drove back out there and they saw it too,\" Cox said.\n\nPolice and investigators from across the U.S. tried to figure out what happened.\n\nOfficials at nearby Pease Air Force Base told local law enforcement the UFO was related to a test they were running on aircraft, Cox said.\n\n\"One of the policemen who was on the police force at the time was honored at our last festival. There are people in town and in surrounding communities who actually lived through this,\" Cox said.\n\nCox, who moved to New Hampshire in 1978, said there have been UFO sightings all over the area.\n\n\"I've got to admit, I hadn't really thought about UFOs until I got involved with this,\" the 82-year-old said.\n\nThe dish\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation's National Radio Astronomy Observatory Very Long Baseline Array (a name almost as long as the program's reach) operates a huge antenna in the woods of Hancock.\n\nThe VLBA, for short, is a network of 10 radio telescopes from Hawaii to New Hampshire. The antennas work together as one enormous telescope through a process called interferometry.\n\nAstronomers can point all the telescopes at the same object in space to collect data for high-resolution images of things millions of light years away from Earth in \"unprecedented detail,\" said Jill Malusky, a spokesperson for the program.\n\n\"The VLBA is important because there is no other instrument of its kind in the U.S. \u2014 one that spans nearly 5,000 miles,\" Malusky said.\n\nRadio telescopes are different from optical telescopes because they collect signals humans cannot see. They can also be used during daylight hours and \"see\" through dust.\n\n\"Space is actually very dusty,\" Malusky said.\n\nThe VLBA has been around for 31 years and has collected all kinds of interesting data, she said.\n\nBut can the Hancock antenna find aliens?\n\n\"Everyone asks about aliens. I think it's fun,\" Malusky said. \"Yes, it can relate to finding life in the universe, but not in an action-movie type of way.\"\n\nRadio telescopes can find clues of extraterrestrial life by seeing the building blocks of life or by searching for non-organic signals created by intelligent life, she said.\n\nAlthough the telescope network has found organic molecules, it hasn't found any evidence of otherworldly beings yet.\n\nFor a practical application though, look no further than global positioning systems.\n\n\"Believe it or not, the VLBA helps make your GPS work. The VLBA was created in part by (and is often used by) the U.S. Naval Observatory for critical measurements of Earth's orientation, which is essential for the accurate functioning of GPS systems,\" she said.\n\nThe base\n\nThe New Boston Space Force Station (SFS) has been operational for more than 60 years in several different capacities\n\nPart of the five-year-old U.S. Space Force, which has its headquarters in Colorado, the base is part of a network of sites operating 24 hours a day. It provides satellite command and control capability to hundreds of military, government and civilian satellites performing intelligence, weather, navigation, early-warning and communications operations.\n\nThe base was \"originally established in 1942 as a practice area for bombers and fighter planes from nearby Grenier Army Air Field (which has since become Manchester \u2014 Boston Regional Airport). Starting in 1959, it was turned into a satellite-tracking station,\" according to the station's website. It was transferred from the Air Force to the new Space Force in 2020.\n\nThe Space Force now has dozens of bases in 11 time zones. New Hampshire's base comprises nearly 3,000 acres and is the largest outside of the Colorado hub.\n\nFolks in New Boston like to call their town the unofficial \"gravity center of the world.\" Residents revel in their fascination with aliens, decorating several floats during this year's Fourth of July parade with blow-up alien costume, stuffed cows caught in tractor beams, and references to the movie \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.\"\n\nThe man\n\nThere'd be no Pinkerton Academy Astros and Derry wouldn't be called \"Spacetown\" if not for Shepard, one of the Mercury Seven astronauts who made his landmark exit from Earth in 1961 aboard Freedom 7.\n\nHe was also the commander of Apollo 14 in 1971, the fourth of NASA's seven planned moon-landing missions.\n\nShepard also famously drove two golf balls from the lunar surface, but they didn't go quite as far as legend would have it.\n\nTo this day, though, the Derry police sport shoulder patches displaying a space capsule orbiting the moon and Pinkerton continues to name things after its most famous alum.\n\nShepard was also a central figure in the popular book \"The Right Stuff\" by Tom Wolfe, its movie adaptation (Shepard was played by Scott Glenn) and TV shows that followed about the American space program.\n\nFrom Earth to the moon, New Hampshire has played a strikingly significant role in space science, and for those whose mantra is \"I want to believe.\"\n\ndpierce@unionleader.com"

        "article_content": "AI can assist everywhere from your email apps to fast food outlets. Now Amazon is keen to be involved in the AI revolution with an AI bot called Rufus, which can answer questions, research products, and help you make the right buying decisions across Amazon.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re stuck for a gift idea for someone special in your life, or you need to compare two products against each other. From asking about your active orders to checking up on the details of something you\u2019re thinking about buying, Rufus can help\u2014and here\u2019s how you can find it.\n\nHow Rufus works, and where to find it\n\nRufus might offer prompt suggestions based on your browsing history. Screenshot: Amazon\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini, Rufus is very much along the same lines. It\u2019s trained on \u201cAmazon\u2019s extensive product catalog, customer reviews, community Q&As, and information from across the web\u201d, which it then sifts through, connects together, and summarizes to respond to your questions.\n\nThese bots, however, don\u2019t just copy and paste information\u2014they\u2019re designed to generate fresh and original responses, so (as always with these AI models) mistakes can be made. Amazon says Rufus \u201cmay not always get things right,\u201d so it\u2019s worth double-checking important details\u2014don\u2019t assume everything Rufus sells is 100 percent correct, and don\u2019t share private or personal information with it.\n\nIf you\u2019re using the Amazon Shopping app for Android or iOS, you\u2019ll find Rufus on the right of the navigation bar at the bottom (the Rufus logo is two blobs with a star next to them): Tap the button to bring up a chat window and start asking questions. If you\u2019re shopping through the Amazon website, you\u2019ll see the Rufus button up on the left-hand side of the toolbar at the top.\n\nStraight away, Rufus will make suggestions about questions to ask\u2014some of these may be related to recent searches or recent purchases. Click or tap on any of the suggestions, or enter your own question or prompt, and Rufus springs into action.\n\nAfter each response, you get the opportunity to ask follow-up questions (Rufus will remember the conversation history), and rate the responses you\u2019ve been given (via the thumbs up or thumbs down buttons). You can clear your chat history in Rufus, but only in the app, and not on the web: Tap on the three dots (top right), then choose Manage chat and Clear chat history.\n\nQuestions and prompts to try with Rufus\n\nOne of the ways to use the bot is to ask questions about products. Screenshot: Amazon\n\nRufus knows what you\u2019re looking at on the Amazon platform, so you can ask it questions about a product you\u2019ve got up on screen. You can ask how much an item weighs, for example, or which materials it\u2019s made of, or what the battery life is like. In some cases, the bot will make direct reference to something in the listing.\n\nGoing beyond individual product pages, Rufus can answer shopping questions more generally. You might want to ask what the best tool is for a particular job, or how two specific items compare to each other, or what a certain item actually does (and how). You can ask about trends in product categories as well\u2014and see what\u2019s proving popular with other shoppers, for instance.\n\nYou can get quite creative with these questions. For example, you\u2019re able to ask about the tools and materials needed to make a garden shed, or about presents that would be suitable for a 5-year-old child\u2019s birthday, or about extras you might need for a dinner party. Any kind of advice you need, Rufus will attempt to give you some pointers.\n\nThis is where Rufus becomes more like other generative AI chatbots out there: If you\u2019re stuck for shopping inspiration, or you\u2019re not sure how two types of TV tech compare, then you can get answers. The questions you ask don\u2019t have to be specifically about what\u2019s being sold on Amazon, though you are quite likely to see links to see some related items on the site anyway.\n\nFinally, you can also chat with Rufus about the status of your current orders, or the last time you ordered (for example) packing tape. Sometimes you\u2019ll get a direct answer, and sometimes you\u2019ll be given a link for a relevant page on the Amazon site to follow. And if you\u2019re wondering how Amazon came up with the name, by the way, then it\u2019s to do with one of Amazon\u2019s earliest employees."

        "article_content": "Elon Musk\u2019s social media app X is supercharging the spread of voter-fraud conspiracy theories with the help of artificial intelligence, boosting unfounded claims including two personal smears against Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe dubious content is spreading in the app\u2019s \u201cexplore\u201d section, which says it uses Musk\u2019s AI software, named Grok, to aggregate trending social media topics. The information does not appear to be fact-checked by humans, and in several recent examples it seemed to repeat false or unsubstantiated claims as if they were true.\n\nThe feature is named \u201cstories for you\u201d and has a label saying it\u2019s in a beta test, meaning it\u2019s an experiment not available to all users. Each \u201cstory for you\u201d consists of a feed of posts related to a trending topic. On the desktop version of X, users can also see a paragraph-long summary of the topic written by the Grok software if they look at the history of the \u201cstory for you.\u201d\n\nThe feature\u2019s placement in X\u2019s explore section gives it prominent digital real estate in the final weeks of the presidential election, in which Musk is backing former President Donald Trump. Its repeated amplification of misinformation and conspiracy theories related to the election follows a string of instances where Musk has personally shared similar ideas, both in live appearances and on his social media.\n\nGet top local stories in Southern California delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC LA's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn the past week, NBC News identified five \u201cstories for you\u201d that pushed baseless claims related to the election.\n\nEach trending topic curated by Grok includes a warning disclaiming any responsibility for accuracy and telling users to check facts on their own: \u201cGrok can make mistakes, verify its outputs,\u201d the disclaimer says.\n\nOn Monday, Grok uncritically repeated debunked allegations of wrongdoing related to the voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems. Grok produced a \u201cstory for you\u201d titled \u201cPublic Scrutiny of Dominion Voting Systems,\u201d which aggregated posts accusing the company of \u201celection rigging\u201d and \u201cfraud.\u201d Dominion has previously denounced similar accusations as lies, and last year Fox News agreed to pay $787.5 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion.\n\nGrok\u2019s written summary of the online debate accused Dominion of \u201cpotentially stifling legitimate discussions on election security\u201d through \u201clegal threats.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Grok parroted unfounded claims of wrongdoing in Maricopa County, Arizona, boosting a claim by an X user that county election workers are \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of the speed at which they count ballots.\n\nAnd in a third election-related \u201cstory for you,\u201d Grok this week spread the unsupported claim that a voting machine in Tarrant County, Texas, was \u201cflipping\u201d votes. X\u2019s AI software promoted posts alleging that there were multiple examples, but only one voter came forward and his claim was not verified. Local officials said there was no evidence behind his claim, suggesting that he may have unintentionally pressed the wrong candidate. They say he was able to successfully cast the vote he intended to after he reviewed his ballot.\n\nGrok has also spread smears against Harris, the Democratic nominee for president. It created a \u201cstory for you\u201d repeating unfounded allegations by X users that she used cocaine in the White House, and it created a \u201cstory for you\u201d repeating allegations by X users that she attended parties hosted by Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who\u2019s facing federal sex-abuse charges. Fact-checkers have said a photo of Combs with fashion designer Misa Hylton was altered to add Harris\u2019 face.\n\nSome of the posts aggregated by Grok have millions of views, though it\u2019s not clear if the bulk of the views came before or after Grok included the posts in the trending feature.\n\nThe Environmental Voter Project says more than 130,000 first-time voters, who prioritize climate change, have already cast ballots. Combined with the impacts of extreme weather and climate change, they could decide this election. National climate reporter Chase Cain shows us where climate voters could have the most influence.\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has shared some of the same conspiracy theories amplified by his Grok software, including the unfounded allegations of wrongdoing related to Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nThe world\u2019s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Musk has poured nearly $75 million into a super PAC in support of Trump, and he has crisscrossed battleground state Pennsylvania in a drive to register pro-Trump voters and turn them out to the polls, using a $1 million daily giveaway to get people\u2019s attention.\n\nNBC News sought comment from X about its \u201cstories for you\u201d feature. Representatives for X did not respond to a list of emailed questions.\n\nA spokesperson for Dominion Voting Systems had no immediate comment on X\u2019s \u201cstories for you\u201d feature but pointed to a company website that defends the accuracy of the company\u2019s systems.\n\nRepresentatives for the Harris campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe feature has been problematic in the past. In July, Grok-written summaries boosted false information about President Joe Biden, helping to spread wild conspiracy theories that Biden had an undisclosed medical emergency, might be dying, had been murdered or would be murdered soon.\n\nIt\u2019s a job that used to be done by human curators as recently as two years ago, before Musk bought the app then known as Twitter. In 2015, Twitter\u2019s management rolled out curated trending topics as a way to help users make sense of the flood of information on the app. Twitter employees added verified context from traditional news sources such as The Associated Press and Reuters, in an attempt to elevate the quality of information that was trending.\n\nBut Musk, in one of his first acts after buying Twitter, eliminated the jobs of human curators, and now the tech billionaire has delegated the task to his AI software.\n\nMusk is a frequent critic of the traditional news media, including The Associated Press and Reuters, and he has promoted X as the internet\u2019s most trustworthy news source despite the factual errors, conspiracy theories and debunked claims that appear there.\n\nX launched the experiment in AI-written summaries months ago, and although it has received little attention, some users quickly expressed alarm about the Grok-authored text they were seeing in the beta test of the app\u2019s \u201cexplore\u201d section. One Reddit user in April compared the trending topic summaries to rolling \u201cbrainless AI dice.\u201d And in July, an X user posted a screenshot of \u201cexplore beta\u201d with text asserting that Biden would be the next coach of England\u2019s national soccer team.\n\nIn recent weeks, dozens of X users have posted about \u201cexplore beta,\u201d and the vast majority of the posts have been negative. One user said it was pointless, and another said it was \u201cabsolute trash.\u201d But several said they knew of no way to opt out of the beta test.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many people see the AI-created summaries. Some X users who browse the app\u2019s trending topics see only ranked lists of popular subjects, with no AI-generated text. It\u2019s also not clear if X plans to expand the Grok summaries from a beta test to a standard feature.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com. Read more from NBC News here:"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nYoung Ng Chun-yeong, former chairman of the Association for Geoconservation and a key proponent of the geopark designation, said he expected the discovery to reignite public interest in geoscience and deliver long-term benefits to academia.\n\n\u201cBefore having the geopark, most people thought that Hong Kong was mainly a city and a concrete forest, without paying special attention to the natural rock foundations that we have,\u201d said Ng, who now chairs an ecotourism strategy reference group of the Australian Geoscience Council.\n\n\u201cNow that dinosaur fossils have been discovered, people will again notice that the natural foundation of Hong Kong is quite spectacular.\u201d\n\nThe star attraction of the geopark has long been the hexagonal rock columns in Sai Kung, which were formed when a supervolcano erupted 140 million years ago.\n\nNg said that with the finding, \u201ca new story will emerge\u201d that will also put the sedimentary rock formations in other parts of the geopark under the spotlight.\n\n\u201cNew stories will create new excitement, especially for teenagers as they are particularly interested in dinosaurs. So we can use the fossils as an attraction to stimulate teenagers\u2019 interest in this aspect, which will drive interest in future learning,\u201d he said.\n\nNg added that the greater interest from students might also make geoscience research topics popular at universities, which could eventually lead to an increase in researchers and resources in the city\u2019s Earth science academia.\n\nThe fossils belonged to an undetermined kind of dinosaur that dated to the Cretaceous period about 145 million to 66 million years ago.\n\nPalaeontologist Fion Ma Wai-sum said that no animal could survive alone in the wild. She explained that the discovery suggested there was an ecosystem in the vicinity of the island during prehistoric times.\n\n\u201cIt definitely helps to provide a full picture of the dinosaurs living in South China in the past,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that it was plausible that experts would find even more fossils on the island, not only dinosaurs but other animals and plants.\n\nShe also expressed hopes that more resources would be allocated to relevant research, education and outreach activities due to the new discovery and the scientific significance of it.\n\nMichael Pittman, assistant professor at the school of life sciences at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said experts will compare the fossils found in the city with those from mainland China after conducting scientific research to determine the exact type of dinosaur.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that we can find out with further study,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the new finds lead to additional resources for the further expansion of paleontological studies in the city, that would be fantastic.\u201d\n\nChan Lung-sang, a visiting professor of the Department of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of California, Berkeley, said he doubted sufficient resources would ever be properly allocated to support geological studies in Hong Kong because geology was often considered as a marginal subject at schools.\n\n\u201cAlthough many students are passionate about topics like rocks, fossils and weather, they are frequently directed toward studying geography, which is primarily social studies ... The current school curriculum design, unfortunately, is not conducive to a proper earth science education in Hong Kong,\u201d he said.\n\nThe veteran geologist, who curated the new palaeontology gallery that opened last year at the Science Museum, also cautioned against attempts to commercially exploit scientific discovery.\n\n\u201cMy greatest concern is that fascinating discoveries, such as the dinosaur bone fossils, could end up being leveraged for economic initiatives, like promoting \u2018dinosaur bone tourism\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis could potentially lead to infrastructure development in our country parks, eventually resulting in irreversible changes to our natural heritage.\u201d\n\nMore from South China Morning Post:\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2024."

        "article_content": "Marie Curie discovered radioactivity, Alexander Fleming found penicillin: in the 20th century, their merit was clear when they received the Nobel Prizes. In 2024, the Physics and Chemistry Nobels are unusual, and show that the nature of discovery is changing with the advent of AI. How?\n\nOn the stage of Stockholm this year we could observe a new act of the power held by the tech giants of AI: it\u2019s a new performance that should keep us alert. It may be just a matter of doing new research with AI, but, together with their intention to fund a push for nuclear power to satisfy its needs of energy, we cannot sit down and applaud. We\u2019ve done that with social media and are seeing the consequence in our new generations.\n\nThe justification of the 2024 Physics Nobel Prize to J J Hopfield and G E Hinton was \u201cfor foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks\u201d, the forerunners of AI. The prize was perhaps not for physics, as some physicists have said. It was perhaps mimicry, since they copied the human brain\u2019s neural networks that neuroscientists took ages to discover and describe. They picked all that, transferred to the codes of computer science, then scaled up the number of educated artificial neural networks, inserting new layers to form complex networks: a quick job for AI. Evolution took much longer, but of course it came up with more interesting functions for human neurons.\n\nThe reason for the 2024 Nobel prize for Chemistry was \u201cFor computational protein design\u201d (D. Baker) and \u201cFor protein structure prediction\u201d (D Hassabis and J Jumper). Proteins are essential compounds for life, and their structure determines their functions. Part of their structural diversity is \u201cfolding\u201d, the way skeins of amino acid components fold over each other. Baker developed software to predict these structure, but eventually enlisted Hassabis and Jumper, two AI researchers at Deep Mind (Google) to boost this task. In the end, all 200 million proteins listed in prior genetic databases had their structure revealed.\n\nIn both those prizes, there are issues with originality and allocation of merit. In discovery, the winner usually comes up with original research. On the other hand, copying the structure of a living thing is called synthetic or artificial, hardly original. In the Physics prize case, the winners modified the known physical process a living neural network uses to consolidate memory. They used computer science and AI to come up with a machine process to do that.\n\nAs for the Chemistry prize, one could ask: whose merit is it if privileged access to software \u2014 backed by the extremely powerful, massive data of Deep Mind AI \u2014 allows all possible statistical experiments in little time? Displaced merit has a negative effect on innovation and effectiveness of research: this should be of concern to many, including governments\u2019 research funding agencies.\n\nOf further concern is the concentration of power in the hands of a few tech giants, whose alliances with our research establishments could skew, redirect research, benefit or leave behind some, according to the value algorithms that remain inaccessible.\n\nBut there are more fundamental problems with the use and intrusion of AI in research. One is the nature of AI: it is based on data of existing studies, experiments, trials and publications. There is nothing further, not even the so called \u2018generative\u2019 AI, which is based on new combinations of the same material in the form of large language models. Of course AI can generate anything, including \u2018hallucinations\u2019, but it cannot go further because it doesn\u2019t have logical processes, inferences and arguments, implications or assumptions, lateral thinking etc. So it\u2019s stuck with existing experiences, its creativity limited to novel combinations of the status quo.\n\nThe problem is the current status of AI: it\u2019s considered the most advanced tool one can use. So a creative human mind, instead of using imagination, original perception and new solutions, has to concentrate on the competing speed and cover of AI. Distracted in this way, human creativity will be stunted, preoccupied and loosing ground. When \u2018futurists\u2019 historians predict the takeover of machines over humans, they will have to refer to the slowing of the human mind, not to the advance of \u2018thinking\u2019 machines.\n\nThen, not least, there is the environment and the undoing of terrestrial climate. The AI industry is benefiting from the hype and the naivety of market investors: tech giants are growing at unprecedented speed and are using ever more quantities of energy. Now they are turning back to nuclear power with massive investments, including the idea of recommissioning Three Mile Island, the famous reactor involved in the 1979 nuclear accident. The renewed interest in nuclear power, especially the funds flowing to test the viability of small reactors, will no doubt work against the current speed of renewable energy development. The lively price of uranium is the latest proof."

It doesn't bring any new features.\n\nGoogle is also testing out a percentage indicator for transfer progress on mobile. The change is yet to roll out widely.\n\nSamsung and Google's merged Quick Share is a convenient file-sharing app. Available on Android, ChromeOS, and Windows, the app lets users transmit photos, videos, documents, audio files, and even entire folders through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct.\n\nFor mobile users, the application is set to gain support for file transmission over mobile data. Windows users, on the other hand, are receiving an update too, and although it isn't as exciting as mobile data support, it is necessary for the application's overall stability.\n\nThe update focuses solely on optimizing the application for Windows devices and squashing bugs that have long-plagued the app, bringing Quick Share to v1.0.2002.2 on Windows, as spotted by 9to5Google. A rundown of all the changes can be found below:\n\nFixed to delete files received from an unknown sender with the same payload ID.\n\nFixed an issue that caused the app to crash when a file name has non-ASCII characters.\n\nFixed an issue where non-ASCII characters prevented received files from opening successfully.\n\nFixed an issue when reading preferences.\n\nFixed an issue where preferences failed to save on certain system configurations.\n\nFixed an issue that kept the Quick Share shortcut icon from showing up in the Start menu after installation.\n\nFixed an issue that caused the app to crash when reading an input file.\n\nFixed an issue that caused multiple GATT reads during discovery.\n\nFixed a bug to stop Wi-Fi LAN advertising.\n\nFixed an issue that caused the app to crash when connecting to Bluetooth.\n\nFixed an issue that prevented the Wi-Fi hotspot profile from being deleted correctly.\n\nFixed an issue where the Wi-Fi hotspot couldnt be recovered when the app was closed during file transfer.\n\nGet ready for an improved mobile app UI as well\n\nThe update follows version 1.0.1939.4, which improved the app's animations, added car and foldable devices to the list of device types, alongside support for credential expiration. It's worth noting that the Quick Share app on the Microsoft Store is Samsung's iteration, and currently only works with Samsung devices. Google's unified version of the app for Windows devices is only available through its own website.\n\nIn other Quick Share-related news, Google seems to be testing out a UI tweak for the app on mobile that brings it closer to the desktop counterpart. For reference, Quick Share on Windows shows an estimate of the time remaining alongside the transfer speed during an active transfer. As part of a recent test, users on mobile have now started spotting a percentage-based progress bar, resulting in more precise transfer progress tracking. The change seems to be part of an A/B test, and hasn't rolled out widely yet."
