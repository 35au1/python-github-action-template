Fourth St.\n\nThese vehicles, which include things such as a replica of the 1960s Batmobile, a Delorean with a flux capacitor and even an \"invisible\" Boatmobile from the animated series \"Spongebob Squarepants,\" showcase a look at the most odd, weird and quirky things someone might see driving down the street.\n\n'Oddities' in Salina: A fun exhibition to curate\n\nMatthew Miller-Wells, the director of education for The Garage who worked on getting vehicles this exhibition, said it has been one of the more fun things to curate.\n\n\"There's just some weird, obscure stuff here,\" Miller-Wells said.\n\nIt's not only the 1995 \"ChewBaru,\" a Subaru Boxer covered with dental tools, dentures, toothbrushes and more, that excites Miller-Wells, but the rare vehicles that have gone out of style.\n\n\"The (K-Car) '83 LeBaron that's over there excites me just as much as like the (floating) Amphicar, because you just don't see those anymore,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to the words that have already been used to describe this show, like odd and weird, he said one word is going to stick with him as people visit.\n\n\"I think 'polarizing' could absolutely be one,\" he said. \"There are cars here that people will love to see and ones that people will be really confused and don't like.\n\n\"That's the fun of it, is that what is strange is subjective. Someone may think it makes no sense that a K-Car is in here, because they remember a time when they were everywhere.\"\n\nThe Garage, an automotive museum in downtown Salina, opened its latest exhibition this week: \"Oddities.\" The exhibition, which features such vehicles as the Batmobile, a UFO and an amphibious car, will be on display through the end of the year.\n\nWhen is 'Oddities' on display in Salina? How much is admission?\n\n\"Oddities\" is now open at The Garage for people to come and see.\n\nDaily general admission for the museum is $15, with discounts for seniors, students and military being $12.\n\nThe museum is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays.\n\nMemberships are also available beginning at $45 a year, with unlimited admission to the museum and other benefits included.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Salina Journal: Salina automobile museum's newest exhibit includes the weird and odd"

        "article_content": "Fans at Jane's Addiction's Boston concert were left scratching their heads after frontman Perry Farrelllaunched a physical attack on guitarist Dave Navarro. Some concertgoers, including photographer Brian MacKenzie, believe the shocking brawl may have been nothing more than a staged stunt.\n\nThe incident, which took place Friday night at the Leader Bank Pavilion, erupted during the band's performance of \"Ocean Size.\" Farrell, visibly agitated, started hurling expletives at the crowd before turning his fury on Navarro. According to a now-viral video, Farrell aggressively shoved Navarro, leading to a confrontation that spiraled out of control.\n\nBut as punches flew and Farrell was dragged offstage by crew members, fans were left divided on what they had just witnessed. MacKenzie, who was hired to snap photos of the show, shared his disbelief on social media.\n\n\"The crowd believed the whole thing was a bit,\" MacKenzie tweeted. \"Perry had a huge bottle of wine with him all evening, and Navarro and Avery seemed angrier than usual throughout the show.\"\n\nThe incident caused division among fans\n\nOther fans echoed MacKenzie's sentiments, with one attendee writing on X (formerly Twitter), \"Was it real or staged? We were all confused. It seemed like a setup, but then Perry was hauled off, and the show just ended.\"\n\nThe altercation came to a head when Farrell threw two elbow jabs at Navarro, who tried to hold him back calmly. Several bandmates, including bassist Eric Avery, and crew members rushed in to break up the scuffle as the lights dimmed on stage.\n\nDespite the chaotic scene, the remaining band members-Navarro, Avery, and drummer Stephen Perkins-came forward to wave goodbye to the crowd, raising their hands in a peace gesture as if to diffuse any lingering confusion.\n\nOne fan remarked, \"Half the crowd was pissed the show ended early, and the other half thought they'd just witnessed the last Jane's Addiction show ever.\"\n\nNeither Farrell nor Navarro has commented on the altercation, leaving the situation shrouded in mystery. The silence only adds fuel to the speculation that the whole brawl could have been a stunt to add drama to the band's reunion tour.\n\nIs this the end of Jane's Addiction?\n\nThis isn't the first time Jane's Addiction's performances have faced challenges. During a show at Pier 17 in NYC earlier this month, Farrell confessed to fans that his voice wasn't in top shape, saying, \"Something's wrong with my voice. I just can't get the notes out all of a sudden.\"\n\nDespite the vocal struggles and Friday's altercation, Jane's Addiction is scheduled to continue their North American tour with a performance at the Hartford Healthcare Amphitheater in Connecticut on Sept. 15. However, music fans are now left wondering if Friday's meltdown was just part of the act or a sign of deeper tensions within the band.\n\nWith so much uncertainty surrounding the band's future, one thing remains clear: the Boston crowd experienced a night they won't soon forget, staged or not."

        "article_content": "Disco Volante is a watch style. In Italian, it also means \u201cflying disc\u201d but neither Frisbee nor mid-argument dinner plates. It\u2019s simply a term for a UFO and harks back to the mid-20th century. With such a rich history of Italian people collecting watches, many terms and nicknames have an Italian origin, but is this design ethos a new and rising trend?\n\nJudging from the response to the seemingly lugless Furlan Marri Disco Volante in its three versions, we will see more, and I, for one, will rejoice. Like the odd Cartier Pebble with its massive resurgence, round or roundish watches with short or no lugs are comfortable daily wearers. They also offer a much-needed alternative to the plethora of diver\u2019s watches that abound and are sleek options if small rectangles do not convince you. Let\u2019s look at the Furlan Marri, a smooth alternative to it, as well as some strong pre-owned options.\n\nA different take on vintage, now with a bracelet\n\nI already covered the Furlan Marri inspiration for this story, now known as the Disco. Read my article on it here, and it will serve as an intro to a style that has gone fairly viral in #watchfam circles. Even if my forearm has a tattoo that reads \u201ccontrarian,\u201d I do get the hype because we need new retro styles to covet.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen \u201960s diver\u2019s watches and know the time-traveling style they bring. I get it, but I enjoy dressing smart and have never quite caught the rectangular-Cartier bug, so I hope this is a new trend. In its three versions (Verde, Havana, and Celeste), the Furlan Marri Disco has been improved with the addition of a chic mesh bracelet that only heightened my desire. Better still, the price has remained the same at CHF 2,500\n\nVintage UFO grails from AP\n\nThe Furlan Marri Disco has a soft, circular case that takes inspiration from the most well-known flying saucers. Audemars Piguet might be known mostly for the Royal Oak and its Offshore brethren today, but when it comes to vintage dress watches, the brand excels. Most Disco Volante-style watches come with spare, minimalist dials like the Tiffany-signed one above sold by Amsterdam Vintage Watch Co. It has a Genta-revised design from the \u201970s that AP made for many years. In fact, the one above is from the early 2000s. The elaborate oversized bezel with its concentric rings gives it a big presence, only underlined by the big added value of a Tiffany signature.\n\nThe AP Disco Volantes come in many references with wildly varying price points. But I should underline one important fact here. Though I mentioned that G\u00e9rald Genta revised the design, in fact, a German designer should get the credit for its creation. Gebhard Duve originally sketched the \u201cDiscovolante\u201d 5093 models in the 1950s, as Audemars Piguet writes on its excellent AP Chronicles. The lovely 5093 above is my favorite, recently sold by Tempus Orologi in Italy for an unknown sum. It boasts a patinated cream dial and an architectural hobnail bezel in 18K white gold. Do a quick search on Chrono24, and you\u2019ll find an exceedingly wide spread of prices, starting with this lovely manual-wind 1960s model at just less than \u20ac4,000 up to more than \u20ac30K.\n\nSports watches, JLCs, Omegas, and more\n\nYou will find a lot more if you do a general Disco Volante search. And you\u2019ll be able to get your hands on vintage UFO gems for less than \u20ac1,000. The trend took off (get it?) around 50 years ago, and the choices are vast. With this search on Chrono24, you\u2019ll find quirky alternatives, such as this Longines Admiral powered by the caliber 431. It rocks a big (for a Disco Volante) 42mm case with a broad, radially brushed bezel. It\u2019s very unusual and shows that some brands appropriated the style into a sportier context, which only adds spice.\n\nOmega also had a UFO affair with the De Ville dress line. And within my search, they routinely appear for less than \u20ac1,000, offering big value. Of other brands, you will even find some Jaeger-LeCoultre variants and a delightful brace of Vacheron Constantin references. They are usually of the mid-\u201950s variety with a strong hobnail bezel design and a 35mm yellow gold case. However, the important question that needs to be asked is whether the Furlan Marri is the first of many new Disco Volantes to come. I say yes, and another lugless watch offers proof.\n\nA triangular Disco Volante?\n\nLike the rest of the team, I have only just decompressed from three days of horological wonder at Geneva Watch Days. And between running way too fast for 28\u00b0 Celsius to catch a meeting, I met with Matteo Violet-Vianello. He\u2019s the charming designer behind the brand Anoma. Brad Homes covered the Anoma A1 for us back in May, and after getting it on my wrist, I was smitten. The first model may have sold out and gone viral for good reason, but is it a Disco?\n\nI would say \u201cyes\u201d as I\u2019m sure there are triangular-shaped UFOs in the underground bunkers of Area 51. The Anoma has all the qualities except a circular case. It has a minimal design with a dressy touch sans lugs and is remarkably smooth with pebble-soft charm. The first run is sold out, but stay tuned to Anoma for more. I believe \u00a31,300 is a fair price to enter the realm of flying objects.\n\nDo wrist-worn flying objects tempt you, Fratelli? I\u2019m certainly feeling them, and I will also add an image of the epitome of the term. No, it\u2019s is not a watch but, rather, the amazing Bertona Alfa Romeo Disco Volante from 1952. Feel free to comment on the watches and the trend (and even the car) in the comments."

During his first marriage, to Jennifer Leigh Youngblood, the former Nirvana drummer confessed to cheating, an admission that ultimately led to their divorce.\n\nFoo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl stunned the world when he admitted to having an affair and fathering a child \"outside\" his marriage.

Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nGrohl shared the bombshell news in a statement posted to his Instagram account. Instagram/Dave Grohl\n\nHowever, the rocker's use of the word \"we\" in his statement seems to suggest he has hope that his second marriage will survive this scandal. Grohl also asked for the public's \"consideration\" as he and his loved one try to navigate the bombshell behind closed doors.\n\nPerhaps thankfully for Grohl, he has plenty of properties in which to seek refuge over the coming weeks, having amassed an impressive portfolio of real estate, much of which is located in California.\n\nSherman Oaks, CA\n\nThe self-proclaimed \"Valley Girl\" just sold a longtime Sherman Oaks, CA, home for a sweet profit. The musician picked up the four-bedroom residence in the San Fernando Valley in 2001 for $569,000.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nGrohl let go of what was billed as an \"incredible development opportunity in prime Sherman Oaks\" for $1.6 million in June.\n\n\"We\u2019re extremely excited to see this house get reimagined and back on the market in months,\" the listing agent Tim Gavin posted on Instagram in announcing the deal.\n\nEncino, CA\n\nGrohl has put down major roots in the oft-derided Valley.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"I love living in the Valley. My wife was born and raised in the Valley,\" he told the Los Angeles Daily News in 2013.\n\nGrohl picked up another longtime piece of real estate in 2003, the same year he married Blum. He paid $2.2 million for the Encino, CA, abode, which is his primary residence.\n\nBuilt in 1950, the 8,342-square-foot mansion offers five bedrooms. The one-story property sits on a 2-acre parcel, which includes a pool and a three-car garage.\n\nThe property is estimated to be worth around $6.8 million, according to Realtor.com\u00ae.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThis Encino, CA, property is Grohl's primary residence. Google Maps\n\nStudio 606 in Northridge, CA\n\nChoosing to stay close to home, the Foo Fighters founder grabbed a bare-bones warehouse in Northridge, CA, for $1,165,000 in June 2004 and transformed it into a recording studio.\n\n\"We were looking for a place to have a studio and also to have storage, and also to rehearse, and basically like a headquarters,\" Grohl said on a tour of the space. \"We found this one. It was just concrete walls and floors.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nBut now it's a state-of-the-art rocker nirvana.\n\nThere's a control room and guitar storage\u2014and for Foo fans, it's the studio where they recorded the albums \"In Your Honor\" and \"Echoes Silence Patience and Grace.\"\n\nOther bands have also used the studio to record, from Motorhead to Alice In Chains, along with other superstars such as Alice Cooper.\n\nGrohl bought a warehouse and turned it into an incredible recording studio. Google Maps\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nParanormal activity in Encino mansion\n\nGrohl hasn't used his own home as a recording space, but his band recorded its 10th album at a different mansion in Encino.\n\nHowever, things got spooky and certain events led the band to believe the house was haunted. Cue scary music!\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"When we walked into the house in Encino, I knew the vibes were definitely off,\" Grohl told NME in 2020.\n\n\"We started working there, and it wasn\u2019t long before things started happening,\" he said. \"We would come back to the studio the next day, and all of the guitars would be detuned.\"\n\nMORE FROM REALTOR:\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAlthough the band set up cameras to try to capture any paranormal phenomena, members stayed mum, signing nondisclosure agreements because the landlord was \"trying to sell the place,\" Grohl said. \"So, I can\u2019t give away what happened there in the past, but these multiple occurrences over a short period of time made us finish the album as quickly as we could.\u201d\n\nThe 4,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, Spanish-style abode, which dates to 1936, was eventually sold, spirits and all, in 2021 for $4.3 million.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Foo Fighters recorded their 10th album at this spooky Encino, CA, home. Realtor.com\n\nHere's a room set up as a recording studio. Realtor.com\n\nBeach bliss\n\nIt isn't all work: The singer and guitarist also owned a beach house in Oxnard, CA, a coastal city west of L.A.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nHe appears to have purchased this getaway in 2006, as a brand-new build for $3.7 million. It was sold at a loss for $2.9 million in 2015.\n\nOffering ocean and coastal views, the \"casually elegant\" four-bedroom pad sits right on Mandalay Beach. It features an open floor plan, a state-of-the-art kitchen, and high beamed ceilings.\n\nThe garage fits four cars, and the second floor features a primary suite complete with a fireplace and a balcony. Right off the dining room is an entertainment center.\n\nThe Oxnard, CA, beach house that was sold in 2015. Realtor.com\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nMore spooky behavior in Seattle, WA\n\nPrior to life in L.A., the Nirvana drummer lived in a '90s-era home in Shoreline, WA. He purchased the five-bedroom dwelling, set at the end of a cul-de-sac, for $335,000 in 1993.\n\nSpanning almost 4,000 square feet, the multilevel home built in 1991 includes a living room, family room, rec room, second kitchen, five decks, three fireplaces, and plentiful storage. However, during the rocker's ownership, he claimed the home had another feature: It was haunted.\n\n\u201cI moved into a house in Seattle in 1993,\" he told NME. \"It was a new house built at the edge of a forest, and little things started happening: noises, motion detectors going off. That soon ramped up into doors opening on their own, or I\u2019d feel like someone was right behind me at all times.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe odd activities were not enough to drive him out.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad that I wanted to move though,\" Grohl admitted. \"I just sort of stayed there and felt creeped out for two and a half years.\u201d In 1997, he sold the place for $345,000.\n\nSerene or spooky? Grohl claims the Seattle home was haunted. Realtor.com\n\nWhen Nirvana made it big in the early 1990s, Grohl said he bought a beach house in North Carolina.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nWhile there, he became a barbecue aficionado.\n\n\u201cWhen Nirvana became popular, the first thing I did is I bought a beach house in North Carolina and spent years up there, and I just ate pulled pork like f---ing crazy from the time I was 22 to about 25 years old,\u201d Grohl told Variety.\n\nRockin' residence in Virginia\n\nAfter the death of founder Kurt Cobain, Nirvana broke up and Grohl began to form the Foo Fighters. Tired of the L.A. scene, he briefly moved back to the area where he grew up, picking up a 1970s-era split-level home in Alexandria, VA.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAlthough he sold it long ago, and the four-bedroom, 4,500-square-foot residence has since been completely redone. But the residence remains a part of rock history, as the basement is where the Foo Fighters recorded their first Grammy-winning album, \u201cNothing Left to Lose.\u201d The album cover was even shot on the front deck, according to Annapolis Magazine.\n\n\"When we won for best rock album, which we made in that basement, I was so proud\u2014because we made it in my basement in a crappy makeshift studio that we put together ourselves,\" Grohl told the magazine.\n\n\"I stood there looking out at everybody in tuxedos and diamonds and fur coats, and I thought we were probably the only band that won a Grammy for an album made for free in a basement that year,\" he said.\n\nGrohl's Alexandria, VA, home, where the Foo Fighters recorded their Grammy-winning album \"Nothing Left to Lose.\" Google Maps\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nChildhood home in Springfield, VA\n\nGrohl grew up in Springfield, VA, living with his mother in a single-story, three-bed, two-bath, 2,000-square-foot home. The cozy abode was purchased in 1975 for $49,000. Built in 1958, the brick house includes a fireplace and sits on a third of an acre.\n\nWhen he was 7, his parents divorced, and he and his sister, Lisa, were largely raised by their mother, Virginia Grohl. At age 12, he picked up the guitar, later switching to drums.\n\nGrohl attended multiple local high schools, eventually dropping out at the age of 17 to join the Washington, DC, punk-rock band Scream as drummer.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWhenever I felt overwhelmed with the success of Nirvana,\u201d Dave told the Washingtonian, \u201cI would just go back to Virginia, to that house, to the bedroom where I grew up and the neighborhood that I walked through to school every day and all of my friends were two or three blocks away, and it helped me keep my head level.\u201d\n\nAlthough he apparently considered buying a new house for his mom in the 1990s, the two decided against it, choosing to preserve the memories of his early love of music.\n\nHis mom split her time between his childhood home and L.A., before passing away in 2022."

        "article_content": "Six Flags Fright Fest at Magic Mountain \u201cgoes to 11\u201d to borrow and twist a line from the great Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap fame.\n\nSix Flags Magic Mountain hosted the media and VIPs on Friday, Sept. 14 for Fright Fest Extreme that runs at the Valencia amusement park on select nights through Nov. 3.\n\nSign up for our Park Life newsletter and find out what\u2019s new and interesting every week at Southern California\u2019s theme parks. Subscribe here\n\nALSO SEE: Will Leatherface terrorize Knott\u2019s, Six Flags or Universal in 2025?\n\nMagic Mountain is going for quantity over quality this year in hopes of catching up to and eventually overtaking Universal\u2019s Horror Nights and Knott\u2019s Scary Farm.\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious and audacious goal that Six Flags achieves this year on one front: The Fright Fest \u201cmore, more, more\u201d approach outdoes Horror Nights and Scary Farm in sheer volume.\n\nMagic Mountain\u2019s Fright Fest has more haunted mazes (11) and more scare zones (9) than either of its rivals.\n\n\u201cMore, more, more\u201d is the right approach when you are trailing badly and need to catch up to the perennial gold and silver medalists. It\u2019s also painful, tiring, slow and ugly at times and even seemingly fruitless.\n\nBut the sheer effort and boldness of the necessary endeavor is an important part of the process.\n\nALSO SEE: How Slash makes scary soundtracks for Universal Horror Nights mazes\n\nFright Fest Extreme proves it is worthy of being in the same ring as Knott\u2019s and Universal this year \u2014 even if the results aren\u2019t always pretty. The message: Magic Mountain is in the game to stay and it isn\u2019t going away quietly into the foggy night.\n\nThe 1984 \u201cThis is Spinal Tap\u201d mockumentary movie was famously filmed at Magic Mountain with the band performing as the second billing to a puppet show at a sparsely attended concert at a fictional theme park. The scene was filmed in Magic Mountain\u2019s Showcase Theater \u2014 the precursor to the Golden Bear that is in the process of being demolished.\n\nALSO SEE: Everything you can eat and drink at Knott\u2019s Scary Farm \u2014 See the list\n\nFright Fest certainly turns things up to 11 this year at Magic Mountain.\n\nStep one in any comeback journey is to tear down the past. Magic Mountain is taking a wrecking ball to its reputation as the perennial bronze medalist in the annual Southern California Halloween showdown \u2014 just like it did to the Golden Bear Theater.\n\nFright Fest is going after longtime champ Horror Nights and tearing a page from its playbook with a handful of haunted mazes based on Hollywood horror film franchises.\n\nLet\u2019s look inside each of 11 Fright Fest mazes and rank them from best to worst.\n\n1) Saw 20th Anniversary\n\nThe Saw film franchise movies follow the bloody trail of the Jigsaw serial killer who sets physical and psychological torture traps for his victims that he calls tests or games.\n\nMagic Mountain needs to look to this year\u2019s Saw maze if it wants to find the path forward in its bloody battle with Horror Nights and Scary Farm.\n\nThe Saw maze does everything right \u2014 from set design and storytelling to characters and scares.\n\nThe triggered scares where a \u201cscareactor\u201d hits a button to set off sound and lighting effects before popping out of a hiding place were executed perfectly \u2014 something sorely lacking in other mazes throughout the night.\n\nThere are a lot of long, dark and empty hallways in this year\u2019s Fright Fest \u2014 but none as good as the one in the Saw maze that hits you with plumes of fog from above and blasts of air at your ankles.\n\nThe torture traps don\u2019t show up until the second half of the maze \u2013 but they are worth the wait. Expertly designed and perfectly executed, you will want to help these poor souls escape their excruciatingly painful fate \u2013 and get out of there as fast as you can to avoid the same plight.\n\n2) Conjuring Universe\n\nThe Conjuring film franchise dramatizes the exploits of real-life paranormal investigators and creates origin stories for the spirits they encounter.\n\nLast year, Magic Mountain dipped its toe into the water of intellectual property horror mazes with a Conjuring maze that felt one-third finished.\n\nThis year, the Conjuring maze feels two-thirds finished. Maybe next year it will be complete and ready for prime time.\n\nThe good news: This year\u2019s maze is twice as good as last year\u2019s version.\n\nThe scareactors help bring the Conjuring stories to life. The priest splashing holy water on passing visitors is great. The picture frame with a pair of hands coming out of the wall to reveal the monster behind the painting goes down as one of the best \u2014 and simplest \u2014 effects of the night.\n\nA zoetrope scene creates a mesmerizing visual illusion that reinforces the storytelling and adds action without the need for a scare.\n\nOne big ding: The exterior does nothing to sell what\u2019s inside the maze. Nailing a vinyl \u201cConjuring\u201d sign up on the building facade is lazy \u2014 and won\u2019t move Fright Fest ahead of Horror Nights or Scary Farm.\n\n3) Stranger Things\n\nThe Netflix show about supernatural forces and secret government experiments follows a group of 1980s kids as they try to get to the bottom of what\u2019s happening in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.\n\nI came in with high hopes for the Stranger Things maze and needed to return a second time to fulfill those great expectations.\n\nAs with many of the mazes throughout the night, the scareactors were sparse to nonexistent the first time around. At times, Fright Fest mazes appeared to simply shut down for 15 minutes so the spread-thin talent could take a break.\n\nThe good news is the scareactors in the Fright Fest mazes and scare zones are simply fantastic. And that is especially true in the Stranger Things maze.\n\nWithout the scareactors, a maze can feel like walking through a museum. With them, the scenes come alive.\n\nThe storytelling is the draw with familiar franchises like Stranger Things. You want to see the familiar faces from the show. Fortunately for me, that happened the second time around.\n\nThe biggest takeaway: Magic Mountain needs to tighten up the spacing in the Stranger Things maze. The rooms are too big and need to feel more intimate and confining with no place to run.\n\n4) Trick r\u2019 Treat\n\nThe 2007 \u201cTrick \u2018r Treat\u201d film follows a series of interconnected storylines with a demonic trick-or-treater named Sam tying the tales together.\n\nThe Trick r\u2019 Treat maze hits a lot of the storytelling points from the movie \u2014 if you\u2019ve watched the horror flick recently about a small town that faces real ghosts and goblins on Halloween night.\n\nThe focus is on storytelling rather than set decor in the Trick r\u2019 Treat maze There\u2019s a ton of blackout walls and long hallways where you wonder where you\u2019re going and what\u2019s around the corner.\n\nFright Fest tends to get better over time. This maze has incredible potential. Once again, it\u2019s a simple story that\u2019s easy to quickly understand.\n\nTrick r\u2019 Treat offers a great base to expand upon. Magic Mountain can add to this maze each year and build it out over time.\n\nThe story is generic enough to work for people unfamiliar with the movie, but can also go much deeper for fans of \u201cTrick r\u2019 Treat.\u201d\n\n5) Condemned: Forever Damned\n\nThe walls of a dilapidated home come alive with the spirits who once lived in this haunted house, taken over in past years by a Spring Break frat party.\n\nYou know what you\u2019re getting with a condemned haunted house and it\u2019s an easy story to tell \u2014 even without the backstory of a major horror franchise. The set dressing is solid throughout and works from year to year with slight storytelling tweaks.\n\nThe frat party is finally over, but there are still a few reminders of the kegger-gone-mad lingering in the halls.\n\nThe vibe in the Condemned house is utterly fantastic. It\u2019s less about jump scares and more about in-your-face moments of way-too-close uncomfortableness.\n\nThe scareactors all look slightly deranged with wild Cheshire Cat grins on their faces as if the frat bros decided to swap a Coors Light keg for a tank of laughing gas.\n\nThe Condemned: Forever Damned maze gets the award for the best talent of the night. Which also helps make it this year\u2019s best non-IP maze.\n\n6) Sewer of Souls\n\nStep into an oozing underground world of terrifying tunnels filled with lost souls amid the dank air and the smell of dread in this disgusting trip through city sewers.\n\nYuck is the best word to describe the Sewer of Souls maze. Here\u2019s another simple concept that\u2019s easy to convey and visualize. The only thing missing is the smell.\n\nI love the toilet plungers dripping with sewage that hang from the ceiling like putrid light fixtures.\n\nThe best effect: The inflatable walls squeezing in from both sides that feel like you are descending deeper and deeper into sewer water. A blast of smell here could help sell the illusion and make it even more memorable.\n\n7) Truth or Dare\n\nStep inside a haunted studio for a warped version of the \u201cTruth or Dare\u201d TV game show.\n\nTruth of Dare is both the worst maze from a set dressing perspective and the best maze in terms of scares.\n\nI jumped out of my skin a half dozen times as I walked through endless hallways of painted plywood walls. Nobody was taking a break in Truth of Dare. The scareactors get an A for effort in this one.\n\nAnother inflatable wall gag is played to great effect in the Truth or Dare maze with the bug-filled pillows of air seemingly going on forever.\n\n8) Army of the Dead\n\nThe Army of the Dead maze based on the 2021 Netflix film remake visits Las Vegas during a viral outbreak lockdown as survivors battle the undead.\n\nThis new intellectual property maze takes over half of the Aftermath outdoor maze that has always been a highlight of past Fright Fests.\n\nThis one leans heavily on jump scares but lacks the triggered sound and lighting effects necessary to pay it off.\n\nThere is some backstory here centered on a Las Vegas zombie apocalypse, but the lack of scareactors once again does in this maze. A lot of gray walls \u2014 a recurring theme of this year\u2019s Fright Fest \u2014 didn\u2019t help propel any attempts at storytelling.\n\nYou\u2019re left thinking: Six Flags paid money for this? It feels like they stuck the Army of the Dead on top of Aftermath and tacked on a little bit of indoor maze at the end.\n\nFright Fest needs to do better than this to compete with Knott\u2019s and Universal. The natural next step is to trim back on the number of mazes and scare zones and focus on quality.\n\n9) Willoughby\u2019s Resurrected\n\nThe reincarnated Willoughby family roams the harrowing hallways of their beloved mansion in this classic Magic Mountain haunted house.\n\nWilloughby\u2019s is always one of my favorite Fright Fest mazes with terrific set dressing. This year fell flat in large part due to a lack of talent.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is Magic Mountain needs to hire more scareactors if it\u2019s going to build more mazes and add more scare zones. If you take a \u201cmore, more, more\u201d approach that needs to extend to hiring as well.\n\nFright Fest feels like it\u2019s staffed at about one-third to half the level it needs to be. That\u2019s unlikely to change this year, but it sure needs to if Magic Mountain wants to compete with the titans of terror.\n\nThe Willoughby family is working hard without much support. Two or three times the number of reincarnated family members would help bring the place to life.\n\nWithout the talent, Willoughby\u2019s mansion just looks and feels old and tired.\n\n10) Vault 666 Unlocked\n\nDemonic relics cast spells on a dark and sinister antique shop and haunt those who try to steal the artifacts in this past-its-expiration-date Fright Fest maze.\n\nSpeaking of old and tired, the demon\u2019s lair needs to be retired and reimagined as something new. It\u2019s played out and has seen better days.\n\nThere are plenty of the potential \u201cone of these things is not like the other\u201d scares that don\u2019t get paid off in the way you expect. Instead of one of the dozen mannequins coming to life, it\u2019s just another jump scare coming out of a curtain.\n\n11) Aftermath: Nocturnal Hunt\n\nThe fog-shrouded post-apocalyptic city filled with life-size props, pyrotechnics and other special effects has been cut in half from past years to make room for the new Army of the Dead maze.\n\nThe Aftermath maze feels like the Afterthought maze this year as the Army of the Dead ends up with the better half of the outdoor maze.\n\nThis seems like Magic Mountain needed one more maze to \u201cgo to 11\u201d like Spinal Tap and decided to tack this one on just for the sheer sake of volume."

        "article_content": "Sunday marks the start of Hispanic Heritage Month, a celebration honoring the contributions and histories of Americans with roots in countries including Mexico, Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nThe observance spans two months honoring a long-established community whose influence is felt throughout the country.\n\n\u201cIt celebrates a vast community of Americans who have made invaluable contributions to the United States for over 300 years,\u201d the executive director of the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico Margie Huerta said. \u201cHispanic and Latinx people are making important contributions to American arts, culture and humanities, and all aspects of society, every single day.\u201d\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nWho started Hispanic Heritage Month?\n\nFrom newly arrived immigrants to native communities that have called these lands home for centuries, the community has gained considerable cultural and political clout since the occasion began in 1968 as a weeklong commemoration under President Lyndon Johnson. The legislation was sponsored by California Rep. Edward Roybal of Los Angeles, an Albuquerque native whose family moved to California when he was 6.\n\nIn 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law a bill sponsored by Illinois Sen. Paul Simon expanding National Hispanic Heritage Week to 30 days. Reagan used the moment to praise Hispanics and their cultural pillars of church and school, but most of all to extol the virtues of \"familia.\"\n\n\u201cAs the great poet Octavio Paz has said: \u2018In Hispanic morals, the true protagonist is the family,\u2019\u201d Reagan said in his address. \"I fear that too often, in the mad rush of modern American life, some people have not learned the great lesson of our Hispanic heritage: the lesson of family and home and church and community.\u201d\n\nWhen is Hispanic Heritage Month?\n\nHispanic Heritage Month is between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15.\n\nThe month\u2019s starting date is significant because it\u2019s the independence day for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Mexico, Chile and Belize mark their celebrations on Sept. 16, Sept. 18 and Sept. 21, respectively.\n\nStarting in the middle of the month also encompasses, on the celebration\u2019s latter end, Oct. 12. Known as Columbus Day in the United States, the day is referred to in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries as Di\u0301a de la Raza, honoring the countries and peoples conquered by Spain and other European nations.\n\nHow is Hispanic Heritage Month celebrated?\n\nGabriela Baeza Ventura, a professor of Spanish at the University of Houston, previously told USA TODAY that Hispanic Heritage Month pays respect to a population with deep roots in the United States and a wide range of ancestral origins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful and important opportunity for the general public to visualize the contributions and presence of a community that has been in this territory since before the U.S. was formed as a nation,\u201d Ventura said. \u201cIt\u2019s a community that encompasses so many different nations, so many registers of Spanish and so many experiences.\u201d\n\nThough many celebrations revolve around fiestas, Mexican or Latin American food and popular images of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Day of the Dead, Ventura said it\u2019s time to commemorate other notable figures, both historical and those in our midst.\n\nShe cited Jovida Idar, an early 20th-century Mexican American journalist and activist from Laredo, Texas, whose image will be minted as part of the American Women Quarters Program, as well as Colombia-born Lina Hidalgo, who at age 27 became the first woman \u2013 and first Latina \u2013 elected as county judge in Texas\u2019 Harris County in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing other characters come to life,\u201d Ventura said."

        "article_content": "There is a massive transformation happening in the financial services industry due to technological advancements and evolving consumer expectations. Key to this transformation has been advances in financial software development as companies innovate, improve operational efficiencies and create better customer experiences. In response to these trends, an article has been developed to take a deep dive into the major breakthroughs defining financial software development and unearthing more upon highlights on how developments in this niche affects global industries.\n\nThe Rise of Fintech Solutions\n\nWith a machine-like version of human oversight, the financial services industry has been transformed by disruptive fintech (financial technology). Fintech companies are using very advanced tech-enabled tools to change the way banking and financial services work, with innovative products that meet consumer needs today.\n\nMobile Banking and Payments\n\nConsumers and businesses of all sizes can benefit, as mobile banking & payment solutions have changed the way people interact with financial services. Users can manage and control their finances, make payments & transfers if they need be and access traditional banking services on their cellphones via these applications.\n\nLately we\u2019re seeing all our favorite payment apps such as Venmo, PayPal and Cash App explode in popularity. Similarly, traditional banks have also gone mobile with apps like Chase Mobile or Bank of America Mobile Banking.\n\nDigital Wallets\n\nDigital wallets are one more sort of fintech that has in a lot of ways changed the economic landscape. They are secure wallets that store payment details and allow you to pay for stuff without cash or using your pocket card with a simple tap.\n\nOther than the fact they work, Apple Pay and Google Wallet are pretty pedestrian \u2013 just another digital wallet to use side-by-side with traditional payment methods.\n\n1) AI and ML\n\nIn financial app development, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are acting as a spine. Initiatives are using these technologies to improve everything from customer service in financial services and insurtech, through to risk management.\n\nCustomer-Centric Engagement. Financial institutions can now capitalize on AI and ML to provide customers with bespoke experiences, by utilizing an abundance of data reservoirs that the solution solutions analyze, in order to understand individual liking or dislike patterns. This customization makes for happier and returning customers.\n\nArtificial Intelligence-Powered Chatbots for Instant Customer Support and Product Recommendations Credit unions, along with traditional banks and fintech companies deploy chatbots powered by AI to provide instant customer support and query responses; leverage data analytics capabilities using the user\u2019s financial history or behavioral analysis laying down personalized product recommendations.\n\nFraud Detection and Risk Management. Vendors are employing AI and ML for better fraud prevention and risk management as well. Real-time transaction pattern analysis- These technologies monitor transactions as they occur and detect any anomalies indicative of fraudulent activities.\n\nBy using machine learning algorithms, credit card companies better recognize unusual purchasing behavior and high probability fraud which could help to prevent unwanted transactions protecting the general public.\n\n2) Blockchain and Cryptocurrency\n\nIn financial software development, both blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have paved the way for new trends. This will bring novel options in transaction execution, value storage and financial operation security/ transparency.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) is a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges or banks. DeFi platforms allow for users to lend, borrow, trade and invest in a decentralized fashion.\n\nAs a result, platforms like Uniswap, Compound and Aave have gained popularity allowing users to perform financial activities without need for traditional middlemen. Using smart contracts for securing and executing transactions across various platforms.\n\nCryptocurrencies and Digital Assets\n\nCryptocurrencies and digital assets are going more mainstream every year as they get increasingly adopted by financial institutions (now including PayPal), consumers, and even institutional investors. More recently, fintech development concentrates on building products with cryptocurrency support and secure storage to help things like crypto transactions.\n\nThere are many excellent places where you can buy and sell bitcoin, but Coinbase or Binance offer a fast way to get started compared to other options. Families of traditional financial institutions are also checking out the water in a splash, matured enough over blockchain technology space to innovate their workflow and onboard new products.\n\n3) Cloud computing\n\nCloud computing and API integration are the key trends driving modern software for financial services. They help financial institutions to streamline their operations, as well as secure and provide services with the latest technologies.\n\nFinancial companies can greatly benefit from cloud computing, since with the help of easily deployable and scalable hybrid, public or private cloud applications their business will be more competitive. Cloud-based solutions also mean easy to update and maintain, so that financial software solutions always remain secure and current.\n\nOne trend that we are witnessing is banks & financial institutions moving their core banking systems to the cloud and accessing services such as AWS, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure for bolstering IT infrastructure of these enterprises.\n\n4) API Integration\n\nAn API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of accessible requests that all software systems can use to communicate and work together. Among other use cases in financial services, APIs facilitate the integration of different applications and enable access to external third-party solutions or features.\n\nThe API for open banking allows third party developers to create applications and services around the financial institution. This enables innovation and greater consumer choice, leading to more competition in financial products.\n\nConclusion\n\nFinancial software development landscape emerging rapidly, the financial development environment is being elastically conformed over several innovations in fintech, advancements of AI and ML technology blocks like blockchain tech notably also driving adoption side-by-side with cloud technologies empowering these API-first approaches. Technologies needed to realize these trends are changing the dynamics of financial services making room for new businesses and experiences. After all, financial institutions that side with these trends will be able to compete effectively and keep pace with evolving consumer expectations in the new digital era. With the industry continuously changing, businesses that stay agile with these trends will perform better on this fast-paced financial landscape."

        "article_content": "Last week, I was in Berlin with the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold at the very start of my review period, and I wanted to write something about the camera ahead of it. I decided to do so by indulging in a photographic hobby of mine.\n\nWhen I travel, I like to take photos of cars, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was going to be my companion. It had better be up to the task, as other phones were waiting in the wings if it let me down.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nCar-spotting in Berlin\n\nDespite the Pixel 9 Pro Fold having Pro in its name, it does not have the same camera as the Pixel 9 Pro or even the Pixel 9. It has a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5MP wide-angle camera, and a 10.8MP telephoto camera for a 5x optical zoom. It\u2019s essentially the same as the Google Pixel Fold\u2019s camera setup, and on a technical level, it\u2019s not as impressive as the far less expensive (but much less foldy) Pixel 9 Pro or even the Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nBut would it do what I wanted while in Berlin? I was in the city for the IFA 2024 technology trade show, and I stayed in close proximity to Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (or Ku\u2019damm for short), which is central, elegant, and packed with lovely places for coffee and food. It\u2019s also full of expensive designer stores, luxury watch brand boutiques, and all the cars accompanying those who shop there. Over the many years I\u2019ve stayed in this area, I\u2019ve always enjoyed some casual car-spotting, often to the chagrin of my colleagues.\n\nI\u2019m a car geek, so when I\u2019m in new places, I find it really enjoyable to spot cars I don\u2019t usually see at home. What makes Kurf\u00fcrstendamm enjoyable for me is the variety of cars you see cruising and parked up, ranging from supercars to modern classics in fantastic condition.\n\nA good car-spotting camera needs to take colorful, high-contrast, dynamic photos in all lighting conditions to highlight the metal. It really needs a telephoto camera, so you don\u2019t have to get right up close to the vehicle when taking a photo, keeping things more incognito. It also needs a robust editing suite and a big screen to make adjustments. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold should be a great choice, so how did it do?\n\nUsing the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera\n\nOver the few days I was in Berlin, I took around 50 photos of different cars with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold \u2014 and I loved the results, regardless of whether I used the main, wide, 5x telephoto camera, or even the 2x non-optical zoom. I was consistently impressed with the speed of the camera, too, and although I didn\u2019t take many photos of cars on the move (more on that in a moment), I never missed a shot due to the camera or app being too slow.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I take photos of cars on the move? I had intended to try out Google\u2019s Action Pan mode, which adds a cool motion blur effect to moving objects, as I\u2019d enjoyed it on the Pixel 9 and Pixel 8. However, oddly, Action Pan is missing from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera app. Action Pan\u2019s sister mode, Long Exposure, is present though. There\u2019s no obvious technical reason why it\u2019s not included, and in this case, it was rather frustrating. Perhaps it\u2019ll turn up in a future software update.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 4 Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster. 5x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes Maybach S680. 5x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-AMG GT. Main camera Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz AMG G63. Wide-angle Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nWhat about the cars? It\u2019ll come as no surprise that two leading car brands dominate the Ku\u2019damm landscape: Mercedes Benz and Porsche. Porsches of all types are so prevalent that I stopped taking photos of 911s, as I\u2019d have spent most of my time capturing them if I hadn\u2019t done so.\n\nI didn\u2019t do the same with Mercedes as, despite seeing so many, the models were often highly unusual spots for me, as Ku\u2019dammers seem to love their high-performance Mercs. That said, on one day, the first five cars I considered photographing were all AMG GT models of various types, giving you an idea of how prevalent this particular car was in the area.\n\nThe cars and photos\n\nI didn\u2019t want to fixate on just supercars either, and I wanted to illustrate the variety of cars I saw, which I think speaks to the interesting car culture that I assume exists in Berlin and its surroundings. The convertible Mustang was a surprise, and although I didn\u2019t get photos as most were on the move when I saw them, the amount of Aston Martin and Jaguars, both new and old, illustrated that it wasn\u2019t solely about German cars either. Ferrari was notable in its absence, and the few I did see were easily outnumbered by Lamborghini and Bentley models. It was fantastic to see all these cars out and in use, particularly during the week.\n\nThe beautiful weather during my stay no doubt helped people bring out cars that may have otherwise been safely garaged, and it also helped out with my photos, as did the urban backdrop. I tried to incorporate Ku\u2019damm and its side streets into the photos, but there were times when a bit too much of it got in the way, and this is where the Pixel 9 Pro Fold became the ultimate companion for my car-spotting adventures on the move. For a start, opening the phone to view and then edit images on the large screen is amazing, and it simply can\u2019t be matched on a non-folding phone. Only editing on a laptop or tablet can compare, and I can carry neither in my pocket.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 6 1967 Ford Mustang Convertible.

Main camera Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz S Class. 2x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nOn the open screen I was able to make full use of Google Photos\u2019 Magic Editor mode, and wow, did it do some impressive things. My favorite is the wide-angle photo of the Mustang, which was interrupted by a street sign and some of the rental scooters that litter Berlin\u2019s streets when I took it.\n\nAmazingly, after a few careful swipes, Magic Editor took them all away without a trace. If I didn\u2019t point it out and show you the before image, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever realize. It also turned a photo I\u2019d have probably discarded into one I really like. I did the same with the background in the photo of the beautiful R129 SL, then removed the parked cars on either side of the white S Class, and was astonished by the clean, seamless result.\n\nNot a car-spotter?\n\nThis isn\u2019t our review of the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold or its camera, so all the photos you see here have been edited on the device using the tools found in Google Photos. Magic Editor has become incredibly adept at removing small distractions and re-creating backgrounds perfectly, and cleaning up the photos took just a few moments.\n\nBut I only wanted to edit the photos because they looked excellent to begin with, meaning I could tweak them to my taste rather than use the tools to try to reach an acceptable baseline. I\u2019ve managed to create a collection of photos I am really happy with that captures Berlin\u2019s obvious love of very powerful cars.\n\nWhen I came up with the idea of using car-spotting as the basis for my story on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold while in Berlin, it was with some trepidation. I take these photos for myself and fun, so I didn\u2019t want that to change. If the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was a pain or didn\u2019t take the pictures I wanted, it would become an effort and effectively become work, with all the fun of car photography removed.\n\nThis didn\u2019t happen because the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a joy to hold and use. It\u2019s not annoyingly heavy, the software has been faultless, and I never wanted to reach for the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max I also had with me to take a photo. I enjoyed my occasional hobby of photographing cool cars I spot just as much, if not more than usual, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold as my camera and Magic Editor at the ready.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never taken a photo of a car and are wondering if all this is relevant to you, all the same principles and performance of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera and Google Photos apply to whatever you\u2019re photographing. I love the open screen when I want to see my photos after taking them, and the telephoto camera allows me to shoot my chosen subject in more visually exciting ways from a distance. The editing toolkit helped me easily create photos I wish had been possible in real life.\n\nRegardless of what you want to take photos of, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a great companion. My first few days with the phone and its camera have left me smitten, and it\u2019s looking like the start of a very positive review."
