There were stories that shaped our community, stories that kept your family safe, and stories that simply made us smile.\n\nHere are some of the stories on 2024 that reminded us of all the good out there.\n\nJCPS bus driver going viral after he bought PJs for 1st grader who didn't have any for Pajama Day\n\nA Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) bus driver went the extra mile for a first grader. It was Pajama Day at school but 6-year-old Levi didn't have any PJs.\n\n\"As he saw that I was upset, he saw my head looking down, and when I got on the bus he asked me what was wrong,\" Levi said. \"When I looked up tears came out of my eyes.\"\n\nLevi's bus driver later surprised him at school with some brand new pajamas.\n\nPeople as far as England and Portugal reached out to JCPS after their photo went viral.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nYared Nuguse takes bronze medal with a furious rally in historic Olympic 1500m\n\nIn August, Louisville watched one of its own race in the Olympics.\n\nManual graduate Yared Nuguse won a bronze medal in the men's 1500 meter race in Paris.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a long time since the Olympics, and I've just been taking it in for what it is, and just really believing internally that I am an Olympic bronze medalist,\" Nuguse said.\n\nThe runner got his start in high school when a teacher noticed him sprinting to McDonald's. Several years later, he sprinted across the finish line at the summer Olympics.\n\n\"Honestly, it's been pretty normal,\" he said. \"I only just finished my running season this weekend, so a lot of it has been normal training and stuff. But I'll get recognized at the grocery store a lot more, or little things like that. People are like, 'Oh my God, it's Yared.' And I'll be like, 'Oh, hi. What's up?'\"\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nLouisville's littlest lunch lady | Kind 2-year-old makes meals for trashmen every week\n\nTrash day was more than that for a 2-year-old girl in south Louisville.

The town's public works office later adopted the chicken after it laid an egg in someone's pickup truck. It's not clear why the chicken crossed the road though.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nLouisville attorney surprises teen with Taylor Swift tickets\n\nA Swiftie's wildest dreams came true this fall.\n\nWDRB was there as Louisville injury lawyer Sam Aguiar surprised 14-year-old Lola with tickets to the Taylor Swift concert in Indianapolis. The family has two children with down syndrome and got emotional at the surprise.\n\n\u201cWe looked around at several deserving families, and when I saw Lola\u2019s smile and learned more about the Rosenbaum family, I was hooked,\u201d Aguiar said.\n\nLola and her mom stood in the Swift merchandise line for hours before the concert and said it was worth it.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nMechanic proves Hoosiers are not lying about UFO sightings with his flying saucer car\n\nWDRB tracked down a street-legal UFO in southern Indiana. The mechanic behind it is Steve Anderson.\n\nThe Hoosier made headlines over the summer when he kept getting pulled over on the way to the UFO Festival in Roswell, New Mexico.\n\n\"The guy pulls me over, I have these glasses on and I go, 'I come in peace.' He starts laughing,\" Anderson said.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nCopyright 2024 WDRB Media. All Rights Reserved."

We explore every corner and sub-genre, from radical reinvention (In a Violent Nature) to classical scares (Oddity), and bring some of the most acclaimed horror films and series of each year in the process. Five of the Top 10 in this year\u2019s Rotten Tomatoes 'Best Horror' are Shudder titles, each with their own unique feel; from the rapturously received Late Night with the Devil, a crowd-pleasing talk show set terror, to the dazzling one-shot French film, MADS.\n\n\u201cAt Shudder, we\u2019re driven by filmmakers and our own taste, which we believe will in turn resonate with the members and subscribers who rally around us. We trust and think highly of our audience and believe that approach has been integral to strong brand recognition and growth. We also speak to audiences and what they love, building upon cult fan bases with new hit series The Creep Tapes or reality competition The Boulet Brothers\u2019 Dragula, and talking directly with them via socials and our own Halloween hotline, which I attend to personally.\u201d\n\nSave on a year's subscription to Shudder or try it out for free\n\nMadS is available to stream on Shudder in both the US and UK.

Silo\n\nAvailable on: Apple TV+ (U.S. and U.K.)\n\nSet in a world where all of humanity has been forced into underground silos for their survival, Silo\u2018s second season finally gives us a small look at the world outside of Juliette\u2019s (Rebecca Ferguson) silo. After being sent out to clean at the end of last season, we now follow Juliette as she journeys into a nearby silo, seemingly abandoned after an unsuccessful rebellion killed most of the population. However, Juliette isn\u2019t as alone in this new place as she thinks she is, and soon finds out that she may have to trust the mysterious stranger Solo (Steve Zahn) if she wants to find a way back home.\n\nBack in her home silo, a rebellion is brewing. Thousands of people saw Juliette survive outside far longer than any other person before her, leading to doubt in their leader, Bernard (Tim Robbins). The show may have expanded its scope beyond one silo, but things are just as tense and claustrophobic as ever. Despite being set sometime in humanity\u2019s future, Silo is also unexpectedly timely as we see more and more people come together against their oppressive leadership and uncover the truth about their existence. Community is one of the most important things we can cling to right now, and this season of Silo is a great reminder of how powerful we can be when we come together. \u2013 BA\n\n14.

After the shocking revelation of Nolan\u2019s (J.K. Simmons) true intentions for Earth, Mark (Steven Yeun) not only has to contend with the aftermath of losing who he thought his father was, but also with the question of how to continue his life as normal. But as Mark soon learns, life as a superhero is rarely ever normal.\n\nFrom parasitic alien hive minds to an impending Viltrumite invasion to discovering his father\u2019s secret alien love child, Mark does not have any easy go of it this season. And on top of it all, he tries to start college and maintain his relationship with Amber (Zazie Beetz). This season may not end with as jaw-dropping of a reveal as the previous one, but the storytelling, acting, and art of Invincible continues to be top-notch. \u2013 BA"

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve has identified five species new to global science: a gecko (Hemidactylus sp.) marked by brown stripes and white nodules, the Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus), plus three plants \u2014 a globe thistle, a mignonette, and a hogbean. In addition, the Reserve recorded three species new to Saudi Arabia and extended the known global range of 34 more. These outcomes, the result of four years of fieldwork by Saudi and international experts, increase the total number of terrestrial species documented in the Reserve to 791. Although the Reserve covers only 1% of the Kingdom's terrestrial area, it is home to more than half of Saudi Arabia's terrestrial species, reinforcing its role as a vital refuge for biodiversity in a changing climate.\n\nNewly discovered gecko Hemidactylus sp, in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve\n\nAndrew Zaloumis, CEO of the Reserve, emphasized the global significance of these findings, stating: \"At a moment in time when the IUCN has warned that 28% of species globally are now at risk of extinction these discoveries are significant. They reaffirm the importance of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve as a bioclimatic refugia, particularly as climate change is increasingly impacting the customary habitats of many of these species. Testament to this is the Reserve's iconic Wadi Al-Disah, with its 200+ species, a key site on the UNESCO World Heritage Bioclimatic Refugia of Western Arabia tentative list. None of this would have been possible without the strong collaboration of natural scientists from the Kingdom and 14 other countries with the Reserve over the last 4 years to conduct multi-season field surveys.\"\n\nAmong the five species new to science are two reptiles and three plants, each with unique ecological and cultural significance. The gecko (Hemidactylus sp.), currently undergoing DNA analysis, features striking brown horizontal stripes from neck to tail and white nodules along its back. This gecko preys on small invertebrates like mosquitoes, playing an essential role in pest control within desert ecosystems. The Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus) is a small, non-venomous species that is bright red with a distinctive black collar.\n\nThe three new plants to science are firstly the globe thistle (Echinops sp. aff. glaberrimus) from the Asteraceae family. It produces vibrant blooms that support pollinators and promote ecosystem health. Historically, it has been used medicinally to treat infections and inflammations. Secondly the mignonette, (Reseda sp. aff. muricata), known for its herbal properties, is often used in teas and perfumery. And thirdly, in contrast, the hogbean (Hyoscyamus sp.) from the Nightshade family has a more complex history, having been used both as a poison and in early anesthesiology and palliative care.\n\nStory Continues"

(Image: Johanna Weston/WHOI)\n\nThe ocean\u2019s deepest regions still hold many secrets. Despite covering 71% of Earth, over 95% of our oceans remain unexplored. The deep-sea ecosystem is home to bizarre life forms thriving under extreme conditions. A recent discovery has revealed a new species, expanding our understanding of these mysterious depths.\n\nIn the Atacama Trench, located off South America's coast, researchers found a new species of amphipod. Named Dulcibella camanchaca, this pale, ghostly creature was discovered at a depth of 7,902 meters. The species is remarkable for its predatory behaviour, marking a first in the deep-sea food web.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nDulcibella camanchaca: A New Addition to the Deep-Sea Ecosystem\n\nUnlike typical amphipods, which scavenge on organic matter, D. camanchaca actively hunts prey. This predatory nature makes it the first documented amphipod from the hadal zone\u2014depths below 6,000 meters. Researchers believe these deep-sea species can provide vital insights into ecosystems on other planets, such as Europa and Enceladus.\n\nRead Also: Scientists discover new pale blue damselfish species in Maldives' deep-sea reefs\n\nThe species name camanchaca, meaning \u201cdarkness\u201d in local languages, reflects its environment. These creatures survive in extreme conditions, including frigid temperatures, high pressure, and complete darkness. The D. camanchaca measures under 4 cm, with specialised appendages to capture prey.\n\nThe species name camanchaca, meaning \u201cdarkness\u201d in local languages, reflects its environment. (Johanna Weston/WHOI)\n\nA Step Forward in Deep-Sea Exploration\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe discovery was made during a 2023 expedition led by Chile\u2019s Integrated Deep-Ocean Observing System. Researchers used a lander vehicle equipped with baited traps to retrieve the specimens. This marks a significant milestone in exploring the Atacama Trench, a region rich in biodiversity.\n\nThe Atacama Trench is known for its isolation and high levels of sediment. This creates a unique environment where specialised species like Dulcibella camanchaca can evolve. Over the years, the trench has revealed a range of endemic species, including amphipods, snailfish, and mud dragons.\n\nRead Also: Male humpback whale crosses 8,000 miles across 3 oceans for sex; sets new distance record\n\nImportance of Protecting Our Ocean Ecosystems\n\nThe discovery of D. camanchaca adds to the growing list of endemic species in the trench. Scientists have confirmed it belongs to a new genus within the Eusiridae family. As a predatory species, D. camanchaca plays a crucial role in its deep-sea food web, hunting smaller organisms to maintain ecosystem balance.\n\nThis discovery underscores the importance of continued deep-sea exploration. It also highlights the need to protect these fragile ecosystems from threats like climate change and human activities. The ocean\u2019s depths still hold much to teach us, with each new species unveiling more of the planet\u2019s hidden wonders."

            "article_content": "Two breakthroughs in material science, both related to manipulating the arrangement of atoms in a material, were reported recently.\n\nThe first is the discovery of a new way of changing the phase of a material, from crystalline to amorphous, using an electrical pulse, which has the potential to revolutionise data storage in gadgets, mainly computer RAM. This new method consumes \u201ca billion times less electricity\u201d than the traditional melt-quench process, according to a paper published in Nature by researchers of IISc-Bengaluru, University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nElectronic storage devices use a type of glass called chalcogenide, which can change its phase from crystalline to amorphous (and back, when needed). In a solid, the atoms are in an ordered state. In an amorphous phase, the atoms are disordered, as in a liquid, but frozen into solid state \u2014 sort of a \u2018liquid in solid form\u2019. These two phases of a material are used to attribute the values \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 for storing data. The phase change from crystalline to amorphous is achieved by highly localised application of laser pulses, which consumes a lot of electricity. The crystals must be heated beyond 800 degrees C and then rapidly cooled. If there is a way to convert crystal directly to glass without the intermediate liquid phase, then the power required for memory storage can be greatly reduced.\n\nA group of 12 researchers have demonstrated amorphisation of indium selenide using pulsed electric current. The localised electric pulse causes the weakly bonded layers of the material to slide over each other, like tectonic plates \u2014 and, like the plates, they too generate a shock wave, explains one of the researchers, Dr Pavan Nukala of the Centre for Nanoscience and Engineering, IISc, Bengaluru. The wave propagates through the material and causes amorphisation.\n\nThis new process has immediate application in microelectronics, but is really a breakthrough in material science as it shows a new way of thinking about amorphisation, he tells Quantum.\n\nDesired misfit\n\nThe second discovery \u2014 by a team led by Prof Kanishka Biswas, New Chemistry Unit, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bengaluru \u2014 has led to the synthesis of a new material with high potential for conversion of waste heat into electricity. The group researched into ferecrystals, a class of \u2018misfit layered compounds\u2019 (MLC) \u2014 so called because their atomic layers are misaligned, like an uneven stack of cards.\n\nMLCs have an interesting property \u2014 they do not allow the smooth conduction of heat and thereby block heat transfers. This ultra-low thermal conductivity creates a heat gradient across the material. According to the \u2018Seebeck effect\u2019, discovered in 1821, wherever there is a heat gradient, the material can also generate electricity.\n\nThe ferecrystal material shows a \u2018thermoelectric figure of merit\u2019 of 2.3, a high number that means the material can convert a lot of heat into electricity.\n\n\u201cThe material is already generating electricity in the lab. However, it needs to be scaled up for practical use,\u201d Biswas says.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

            "article_content": "OpenAI rolled out a new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for ChatGPT on Friday. The new feature, dubbed Projects in ChatGPT or just Projects, allows users to create specific chat folders where they can ask questions about the same topic or about topics with the same context. With the ability to add files in Projects, the feature is similar to Google's NotebookLM. The AI firm highlighted that while the paid subscribers of the chatbot will get the feature in the next few days, Edu and Enterprise users will get it by January 2025.\n\nOn day seven of the company's 12-day shipping schedule, Projects in ChatGPT was released. The feature was announced during a live stream and was later posted by the AI firm's official handle on X (formerly known as Twitter). Currently, the feature is available to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users globally. Free users will also get this feature eventually, but OpenAI did not mention any release date for it.\n\nOn the surface, Projects can be understood as an organising tool that allows users to segregate chats by topics. This is useful when a user asks frequent questions about the same topic and does not wish to add full context every time. For instance, users can create a Project titled \u201cResearch Assignment\u201d and tell the chatbot to respond to queries as an expert in the field. This way, they do not have to repeat the instructions as long as they use the same Project.\n\nHowever, the feature can also be a very useful research tool with its Google NotebookLM-like capabilities. Just like Google's platform, Projects also allows users to add files. Once added, every response by ChatGPT keeps the context of the documents in mind. Users can also use this capability to ask questions about a large document or research paper.\n\nProjects in ChatGPT\n\nPhoto Credit: X/OpenAI\n\nThe feature, once available, will show on the left margin of ChatGPT's Web interface and desktop app. The feature is currently not available on the ChatGPT app on Android and iOS. Titled Projects, users can tap on the \u2018+' icon next to the header to create a new folder. These folders are customisable and users can add preferred titles, emojis, and even change the folder colour.\n\nOnce done, users can either add custom instructions or upload files to ground the chatbot's responses. The interface also shows the previous chats of the user for easy access. Additionally, users can also access the ChatGPT Search and Canvas feature within Projects. Once a folder is created, it will show up under the Projects header on the left margin."

            "article_content": "Editor's take: A complex legal and ethical battle is unfolding over whether OpenAI can switch to for-profit status. The result could have significant implications for AI development as well as the delicate balance between nonprofit missions and for-profit ambitions in the tech industry.\n\nMeta Platforms has entered the fray in the ongoing dispute between OpenAI and Elon Musk, urging California's Attorney General Rob Bonta to block OpenAI's planned transition to a for-profit company. This move aligns Meta with Musk in a battle that pits some of Silicon Valley's most influential AI players against each other.\n\nMeta wrote to Attorney General Bonta last week, arguing that allowing OpenAI to become a for-profit entity would set a dangerous precedent. The social media giant contends that such a move would enable startups to exploit the benefits of nonprofit status until they are on the brink of profitability.\n\n\"OpenAI's conduct could have seismic implications for Silicon Valley,\" Meta stated in the letter. The company further elaborated on the potential consequences, suggesting that if OpenAI's new business model is deemed valid, it could lead to a situation where \"non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\"\n\nIn response to these concerns, OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor has assured that the company will maintain a nonprofit arm following any potential restructuring. This nonprofit entity would retain full value in its ownership stake of the for-profit division and have \"an enhanced ability to pursue its mission\" of ensuring AI benefits humanity.\n\nThe dispute between OpenAI and Elon Musk has been ongoing, with Musk filing a series of legal complaints against the AI company. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 but left in 2018 amid a power struggle, has accused the company of betraying its original nonprofit mission and colluding with Microsoft, its largest investor, to dominate AI development.\n\nMeta's involvement in this conflict is hardly surprising, given its position as one of OpenAI's biggest competitors. The company has invested billions in developing its own AI technology to rival ChatGPT. Also, OpenAI has close alliances with Microsoft and Apple, both major competitors of Meta.\n\nIn its letter, Meta expressed support for Musk and Shivon Zilis, a business and personal associate, in their efforts to represent public interests regarding OpenAI's potential transition to for-profit status. \"Although we ask your office to take direct action, we believe that Mr. Musk and Ms. Zilis are qualified and well-positioned to represent the interests of Californians in this matter,\" Meta wrote.\n\nThe conflict has intensified recently, with OpenAI publishing internal documents to counter Musk's request for a preliminary injunction to block its transition to a for-profit company. These documents \u2013 as well as a post by OpenAI \u2013 state that Musk had previously supported the idea of a for-profit structure for OpenAI.\n\n\"When he didn't get majority equity and full control, he walked away and told us we would fail,\" OpenAI wrote."

            "article_content": "5 Trends In Digital Therapeutics For 2025\n\nBy Acacia Parks, Ph.D., MBA, CEO, Liquid Amber\n\nDespite industry pitfalls we\u2019ve seen in the past, digital therapeutics (DTx) are poised to gain momentum by showcasing their viability in addressing unmet healthcare needs, improving patient outcomes, and complementing traditional treatments over the next year.\n\nExpansion In Mental Health And Other Therapeutic Areas\n\nDTx has traditionally been rooted in areas like mental health and chronic disease management, and we\u2019ll continue to see developers drive innovation in these areas \u2014 bringing new digital therapies to market and refining existing technologies, especially in new indications where there are no or limited existing digital health interventions.\n\nFor example, Pfizer recently released a new digital application for migraine management that helps patients better understand and manage their symptoms through personalized insights and education. Given the prevalence and global burden of migraines, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see more manufacturers homing in on this condition as well.\n\nThe digital health sector also will expand to new therapeutic domains, including:\n\nOncology: Used to complement patients\u2019 existing oncology care, DTx products are emerging as a valuable tool in addressing side effects such as pain, nausea, and fatigue, as well as anxiety and depression associated with cancer diagnoses.\n\nUsed to complement patients\u2019 existing oncology care, DTx products are emerging as a valuable tool in addressing side effects such as pain, nausea, and fatigue, as well as anxiety and depression associated with cancer diagnoses. Women\u2019s health: With helpful features such as symptom tracking, behavioral coaching, telehealth, and more, the women\u2019s health sector will continue to see rapid adoption of digital therapeutics.\n\nWith helpful features such as symptom tracking, behavioral coaching, telehealth, and more, the women\u2019s health sector will continue to see rapid adoption of digital therapeutics. Pediatric conditions: We\u2019ve seen DTx interventions transform pediatric care by tackling ADHD, autism, and anxiety with engaging, interactive designs to address their symptoms.\n\nEvolving Approaches To FDA Interactions\n\nAs the industry continues to mature, DTx companies need to continue engaging with the FDA early and often as they develop their products. This includes meeting with the Agency to gauge their thoughts on endpoints, study designs, and statistical approaches before conducting a trial, as well as at key milestones throughout development, such as the conclusion of a study.\n\nLack of robust clinical evidence, issues with data privacy, and regulatory missteps encompass the challenges developers face in obtaining FDA approval for their digital therapies. Many companies approach the FDA expecting to be guided on how to conduct their research or obtain clearance, which can delay the start of trials or market approval, especially if studies have already been conducted without a clear understanding of what\u2019s needed for clinical validation. I\u2019m hopeful that these companies will learn from their and others\u2019 mistakes going into the next year.\n\nThe Future Of DTx And Healthcare Provider Partnerships\n\nSeamless integration of DTx into clinical workflows will require stronger partnerships between DTx companies and healthcare providers. In 2025, these collaborations will be driven by co-design initiatives where providers play a central role in shaping the design and deployment of digital therapies. This will ensure that DTx tools address real-world challenges, such as fitting within the constraints of short appointment times or interfacing with existing electronic health records (EHRs).\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019ll see a rise in clinical decision support (CDS) tools that integrate with DTx platforms, equipping providers with actionable insights to guide patient care. The success of these partnerships will hinge on DTx companies\u2019 ability to demonstrate the simplicity, scalability, and tangible value of their solutions within the realities of modern clinical practice.\n\nPredictions For Reimbursement Models\n\nReimbursement remains one of the greatest challenges for the DTx industry. However, in July of this year, the CMS introduced a potential new reimbursement pathway for \"digital mental health treatment\" (DMHT) devices and services in its 2025 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Proposed Rule. This marks a monumental milestone for the DTx industry, where insurance companies have yet to offer reimbursement.\n\nThe introduction of three new codes anticipated for 2025 could pave the way for Medicare reimbursement frameworks for the treatment of chronic diseases and other therapeutic areas. This development has the potential to enhance the credibility of digital therapeutics by highlighting their ability to deliver measurable health outcomes. Ideally, it could also encourage the private insurance sector to adopt similar approaches.\n\nThe three proposed codes will reimburse physicians for:\n\nGMBT1: Prescribing FDA-approved DTx devices for mental health\n\nPrescribing FDA-approved DTx devices for mental health GMBT2: The first 20 minutes of managing a patient\u2019s DTx device each month\n\nThe first 20 minutes of managing a patient\u2019s DTx device each month GMBT3: Each additional 20 minutes of management\n\nAI-Driven Innovation\n\nAI and ML will continue to redefine DTx development and delivery in 2025, accelerating innovation and transforming patient outcomes. AI-powered algorithms will enable hyper-personalized interventions in real time, adapting content and strategies based on user data. These advancements will enhance engagement and treatment efficacy, ensuring that patients receive the most effective therapy for their unique needs. At the same time, strong evidence-generation programs will help to differentiate science-backed products from the thousands of digital health products out there that are not based in, or tested by, science.\n\nOn the operational side, we\u2019ll see more sponsors and CROs integrating AI within their everyday workflows. Companies will continue to leverage AI to streamline clinical trial design by identifying ideal patient populations and optimizing study endpoints through predictive analytics, reducing time and costs. AI also has untapped potential to improve diversity in trial populations with natural language processing (NLP) tools to provide translation services, remote monitoring to allow virtual participation, and data-driven site selection to identify sites with specific demographic populations. This sets the stage for developers to demonstrate value to payers by forecasting long-term outcomes and cost savings with greater precision.\n\nA Call To Action For DTx Innovators\n\nTo thrive in 2025, DTx companies must prioritize collaboration with regulators, healthcare providers, and payers. Proactive engagement, combined with a relentless focus on evidence generation and user-centric design, will enable the industry to realize its full potential. By building trust and demonstrating value across stakeholders, DTx has the opportunity to not only transform individual patient care but also redefine how we deliver healthcare on a global scale. The steps we take today will determine how quickly and effectively these innovations can make a lasting impact on patients' lives.\n\nAbout The Author:\n\nAcacia Parks, Ph.D., MBA, who serves as an advisor to Lindus Health, is a digital health executive whose experience revolves around scientific, product, and regulatory strategy for digital therapeutics/software as medical device (SAMD).

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve has identified five species new to global science: a gecko (Hemidactylus sp.) marked by brown stripes and white nodules, the Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus), plus three plants \u2014 a globe thistle, a mignonette, and a hogbean. In addition, the Reserve recorded three species new to Saudi Arabia and extended the known global range of 34 more. These outcomes, the result of four years of fieldwork by Saudi and international experts, increase the total number of terrestrial species documented in the Reserve to 791. Although the Reserve covers only 1% of the Kingdom's terrestrial area, it is home to more than half of Saudi Arabia's terrestrial species, reinforcing its role as a vital refuge for biodiversity in a changing climate.\n\nNewly discovered gecko Hemidactylus sp, in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve\n\nAndrew Zaloumis, CEO of the Reserve, emphasized the global significance of these findings, stating: \"At a moment in time when the IUCN has warned that 28% of species globally are now at risk of extinction these discoveries are significant. They reaffirm the importance of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve as a bioclimatic refugia, particularly as climate change is increasingly impacting the customary habitats of many of these species. Testament to this is the Reserve's iconic Wadi Al-Disah, with its 200+ species, a key site on the UNESCO World Heritage Bioclimatic Refugia of Western Arabia tentative list. None of this would have been possible without the strong collaboration of natural scientists from the Kingdom and 14 other countries with the Reserve over the last 4 years to conduct multi-season field surveys.\"\n\nAmong the five species new to science are two reptiles and three plants, each with unique ecological and cultural significance. The gecko (Hemidactylus sp.), currently undergoing DNA analysis, features striking brown horizontal stripes from neck to tail and white nodules along its back. This gecko preys on small invertebrates like mosquitoes, playing an essential role in pest control within desert ecosystems. The Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus) is a small, non-venomous species that is bright red with a distinctive black collar.\n\nThe three new plants to science are firstly the globe thistle (Echinops sp. aff. glaberrimus) from the Asteraceae family. It produces vibrant blooms that support pollinators and promote ecosystem health. Historically, it has been used medicinally to treat infections and inflammations. Secondly the mignonette, (Reseda sp. aff. muricata), known for its herbal properties, is often used in teas and perfumery. And thirdly, in contrast, the hogbean (Hyoscyamus sp.) from the Nightshade family has a more complex history, having been used both as a poison and in early anesthesiology and palliative care.\n\nStory Continues"

Antiquity, December 2024. CREDIT: Schulting et al. Antiquity, December 2024.\n\nSearching for motivation\u2013and a reason for cannibalism\n\nThe skulls have evidence of a violent death from blunt force trauma, unlike the majority of contemporary burials. Researchers from multiple institutions further analyzed the bones to try and learn more about how these people died. They found several cutmarks and fractures that occurred at or near the time of death on the bones. The team believes that this is evidence that they were intentionally butchered and may have been partly consumed.\n\nTo find clues to why people in Early Bronze Age Britain might cannibalize their dead, they looked at the nearby Palaeolithic site of Gough\u2019s Cave in Cheddar Gorge. Evidence uncovered there suggests that cannibalism was likely a funeral rite in the area. However, Charterhouse Warren is a bit different. The evidence of a violent death with no indication of a fight or struggle implies that the victims were caught off guard. The team believes it is likely that they were all massacred and the butchering was done by their enemies.\n\n[ Related: Bronze Age village was \u2018pretty cozy\u2019\u2014until Britain\u2019s Pompeii. ]\n\nAbundant cattle bones have been found mixed in with the human bones suggests that people at Charterhouse Warren probably had enough to eat, so it is unlikely that they were killed strictly for food.\n\nInstead, cannibalism may have been a way to \u201cother\u201d and dehumanize the deceased. The killers were likening their enemies to animals by eating their flesh and mixing their bones in with animal bones.\n\n\u2018People in prehistory could match more recent atrocities\u2019\n\nThe conflict was likely caused by social factors. Theft or insults may have led to tensions which then escalated out of proportion. Additionally, two of the children had evidence of plague in their teeth. The fear of such a deadly illness may have also exacerbated tensions. Scientists at the The Francis Crick Institute found these signs of plague at Charterhouse Warren in a 2023 study and they were a \u201ccompletely unexpected\u201d finding, according to Schulting. However, the team still does not know what\u2013if any\u2013impact plague had on this conflict.\n\nRight hemi-mandible of child aged about 10 years (a) with detail of cutmarks on the ascending ramus (b).

Antiquity, December 2024.\n\nAs a whole, the discovery of such violence at Charterhouse Warren shows that in at least this instance, perceived slights and cycles of revenge could result in violent actions.\n\n\u201cCharterhouse Warren is one of those rare archaeological sites that challenges the way we think about the past,\u201d said Schulting. \u201cIt is a stark reminder that people in prehistory could match more recent atrocities and shines a light on a dark side of human behaviour. That it is unlikely to have been a one-off event makes it even more important that its story is told.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Cloud security startup Wiz has grown rapidly in just four years, raising $1.9 billion along the way.\n\nThe AI boom has accelerated cloud adoption, says Raaz Herzberg, the CMO of Wiz.\n\nWiz rejected a $23 billion Google acquisition offer in July and said it plans to IPO instead.\n\nIn early 2020, Raaz Herzberg was a product manager at Microsoft Azure when she was offered a position at Wiz, a newly created cloud security startup. Since then, Wiz has turned down a $23 billion takeover offer from Google, expanded into Europe, and reached $500 million in annual recurring revenue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts next priority is to double that revenue metric \u2014 and then become a public company that Herzberg believes can become the biggest in the cybersecurity market.\n\nWiz was launched by four cofounders who sold their previous business, Adallom, to Microsoft. It bills itself as a cloud security company that helps companies identify risks in their cloud providers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It felt like an opportunity I couldn't possibly pass on,\" Herzberg, now the chief marketing officer and vice president of product strategy at Wiz, told Business Insider in an interview from the company's new London office. \"I started as head of product \u2014 but we started in the worst time. This was March 2020, when COVID-19 started,\" she said. \"It's easy to remember because everything changed immediately.\"\n\nIt turned out that the pandemic was a boon for business. As more companies shifted to remote work, they increasingly relied on cloud services \u2014 expanding Wiz's client base. Four years since its launch, the scaleup has raised over $1.9 billion in funding from investing heavyweights such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and Index Ventures.\n\nIt now sees huge opportunities to use the AI boom to cement its position in the market before it launches its initial public offering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAI adoption has supercharged Wiz's business\n\nCloud computing offers crucial infrastructure underpinning AI applications. As more companies rush to adopt AI, security and privacy have taken center stage.\n\n\"The adoption of AI is very similar to what happened with the accelerated use of cloud,\" Herzberg said. Wiz has found that over 80% of its customers are using AI services \u2014 which \"are, in some ways, like cloud services. Companies don't buy their machines or chips, so they're using these technologies on the cloud,\" she added.\n\n\"Part of the reason we're growing so fast is because we have access to the public cloud, which is growing incredibly fast \u2014 and AI only pushes that growth further,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause AI services are often used on public clouds \u2014 a service offered by third parties rather than an internal network \u2014 cloud security has become a critical issue.\n\nWiz's rapid growth has also been bolstered by its arsenal of acquisitions. This year, it scooped up security startups Rafft, Gem, and Dazz in a bid to bulk up its engineering talent and product suite.\n\n\"When we acquire companies, we don't sell their product. They rebuild it from scratch in the Wiz infrastructure,\" Herzberg told BI, noting that the company is still on the hunt for more acquisitions. \"We believe in this concept of growing inorganically.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEuropean expansion on the road to IPO\n\nWiz's global headquarters is in New York, with offices in Virginia, Texas, Colorado, and Israel. In August 2024, Wiz established its European headquarters in London. Its plush office is a short walk from Silicon Roundabout \u2014 London's scaled-down answer to Silicon Valley.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"The European market has been an ideal fit for our technology because it's more constrained by security, and more privacy aware than the US market,\" Herzberg told BI. \"We estimate we will be able to get 35% of our revenue from Europe.\"\n\nWiz works with industry heavyweights on the continent, such as Revolut, Tide, and BMW. In 2024, it says it reached $500 million in ARR \u2014 but is aiming to reach $1 billion before it IPOs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOperating independently is a big priority for the company. Earlier this year, Wiz turned down a $23 billion offer from Google, instead opting to prime itself for a public debut.\n\nHerzberg declined to comment about the Google deal but added that Wiz had lofty ambitions to establish itself as a market leader in the cloud security domain.\n\n\"We are building a company that I believe can be the biggest cybersecurity company in the world,\" she said. \"And I think at this point we are on that path.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe likened companies buying security services to buying insurance packages, pointing to incumbents in the security industry with a similar model.\n\n\"So if I look at the wing of, for example, network security firewalls, it has a clear leader \u2014 people today buy Palo Alto firewalls. They used to buy checkpoint firewalls. Now the leader is Palo Alto,\" she said. \"Another example would be like the endpoint production server protection, that's a big domain on its own, and then it has a clear leader, like CrowdStrike.\"\n\nAs the public cloud domain balloons, Herzberg believed there needs to be a \"leader in place to protect that domain\" \u2014 adding that Wiz had a goal of taking that mantle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowth ambitions\n\nA slate of elections this year has pushed the company to prepare for more government-mandated cybersecurity measures, especially in the US. In anticipation of Donald Trump's second term, Wiz has started building on a federal sales strategy.\n\nStill, Herzberg said the scaleup is in \"no rush\" to go public. It's now looking for a chief finance officer, a requirement for companies that want to IPO.\n\n\"With the place we are at in terms of revenue and publicity and everything, it just brings us better candidates than we had as little as a year ago,\" Herzberg said. \"I don't think we necessarily need someone with cloud security experience,\" she added. \"We're hoping to announce that hire soon.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere, it's gearing up to release two new products as it cements its presence in Europe with an impending hiring spree.\n\nStill, the team hopes to come full circle to its New York roots by the time it's ready to IPO.\n\n\"Which one has the gong?\" Herzberg laughed. \"New York is where we'd list.\""

            "article_content": "Elon Musk and Sam Altman, once collaborators in the creation of OpenAI, now find themselves at the forefront of a growing rivalry that is transforming the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. Their public disagreements highlight critical issues, including the balance between transparency and competition, the ethical challenges of AI development, and the tension between profit-driven goals and altruistic intentions. This rivalry, marked by accusations, strategic moves, and legal disputes, underscores the broader challenges the AI industry faces as it navigates rapid advancements and societal expectations.\n\nWhat began as a shared vision for advancing AI has evolved into a public and deeply personal competition between Musk and Altman. Their conflict encapsulates a larger conversation about transparency, ethics, and the delicate balance between innovation and responsibility in a fast-moving industry. This story sheds light on how ideals often clash with the profit-driven realities of the modern tech world.\n\nElon Musk vs Sam Altman\n\nMore than just a tale of competing personalities, this rivalry reflects the growing pains of an industry shaping the future of humanity. As Musk and Altman take bold steps to outpace one another, they force critical questions into the spotlight: Can AI development remain true to its original altruistic principles? And what happens when the drive for dominance in AI overshadows collaboration? While the answers remain complex, the implications of this competition could not be more significant.\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Elon Musk and Sam Altman, once collaborators at OpenAI, are now rivals, highlighting critical issues in AI development such as transparency, ethics, and the balance between profit and altruism.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s shift from a nonprofit to a for-profit model, along with its partnership with Microsoft, has sparked controversy and accusations of betraying its founding mission.\n\nThe Musk-Altman feud underscores tensions in AI leadership, with Musk criticizing Altman for deviating from OpenAI\u2019s original goals, while Altman defends the shift as necessary for competitiveness.\n\nMusk has launched legal challenges against OpenAI and started his own AI venture, xAI, intensifying competition and driving rapid innovation in the AI sector.\n\nThe rivalry raises broader questions about the ethical and regulatory frameworks needed to guide AI development, with implications for the future of technology and society.\n\nTheir conflict is not merely personal but emblematic of the larger debates surrounding AI\u2019s future. As two of the most influential figures in technology, Musk and Altman\u2019s actions and decisions are shaping the trajectory of AI innovation, raising questions about how to ensure that these powerful technologies benefit humanity as a whole.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Controversial Shift\n\nOpenAI was founded with a bold mission: to ensure that artificial intelligence serves the greater good of humanity. Initially structured as a nonprofit organization, it embraced open source principles to counterbalance the dominance of major tech corporations like Google. However, OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit model has sparked significant controversy, with critics arguing that this shift undermines its founding ideals.\n\nElon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has been one of the most vocal critics of this transformation. He has accused the organization of abandoning its commitment to transparency and prioritizing financial gain over ethical considerations. OpenAI\u2019s close partnership with Microsoft, which has invested billions into the organization, has further fueled these concerns. Critics argue that this relationship compromises OpenAI\u2019s independence and raises questions about whether its decisions are driven by profit motives rather than its original mission.\n\nThe shift has become a focal point in the broader debate over the role of ethics in AI development. It highlights the challenges organizations face in balancing the need for resources with the imperative to maintain public trust and uphold their stated values.\n\nClash of Leadership: Musk vs Altman\n\nThe personal and professional rift between Elon Musk and Sam Altman has become a defining narrative in the AI industry. Musk has publicly criticized Altman, accusing him of steering OpenAI away from its original mission and prioritizing personal and organizational gain. Altman, in response, has defended his leadership, asserting that OpenAI\u2019s transition was necessary to secure the resources required to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.\n\nThis feud has played out in public forums, with Musk making pointed remarks about Altman\u2019s leadership style and even comparing him to a manipulative character from *Game of Thrones*. Altman, for his part, has emphasized the challenges of leading an organization in an industry where innovation moves at breakneck speed and decisions have far-reaching implications.\n\nThe conflict between Musk and Altman underscores a broader tension in the AI sector: how to balance the drive for rapid technological progress with the need for ethical responsibility. It also highlights the complexities of leadership in an industry where the stakes are extraordinarily high, both in terms of societal impact and competitive pressures.\n\nElon Musks NEW Plans To Crush Sam Altman And OpenAI\n\nBrowse through more resources below from our in-depth content covering more areas on OpenAI :\n\nLegal Battles and Competitive Moves\n\nElon Musk has not limited his opposition to public criticism. He has taken legal action to challenge OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit model, alleging that the organization has engaged in anti-competitive practices. Musk has also accused OpenAI of granting Microsoft unfair access to sensitive information, which he claims gives the company a significant competitive advantage.\n\nAt the same time, Musk has launched his own AI initiative, xAI, which directly competes with OpenAI. By securing substantial resources, including a large supply of Nvidia GPUs, Musk aims to develop advanced AI technologies that could rival or surpass OpenAI\u2019s capabilities. This move has intensified competition within the AI sector, pushing both organizations to innovate at an accelerated pace.\n\nThe rivalry between Musk and Altman has significant implications for the industry. It is driving advancements in AI technology but also raising concerns about the potential consequences of unchecked competition. As both leaders pursue their visions, the industry must grapple with questions about fairness, transparency, and the broader societal impact of their innovations.\n\nAltman\u2019s Defense and Ongoing Challenges\n\nSam Altman has remained steadfast in defending OpenAI\u2019s evolution, arguing that the shift to a for-profit model was essential to secure the funding and resources needed to achieve its ambitious goals. He has emphasized that the organization remains committed to its mission of making sure that AI benefits humanity, even as it navigates the complexities of a competitive market.\n\nHowever, Altman faces significant challenges. OpenAI has struggled with resource limitations, particularly in acquiring Nvidia chips, which are critical for training advanced AI models. In contrast, Musk\u2019s xAI has reportedly secured a larger supply of these chips, giving it a potential edge in the race to develop innovative AI technologies.\n\nAltman\u2019s leadership is under intense scrutiny as he works to address these challenges while maintaining transparency and trust. The demands of leading an organization at the forefront of AI innovation are immense, and Altman\u2019s ability to navigate these pressures will play a crucial role in shaping OpenAI\u2019s future.\n\nImplications for the Future of AI\n\nThe rivalry between Elon Musk and Sam Altman extends beyond their personal disagreements, shedding light on critical issues that will shape the future of artificial intelligence. As competition intensifies, questions arise about the role of profit motives in driving innovation and whether organizations can balance financial interests with the altruistic goal of creating AI that benefits humanity.\n\nThis conflict highlights the complexities of leadership, trust, and innovation in an industry with fantastic potential. It raises important questions about how to ensure that AI development aligns with ethical principles and societal needs, rather than being driven solely by competitive pressures or financial incentives.\n\nThe outcome of this rivalry will likely have far-reaching implications, influencing not only the pace of technological advancements but also the ethical frameworks that guide the development and deployment of AI. As Musk and Altman continue to shape the industry, their decisions will play a pivotal role in determining the trajectory of artificial intelligence and its impact on society.\n\nMedia Credit: TheAIGRID\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s note: This story contains graphic and disturbing descriptions of violence.\n\nKyiv, Ukraine CNN \u2014\n\nPastor Dmytro Bodyu said the Russians kept telling him they knew he was an American spy, specifically, a CIA agent paid by the US government to spread anti-Russian propaganda in occupied Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThey said they knew for sure because all Protestant churches and Catholic churches are working with the American secret services, and all their pastors work for the US government, because the Protestant church is not a real church,\u201d Bodyu, the founder of the evangelical Word of Life Church in Melitopol, told CNN.\n\nFifteen or so armed men, who said they were from the Russian police and FSB spy agency, stormed into Bodyu\u2019s home early on March 19, 2022. They arrested him in front of his terrified wife and son and took him to a local police station where he said they shoved him into a small cell and threatened him with execution.\n\nHe was released eight days later, but the threats and harassment continued. Bodyu said he was given an ultimatum: to continue preaching, he\u2019d have to cooperate. His sermons would be subject to censorship and observed by the authorities, and he would have to share personal and potentially compromising information about his parishioners with the Russians.\n\nThe pastor said that he refused and was eventually forced to leave the occupied southern Ukrainian city. His congregation was decimated and his church shut down as part of Russia\u2019s brutal crackdown against Ukrainian religious groups that are not affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nSince launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has jailed dozens of Ukrainian faith leaders in occupied areas, according to Ukrainian prosecutors. After threatening them with lengthy prison sentences, torture and even death, Russian and Russian-installed authorities have forced numerous other priests, pastors and imams into exile.\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman of the 95th Air Assault Brigade holds the Bible during a prayer before their departure to the frontline in the Donetsk region on February 22, 2023. Yasuyoshi/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt the same time, Ukrainian authorities have become increasingly suspicious of anyone with links to the Russian Orthodox Church, arresting and convicting clergymen of spying for Moscow. US embassy officials, including the US ambassador to Ukraine, have urged the Ukrainian government and religious leaders to ensure respect for all individuals\u2019 religious freedom.\n\nCNN spoke to six religious leaders representing different Christian denominations across several currently or formerly occupied Ukrainian cities, including Melitopol, Berdiansk and Kherson, who were detained. They said Russian authorities accused them of being American spies or of spreading propaganda. Three described being physically abused, one of them sexually. All were told their religious affiliations were the reason for their detention.\n\nThe crackdown goes beyond people and congregations. Evidence found in liberated areas and seen in satellite images shows Russian forces have destroyed and looted multiple religious sites and desecrated monuments, churches and monasteries across occupied areas. The Centre for Information Resilience, a UK-based nonprofit that documents potential human rights violations, identified some 158 religious sites that were destroyed or damaged in the first two years of the full-scale conflict.\n\nA woman bicycles by a burned vehicle in front of a damaged church in Lukashivka, near the city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, on April 22, 2022.

Hong/AP\n\nAccording to international legal experts and Ukrainian prosecutors, Russia\u2019s religious persecutions in Ukraine amount to war crimes.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry, the government body responsible for the occupied areas of Ukraine, has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the allegations.\n\nRussia\u2019s Crimea playbook\n\nBohdan Heleta, a priest of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, spent more than 19 months in Russian detention after he and his fellow priest Ivan Levitsky were abducted by masked men with rifles from their parish in Berdiansk on November 16, 2022.\n\nThey were held in several detention facilities in Berdiansk before being transferred to the notoriously brutal Horlivka Penal Colony in the occupied Donetsk region where they ended up spending more than a year. They said they were accused of \u201cconducting propaganda\u201d and were repeatedly beaten and kept in solitary confinement. They had their hair and beards shaved off and were interrogated many times, with their tormentors trying to pressure them into cooperating with the Russian intelligence services.\n\n\u201cThere were 1,500 to 2,000 people there, in barracks for 200 people each,\u201d Heleta told CNN a few weeks after his release, adding that some had been detained for nearly three years. \u201cThree times a day, at breakfast, lunch and dinner, you had to run through two rows of special forces who would beat you. In the dining hall, when you eat, they also beat you and shock you with electric current.\u201d\n\nBohdan Heleta, a priest who was detained inside his own Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the occupied city of Berdiansk in 2022, smiles at Kyiv airport on June 29, 2024, after he was freed in a prisoner swap. Alex Babenko/AP\n\nHeleta and Levitsky were freed in a prisoner swap in June. Neither was charged or convicted of any crime, which is common for many of the thousands of Ukrainian civilians who have been detained by Russia since the start of the war.\n\nMaksym Vishchyk, a lawyer at Global Rights Compliance, a non-profit that advises the Ukrainian authorities on investigating and prosecuting international crimes, said Heleta\u2019s experiences match those of other priests and religious leaders detained by Russia.\n\nEarlier this year, Ukrainian authorities filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court\u2019s Prosecutor\u2019s Office alleging atrocities perpetrated by Russia against religious communities in Crimea. Vishchyk, who assisted the Ukrainians with the submission, said the evidence points to Russian policies amounting to \u201cat least nine war crimes and seven crimes against humanity,\u201d including depriving a person of fundamental rights based on their religious identity.\n\nAnd while the submission focused on Crimea, Vishchyk stressed that Russia is carrying out the same abuses across the occupied Ukrainian territories \u2013 drawing from the playbook established in the peninsula since 2014 and doubling down.\n\n\u201cIn Crimea, it was kind of gradual. In the territories occupied after February 2022, Russian tactics became bloodier and more violent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations\u2019\n\nThe repressions against religious groups in Ukraine appear to be part of Moscow\u2019s efforts to \u201cRussify\u201d areas under its control.\n\n\u201cRussia wants to eradicate anything Ukrainian. Remove any reminders of Ukrainian identity or Ukrainian history, and make the occupied territory Russian,\u201d Vishchyk said. \u201cThis includes making Russian Orthodoxy the dominant mainstream ideology.\u201d\n\nFreedom of religion is severely restricted in Russia, despite guarantees in the country\u2019s constitution and Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s insistence that his country is a \u201cmulti-confessional\u201d society. The most recent US State Department report into international religious freedoms said Russia has engaged in \u201csystematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.\u201d\n\nWhile Russia has no official state religion, the law recognizes the \u201cspecial role\u201d of Orthodoxy in the history and culture of the country. And Putin has long made faith part of his brand, regularly turning to the church for support. The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, is one of Putin\u2019s staunchest backers and a vocal supporter of the war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile religion has become a major part of the war, the battle over Orthodoxy started long before the current full-scale conflict. Ukraine created its own independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine in 2018, splitting from the Moscow-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). Since then, religious affiliation has increasingly been viewed as a symbol of national loyalty.\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman takes a photograph of a church damaged in shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine, on March 10, 2022. Russian forces seized Mariupol two months later, after a brutal siege. Evgeniy Maloletka/AP\n\nUkrainian intelligence services have opened criminal proceedings against dozens of priests accused of spreading pro-Russian propaganda. Several have been convicted of high treason, collaboration and aiding the aggressor state and sentenced to years-long jail terms.\n\nThe UOC has repeatedly tried to separate itself from Moscow, declaring itself independent in 2022. But an investigation by Ukraine\u2019s State Service for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience concluded the church remains in the Kremlin\u2019s orbit.\n\nEarlier this year, Kyiv ordered churches to cut ties with the Russian Orthodox Church or risk being banned, citing security concerns. Human rights groups have criticized the new law as \u201coverly broad,\u201d warning it could have consequences for Ukrainians\u2019 right to religious freedoms. UOC representatives have accused members of the OCU of seizing its churches by force. Putin meanwhile has accused Kyiv of religious persecution.\n\nPriest hooded, stripped naked\n\nOnly state-approved religious organizations are allowed to operate in Russia, and officials can ban any group they deem \u201cextremist\u201d and \u201cundesirable.\u201d Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Church of Scientology, Falun Gong, and multiple Protestant and Islamist groups have all been banned and their leaders and members prosecuted, according to the State Department report.\n\nThe same is now true in occupied Ukraine, where religious groups must apply for an official registration, effectively pledging obedience to the Russian regime. Those that don\u2019t are automatically banned, and their leaders at risk of being accused of extremism.\n\nSerhii Chudynovych, a priest of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, says he was one of those Russia tried to coerce into complying. When Ukraine came under attack, he turned his church in Kherson into a humanitarian center, flying a large Ukrainian flag above the entrance even after Russian troops rolled into the city.\n\nSerhii Chudynovych was detained and tortured by Russian forces in March 2022, when Kherson was under Russian occupation. CNN\n\nOn March 30, 2022, he was detained by a group of masked men in civilian clothes, who told him and his parishioners that they were from the police. Chudynovych told CNN the men took him to a local administrative building where he said they stripped him naked, put a hood over his head, tied his hands behind his back and started beating him. \u201cThey twisted my arms and started clicking a gun near my head.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to CNN more than two years later, Chudynovych was still struggling to recover from the ordeal. He said the interrogators were pressuring him into cooperating and revealing the details of Ukrainian resistance groups in Kherson, threatening his wife and children.\n\n\u201cThey gave me a baton to touch and said that they were going to shove this baton in my a***. When they pressed it against my anus and started to push it in, one of them said: \u2018Will you sign a document that you agree to work for us?\u2019\u201d he told CNN.\n\nA few days after he was released, Chudynovych managed to escape from Kherson to Bashtanka, a town still under Ukrainian control, where he told officials he was forced to sign a document under pressure.\n\nThe Kherson Prosecutor\u2019s Office confirmed Chudynovych\u2019s account of what happened to CNN, saying he is officially considered a victim of Russian torture.\n\n\u2018American spies\u2019\n\nMoscow has been cracking down on all non-Russian churches in occupied Ukraine, but Protestant and Evangelical groups have often been among the first to be banned. Many have links with American congregations and US-based Ukrainian and Russian diaspora.\n\nBodyu, who is a dual citizen of Ukraine and the United States, said Russia\u2019s persecution of Protestants and Evangelicals goes way back.\n\n\u201cIf you had contact with churches outside of Soviet Union, you were (considered) a spy. That\u2019s what they believe and there is no point in trying to explain that it\u2019s not that way,\u201d he told CNN, adding that when he denied being a spy, the FSB officials who interrogated him suggested the US was taking advantage of him without his knowledge.\n\nThe persecution of Evangelical Protestants has hit close to home for some in the US \u2013 including House Speaker Mike Johnson, himself an Evangelical, who was successfully lobbied by, among others, Evangelical groups over US funding for Ukraine.\n\nReverend Mykhailo Brytsyn, head of the Grace Church, once a 600-strong Evangelical congregation in Melitopol, told CNN he was also accused of working for the US when detained by Russian officials.\n\n\u201cThey said we were like cancer, they called us sectarians and said we were all American spies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey wanted us to take their side. They were preparing for a referendum (on joining Russia) and they tried to blackmail us. They said we would be allowed to continue as a church if we took their side. And we said no,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen Brytsyn refused, the Russian authorities closed the church down and gave him a warning: leave Melitopol or be taken away by force to the occupied capital city of Donetsk region.\n\nIhor Ivashchuk, who was a pastor at the Evangelical Grace Church in Melitopol with Mykhailo Brystsyn, told CNN he was also accused by Russian authorities of being an American spy. Ivana Kottasova/CNN\n\nNo more prayers\n\nReligious Ukrainians living under Russian occupation are facing the same choice as faith leaders: switch allegiance and join one of the Russian-approved churches, leave or go underground.\n\nOne man living in an occupied area of Ukraine told CNN he and others from his Evangelical church were determined to keep praying together after Russian troops invaded their city.\n\nWhen the Russians took over their building, the congregation moved elsewhere, he said. When the occupying authorities began to impose restrictions on sermons, they started a home prayer group. \u201cWe prayed for Ukraine at the group meetings. And then the prayer leader was arrested,\u201d he said. \u201cSo now there are no more prayers like that.\u201d\n\nCNN spoke with the man through his pastor, who was forced to leave the city. CNN is not publishing the man\u2019s name or naming his city because of the dangers of speaking out. The whereabouts of the prayer group\u2019s leader are still unknown, the pastor said. Several priests and other religious leaders who have stayed in occupied areas and continued preaching have been sentenced to years in prison by Russian authorities.\n\nGrace Church in Melitopol was allowed to continue holding services for months after the occupation. But over the summer of 2022, churches in the city started being shut down and priests detained.\n\nThe Grace Church in Melitopol before and after Russian occupation of the city. Russian-installed officials turned the church into an administrative building, removing its cross and painting portraits of Russian soldiers on the fa\u00e7ade. Mykhailo Brytsyn\n\nIhor Ivashchuk, who was a pastor at Grace Church in Melitopol with Brystsyn, was conducting a Sunday service on September 11, 2022, when some 15 to 20 armed and masked people came in and ushered everyone into the back of the church. He said they searched the building and fingerprinted about 200 people, including many elderly parishioners.\n\nWhile most people were let go, Ivashchuk said he was held for many hours, watching helplessly as the masked men ransacked the church.\n\n\u201cThey kept asking me who controls us, they couldn\u2019t understand that a church can be independent,\u201d Ivashchuk told CNN in an interview in Kyiv. \u201cThey kept saying we are working for the Americans, that the Americans give us money and brainwash us and pay us to oppose Russia.\u201d\n\nThe Grace Church, which was built by the congregation more than a century ago, was seized and turned into an administrative center by the Russian-installed authorities.\n\nBoth Brytsyn and Ivashchuk were forced to leave the city. Many of their parishioners have also left and are now dotted around Ukraine and the world. Those who remain worship in secret, only occasionally keeping in touch. It\u2019s too dangerous for them to even try to log into the regular prayer meetings Brytsyn and Ivashchuk hold online.\n\nPastor Ihor Ivashchuk, who was forced by Russian authorities into exile from Melitopol, hosts a home prayer group in his flat in Kyiv. Ivana Kottasova/CNN\n\nIvashchuk and his family are now living in a small flat in a Kyiv suburb, where he holds regular prayer meetings for the church members who also found refuge there, huddled around a dining table adorned with ceremonial wine and bread for communion.\n\n\u201cI could not imagine it would be possible to keep going. But you can have a church anywhere \u2013 even if it\u2019s a bit improvised,\u201d the pastor said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Katharina Krebs and Victoria Butenko contributed reporting."

Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The death toll in Gaza has been the source of uncertainty, speculation and heated debate. Since Israel unleashed its war machine on the territory from which militant group Hamas launched its lethal strike of Oct. 7, 2023, we have relied upon data provided by Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, whose work counting the dead in previous rounds of conflict was seen as accurate, although it doesn\u2019t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Most humanitarian organizations, the United Nations itself and Israeli-friendly governments, including the Biden administration, have broadly accepted the publicized data as the best measure of what has unfolded over the past 14 months.\n\nIsraeli officials and their supporters abroad scoff at the reported casualty figures in Gaza as the inflated product of Hamas propagandists. They blame Hamas for embedding itself in Gaza\u2019s densely packed neighborhoods. But the undeniable devastation of Gaza and hundreds of documented mass casualty events tell a different story \u2014 one that myriad watchdog groups and human rights organizations are trying to flesh out in greater detail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Airwars, a British-based nonprofit that charts civilian casualties in 21st-century conflicts, put out a report that examined in granular detail the first 25 days of the war in October 2023. It concluded that, in that time period, \u201ccivilian harm in Gaza occurred on a scale unmatched by any conflict\u201d the organization has tracked, which includes the U.S.-led bombing campaigns of the Islamic State-held cities of Mosul and Raqqa.\n\nThe organization said Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza \u201cis incomparable with any 21st century air campaign\u201d and \u201cby far the most intense, destructive, and fatal conflict\u201d it has tracked. In October 2023 alone, Airwars reported, 5,139 civilians were killed in Israeli strikes, 1,900 of them children. The figure is nearly seven times higher than the monthly toll for slain children in any other conflict the group\u2019s researchers have monitored. Out of 606 incidents of civilian harm during October 2023 that Airwars has studied so far, just 26 had clear public evidence of the death of at least one confirmed Palestinian militant. Those 606 are less than a tenth of the more than 7,000 such incidents its researchers have monitored that month.\n\nThe organization is known for its thorough, painstaking approach. Its referrals prompted more than 70 percent of the Pentagon\u2019s investigations into incidents of civilian harm during the U.S.-led air campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the case of Gaza, Airwars spent months combing through open-source data on casualties, including the Palestinian national ID numbers of the victims, social media notices, news reports and other information, to build a dataset regarding each casualty incident. The data for October 2023 is available, but it\u2019s continuing the work for the subsequent months of the war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe picture that may emerge, the organization said, is grim. \u201cWhile expecting the overall trends to remain, magnitudes of difference \u2014 where measures of civilian harm in Gaza outpace those from previously documented conflicts \u2014 are expected to grow,\u201d Airwars noted in its report.\n\nThe violence has hardly let up. Even as Israel carried out a widespread bombing campaign across Syria and expanded its hold over the contested Golan Heights, it maintained its drumbeat of strikes on Gaza. According to local health authorities, there were five Israeli attacks over the weekend that, collectively, killed at least 46 people. Since October, Israeli operations aimed at uprooting cells of Hamas fighters have further pounded northern areas of the Gaza Strip, flattening neighborhoods and displacing the population that remains multiple times. Rights groups warn of the dire threats facing everyone trapped in the territory as the cold of winter deepens.\n\nHamas endures despite an Israeli campaign in Gaza that has forced some 2 million people from their homes and destroyed most of the territory\u2019s civilian infrastructure, including bakeries, water plants and hospitals. Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries and organized criminal looting have accelerated a hunger crisis, as my colleagues reported, leaving some areas on the brink of famine. The scale of the devastation, the pattern of strikes and the rhetoric of many Israeli politicians all fed into Amnesty International\u2019s declaration earlier this month that Israel had committed \u2014 and was committing \u2014 acts of genocide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsraeli authorities rejected the human rights group\u2019s findings. \u201cThe claims presented in this report are entirely baseless,\u201d the Israeli military said in a statement to The Washington Post. The military said it was \u201cactively working to dismantle Hamas\u2019 military infrastructure while adhering to its obligations under international law.\u201d\n\nThose claims have been challenged in many instances, including through ongoing cases against Israel and its leaders at the International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court. The incoming Trump administration appears set to shield Israel from further international censure \u2014 following, in many ways, in the footsteps of its predecessor.\n\nThe Biden administration received nearly 500 reports alleging that Israel used U.S.-supplied weapons for attacks that caused unnecessary harm to civilians in the Gaza Strip, but it has failed to comply with its own policies requiring swift investigations of such claims, my colleagues reported in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re ignoring evidence of widespread civilian harm and atrocities to maintain a policy of virtually unconditional weapons transfers to the [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu government,\u201d John Ramming Chappell, a legal and policy adviser who focuses on U.S. security assistance and arms sales at the Center for Civilians in Conflict, told my colleagues."

Earlier in the day, an Israeli airstrike also targeted radars in Deir al-Zour\u2019s military airport in the country\u2019s east, the Observatory said.\n\nThe \u201csuccessive strikes\u201d along the Syrian coast \u2014 home to Russian naval bases \u2014 amounted to \u201cthe most violent strikes in the area\u201d since 2012, according to the Observatory. It said there were 18 airstrikes, which were particularly powerful because they were consecutive and detonated missiles in warehouses, leading to secondary explosions.\n\nThe Israeli military declined to comment on the strikes. Israeli officials have previously said that the campaign in Syria is an effort to keep military equipment out of the hands of \u201cextremists,\u201d after an alliance of rebel groups ousted the Assad regime earlier this month. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the latest strikes, the Observatory said."

Interest rate cuts, with more eyed on the horizon will be helping with confidence,\n\n'The stability the new government has brought is also helping, after years of political uncertainty in the UK. But the US market, given its performance over the past year is still a tough act to follow.'"

            "article_content": "The environmental and social impact assessments for the Rogun project are outdated and do not consider the advancements in renewable energy technologies or the increased risks of climate change.\n\nBuilding the Rogun Dam to its maximum height would be an economic and environmental disaster for Tajikistan and the region.\n\nBuilding the Rogun Dam in Tajikistan to its maximum projected height and specifications would be an economic disaster for Central Asia\u2019s poorest nation, and an environmental nightmare for the entire region, according to a newly published expert report. The advent of new technologies for electricity generation means that Tajikistan\u2019s already decades-old mega project would be outdated before it became fully operational.\n\nThe report, compiled by the Kazakhstan-based environmental organization Rivers Without Boundaries, is being distributed shortly before a World Bank Board of Directors meeting, scheduled for December 17, is due to discuss financing options for the Rogun project, the costs of which have spiraled upward in recent years. Current projections put the price tag of completing the dam at its projected height of 335 meters at $6.4 billion.\n\nThe project was first conceived in the 1970s and revived by the Tajik government in 2016. Work has continued on the dam sporadically since then.\n\nExperts assembled by Rivers Without Boundaries compiled data on eight different scenarios for achieving the Rogun project\u2019s intended goal of producing enough electricity to both meet the country\u2019s domestic needs and generate revenue via the export of power. The results contained in the report suggest that a mix of renewable power generation, along with the completion of a significantly smaller Rogun Dam, would be the optimal solution.\n\n\u201cOur preliminary calculations of alternative scenarios for project implementation show the combination of solar generation development with the completion of Rogun HPP with a smaller dam may make it possible to fully cover the winter energy deficit in Tajikistan by 2030-2031,\u201d the report states. The \u201cdiversification of energy sources within the unified energy system of the country will also significantly reduce climate change risks for the energy sector and the economy.\u201d\n\nThe environmental and social impact assessments that officials are relying on for the Rogun project are outdated, relying on over decade-old data, according to the report. Since then, there have been major advances in wind and solar power generation technologies, and the risks posed by global warming in Central Asia have risen. \u201cOne of the recurrent planning mistakes made each time this project has been revived and reviewed is the lack of assessment of alternative solutions to the project's challenges,\u201d the report states.\n\nWhen completed the 335-meter-tall dam would have an annual power-generating capacity of 3,600 megawatts, roughly equivalent to the output of three nuclear plants. But by the time the facility can reach full generating capacity, the cost of its electricity would be uncompetitive compared to renewable sources, the report asserted. The unit cost of building Rogun is up to four times higher than that of a solar power plant (SPP).\n\n\u201cThe cost of Rogun's electricity will be more expensive than that produced by solar photovoltaics (SPP) and wind (WPP) power plants. If Tajikistan intends to become an electricity exporter to its neighbors, it needs to develop SPP and WPP,\u201d the report adds.\n\nA new environmental impact study, along with a comprehensive regional water-usage framework, is needed, before any additional financing for Rogun is allocated, Rivers Without Boundaries argues. Environmentalists say the alteration of the water flows of the Vaksh and Amu Darya rivers caused by Rogun construction and operation to date already has degraded regional ecosystems, and \u201cworsened conditions for irrigation in dry years.\u201d\n\nRogun would also be a potent source of greenhouse gasses at a time when Central Asia is straining to curtail emissions as part of an effort to slow global warming. The draft environmental impact assessment currently in use shows that Rogun will \u201cstill have a large carbon footprint,\u201d the report states. \u201c The completion of the Rogun HPP with the highest dam [335-meter level] will not only fail to result in rapid decarbonization of Central Asian energy systems, but rather, on the contrary, will slow down this process.\u201d\n\nBy Eurasianet.org\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com"

A unique discovery that not only teaches us more about our past, but also shows how unique the story of Roman Heerlen is for the Netherlands,\" Clemens wrote.\n\nAdvert\n\nAfter analysing the gravesite, researchers deduced that Heerlen's first settlement would have been around the Augustan era from around 0 to 20 AD.\n\nThis gravesite was discovered in the midst of excavations at Raadhuisplein, the town square in Heerlen, near a couple of historical roads in Via Belgica and Via Traiana.\n\nIt was found to be an important location in the middle of a Roman settlement named Coriovallum, according to archaeologists.\n\nCariovallum was known for its Roman bathhouse, which is also the oldest stone building in the whole country, built in approximately 40AD.\n\nAdvert\n\nNot only that, but the building also had a restaurant and library, which points towards the area being a multi-purpose building and a place of meeting in Roman times. They really were ahead of their time, weren't they?\n\nA bronze skin scraper, four plates and a bowl were found in the grave with Flaccus (Municipality of Heerlen)\n\nArchaeologists further explained that their findings would give us some new insights into the history of the city, adding: \u201cNever before have we found a Roman grave from this period with a name.\u201d\n\nAs well as Flaccus, they found a bronze skin scraper, four plates and a bowl in the grave, managing to trace the pottery back to ancient Italy, confirming their suspicions that he was a Roman soldier.\n\nAdvert\n\nIn the past, digs in the area have uncovered nothing more than pottery shreds, not proving the presence of a settlement as these items could have been left behind during travel.\n\nFlaccus' grave gave researchers eye-opening evidence that there was a Roman presence in the region, as they further explained: \u201cIt is a unique find because it is not only the oldest Roman grave in Heerlen but also because no name was known there before.\u201d"

I actually can't believe it,\" she said in the video. \"Apparently, the first two letters on your number plate - so, like, my old car was MV - mean that car was registered in Manchester.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"They all have different codes, so it goes from MA to M- whatever, and that's all from Manchester.\"\n\nCourtney went on to explain: \"The first two letters actually mean something. You've got where the car was registered, the year it was registered, and then just a random sequence. I'm literally mind blown.\"\n\nHer video has since sparked a flurry of comments, with other people either sharing her amazement or confessing they had no idea about the system themselves.\n\nOne user wrote: \"How did I not know this? Mind blown too,\" while another joked: \"I've been driving for years, and this just made me feel like I missed an entire class on life.\"\n\nWhat do UK number plates actually mean?\n\nIf you've ever wondered about the seemingly random assortment of characters on UK number plates, Jon Kirkbright, the sales director of Private Number Plates, broke it down.\n\nAdvert\n\nCourtney shared her discover with TikTok (TikTok/@courtneywrightxxx)\n\nSpeaking to Diamond Advanced Motorists last year, Jon said: \"To the untrained eye, number plates may look like a random combination of letters and numbers.\n\n\"While many people are aware that the numbers indicate the year the car was made and registered, fewer people realise that the letters better them serve as 'regional identifiers.' These refer to the DVLA office where the car was registered.\"\n\nFor instance, plates beginning with MV, MA, or MB originate from the Manchester and Merseyside region, LA, LB, LV, etc., are assigned to London and BA, BB and BC indicate registration in Birmingham.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"This may be why your number plates start with the same letters if you buy more than one car from the same dealership - it's not just a coincidence,\" Jon added.\n\nWhat are the rules around private plates?\n\nFor those with private plates, the rules are a little stricter. Jon highlighted that while it's legal to make a car seem older using a dateless plate, it's illegal to make it look newer.\n\nEach car's number plate are assigned to where the car was registered (Getty stock image)\n\nAdvert\n\n\"For example, you cannot put an '11' number plate on a car registered in 2007,\" he said. \"It is an offence to misrepresent the registration in any way.\"\n\nThose wanting to hide the age of their car often opt for dateless plates, which allow for complete customisation while avoiding this issue.\n\nIf you're curious about your own car's registration, you can find a full list of regional number plate identifiers online - and join the ranks of those whose minds have been well and truly blown by the hidden meaning behind UK plates."

Some of them can even move into the ocean, and then back up to the air. Which is called \u2018transmedium travel.\u2019 A very hard thing to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuing, DeLonge compared the episode to UFO sightings described in a 1965 document from the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s a repeat of exactly what happened in the \u201860s,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to DeLonge \u2014 who co-founded the company, To the Stars, in 2017 to promote UFO-related theories \u2014 UFOs have a pattern of \u201cmimicking\u201d other aircraft. \u201cThis even happened more recently in situations at Skinwalker Ranch years ago when it was being studied [by] the US Gov under BAAS and AATIP,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd again, also decades ago in the \u201860s. It\u2019s all something to consider.\u201d\n\nDeLonge then wrote, \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t have all the facts yet, we do know that UFOs play with \u2018mimicry\u2019 and that has been known for quite some time. Why? To get us to notice them without a major freak out?\u201d\n\nDeLonge doesn\u2019t claim to have the answers to those questions, but he did conclude with a message to any possible spectators watching from UFOs: \u201cWell, we are noticing nonetheless.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead DeLonge\u2019s full post below.\n\nDeLonge\u2019s UFO enthusiasm has made headlines plenty of time in the past, perhaps most prominently in 2020 when the Pentagon published videos that were previously shared by To the Stars. \u201cWe plan on pursuing the technology, finding more answers and telling the stories,\u201d he said in a statement at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Blink-182 wrapped their massive reunion tour with a final show in Mexico City last month. Up next, they\u2019re scheduled to headline When We Were Young 2025 (get tickets here).\n\nBlink-182\u2019s Tom DeLonge Has a Theory on the New Jersey Drones: They\u2019re UFOs\n\nJo Vito\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPopular Posts\n\nSubscribe to Consequence\u2019s email digest and get the latest breaking news in music, film, and television, tour updates, access to exclusive giveaways, and more straight to your inbox."

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve has identified five species new to global science: a gecko (Hemidactylus sp.) marked by brown stripes and white nodules, the Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus), plus three plants \u2014 a globe thistle, a mignonette, and a hogbean. In addition, the Reserve recorded three species new to Saudi Arabia and extended the known global range of 34 more. These outcomes, the result of four years of fieldwork by Saudi and international experts, increase the total number of terrestrial species documented in the Reserve to 791. Although the Reserve covers only 1% of the Kingdom's terrestrial area, it is home to more than half of Saudi Arabia's terrestrial species, reinforcing its role as a vital refuge for biodiversity in a changing climate.\n\nNewly discovered gecko Hemidactylus sp, in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve\n\nAndrew Zaloumis, CEO of the Reserve, emphasized the global significance of these findings, stating: \"At a moment in time when the IUCN has warned that 28% of species globally are now at risk of extinction these discoveries are significant. They reaffirm the importance of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve as a bioclimatic refugia, particularly as climate change is increasingly impacting the customary habitats of many of these species. Testament to this is the Reserve's iconic Wadi Al-Disah, with its 200+ species, a key site on the UNESCO World Heritage Bioclimatic Refugia of Western Arabia tentative list. None of this would have been possible without the strong collaboration of natural scientists from the Kingdom and 14 other countries with the Reserve over the last 4 years to conduct multi-season field surveys.\"\n\nAmong the five species new to science are two reptiles and three plants, each with unique ecological and cultural significance. The gecko (Hemidactylus sp.), currently undergoing DNA analysis, features striking brown horizontal stripes from neck to tail and white nodules along its back. This gecko preys on small invertebrates like mosquitoes, playing an essential role in pest control within desert ecosystems. The Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus) is a small, non-venomous species that is bright red with a distinctive black collar.\n\nThe three new plants to science are firstly the globe thistle (Echinops sp. aff. glaberrimus) from the Asteraceae family. It produces vibrant blooms that support pollinators and promote ecosystem health. Historically, it has been used medicinally to treat infections and inflammations. Secondly the mignonette, (Reseda sp. aff. muricata), known for its herbal properties, is often used in teas and perfumery. And thirdly, in contrast, the hogbean (Hyoscyamus sp.) from the Nightshade family has a more complex history, having been used both as a poison and in early anesthesiology and palliative care.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "8. RIKEN and NTT launch world first general-purpose optical quantum computer\n\nRIKEN and NTT launched the world\u2019s first general-purpose optical quantum computer in November. The system operates at nearly room temperature and processes at speeds up to several hundred terahertz.\n\nThe computer uses continuous-variable analog design with time-division multiplexing, where computations occur through quantum teleportation. It can handle approximately 100 continuous quantity inputs. The system is accessible through a cloud service and is designed for materials science, chemistry, and AI applications.\n\nOne major benefit of this approach to quantum computing is that it operates at room temperature. By comparison, superconducting qubits and trapped ion cubits operate at temperatures close to absolute zero. According to Riken, the optical quantum computer is also faster than other quantum computing platforms.\n\n9. D-Wave speeds up processing 25,000 times\n\nAnd in yet another kind of quantum computing \u2014 the analog kind \u2014 D-Wave released the benchmark results for its latest 4,400-plus qubit Advantage2 processor in November, with big performance gains. The system solves materials science problems 25,000 times faster than its previous version, the company claims.\n\nThe new processor doubles qubit coherence time and has improved qubit connectivity, enabling solutions to larger problems.\n\nThe system delivered five times better solutions for high-precision applications and outperformed the previous version in 99% of satisfiability problem tests, the company said. It\u2019s available now through D-Wave\u2019s quantum cloud service.\n\nD-Wave\u2019s qubits can\u2019t be directly compared to those of other companies, however, because it\u2019s not a general-purpose computer but a narrow-purpose analog one.\n\n10. Google uses AI to improve error correction\n\nWe can expect to see even more progress on error correction next year. One reason? Artificial intelligence.\n\nIn late November, Google announced an AI system that spots errors in quantum computers. This uses the same transformer technology that\u2019s behind large language models and other types of generative AI, but trained specifically on quantum processes.\n\nThe system is too slow to be actually used in real-time to spot errors, Google says, but, as AI technology improves, it could point to an additional way to reduce error rates.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nSo, when will we have working quantum computers?\n\nAnalysts at the Boston Consulting Group say they\u2019ve been disappointed in the lack of recent progress of actual enterprise use cases.\n\n\u201cQuantum computing today provides no tangible advantage over classical computing in either commercial or scientific applications,\u201d Boston Consulting Group researchers wrote in a July report. \u201cThough experts agree that there are clear scientific and commercial problems for which quantum solutions will one day far surpass the classical alternative, the newer technology has yet to demonstrate this advantage at scale.\u201d\n\nAccording to the firm, our current era, that of \u201cnoisy intermediate-scale quantum\u201d will last until 2030.\n\nAt this stage, quantum computers have too few qubits and too many errors to be practically useful, but they can be used to test algorithms and do other preliminary research.\n\nBroad quantum advantage \u2014 where quantum computers can be used to solve problems that traditional computers can\u2019t handle \u2014 will last from approximately 2030 to 2040, according to the Boston Computing Group. At that time, the research firm predicts that end users will see between $80 and $170 billion in total annual value creations.\n\nIn 2040, according to the research firm, we\u2019ll enter the era of full-scale fault tolerance, and end users will see between $450 and $850 billion of value creation per year. This is when errors are reduced to the point that quantum computers can be scaled up to handle pretty much anything thrown at them.\n\nSome quantum computing companies expect to get there even faster. For example, IBM\u2019s quantum roadmap has the company delivering a fully error-corrected system in 2029. It expects to have a quantum computer with over 2,000 error-corrected qubits \u2014 or logical qubits \u2014 after 2033.\n\nIt takes many physical qubits to create one error-corrected logical qubit, so IBM expects to have a 100,000-qubit computer by then, capable of running 1 billion gates.\n\nIBM is the company to watch, says Gartner\u2019s Dekate. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that IBM is leading,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re innovating at every layer of the stack. But it is early days.\u201d Achieving workable quantum computers is a marathon, he says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the first five minutes.\u201d\n\nWhoever is ahead today might not necessarily win the race, he says. \u201cEnterprises should not fall into the trap of trying to figure out who\u2019s ahead and who\u2019s behind \u2014 that will lead enterprises to make bad decisions, because the leaderboard will change quite dramatically.\u201d\n\nHe suggests that companies looking to take the lead in finding ways to take advantage of quantum computing should partner with multiple vendors and explore different pathways. And, instead of focusing on finding short-term investment returns, they should instead think about skills development, building capabilities, investigating use cases, and preparing for disruptions."

            "article_content": "Following historian and philosopher Hanna Arendt, there is the belief that the public should assert their needs and interests in scientific endeavors.1 But, before the public can weigh in, someone must fully inform them of the issue involved. Once citizens understand a problem, they can ensure, through their political representatives, that the science aligns with their demands and does not go off on its own. For example, once Americans understood the gravity, they clearly articulated that they would not allow science to create human beings in a laboratory or have computers governing the world.\n\nSource: CC-BY-SA-3.0\n\nIn contrast, modern medicine illustrates what happens when the public lacks information and has little input: educators and researchers go on their own\u2014and continue to do so in the face of abject failure. Here is one example in medicine, US citizens do not know how frightful their mental health care is, that medicine refuses to adopt the teaching that would cure it, or that they can direct their politicians to require that change.\n\nWhat do Americans need to know to activate and direct change?\n\n1. Although mental illness is the most common health condition in the US (nearly 100 million Americans in any one year), most people do not know that only 25 percent of patients receive any care, most of which does not meet standards. Compare this to 70 percent of physical disease patients receiving care of high quality. Mistakenly, some uninformed Americans even assume mental health care matches medical care.\n\n2. Few realize that compromised mental health care results from two easily remediable medical derelictions: a) medicine fails to train enough mental health professionals (psychiatrists and psychologists each conduct only 12 percent of care); and b) it provides almost no training for the primary care clinicians who, by default, conduct over 75 percent of mental health care; their lack of training explains why most mental health care is substandard. Shockingly, educators devote only 2 percent of physicians\u2019 training to mental health care. These facts identify the simple but surprisingly overlooked solution to the mental health crisis: train more mental health professionals and train the medical doctors who provide most of the care.\n\n3. Almost no one understands why medicine would resist such obvious solutions. The \u201cmind-body split\u201d philosophy or theory developed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries caused this blind spot. In a political compromise, church and science leaders of the scientific revolution agreed to the split: the mind, soul, and spirit went together and were the church\u2019s province alone. Medicine could only consider the physical body and its diseases from the neck down. That made mental disorders and other mind issues, such as emotions, off base for medicine. Although mental health care became medicine\u2019s responsibility in the 1800s, physicians have never deviated from their isolated focus on the physical body and its diseases. Only a small minority of clinicians ever showed any interest in mental health, and the tiny field of psychiatry formed around them; this was often disdained and dismissed by the majority culture. Sadly, medical education has never exhibited an interest in mental illness training for medical students or producing enough residencies to train psychiatrists. On the other hand, medicine has not failed. The mind-body split led to massive physical healthcare improvements in the last century when life survival doubled from 40 years to 80 years.\n\nSource: CC-BY-2.5\n\nNevertheless, the exclusion of a patient's psychological and social life now renders the mind-body split obsolete. It worked primarily for the acute physical and surgical illnesses that medicine has now cured or controlled for the most part (for example, tuberculosis, pneumonia, diarrhea, diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough; and ether anesthesia). But modern medicine\u2019s patient population has changed\u2014mental illnesses and chronic physical diseases are the most common conditions practitioners face.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s obvious why eschewing the mind shortchanges mental illnesses, almost no one recognizes it is also harming chronic disease care. Most chronic physical disorders are caused by the very psychological and social factors excluded by medical education\u2014lifestyle issues such as cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, overeating and overweight, drug addiction, and stress. Doctors must incorporate lifestyle issues into treatment to improve the underlying physical disease, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, yet they are not taught how to do this. More incriminating, medicine could prevent some 80 percent of heart disease and diabetes and 40 percent of cancers by addressing lifestyle factors. But it waits for cancer and heart disease to occur and then treats the problem.\n\n4. Although most people think medical education and research are scientifically based, the public will no doubt be aghast to learn that it does not follow modern scientific principles. Among all sciences, only medicine does not adhere to modern scientific theory: a systems view of life\u2014where physicians and other scientists must consider all parts of a problem and their interactions.2 Medicine\u2019s isolated disease focus omits the equally important psychological and social parts of its patients. More disturbing, medicine ignores the systems approach proposed for it in the 1970s, the biopsychosocial model. Demonstrably superior and research-based, the model links the patient\u2019s physical disease (biological) features with their psychological and social parts, thus integrating mental health care with medical care. Actively teaching the model would guarantee that the quality of mental health care matched physical disease care. Yet four centuries of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d by a now effete theoretical concept has left physicians immune to recognizing its profound shortcomings.\n\nExactly how do we initiate change? Inform the public. Typically, after citizens are informed and angry, they direct their politicians to confront refractory institutions. People knew little, for example, about the risks of automobiles and chemical pollutants. Then came Unsafe at Any Speed by Ralph Nader3 and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson.4 These books made millions of Americans aware that seat belts saved lives and that we had poisonous DDT in our drinking water\u2014but that the auto and chemical industries refused to install seat belts and remove DDT for financial reasons. An irate US population insisted on change. That\u2019s why you have seat belts and clean water today. And a model for change\u2014informing the public."
