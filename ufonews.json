            "article_content": "On the night of August 10, 2022, five pilots on two separate commercial airline flights were wholly convinced they\u2019d documented proof of an Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP) over the Pacific Ocean. Pilots from both flights reported seeing odd lights zipping through the sky\u2014but the single incident they all witnessed turned out to be Starlink telecommunications satellites.\n\nIn recent years, pilots\u2014as well as the public\u2014have mistakenly identified these low-Earth orbit satellites as UAPs. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of 69 reports just from January 23\u2013April 27, 2023 that identify \u201cUFO-UAP,\u201d and according to one paper , more than a third of them could be Starlink satellites. Unfortunately, such mysterious sightings lead to pilot confusion and potential safety consequences because of the distraction and extra chatter about them over the airwaves.\n\nThe core issue with pilots misidentifying satellites as UAPs stems from the fact that pilots cannot access real-time data about satellite movements, leaving them unprepared to recognize strange lights in the sky. These satellites may appear to move in unexpected ways, based on their orientation, and they may also appear and disappear, since their solar arrays reflect sunlight at different angles when deployed, relative to the pilot\u2019s position in flight.\n\nStarlink satellites orbit about 342 miles above Earth, according to Starlink\u2019s website, and that places them lower than most other satellites, making them visible to our eyes as spots of light, no magnification needed. More than 6,000 Starlink satellites are currently circling Earth, and the SpaceX-owned company aims to eventually have 42,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit, which means pilots will need to have surefire methods for identifying them.\n\n\n\nGetty Images The passage of Starlink satellites is seen in the sky over southern Poland on November 1, 2024.\n\nFour scientists want to fill the information gap in this type of situation to prevent unnecessary aviation risk. Led by mechanical engineer Douglas J. Buettner of the University of Utah, the team devised a method to simulate the exact locations of satellites, and they proposed plans that would provide pilots with the information they need to quickly identify satellites. Their paper describing this work was accepted at the 2024 International Academy of Astronautics Conference on Space Situational Awareness (ICSSA).\n\nTo shed some light on what the five pilots saw, the scientists conducted an \u201castrometric analysis\u201d of their reports, using two cell phone photos and a video the pilots had taken of \u201can unrecognized and possibly anomalous phenomenon,\u201d according to the paper. To corroborate the data, researchers looked up Starlink\u2019s records, noting that the visual line the satellites created in the sky\u2014called a \u201ctrain\u201d of satellites\u2014launched that same day. The team also used data from the flight, including photographs taken in the cockpit. Using these pieces of information and an orbital mechanics software tool, they were able to reconstruct the August 10 cockpit view. It showed Starlink satellites matching both the time and place of the sighting.\n\nTheir analysis used a technique called \u201cray-traced rendering\u201d of the view from the pilots\u2019 cockpit, which provided a more visual simulation of exactly where the pilots saw the satellites through their cockpit windows, according to the paper. The simulation experiments indicated that the satellites\u2019 solar arrays must have been deployed, likely making them glint brightly enough for the pilots in both aircraft to notice them. \u201cIn the implementation of our approach, we were able to closely match the apparent speed in degrees per second traveled by the object between the two photographs taken by one of the pilots,\u201d the scientists wrote.\n\nThe team hopes that their work demonstrates a plan that could plausibly \u201cwarn aviators and the public about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations,\u201d and therefore support aviation safety, they wrote. In the future, it\u2019s worth studying how the deployment of a satellite\u2014as well as its surface materials\u2014affects the way it reflects sunlight, the paper adds. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said on X that the satellite orientation could be adjusted to minimize solar reflection during astronomical experiments, though the team\u2019s paper does not specifically address this possibility.\n\nThe authors do suggest various procedures and technologies that aircraft could deploy to support accurate UAP identification. For example, pilots should be allowed to \u201croutinely provide photographic evidence from either an automated system when they are busy with safety critical aircraft operations, or using cell phones when they are not allowed,\u201d to greatly improve UAP analysis.\n\nSatellite operators should also provide information about satellite movements\u2014such as orientation, orbit location, and deployment timelines\u2014to support more accurate and detailed models, the scientists write. Finally, they suggest a way for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reduce in-flight risks due to pilots trying to determine the source of a UAP. Air traffic controllers could have access to a satellite-modeling system that would enable them to anticipate satellite sightings and alert the pilots when necessary. \u201cWe envision this as a collaborative effort between the satellite\u2019s owners (in this case SpaceX/Starlink), the FAA, NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Space Force,\u201d the authors note.\n\nAs for people on the ground, anyone can find Starlink in the sky. Look up on a clear, dark night, and if you see a white light or \u201ctrain\u201d of lights moving across the sky, go to FindStarlink.com. You can search for your time and location and determine if what you see is indeed Starlink satellites."

            "article_content": "If you gotta go fast, you probably don't want to be a stubby-legged spearman who climbs every ladder like a geriatric walrus. Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.\n\nBarbuta itself was completed in 4 minutes 55 seconds by player \"GrayGooGlitch\". It's only 11 seconds short of the fastest existing run. The unrepentantly obscure game is full of old-school trickery, like specific pools of toxic slime that won't hurt you, walls that secretly lack collision, and spike pitfalls with invisible bridges. But it's the randomly fluttering bats that give players the most trouble, as they did here just moments into the run.\n\nBut the UFO 50 marathon was also a team effort. Three other players zipped through their own game choices in the allotted time, swapping the controller just like in the good old days of losing a life to a hateful chicken. The next game was Rakshasa, a tough-as-old-boots action game with lots of upsetting frogs. The runner polished it off in 8 minutes and 22 seconds. Then came Night Manor, a point and click horror game with a ton of classical item puzzling but with a killer that follows you through the rooms and will come hunting you if you make noise by doing certain actions like activating a jukebox. They got through that in 6 minutes 20 seconds.\n\nFinally, it was Warptank, a kind of anti-platformer about a nippy space tank that can't jump but can teleblorp to the surface immediately above it. When I played it for our UFO 50 review, each screen was both a fight with the pixel enemies and a puzzle to figure out. When runner \"SpootyBiscuit\" plays, he turns it into a rhythmic waltz of warping, sparking off forty-five degree angles and blasting troublesome worms with ease. It was the toughest game to get through, with a time of 28 minutes 27 seconds.\n\nOverall, it's a nifty showcase of the retro-styled games contained within UFO 50, all of which contain some twist inspired by modern game design. Awesome Games Done Quick began at the weekend and runs until this Sunday. Other recent speedruns include a blast through Rain World: Downpour, but we're still waiting on the player who intends to beat Elden Ring bosses with nothing but his saxophone and a jazzy attitude. That's happening on Thursday. I look forward to it."

            "article_content": "George Clinton\u2019s real UFO encounters: \u201cIf you ain\u2019t got no booty, what do you shake?\u201d\n\nPeople weren\u2019t meant to be this informed all the time. It\u2019s quite literally not natural for us to know this much information and have such a big-picture view of the world. For most of us, we have to focus on what we ourselves can change for the sake of our own mental health. Having too much of a big-picture view of the world will only stress us out. That said, we could go the George Clinton way, take the big picture to such a degree that we all become one, and see just how ludicrous it is to care about our petty differences.\n\nClinton sums this up best in an interview with Rolling Stone. When asked about white artists performing Black music, he is fairly supportive of the idea: \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to learn from each other, blend from each other, and it moves around like that.\u201d So far, so down to earth. Suddenly, that figurative statement becomes literal in the funniest way possible.\n\nAdding, \u201cWe gonna be dealing with aliens. You think Black and white gonna be a problem? Wait till you start running into motherfuckers with three of four dicks!\u201d\n\nA good point well made, George. You see, Clinton didn\u2019t just use the whole sci-fi/afrofuturism vibe of Parliament/Funkadelic as an image. He\u2019s all in on the idea of life beyond the stars because, if you ask him about it, he\u2019s met them in person.\n\nHe goes on to talk about an alien encounter he had with bass icon Bootsy Collins. Right from the off, he answers the question that all of us would have and says, \u201cWe weren\u2019t high.\u201d He says the two of them were driving together after a morning fishing trip, and at around midday, \u201cA light hit the car, and a substance like mercury out of the thermometer rolled up the side of the car.\u201d\n\nIn a further interview with the YouTube channel Nowness, he expanded on what happened next: \u201cWe just drove up to my house\u2026 my daughter came outside and said to us, \u2018Y\u2019all look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u2019\u201d Then it gets really weird. Years later, he recalled that, shortly after they got back, his daughter \u201cwas talking about going to bed. We\u2019d (gone fishing) around 9:30 or 10 in the morning. Why would she be going to bed? Time was amiss; we\u2019d never even contemplated the time being missing.\u201d\n\nIn the same conversation, he goes on to talk about how rather than these visitors being invaders or colonisers, he likes to believe they\u2019re our ancestors. That they\u2019re a shared part of our DNA that can help bring us together. Which is the core of all this. For all his talk about out-there concepts we\u2019d normally find in sci-fi films, to him, this is about us realising all that we have in common.\n\nIt makes no sense to discuss the concept of \u2018white music\u2019 and \u2018Black music\u2019 when it should be all about how much we, as humans, can connect with each other. It\u2019s a charming thought, one put best later in the same interview. When asked what he\u2019d like to say to these aliens if given the chance, he says he\u2019d like to ask, \u201cHow do y\u2019all dance? If you ain\u2019t got no booty, what do you shake?\u201d\n\nReal talk, it\u2019s a question we could do a whole lot of good by asking each other first."

They, and others, have been visiting the local hot spots of haunted encounters in the area. After investigating, which usually consists of staying a night in the so-called \"haunted houses\" Sanders then videos of the experience onto his Youtube channel, which can be found through the social media handle: CLS Paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I have a friend who lives out here and I came out here to visit him. I actually drove from Arizona and he asked me, because he watches my show, if I wanted to do a couple ghost hunts out here. I was sure that Lockport was rich and full of history, so we did some research and talked to some people and we've done quite a few places,\" Sanders said.\n\nSo far Sander's visited such spots like Marjim Manor, Van Horn Mansion, Cold Springs Cemetery, Dunkirk Lighthouse and Stooges, the old City Hall.\n\nSanders said he has plans to visit even more ghostly sites, including Graestone Manor in Gasport.\n\nWhile the ghosts in Lockport seem more \"intrigued\" by him than \"aggressive\" Sanders said that was fine with him. He's still testing new ground in the world of the paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Some of these places I've done have never been investigated by anybody before. I think they're more intrigued here than aggressive, unlike the places I've been on the West Coast. Those are used to tourism because some of those places out west are mainstream ghost hunting places. Here in Lockport that's not the case,\" he said.\n\nSanders began his own ghost hunting with a curiosity of what's unknown \u2014 the big questions like \"what happens when we die?\" \u2014 as well as a drive to find out for himself. There's millions of ghost hunting shows out there, Sanders said. He wanted to see if it was real.\n\nUsing a wide variety of tools, including \"spirit dice,\" as well as white noise boxes and light-up \"rem pods\" that he buys online, Sanders said that depending on the intelligence of the ghost he's trying to communicate with, different kinds of equipment are used.\n\n\"You usually run into a residual haunting or an intelligent haunting and typically an intelligent haunting can give you intelligent conversation through some of the equipment,\" he said. \"A residual haunting is supposedly a spirit that's almost stuck in a time loop and the spirit is not able to communicate, but we are able to pick up the presence of spirit.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, to even get close to the ghosts, Sanders said he has to get permission. Which can be a strange thing to ask. Such was the case of the old City Hall, now Stooges restaurant.\n\n\"I walked through the front door and I could feel the sensation of some sort of activity there and I walked up to the girls who were working at the front counter \u2014 and sometimes its a very awkward question to ask about the paranormal \u2014but I asked them. I said, 'I have an odd question for you, is this place haunted?' They all started laughing,\" he said.\n\nAs it turns out, after investigating, there was no \"concrete evidence\" of intelligence hauntings in Stooges, but Sanders was able to get evidence of \"something\" in the attic.\n\n\"We set a device upstairs in the attic, in which most of the activity, from the employees and the people that have been in there eating have said they heard. That was the only place I was able to get any concrete evidence of something up there,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther places were a little more spooky, including the house in Cold Springs Cemetery. There, Sanders was unable to get responses, but one of his friends, a camera woman named Jen Craft, was able to get answers from children that were haunting the second floor.\n\n\"She was getting intelligent responses through the devices we were using, confirming there were children upstairs in the Cold Springs Cemetery house,\" Sanders said.\n\nSanders said he intends to stay in the area until May and he and his friends will be checking out everything \"haunted\" in the meantime.\n\n\"I will be discussing with the group on dates, holidays and when they're off (for more ghost hunting trips),\" he said."

            "article_content": "panida wijitpanya/Istockphoto\n\nTop 10 Psychic and Medium Related TV Shows\n\nIs there life after death? TV shows about mediums, who have the intuitive gift of being able to psychically connect with the deceased, have become increasingly popular, as more people open up to the belief that spirits do live on after death.\n\nAs studies have shown communication with those who have passed away is possible, it\u2019s not surprising that more people are seeking mediumship services on popular psychic platforms.\n\nTurn these shows into reality by connecting with your medium through one of these trusted online psychic reading sites.\n\nNew York Live/Youtube\n\n1. The Long Island Medium\n\nThe Long Island Medium stars Theresa Caputo, who is known for walking right up to strangers to pass along messages from departed loved ones. From the grocery store to restaurants, Caputo is attuned to the spiritual realm and in service to bridging the realms of the living and deceased. The spontaneity of her approach leads to candid responses of those who are on the receiving end of the information she is sharing. (Although some of the best online psychic readings can be just as interesting and revealing!)\n\nCaputo has become one of the most well-known reality TV psychics. Due to the popularity of this show, TLC produced 14 seasons between 2011 and 2019. The high-energy and unconventional approach of Caputo makes this show top-notch entertainment.\n\nE! Entertainment/ Youtube\n\n2. Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry\n\nHollywood Medium with Tyler Henry chronicles the readings of clairvoyant medium Tyler Henry Koelewyn, who discovered his intuitive gifts at age 10. He started filming this TV series in 2016, when he was only 19 years old. Tyler Henry\u2019s popularity grew after he appeared on Keeping Up with the Kardashians to do a mediumship reading for the sisters. E! offered Tyler Henry the opportunity to do his own show. It was a hit from the get-go, and ended up running for 4 seasons until 2019.\n\nThe show documents Tyler Henry doing readings for A-List celebrities, such as Carmen Electra, Chad Michael Murray, Megan Fox, Bobby Brown, Kristin Cavallari, and many more. What\u2019s unique about this show is the glimpse it offers into celebrities\u2019 personal lives as they open up about their deceased loved ones.\n\nLifetime/Youtube\n\n3. Seatbelt Psychic\n\nRiffing off popular shows such as Cash Cab and Carpool Karaoke, Seatbelt Psychic features medium Thomas John picking up strangers and relaying messages from departed loved ones. John\u2019s goal is to touch the lives of as many people as possible, trusting he\u2019ll cross paths with the people he\u2019s meant to meet, so this on-the-move show is perfect for his mission.\n\nUnfortunately, it only aired one season in 2018 on Lifetime before being canceled. However, the unscripted nature of the show has gone a long way in convincing skeptics and nonbelievers of the validity of mediumship messages. John\u2019s personal messages are often exactly what his passengers needed to hear to gain clarity and release. If you\u2019re curious whether a loved one on the other side might have something to say to you, the personal face-to-face mediumship readings on Keen are a great way to find out.\n\nA&E/Youtube\n\n4. Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal\n\nChildren tend to have a stronger connection to the other side, hence imaginary friends and seeing things in the closet adults can\u2019t. Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal explores the unique abilities of children with reported psychic ability and connects them with adult psychic mediums to help cultivate their gifts.\n\nThis show ran on A&E for three seasons from 2008 to 2010 and then had a reboot season in 2019. What sets this show apart from others is the special focus on psychically gifted children. Plus, all hosts of the show, Chip Coffey, Chris Flemming, and Kim Russo, are well-known in the paranormal scene. The fourth host, Edy Nathan is a licensed therapist, who ensures the children are integrating and processing their experiences in a healthy way. For anyone who\u2019s ever had to comfort a child who thinks they\u2019ve seen something in the dark, this is a great show to learn from.\n\nChalabala/Istockphoto\n\n5. Pet Psychic\n\nPets quickly become valued family members, and their passing is often just as painful. The Pet Psychic features medium Sonya Fitzpatrick telepathically communicating with animals. From cats and dogs to horses and birds, Fitzpatrick uses her special gift to share messages with pet owners. (And some of the best online psychic readings can also help you connect with your furry friends.)\n\nThis show ran for three seasons from 2002 to 2004 on Animal Planet. What was unique about this show is that she\u2019s not only communicating with deceased pets but also speaking with living animals to help them with emotional trauma and behavioral problems. If this sounds interesting, consider a reading with an expert pet psychic about your own beloved animal.\n\nPrime videos\n\n6. America\u2019s Psychic Challenge\n\nAmerica\u2019s Psychic Challenge is a game show in which four contestants compete to see who is America\u2019s top psychic. In this exciting show, contestants must go through a series of tests to prove their psychic abilities. One challenge is finding a man hidden in the trunk of one car out of 50, while another requires them to correctly match five brides and five grooms.\n\nLifetime only produced one season of this show back in 2007, but there\u2019s also Britain's Psychic Challenge to watch if you like this one. This show is fun and a good start for nonbelievers to see the feats psychics are capable of.\n\nIMDb\n\n7. Rescue Medium\n\nRescue Medium showcases international psychics Jackie Dennison and Christine Hamlett in seasons 1 through 3 and Alison Wynne-Ryder in seasons 4 through 7 as they help to guide lost spirits to the next realm. In the show, the psychics make house calls to ask spirits to leave haunted locations. Plenty of paranormal encounters occur throughout the seasons, including possessions, poltergeists, and ghosts that need to be dealt with.\n\nThis show aired on Canada\u2019s W Network from 2006 to 2011, but different seasons have also aired on WE: Women\u2019s Entertainment Network in the United States and Discovery Channel and CBS in the U.K. For those who want to see psychics handle a spooky paranormal activity, Rescue Medium gives an up-close look at real-life ghostbusting.\n\nIMDb\n\n8. Psychic Investigators\n\nWhen cases get cold, sometimes it requires psychic investigation to solve the mystery. Psychic Investigators is a true-crime series in which psychics help to find missing clues, discover new leads, and figure out what really happened at the scene of the crime. Like many other popular true-crime shows, Psychic Investigators draws viewers in with dramatic reconstruction, intriguing crime details, and interviews with key characters.\n\nThis series aired on the True Crime Network from 2006 to 2008. From solving cold case murders from 30 years earlier to locating missing persons, this is the ultimate psychic show to satisfy the detective within.\n\nIMDb\n\n9. Ghost Whisperer\n\nGhost Whisperer, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, is a supernatural television series about Melinda Gordon, who can speak with earthbound spirits. These spirits need Gordon\u2019s help in order to move on, and she must use her mediumship abilities to relay important information to the living. However, the messages she receives are often confusing, so she must piece together the clues to understand the spirits\u2019 needs.\n\nThe five seasons of this show were aired on CBS from 2006 through 2010. Although it\u2019s a fictional series, Ghost Whisperer does a great job depicting the struggles of mediumship, such as having to decipher unclear communication and carrying the emotional responsibility of imparting significant messages. Love Hewitt does a wonderful job in this role, portraying what it\u2019s like to be a medium with psychic abilities. The show depicts how it can feel more like a curse than a blessing at times to have such unusual gifts.\n\nIMDb\n\n10. Medium\n\nMedium is a paranormal drama about the character Allison DuBois, played by Patricia Arquette, who can speak with the deceased, foresee the future, and witness past events in her dreams. When interning as an assistant for a Phoenix District Attorney, DuBois has a dream about a murder, which leads to the successful solving of the case. The seven seasons are centered on DuBois using her psychic gifts to solve cases, convincing nonbelievers of her gift, and living her life as a wife and mother of three.\n\nThe show had 7 seasons between 2005 and 2011 - the first 5 on NBC, and the rest on CBS. Even though this is a fictional show, it has a fantastic plotline that gives viewers a glimpse into the life of a psychic. DuBois is a relatable character, and it\u2019s rewarding to follow along with her psychic journey.\n\nmiriam-doerr/Istockphoto\n\nExploring the Psychic World\n\nFrom providing guidance in the time of loss or crisis to solving cold-case crimes, these shows demonstrate there\u2019s such a wide range of services that psychics can provide.

The comparisons will assist you in connecting with the perfect psychic for you.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Top10.com and was syndicated by MediaFeed.org\n\nPerseomed /Istockphoto\n\nMore from MediaFeed"

            "article_content": "Part of what makes The Sims 4 such an enduring favorite among cozy gamers is that the options for how to play are basically endless. For some, it\u2019s all about Create a Sim, while others spend hours building their dream house in Build Mode. And then, there\u2019s always those generational challenges, carefully crafted a legacy family with specific rules and specifications. But it\u2019s not just Simmers who have endless options in The Sims 4. Their Sims have a true wealth of options when it comes to their chosen career, and some are better than others.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nFor those who have the game fully loaded with Expansion Packs, there are over 50 career options in The Sims 4. While some are part-time ways for teenage Sims to earn a few Simoleons, many are in-depth adventures up the career ladder to the covered Career Level 10. But which Sims 4 careers are the very best? Based on their depth and engagement, these 10 top the list.\n\n1. Reaper\n\nA Reaper gets to work in The Sims 4 Life & Death\n\nExpansion: Life & Death\n\nThe Reaper career is the newest addition to The Sims 4, and it shows. This career brings everything gamers love about Active careers, while polishing up some of the issues that earlier careers bring into play. Starting as a Grimtern and working their way up, Sims in this career field learn to reap souls and comfort the beloved they\u2019ve left behind.\n\nDoes it get a little bit repetitive eventually? Yes. But there are a good variety of daily tasks and showing up to work with The Grim Reaper himself never quite gets old.\n\n2. Detective\n\nClose the case in Sims 4: Get to Work\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nAn oldie but still a goodie, the Detective career was one of the first Active options in The Sims 4. In this job, Sims spend each day collecting clues to solve cases \u2013 with the active help of the big gamer in the sky, of course.\n\nThis is quite an involved career, with players engaged in tasks like visiting crime scenes and interrogating suspects. For those looking to feel involved in their Sims\u2019 career paths, it\u2019s a must.\n\n3. Doctor\n\nScanning patients is part of a day\u2019s work in The Sims 4 doctor career\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nAnother entry from the original trio of Active careers is the Doctor role. Starting with patient intake and cleaning a lot of hospital beds, Sims work their way up to diagnosing and treating patients over time.\n\nThe tasks for this career can get repetitive once you reach the higher ranks, but it\u2019s nearly always entertaining. It\u2019s also hard work, with many steps to diagnose each patient before the day is done. Unfortunately, the Doctor career remains glitchy to this day, but that doesn\u2019t fully remove its charm.\n\n4. Freelancer\n\nFreelance candlemaking is a thing in Eco Lifestyle\n\nExpansion: Base Game, with more options from packs like Paranormal Stuff and Eco Lifestyle\n\nJust like in real life, the Freelancer career comes with its pros and minuses in The Sims 4. Your Sim will sign up with a specific agency based on their skills, from becoming a Freelance Writer, Crafter, or Artist down to investigating the Paranormal.\n\nThe Freelancer career can be glitchy, but when it works, it\u2019s very engaging. Sims will accept and complete gigs, with increasingly high-paid options as they successfully finish prior jobs. Ticking off the tasks can keep gamers engaged far more successfully than heading to the office for an Active career.\n\n5. Actor\n\nPut on a show as a Sims 4 actor\n\nExpansion: Get Famous\n\nFor Sims who dream of the spotlight, the Actor career offers an opportunity to rise through the ranks from one-off commercial gigs to their own feature film. Added three years after the initial introduction of Active careers, the Actor profession does away with some of the issues from earlier iterations.\n\nOn-the-job tasks include getting hair and makeup done, getting to know co-stars and the crew, and rehearsing lines before finally filming some scenes. This career offers some flexibility as players can choose which acting gigs their Sim takes on, making it a more dynamic option than straightforward ladder-climbing careers.\n\n6. Interior Decorator\n\nShowing off swatches as a Sims 4 interior decorator\n\nExpansion: Dream Home Decorator\n\nFor those Simmers who spend more time in Build Mode than anywhere else, this is the Active career to go for. As an Interior Decorator, Sims will get to step inside homes around town, remodeling them with new decor and furniture.\n\nThe gameplay for this career involves listening to clients and then getting into the Build Mode nitty gritty to bring them to life. While there isn\u2019t as much variety here as with some other Active careers, it\u2019s a great choice for those who treat The Sims 4 like an interior decorating game anyway.\n\n7. Video Game Streamer\n\nGaming for fun and profit in The Sims 4\n\nExpansion: High School Years\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the inception of it all, but there are few things quite as entertaining as having a Sim get really into gaming. The High School Years expansion added a new part-time career that reflects the reality of streaming as a way to make a living in the modern era.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t as dynamic as an Active career or as in-depth as a full-time profession, the Video Game Streamer job is just a ton of fun. Sims raise that video gaming skill and spend time streaming, earning money through tips from fans and learning the ropes for the Entrepreneurial skill. Whether it\u2019s a gateway to a longer-term Freelance career or your Sim\u2019s supplement during college, this part-time job is one of the best.\n\n8. Culinary\n\nEven home chefs know how to hustle in Sims 4\n\nExpansion: Base Game\n\nSome Simmers are in it for the cooking, as the constant stream of new cooking-centered content for The Sims 4 can attest. The Culinary career has been around from the beginning, but it\u2019s still one of the best thanks to the constant addition of new recipes and ways to prep food.\n\nThe Culinary career isn\u2019t an active one, but players will spend plenty of time cooking or mixing drinks for the daily tasks. With so many recipes to choose from and the recently expanded array of kitchen gadgets, Simmers can really get a lot out of this career even if they\u2019re only with their Sims at home.\n\n9. Business Owner\n\nSell clothes, cupcakes, and more in The Sims 4: Get to Work\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nOwning a business doesn\u2019t always work as EA intended, but it\u2019s still one of the most interesting ways to deeply engage with the work element of The Sims 4. Sims can own a variety of business lots, from retail to bakeries and food carts and beyond.\n\nRunning these businesses is a full-on process, from buying or building the lot to creating and selling merchandise. Set prices, engage with customers, and get ready to earn\u2026 or not. This way of bringing in Simoleons is a bit like owning a real business and will take over the day-to-day, but some Simmers like it that way.\n\n10. Landlord\n\nCollecting rent in The Sims 4 Landlord career\n\nExpansion: For Rent\n\nOpinions on The Sims 4: For Rent are a bit mixed, but the ability to buy Residential Rentals and become a landlord is one of the best things the game offers. It\u2019s incredibly dynamic, with the ability to fill an owned unit with tenants, create house rules, and more.\n\nAs a Property Manager, players enjoy a variety of interactions that let them engage with their tenants, including asking about the living conditions and evicting them. Notifications will bring in various issues that Sims need to manage in their units, keeping gamers on their toes \u2013 sometimes a little too much."

And so, there was little sympathy to be spared when Carmichael finally realised beyond any doubt that the demonic entity possessing 13-year-old Lilly D'Abo (Ingrid Torelli) was the real deal.\n\nAfter seeing the demon kill others working on the TV show, Carmichael hilariously decides to pledge his allegiance to the demon in a vain bid save his own skin. But of course, the possessed Lilly doesn't accept, instead using her abilities to burn Haig, causing his flesh to melt away as he falls down dead.\n\nCouldn't have happened to a nicer guy, honestly."

            "article_content": "Hayley Atwell\u2019s Peggy Carter was first introduced to audiences in 2011\u2019s Captain America: The First Avenger as an MI6 agent assisting the Strategic Scientific Reserve during World War II. Their secret project is a super soldier program that transforms a frail Steve Rogers into the enhanced Captain America. Carter and Cap would soon develop a romantic interest in one another, but his seeming death put an end to their budding relationship. Luckily for Marvel fans, the two would later reunite as seen in Captain America: The Winter Solider, and again at the end of Avengers: Endgame, where it\u2019s revealed that Rogers stayed in the past to settle down with Carter.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nBut Carter was much more than a mere love interest. Intelligent, resourceful, and not afraid to embark on a dangerous mission, Atwell\u2019s Marvel character starred in her own two-season television show, Agent Carter, which sees her post-WWII adventures working for the Strategic Scientific Reserve. While the show was mostly contained to its own world, it nevertheless helped explain the past lore of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, making Carter a more important character than she might seem. Now, ten years after the show\u2019s premiere, we take a look at the various times that Agent Carter referenced (and even set up!) the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n#1 \u2013 The Creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nThe Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR) was a central intelligence and counter-espionage agency established to ward off the growing threat of the Nazis and HYDRA during WWII. Peggy Carter was one of its top agents and embarked on numerous important missions with the organization, such as neutralizing the last surviving HYDRA base (that they knew about, at least) towards the end of the war. Carter and the SSR continued their work after WWII \u2013 even setting up a new facility in Los Angeles \u2013 to investigate bizarre crimes, often involving the paranormal.\n\nThe SSR may have played a major role in Agent Carter, but it was first introduced in Captain America: The First Avenger. But not only that, the top-secret agency would eventually form the basis for the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division, also known as S.H.I.E.L.D., which would play a major role in multiple MCU films under the leadership of Nick Fury. Naturally it would all come crashing down in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, thanks to HYDRA of course.\n\n#2 \u2013 Howard Stark\n\nHoward Stark was an inventor and industrialist whose brilliance was unmatched. He played an important role during the SSR\u2019s early days, helping them develop technology to fight the Nazis and HYDRA. After WWII, he often worked closely with Peggy Carter, such as when he recruited her to help him retrieve his stolen tech that appeared on the black market.\n\nHoward is the father of Tony Stark aka Iron Man, who kicked off the MCU. It would later be revealed that Howard was a founding member of S.H.I.E.L.D. The character made sporadic yet impactful appearances throughout the MCU; while it\u2019s established that Tony always had an uneasy relationship with his father, he gradually learns how much Howard truly cared about him, culminating in an incognito Tony seeing Howard one last time during the time heist in Avengers: Endgame.\n\n#3 \u2013 Arnim Zola\n\nArnim Zola was a high-ranking HYDRA scientist who worked closely with the Red Skull. Together, they harnessed the power of the Tesseract to develop advanced weapons until their plans were stopped by Captain America. After WWII, Zola was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. wherein he secretly kept HYRDA alive, slowly rebuilding its ranks. When Zola was stricken with a terminal illness, he uploaded his consciousness into a complex computer system and continued to oversee Project Oversight.\n\nWhile Zola\u2019s primary appearances were in Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, he did make a cameo in Agent Carter. He was seen in the episode \u201cValediction\u201d in which it\u2019s revealed that he is the cellmate of the recently apprehended Johann Fennhoff; Zola, of course, wastes no time in recruiting him into HYDRA.\n\n#4 \u2013 Jarvis\n\nInitially in the MCU, J.A.R.V.I.S. was Tony Stark\u2019s personal AI assistant, a digital butler of sorts who accompanied him pretty much everywhere, even when he was suited up as Iron Man and saving the world with the Avengers. This was pretty far removed from the comics wherein Jarvis is an actual stereotypical butler to Stark; the decision was made to make him an AI assistant in the MCU to avoid comparisons to the Batman films which also featured a billionaire playboy with a British butler. However, Agent Carter went back to the source material by giving Howard Stark \u2013 Tony\u2019s father \u2013 a butler named Jarvis. The original Jarvis presented in the show also appeared in Avengers: Endgame still assisting Howard well into the 1970s, and cementing the canon status of Agent Carter in the MCU.\n\n#5 \u2013 Dum Dum Dugan and the Howling Commandos\n\nIn the comics, the Howling Commandos were a team of soldiers led by Sgt. Nick Fury who embarked on dangerous missions together during WWII. Several of these soldiers \u2013 including Fury\u2019s right-hand man Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader \u201cDum Dum\u201d Dugan \u2013 would join S.H.I.E.L.D. with Fury after the war. We got a version of the Howling Commandos in Captain America: The First Avenger, in which Cap recruits several freed POWs to join his squad taking out HYDRA bases during the war.\n\nDum Dum Dugan and a different iteration of the Howling Commandos appeared in Agent Carter episode \u201cThe Iron Ceiling\u201d wherein they join Carter on a mission to Eastern Europe to learn more about the secret organization, Leviathan. Even though the war was over, Dum Dum and his Howling Commandos were more than happy to suit up and dive into a dangerous assignment they might not return from."

            "article_content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSam Altman started 2025 with a bold declaration: OpenAI has figured out how to create artificial general intelligence (AGI), a term commonly understood as the point where AI systems can comprehend, learn, and perform any intellectual task that a human can.\n\nIn a reflective blog post published over the weekend, he also said the first wave of AI agents could join the workforce this year, marking what he describes as a pivotal moment in technological history.\n\nAltman painted a picture of OpenAI's journey from a quiet research lab to a company that claims to be on the brink of creating AGI.\n\nThe timeline seems ambitious\u2014perhaps too ambitious\u2014while ChatGPT celebrated its second birthday just over a month ago, Altman suggests the next paradigm of AI models capable of complex reasoning is already here.\n\nFrom there, it\u2019s all about integrating near-human AI into society until AI beats us at everything.\n\nWen AGI, Wen ASI?\n\nAltman\u2019s elaboration on what AGI implies remained vague, and his timeline predictions raised eyebrows among AI researchers and industry veterans.\n\n\u201cWe are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it,\" Altman wrote. \"We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents \u2018join the workforce\u2019 and materially change the output of companies.\u201d\n\nAltman\u2019s explanation is vague because there is no standardized definition of AGI. The bar has needed to be raised higher each time as AI models become more powerful but not necessarily more capable.\n\n\u201cWhen considering what Altman said about AGI-level AI agents, it's important to focus on how the definition of AGI has been evolving,\" Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.ai and Chairman of the ASI Alliance, told Decrypt.\n\n\"While these systems can already pass many of the traditional benchmarks associated with AGI, such as the Turing test, this doesn\u2019t imply that they are sentient,\" Sheikh said. \"AGI has not yet reached a level of true sentience, and I don\u2019t believe it will for quite some time.\u201d\n\nThe disconnect between Altman's optimism and expert consensus raises questions about what he means by \"AGI.\" His elaboration on AI agents \"joining the workforce\" in 2025 sounds more like advanced automation than true artificial general intelligence.\n\n\u201cSuperintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut is Altman correct when he says AGI or agent integration will be a thing in 2025? Not everyone is so sure.\n\n\u201cThere are simply too many bugs and inconsistencies with existing AI models that must be ironed out first,\u201d Charles Wayn, co-founder of decentralized super app Galxe told Decrypt. \u201cThat said, it\u2019s likely a matter of years rather than decades before we see AGI-level AI agents.\u201d\n\nSome experts suspect Altman\u2019s bold predictions might serve another purpose.\n\nIn any case, OpenAI has been burning through cash at an astronomical rate, requiring massive investments to keep its AI development on track.\n\nPromising imminent breakthroughs could help maintain investor interest despite the company's substantial operating costs, according to some.\n\n\u2248 \u201cWe are now confident that we can spin bullshit at unprecedented levels, and get away with it, so we now aspire to aim beyond that, to hype in purest sense of that word. We love our products, but we are here for the glorious next rounds of funding. With infinite funding, we\u2026 https://t.co/cH9xN5oJxK \u2014 Gary Marcus (@GaryMarcus) January 6, 2025\n\nThat's quite an asterisk for someone claiming to be on the verge of one of humanity's most significant technological breakthroughs.\n\nStill, others are backing Altman's claims.\n\n\u201cIf Sam Altman is saying that AGI is coming soon, then he probably has some data or business acumen to back up this claim,\u201d Harrison Seletsky, director of business development at digital identity platform SPACE ID told Decrypt.\n\nSeletsky said \u201cbroadly intelligent AI agents\u201d may be a year or two away if Altman\u2019s statements are true and tech keeps evolving in the same space.\n\nThe CEO of OpenAI hinted that AGI is not enough for him, and his company is aiming at ASI: a superior state of AI development in which models exceed human capacities at all tasks.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to turn our aim beyond that to superintelligence in the true sense of the word. We love our current products, but we are here for the glorious future. With superintelligence, we can do anything else,\u201d Altman wrote in the blog.\n\nWhile Altman didn\u2019t elaborate on a timeframe for ASI, some expect that robots can substitute all humans by 2116.\n\nAltman previously said ASI is only a matter of \u201ca few thousand days,\u201d yet experts from the Forecasting Institute give a 50% probability ASI will be achieved in at least 2060.\n\nKnowing how to reach AGI is not the same as being able to reach it.\n\nYan Lecun, Meta\u2019s chief AI researcher, said humanity is still far from reaching such a milestone due to limitations in the training technique or the hardware required to process such vast amounts of information.\n\nI said that reaching Human-Level AI \"will take several years if not a decade.\" Sam Altman says \"several thousand days\" which is at least 2000 days (6 years) or perhaps 3000 days (9 years).\n\nSo we're not in disagreement. But I think the distribution has a long tail: it could take\u2026 https://t.co/EZmuuWyeWz \u2014 Yann LeCun (@ylecun) October 16, 2024\n\nEliezer Yudkowsky, a pretty influential AI researcher and philosopher, has also argued that this may be a hype move to basically benefit OpenAI in the short term.\n\nOpenAI benefits both from the short-term hype, and also from people then later saying, \"Ha ha look at this hype-based field that didn't deliver, very not dangerous, no need to shut down OpenAI.\" https://t.co/ybkh9DGUm5 \u2014 Eliezer Yudkowsky \u23f9\ufe0f (@ESYudkowsky) January 5, 2025\n\nHuman Workers vs AI Agents\n\nSo, agentic behavior is a thing\u2014unlike AGI or ASI\u2014and the quality and versatility of AI Agents are increasing faster than many expect.\n\nFrameworks like Crew AI, Autogen, or LangChain made it possible to create systems of AI Agents with different capabilities, including the ability to work hand in hand with users.\n\nWhat does it mean for the average Joe, and will this be a danger or a blessing for everyday workers?\n\nExperts aren't too concerned.\n\n\u201cI don't believe we\u2019ll see dramatic organizational changes overnight,\u201d Fetch.ai's Sheikh said. \u201cWhile there may be some reduction in human capital, particularly for repetitive tasks, these advancements might also address more sophisticated repetitive tasks that current Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems cannot handle.\n\nSeletsky also thinks Agents will most likely conduct repetitive tasks instead of those requiring some level of decision-making.\n\nIn other words, humans are safe if they can use their creativity and expertise to their advantage\u2014and assume the consequences of their actions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think decision-making will necessarily be led by AI agents in the near future, because they can reason and analyze, but they don't have that human ingenuity yet,\u201d he told Decrypt..\n\nAnd there seems to be some degree of consensus, at least in the short term.\n\n\u201cThe key distinction lies in the lack of \u201chumanity\u201d in AGI\u2019s approach. It\u2019s an objective, data-driven approach to financial research and investing. This can help rather than hinder financial decisions because it removes some emotional biases that often lead to rash decisions,\u201d Galxe's Wayn said.\n\nExperts are already aware of the possible social implications of adopting AI Agents.\n\nResearch from the City University of Hong Kong argues that Generative AI and agents in general must collaborate with humans instead of substituting them so society can achieve healthy and continuous growth.\n\n\u201cAI has created both challenges and opportunities in various fields, including technology, business, education, healthcare, as well as arts and humanities,\u201d the research paper reads. \u201cAI-human collaboration is the key to addressing challenges and seizing opportunities created by generative AI.\u201d\n\nDespite this push for human-AI collaboration, companies have started substituting human workers for AI agents with mixed results.\n\nGenerally speaking, they always need a human to handle tasks agents cannot do due to hallucinations, training limitations, or simply lack of context understanding.\n\nAs of 2024, nearly 25% of CEOs are excited by the idea of having their farm of digitally enslaved agents that do the same work humans do without labor costs involved.\n\nStill, other experts argue that an AI agent can arguably do better for almost 80% of what a CEO does\u2014so nobody is really safe.\n\nEdited by Sebastian Sinclair"

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Understanding the Potential Challenges of Coupon Affiliates How Bluepear Can Help Brands Track Coupon Affiliates Why Choose Bluepear for Protecting Your Brand? Maximize the Value of Your Affiliate Partnerships!\n\nAs digital marketing has evolved over the last couple of decades, companies have used affiliate marketing to drive traffic to their websites and generate sales. This article will explore how affiliate coupon codes can affect your brand and how Bluepear\u2019s advanced brand protection technology can address the challenges while ensuring fair traffic generation.\n\nUnderstanding the Potential Challenges of Coupon Affiliates\n\n1. The Potential Impact of Coupon Codes on Your Marketing Funnel\n\nThese coupon codes often appeal to existing customers instead of attracting new ones. Usually, those who seek out affiliate coupon codes are already familiar with your brand and are ready to make a purchase. These customers likely had the opportunity to learn about your products through ads, organic searches, word of mouth, or an influencer who is affiliated with your program.\n\nThus, affiliate coupon sites can end up at the bottom of the conversion funnel, which can lead to additional costs for traffic that has already been attracted to your site through other channels.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\n2. Coupon Codes Can Lead to Discount-Seeking Behavior & Lower Cart Values\n\nCoupons incentivize discounts merely by their nature. As with many brands, your goal for offering a deal will likely attract new and repeat customers. However, this can also backfire because it teaches consumers to secure the lowest price possible for the products they want. This can result in reduced average order value (AOV) over time, which can impact profitability. Encouraging a reliance on discounts can be an unintentional consequence of coupon affiliates.\n\n3. Customer Frustrations & the Risk to Brand Reputation\n\nCoupon affiliate programs work to accomplish their own business goals, which is to attract a constant stream of traffic to their own websites. To do this, they scrape all the possible codes and distribute them all, whether they are valid or not. This can lead to customers coming across expired coupon codes, which may create a less favorable experience with your brand.\n\n4. A Lack of Transparency in Coupon Code Distribution\n\nA common problem with affiliate coupon sites is that they often fail to disclose the methods of attracting users to their websites. They may be driving traffic through paid search campaigns, deceptive SEO practices, or unapproved partnerships with other websites and marketing platforms. This lack of clarity can make it more difficult for brands to formulate an effective marketing strategy for their affiliate programs.\n\nAffiliates who don\u2019t disclose their network connections and activities leave many brands in the dark about whether their codes are being used in ways that decrease the value of their brand, if and when violations occur, and what specific affiliates or third-party partners engage in the misuse of these codes. This uncertainty can challenge trust and hinder collaborative relationships between brands and affiliate partners.\n\nHow Bluepear Can Help Brands Track Coupon Affiliates\n\nThough coupon affiliate programs are often seen as a challenge in digital marketing, Bluepear can provide a solution with its brand protection technology. Below is a hypothetical brand, \u201cJam,\u201d to illustrate how Bluepear\u2019s technology helps combat affiliate coupon misuse.\n\nStep 1: Identifying Violations\n\nJam has to establish clear guidelines in its affiliate program terms and conditions. These terms include prohibitions on promotion through coupon codes and brand bidding.\n\nThough the policies clearly outline these guidelines, Jam notices that users access codes after searching ads that feature phrases like \u201c20% off Jam coupon.\u201d\n\nStep 2: Using Bluepear to Detect Coupon Misuse\n\nJam partners with Bluepear, and with their help, they are able to gain visibility into how their coupons are being misused.

            "article_content": "Source: Creatista/Shutterstock\n\nThe linguistic contributions Gen Zers brought to our society are officially vintage in the face of Gen Alpha\u2019s influence. Born after 2010, this iPad generation is fluent in a rapidly evolving language that leaves many parents scratching their heads.\n\nWords and phrases that once felt like the cutting edge of cool, like \"lit\" or \"fire,\" are now gathering digital dust. For parents, it feels like the gap between generations has never been wider, as our teens communicate in a code of memes, viral trends, and game references. Parents find themselves asking, \"Is this a curse, a dance move, or a video game boss I should know about?\"\n\nTrying to have a conversation with a Gen Alpha teen can feel like stepping into a never-ending \"Skibidi Toilet\" meme\u2014bizarre, fast-paced, and hard to follow. It\u2019s not just about knowing the words; it\u2019s about understanding the cultural ecosystem those words belong to.\n\nMany parents express frustration, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re not speaking the same language anymore,\u201d or outright dismiss the new slang as being too reductionist, or degenerate. What was once straightforward communication now feels like navigating an inside joke. However, by embracing the nuances of our teens\u2019 worldview, we can begin to bridge the communication gap.\n\nSpeaking Gen Alpha\n\nDescribed by some as \"cringe\" or even \"brain rot,\" this generation\u2019s slang often leaves parents feeling out of the loop, and sometimes downright stupid, as they attempt to decode it. Terms like \"negative aura\" have replaced the familiar Gen Z phrase \"bad vibes,\" and while the meaning may be similar, the shift in language can make parents feel like they\u2019re always a step behind.\n\nTake the word \"sigma,\" for example. To Gen Alpha, calling someone \"sigma\" means they\u2019re cool or a leader. Meanwhile, \"Ohio\" has taken on the meaning of something cringe-worthy or embarrassing. And if your teens say they \"have rizz,\" don\u2019t panic\u2014the word was added to the dictionary in 2023 and just means that they have charm or charisma.\n\nParenting Toward Individuation\n\nAt the heart of every generation\u2019s linguistic evolution is the desire to differentiate themselves from those who came before. Each generation creates new phrases and trends not only to connect with their peers on a deeper level but also to separate themselves from previous generations. This creates a social gap that can make communication with parents feel strained.\n\nThe culture Gen Alpha is creating\u2014through slang, social media trends, and online memes\u2014is a living, breathing expression of their values, humor, worldview, and communication style. It is important to remember that the teenage years are a time of individuation, socialization, and identity formation.\n\nThanks to social media, Gen Alpha slang has evolved more rapidly but still serves the same purpose, which is for adults to not understand. Teens know they are at times annoying their parents, and they mean to. It\u2019s important to allow our teens to have their own language and space to be themselves. While researching the new slang is an option, asking your child what they mean, or reflecting back what you understood, will help your teen feel heard. Curiosity is the most important aspect of parenting; rather than trying to crack the code of Gen Alpha slang, the key is being attuned to their emotions.\n\nFrom Big Sad to Big Happy\n\nAs confusing as Gen Alpha\u2019s communication style may seem, it's important to remember that this is developmentally appropriate and a natural part of the individuation process.\n\nAs parents, we have the privilege of witnessing our children\u2019s identities unfold, and by embracing their unique expressions, we can bridge the generational gap and foster deeper connections."

Drawing from current deployment patterns \u2014 where companies like OpenAI are racing to build supersized data centers to meet the ever-increasing demand for compute power \u2014 three critical infrastructure shifts are reshaping enterprise AI deployment.\n\nHere\u2019s what technical leaders need to know, beyond the hype.\n\nEnglish as the new programming language\n\nThe \u201cnew language\u201d isn\u2019t another Python; it\u2019s English. In 2025, more platforms will empower users without coding experience. These no-code AI tools will allow founders, entrepreneurs and creators to build intelligent systems and services with ease.\n\nInstead of spending months learning a new programming language, individuals can focus on clarity of thought and expression in English, communicating with AI in conversational, natural language. Natural language interfaces are fundamentally restructuring how enterprises architect their AI systems, eliminating a translation layer.\n\nI expect a surge of educational resources, platforms and communities dedicated to teaching the new language of AI interaction. This will go beyond prompt engineering to include building workflows, designing product flows and structuring data \u2014 all without writing code. These educational platforms will be foundational stepping stones for those entering the tech landscape without traditional programming skills.\n\nThe great GPU race: Innovation amid hardware constraints\n\nLarge corporations are fiercely competing to advance GPU and AI hardware innovation. But while they have capital, they face a slow and costly race.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently admitted that a lack of computing capacity is a major barrier to his company\u2019s growth.\n\nBig Tech\u2019s GPU obsession is like gold rush fever, but the winners will be those who learn how to mine computing power efficiently. Startups are nimble and motivated to find efficient, cost-effective alternatives to fuel their AI infrastructure.\n\nStartups will explore creative solutions to sidestep reliance on top-tier GPUs. Efficient GPU-sharing algorithms and decentralized networks that leverage idle computing power are at the forefront of democratizing computing power away from Big Tech. Expect the rise of innovative services enabling pooled or fractional GPU resources, allowing users to \u201crent\u201d or share compute power as needed.\n\nBig companies can afford to spend billions on computing, but real innovation will come from those who must get scrappy.\n\nAI agents will pay each other in crypto\n\nBy the end of 2025, we may enter a world with thousands of AI agents, each excelling at specific tasks. Whether assisting with marketing analytics, legal drafting or personalized education, these agents will perform well-defined functions autonomously and efficiently.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch: These agents will need a way to transact automatically, and traditional payment systems like PayPal weren\u2019t built for autonomous transactions between AI agents.\n\nWith each agent needing to be compensated for services in real-time, cryptocurrency could become the \u201cnative\u201d currency of AI.\n\nThe solution emerging from leading enterprises combines blockchain-based smart contracts with traditional payment rails. These hybrid systems enable instant, secure transactions between agents while maintaining regulatory compliance.\n\nThe technical architecture includes rate-limiting mechanisms, fraud detection systems and automated auditing of agent interactions \u2014 essential features for enterprise deployment. This shift will create opportunities for innovations in decentralized payment solutions, fostering a new era of crypto-driven ecosystems where AI agents can transact, pay each other and form micro-economies.\n\nBlockchain technology is a secure, transparent way for agents to interact, exchange value and establish trust without centralized oversight. This is the missing link that lets agents scale while maintaining a secure network for their interactions.\n\nThese three shifts \u2014 natural language interfaces making technology more accessible, startups innovating around hardware constraints, and AI agents transacting autonomously \u2014 are signals of a new era in AI. Enterprises that recognize and adapt to these changes will be better positioned to leverage AI\u2019s full potential.\n\nKaterina Stroponiati is the founder of Brilliant Minds, pioneering a visionary approach in venture capital by focusing on founders over 50, challenging age-related stigmas in entrepreneurship. Brilliant Minds is a longevity intervention with a twist, demonstrating that older individuals can be innovative and forward-thinking. Previously, she was a founding partner at Monday Capital, where she spearheaded investments in deep tech and technologies around longevity, particularly brain health. With an engineering background and experience as the ex-founder and CEO of a venture-backed environmental technology company, Stroponiati brings a unique perspective to advancing the field of longevity.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman"

            "article_content": "You may imagine that the high-definition maps cars use come from those Google StreetView mapping cars with the cameras on top, but nope! For 40 years our cars have mostly used data from Here Technologies (nee Navtech). Today the company\u2014jointly owned by VW AG, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and others\u2014powers the ADAS and navigation systems in over 220 million vehicles around the globe.\n\nAt CES 2025, Here announced a 10-year, $1 billion cloud infrastructure agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to support AI-powered, livestreaming map and location services for automotive, transportation, logistics, and mobility companies across the globe. Here\u2019s how this deal promises to improve your daily drive:\n\nIntelligent Speed Assistance Compliance\n\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament requires vehicles to notify drivers whenever the speed limit changes during a drive. At CES 2025, BMW and Here announced it will ensure compliance using Here\u2019s AI-powered UniMap system. Introduced at CES 2023, UniMap includes lane-level models of the global road network providing a single semantically consistent map of the world designed for use with all onboard location-services needs and large-language modeling. UniMap and the software development kit (SDK) used to integrate it into vehicles speeds the time to market for AI-enhanced features like intelligent route planning that incorporates EV charging at stations known to be functional and open.\n\nHere for Sony Honda Mobility AFEELA\n\nAlso at CES 2025, SHM demonstrated its digital cockpit, which includes intelligent, connected, software-defined navigation powered by the Here Navigation SDK and featuring advanced visualization and augmented reality. The infotainment system\u2019s many screens all contribute to delivering robust guidance plus safety information, while seamlessly connecting with the owner/driver\u2019s \u201cdigital life.\u201d What\u2019s more, the system\u2019s safety and autonomy features were partially developed on an AWS cloud-based Digital Proving Ground (DPG) platform. Here, Honda has built a \u201cdata lake\u201d that leverages AWS compute capabilities and generative AI to speed software-defined-vehicle development.\n\nHere AI Assistant Virtual Copilot\n\nAnother CES 2025 Here announcement was the rollout of its AI Assistant, which leverages multiple large language models to enhance driver safety, improve time and fuel efficiency, and boost the accuracy of arrival-time estimates. Families on vacation will be able to ask for noteworthy landmarks worth stopping at, and to intersperse these with regular rest area, restaurant, and refueling stops. The system is designed to handle complex requests, like \u201cfind me a nice caf\u00e9 near a beach,\u201d or \u201cget me home by 5pm while avoiding stops and avoiding tolls,\u201d or \u201croute me to Las Vegas, with a charging and coffee stop 50 miles before I get there.\u201d\n\nAlways Learning\n\nAs with Waze, the Here map database can accept input from users about temporary speed limits, closed roads, construction zones, and more to ensure that the cloud\u2019s map database remains as accurate as possible. We believe these inputs can be made using natural speech, saving the effort and distraction of pressing specific buttons on a screen.\n\nHere WeGo Pro App\n\nLogistics drivers may notice an improvement in their time efficiency with Here\u2019s new WeGo Pro app, rolling out later in 2025. It promises best-in-class truck routing and real-time fleet-management capabilities, leveraging Here\u2019s AI Assistant to tailor delivery routes based on time or cost constraints with the ability to quickly adapt to changing road conditions for seamless and efficient operations."

Will he abuse his political power of being co-president, or whatever he calls himself now, to mess with a business competitor? I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll do that. I genuinely don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman once collaborated with Elon Musk to create the artificial intelligence company. While he doesn\u2019t think too fondly of Musk\u2019s future, he did say he doesn\u2019t believe Musk will use his new political influence to target rivals (Getty Images)\n\nMusk and Altman once sought to \u201csave\u201d humanity from the dangers of artificial intelligence through the co-founded company OpenAI \u2013 the parent company of ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, a dispute over the direction of the company, and an internal power struggle, led to a falling out between the two. Musk ultimately left the company in 2018 and has since worked to create his own AI company.\n\nThe battle between Altman and Musk turned publicly nasty last year when Musk filed a lawsuit against the company and Altman claiming he and other executives breached the company\u2019s founding agreement to benefit humanity over profit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk made his feelings about Altman and OpenAI evident in mocking social media posts.\n\nMusk dropped the lawsuit but filed another one against Altman and OpenAI, this time elevating his accusations to claim OpenAI worked with Microsoft, an investor, to create a monopoly. The billionaire also alleged the company violated its founding claim as a nonprofit by pursuing profit.\n\nOpenAI has denied the allegations.\n\nMusk has proven to be a powerful figure in politics thanks to his proximity to President-elect Donald Trump (Getty Images)\n\nIn December, the artificial intelligence company posted a lengthy, accusatory blog post that included screenshots of emails and texts showing Musk agreeing the company should pivot from nonprofit to for-profit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey claimed Musk bitterly left the company after the board refused to make him CEO or agree to his suggestion to merge Tesla and OpenAI. They claim Musk started his artificial intelligence company, xAI, to compete directly with OpenAI.\n\n\u201cHe says a lot of things, starts them, undoes them, gets sued, sues, gets in fights with the government, gets investigated by the government. That\u2019s just Elon being Elon,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg.\n\nBut Altman believes that he and Musk still share a \u201cconviction\u201d that artificial intelligence is important but needs to be handled carefully.\n\nDespite Musk\u2019s close proximity to Trump \u2013 having been named co-chair of the advisory board the Department of Government Efficiency \u2013 Altman does not think Musk would go so far as to use his power to quash a competitor.\n\n\u201cMay turn out to be proven wrong,\u201d Altman added."

            "article_content": "Sudan has been engulfed in a severe humanitarian and political crisis since the civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted on April 15, 2023. The political vacuum created after the fall of Omar al-Bashir\u2019s regime in 2019, combined with a power struggle and deepening mistrust, has pushed the country into a full-scale civil war. The conflict has not only brought catastrophic consequences for the Sudanese people but has also become more complex due to the involvement of regional and global actors.\n\nIn this context, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s mediation initiative to end the conflict and ensure regional stability has the potential to contribute significantly to resolving the crisis in Sudan while enhancing T\u00fcrkiye's diplomatic presence in Africa. However, it is essential to understand the origins and progression of Sudan's civil war to evaluate the opportunities and challenges of this initiative effectively.\n\nRoots of the Sudan civil war\n\nThe roots of Sudan's civil war can be traced back to the political vacuum that emerged after al-Bashir\u2019s regime was overthrown in April 2019. The power struggle between the two main factions of the transitional government, the SAF and the RSF, has been at the heart of the conflict. Disputes over the integration of the RSF into the national army ignited tensions. The aim of RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, to operate as an independent force clashed with SAF leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan\u2019s opposition to such autonomy. The conflict escalated into open warfare on April 15, 2023, when the RSF launched attacks on military installations in Khartoum, quickly spreading across the country.\n\nThe war has brought Sudan to the brink of a humanitarian and economic collapse. Khartoum has become the epicenter of the conflict, with its infrastructure severely damaged. Interruptions in electricity, water and health care services have displaced millions. According to the United Nations, over 8 million people have been internally displaced, while more than 3 million have fled to neighboring countries. The conflict\u2019s expansion into West Darfur has raised allegations of ethnic cleansing, with the RSF and allied militias accused of targeting the Fur population. Attacks by Baggara Arab militias have drawn significant international condemnation.\n\nCease-fire efforts and failures\n\nThe conflict in Sudan has been further complicated by the competing interests of regional and global actors. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) support for the RSF has led the SAF to view the UAE as a party to the conflict. Meanwhile, Russia's ties with the RSF reflect its ambitions to access Sudan's natural resources and establish a military base on the Red Sea coast. Neighboring countries like Chad, South Sudan and the Central African Republic face mounting challenges from refugee flows and border security issues. The United States and the European Union have highlighted human rights violations in West Darfur, calling for stronger sanctions against the conflict parties.\n\nDespite numerous efforts, cease-fire initiatives have repeatedly failed. Temporary truces brokered by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in May 2023 were quickly violated. The African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) have sought to present a comprehensive peace framework. Still, a lack of trust between the warring parties has rendered these efforts unsuccessful. The inability of either side to gain a decisive advantage has prolonged the conflict.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye\u2019s mediation initiative\n\nT\u00fcrkiye has intensified its efforts to mediate the Sudanese civil war and restore regional stability. On Jan. 4, 2025, Deputy Foreign Minister Burhanettin Duran\u2019s official visit to Port Sudan marked a concrete step in this direction. T\u00fcrkiye has adopted a proactive role by leveraging humanitarian diplomacy, economic cooperation and confidence-building measures to address the conflict.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye possesses three critical advantages in mediating the Sudan crisis. First, its historical ties with Sudan and its humanitarian aid initiatives have fostered a positive perception among the Sudanese public. Second, T\u00fcrkiye's recent normalization of relations with the UAE provides a potential dialogue channel between SAF and RSF. Third, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s capacity to collaborate with regional organizations like the African Union and IGAD enhances the legitimacy of its mediation efforts.\n\nHowever, T\u00fcrkiye faces several challenges in this process. The UAE\u2019s overt support for the RSF may lead the SAF to question T\u00fcrkiye's neutrality. Furthermore, the deep mistrust within Sudan and the competing interests of global actors (the U.S., Russia, China and Iran) limit T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s maneuvering space. Therefore, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s ability to propose practical measures, such as confidence-building steps between the SAF and the UAE, temporary cease-fires and resource-sharing agreements, will be crucial for progress.\n\nThe civil war that began in Sudan on April 15, 2023, has evolved into a crisis that affects not only Sudanese society but also the broader region. The humanitarian disasters and international power struggles stemming from the war make its resolution even more challenging.\n\nIn this context, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s mediation initiative offers a critical opportunity to achieve regional stability and enhance its diplomatic influence in Africa. The success of this initiative hinges on T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s commitment to impartiality, the development of trust-building measures between the warring parties and effective collaboration with regional and international actors. By carefully implementing a multidimensional strategy, T\u00fcrkiye could play a lasting role in resolving the Sudanese crisis and establish a model for addressing similar conflicts in the region. Every step in this process must be meticulously planned and executed to sustain the Sudanese people's hope for peace."

            "article_content": "In October, Wall Street celebrated its second year (and counting) in a resounding bull market. While a confluence of factors is responsible for lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to multiple record-closing highs last year, none played a bigger role than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI gives software and systems the ability to make split-second decisions without the need for human input or intervention. It's a technology that has wide-reaching utility in virtually all industries around the globe.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBut as we've seen from other game-changing technologies and innovations over the last couple of decades, not all early stage risers are necessarily long-term winners. The wide variance observed in price targets for artificial intelligence stocks on Wall Street speaks to this mixed outlook.\n\nBased on low-water price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts, the following three premier AI stocks are expected to plunge by up to 86% in the new year.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied downside of 55%\n\nThe first rapidly growing AI stock that at least one Wall Street analyst believes will plummet in 2025 is customizable rack server and storage solutions company Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). According to Mehdi Hosseini or Susquehanna, Supermicro stock is headed for $15 per share, which would equate to a whopping 55% decline, relative to where shares closed on Jan. 3.\n\nOn paper, Supermicro finds itself ideally positioned to take advantage of the AI revolution. Companies are paying big bucks for the data center infrastructure necessary to make split-second decisions, run generative AI solutions, and build/train large language models. In fiscal 2024, Supermicro's net sales surged by 110% to nearly $15 billion.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, Super Micro Computer utilizes Nvidia's ultra-popular graphics processing units (GPUs) in its rack servers. With Nvidia's chips possessing superior computing speed, it's made SuperMicro's servers even more desirable.\n\nBut as you can guess from Hosseini's price target, things haven't gone as planned. In late August, Super Micro Computer was the subject of a research report from noted short-seller Hindenburg Research, which alleged, among other things, \"accounting manipulation.\" Since this report, the company has:\n\nDelayed the filing of its annual report.\n\nHad an early stage probe commenced by federal regulators regarding its accounting practices, per The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHad Ernst & Young resign as the company's auditor.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "While some handheld gaming PC manufacturers are busy cornering the comically large form factor market, Lenovo has slipped in to announce several new - and considerably more portable - devices of its own, including the Legion Go 2 and a handheld utilising SteamOS.\n\nStarting with the Legion Go 2, that's Lenovo's currently still-in-prototype second generation handheld gaming PC, which - alongside its built-in kickstand and ergonomically improved detachable controllers - sports an 8.8-inch OLED display with VRR support, and comes equipped with either the upcoming AMD Ryzen Z2 or Ryzen Z2 Extreme. It can also sport up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD storage, to further boost its beefy credentials.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no hint of a release window or price for the Legion Go 2 just yet, with Lenovo instead choosing to focus its attention on its other newly announced handheld gaming PC: the more modest, and more imminently available, Legion Go S.\n\nA prototype of Lenovo's Legion Go 2. | Image credit: Lenovo\n\nThe Legion Go S offers a sleeker alternative to Lenovo's existing Legion Go, doing away with the former's detachable controllers in favour of a more rounded all-in-one design. It features an 8-inch, 16:10 IPS LCD multi-touch screen (with a 120Hz variable refresh rate and 1920 x 1200 resolution), alongside hall-effect thumbsticks, a redesigned D-pad, and dual stage triggers.\n\nAs for the insides, Legion Go S includes either an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or Z1 Extreme processor, and can be equipped with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD. All this lives inside a 299mm x 127.6 x 22.6 shell and weighs upwards of 730g - around 90g heavier than Steam Deck. Lenovo tells The Verge it's targeting two to 2.5 hours of battery life for demanding games.\n\nThe SteamOS version of Lenovo's Legion Go S (the Windows 11 variant is white). | Image credit: Lenovo\n\nLenovo's first Legion Go S model begins shipping this month, costing \u00a3649.99/$729.99 with the Z2 Go processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It'll be followed in May by a slightly lower-specced \u00a3600/$599.99 variant, featuring the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 1TB storage. Both machines utilise Windows 11, but Lenovo is also working on a SteamOS-powered Go S, making it the first authorised third-party handheld gaming device to utilise Valve's operating system. This is the cheapest of the bunch, costing $499.99 with the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage - and The Verge reports it should also arrive in May.\n\nFor anyone with an eye on the slightly more distant future, however, Digital Foundry has taken a look at AMD's newly announced trio of next-gen Ryzen Z-series APUs - the kind that'll be packed into Lenovo's second generation Legion Go 2 - if you're curious to learn more."

            "article_content": "Dell on Monday announced an overhaul of its PC branding strategy with a simplified naming scheme that bears a striking resemblance to Apple's iPhone nomenclature.\n\n\n\nThe computer manufacturer is retiring its long-standing product names like XPS and Inspiron in favor of three straightforward tiers: Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max \u2013 a clear copy of Apple's iPhone naming convention, which has used \"Pro\" and \"Pro Max\" to distinguish its higher-end models since the iPhone 11 was introduced in 2019.\n\nThe announcement reportedly raised eyebrows at Dell's press briefing ahead of CES. \"Your branding sounds a lot like Apple. Aren't you just following them?\" one audience member asked Dell executives, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\"Customers really prefer names that are easy to remember and easy to pronounce,\" Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke responded to reporters. Buyers shouldn't have to spend time \"figuring out our nomenclature, which at times has been a bit confusing,\" he said.\n\nClarke went on to claim that the new naming strategy was supported by research involving \"tens of thousands of customers,\" and argued that no company owns common words like \"pro\" or \"max.\" The new naming system will \"make it easier for our customers to do business with us,\" added Dell founder and CEO, Michael Dell.\n\nKevin Terwilliger, a vice president of Dell's PC business, explained that the rebrand aims to simplify product recognition for customers, similar to Apple's approach of anchoring products to a single brand name. The gaming-focused Alienware brand, which Dell acquired in 2006, will retain its existing branding.\n\nThe Dell CEO framed the rebranding as part of a broader strategy to capitalize on the aging PC market, particularly as AI capabilities become more important in computing. Many of the new Dell-branded devices will include neural processing units optimized for AI tasks.\n\nPC manufacturers are seeking to reinvigorate sales following a post-pandemic slump, with Dell, HP, and Lenovo all exploring various strategies to encourage upgrades. For what it's worth, Apple isn't the only consumer electronics company to use \"pro\" in its product names. Microsoft has its Surface Pro tablets, for example, but it's hard to imagine the latter attempting to justify the introduction of a \"Surface Pro Max\" while maintaining a straight face."

This includes the creation of landing zones, defining the VPN, gateway connections, network policies, storage policies, hosting key services within a private subnet and setting up the right IAM policies (resource policies, setting up the organization, deletion policies). Creating awareness of the policy of least privilege and addressing frustrations when cloud users ask for more to play with, and as a cloud CoE team, you are rightfully holding your ground that comes with it. The cloud CoE team should collect feedback from the users and tweak policies along the way as they deem fit. As the enterprise user community matures through this learning curve, the CoE team has a pivotal role to play in engaging them proactively, supporting them, meeting their needs and helping them address their pain points to lay a strong foundation for building a robust cloud infrastructure that is scalable to deliver business value.\n\nPartnering with the enterprise architecture team in this stage of the cloud journey can speed up cloud maturity and buttress the foundation further on solid bearings. The cloud CoE team of architects should work with the EA to align with the reference architecture patterns that the CoE team would like the application teams/product teams to follow in their solution design. This strategic and collaborative work serves as a blueprint for the architects to \u2018show and tell\u2019 the concept of designing cloud-effective solutions and shape mindsets towards the \u2018making money with the cloud\u2019 vision. Every company that wants to succeed in scaling AI solutions and capabilities today needs to get this design thinking working for them. Otherwise, it\u2019s like the story of \u2018sour grapes\u2019 with high cloud cost bills coming their way with little value added in the AI domain as it has been for a lot of companies in 2024.\n\n3. WALK FASTER: Develop cloud adoption planning and migration roadmap\n\nWith the CoE and EA teams working in tandem, it\u2019s time to engage the business stakeholders/product owners and develop the plan and roadmap. Understanding business constraints and priorities, and evaluating domains that have opportunities to expand their revenue and grow exponentially upon moving to the cloud are the key parameters to keep in mind. I recommend a structured approach for this phase of the journey."

            "article_content": "Archaeologists recently unveiled remarkable artifacts from Viking graves in Norway \u2014 all thanks to a pair of metal detectorists who unwittingly stumbled across the treasure.\n\nS\u00f8ren Diinhoff, an archaeologist from the University Museum of Bergen, spoke to Fox News Digital about the discovery on Tuesday. The Viking graves were found at Skumsnes farm in Fitjar, located in southwestern Norway, in autumn 2023, but the initial excavation of the site wrapped up towards the end of last year.\n\nDiinhoff said that the graves were found by members of the Bj\u00f8rgvin Detector Club, who immediately alerted a local museum about the discovery. Archaeologists then set to work on excavating the first two graves, which both date back to between 800 and 850 A.D.\n\nDiinhoff told Fox News Digital that both graves, which were filled with coins, jewelry and other treasure, belonged to wealthy women. In the first one, excavators found \"fragments of jewelry indicating it had been a rich grave with significant grave goods.\"\n\nARCHAEOLOGISTS STUMPED BY STRANGE ALIEN-LIKE FIGURINE DATING BACK 7,000 YEARS: 'RAISES QUESTIONS'\n\n\"There were fragments of a couple of gilded oval brooches (also called tortoise brooches) of Norse origin, [and] fragments of a metal cauldron/dish produced in southern England or Ireland with enamel inlay and animal-shaped handles,\" a summary of the first grave read.\n\nOne of the most interesting artifacts uncovered was a book clasp that the Vikings appeared to refashion as a buckle or brooch pin. Diinhoff explained that the clasp was likely raided from a Christian monastery on the Britannic Isles before the ninth century.\n\n\"They put a needle on the back of the clasps, and they could be used as brooches,\" the expert described. \"We think that the clasp in the first grave could very well have come from a Bible in England or Ireland. It had been ripped off and brought back to Norway where it eventually ended up as a woman's brooch.\"\n\nMostly fragments were found in the first grave because the site was likely plundered not long after the burial, Diinhoff said.\n\nARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST CHRISTIAN CHURCHES\n\n\"We have a suspicion that the first grave was opened a long time ago. It may even have been opened in the Viking age,\" he explained, adding that plundering graves was \"not uncommon\" during the Viking age, and that it was possibly done either to steal valuable items or to dishonor the dead.\n\n\"The finds were spread out in fragments in top and around the grave,\" Diinhoff described. \"The jewelry was broken to pieces, but the destruction was clearly not because of erosion. The fractured surfaces showed that the artifacts had been destroyed deliberately and most likely when the grave had been reopened.\"\n\nBut the real treasure was found in the second grave, which included priceless artifacts ranging from textile production tools to high-class jewelry and coins.\n\n\"These tools indicate the buried had skills, but more show that the buried woman was the leader of the farm textile production. High-quality textile production was prestigious and an important financial income,\" the report explained. \"A bronze key found in the grave symbolizes this woman\u2019s central position. She was the carrier of the house key and, as such, leader of the farm household. [What is] probably a frying pan in the grave shows the same.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\"Close to the brooches we found a pearl necklace,\" the research report added. \"It consisted of 46 glass beads of different European and Scandinavian origins, and between the pearls were placed 11 silver coins.\"\n\nOne coin was minted in Jutland between 832 and 840 A.D., while the others were Frankish and produced under the reign of Louis the Pious, the son of Charlemagne. Louis died in 840 A.D.\n\nOverall, Diinhoff said that trade between the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings was not uncommon, though not all \"trade\" was necessarily voluntary. He believes that the coins in the second grave were traded, while the book clasp was stolen during a raid.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle.\n\nIn total, archaeologists fully excavated the womens' two graves, and were able to analyze a third one that was not fully excavated but contained a gilded brooch and 25 glass beads. Historians also believe that the decedents may have been part of the same Viking family.\n\nDiinhoff noted that there was a sense of urgency in terms of excavating other graves at the site, of which there are at least 20.\n\n\"We fear that they will be destroyed in time,\" the Viking expert said. \"The are found just below the turf and there are so many ways they can be ruined\u2026We hope to be able to excavate a few graves every year.\"\n\nDiinhoff also expressed gratitude to the metal detectorists who found the site.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Without them \u2018finding\u2019 the site in the first place, we would not have known about the site,\" the archaeologist said. \"As the graves we found were just below the turf, they are very exposed and would likely have been lost in time. Now we get a chance to excavate this small gravefield.\""

            "article_content": "On the night of August 10, 2022, five pilots on two separate commercial airline flights were wholly convinced they\u2019d documented proof of an Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP) over the Pacific Ocean. Pilots from both flights reported seeing odd lights zipping through the sky\u2014but the single incident they all witnessed turned out to be Starlink telecommunications satellites.\n\nIn recent years, pilots\u2014as well as the public\u2014have mistakenly identified these low-Earth orbit satellites as UAPs. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of 69 reports just from January 23\u2013April 27, 2023 that identify \u201cUFO-UAP,\u201d and according to one paper , more than a third of them could be Starlink satellites. Unfortunately, such mysterious sightings lead to pilot confusion and potential safety consequences because of the distraction and extra chatter about them over the airwaves.\n\nThe core issue with pilots misidentifying satellites as UAPs stems from the fact that pilots cannot access real-time data about satellite movements, leaving them unprepared to recognize strange lights in the sky. These satellites may appear to move in unexpected ways, based on their orientation, and they may also appear and disappear, since their solar arrays reflect sunlight at different angles when deployed, relative to the pilot\u2019s position in flight.\n\nStarlink satellites orbit about 342 miles above Earth, according to Starlink\u2019s website, and that places them lower than most other satellites, making them visible to our eyes as spots of light, no magnification needed. More than 6,000 Starlink satellites are currently circling Earth, and the SpaceX-owned company aims to eventually have 42,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit, which means pilots will need to have surefire methods for identifying them.\n\n\n\nGetty Images The passage of Starlink satellites is seen in the sky over southern Poland on November 1, 2024.\n\nFour scientists want to fill the information gap in this type of situation to prevent unnecessary aviation risk. Led by mechanical engineer Douglas J. Buettner of the University of Utah, the team devised a method to simulate the exact locations of satellites, and they proposed plans that would provide pilots with the information they need to quickly identify satellites. Their paper describing this work was accepted at the 2024 International Academy of Astronautics Conference on Space Situational Awareness (ICSSA).\n\nTo shed some light on what the five pilots saw, the scientists conducted an \u201castrometric analysis\u201d of their reports, using two cell phone photos and a video the pilots had taken of \u201can unrecognized and possibly anomalous phenomenon,\u201d according to the paper. To corroborate the data, researchers looked up Starlink\u2019s records, noting that the visual line the satellites created in the sky\u2014called a \u201ctrain\u201d of satellites\u2014launched that same day. The team also used data from the flight, including photographs taken in the cockpit. Using these pieces of information and an orbital mechanics software tool, they were able to reconstruct the August 10 cockpit view. It showed Starlink satellites matching both the time and place of the sighting.\n\nTheir analysis used a technique called \u201cray-traced rendering\u201d of the view from the pilots\u2019 cockpit, which provided a more visual simulation of exactly where the pilots saw the satellites through their cockpit windows, according to the paper. The simulation experiments indicated that the satellites\u2019 solar arrays must have been deployed, likely making them glint brightly enough for the pilots in both aircraft to notice them. \u201cIn the implementation of our approach, we were able to closely match the apparent speed in degrees per second traveled by the object between the two photographs taken by one of the pilots,\u201d the scientists wrote.\n\nThe team hopes that their work demonstrates a plan that could plausibly \u201cwarn aviators and the public about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations,\u201d and therefore support aviation safety, they wrote. In the future, it\u2019s worth studying how the deployment of a satellite\u2014as well as its surface materials\u2014affects the way it reflects sunlight, the paper adds. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said on X that the satellite orientation could be adjusted to minimize solar reflection during astronomical experiments, though the team\u2019s paper does not specifically address this possibility.\n\nThe authors do suggest various procedures and technologies that aircraft could deploy to support accurate UAP identification. For example, pilots should be allowed to \u201croutinely provide photographic evidence from either an automated system when they are busy with safety critical aircraft operations, or using cell phones when they are not allowed,\u201d to greatly improve UAP analysis.\n\nSatellite operators should also provide information about satellite movements\u2014such as orientation, orbit location, and deployment timelines\u2014to support more accurate and detailed models, the scientists write. Finally, they suggest a way for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reduce in-flight risks due to pilots trying to determine the source of a UAP. Air traffic controllers could have access to a satellite-modeling system that would enable them to anticipate satellite sightings and alert the pilots when necessary. \u201cWe envision this as a collaborative effort between the satellite\u2019s owners (in this case SpaceX/Starlink), the FAA, NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Space Force,\u201d the authors note.\n\nAs for people on the ground, anyone can find Starlink in the sky. Look up on a clear, dark night, and if you see a white light or \u201ctrain\u201d of lights moving across the sky, go to FindStarlink.com. You can search for your time and location and determine if what you see is indeed Starlink satellites."
