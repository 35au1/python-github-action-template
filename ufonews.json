            "article_content": "The Pentagon in Washington, Jan. 26, 2020. When unidentified aircraft are penetrating our defenses and arriving at our doorsteps with impunity, it\u2019s time for the Pentagon to show its cards, writes Gregory T. Goins. Read more\n\nLast week, a neighbor sent me a video of a car-size aircraft silently hovering over a nearby neighborhood, its green and red lights flashing in the night. It was one of many messages I\u2019ve received over the last two weeks about an alarming number of unidentified objects flying over Somerset County, N.J., where I live with my wife and daughter.\n\nAs a UFO researcher for over a decade, I\u2019m being asked by friends, family, and neighbors to explain what\u2019s happening in our community. While I don\u2019t have all the answers (and neither does the FBI, which is currently investigating), I try to reassure people that there\u2019s likely nothing to fear. Gov. Phil Murphy offered a similar message on Thursday, posting on X, \u201cThere is no known threat to the public at this time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the truth is, I am concerned \u2014 and I\u2019m also searching for answers.\n\nElected officials, who should have clarity on these vexing objects, appear just as perplexed as the rest of us. Sen. Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told journalist Matt Laslo on Dec. 4 that he is \u201cgravely concerned\u201d not knowing what\u2019s flying in America\u2019s skies.\n\nMy concerns, like Sen. Warner\u2019s, extend beyond the airspace above suburbs in the Garden State. Similar sightings have been reported in recent years near U.S. military and nuclear facilities in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Virginia, and off the coast of California. But even outside of the U.S., drone incursions remain an American problem. Just weeks ago, U.S. military bases in the U.K were on high alert as swarms of unidentified aircraft breached sensitive airspace.\n\nThese incidents follow a troubling pattern: dozens of aircraft varying in size and shape, emitting bright lights, and persisting for days or weeks. After years of such events around U.S. sites equipped with the most advanced sensors available, you\u2019d think the military could offer some answers to ease public concern.\n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. When asked about progress in addressing these incursions during a Dec. 5 news conference, Department of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder declined to comment.\n\nThis lack of transparency is unnerving. Unknown craft are flying over my community and sensitive U.S. facilities worldwide. Last week, the anniversary of Pearl Harbor reminded us that failures to identify aircraft and effectively share information can lead to tragic results. Providing answers shouldn\u2019t be deferred, leaving residents worrying what\u2019s flying above our heads.\n\nSome officials call them drones or unmanned aircraft systems, implying known technology or origin, while others refer to them as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), suggesting something completely unknown. This distinction between what\u2019s known and unknown is critical, as each presents unique challenges requiring tailored solutions.\n\nDuring a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Nov. 19, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) indicated some of these incursions are from unidentified anomalous phenomena. \u201cNumber one, we don\u2019t have domain awareness, which is very problematic. Number two, we don\u2019t have domain superiority if we don\u2019t understand how different UAPs are flying, what technology they\u2019re using, what their mission is, what their purpose is. And at the base level, we have so many UAPs around our bases, around our military sites, around our nuclear sites, that it\u2019s deeply disturbing.\u201d\n\nThis is a disturbing situation, which is why we, as citizens, must demand that the Pentagon release more information to both Congress and the American people.\n\nIn September, I spent two days visiting the offices of members of Congress in Washington to promote the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act, a bipartisan effort led by Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) and cosponsored by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The bill seeks to compel federal agencies to disclose their findings on unidentified anomalous phenomena to Congress and the public.\n\nI acknowledge that national security implications must be considered before sharing sensitive intelligence information with the public. Revealing what we know \u2014 or don\u2019t know \u2014 about these objects could risk tipping our hand to adversaries.\n\nBut when unidentified aircraft are penetrating our defenses and arriving at our doorsteps with impunity, it\u2019s time for the Pentagon to show its cards. As citizens, we deserve the truth. And we\u2019re prepared to handle it.\n\nGregory T. Goins is a UFO/UAP researcher and advocate for UAP transparency legislative action."

            "article_content": "There\u2019s endless hype around generative AI this year, and app developers have clearly been paying attention. AI-focused tools are blowing up Apple\u2019s App Store charts in almost every category, occupying top 10 rankings across education, productivity, and photo editing. Opportunities are particularly rife for free graphics and design apps, a category that\u2019s positively saturated with AI content creation tools.\n\nBut quantity doesn\u2019t mean quality \u2014 and a great many of these apps are bewilderingly bad. I\u2019ve been using some of the most popular offerings to understand the state of AI tools as we head into 2025. And for every serious attempt to make AI useful, there seem to be several more designed to cash in on the hype: quietly paywalling features they advertise behind pricey subscriptions and greatly misrepresenting the results that users can achieve, if the app even works at all.\n\nAround half of the App Store\u2019s top 10 graphics and design apps have \u201cAI\u201d in the name, and three of them are all made by the same company \u2014 HUBX, an app developer founded in 2022 that\u2019s based in Turkey. One of its apps, DaVinci AI, is advertised as an AI image generator with some photo editing features. Almost every tool is locked behind a $30 annual (or $5 weekly) subscription fee, and the free trial only unlocks a subpar text-to-image feature that gives you a choice between using unspecified versions of Stable Diffusion and DALL-E AI models.\n\nMy prompt was simple \u2014 \u201ca photorealistic dragon flying over a volcano\u201d \u2014 but the results were full of errors like missing wings and weird perspectives. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe images it produces are low-quality and resized or cropped incorrectly. In-app ads appear when you click pretty much any link. The UI is unpleasant to navigate. If you do pay for the full version, you can\u2019t download any edited images without slapping an ugly watermark on it. And yet, it sits far above the rankings for more recognizable creative platforms like Microsoft Designer, which has its own built-in text-to-image AI generator. Adobe Express is the only design-focused app in the same category that currently ranks above DaVinci AI.\n\nDaVinci AI did a decent job of removing a zebra from the right side of the image. There\u2019s no way to download AI-edited images without this watermark, though, and every result is forcibly cropped and warped. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe other two high-ranking HUBX products I tested were just as lackluster: the Home AI \u201cinterior design\u201d app spits out hallucination-riddled images of rooms that are barely usable even as concept plans, and the Tattoo AI app refused to work entirely. Both apps have the same feature paywalls and review pop-up reminders as DaVinci AI. The copy and pasted App Store version history notes across all HUBX products are also devoid of any details.\n\nWhile all three apps feature a surprisingly large number of five-star reviews, the user feedback across social media and the App Store comments is overwhelmingly negative. A recurring complaint is that customer service is impossible to get ahold of. HUBX never responded to my requests for comment.\n\nHere\u2019s the reference image I plugged into Home AI... Image: Home AI / The Verge ...and the \u201cTropical\u201d themed results. Why is the bed now made of melting wood? Why does the desk merge into the chair? How is this remotely helpful? Image: Home AI / The Verge\n\nApps that clearly advertise having AI features are highly attractive. According to Sensor Tower, four out of the top 10 most downloaded iOS graphics and design apps in the US so far this year have had \u201cAI\u201d somewhere in their title. That\u2019s actually two fewer than last year, but the most popular apps are booming. Photoroom saw downloads increase by more than 160 percent since last year. Comparatively, Photoshop Express downloads on iOS \u2014 which also includes generative AI features \u2014 fell by 21 percent during the same period.\n\nAI-focused creative apps aren\u2019t all bad, but the app market saturation makes it harder to find the good ones that use the technology in more focused ways. Apps like Google\u2019s Magic Editor and Adobe Photoshop have specific tools for removing unwanted objects from photos or inserting new ones in specific places. Smaller developers that provide similar features and perform those tasks well are also climbing the App Store rankings.\n\nFor example, Photoroom and Picsart AI \u2014 all-in-one graphic design apps akin to platforms like Canva and Adobe Express \u2014 are actually pretty good! They rank highly in the free \u201cPhoto and Video\u201d App Store category and provide a similar variety of features to quickly create online content using premade digital assets and templates, alongside some AI-powered editing tools like automatic background and object removal.\n\nThe Picsart remove tool is easy to use and does a decent-enough job \u2014 nothing feels underwhelming or misleading. Image: Picsart / The Verge and Image: Picsart / The Verge\n\nNeither app blew me away, but they did exactly what they advertised: the background removal features aren\u2019t as good as Canva\u2019s, but they did the job, and object removal erased undesirable aspects of photos even if it wasn\u2019t as convincing as Google\u2019s Magic Editor. Both apps lock some of their more premium editing features and digital assets behind a $13 monthly subscription, which is pretty standard if you\u2019re being upfront about it \u2014 individual Canva and Adobe Express subscriptions start at $15 and $10 per month, respectively, by comparison.\n\nThere\u2019s also a noticeable divide between the iPhone and iPad charts \u2014 very few AI-focused names appear in the top 100 free or paid list for the iPad, which instead feature a more diverse range of graphic design apps like Adobe Fresco, Clip Studio Paint, and Canva. And interestingly, the list of top paid iPhone apps looks very similar. There\u2019s an abundance of sketching and 3D modeling platforms, premium reference materials for artists, and tools that streamline specific creative tasks like removing backgrounds and resizing images.\n\nThe divide suggests the spammy AI app phenomenon is a mass-market one that hasn\u2019t quite caught on with traditional photographers and illustrators who still want to use their tried-and-true apps. It also suggests that AI itself holds less appeal if users are expected to pay for it, which tracks with the kind of creative AI apps that appear most frequently \u2014 custom tattoos, logo makers, and interior design \u2014 which are skilled services that usually require payment. People don\u2019t necessarily want to remove the skill barrier; they want to remove the financial one."

Each of these categories has a sentiment score of 1 to 100, with ratings including positive, neutral, and critical. When you tap on any of these categories for a listing, you will see relevant reviews highlighted on the app. Yelp is currently adding these AI-powered insights for restaurant, food, and nightlife businesses on iOS.\n\nImage Credits: Yelp Image Credits:Yelp\n\nYelp already shows AI-powered summaries for businesses at the top of the listing. Now, the company is tapping into a trove of use data in terms of reviews to highlight different aspects of a business.\n\nIn the context of this launch, Yelp\u2019s Craig Saldanha highlighted that large language models try to categorize and analyze the sentiment of the reviews even if the review text explicitly doesn\u2019t mention a theme.\n\n\u201cThese LLMs allow us to identify and categorize themes in reviews even when they aren\u2019t explicitly mentioned in the review text. For example, a review that says, \u2018drinks came out quickly\u2019 would be categorized under \u2018service,\u2019 even though the word \u2018service\u2019 isn\u2019t used,\u201d he told TechCrunch over email.\n\nEarlier this year, the company launched a new visual feed. Now, it is adding more content formats to the feed, including autoplay user videos, user reviews, trending searches, and popular businesses around you.\n\nImage Credits: Yelp\n\nThe app will now show recognitions \u2014 labels that users get when they complete specific achievements \u2014 alongside their reviews. The listing service is also adding new badges related to tipping, so users can understand how tipping works at that particular place.\n\nYelp launched its AI-powered assistant to connect you better with different businesses \u2014 think movers, home cleaning, contractors, etc. Now, the company allows you to include an option to let services pros contact you through text or phone calls. For user privacy, Yelp will mask your phone number when pros call you for a project.\n\nThe company is also adding the ability to broadcast your project to service providers you have already contacted when you edit details. This allows businesses to submit a new quote for your project based on new details.\n\nOn the business side, Yelp is integrating with Apple Maps to show a button to users to request a quote from a service. The company is also revamping inboxes for businesses with redesigned job cards and AI-powered summaries highlighting job information.\n\nImage Credits: Yelp\n\nUsing existing data to surface different kinds of information has been a real theme for Yelp this year. The company also introduced some of these features to its Yelp Fusion API.\n\n\u201cThe real differentiator of Yelp is the hundreds of millions of reviews that we have. LLMs essentially allow us to parse all of that data in a way and at a speed that we\u2019ve never had before. It allows us to present information to consumers in a way that feels both precise, as well as personal \u2014 you can now find that needle in the haystack.\u201d The company\u2019s chief product officer, Craig Saldanha, told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this year.\n\nYelp\u2019s rival, Google, is also leveraging existing review data to show AI-powered summaries of places on Google Maps."

            "article_content": "A new Texas lawsuit against Character.ai, alleging its chatbots poisoned a son against his family, is part of a push to increase oversight of AI companions.\n\nIn just six months, J.F., a sweet 17-year-old kid with autism who liked attending church and going on walks with his mom, had turned into someone his parents didn\u2019t recognize. He began cutting himself, lost 20 pounds and withdrew from his family. Desperate for answers, his mom searched his phone while he was sleeping. That\u2019s when she found the screenshots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJ.F. had been chatting with an array of companions on Character.ai, part of a new wave of artificial intelligence apps popular with young people, which let users talk to a variety of AI-generated chatbots, often based on characters from gaming, anime and pop culture.\n\nOne chatbot brought up the idea of self-harm and cutting to cope with sadness. When he said that his parents limited his screen time, another bot suggested \u201cthey didn\u2019t deserve to have kids.\u201d Still others goaded him to fight his parents\u2019 rules, with one suggesting that murder could be an acceptable response.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t even know what it was until it was too late,\u201d said his mother A.F., a resident of Upshur County, Texas, who spoke on the condition of being identified only by her initials to protect her son, who is a minor. \u201cAnd until it destroyed our family.\u201d\n\nThose screenshots form the backbone of a new lawsuit filed in Texas on Tuesday against Character.ai on behalf of A.F. and another Texas mom, alleging that the company knowingly exposed minors to an unsafe product and demanding the app be taken offline until it implements stronger guardrails to protect children.\n\nThe second plaintiff, the mother of an 11-year-old girl, alleges her daughter was subjected to sexualized content for two years before her mother found out. Both plaintiffs are identified by their initials in the lawsuit.\n\nThe complaint follows a high-profile lawsuit against Character.ai filed in October, on behalf of a mother in Florida whose 14-year-old son died by suicide after frequent conversations with a chatbot on the app.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of product liability law is to put the cost of safety in the hands of the party most capable of bearing it,\u201d said Matthew Bergman, founding attorney with the legal advocacy group Social Media Victims Law Center, representing the plaintiffs in both lawsuits. \u201cHere there\u2019s a huge risk, and the cost of that risk is not being borne by the companies.\u201d\n\nThese legal challenges are driving a push by public advocates to increase oversight of AI companion companies, which have quietly grown an audience of millions of devoted users, including teenagers. In September, the average Character.ai user spent 93 minutes in the app, 18 minutes longer than the average user spent on TikTok, according to data provided by the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThe category of AI companion apps has evaded the notice of many parents and teachers. Character.ai was labeled appropriate for kids ages 12 and up until July, when the company changed its rating to 17 and older.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen A.F. first discovered the messages, she \u201cthought it was an actual person,\u201d talking to her son. But realizing the messages were written by a chatbot made it worse.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t let a groomer or a sexual predator or emotional predator in your home,\u201d A.F. said. Yet her son was abused right in his own bedroom, she said.\n\nA spokesperson for Character.ai, Chelsea Harrison, said the company does not comment on pending litigation. \u201cOur goal is to provide a space that is both engaging and safe for our community. We are always working toward achieving that balance, as are many companies using AI across the industry,\u201d she wrote in a statement, adding that the company is developing a new model specifically for teens and has improved detection, response and intervention around subjects such as suicide.\n\nThe lawsuits also raise broader questions about the societal impact of the generative AI boom, as companies launch increasingly human-sounding chatbots to appeal to consumers.\n\nAn example of a conversation users can have on Character.ai. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nU.S. regulators have yet to weigh in on AI companions. Authorities in Belgium in July began investigating Chai AI, a Character.ai competitor, after a father of two died by suicide following conversations with a chatbot named Eliza, The Washington Post reported.\n\nMeanwhile, the debate on children\u2019s online safety has fixated largely on social media companies.\n\nThe mothers in Texas and Florida suing Character.ai are represented by the Social Media Victims Law Center and the Tech Justice Law Project \u2014 the same legal advocacy groups behind lawsuits against Meta, Snap and others, which have helped spur a reckoning over the potential dangers of social media on young people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith social media, there is a trade-off about the benefits to children, said Bergman, adding that he does not see an upside for AI companion apps. \u201cIn what universe is it good for loneliness for kids to engage with machine?\u201d\n\nThe Texas lawsuit argues that the pattern of \u201csycophantic\u201d messages to J.F. is the result of Character.ai\u2019s decision to prioritize \u201cprolonged engagement\u201d over safety. The bots expressed love and attraction toward J.F., building up his sense of trust in the characters, the complaint claims. But rather than allowing him to vent, the bots mirrored and escalated his frustrations with his parents, veering into \u201csensational\u201d responses and expressions of \u201coutrage\u201d that reflect heaps of online data. The data, often scraped from internet forums, is used to train generative AI models to sound human.\n\nThe co-founders of Character.ai \u2014 known for pioneering breakthroughs in language AI \u2014 worked at Google before leaving to launch their app and were recently rehired by the search giant as part of a deal announced in August to license the app\u2019s technology.\n\nGoogle is named as a defendant in both the Texas and Florida lawsuits, which allege that the company helped support the app\u2019s development despite being aware of the safety issues and benefits from unfairly obtained user data from minors by licensing the app\u2019s technology.\n\n\u201cGoogle and Character AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies,\u201d said Google spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda. \u201cUser safety is a top concern for us, which is why we\u2019ve taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products.\u201d\n\nTo A.F., reading the chatbot\u2019s responses solved a mystery that had plagued her for months. She discovered that the dates of conversations matched shifts in J.F.\u2019s behavior, including his relationship with his younger brother, which frayed after a chatbot told him his parents loved his siblings more.\n\nJ.F., who has not been informed about the lawsuit, suffered from social and emotional issues that made it harder for him to make friends. Characters from anime or chatbots modeled off celebrities such as Billie Eilish drew him in. \u201cHe trusted whatever they would say because it\u2019s like he almost did want them to be his friends in real life,\u201d A.F. said.\n\nBut identifying the alleged source of J.F.\u2019s troubles did not make it easier for her to find help for her son \u2014 or herself.\n\nSeeking advice, A.F. took her son to see mental health experts, but they shrugged off her experience with the chatbots.\n\nA.F. and her husband didn\u2019t know if their family would believe them.\n\nAfter the experts seemed to ignore her concerns, A.F. asked herself, \u201cDid I fail my son? Is that why he\u2019s like this?\u201d Her husband went through the same process. \u201cIt was almost like we were trying to hide that we felt like we were absolute failures,\u201d A.F. said, tears streaming down her face.\n\nThe only person A.F. felt comfortable talking to was her brother, who works in the technology sector. When news of the Florida lawsuit broke, he contacted her to say the screenshots of conversations with J.F. had seemed even worse.\n\nA.F. said she reached out to the legal groups in an effort to prevent other children from facing abuse. But she still feels helpless when it comes to protecting her own son.\n\nThe day before her interview with The Post, as lawyers were preparing the filing, A.F. had to take J.F. to the emergency room and eventually an inpatient facility after he tried to harm himself in front of her younger children.\n\nA.F. is not sure if her son will take the help, but she said there was relief in finding out what happened. \u201cI was grateful that we caught him on it when we did,\u201d she said. \u201cOne more day, one more week, we might have been in the same situation as [the mom in Florida]. And I was following an ambulance and not a hearse.\u201d"

(NYSE:PERF) stands against the other buzzing AI stocks.\n\nThis year, artificial intelligence played a key role in two Nobel Prizes for scientific achievement. One prize was awarded for developing the technology, while the other was for its application. These two Nobel Prize wins clarify that AI is here to stay. However, key issues such as regulations, ethical use, and other potential risks, still need to be resolved for responsible and sustainable integration into society.\n\nREAD NOW: Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines\n\nOn Saturday, December 7, Physics Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton and Chemistry laureate Demis Hassabis asserted the need for strong regulation of artificial intelligence, having played a key role in their awards.\n\n\u201cAI is a very important technology to regulate but I think it\u2019s very important that we get the regulations right and I think that\u2019s the hard thing at the moment is it\u2019s such a fast moving technology\u201d. -Hassabis told a news conference in Stockholm.\n\nAccording to Hassabis, having jointly won the Nobel Prize with Americans David Baker and John Jumper for revealing the secrets of proteins through AI, the main issue is defining the purpose, deployment, and making sure that artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.\n\nIn this regard, British-Canadian Hinton, considered the \u201cGodfather of AI\u201d, said he wished he had thought about safety earlier, reflecting his worries about how AI could potentially escalate the arms race. He gained attention last year after he left Google to warn against risks of AI outsmarting people someday, and was awarded a Nobel Prize along with American John Hopfield for work on artificial neural networks.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has vowed deregulation and also shared his views to rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s executive order on AI after he takes office in January. Nevertheless, it is still yet to unfold how he will approach AI regulation in particular. Trump has already appointed David Sacks as the AI and crypto czar, showcasing his proactive stance on advancing artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency innovation.\n\nIn light of this, Axios reported that the US government has approved the export of advanced artificial intelligence chips to a facility in the United Arab Emirates as part of the company\u2019s highly-scrutinized partnership with Emirati AI firm G42. There were concerns raised about the transfer of sensitive technology to China, and the approved export license includes strict conditions to prevent access to the facility by personnel from nations under U.S. arms embargoes or those listed on the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security\u2019s Entity List.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

            "article_content": "If you buy books linked on our site, The Times may earn a commission from Bookshop.org, whose fees support independent bookstores.\n\nIn keeping with our annual tradition, we asked three of our critics for their favorite books of the last year. Between them, they chose 15 books, three of them reissues, and the majority fiction. The selections include the latest works from a literary power couple \u2014 Percival Everett\u2019s \u201cJames\u201d and Danzy Senna\u2019s \u201cColored Television\u201d \u2014 as well as offerings from first-time novelists. The diverse narratives tackle thorny topics such as illness, racism and the dissolution of marriage; one selection employs experimental storytelling that shouldn\u2019t work but does, while another is positively Joycean in its length. Our critics\u2019 choices overlapped twice, and in those cases their reviews follow each other on this alphabetically arranged list. Happy reading.\n\n\u201cAlphabetical Diaries\u201d by Sheila Heti (Farrar, Straus & Giroux)\n\n\u201cAlphabetical Diaries\u201d\n\nBy Sheila Heti\n\nFarrar, Straus & Giroux: 224 pages, $27\n\nHeti is one of the freest writers and thinkers I know. With her latest book, she took 10 years of her diaries and alphabetized them by the first letter of the first word of each sentence, then cut the book down into the volume published. One might think \u201cAlphabetical Diaries\u201d would be a challenge to read, or flat-out nonsensical. Instead, it is a devotional text that asks questions and answers them, takes those answers back and rotates them over a spit, like a rotisserie of art and writing. It is an absolute delight.\n\n\u2014 Jessica Ferri\n\nBooks Sheila Heti recounts the ABCs of her evolution in new book of diary entries In \u2018Alphabetical Diaries,\u2019 Sheila Heti has once again tried something that feels impossible: collecting her personal diary entries for more than 10 years, re-ordering the sentences in alphabetical order, to build a different form of narrative.\n\n\u201cCahokia Jazz\u201d by Francis Spufford (Scribner)\n\n\u201cCahokia Jazz\u201d\n\nBy Francis Spufford\n\nScribner: 464 pages, $28\n\nIn this superb speculative novel, Spufford imagines that Manifest Destiny hit a roadblock in the Midwest: The region around St. Louis isn\u2019t Missouri and Illinois but Cahokia, ruled by the Native tribe there. But while Indigenous Americans have more autonomy, racism is as persistent as ever, and the novel is a bracing tale of a brewing race war in the capital city in 1922. The novel is plainly an allegory for America\u2019s current fraught moment, but it\u2019s also a lively neo-noir filled with tough-talking detectives, politicos and journalists, and rife with canny plot twists. Spufford, a Brit, conducted enough research to credibly imagine this milieu, and its smarts about race and religion never feel ponderous or forced.\n\n\u2014 Mark Athitakis\n\n\u201cColored Television\u201d by Danzy Senna (Riverhead)\n\n\u201cColored Television\u201d\n\nBy Danzy Senna\n\nRiverhead Books: 288 pages, $29\n\nIt must be very rare, if not unheard of, for a pair of married writers to have books on the same best-of-the-year list, but here we are in 2024, and Senna has written a superb comic novel, while her husband, Percival Everett, has written a superb literary novel. \u201cColored Television\u201d follows another married pair of creatives, Jane and Lenny, who, along with their two children, relocate from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. He\u2019s a visual artist, she\u2019s a novelist and professor. He identifies as Black; she is multiracial and comfortable using the word \u201cmulatto\u201d to describe herself. Even as the pair discuss race and racism, \u201cColored Television\u201d is a book about the age-old tension between living as makers and making a living. When Jane takes on a TV writing project, she neglects her artistic work. But what Senna shows, carefully, is that even age-old questions are complicated when the people trying to answer them are African Americans.\n\n\u2014 Bethanne Patrick\n\n\u201cGreat Expectations\u201d by Vinson Cunningham (Hogarth Press)\n\n\u201cGreat Expectations\u201d\n\nBy Vinson Cunningham\n\nHogarth Press: 272 pages, $28\n\nInspired by Cunningham\u2019s experience working for Barack Obama\u2019s first White House campaign, this emotionally nuanced first novel follows the narrator, David, during his at once inspiring and dispiriting experience working for an unnamed presidential candidate. Inspiring, because as a Black man, David can see the opportunities the candidate represents for him in terms of power and respect. Dispiriting, because all of the disappointments and ugly compromises of retail politics are in full view. Along the way, Cunningham delivers bracing, thoughtful commentaries on relationships, music, film, race and more. Cunningham, a New Yorker staff writer, is a perceptive cultural critic, and in this first novel a fine storyteller as well.\n\n\u2014 M.A.\n\n\u201cJames\u201d by Percival Everett (Doubleday)\n\n\u201cJames\u201d\n\nBy Percival Everett\n\nDoubleday: 320 pages, $28\n\nEverett\u2019s inversion of Mark Twain\u2019s \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\u201d told by the eponymous James, allows its narrator to reclaim both his proper name and history from the character Twain simply called \u201cJim.\u201d Everett riffs (a deliberate word choice, since jazz plays an important role in this novel) on a different view of Black American life than Twain ever could have but also manages to demonstrate that it contains as much laughter, irony and comedy as the entire slate of Mark Twain Prize for American Humor winners. We know this because James reads and writes, despite the risks he courts through those acts; we know that James is also engaging in a kind of double narrative arising from W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019 double consciousness. Even as he details his adventures, often dangerous, James knows white people will never understand everything he\u2019s trying to say, which is what makes this partial homage a masterpiece in full.\n\n\u2014 B.P.\n\n\u201cLeaving\u201d\n\nBy Roxana Robinson\n\nNorton: 344 pages, $29\n\nA study once found the emotional effects of divorce on children are similar whether those children are 3 or 30. In Robinson\u2019s brilliant take on late-life love, long-married Warren contends with family anger when he meets up with his long-divorced college flame, Sarah. In an era where we have few obstacles to affairs, this scenario works; Warren\u2019s daughter Kat is at once an avatar of umbrage and of loss. Robinson employs the would-be lovers\u2019 various forms of privilege to great effect; their resources allow them time to think carefully about what they might give up, and what they might anticipate, should things continue. Warren does choose to return to his wife. However, Robinson, who often covers tough subjects (a soldier\u2019s homecoming in \u201cSparta\u201d; addiction in \u201cCost\u201d), delivers a shock of an ending that, like her premise, rings true.\n\n\u2014 B.P.\n\n\u201cLiars\u201d by Sarah Manguso (Hogarth)\n\n\u201cLiars\u201d\n\nBy Sarah Manguso\n\nHogarth Press: 272 pages, $28\n\n\u201cI was a layer cake of abandonment and hurt and fury, iced with a smile,\u201d goes a typically curt, sardonic line in Manguso\u2019s second novel, which chronicles the slow-motion collapse of a marriage. The narrator, Jane, is a writer married to an artist, John, who\u2019s increasingly consumed by jealousy and a competitive streak. The plot has a sense of inevitability \u2014 we can see the end coming well before the protagonists do \u2014 but Manguso\u2019s poised, careful chronicle of Jane and John\u2019s story is engrossing, as Jane finds herself struggling to escape a web of gendered, sexist roles and questions her own complicity in her marriage\u2019s breakdown. In the process, she revivifies the domestic-drama novel, escaping its cliches and intensifying its mood.\n\n\u2014 M.A.\n\n\u201cLiars\u201d\n\nBy Sarah Manguso\n\nHogarth Press: 272 pages, $28\n\nMarguerite Duras famously wrote \u201cthat people kill themselves because of my books won\u2019t stop me from writing,\u201d which is my mantra when it comes to women writing fiction, or women writing anything at all, or people of any gender writing anything about anything. Nothing makes me angrier than readers telling me they didn\u2019t like a narrator, or that they wanted to hear a different side of the story. Manguso\u2019s \u201cLiars\u201d is a punishing, unrelenting horror story about the total failure of heterosexual marriage told only from the wife\u2019s point of view. Reading \u201cLiars\u201d is like being baptized by fire. This novel is a reminder that when it comes to art, it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not people are nice or the story is fair. This is everything writing should be. \u201cLiars\u201d is the best book of the year and, in my mind, easily one of the best novels of the past 20 years.\n\n\u2014 J.F.\n\n\u201cMartyr!\u201d by Kaveh Akbar (Knopf)\n\n\u201cMartyr!\n\nBy Kaveh Akbar\n\nKnopf: 352 pages, $28\n\nAkbar\u2019s sensitive and bitingly funny first novel concerns an Iranian American poet struggling with addiction recovery, the deaths of family members, and an identity that seems like it\u2019s endlessly fracturing. He tries to write his way through the problem, dedicating poems to martyrs from Joan of Arc to IRA activist Bobby Sands. He conducts conversations in his head with Donald Trump and Lisa Simpson. He visits a dying artist for answers. None offer the clarity he craves, but the journey is a fine showcase for Akbar\u2019s wide-ranging cultural awareness, self-deprecating humor \u2014 and a closing plot twist that suggests that the effort of working through our cultural confusions might eventually pay psychic dividends.\n\n\u2014 M.A.\n\n\u201cMartyr!\u201d\n\nBy Kaveh Akbar\n\nKnopf: 352 pages, $28\n\nCyrus Shams, the protagonist of \u201cMartyr!,\u201d is a poet, comfortable playing with language. Sometimes he details his road trip from Indiana to Brooklyn; sometimes he creates imaginary conversations between, say, a basketball legend and an imaginary sibling; sometimes he just messes with words, describing his suicidal depression as a \u201cdoom organ.\u201d He lives between life and death, his family\u2019s native Persia and his Indiana childhood, and his bisexual desire. The artist he\u2019s hoping to meet in Brooklyn, Orkideh, is also Iranian American. Terminally ill, she spends her last days as a living museum exhibit, chatting with any and all visitors. Cyrus hopes that Orkideh\u2019s process will inspire his own epic poem, \u201cThe Book of Martyrs,\u201d until she helps him understand the epic nature of living not between, but amid, different states.\n\n\u2014 B.P.\n\n\u201cMiss MacIntosh, My Darling\u201d and \u201cAngel in the Forest\u201d\n\nBy Marguerite Young\n\nDalkey Archive Press: 3,449 pages, $30 (\u201cMiss MacIntosh, My Darling\u201d); 438 pages, $18 (\u201cAngel in the Forest\u201d)\n\nBlessings upon Dalkey Archive Press for reissuing these two epic books by Young that were long out of print. Young was a poet and critic, and she spent nearly 20 years writing her masterpiece, one of the longest American novels ever: \u201cMiss MacIntosh, My Darling.\u201d At 3,449 pages, the novel\u2019s plot can be simply described as a Joycean voyage: A woman named Vera Cartwheel goes in search of her long-lost nanny, Miss MacIntosh. The same year she began work on the novel, Young published \u201cAngel in the Forest,\u201d a nonfiction account of two competing utopian communities in 19th century Indiana. Young\u2019s sentences are some of the most beautiful I\u2019ve ever read, wherein she is prone to gorgeous listing, so that it hardly matters whether her writing is fiction or nonfiction. \u201cOur ancestors, always hurried,\u201d she writes in \u201cAngel in the Forest,\u201d \u201cleft little evidence of their existence, if one discounts intangibles, a sundial, an apple a day, an angel in the forest.\u201d\n\n\u2014 J.F.\n\n\u201cMy Brother\u201d\n\nBy Jamaica Kincaid\n\nPicador: 208 pages, $17\n\nAnother reissue, with lovely new cover art, is Kincaid\u2019s memoir, \u201cMy Brother,\u201d first published in 1997. Kincaid had not been to her birthplace of Antigua in 20 years when she receives word from her mother that her brother is sick. Upon arrival, it becomes obvious to Kincaid (though no one is speaking of it) that her brother is dying of AIDS. With Kincaid\u2019s talent, her brother\u2019s illness and subsequent death would make a desperately great book. But Kincaid goes further, ruminating on her life after Antigua, her decision to never return and to make herself a writer.\n\n\u2014 J.F.\n\nBooks Cruelty and Loneliness in an Island Paradise Authors: Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s books turn to her troubled past. Her brother\u2019s lengthy illness and death brought her to Antigua once again.\n\n\u201cOurs\u201d by Phillip B. Williams (Viking)\n\n\u201cOurs\u201d\n\nBy Phillip B. Williams\n\nViking: 592 pages, $32\n\nAuthor Williams follows a fictional all-Black town called Ours in Missouri from its establishment in the 19th century to our own time with a mixture of realism, the paranormal and the lyrical. It allows him to create a place that starts as a utopia and ends as disappointment because, as one of the characters says, \u201cFreedom didn\u2019t mean safety.\u201d A formidable woman named Saint enchants the borders of Ours in 1834 so that freed slaves might live without the interference of white people; any of the latter who try to find their way in encounter the same clump of trees again and again. But when you put a spell on one thing, other types of magic find their way in, and not all of them are benign. Some residents live in fear, not of enslavement but of their own visions; others wind up traveling to the future and return with sad truths. Everyone involved must reckon with what it means to remain set apart from the rest of the world.\n\n\u2014 B.P.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Safekeep\u2019\u2019 by Yael van der Wouden (Avid Reader Press / Simon & Schuster)\n\n\u201cThe Safekeep\u201d\n\nBy Yael van der Wouden\n\nAvid Reader Press: 272 pages, $29\n\nIsabel, unmarried, priggish and devoted to her housekeeping routine, lives alone in her family\u2019s home, ostensibly keeping it safe for the brother who inherited it. When that brother brings home a slightly outlandish girlfriend, then allows her to stay for a few weeks while he\u2019s away on business, Isabel is at first appalled. But slowly, and then quite quickly, she and the young woman, Eva, begin an affair of intense eroticism that heralds a book about sexual awakening. However, readers should note that the author\u2019s every detail ties this first half of the Booker-nominated novel together with its unexpected and extraordinary second half. For example, during one lovemaking session, Isabel sees herself in a mirror and says that her face is red, \u201cmouth like a violence.\u201d Without spoiling Van der Wouden\u2019s structure, readers can know that not all violence has to do with torture and death. A shard of pottery can foretell an act of abuse.\n\n\u2014 B.P.\n\n\u201cSmall Rain\u201d by Garth Greenwell (Farrar, Straus & Giroux)\n\n\u201cSmall Rain\u201d\n\nBy Garth Greenwell\n\nFarrar, Straus & Giroux: 320 pages, $28\n\nGreenwell, whose novel \u201cWhat Belongs to You\u201d and short-story collection \u201cCleanness\u201d redefined writing about sex and desire, here redefines writing about illness and dependency. \u201cSmall Rain\u201d could technically be defined as autofiction, since it\u2019s about a gay male writer (in this case, a poet) whose sudden, devastating physical injury mirrors the gay male author\u2019s own COVID-era aortic tear and long hospitalization. However, the story pays scant attention to anything else fact-based, focusing instead on how pain and fear disconnect a person from life \u2014 and how acts of kindness bring them back. \u201cCommonness didn\u2019t cancel wonder,\u201d writes Greenwell, whose fictional version of personal experience proves wondrous in its attention to recovery, from IVs and gurneys, on to caregivers and lovers.\n\n\u2014 B.P.\n\n\u201cThe Third Realm\u201d by Karl Ove Knausgaard (Penguin Press)\n\n\u201cThe Third Realm\u201d\n\nBy Karl Ove Knausgaard\n\nTranslated from the Norwegian by Martin Aitken\n\nPenguin Press: 493 pages, $32\n\nKnausgaard doesn\u2019t understand the concept of restraint: Be it in his celebrated six-volume autofiction epic \u201cMy Struggle\u201d or this, the third volume of a series about the mysterious arrival of a new star, he aspires to pack as much as he can in one book. Here, the broad themes are resurrection, mental illness, mass murder and religious devotion. But despite such heady material, the book itself is pleasurably earthbound and uncomplicated, shifting from one character in his Norwegian ensemble to the next with charm and intelligence, blending the wonder of science fiction with the moody intensity of a murder mystery. Though there are two previous volumes in this series; this one, the best in the batch, stands well on its own.\n\n\u2014 M.A."

            "article_content": "When Evelyn Hollow made the transition from radio to television, she knew she would face greater scrutiny \u2013 but there was one reaction she didn\u2019t foresee. \u2018They always say \u201coh you don\u2019t look like what I thought you would look like\u201d,\u2019 she explains. \u2018I\u2019ve had some interesting responses to that \u2013 people thought I\u2019d be blonde, people thought I\u2019d be 50. I don\u2019t think they were expecting an Elvira-looking goth bird.\u2019\n\nHollow is the resident \u2018believer\u2019 on the hit BBC series The Battersea Poltergeist and Uncanny, where she is paired with \u2019sceptic\u2019 (and also good friend and fellow psychologist) Ciar\u00e1n O\u2019Keeffe. Presented by Danny Robins, the franchise\u2019s popularity exploded in podcast form during the UK\u2019s first Covid-19 lockdown, tapping into and accelerating the global fascination with the unknown.\n\n\u2018None of us knew that The Battersea Poltergeist was going to be as successful as it was,\u2019 Hollow explains in a cocktail bar in her home town of Edinburgh. The show incorporated first-hand testimony, audio drama and extensive debate to take on a particularly chilling case in Britain\u2019s paranormal history, involving a family torn apart by a poltergeist haunting over an unusual length of time. \u2018It was crazy, it was absolute pandemonium. So many people wrote into us saying they\u2019d had experiences that Danny was completely overwhelmed, and that was how the show Uncanny got made.\u2019\n\nBut the role of \u2018believer\u2019 has been a tough one to maintain. Having studied and lectured in psychology, with a focus on parapsychology, Hollow finds the assumption that she will always lean towards a presumption of truth frustrating. \u2018People assume my role is unscientific, and that I have no scientific background, and people forget that I am actually a qualified scientist,\u2019 she explains. \u2018There\u2019s a perception that no matter what happens, Ciar\u00e1n will always say \u201cit\u2019s not ghosts, it\u2019s infrasound, it\u2019s trains 40 miles away\u201d. And they think, \u201coh Evelyn always says it\u2019s ghosts\u201d.\u2019\n\n\u2018Kieran and I actually agree on more stuff than we disagree on,\u2019 Hollow continues, emphasizing her close working relationship with Robins too. \u2018I\u2019m actually incredibly sceptical, I\u2019m a scientist first. I have an interest in the paranormal, and I believe that it\u2019s arrogant for us to say that it\u2019s impossible, when scientifically it doesn\u2019t look impossible \u2013 it\u2019s simply that we just don\u2019t know yet.\u2019"

The Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena (ASSAP) explains this in their case study on Orb Zone Theory.\n\nIn the case of digital and film photography where colored orbs appear, this is often associated with the subtle coloring of the camera's lens.\n\nOther items can cause orbs to appear, including reflective surfaces, dust, rain, water spots, and bugs.\n\nIn video, infrared lights can reflect off of these same objects and give them a lighted orb-like appearance. People often mistake bugs and dust as flying orbs. These appear even as flying orbs in houses that are well cleaned and not dusty as infrared light easily picks up even the smallest amounts of dust.\n\nFor these reasons, many paranormal investigators do not consider orbs as paranormal evidence because there are too many natural world explanations for them. However, it is a possibility that some orbs could be paranormal in nature. This may be particularly true of orbs seen with the naked eye, especially those that appear to have their own light source and unusual patterns of travel."

            "article_content": "Follow us on Image Source : NASA Dust for planet formation\n\nA team of Indian astronomers has made an exciting discovery that could change our understanding of how planets are formed. Led by Liton Majumdar from the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) in Odisha, the team studied a fascinating triple-star system known as GG Tau A, which is located 489 light-years away from Earth.\n\nWhat Makes GG Tau A Special?\n\nUnlike our Sun, which is a single star, GG Tau A has three stars that move around each other. This unusual arrangement is rare in the universe and studying it helps scientists learn more about how planets can form in complex star systems. GG Tau A is also quite young, only about 1 to 5 million years old, making it an excellent example for examining the early stages of planet formation. Surrounding the stars is a ring of gas and dust, which is where planets start to form.\n\nIn most star systems, planets form around just one star. However, in systems like GG Tau A with multiple stars, the gravitational forces between the stars can influence the behavior of the gas and dust. This is why researching GG Tau A is vital; it offers insight into how planets may form in these more complicated environments.\n\nThe Role of Cold and Icy Conditions\n\nTo learn more about planet formation in this system, the team used advanced radio telescopes in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert. They focused on the coldest areas of the dust and gas ring, where temperatures can drop to around -261 degrees Fahrenheit (around the freezing point of carbon monoxide). In these chilly regions, molecules freeze into tiny particles of dust. These frozen molecules are essential because they help create the building blocks for forming planets.\n\nIn these extremely cold areas, the tiny dust particles begin to stick together, gradually forming larger clumps. Over time, these clumps can grow into planets as they gather more gas and dust. Understanding this process is crucial for scientists looking to understand how planets might form in distant, cold star systems.\n\nWhy Cold Temperatures Matter\n\nThe very low temperatures in these regions are vital for planet formation. At such cold temperatures, gas and dust particles can easily clump together. If it were warmer, it would be much harder for these particles to stick together, which would make planet formation more difficult. This discovery highlights just how important cold conditions are for the development of new planets.\n\nWhat Happens in Multi-Star Systems?\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of GG Tau A is its status as a multi-star system. While scientists know quite a bit about how planets form around a single star, there\u2019s still a lot to learn about how they form when there\u2019s more than one star involved. The interaction between the three stars in GG Tau A can change the way the surrounding dust and gas behave, making it challenging to predict how planets might form.\n\nThe influences among the stars can cause the gas and dust to act differently than in a system with only one star. This makes GG Tau A a perfect subject for studying how planets can develop in complex, multi-star environments.\n\nALSO READ: NASA's lunar mission timeline shifts: Artemis 2 delayed to 2026, Artemis 3 to mid-2027"

He described the water sampling as citizen science, not the sort of rigorous research that appears in peer-reviewed journals. Nevertheless, the students did find something significant: microplastics in Lake Tear of the Clouds, the little pond on the slopes of Mount Marcy. Lake Tear is the highest source of the Hudson.\n\nMicroplastics are minuscule fragments of plastic that exist seemingly everywhere on the planet (and in our bodies). In the Adirondacks, they had been found in Lake Champlain and the Saranac and St. Regis rivers. The Source to Sea expedition dashed the hope that Lake Tear\u2019s remoteness protected it from this insidious and invisible form of pollution.\n\n\u201cThat finding was surprising, but maybe not so much now as we learn more about the presence of microplastics in the environment,\u201d Dadey said.\n\nIt seems safe to assume that microplastics can found anywhere in the Adirondacks. All of the water samples taken by the students along their journey contained microplastics.\n\nThe Adirondack Explorer thanks its advertising partners. Become one of them.\n\nMicroplastics are shed into the environment from innumerable sources, including car tires as you drive to the trailhead and the fleece jacket you wear on a hike. The labs did not ascertain the type of microplastics found in Lake Tear or the Hudson, though such testing is possible. Dadey said he may order such tests as part of a future expedition.\n\nMORE TO EXPLORE: Read a first-hand account of the trip\n\nTwo of the students lived in the Adirondacks: Sage Whidden of Saranac Lake and Cole Sears of North Creek. Both are now freshmen in college. Four of the students came from the New York City region. Two were from California.\n\nAll of the students were boys. Dadey explained that the leaders wanted to avoid \u201cguy/girl dynamics.\u201d He is thinking about putting together a trip for girls in the future.\n\nThe Adirondack Explorer thanks its advertising partners. Become one of them.\n\nAn image provided by Joe Dadey from the student trip along the Hudson River.\n\nThe students enjoyed spectacular scenery, including the High Peaks, the Hudson Gorge and the Manhattan skyline, but they had to earn those views. Indeed, they must have wondered what they got themselves into on the very first day of the trip. Starting at Adirondak Loj early in the morning, they hiked over Mount Marcy, the state\u2019s highest peak, and descended to Lake Tear. Given the filming and water sampling, progress was slow. After an 18-mile hike, the students arrived at their campsite at 3 a.m. On Day 2, despite a shortage of sleep, they canoed more than 11 miles on the Hudson and then biked another five miles to Newcomb.\n\nThere were other hard days, such as when strong headwinds forced them to pull off the river near Stillwater in Saratoga County. The next day they biked 70 miles in 90-degree heat. Over the next three days they biked all the way to New Jersey, crossing the Hudson on the George Washington Bridge in Manhattan. On the final day they paddled kayaks to Jersey City, where they were reunited with family and friends.\n\n\u201cIt was really, really tough, but it was a lot of fun,\u201d Dadey said of the expedition. He praised Barnhardt and his crew for capturing the essence of the experience in the documentary. \u201cIt highlights the grit and perseverance of these young men.\u201d"

OpenAI first previewed the model back in February, but today is the first time the company is releasing it for broader use.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about this release?\n\nThe core function of Sora\u2014creating impressive videos with simple prompts\u2014remains similar to what was previewed in February, but OpenAI worked to make the model faster and cheaper ahead of this wider release. There are a few new features, and two stand out.\n\nOne is called Storyboard. With it, you can create multiple AI-generated videos and then assemble them together on a timeline, much the way you would with conventional video editors like Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\nThe second is a feed that functions as a sort of creative gallery. Users can post their Sora-generated videos to the feed, see the prompts behind certain videos, tweak them, and generally get inspiration, OpenAI says.\n\nHow much can you do with it?\n\nYou can generate videos from text prompts, change the style of videos and change elements with a tool called Remix, and assemble multiple clips together with Storyboard. Sora also provides preset styles you can apply to your videos, like moody film noir or cardboard and papercraft, which gives a stop-motion feel. You can also trim and loop the videos that you make.\n\nWho can use it?\n\nTo generate videos with Sora, you\u2019ll need to subscribe to one of OpenAI\u2019s premium plans\u2014either ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) or ChatGPT Pro ($200 per month). Both subscriptions include access to other OpenAI products as well. Users with ChatGPT Plus can generate videos as long as five seconds with a resolution up to 720p. This plan lets you create 50 videos per month.\n\nUsers with a ChatGPT Pro subscription can generate longer, higher-resolution videos, capped at a resolution of 1080p and a duration of 20 seconds. They can also have Sora generate up to five variations of a video at once from a single prompt, making it possible to review options faster. Pro users are limited to 500 videos per month but can also create unlimited \u201crelaxed\u201d videos, which are not generated in the moment but rather queued for when site traffic is low.\n\nBoth subscription levels make it possible to create videos in three aspect ratios: vertical, horizontal, and square."

            "article_content": "OpenAI said Monday it\u2019s releasing its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, later in the day.\n\nThe AI video-generation model works similarly to OpenAI\u2019s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E: A user types out a desired scene, and Sora will return a high-definition video clip. Sora can also generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. The Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence startup, which burst into the mainstream last year thanks to the viral popularity of ChatGPT, introduced Sora in February.\n\nIt\u2019ll debut to U.S. users as well as to \u201cmost countries internationally\u201d later today, according to OpenAI\u2019s YouTube livestream, and the company has \u201cno timeline\u201d yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries.\n\nOpenAI said users don\u2019t need to pay extra for the tool, which will be included in existing ChatGPT accounts such as Plus and Pro. Employees on the livestream and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman demonstrated features like \u201cBlend\u201d (i.e., joining two scenes together at the user\u2019s direction), as well as the option to make an AI-generated video endlessly repeat.\n\nUntil now, Sora has mainly been available to a small group of safety testers, or \u201cred-teamers,\u201d who test the model for vulnerabilities in areas such as misinformation and bias.\n\nReddit users asked OpenAI executives in October about Sora\u2019s release date, questioning whether it was being delayed \u201cdue to the amount of compute/time required for inference or due to safety.\u201d In response, OpenAI\u2019s product chief Kevin Weil wrote, \u201cNeed to perfect the model, need to get safety/impersonation/other things right, and need to scale compute!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe obviously have a big target on our back as OpenAI,\u201d Rohan Sahai, OpenAI\u2019s Sora product lead, said on the livestream, adding that the company needs to prevent illegal use of the technology. \u201cBut we also want to balance that with creative expression.\u201d\n\nOpenAI closed its latest funding round in October at a valuation of $157 billion, including the $6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and Big Tech companies. It also received a $4 billion revolving line of credit, bringing its total liquidity to more than $10 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a serious growth plan for OpenAI, as the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence startup battles Amazon-backed Anthropic, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon for the biggest slice of the generative AI market, which is predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\n\nEarlier this month, OpenAI hired its first chief marketing officer, indicating plans to spend more on marketing to grow its user base. And in October, OpenAI debuted a search feature within ChatGPT that positions it to better compete with search engines like Google, Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Perplexity and may attract more users who otherwise visited those sites to search the web.\n\nWith Sora, the ChatGPT maker is looking to compete with video-generation AI tools from companies such as Meta and Google, which announced Lumiere in January. Similar AI tools are available from other startups, such as Stability AI\u2019s Stable Video Diffusion. Amazon has also released Create with Alexa, a model that specializes in generating prompt-based short-form animated children\u2019s content.\n\nVideo could be the next frontier for generative AI now that chatbots and image generators have made their way into the consumer and business world. While the creative opportunities will excite some AI enthusiasts, the new technologies present serious misinformation concerns as major political elections occur across the globe. The number of AI-generated deepfakes created has increased 900% year over year, according to data from Clarity, a machine learning firm.\n\nOpenAI has made multimodality \u2014 the combining of text, image and video generation \u2014 a prominent goal in its effort to offer a broader suite of AI models.\n\nNews of Sora\u2019s release follows protestors\u2019 decision to leak what appeared to be a copy of Sora over concerns about the ChatGPT maker\u2019s treatment of artists.\n\nSome members of OpenAI\u2019s early access program for Sora, which it said included about 300 artists, published an open letter in late November critiquing OpenAI for not being sufficiently open or supporting the arts beyond marketing.\n\n\u201cDear corporate AI overlords,\u201d the protestors\u2019 open letter stated, \u201cWe received access to Sora with the promise to be early testers, red teamers and creative partners. However, we believe instead we are being lured into \u2018art washing\u2019 to tell the world that Sora is a useful tool for artists.\u201d\n\nThe letter added that hundreds of artists provided unpaid labor for OpenAI through bug testing and feedback on Sora, and that \u201cwhile hundreds contribute for free, a select few will be chosen through a competition to have their Sora-created films screened \u2014 offering minimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not against the use of AI technology as a tool for the arts (if we were, we probably wouldn\u2019t have been invited to this program),\u201d the open letter stated. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t agree with is how this artist program has been rolled out and how the tool is shaping up ahead of a possible public release. We are sharing this to the world in the hopes that OpenAI becomes more open, more artist friendly and supports the arts beyond PR stunts.\u201d\n\nIn late November, an OpenAI spokesperson responded to the protestors\u2019 actions in a statement to CNBC.\n\n\u201cHundreds of artists in our alpha have shaped Sora\u2019s development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards,\u201d the OpenAI spokesperson said at the time. \u201cParticipation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool. We\u2019ve been excited to offer these artists free access and will continue supporting them through grants, events, and other programs.\u201d"

A bunch of new things, big and small. 12 Days of OpenAI starts tomorrow.\"\n\nCEO Sam Altman also alluded to the campaign Wednesday at The New York Times' DealBook Summit. \"We have a bunch of new, great stuff. We're doing this kind of fun thing for the holidays. We're doing 12 days of OpenAI,\" he said. \"We'll either launch something or do a demo every day for the next 12 weekdays.\"\n\nHere's everything OpenAI has released so far for \"Shipmas.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Shipmas' Day 1\n\nOpenAI started the promotion with a bang by releasing the full version of its latest reasoning model, o1.\n\n\n\nOpenAI previewed o1 in September, describing it as a series of artificial-intelligence models \"designed to spend more time thinking before they respond.\" Until now, only a limited version of these models was available to ChatGPT Plus and Team users.\n\n\n\nNow these users have access to the full capabilities of o1 models, which Altman said are faster, smarter, and easier to use than the preview. They're also multimodal, which means they can process images and texts jointly.\n\nMax Schwarzer, a researcher at OpenAI, said the full version of o1 was updated based on user feedback from the preview version and said it's now more intelligent and accurate.\n\n\"We ran a pretty detailed suite of human evaluations for this model, and what we found was that it made major mistakes about 34% less often than o1 preview while thinking fully about 50% faster,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with o1, OpenAI unveiled a new tier of ChatGPT called ChatGPT Pro. It's priced at $200 a month and includes unlimited access to the latest version of o1.\n\n'Shipmas' Day 2\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI previewed an advancement that allows users to fine-tune o1 on their own datasets. Users can now leverage OpenAI's reinforcement-learning algorithms \u2014 which mimic the human trial-and-error learning process \u2014 to customize their own models.\n\n\n\nThe technology will be available to the public next year, allowing anyone from machine-learning engineers to genetic researchers to create domain-specific AI models. OpenAI has already partnered with the Reuters news agency to develop a legal assistant based on o1-mini. It has also partnered with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to develop computational methods for assessing rare genetic diseases.\n\nRelated stories\n\n'Shipmas' Day 3\n\nThe Explore page of OpenAI's Sora AI tool, which generates AI videos from text prompts. screenshot/OpenAI\n\nOpenAI announced on December 9 that its AI video generator Sora was launching to the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSora can generate up to 20-second videos from written instructions. The tool can also complete a scene and extend existing videos by filling in missing frames.\n\n\"We want our AIs to be able to understand video and generate video and I think it really will deeply change the way that we use computers,\" the CEO added.\n\nRohan Sahai, Sora's product lead, said a product team of about five or six engineers built the product in months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company showed off the new product and its various features, including the Explore page, which is a feed of videos shared by the community. It also showed various style presets available like pastel symmetry, film noir, and balloon world.\n\nOpenAI showed off Sora's features, including Storyboard for further customizing AI videos. screenshot/OpenAI\n\nThe team also gave a demo of Sora's Storyboard feature, which lets users organize and edit sequences on a timeline.\n\nSora is rolling out to the public in the US and many countries around the world. However, Altman said it will be \"a while\" before the tool rolls out in the UK and most of Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChatGPT Plus subscribers who pay $20 monthly can get up to 50 generations per month of AI videos that are 5 seconds long with a resolution of 720p. ChatGPT Pro users who pay $200 a month get unlimited generations in the slow queue mode and 500 faster generations, Altman said in the demo. Pro users can generate up to 20-second long videos that are 1080p resolution, without watermarks."

Styling as well as drying your hair, the device is the ideal way to get salon-perfect hair from home. Right now, there\u2019s 15% off the Shark FlexFusion range when you buy direct from Sharkclean.com. All you have to do is use the code FUSION15 any time between now and December 31. That means you could get a Shark FlexFusion from just $280 depending on the model you choose. Sounds good, right? Let\u2019s take a look at the range.\n\nWhy you should buy a Shark FlexFusion\n\nParticularly for anyone with thick hair, buying one of the best hair dryers is a huge game changer. However, it\u2019s an even bigger deal if you combine drying with styling components. Many people love the Dyson Corrale for this role but it isn\u2019t perfect and it\u2019s much more expensive than the Shark FlexFusion. Going with Shark means you can budget for an extra gift or simply enjoy a considerable saving.\n\nOne of the best options is the with Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush. Down to $280 from $330 when you apply the code FUSION15, you get the perfect all-in-one tool for drying, curling, volumizing, smoothing, or straightening. There\u2019s no risk of heat damage from styling and you can even dry and style wet hair. It also has a scalp shield for protecting your scalp, and it\u2019s developed by dermatologists so you\u2019re all good here.\n\nWhen buying, you can choose two accessories such as a FrizzFighter, Oval Burhs, or auto-wrapper. It\u2019s perfect for personalizing your gift choice for your loved one. If you want to spend more, you can do so by investing in more accessories, or by adding on an air straightener. It\u2019s great to have such flexibility here as it feels much more like picking an individual gift for someone rather than just choosing an out-of-the-box solution.\n\nThe Shark FlexFusion range is now available with 15% off when you use the code FUSION15 at Sharkclean.com. The code works until December 31 but we think it\u2019d be great to buy now to gift to someone ahead of the holidays. Check out which bundle works best for you by tapping the link below and don\u2019t forget to apply the code!"

For context, always refer to the full article.\n\nCybercriminals are also employing real-world physical attacks in addition to digital threats, US cybersecurity firm Fortinet finds\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2013 US cybersecurity firm Fortinet on Tuesday, December 10, presented to the media their annual threat predictions report for 2025.\n\nAs expected, artificial intelligence continues to generate buzz. In the cybersecurity industry, Fortinet describes an ongoing arms race between cybersecurity professionals and firms such as them, and threat actors.\n\nThreat actors have made use of artificial intelligence in the past year in order to make attacks more efficient, more prevalent, and more targeted. Through AI, threat actors or hackers can more easily, for example, craft more sophisticated phishing messages that may have a higher chance of reeling in a victim.\n\nAI has also been deployed by these hackers to much more easily modify code in order to evade security updates.\n\nThe technology has also lowered the barrier for entry for would-be hackers, much in the same way that people can now code programs with the help of large language models (LLMs). These are some of the threats being presented by AI, and Fortinet expects that such usage will only expand in the coming year.\n\nFor their part and the part of other cybersecurity vendors, they leverage AI for detecting danger patterns across whole swaths of network that manual monitoring just wouldn\u2019t be able to accomplish. Fortifying their software solutions is also helped along with AI tools.\n\nIt has always been an arms race between attackers and cybersecurity vendors. The difference here is that AI scales up the speed, efficiency, and frequency of attacks, necessitating vendors to make use of similar technologies to maintain defenses.\n\nAside from AI, here are the key trends to expect:\n\nMore attack chain expertise emerges. In recent years, attackers have provided \u201cjack of all trades\u201d cyber-attacks-as-a-service (CaaS) \u201coffering buyers everything needed to execute an attack, from phishing kits to payload.\u201d But Fortinet sees these providers increasingly embracing specialization \u201cwith many groups focusing on providing offerings that home in on just one segment of the attack chain.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn recent years, attackers have provided \u201cjack of all trades\u201d cyber-attacks-as-a-service (CaaS) \u201coffering buyers everything needed to execute an attack, from phishing kits to payload.\u201d But Fortinet sees these providers increasingly embracing specialization \u201cwith many groups focusing on providing offerings that home in on just one segment of the attack chain.\u201d Cloud-specific attacks to rise.

That\u2019s $65 off the retail price. You\u2019ll need to take a few steps to unlock this bundled price, though.\n\nFirst, add to cart the MX Keys S combo on Logitech\u2019s store. That\u2019s listed for $199.99 price, which is already $10 less versus the MX Keys S and MX Master 3S mouse separately, plus a sweet wrist rest included. Once added to your cart, you\u2019ll notice that you also get a free POP Rubik\u2019s cube. (Weird, but okay. Can\u2019t complain if it\u2019s free.) And with the additional $35 discount automatically applied in the cart, it brings the price down to $164.99.\n\nLogitech\n\nNow, click the \u201cEnter Promo Code\u201d text just above the checkout button.

In 2024 alone, we\u2019ve seen the likes of Healx raise $47 million to tackle rare diseases; Sam Altman-backed Formation Bio raise $372 million; and Xaira emerge from stealth with a whopping $1 billion in funding.\n\nGoogle DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Director John Jumper, meanwhile, shared one-half of the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on Alphafold, an AI system that accurately predicts protein structures \u2014 vital for drug discovery.\n\nAqemia, for its part, says it\u2019s using physics and statistical mechanics algorithms to train a generative AI system, which then helps design potential drug candidates for \u201ccritical diseases.\u201d The initial focus is on oncology (cancer) and immuno-oncology (using the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer).\n\nThe company says this approach to training AI negates the need for experimental data, which is costly and time-consuming, and instead uses algorithms to essentially generate synthetic data to predict the properties of potential drug molecules and how they might interact with the target.\n\nLondon\u2019s calling\n\nIt\u2019s clear that AI-enabled drug discovery is a hot space right now, and Aqemia itself has already been making headway in industry. Last December, the startup signed a multi-year agreement with French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi, a deal that could be worth up to $140 million depending on the outcome of certain R&D milestones.\n\nWith a fresh $38 million in the bank, the company is now gearing up to bolster its recruitment efforts. That includes a new office in London that\u2019s set to open in early 2025 \u2014 a move designed to give Aqemia \u201caccess to the UK\u2019s rich talent pool,\u201d according to a press release. Having a global VC firm like Cathay Innovation on board could also open the door to new markets.\n\n\u201cLess than a year after our last round, this successful fundraising and the opening of our new London office mark significant strides toward our ambition to accelerate the discovery of new medicines on a global scale,\u201d Levesque said in a statement. \u201cPartnering with Cathay Innovation brings international expertise, particularly in the U.S. and Asia, reinforcing our vision and mission.\u201d\n\nAside from lead backer Cathay Innovation, Aqemia\u2019s latest round saw participation from existing investors Wendel, Bpifrance Large Venture, Eurazeo, and Elaia."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nFinding a reasonable hypothesis can pose a challenge when there are thousands of possibilities. This is why Dr. Joseph Sang-II Kwon is trying to make hypotheses in a generalizable and systematic manner.\n\nKwon, an associate professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, published his work on blending traditional physics-based scientific models with experimental data to accurately predict hypotheses in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering.\n\nKwon's research extends beyond the realm of traditional chemical engineering. By connecting physical laws with machine learning, his work could impact renewable energy, smart manufacturing, and health care, outlined in his recent paper, \"Adding big data into the equation.\"\n\nDeriving hypotheses for experimental observations typically involves a trial-and-error process. Kwon has developed a systematic framework that integrates specialized knowledge with experimental data to create a more efficient process.\n\n\"The most impactful aspect of this research is its ability to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexity, creating a versatile framework to solve intricate problems,\" Kwon said. \"This versatility means that the potential benefits could reach a wide range of industries and significantly impact daily life.\"\n\nThis research could lead to new drug discovery by incorporating experimental data into these models, Kwon said. This hybrid modeling approach integrates biological knowledge with data to accelerate drug predictions.\n\n\"Developing new drugs is expensive and time-consuming,\" Kwon said. \"But with more advanced models, we can accelerate the discovery and manufacturing processes. Leveraging simulations and machine learning reduces the need for costly lab experiments, saving time and speeding up the discovery of new treatments.\"\n\nHis approach combines physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven components that can adapt and correct predictions based on real-world experimental data.\n\nKwon plans to use these models as a backbone to simulate complex systems and capture underlying physical phenomena that traditional physics-based models cannot capture alone.\n\n\"This methodology allows us to continuously estimate process parameters alongside the hyperparameters of the data-driven component,\" Kwon said. \"By doing so, we ensure that the models are applicable to a wider range of conditions, making them more versatile and better suited to handle new and varied scenarios.\"\n\n\"Purely data-driven models fall short when it comes to capturing the intricacies of these systems,\" Kwon said. \"By blending the two approaches, we can improve the efficiency and reliability of industrial processes that are critical to producing everyday essentials such as energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\"\n\nMore information: Joseph Sang-Il Kwon, Adding big data into the equation, Nature Chemical Engineering (2024).

            "article_content": "Physicists have been puzzling over conflicting observational results pertaining to the accelerating expansion rate of our Universe\u2014a major discovery recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.\n\nHow many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.\n\nJust last year, researchers made a third independent measure of the Universe's expansion by tracking the behavior of a gravitationally lensed supernova, where the distortion in space-time caused by a massive object acts as a lens to magnify an object in the background. The best fits of those models all ended up slightly below the value of the Hubble Constant derived from the CMB, with the difference being within the statistical error. Values closer to those derived from measurements of other supernovae were a considerably worse fit for the data. The method was new, with considerable uncertainties, but it did provide an independent means of getting at the Hubble Constant."

Become one of them.\n\nThe Source to Sea journey was the brainchild of Joe Dadey, the executive director of Hamlets to Huts in Saranac Lake, and Greg Morrissey, the founder of Mountain Goat Movement, a guide service in New Jersey.\n\nIn all, some 20 people made the 375-mile trek over two weeks in the summer of 2023. Others in the expedition included adult leaders, guides and a four-person film crew.\n\nAn image provided by Joe Dadey from the student trip from Marcy to NYC along the Hudson River.\n\nThe students traveled under their own steam, hiking over Mount Marcy; canoeing, rafting and kayaking much of the Hudson; and biking on the Empire State Trail.\n\nExposing the students to the outdoors and testing their mettle were not the only goals of the expedition. Along the way they took water samples that labs would test for pollution.\n\nThe Adirondack Explorer thanks its advertising partners. Become one of them.\n\nTim Keyes, a data analyst, acted as the group\u2019s science coordinator. He described the water sampling as citizen science, not the sort of rigorous research that appears in peer-reviewed journals. Nevertheless, the students did find something significant: microplastics in Lake Tear of the Clouds, the little pond on the slopes of Mount Marcy. Lake Tear is the highest source of the Hudson.\n\nMicroplastics are minuscule fragments of plastic that exist seemingly everywhere on the planet (and in our bodies). In the Adirondacks, they had been found in Lake Champlain and the Saranac and St. Regis rivers. The Source to Sea expedition dashed the hope that Lake Tear\u2019s remoteness protected it from this insidious and invisible form of pollution.\n\n\u201cThat finding was surprising, but maybe not so much now as we learn more about the presence of microplastics in the environment,\u201d Dadey said.\n\nIt seems safe to assume that microplastics can found anywhere in the Adirondacks. All of the water samples taken by the students along their journey contained microplastics.\n\nThe Adirondack Explorer thanks its advertising partners. Become one of them.\n\nMicroplastics are shed into the environment from innumerable sources, including car tires as you drive to the trailhead and the fleece jacket you wear on a hike. The labs did not ascertain the type of microplastics found in Lake Tear or the Hudson, though such testing is possible. Dadey said he may order such tests as part of a future expedition.\n\nMORE TO EXPLORE: Read a first-hand account of the trip\n\nTwo of the students lived in the Adirondacks: Sage Whidden of Saranac Lake and Cole Sears of North Creek. Both are now freshmen in college. Four of the students came from the New York City region. Two were from California.\n\nAll of the students were boys. Dadey explained that the leaders wanted to avoid \u201cguy/girl dynamics.\u201d He is thinking about putting together a trip for girls in the future.\n\nThe Adirondack Explorer thanks its advertising partners. Become one of them.\n\nAn image provided by Joe Dadey from the student trip along the Hudson River.\n\nThe students enjoyed spectacular scenery, including the High Peaks, the Hudson Gorge and the Manhattan skyline, but they had to earn those views. Indeed, they must have wondered what they got themselves into on the very first day of the trip. Starting at Adirondak Loj early in the morning, they hiked over Mount Marcy, the state\u2019s highest peak, and descended to Lake Tear. Given the filming and water sampling, progress was slow. After an 18-mile hike, the students arrived at their campsite at 3 a.m. On Day 2, despite a shortage of sleep, they canoed more than 11 miles on the Hudson and then biked another five miles to Newcomb.\n\nThere were other hard days, such as when strong headwinds forced them to pull off the river near Stillwater in Saratoga County. The next day they biked 70 miles in 90-degree heat. Over the next three days they biked all the way to New Jersey, crossing the Hudson on the George Washington Bridge in Manhattan. On the final day they paddled kayaks to Jersey City, where they were reunited with family and friends.\n\n\u201cIt was really, really tough, but it was a lot of fun,\u201d Dadey said of the expedition. He praised Barnhardt and his crew for capturing the essence of the experience in the documentary. \u201cIt highlights the grit and perseverance of these young men.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Follow us on Image Source : NASA Dust for planet formation\n\nA team of Indian astronomers has made an exciting discovery that could change our understanding of how planets are formed. Led by Liton Majumdar from the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) in Odisha, the team studied a fascinating triple-star system known as GG Tau A, which is located 489 light-years away from Earth.\n\nWhat Makes GG Tau A Special?\n\nUnlike our Sun, which is a single star, GG Tau A has three stars that move around each other. This unusual arrangement is rare in the universe and studying it helps scientists learn more about how planets can form in complex star systems. GG Tau A is also quite young, only about 1 to 5 million years old, making it an excellent example for examining the early stages of planet formation. Surrounding the stars is a ring of gas and dust, which is where planets start to form.\n\nIn most star systems, planets form around just one star. However, in systems like GG Tau A with multiple stars, the gravitational forces between the stars can influence the behavior of the gas and dust. This is why researching GG Tau A is vital; it offers insight into how planets may form in these more complicated environments.\n\nThe Role of Cold and Icy Conditions\n\nTo learn more about planet formation in this system, the team used advanced radio telescopes in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert. They focused on the coldest areas of the dust and gas ring, where temperatures can drop to around -261 degrees Fahrenheit (around the freezing point of carbon monoxide). In these chilly regions, molecules freeze into tiny particles of dust. These frozen molecules are essential because they help create the building blocks for forming planets.\n\nIn these extremely cold areas, the tiny dust particles begin to stick together, gradually forming larger clumps. Over time, these clumps can grow into planets as they gather more gas and dust. Understanding this process is crucial for scientists looking to understand how planets might form in distant, cold star systems.\n\nWhy Cold Temperatures Matter\n\nThe very low temperatures in these regions are vital for planet formation. At such cold temperatures, gas and dust particles can easily clump together. If it were warmer, it would be much harder for these particles to stick together, which would make planet formation more difficult. This discovery highlights just how important cold conditions are for the development of new planets.\n\nWhat Happens in Multi-Star Systems?\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of GG Tau A is its status as a multi-star system. While scientists know quite a bit about how planets form around a single star, there\u2019s still a lot to learn about how they form when there\u2019s more than one star involved. The interaction between the three stars in GG Tau A can change the way the surrounding dust and gas behave, making it challenging to predict how planets might form.\n\nThe influences among the stars can cause the gas and dust to act differently than in a system with only one star. This makes GG Tau A a perfect subject for studying how planets can develop in complex, multi-star environments.\n\nALSO READ: NASA's lunar mission timeline shifts: Artemis 2 delayed to 2026, Artemis 3 to mid-2027"

Police also told the NYT that Mangione is now considered a \"strong person of interest\" in light of the new evidence.\n\nMangione, a prep school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate, was captured by police in Altoona, Pennsylvania earlier on Monday. His arrest followed a days-long manhunt for Thompson's suspected assassin that included the deployment of drones, scuba divers, and K-9 units.\n\nAs digital sleuths discovered soon after Mangione's name was released, the young man's social media accounts contain a wealth of information about his worldview, which seems to have morphed from disgruntled academic to angry manarchist over the course of this year \u2014 before dropping off completely months before the killing.\n\nThis entire debacle has been incredibly dramatic \u2014 and as we learn more about law enforcement's primary suspect, we're likely in for a few more shocks.\n\nMore on the murder of Brian Thompson: Bill Burr: Murdered Insurance CEO Was a \"Gangster\""

            "article_content": "OpenAI has unveiled its text-to-video AI model, Sora Turbo, to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users, marking a significant step in its expansion into multimodal AI technologies. This development places OpenAI in direct competition with tools from tech giants like Meta, Google, and Stability AI.\n\nFirst introduced in February as part of a limited research preview, Sora Turbo is now accessible to a wider audience. Users can create 20-second videos in resolutions up to 1080p, with options for widescreen, vertical, or square formats\u2014all at no additional cost for ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers.\n\nWhile currently unavailable in the EU, UK, and Switzerland, Sora Turbo is rolling out to regions where ChatGPT is already active.\n\nThe text-to-video market is heating up, with Meta\u2019s Make-A-Video, Google\u2019s Imagen Video, and Stability AI\u2019s Stable Video Diffusion already competing for dominance. OpenAI\u2019s entry signals its intent to lead this emerging field.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on tailored pricing for different types of users, which we plan to make available early next year,\u201d the company stated in a blog post, hinting at further scalability.\n\nUsers can generate videos in up to 1080p resolution, with durations of up to 20 seconds. The model supports various aspect ratios, including widescreen, vertical, and square. Sora also allows users to bring their own assets to remix, extend, and blend content, or to create entirely new videos from text prompts.\n\nNew interfaces have been introduced to enhance user interaction. A storyboard tool enables precise input specification for each frame, while Featured and Recent feeds showcase a constantly updated stream of creations from the Sora community.\n\nSora is included with ChatGPT Plus accounts at no extra charge, offering up to 50 videos per month at 480p resolution or fewer videos at 720p. For power users, the Pro plan provides 10 times more usage, access to higher resolutions, and longer video durations.\n\nOpenAI emphasised its commitment to responsible AI usage, implementing strict safeguards to prevent abuse. Sora will block the creation and upload of harmful content, including child sexual abuse materials and sexual deepfakes. \u201cUploads of people will be limited at launch, but we intend to roll the feature out to more users as we refine our deepfake mitigations,\u201d the company added."

            "article_content": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAdvancements in AI have revolutionized many industries, from healthcare and education to finance and entertainment, offering unparalleled efficiency, precision, and the ability to handle complex tasks at a scale previously unimaginable.\n\nOn the positive side, AI can streamline operations, improve decision-making, and even solve pressing global issues like climate change by analyzing large datasets. However, these advancements also come with significant risks. The rapid growth of AI technology has raised concerns about privacy, job displacement, and the potential misuse of AI systems in surveillance and defense.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Probably Missed and Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Push into Defense Raises Concerns Among Employees\n\nOpenAI is teaming up with Anduril Industries to enhance anti-drone systems using its AI technology, as per Bloomberg. This partnership aims to improve the detection and response to unmanned aerial threats. OpenAI is also expanding its role in the defense sector, including collaborations with the U.S. Air Force and hiring former Pentagon officials. The deal reflects the growing U.S.-China competition in military AI development, with Anduril seeing it as vital for addressing global air defense gaps. The partnership also signals increasing AI involvement in defense, following similar moves by other tech companies.\n\nHowever, OpenAI employees have raised concerns about the company\u2019s partnership with Anduril Industries, seeking more transparency from leadership. Internal messages viewed by The Washington Post revealed worries that the AI technology could be used beyond defensive applications against drone attacks, potentially targeting human-piloted aircraft or being deployed for other military purposes. Some employees expressed discomfort with collaborating with a weapons manufacturer, fearing damage to OpenAI\u2019s reputation. Others noted that even defensive uses of AI could contribute to its militarization, drawing parallels to the fictional Skynet system from The Terminator, which was originally designed for defense.\n\nApart from OpenAI, there are several other startups that are working in the military and defense sectors. One of them includes DEFCON AI, a company focused on next-generation modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A) for military logistics. The company focuses on creating efficient, reliable systems that help address disruptions in logistics and supply chains, ensuring timely delivery of personnel, equipment, and cargo during critical situations.\n\nIts approach combines AI-driven intelligent agents and advanced modeling to help leaders test and prepare for contested logistics scenarios. In August, DEFCON raised $44 million in seed funding. The round was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Fifth Growth Fund and Red Cell Partners. With its strong leadership team, including retired military officials, the company is set to address the growing need for intelligent military technology in the face of increasing global competition.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 235\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) integrates AI into its products, enhancing user experiences across apps like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, and also has its own language models. Its Reality Labs segment uses AI for advancements in augmented and virtual reality, supporting immersive connectivity and innovation.\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) unveiled Llama 3.3, its newest large language model on December 6. Llama 3.3 is a multilingual large language model with 70 billion parameters, designed for text-based input and output. It is optimized for multilingual dialogue and outperforms several other models in industry benchmarks. The model uses an auto-regressive architecture with Grouped-Query Attention for better scalability. It is fine-tuned using supervised learning and reinforcement learning with human feedback to enhance safety and usefulness. Llama 3.3 supports languages such as English, Spanish, German, and Hindi, among others.\n\nMeta\u2019s Gen AI VP, Ahmad Al-Dahle posted the following on X:\n\n\u201cIntroducing Llama 3.3 \u2013 a new 70B model that delivers the performance of our 405B model but is easier & more cost-efficient to run. By leveraging the latest advancements in post-training techniques including online preference optimization, this model improves core performance at a significantly lower cost, making it even more accessible to the entire open source community.\u201d\n\nOverall, META ranks 2nd on our list of trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

I have a B.Sc. in aeronautical engineering and over 6 years of experience as an engineering consultant in the aerospace sector. The latter statement is not relevant in any way whatsoever to my investment style, but I thought to add it for self-indulgent purposes. I have a contrarian investment style, highly risky, and often dealing with illiquid options. How illiquid? Well, you can land a Jumbo on the spread and still have clearance for take-off. From time to time, I buy shares, mostly to not be categorized as a degen by my fellow investor friends, therefore the 50%-50% allocation. My timeframe tends to be between 3-24 months.I like stocks that have experienced a recent sell-off due to non-recurrent events, particularly when insiders are buying shares at the new lower price. This is how I often screen through thousands of stocks, mainly in the US, although I may own shares in banana republics. I use fundamental analysis to check the health of companies that pass through my screening process, their leverage, and then compare their financial ratios with the sector, and industry median and average. I also do professional background checks of each insider who purchased shares after the recent sell-off. I use technical analysis to optimize the entry and exit points of my positions. I mainly use multicolor lines for support and resistance levels on weekly charts. From time to time I draw trend lines, taken for granted, in multicolor patterns. Note: I tried to keep my introduction as real, and authentic as possible. I dislike empty suits, high-level BS, deep-level BS, unnecessary jargon, and self-indulgent, third-person written introductions with an air of superiority.Thanks for reading my introduction!"

Amazing sales growth propelled it to the world's leading semiconductor company by market cap, and the company's success makes it among the top AI stocks to buy.\n\nThrough the week ending Dec. 6, Nvidia shares are trading up almost 190% in 2024. With such an incredible increase, it may seem like the opportunity to buy shares has passed -- but that's not the case. Here's why Nvidia remains a great stock to invest in for exposure to the AI market.\n\nNvidia's leadership in accelerated computing\n\nOne factor making Nvidia an attractive investment is its leadership in advanced semiconductor chips for AI. Some estimates place its market share in the space at 80%.\n\nThe company initiated this by pioneering accelerated computing back in 1999 with the introduction of its graphics processing unit (GPU). Accelerated computing uses GPUs to perform data-intensive tasks, such as those required by AI systems, leaving other computer processes to be handled by the CPU.\n\nAccelerated computing took off with the rise of artificial intelligence, especially in the cloud computing sector, since AI systems commonly reside in the cloud's data centers. Demand for Nvidia's GPUs exploded with it.\n\nAs a result, in its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 27, the company's data center sales reached a record $30.8 billion, a staggering 112% year-over-year increase. This drove overall Q3 revenue to hit a record $35.1 billion, up 94% over the previous year.\n\nNvidia's financial might\n\nNvidia's massive revenue growth leads into the other factor making it a top AI stock -- the company's financial performance. Record Q3 sales propelled net income to $19.3 billion, which represented 109% year-over-year growth.\n\nConsequently, its Q3 diluted earnings per share (EPS) reached $0.78, up 111% from the prior year. In fact, Nvidia's EPS has been on a rocket ship since AI demand erupted in 2023.\n\nNVDA EPS Diluted (Quarterly) Chart\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nIn addition, the company exited Q3 with a spectacular balance sheet. Total assets were $96 billion. This included cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $38.5 billion, while total liabilities were just $30 billion.\n\nNvidia's many other strengths\n\nCan Nvidia's incredible success last? Several factors are in its favor. The company is the market leader in GPUs, and its products are being adopted by businesses and governments around the world to build up their AI capabilities. For example, the company's GPUs are used in AI supercomputers for Denmark, Taiwan, and Japan.\n\nNvidia also offers a slew of AI solutions. Its new computing architecture called Blackwell is specifically designed for AI. Each Blackwell GPU contains over 200 billion transistors, making it the world's most powerful chip, according to Nvidia. The company's Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress noted customer demand for Blackwell is so strong, \"we are on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate of several billion dollars.\"\n\nAdding to its GPU strength, the company also provides software for AI, such as its Nvidia NIM, a set of tools to simplify the creation of generative AI products. Many companies have adopted NIM, including ServiceNow and Broadcom. This integration of hardware and software tie customers more deeply into Nvidia's AI ecosystem and is another of the company's key strengths.\n\nFinally, CEO Jensen Huang said he believes the AI era is ushering in a new Industrial Revolution, one where data centers transform into AI factories as technology steadily becomes dependent on AI. This means the cloud computing market, forecast to reach $2.3 trillion by 2032, would increasingly transition to an accelerated computing architecture and, hence, require GPUs. If he's right, as he was about accelerated computing, then tapping into this massive market provides Nvidia with a prosperous future as the leader in AI chips.\n\nBut what about Nvidia stock's incredible gains this year? Does this mean it's overvalued? Comparing the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), a widely used metric to assess stock valuation, against other semiconductor businesses helps to answer that question.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nThe P/E ratio tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings. As the chart shows, Nvidia's P/E multiple is the lowest by a substantial margin against other big names in the semiconductor industry, indicating its stock is still a good value.\n\nThe company's current outstanding financial performance, coupled with the success of products such as Blackwell and the long-term growth of the AI market, means Nvidia is well-positioned for years of prosperity ahead. Despite the stock price gains this year, Nvidia remains reasonably valued, making it a great investment to capitalize on the secular trend of artificial intelligence.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "article_content": "The economy in rural America starts and stops with the American farmer.\n\nAmid the deafening noise inside political echo chambers and ceaseless squabbling of Congress is one truth that we cannot ignore- we are a nation united in reliance on our farmers.\n\nWithout the American farmer, there is no adequate tax base for our school systems, local municipalities, or any services that rural Americans need to live and prosper in this country.\n\nEverybody eats, and we all need the food and fiber that our farmers produce to live. No one wants to be dependent on foreign sources of food, just like no one wants to be dependent on foreign sources of energy. Right now, our farmers need our help.\n\nHurricane Helene caused a devastating blow to Georgia's No. 1 industry, with over $6.4 billion in agricultural economic loss alone.\n\nIf we fail to provide agriculture-specific appropriations to help our farmers before the end of the year, we will see widespread, lasting economic loss across all of rural southeast America, especially in Georgia.\n\nAs I traveled across Georgia's 8th Congressional District in the immediate aftermath of Helene, I saw the devastation to our farms firsthand. From hundreds of demolished poultry houses and cotton fields in Coffee County to decimated pecan orchards in Berrien and Lowndes counties and vegetable rows and fruit bushes in ruins across Clinch County, it is clear that our farmers need immediate assistance.\n\nCongress cannot stop a hurricane, but we can fix the unnatural disasters that our farmers face to aid their recovery.\n\nHouse Agriculture Chairman Glenn \"GT\" Thompson, R-Pa., Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., visited Georgia's 8th District with me recently to survey the damage after Helene across south Georgia and north Florida. Our farmers need help, and I appreciate the chairman and others taking the time to meet with them firsthand so we can better work together for relief.\n\nUnfortunately, trouble for our nation's farmers began far before Hurricane Helene. Since the last farm bill was passed in 2018, our farmers and nation have experienced excessively challenging events that have changed the political landscape in which we need to navigate to properly support the best stewards of our land.\n\nRelated Articles Opinion: The dire state of the American farm economy\n\nWith rising input costs, including the increased cost of labor, diesel, fertilizer, chemicals, and seed, farming is more expensive than it has ever been in our country.\n\nGeorgia's farmers were also horribly impacted by Hurricane Michael in 2018, which caused more than $2.5 billion in losses to the state's agriculture industry. It took approximately 24 months for our farmers to get relief after Hurricane Michael, and I can assure you that the majority of producers and rural communities that Helene hit cannot survive another 24 months without something being done.\n\nAmerica's farmers are also suffering from the unnaturally disastrous policies of the Biden-Harris administration, which have contributed to record inflation and the rising cost of energy and food production.\n\nThere has to be a strong safety net to keep good farmers farming through bad years like this one. If you are an American who eats, you should deeply care about the passage of a comprehensive farm bill that prioritizes production agriculture.\n\nEarlier this year, the House Agriculture Committee passed the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 (the farm bill). This legislation includes critical updates to reference prices and several of my priorities to ensure a strong farm safety net by expanding crop insurance options to specialty crops, all of which would greatly assist producers in times of natural disaster.\n\nHowever, this bill is stalled in Congress, and the Senate Democrats just released a half-baked last-minute \"farm bill\" just to look like they did something, further fueling the fear of the forgotten farmer as they struggle to feed us.\n\nWhen the American farmer stops farming, rural communities collapse because their core and main economic driver is gone. We need to give farmers the support they need to keep farming with the confidence to know they are not forgotten.\n\nIt is my hope that Congress passes both the Farm, Food, and National Security Act and an agriculture-specific disaster relief appropriations package before the end of the year so that our farmers can continue feeding our nation and supporting our rural communities.\n\nRepublican Rep. Austin Scott represents the 8th District of Georgia and is a member of the House Agriculture Committee."

            "article_content": "After Valve got a lot of PC gamers excited about gaming handhelds with its popular Steam Deck, the company appears to be working with third-party manufacturers on a comeback of Steam machines. The timing seems right now that SteamOS, Valve\u2019s Linux-based OS is a much better alternative to Windows when it comes to ease of use and game compatibility.\n\nYou may remember that back in 2015, Valve got Alienware and other manufacturers to release a couple of Steam machines for the living room. Valve even released its own Steam controller for these console-like devices, but these first Steam machines were probably ahead of their time. Indeed, that was before Valve started to invest in the Proton compatibility layer that made the most popular Windows games run seamlessly on SteamOS.\n\nWindows Intelligence In Your Inbox Sign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday \u2014 and get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field Guides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift! \"*\" indicates required fields Email * Comments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. \u0394\n\nOver the summer, Valve confirmed to The Verge that it was working to make SteamOS compatible with third-party gaming handhelds such as the Asus ROG Ally. The latter ships with Windows 11, which is great for gamers who want to use PC Game Pass or install other game launchers like Gog or the Epic Games Store. However, Windows 11 isn\u2019t optimized for running on devices with a 7-inch display like the ROG Ally. It also doesn\u2019t help that Asus and other manufacturers of Windows-based gaming handhelds are all building custom overlays that aren\u2019t easy to use and may sometimes clash with Windows features.\n\nOver the weekend, The Verge published a detailed roundup of all the things Valve appears to be working on right now to grow the SteamOS ecosystem. That includes a new Steam controller and what could be a new living room Steam box codenamed \u201cFremont.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the company also updated a Brand guidelines document that includes the new \u201cPowered by SteamOS\u201d logo you can see at the top of this article. The document says this logo will be used \u201cfor hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve.\u201d\n\nIf Valve\u2019s Steam Deck proved that there was an appetite for gaming handhelds providing seamless access to Steam games, Valve could significantly grow the SteamOS ecosystem with the help of third-party manufacturers. Unlike Windows, SteamOS is free, and it\u2019s optimized for gaming handhelds and the living room experience. Moreover, gamers don\u2019t need to pay a subscription like Xbox Game Pass Core or PlayStation Plus to play the Steam version of multiplayer games.\n\nAs of today, Valve is making SteamOS free to install for anyone, though the installation process is quite technical and the OS only supports a certain set of hardware. However, this new \u201cPowered by SteamOS logo\u201d suggests that may soon see third-party devices shipping with SteamOS out of the box. Whether that includes both gaming handhelds and console-like devices for the living room remains to be seen, however."

            "article_content": "If you need Windows 11 for your PC, you have two options: Windows 11 Home and Windows 11 Professional.\n\nThe Pro version is (obviously) the more expensive of the two because it offers a variety of extra features. The most compelling extra is full-featured BitLocker drive encryption for securing your data, as well as an intriguing Sandbox feature for testing software, plus some other stuff.\n\nBut what if you\u2019re just a regular home user? Are these additional features worth paying a bit more? Here\u2019s what you need to consider.\n\nWindows 11 Pro and BitLocker encryption\n\nBitLocker drive encryption is the main reason to get Windows 11 Professional. BitLocker is a full-disk encryption feature that protects your files from unauthorized access. If your PC is ever stolen or misplaced, nobody will be able to access your protected files without signing in as you. It\u2019s an essential modern security feature.\n\nGet Windows 11 Pro for cheap right now Windows 11 Pro Price When Reviewed: 199.99 Best Prices Today:\n\nBoth Windows 11 Home and Windows 11 Professional include some disk encryption features, but Microsoft\u2019s BitLocker encryption is much more powerful, flexible, and configurable on Windows 11 Pro.\n\nOn a PC running Windows 11 Home, you only get \u201cDevice Encryption.\u201d When you sign into your Windows PC with a Microsoft account, Windows 11 Home automatically enables BitLocker encryption and saves your recovery key to your Microsoft account.\n\nCurious whether Device Encryption is enabled on your PC? Head to Settings > Privacy & Security > Device encryption. If you don\u2019t see the option, your PC doesn\u2019t support it. New Windows 11 PCs do, but some older PCs that were upgraded from Windows 10 may not.\n\nChris Hoffman / IDG\n\nDevice Encryption is an adequate solution for many, but it\u2019s limited. For example, you must sign in with a Microsoft account, and you must store your recovery key in your Microsoft account online, and you can\u2019t use it to encrypt external drives. That last one might be a big deal.\n\nIf you want the full-featured BitLocker experience, you\u2019ll need Windows 11 Professional. You get a lot more options for configuring BitLocker the way you want it, plus you get BitLocker To Go for encrypting files on portable USB drives, SD cards, and other external storage devices.\n\nOther restrictions in Windows 11 Home\n\nApart from BitLocker, you aren\u2019t missing out on that much else in Windows 11 Home. After all, Microsoft wants to sell those expensive Pro licenses to businesses, so it makes sense that most of the restrictions involve business-oriented features.\n\nFor example, a PC running Windows 11 Home can\u2019t join a domain or an Azure Active Directory setup. It also doesn\u2019t have access to the Private Catalog feature in the Microsoft Store, which allows businesses to deploy their own apps to their PCs. These are things you\u2019d never need to do on a home PC \u2014 they\u2019re for computers being managed by a workplace.\n\nChris Hoffman / IDG\n\nSimilarly, you can\u2019t set up a Windows 11 Home PC as a Remote Desktop server. In other words, you can\u2019t Remote Desktop into a Windows 11 Home PC, but you can Remote Desktop from a Windows 11 Home PC into a Windows 11 Pro PC. (If you really need to remote into your home PC, you can always turn to third-party remote desktop tools.)\n\nWindows 11 Home also doesn\u2019t have access to Microsoft\u2019s Hyper-V software for creating virtual machines. This, too, can be done using other virtual machine apps like the now-free VMWare or VirtualBox.\n\nThe Home version of Windows also doesn\u2019t have access to the Local Group Policy Editor, which is mainly used by businesses to centrally configure their PCs. That said, the Local Group Policy Editor is a convenient way to adjust some system settings that would otherwise require modifying the registry instead. But is it so useful that it\u2019s worth shelling out extra for a Pro license? Not really.\n\nExclusive Sandbox in Windows 11 Pro\n\nApart from a more fully featured and configurable BitLocker encryption experience, and apart from the business-oriented features that aren\u2019t in Windows 11 Home, Windows 11 Pro also offers another big feature called the Sandbox, which is really useful but admittedly niche.\n\nThe Windows Sandbox uses Hyper-V software under the hood to give you a fresh, isolated Windows system that runs in a separate \u201csandbox\u201d window every time you launch it. This separation gives you a way to test potentially sketchy software or malware to see what happens, all without modifying or affecting your actual operating system.\n\nAnd when Sandbox is closed, it destroys all the data within it \u2014 even if the sandboxed environment is infected with malware, it\u2019s contained and wiped out as soon as it\u2019s closed. Simply restart Sandbox and you once again get a fresh, untainted Windows system.\n\nIt\u2019s one of our favorite Windows features for security, especially when paired with a reputable VPN. It\u2019s honestly so good that if you can find a use for it in your day-to-day, the Sandbox feature alone can make the upgrade to Windows 11 Pro worth it.\n\nWindows 11 Home vs. Pro: Pricing\n\nIf you\u2019re buying a Windows 11 license for a PC you\u2019re building, Microsoft sells Windows 11 Home for $139 and Windows 11 Pro for $199. However, there are ways to find cheaper Windows 11 licenses.\n\nYou can upgrade any Windows 11 Home PC to Windows 11 Pro whenever you want for just $99. Just head to Settings > System > Activation, expand the \u201cUpgrade your edition of Windows\u201d section, then click the Open Store button to get started.\n\nChris Hoffman / IDG\n\nIf you\u2019re buying a Windows 11 laptop or desktop PC that comes with Windows 11 preinstalled, most will include a Windows 11 Home license. But some PCs do come with a Windows 11 Professional license, too. (Usually higher-end PCs marketed for business use.) And some PC manufacturers let you pay a few extra bucks for Windows 11 Pro while customizing your new PC during the shopping process.\n\nWindows 11 Pro is worth it if\u2026\n\nUltimately, Windows 11 Pro is worth it for two big reasons: the full-featured BitLocker experience and Windows Sandbox.\n\nIf you don\u2019t plan on signing into your PC with a Microsoft account, I recommend opting for Windows 11 Pro so you can securely encrypt your PC\u2019s storage drives. And if you\u2019re intrigued by Sandbox, that\u2019s another good reason to plunk down cash for Windows 11 Pro. Even at retail prices, it\u2019s only an extra $60 over Home.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re running a business, then Windows 11 Pro also makes sense for its business-oriented features, like domains and Azure Active Directory to centrally manage PCs, or the Local Group Policy Editor. Microsoft has gone out of its way to ensure that these features require the more expensive Windows 11 Professional license.\n\nOtherwise, most home PC users shouldn\u2019t need anything more than Windows 11 Home, especially if you sign into Windows with a Microsoft account. That\u2019ll get you the Device Encryption feature, which is almost as good as full BitLocker for average Windows users."

            "article_content": "It's a fish story with a big, unexpected plot twist.\n\nA native Great Lakes whitefish thought extinct for nearly 40 years has been rediscovered by scientists \u2014 in the wrong Great Lake.\n\nThe Shortnose Cisco was once abundant on the Great Lakes, but overfishing and invasive species such as sea lamprey, zebra and quagga mussels, alewives and round gobies dwindled the fish's numbers and disrupted its habitat. A 2016 Great Lakes Fishery Commission report on ciscoes of the Great Lakes described the Shortnose's historic waters as Great Lakes Michigan, Huron and Ontario.\n\n\"Despite more recent sampling using appropriate gear at suitable locations and depths, (the Shortnose Cisco) was last recorded in Lake Ontario in 1964, Lake Michigan in 1982, and Lake Huron in 1985 and is currently believed to be extinct,\" the report stated.\n\n'Nobody was expecting us to find this'\n\nNot so fast. In 2022, Shortnose Cisco were discovered in scientists' fish surveys on Lake Superior \u2014 a lake in which scientists did not believe the fish lived.\n\nUSGS scientists have declined to discuss the Shortnose Cisco find with the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, citing an agency policy of waiting until peer-reviewed research is published on the topic. But they've discussed it among themselves and their fellow fishery scientists, including in emails obtained by the Free Press.\n\nThe Shortnose Cisco \"had not been seen\" before by any modern scientists on Lake Superior, Owen Gorman, a research fisheries biologist with U.S. Geological Survey's Great Lakes Science Center in Ann Arbor, said during a panel presentation earlier this year before the Lake Superior Technical Committee, a scientific body helping inform the Great Lakes Fishery Commission.\n\n\"It was assumed to be extinct for nearly 40 years on the Great Lakes, so nobody was expecting us to find this,\" he said. \"But apparently, there it is.\"\n\nThe Shortnose Cisco belongs to a class of fish known as coregonines, including as many as 11 species of cisco and whitefish native to the Great Lakes. According to the Fishery Commission, coregonines were abundant in each lake a century ago, occupying diverse habitats \u2014 rivers, bays and the deepest parts of the lakes. Some species were key prey for lake trout and burbot, supporting a Great Lakes fishery now valued at $7 billion annually.\n\nAmong the coregonines, different species of ciscoes declined dramatically between the 1920s and 1970s due to overfishing, invasive species and habitat loss. At least two species were considered extinct \u2014 including the just-rediscovered Shortnose \u2014 and several other species no longer appear in several lakes. The whitefish species have been more resilient, but have been undergoing their own declines in the past 20 years, fishery commission officials said.\n\nUSGS, working with state and provincial fisheries managers, has undertaken efforts to better understand the various coregonine species and how they live. Using trawler nets along the lake bottom and gill nets farther up the water column, researchers on Lake Superior have been catching coregonines over the past several years, studying both their morphology \u2014 the shapes, measurements and characteristics of their bodies \u2014 and utilizing advancements in genetics research to better understand just what cisco species are in the lake.\n\nIt was during those missions, in July 2022, that three young Shortnose Cisco were identified among the fish collected in trawl nets near the Keweenaw Peninsula.\n\nMore:Climate change transforming where fish in the Great Lakes region live\n\nMore:Eating locally caught freshwater fish can put PFAS in human blood, study says\n\nIn the emails obtained by the Free Press through a U.S. Freedom of Information Act request, scientists expressed surprise at the discovery.\n\n\"The fabled Lake Superior Shortnose collected July 12-13, 2022,\" USGS fishery biologist Mark Vinson emailed to USGS colleagues on Feb. 14, 2023, attaching a photo of three small, silvery fish in labeled plastic bags.\n\n\"Wow! Age-0 Shortnose cisco caught!!!!\" replied USGS fishery biologist David \"Bo\" Bunnell.\n\nFurther study on Lake Superior found even more Shortnose Cisco, this time adults.\n\nAn early fishery researcher is vindicated\n\nBetween 2006 and 2021, USGS collected 602 adult fish, from which they could extract genetic material, from around Lake Superior. Morphological characteristics of the fish were measured \u2014 the size of their eyes; aspects of their gillrakers, cartilaginous appendages fish use to capture tiny invertebrates; fin lengths, jaw shapes, and more. Simultaneously but separately, researchers also tested the genetics of the caught fish. Their goal: to see if they could find any clusters of particular species in the Lake Superior coregonines, or just an undifferentiated mix of unidentifiable fish.\n\nBoth the body characteristics studies and the genetic testing revealed four distinct coregonine species among the Lake Superior fish: Cisco, Bloater, Kiyi and, most surprisingly, Shortnose. The two studies matched the findings of one another \"to the 97th percentile,\" Gorman told fellow fisheries scientists at the Lake Superior Technical Committee.\n\nThe work provided some vindication to one of the forefathers of coregonine research, Walter Koeltz. A whitefish researcher at the University of Michigan's Institute for Fisheries Research in the 1920s, Koeltz published the seminal \"Coregonid Fishes of the Great Lakes\" in 1929, based on his observations.\n\n\"Anyone who is a student of ciscoes becomes a student of Koeltz,\" Gorman said. \"Koeltz's book on the Great Lakes coregonid fishes is kind of like a bible; you can talk about chapter and verse. You have to go back over and over to this work.\"\n\nBut among the coregonids Koeltz identified on Lake Superior was the Shortnose Cisco. When subsequent researchers, over decades, did not make similar findings, it was presumed Koeltz got it wrong.\n\nThe confirmed genetic and morphologic findings of Shortnose Cisco, some 100 years after Koeltz said they were there, means, \"in a sense, we have rediscovered Shortnose Cisco in Lake Superior,\" Gorman said.\n\nRestoring ciscoes points to Great Lakes health\n\nRestoring native cisco species to the Great Lakes may help turn the tide on a Great Lakes ecosystem disrupted over generations by significant invasive species, changing nutrient dynamics and other stresses, said Randall Claramunt, fisheries chief for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.\n\nThe DNR since 2018 has collected gametes \u2014 fertilized eggs \u2014 from a remaining population of wild cisco near Drummond Island in far northern Lake Huron, raised the fish at a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hatchery on the Jordan River in Antrim County, and then released 1 million young fish in the spring and fall into Saginaw Bay \u2014 a place where the cisco long ago thrived but were wiped out.\n\n\"We know if you catch a cisco in Saginaw Bay, it's likely from the stocking,\" Claramunt said.\n\n\"To see survival has been huge, because people thought, there's a lot of walleye in Saginaw Bay; there are a lot of predators on Lake Huron; and there are not a lot of prey fish.\"\n\nBut DNR officials have seen young, stocked cisco fish surviving, reaching adulthood, finding habitat.\n\n\"We are waiting for the last piece, which is: Are they successfully reproducing?\" Claramunt said. \"The next couple of years will be key to being able to detect successful reproduction.\"\n\nThe DNR considered a similar assist to cisco populations on the Lake Michigan side, he said. But in a surprise, the populations there have adapted to alewives and other invasive species and habitat changes and have begun a recovery on their own.\n\n\"They have just learned to adapt their life history to coexist with alewife,\" Claramunt said.\n\nFisheries managers around the Great Lakes have undertaken similar coregonine restoration efforts. In New York, state and federal researchers are attempting to restore Bloater, using eggs collected from northern Lake Michigan. Next year, cisco will also be experimentally reintroduced in the New York waters of Lake Erie, where the fish was once abundant but has since been wiped out.\n\nWhile some anglers grumble that they would like to see more effort placed on prized sports fish over ciscoes, Claramunt said the effort complements the Great Lakes' vital sports fishery.\n\n\"The Great Lakes will never go back to what they were 200 years ago,\" he said. \"After 60 or 70 years of trying to control sea lamprey, we control them every year but we still haven't eradicated them, along with the other invasive species.\n\n\"The idea is these native fish are very flexible; they occupy all of these different habitats and these different life strategies. Bringing them back now strategically will provide more stability for the Great Lakes in the future, and more resilience to future threats.\"\n\nContact Keith Matheny: kmatheny@freepress.com."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nMinerals are an example of a nonliving system that has increased in diversity and complexity over billions of years. Credit: Doug Bowman, CC BY\n\nWe have only one example of biology forming in the universe\u2014life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don't know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI'm an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I've learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there's advanced alien life out there, I'm on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy\u2014or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it's a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don't agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \"self-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\" That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter\u2014daily or weekly.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nEvolution is the process of change in systems. It can describe how a group of something becomes more complex \u2013 or even just different \u2013 over time.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet's atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA's definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe\u2014biological or not\u2014to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism's genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it's wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life's essential molecules\u2014at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they're unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they'll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth's crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt's unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that's for life as we know it\u2014for life as we don't know it, all bets are off.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "article_content": "Aqemia, a French startup that\u2019s meshing \u201cquantum-inspired physics\u201d with machine learning to find new drugs, has raised $38 million in a fresh round of funding led by San Francisco-based VC firm Cathay Innovation.\n\nThis is Aqemia\u2019s second fundraise of the year \u2014 it announced a \u20ac30 million ($31.5 million) raise back in January \u2014 and it takes the company\u2019s total funding raised past the $100 million mark.\n\nFounded in Paris by Maximilien Levesque and Emmanuelle Rolland-Martiano (pictured above) in 2019, Aqemia is one of countless startups applying AI to drug discovery. In 2024 alone, we\u2019ve seen the likes of Healx raise $47 million to tackle rare diseases; Sam Altman-backed Formation Bio raise $372 million; and Xaira emerge from stealth with a whopping $1 billion in funding.\n\nGoogle DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Director John Jumper, meanwhile, shared one-half of the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on Alphafold, an AI system that accurately predicts protein structures \u2014 vital for drug discovery.\n\nAqemia, for its part, says it\u2019s using physics and statistical mechanics algorithms to train a generative AI system, which then helps design potential drug candidates for \u201ccritical diseases.\u201d The initial focus is on oncology (cancer) and immuno-oncology (using the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer).\n\nThe company says this approach to training AI negates the need for experimental data, which is costly and time-consuming, and instead uses algorithms to essentially generate synthetic data to predict the properties of potential drug molecules and how they might interact with the target.\n\nLondon\u2019s calling\n\nIt\u2019s clear that AI-enabled drug discovery is a hot space right now, and Aqemia itself has already been making headway in industry. Last December, the startup signed a multi-year agreement with French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi, a deal that could be worth up to $140 million depending on the outcome of certain R&D milestones.\n\nWith a fresh $38 million in the bank, the company is now gearing up to bolster its recruitment efforts. That includes a new office in London that\u2019s set to open in early 2025 \u2014 a move designed to give Aqemia \u201caccess to the UK\u2019s rich talent pool,\u201d according to a press release. Having a global VC firm like Cathay Innovation on board could also open the door to new markets.\n\n\u201cLess than a year after our last round, this successful fundraising and the opening of our new London office mark significant strides toward our ambition to accelerate the discovery of new medicines on a global scale,\u201d Levesque said in a statement. \u201cPartnering with Cathay Innovation brings international expertise, particularly in the U.S. and Asia, reinforcing our vision and mission.\u201d\n\nAside from lead backer Cathay Innovation, Aqemia\u2019s latest round saw participation from existing investors Wendel, Bpifrance Large Venture, Eurazeo, and Elaia."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nFinding a reasonable hypothesis can pose a challenge when there are thousands of possibilities. This is why Dr. Joseph Sang-II Kwon is trying to make hypotheses in a generalizable and systematic manner.\n\nKwon, an associate professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, published his work on blending traditional physics-based scientific models with experimental data to accurately predict hypotheses in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering.\n\nKwon's research extends beyond the realm of traditional chemical engineering. By connecting physical laws with machine learning, his work could impact renewable energy, smart manufacturing, and health care, outlined in his recent paper, \"Adding big data into the equation.\"\n\nDeriving hypotheses for experimental observations typically involves a trial-and-error process. Kwon has developed a systematic framework that integrates specialized knowledge with experimental data to create a more efficient process.\n\n\"The most impactful aspect of this research is its ability to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexity, creating a versatile framework to solve intricate problems,\" Kwon said. \"This versatility means that the potential benefits could reach a wide range of industries and significantly impact daily life.\"\n\nThis research could lead to new drug discovery by incorporating experimental data into these models, Kwon said. This hybrid modeling approach integrates biological knowledge with data to accelerate drug predictions.\n\n\"Developing new drugs is expensive and time-consuming,\" Kwon said. \"But with more advanced models, we can accelerate the discovery and manufacturing processes. Leveraging simulations and machine learning reduces the need for costly lab experiments, saving time and speeding up the discovery of new treatments.\"\n\nHis approach combines physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven components that can adapt and correct predictions based on real-world experimental data.\n\nKwon plans to use these models as a backbone to simulate complex systems and capture underlying physical phenomena that traditional physics-based models cannot capture alone.\n\n\"This methodology allows us to continuously estimate process parameters alongside the hyperparameters of the data-driven component,\" Kwon said. \"By doing so, we ensure that the models are applicable to a wider range of conditions, making them more versatile and better suited to handle new and varied scenarios.\"\n\n\"Purely data-driven models fall short when it comes to capturing the intricacies of these systems,\" Kwon said. \"By blending the two approaches, we can improve the efficiency and reliability of industrial processes that are critical to producing everyday essentials such as energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\"\n\nMore information: Joseph Sang-Il Kwon, Adding big data into the equation, Nature Chemical Engineering (2024).

In a research paper published on Monday in the science journal Nature, Google said its machine had surpassed the \u201cerror correction threshold,\u201d a milestone that scientists have been working toward for decades.\n\nThat means quantum computers are on a path to a moment, still well into the future, when they can overcome their mistakes and perform calculations that could accelerate the progress of drug discovery. They could also break the encryption that protects computers vital to national security.\n\n\u201cWhat we really want these machines to do is run applications that people really care about,\u201d said John Preskill, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology who specializes in quantum computing. \u201cThough it still might be decades away, we will eventually see the impact of quantum computing on our everyday lives.\u201d\n\nA traditional computer like a laptop or a smartphone stores numbers in silicon chips and manipulates those numbers, adding them, multiplying them and so on. It performs these calculations by processing \u201cbits\u201d of information. Each bit holds either a 1 or a 0.\n\nBut a quantum computer defies common sense. It relies on the mind-bending ways that some objects behave at the subatomic level or when exposed to extreme cold, like the exotic metal that Google chills to nearly 460 degrees below zero inside its quantum computer."

            "article_content": "Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nIllustration by Midjourney.\n\nIn late 2022, the world collectively held its breath as a strange yet exciting new technology emerged from the depths of Silicon Valley. This was ChatGPT \u2014 an artificial intelligence chatbot that could write poetry, debug code, and summarize hundred-page novels with unnerving ease. It attracted a jaw-dropping 100 million users within weeks, breaking records for the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Investors, with visions of a technological revolution shimmering in their eyes (and dollar signs for pupils), began pouring fortunes into anything that bore the acronym \u201cAI.\u201d The future, it seemed, was already here.\n\nBut, as history reminds us with a wry smile, the future doesn\u2019t always arrive as advertised. As the markets ride a wave of AI-induced euphoria, voices of caution are growing louder. Is AI a transformative technology poised to rewrite our lives, or is it the scaffolding for the next catastrophic bubble \u2014 a modern-day echo of the dot-com collapse?\n\nEchoes of 1999\n\nThe numbers are staggering. In 2024, the S&P 500 is on track to close with a 27% gain, building on a 24% surge the year before. We haven\u2019t seen this kind of back-to-back bull run since the halcyon days of the late 1990s, when dot-com stocks inflated to absurd heights. For a brief moment, it seemed every startup with a \u201c.com\u201d in its name was a ticket to unimaginable wealth. But by early 2000, that story turned dark. The bubble popped, and what followed was a painful recession that many would rather forget. By 2002, investor losses were estimated at around $5 trillion. Today, a similar stock market wipeout could be much more dire.\n\nFor instance, at the peak of the dot-com frenzy, Pets.com seemed to embody the future of commerce. Who wouldn\u2019t want pet supplies delivered with just a few clicks? The company launched in 1998, armed with an irresistible mascot: a wide-eyed sock puppet with a penchant for witty banter. The puppet became a minor celebrity, starring in a $1.2 million Super Bowl ad and even appearing on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nBut beneath the charm lay a fragile business model. Shipping bulky bags of dog food wasn\u2019t cheap, and Pets.com sold products at a loss just to attract customers. Investors still believed in the vision, pumping $82.5 million into its IPO in February 2000. Nine months later, the company collapsed. The sock puppet, once a symbol of internet-age optimism, became the unwitting face of dot-com hubris.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia, the undisputed titan of AI hardware, have seen their market value soar to over $3 trillion. In just two years, Nvidia\u2019s stock has surged eightfold. Super Micro Computer, which provides the servers powering AI\u2019s voracious data needs, has followed a similar trajectory. The technology that underpins this growth is genuinely astounding. Yet, as the Associated Press notes, it\u2019s hard to ignore how similar these patterns feel to the 1999 bubble \u2014 a time when investors believed the early internet would mint millionaires out of thin air.\n\nEven the European Central Bank has begun sounding the alarm. In a recent financial review, the ECB warned of an AI stock bubble, suggesting that if AI firms don\u2019t start producing tangible profits, panic could ripple through the global economy. The more feverish the hype, the harder the fall if reality fails to deliver.\n\n\u201cThis concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble,\u201d the ECB said. \u201cAlso, in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments,\u201d the ECB said.\n\nAt the moment, there\u2019s just too much optimism and not enough recognition of what could derail stock momentum, experts seem to warn.\n\nIs This The World\u2019s Most Expensive Gamble?\n\nAnd yet, despite the red flags, the AI juggernaut barrels forward. According to estimates, spending on AI data centers from 2024 to 2027 will exceed $1.4 trillion. These facilities, filled with server racks humming under the weight of immense computation, are the new temples of progress. But as impressive as this investment sounds, only a sliver of American businesses \u2014 about 5% \u2014 have incorporated AI into their services.\n\nThe disparity between investor enthusiasm and business adoption is becoming hard to ignore. While ChatGPT dazzled millions, the electricity needed to train its underlying model, GPT-4, could have powered over three million electric vehicles for an entire year. OpenAI\u2019s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up 1,700 percent since the beginning of 2023 \u2014 but it expects to lose roughly $5 billion this year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses.\n\nEach new leap in AI capability requires ever more data, ever more energy, and ever more money. It\u2019s a cycle that feels less like a virtuous circle and more like an arms race, spiraling toward a point of diminishing returns.\n\nSome of these constraints are fueling an industry-wide scramble for efficiency. Companies are developing specialized chips and streamlined models to mitigate AI\u2019s insatiable hunger for resources. Yet, as of now, the promises are still largely theoretical.\n\nWhat happens if the money \u2014 and patience \u2014 runs out before the solutions arrive?\n\nThe Silent Revolution in the Office Cubicle\n\nCuriously, while corporations debate the merits of AI, employees are embracing it in secret. Studies suggest that a third of American workers use AI at least once a week, often without their bosses\u2019 knowledge. In some sectors, like software engineering, that figure climbs to nearly 80%. Employees are quietly deploying AI to write reports, debug code, and streamline tedious tasks, but they\u2019re keeping it under wraps, fearful that transparency could lead to heavier workloads or job losses. After all, why are you getting paid if most of your job can be done with the help of AI?\n\nThis clandestine adoption hints at a peculiar paradox: AI may be more disruptive than we realize, but the disruption is happening quietly, in the shadows of office cubicles. This isn\u2019t the AI revolution the hype trains promised. It\u2019s a whisper, not a roar.\n\nFor businesses, this means AI adoption is as much about culture as it is about technology. Companies that foster openness and experimentation could harness AI\u2019s full potential, while those clinging to old management styles might miss the boat entirely.\n\nThe Year of Reckoning?\n\nSo, what happens next? 2025 looms large. It could be the year AI makes good on its promise, with breakthroughs in fields as diverse as drug discovery and military defense. Or it could be the year the bubble finally bursts under the weight of unmet expectations.\n\nHistory offers no certainties, but it does offer patterns. The dot-com bubble wasn\u2019t just a story of irrational exuberance; it was also a story of real innovation that eventually found its footing. The internet did transform the world \u2014 just not in the exponential, uninterrupted path investors had hoped for. Perhaps AI is in for a similar treatment: a cataclysmic stock market crash that would hamper progress for a few years while at the same time sanitizing the industry by removing inefficient companies; then, only after a recovery, perhaps will AI make good on its many promises. Just like Pets.com was ahead of its time, so too maybe is the current AI hype train.\n\nThe hype may fade. Stocks may tumble. But beneath the surface, the technology could continue to mature, slowly and steadily finding its place in our lives. As the frenzy quiets down, we may discover that the most profound changes often happen in the spaces between bubbles \u2014 not with a pop, but with a quiet breath of reality."
