            "article_content": "If you\u2019re seeing and hearing drones or other such flying things flashing in the sky, it\u2019s absolutely certain that you are not imagining it and you are not alone. However, what remains troublingly uncertain is what is actually going on and it\u2019s a question that government has done a lousy job answering.\n\nThe future head of that government, Donald Trump, said yesterday: \u201cThe government knows what is happening. For some reason, they don\u2019t want to comment. And I think they\u2019d be better off saying what it is our military knows and our president knows.\u201d\n\nWe often disagree with Trump, but his call for transparency is sound.\n\nWhat do the sightings mean? Hopefully not a real life \u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d invasion copying Orson Welles\u2019 1938 fictional radio show Martian attack, also in New Jersey. The unsatisfying answer is we don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019ll venture that it\u2019s unlikely that this is some sort of sophisticated foreign intelligence operation that federal officials are somehow unaware of.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s some kind of undisclosed military program that Trump mentioned, or coordinated pranks or, as is may be the case with these things, a phenomenon that\u2019s taken a life of its own when there\u2019s no there there.\n\nA few experts and officials have already pointed out that at least some of the sightings seem to be commercial planes. One Jersey resident claimed to have shined a laser pointer at a \u201cdrone\u201d that seems to have really been a FedEx plane. Needless to say, do not do this; risking plane crashes is the opposite of helpful as we try to figure out what\u2019s going on.\n\nThis is all representative of a broader and more acute reality than whatever is going on with these particular sightings: we have more or less lost the ability to contend with and clarify things like this as a society. Conspiracy theories are nothing new, and neither is distrusting official sources of information. Some of our greatest advances as a society and moments of public accountability and reform have come from people going against and questioning narratives.\n\nInstead, we\u2019re faced with something like a choose-your-own-adventure for reality, where every amateur sleuth and social media voice gets a chance to run wild and potentially cause significant damage with their laser pointer exploits.\n\nThe culture of secrecy at the nation\u2019s law enforcement and military entities has left them tight-lipped in a way that the public just takes as confirmation that there\u2019s something nefarious going on, as Trump suggests, and the news media\u2019s cautious reporting, responsive to what we know to be true, is seen as evasive and dismissive.\n\nPeople want there to be clear-cut answers, now. The idea that this could be a series of misidentifications of commercial planes, faraway planets and hobbyists drones (or probably all of the above) even if that turns out to be the correct answer, may not be welcomed by a public that seems hungry for something else.\n\nSo, let\u2019s just go through each sighting, one by one, and determine its cause. The Martians patiently planned their attack in \u201cThe War of the Worlds;\u201d will Americans have the same level of patience?"

            "article_content": "By now you\u2019ve heard about the many unidentified and flying objects in the dark skies over New Jersey. The reports are certainly amazing.\n\nSome people believe those in-the-air objects are space aliens. Others blame terrestrial foreigners. A member of Congress \u2014 Rep. Jeff Drew, R-N.J. \u2014 has fingered the lights as drones from an Iranian mothership floating off the Atlantic coast, which nobody can find.\n\nWhatever they are, President-elect Donald Trump says those things in New Jersey\u2019s skies should be shot down.\n\nNaturally, this newspaper treats reports of flying saucers with all the seriousness they deserve, just like we did 60 years ago.\n\nAnd back then, if you recall, the UFOs were landing in the Old Dominion. Allegedly, they made at least a couple pit stops in the Shenandoah Valley in 1964.\n\nThe first Western Virginia UFO sighting that we know of in the 1960s occurred that December. Perhaps not coincidentally, it followed reports of other alien spacecraft sightings in various and sundry locations across the United States.\n\nHorace Burns was the first and only person to claim to have seen the Western Virginia UFO. His account was later supported by a professor from Eastern Mennonite University, Ernest Gehman.\n\nIt happened after dusk on Dec. 21, 1964, just four days before Christmas. Burns, who lived in Grottoes but owned a gun shop in Harrisonburg, was driving his car on U.S. 250 from Staunton to Waynesboro.\n\nThe account later appeared on page 14 of The Roanoke World-News on Jan. 15, 1965, under the headline, \u201cMan Tells Of Encounter With \u2018Flying Saucer.\u2019\u201d\n\nBurns was driving east, as a huge object in the sky crossed over the highway and landed in a large field in Fisherville. At that instant, his Mercury station wagon conked out in what newspaper writers later termed \u201can electromagnetic effect\u201d common with UFO sightings.\n\nBurns later said \u201cwhen the object passed over him he felt a definite force exerted on his automobile as if it had been struck by a blast of air,\u201d according to the article.\n\nHe pulled over and got out of the station wagon. He said the spacecraft was about 100 yards from the road. It was not minivan sized, as observers from New Jersey have characterized the most recent UFO sightings.\n\nRather, according to Burns, the spacecraft was circular shaped, 80 to 90 feet tall and 125 feet in diameter. Burns said he observed no doors or windows, but did see an eerie blue light emanating from the craft. News accounts described the spaceship as resembling a huge beehive.\n\n\u201cIt rested on the ground for about one-and-a-half minutes then rose slowly in the air for several hundred feet then suddenly shot off in a 90-degree turn toward the northeast at a very rapid pace,\u201d according to the article.\n\nAfter the spaceship took off, Burns was surprised that his car started. He drove home and told his wife the story, according to a typewritten report later prepared by Gehman and forwarded to the National Investigating Committee on Aerial Phenomena, aka NICAP.\n\nAt first, Burns told his wife he planned to tell nobody about what he\u2019d witnessed because \u201cThey\u2019d think I\u2019m crazy,\u201d Gehman\u2019s report to NICAP stated. But a few nights later, they heard a news report on WSVA, the television station in Harrisonburg.\n\nIt was about a new club that had formed at then-Eastern Mennonite College to investigate UFOs. For some reason, Gehman, who taught German, was involved in it.\n\nBurns contacted the TV station, which put him in touch with Gehman. Gehman later recorded Burns\u2019s story. Gehman also took a Geiger counter to the landing site and claimed it detected high levels of radioactivity.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help feeling there\u2019s a prophetic significance to these sightings,\u201d Gehman was quoted telling The World-News the a Jan. 15, 1965 article.\n\n\u201cGehman said it could possibly foretell the second coming of Christ,\u201d the article noted. \u201cHe quoted a passage from the New Testament which said there will be signs in the heavens before Christ returns to earth.\u201d\n\nBy Jan. 7, the United States Air Force was involved. It sent a team from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside Dayton, Ohio, to investigate.\n\nThough the Air Force brought radiation-detecting equipment, it found zero evidence an alien spacecraft visited the Fisherville site where Gehman said his Geiger Counter had gone nuts the previous month.\n\nAmong other things, an Air Force team found no increased radioactivity, which Gehman chalked up to 6 inches of snow falling in the interim. (Gehman accompanied the investigators.)\n\nBy Jan 24, the reports about UFOs in Virginia had multiplied. \u201c10 More People Report UFOs,\u201d an article in The Roanoke Times found.\n\nThat\u2019s often the way mass hysteria works \u2014 one report prompts many more, and they feed upon each other.\n\nOne of the subsequent sightings concerned \u201cthree little men\u201d who allegedly disembarked from two flying saucers and walked around Augusta County. The other UFO reports were of suspicious flying objects seen above Williamsburg, in the sky over Langley Air Force Base, and above Verona and Waynesboro.\n\nOn Jan. 28, The Roanoke Times carried a headline at the top of page 15, \u201cAir Force Says No Evidence of UFO Landing in Augusta.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Air Force Investigators said they could find no other witnesses to the object,\u201d the story noted. \u201cThey felt that since (Horace) Burns estimated the object to be 125 feet in diameter and 80 to 90 feet high it would have been seen by other people.\u201d\n\nThe story seemed to formally put the kibosh on Burns\u2019 tale. Ironically, however, it appeared on the same page as three other stories about UFO sightings in Virginia.\n\nOne was headlined \u201c\u2018Little Men\u2019 spotted, Say Augusta Boys.\u201d Another read, \u201cPastor Says Object Seen At Marion.\u201d The third was datelined Hampton, and was an Associated Press report. \u201cEx AF Pilot Sights \u2018Saucer,\u2019\u201d the headline read.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the way UFO headlines have read pretty much ever since \u2014 including 60 years later."

            "article_content": "In today\u2019s rapidly changing technology landscape, machine learning and AI enable us to redefine industries and change how we interact with the world. AI allows developers to create more intelligent, flexible, and efficient applications. Arm, due to its unique position in the industry, has been enabling AI across a variety of platforms for more than a decade.\n\nIn this article, I want to detail how Arm\u2019s technology allows developers to focus on innovation and the unique aspects of the applications they are developing while utilizing Arm\u2019s existing technology.\n\nYou don\u2019t need an NPU for AI applications For over seven years, I\u2019ve been making content about the advantages and disadvantages of different machine learning accelerators \u2014 called NPUs. These processors have their place in devices, but one myth is that you need one to run machine learning or AI tasks. That\u2019s simply not true. AI tasks don\u2019t hinge exclusively on NPUs; they can run on anything from a CPU to a GPU. With the technology found in Arm v8 and Arm v9 chips, you can run accelerated machine learning tasks particularly well on Arm CPUs.\n\nMatrix multiplication is the key mathematical operation at the heart of machine learning and AI. GPUs and NPUs are good at matrix multiplication. However, modern Arm CPUs are also good at this processing task and have hardware accelerators that enable it, too. Whether it\u2019s Arm v8 or Arm v9, Cortex-A or Cortex-X, or Arm\u2019s Neoverse processors, they all have different technologies that allow the acceleration of matrix multiplication operations.\n\nFor example, Arm\u2019s Neon technology, and Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) are both available in Arm processors, there are also 8-bit matrix-by-matrix multiplication instructions in the Arm instruction set. In smartphones and on the edge devices, Scalable Matrix Extensions (SME) are available inside Arm processors. These technologies allow the CPU to perform accelerated matrix operations without a GPU or NPU.\n\nArm\u2019s Kleidi technology\n\nArm\n\nBeyond the hardware systems, Kleidi is a central part of Arm\u2019s strategy for enabling AI on Arm-based mobile and server platforms. It covers a range of resources and partnerships for helping developers accelerate AI seamlessly on Arm, including a library of high-performance machine learning kernels called KleidiAI, which has been optimized for Arm CPUs using those various hardware accelerators.Kleidi is available on GitLab, and these kernels have been integrated into various frameworks that are ready for developers to use. As a result, we now have hardware acceleration for Arm CPUs, supporting various machine learning technologies, from classical machine learning to current generative AI.\n\nArm has integrated Kleidi technology into popular AI frameworks such as PyTorch and ExecuTorch, resulting in significant out-of-the-box performance improvements for developers. This integration ensures that developers can seamlessly leverage Arm\u2019s optimized libraries within their existing workflows, gaining up to a 12x performance improvement with minimal effort.\n\nArm partnered with Meta to ensure the recently launched Llama 3.2 model works perfectly on Arm CPUs. The availability of smaller LLMs that enable fundamental text-based generative AI workloads, such as the one billion and three billion parameter versions, is critical for enabling AI inference at scale. Arm CPUs can run larger models, such as Llama 3.2 with 11 billion parameters and even the 90 billion parameter model in the cloud. These larger models are an excellent fit for CPU-based inference workloads in the cloud that generate text and images.\n\nThe 11 billion parameter version of Llama 3.2, running on an Amazon AWS Graviton4 processor, can achieve 29.3 tokens per second during the generation phase, and that\u2019s just on the CPU. Thanks to the collaboration between Arm and Meta on the ExecuTorch framework, you can now access optimal performance by running those models on the edge. Running the new Llama 3.2 three billion LLM on an Arm-powered smartphone through the Arm CPU optimizations leads to a 5x improvement in prompt processing and a 3x improvement in token generation, achieving 19.92 tokens per second during the generation phase.\n\nIf you want a demonstration of this, check out my video above.\n\nA massive boost for developers\n\nArm\n\nThanks to these advancements, the possibilities for developers are enormous. Think of everything you could do with a large language model running on a phone using an Arm CPU \u2014 no GPU, no NPU, no cloud, just the CPU. Arm\u2019s approach is performance portability, which means that AI developers can optimize once and then deploy their models across various platforms without making any modifications. This is particularly useful for developers who need to deploy models both on the edge, in a smartphone, and in the cloud. By using Arm, developers can be sure that their model will also perform well on other platforms once optimized for one platform.\n\nArm has some great resources for developers, including documentation on how to accelerate generative AI and ML workloads when you choose to run them on Arm CPUs, in addition to running AI and ML on Android devices."

Photo: RTHK\n\nThe University of Hong Kong has developed a new AI-powered mobile app that it says can reliably assess the oral health of patients in seconds.\n\n\n\nOver the next three months, volunteers are hoping to use the app to help hundreds of elderly patients who have difficulty visiting a dentist \u2013 by making home visits or at three service locations in Lam Tin and Kwun Tong.\n\n\n\nStudents from HKU\u2019s dentistry faculty are partnering up with legislators and district councillors to identify elderly people in need of help.\n\n\n\nThe volunteers would then do a quick test simply by taking photos of the patients\u2019 mouths and running it through the app \u2013 called GUM AI \u2013 which would then make an accurate assessment of the state of their teeth and gums.\n\n\n\nNo professional training is needed \u2013 the app simply displays red for poor oral health, yellow when caution is required, and green means everything looks fine.\n\n\n\nThe service teams would then give advice to the patients, or refer them to a dentist if needed.\n\n\n\nHKU researcher Walter Lam says the technology could make a real difference.\n\n\n\n\"We hope the GUM AI can raise health awareness among those elderly, so that they can have a regular dental visit, and they can self-care their hygiene, which is quite important to prevent any oral diseases,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDevelopers of the app say it has proven to be highly reliable, with a 90-percent accuracy rate.\n\n\n\n\"The accuracy of our AI system is comparable to experienced dentists,\" Lam said.\n\n\n\nThe team is aiming to expand the use of the app to other age groups after the end of the three-month pilot project. They say the technology promises to reduce waiting times for oral check-ups, and can help people better monitor their oral health and get treatment early."

He said he was trying to track a mystery drone but his drone was shut down while the mystery thing remained airborne.\"There was a drone just hanging out,\" he told FOX 5 New York. \"I had full battery life. Not 3 minutes into the flight, I lost control of the drone.\"He said he saw a warning flash across the screen of his controller and the battery died with the drone coming down. He understood that his drone was probably shot down because it was a restricted flight area but the thing that he was trying to approach continued to fly. The paranormal investigator lives near the Picatinny Arsenal, an Army facility near where dozens of sightings have been reported in recent weeks. Since it was an Army area, it was possible that his drone was shut down but the other one continuing to fly seems to establish speculation theories that these mystery drones are probably sanctioned by the government and the Feds are well aware of them.As Michael B shared his horrifying experience with MSNBC, he said the issue, to him, seems more serious than just misidentified aircraft. \"At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,\" he said adding that he could not figure out what it was.Michael B added that it's clear to him that these mystery drones are capable of flying in restricted zones. He said he can usually detect what other objects are on the sky by using his radar, none of these mystery things are on flight radar."

(Representational image)\n\nA drone pilot from New Jersey has described his encounter with a mysterious object near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military facility where unexplained drone sightings have been increasing.\n\nMichael B, a paranormal investigator and podcaster behind the YouTube channel \u2018Terror Talk Productions\u2019, was trying to examine a suspicious flying object when his drone malfunctioned unexpectedly.\n\nrelated stories\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Michael B said that he was flying his drone near the restricted airspace of Picatinny Arsenal when he noticed a mysterious device hovering nearby. \u201cThere was a drone just hanging out\u2026 I had full battery life. Not 3 minutes into the flight, I lost control of the drone,\" he said.\n\nShortly after, a warning flashed on his screen, and his drone suddenly started descending due to a dead battery. However, the unknown object he was investigating remained in the air, sparking more questions about its origin.\n\nAlthough drones are typically grounded or forced to land when they enter restricted airspace, the mysterious object\u2019s ability to stay airborne while Michael B\u2019s drone malfunctioned is raising concerns.\n\nThe rise in reported drone sightings near Picatinny Arsenal has led to an official investigation, with authorities looking into the possible causes.\n\nAn army spokesperson confirmed that a temporary flight restriction had been imposed over Picatinny Arsenal, effective till December 26, following the recent increase in drone activity.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is also investigating the incidents and has introduced additional flight restrictions around the area, including over the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster.\n\nThe series of unexplained drone sightings has sparked public concern, with New Jersey State Senator Joe Pennacchio calling for a federal investigation. He even sent a letter to President-elect Donald Trump, urging action over the lack of answers regarding the mysterious drones.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nWhile the origins of the drones in New Jersey remain unclear, John Kirby, the White House national security communications adviser, stated that many of the reported sightings may be of manned aircraft operating legally.\n\nDespite this, former CIA operations officer Laura Ballman speculated that the unidentified drones could be part of a secretive technology test aimed at avoiding detection or being detected.\n\nLocation : United States of America (USA)\n\nFirst Published: December 17, 2024, 16:31 IST"

            "article_content": "Scientists have announced the discovery of a species of lipstick vine that is completely new to science, found in the depths of the Philippine rainforest.\n\nThis species, which has never been documented in botanical records, has sparked a wave of excitement among scientists and nature enthusiasts alike.\n\nAn expedition into the heart of Luzon\n\nA daring expedition by a team of botanists in 2022 led them into Barangay Balbalasang rainforest, a remote and virtually inaccessible part of Luzon island.\n\nThe journey began with days of rugged travel to reach the rainforest, which was filled with unforgiving thickets that demanded to be sliced with machetes. In these wild conditions, the researchers discovered their prize.\n\nThe team included Jayson Mansibang, Adriane Tobias, and Pastor L. Malabrigo from the University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os, along with Dr. Chris Thorogood, Deputy Director and Head of Science at the Oxford Botanic Garden and Arboretum.\n\nThe researchers stayed with the Banao Tribe, an indigenous community that protects the local forest.\n\nA lipstick vine unlike any other\n\nAmong the species found in the forest, one stood out \u2013 a specimen of the lipstick vine, a genus known as Aeschynanthus.\n\nThis plant had a distinct pattern of delicate purple mottling which painted its flowers in a pattern similar to that of a European foxglove.\n\n\u201cWe were trekking through dense vegetation when suddenly we spotted a luminous white, purple-spotted flower dangling above our heads,\u201d said Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cWe suspected immediately that it was new to science. It\u2019s so exciting that beautiful species like this are still there waiting to be described.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of a new lipstick vine\n\nThe team named the plant Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus from the Latin \u2018penta,\u2019 meaning five, and \u2018trichomatus\u2019 referring to the trichomes \u2013 hair-like outgrowths deep in the throats of the flowers.\n\nLipstick vines, encompassing nearly 180 tropical and subtropical species, are known for their tubular, bud-like appearance.\n\nThese vines, often adorning other plants and trees, boast vibrantly colored flowers that attract birds for pollination.\n\nConservation concerns amid climate change\n\nSadly, this newfound beauty already faces a critical risk of extinction. Rapid climate change, driving increasingly intense typhoons, relentlessly threatens the plant\u2019s natural habitat.\n\nThe Barangay Balbalasang rainforest remains remarkably intact, housing numerous species that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The researchers hope that the new discovery can help support conservation efforts to protect the region.\n\n\u201cWe dedicate this discovery not only to the unique beauty of the Banao forest but also to the Banao People themselves, who, through their care and stewardship, have ensured the conservation of rare species within these precious forests,\u201d said Tobias.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to find Aeschynanthus in such an environment, and as young botanists, we were thrilled to discover something so distinct.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s plant data darkspots\n\n\u201cMany new species remain undocumented in the world\u2019s \u2018plant data darkspots\u2019 \u2013 up to 15% of the world\u2019s flora in fact,\u201d noted Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cFinding these \u2018known unknowns\u2019 is essential for understanding and protecting biodiversity. That\u2019s what makes discoveries such as this one so important for conservation science.\u201d\n\nEcological importance of lipstick vines\n\nThe discovery of Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus sheds light on the ecological importance of lipstick vines in tropical ecosystems.\n\nAs epiphytes, these plants grow on trees without harming them, creating microhabitats that support diverse wildlife.\n\nTheir vividly colored flowers play a vital role in attracting pollinators, particularly birds, which are essential for maintaining the delicate balance of tropical rainforests.\n\nBeyond their ecological contributions, lipstick vines are indicators of environmental health. Their presence often signifies a well-preserved ecosystem, as these plants thrive only in stable and intact habitats.\n\nProtecting a unique rainforest\n\nThe discovery of this new species in Barangay Balbalasang emphasizes the rainforest\u2019s unique biodiversity and the urgent need to safeguard it.\n\nWith nearly 180 known species of Aeschynanthus, each adapted to its specific environment, the newly discovered species offers valuable insights into the evolution of plant-pollinator relationships and the resilience of tropical flora in the face of climate change.\n\nProtecting Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus is not just about preserving a single species; it is about safeguarding the intricate web of life that it supports.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Nordic Journal of Botany.\n\nImage Credit: Chris Thorogood\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

However, people can\u2019t hibernate for a few reasons: Our bodies can\u2019t store enough fat without harming ourselves, function at such low energy and brain activity levels, or survive a massive drop in body temperature.

            "article_content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nAfter months of waiting, it finally happened \u2014 OpenAI launched its video generator, Sora. Or, at least, it opened up access to the tool, only for the entire internet to jump on board simultaneously, forcing OpenAI to pump the brakes on account creation. Thanks to a little bit of patience and determination, I\u2019ve made my way through the waitlist, and now I have the power to generate just about anything I can think up \u2014 within some well-defined limits.\n\nWith that great power and responsibility has come something else, though: a great learning curve. Even though I\u2019m enjoying Sora and am impressed by its capabilities, I\u2019m having trouble nailing down the perfect prompts to get videos I\u2019m pleased with. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a matter of practice, but here\u2019s how my first few days with Sora have gone.\n\nHave you used OpenAI's Sora to generate videos yet? 47 votes Yes 32 % No 68 %\n\nVideo creation at your fingertips?\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about how Sora works \u2014 or at least how to access the powerful video generation tool. Although it comes from OpenAI, and you need to be a ChatGPT Plus or Pro member to start creating, you can\u2019t get to Sora through the main ChatGPT interface. Instead, you have to head directly to the Sora website (sora.com), where you\u2019re met with a gallery of Featured clips that set the bar incredibly high.\n\nAt least, they set the bar high in my own head. I scrolled through a few of them, looked at their prompts, watched them run smoothly, and figured I could do the same. After all, my prompts would be run through the same adaptation of DALL-E 3 that theirs had been, so they should look just as good, right? It\u2019s not quite that easy. Sure, typing in prompts is quite easy, but figuring out what Sora responds best to is a bit harder.\n\nCreating videos is as easy as typing out what you want to see... or at least it seems that way on paper.\n\nBefore we get to the challenges, though, I should probably clarify some of Sora\u2019s current limitations. Unlike Google\u2019s Pixel Studio or another basic image generator, you can\u2019t simply sit and run Sora to your heart\u2019s content \u2014 at least not as a ChatGPT Plus member for $20 per month.\n\nInstead, you\u2019re given a bank of 1,000 credits, which you can spend on video generation as you see fit. Everything you change within your prompt, from the aspect ratio to the duration to the resolution, will cost a certain number of those credits until you run out for the month. Brand new videos cost anywhere from 20 credits to 2,000 credits, and you can check out a helpful table of costs here \u2014 something I wish I\u2019d found before I spent 260 credits in about 20 minutes. You\u2019re also limited to one video generation at a time and a maximum resolution of 720p as a Plus member.\n\nIf you spring for a ChatGPT Pro membership, the limits are much looser but the price is much, much higher at $200 per month. Instead of 1,000 credits, you get 10,000 credits for priority videos, after which you get unlimited video generations; they just take a bit longer \u2014 OpenAI calls them \u201crelaxed videos.\u201d Pro members can also generate five videos at a time, bump them up to 1080p, and let them run as long as 20 seconds.\n\nUnfortunately, though, no matter what tier of ChatGPT you pay for, none of Sora\u2019s videos have audio to them, so you\u2019ll have to download your clips and sync music or sound effects after you\u2019ve nailed down the visuals. OpenAI has suggested that support for audio will reach Sora eventually, it\u2019s just not there yet.\n\nHow hard could it be?\n\nWith that basic introduction out of the way, the rest of using Sora to generate videos should be easy, right? Well, yes and no. Although typing in your prompt, choosing your settings from the menu at the bottom, and waiting for your video to generate is that easy, it\u2019s much harder to come up with something worthy of Sora\u2019s ever-changing Featured feed.\n\nIn an attempt to share my limited cache of tokens for the month, as soon as I got access to Sora, I reached out to my colleague Mitja. He and I had been discussing how quickly we might get access to the platform, so I figured he might have some good ideas for generations right off the bat. As it turned out, his first thought was something I never could have imagined: Ten zebras in suits dancing to a Michael Jackson song in front of the Sydney Opera House while eating pesto ravioli. It may seem like a weird video to make, but if Sora can handle that amount of detail, then it\u2019s definitely the real deal.\n\nSora will take a stab at almost anything you ask for, but you have to describe it just right.\n\nOnce I finished laughing at the idea, I ran it through Sora and waited for the result. Technically, the final product got most things right. It put a group of zebras in suits in front of the Sydney Opera House, and they all had green plates in their hands. However, the number fluctuated between eight and about 12 zebras, there was no indication that it was a Michael Jackson song, and the pesto ravioli was definitely just a green plate \u2014 close, but not quite right. More worryingly, I had bumped the cost of the video up to 100 tokens because I hoped a ten-second clip would show more dancing. It had not.\n\nI\u2019ve since learned, however, that Sora\u2019s Storyboard tool is a must-have for pretty much anything involving complex motion. It allows you to drag and drop clips along your five- or ten-second timeline, helping Sora break up the action and flow from one direction to another. So, in an attempt to draw a little bit more action out of my zebra friends, I jumped into the storyboard and split the dancing and the pesto ravioli into two separate actions spaced out over the five-second clip, then I used ChatGPT to punch up my description \u2014 yet another built-in feature of the Storyboard.\n\nOnce again\u2026 It kind of worked, but it kind of didn\u2019t. Yes, I got the zebras, and they were in front of the Sydney Opera House, but they had given up on dancing, and when asked to eat some of their ravioli, they suddenly grew human hands to hold their forks. Sorry, Featured feed, but I think I\u2019m a long way off.\n\nI\u2019ve also tried more natural prompts, like macaroni penguins sliding down icebergs into the sea, and more fantastical prompts, like a piece of toast with a Pixar-like face leaping out of a toaster, and the story has mostly been the same. Sora handles some pieces of each prompt incredibly well, but you have to describe your scene with just the right amount of detail. Too much, and Sora begins to merge different elements. Too little, and you get a relatively boring finished product.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, there\u2019s even more to Sora than I\u2019ve touched, especially when it comes to editing. The video generator also packs the ability to re-cut, remix, and blend clips to expand on an idea, join one video to another, or clip out elements that don\u2019t work well. But again, I\u2019d still like to nail down a video that looks good the first time.\n\nChallenges aside, I\u2019m excited for the future\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nOverall, it\u2019s fair to call my first few days using Sora a mixed bag. Has the video generator been perfect? No, but I can\u2019t entirely blame OpenAI for that. This is my first shot at generating videos based purely on text, so I\u2019m not surprised that I\u2019ve struggled to nail down the right level of detail. So far, I\u2019ve given Sora too much information, and I\u2019ve given it too little, which means that nailing just the right prompt has to be around the corner.\n\nMore importantly, though, I\u2019ve been thoroughly impressed by what Sora promises to do. The videos I can create as a ChatGPT Plus member take mere moments to conjure, and I imagine they\u2019ll get faster as the model continues its training. I\u2019m not entirely sure that I\u2019d use any of the speedy clips that Sora has cooked up just yet \u2014 many of them still suffer from weird artifacts like the human arms appearing on my zebras \u2014 but the clips that do make it to Sora\u2019s Featured collection give me hope that it\u2019s just a matter of learning how to ask for the right elements.\n\nI'm impressed by Sora, but I have a lot of learning to do.\n\nAlong with that, I won\u2019t be surprised if the way OpenAI handles prompts and creations opens up, too. Right now, when you burn through your 1,000 credits as a ChatGPT Plus member, that\u2019s it \u2014 there\u2019s no way to buy a few more until your billing period rolls over. Likewise, there\u2019s no way to roll unused credits from one month to the next, so you have to find the right balance of spending and saving to make it through the month.\n\nIf it were up to me, I\u2019d sure like to reclaim a few of the sillier credits I\u2019ve spent, but that\u2019s not an option. Instead, I\u2019ll call it the cost of learning, and I\u2019ll just have to take a little bit more time to fine-tune my prompts before I send them off to Sora. Maybe one day, I\u2019ll come up with something worth featuring.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

            "article_content": "For the past nine months, Inbal Shani has been the Chief Product Officer and Head of R&D at Twilio, a customer engagement platform (CEP). She's already working hard to build a trusted platform that leverages AI to support a constantly shifting customer engagement market.\n\nShani previously worked at Github, where she was responsible for what is now called Copilot (along with other platform elements). She has over twenty years of experience in AI/ML and has been through every phase of AI growth, from neural networks to deep learning, predictive, and now generative AI. Shani's experience spans industries including aerospace, automotive, robotics, retail, cloud developer tools, and now communications and data. In all her work, she has looked at how AI can improve the business.\n\nTwilio has created trends and followed trends. But as it looks to the future, it's all about building \"one platform that is trusted, simple, and smart.' Shani argue that every company has to leverage AI, but many are taking the wrong approach.\n\nThe questions companies do ask focus more on AI and how to monetize it. The questions they should be asking are: what is the value-add that automation or having a conversational agent brings to the customer experience, and how are you using AI as a tool? How will AI make you more productive, remove friction, or provide a better customer experience?\n\nIt\u2019s the difference, she says, between successful and less successful companies. If you are grounded by the customer problem you're trying to solve and figuring out how AI can help solve that problem, you will realize ROI and see successful adoption. Companies that sprinkle a little generative AI on something that doesn't materialize into a product or feature that customers want to adopt and buy will struggle.\n\nThe other challenge she sees is that the AI strategy doesn't necessarily align with the company strategy.\n\nI think that's the biggest kind of difference in terms of perspective on AI; AI is a very useful tool. It's a very powerful tool. And you need to know how to use these tools to solve problems. But it's not a magic solution for everything, and it's not a magical solution that is going to solve everything. So, knowing how to use it in a smart way to really focus on the customer. If it's better user experience, if it's better productivity, if it's creating shorter time to value because of automation, then you have a successful AI strategy.\n\nShani says Twilio is successful because it uses AI as a tool to improve customer engagement, security, and customer satisfaction.\n\nHow Twilio CEP uses AI\n\nTwilio is not for one department. It provides the tools to support the customer end-to-end. The CDP (customer data platform) gives them customer data, and the CPaaS (communications platform as a service) provides the \"last mile connection\" - email, SMS, and voice interactions. Bringing them together creates customer engagement across the entire customer lifecycle. AI is used throughout the CEP. Shani cites the example of Fraud Guard, Twilio\u2019s first product to market, which provides SMS protection. They developed predictive AI models for this product, which they continually tune:\n\nIn Twilio, for example, in our Fraud Guard product that I mentioned before. It was never about, okay, how do we monetize predictive AI? We were grounded in solving a problem that was real and increasing, especially now in the age of AI, of spam, and impersonation. So when we built Fraud Guard, it was always the intention: how do we protect our customers, how do we create these secure communications, and we see real value? We see real savings for our customers who are using the product. And they never once asked us, are you using LLMs? Are you using predictive AI? It was not even a question. So, it was not about how you're monetizing it. But it's more in terms of what is the value that I'm getting?\n\nBut Shani is also looking into leveraging AI in the Segment business, focusing on customer data and engagement. Here, predictive audiences help companies understand what their customers are trying to do, how they will behave, and what the next best action for them is.\n\nIn addition, Twilio has launched generative AI products across communications, including their personalized IVR and Flex contact center product with a copilot agent. In this product, an AI assistant helps agents be more helpful to customers by providing advice and recommendations, sentiment analysis, and summarizing conversations.\n\nWhat\u2019s changing for developers\n\nWith a ten-million-strong developer community, it makes sense that Shani would have a strong view of how AI is affecting developers.\n\nWe are hearing more and more that in the next five years, everyone will be a developer. Shani doesn\u2019t agree. She reckons there is a big difference between a developer and a builder. Yes, everyone can use an AI tool and build something, she said. You can write better content and better code, but that doesn\u2019t make you a software developer:\n\nIt's kind of a new language that developers need to learn how to use and how to use it well.\n\nShani pitches that AI is a productivity and assistant tool, with rhe caveat that you need to know what questions to ask to get the right answer.\n\nYou see the evolution of software development languages all the time. And I think when I'm looking from a software developer perspective, what we see right now, with all these copilot assistants to write code, is really about making a developer much more productive so they can focus on getting the full value out of their time writing code which is something that they didn't have before.\n\nShani sees three themes in how AI is impacting software development. First, developers need enough software skills to validate that the AI-generated code is good and does what they want it to.\n\nSecond, AI uses data to create code, but there\u2019s a creative aspect to people that Shani doesn\u2019t see AI replacing in the near future.\n\nFinally, Shani believes there will be a shift in how developers think about code. Before, it was all about generating code to solve a problem. Now, it\u2019s thinking about systems design and overall architecture from the start. And it\u2019s about user experience, something that is becoming very critical in the world of AI, she said.\n\nWhat does this mean for developers exactly?\n\nShe explains:\n\nIf we're using an AI tool to write a document, we don't just copy, paste, and call it done. The same needs to be done in code. You have to validate whatever the AI assistant has been generating. I think that's one element. And the second thing that I advise computer science students asking me similar questions is you need to learn the basics without AI. You need to learn how to be a software developer before you earn the right to use an AI tool because you need to be able to look into the code. You need to be able to look into the product that you have generated and know if it's good or not. Because, if not, and that goes back to then, we don't really need you because that's the validation that is missing if you delegate the entire creation of a code to an AI assistant.\n\nThe key to consider here is how students are taught computer science today. Not all universities have embraced AI trends\u2014not for developers, marketers, or writers. Shani said she is seeing some effort to figure it out. But there is a balance to find. You want students to learn to code without AI first, but you also want them to learn to leverage AI tools to help them be more productive and efficient.\n\nAt the same time, these schools also need to devote more teaching time to the thinking and designing aspects of systems development. There aren't likely many schools teaching user experience in computer science courses\u2014at least not as a core subject.\n\nMy take\n\nI appreciated Shani's perspective on how organizations should think about AI. By focusing on the customer and creating better experiences, it's easy to find ways to leverage AI. Incorporating AI into a product without thinking about what benefits it truly brings may have been okay at first, but it isn't the right approach today.\n\nI also liked how she talked about developers' use of AI. This is very similar to how content marketers and writers can use AI\u2014as an assistant, as another tool. It doesn't replace the need to understand the work; it's simply a way to take more of the basic operations out of the hands of developers so they can spend more time designing products and experiences that customers will love.\n\nDoes this mean companies won't replace developers? Not necessarily. As I have said before, with AI and writers, some will get replaced. It's just the way things go. What developers want to do is find the companies that understand the true value of AI in the toolkit. And it sounds like Twilio is one of those companies."

People who are eligible also should have received an emailed notice about the class action settlement.\n\nIf you are still unsure about whether you\u2019re eligible for the settlement, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at 1-866-944-4062.\n\nAccording to the official website, $9 million of the proposed settlement has been set aside for cash payments to people affected by the data breach. The amount of money each person can receive is capped at $25, the website says.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t submit claims for cash payments will receive $1 credits from ParkMobile via email.\n\nHow to submit a claim\n\nPeople who are eligible for the settlement must submit a claim by Wednesday, March 5, 2025, the settlement website says.\n\nYou can submit a claim online using the ID and confirmation code on your mailed or emailed notice. If you don\u2019t have the notice ID and confirmation code, you can look up your login by entering your name and email address.\n\nYou can also print out a claim form here and mail it postmarked no later than March 5 to this address: ParkMobile Data Security Incident, Attn: Claim Forms, 1650 Arch Street, Suite 2210, Philadelphia, PA 19103.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when people who are eligible for the settlement could receive their payments."

            "article_content": "The Hubble tension is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology.\n\nIt centers around the Hubble constant\u2014the measurement of how fast our universe is expanding\u2014which comes out as two different numbers when calculated two different ways, even though those numbers should always match.\n\nNow, the James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that this tension is real, rather than a miscalculation or a problem with our equipment. That means there\u2019s something in the underlying physics of our universe that remains a mystery.\n\nThe Hubble tension is one of the most hotly debated discrepancies in all of astronomy. It centers around a number called the Hubble constant, which is functionally the rate at which our universe is expanding. Yup, our infinite universe is expanding. Trippy.\n\nWe\u2019ve known that this expansion is a fact of our cosmos for a while now (we also know that expansion is speeding up, but that\u2019s another story). But we still don\u2019t know exactly how fast this expansion is happening\u2014we don\u2019t know what the Hubble constant is. And it\u2019s not for lack of trying, either.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere\u2019s a few ways you can measure the Hubble Constant, but there are two major ones. The first, which is how the Hubble Telescope itself does it, is to figure out how fast the things around us are moving away from us. This is done by targeting specific, reliable objects in the sky, calculating the distances to them, and combining those distance with measurements of redshift (a phenomenon that happens when an object moves away from our vantage point, stretching out the light its sending our way and making it appear redder). This is called a local measurement, and it results in a Hubble constant of around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc).\n\nThe second way is to look at the Big Bang. Well, not directly\u2014that\u2019s currently impossible. But we can look at the cosmic microwave background, which is the radiation from the Big Bang that permeates every \u2018corner\u2019 of our universe. By studying this ancient radiation, we can get a reading of what the Hubble constant would have been back when the universe began, and then use our knowledge of the laws of physics to functionally fast-forward and find what that Hubble constant should be now. Using this method, we get a predicted Hubble constant of around 68 km/s/Mpc.\n\nAnd that is the Hubble tension\u2014those numbers should be the same, but they\u2019re not. And when expectation doesn\u2019t match observation in astronomy, it means one of two things: there\u2019s something wrong with our measurement techniques, or there\u2019s something wrong with our understanding of physics.\n\nNow, more and more, it\u2019s looking like the latter. A recent paper\u2014led by Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for his discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating and, by extension, his discovery of dark energy\u2014announced that observations from the James Webb Space Telescope further confirm Hubble\u2019s measurements of the local Hubble constant. According to our absolute best space telescope, the Hubble constant is around 73 km/s/Mpc (which is within the margin of error of the original Hubble measurement), not the ~68 km/s/Mpc it should be.\n\nIt might be fair to have a little bit of a \u201cso what?\u201d reaction to this news. After all, when you boil it down, the only thing we\u2019ve discovered is that there is in fact something we still don\u2019t understand about the expansion of the universe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the excitement behind this announcement comes from the fact that this new measurement confirms that the Hubble tension is real. It\u2019s not a quirk of an old telescope\u2014it\u2019s actually a problem. And that means this isn\u2019t some trivial squabble. There\u2019s something we don\u2019t know about the basic physics that underpin our entire cosmos.\n\nScientists are going to keep pushing to understand exactly what we\u2019re missing that is leading to this discrepancy. And if our scientific history is anything to go by, someday, they\u2019ll figure it out. And when they do, we\u2019re going to have entirely new physics on our hands. How exciting.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

Does that sound like an offer you\u2019ll check twice?\n\nThroughout the year, we asked researchers who appeared in our Science Uncovered series to name their unsung heroes of science. From musicians to machine learning experts, here are some of the inspired answers we received.\n\nDiabetes, polio and the value of open research\n\nTo kick off our list, we have cancer biotherapeutics researcher Denis Collins, who in spotlighting these particular scientists, not only admires their research but their commitment to making their discoveries freely available.\n\nFrederick Banting, James Collip, John McLeod and Charles Best discovered insulin and a method for purifying it, which led to the first treatment for type 1 diabetes, up until then a deadly disease, and saved millions of lives. \u201cWhile this triumph of medical science is in itself worthy of mention,\u201d Collins said, \u201cthe fact that the inventors chose not to profit from their discovery by selling their patents to the University of Toronto for $1 is a fascinating decision.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, virologist Jonas Salk, who discovered a vaccine for polio, a highly infectious disease that mostly affects young children, in the 1950s, \u201ccommitted to share the vaccine with multiple pharmaceutical companies for free\u201d, Collins explained. When asked in an interview who owned the patent for the vaccine, Salk replied: \u201cWell, the people, I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould (or should) such decisions be made today?\u201d Collins wonders.\n\nJane Grimson\n\nComputer scientist Declan O\u2019Sullivan sang the praises of Trinity College Dublin pro-chancellor Jane Grimson.\n\nGrimson, who was born in Scotland in 1949, was the first woman to graduate from engineering at Trinity when she obtained her degree in 1970. After completing an MSc at the University of Toronto and a PhD at the University of Edinburgh, she returned to Trinity to lecture in computer science, where she published widely in the fields of database systems and health informatics.\n\nDuring her career, she was the first woman dean of Trinity\u2019s engineering faculty and became the first women president of the Institution of Engineers of Ireland in 1999.\n\nShe also supported the recruitment and promotion of women in STEM throughout her career. In 2006, she helped set up Trinity\u2019s Centre for Women in Science and Engineering Research.\n\n\u201cHer pioneering work laid the foundational aspects of my research interests and continues to inspire the next generation of researchers,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said.\n\n\u201cIn a field predominantly occupied by men at the time, Prof Grimson not only broke down barriers but also paved the way for future generations of women in tech.\u201d\n\nDouglas Engelbart\n\nSoftware engineer Daniel Hickey is inspired by internet visionary Douglas Engelbart.\n\nBorn in the US in 1925, Engelbart decided in the early 1950s that he wanted to make the world a better place and believed computers would be the key to that mission. He studied and worked at University of California, Berkeley, before taking up a position at the Stanford Research Institute, where he was part of a team that pioneered computer interface elements including the mouse, hypertext and precursors to the graphical user interface.\n\n\u201cHis work laid the foundation for how we interact with computers today, but his contributions often go unrecognised,\u201d Hickey said.\n\n\u201cHis belief in technology as a tool to augment human capabilities resonates strongly with my own work in XR [extended reality], where the goal is to enhance learning and problem-solving through innovative tools.\u201d\n\nThey Might Be Giants\n\n\u201cMy unsung heroes of science are ironically very well sung in the sense that they are a rock band,\u201d said AI and data analytics researcher Tom\u00e1s Ward.\n\nWard has a soft spot for alternative rock band They Might Be Giants, which was formed in 1982 in New York by John Flansburgh and John Linnell. The band is known for humorous lyrics, experimental styles and unconventional instruments. Among the band\u2019s discography are five educational albums for children.\n\n\u201cBoth my children learned about solar physics and the solar system from the really catchy song \u2018Why does the sun shine?\u2019,\u201d Ward said.\n\nWard described the album \u2018Here Comes Science\u2019 as \u201ceducational and fun in an alternative rock format\u201d.\n\n\u201cCheck them out. If you ever watched the TV series \u2018Malcolm in the Middle\u2019 then you will instantly recognise them from the theme tune!\u201d\n\nHarrison Schmitt\n\nPhysicist Ciar\u00e1n Cooling looks up to American geologist Harrison Schmitt, who trained the Apollo astronauts in geological studies. Born in 1935, Schmitt is the only professional scientist who has walked on the moon and did so during the last Apollo mission, Apollo 17, in 1972.\n\n\u201cSchmitt\u2019s efforts to train astronauts in geology enabled them to carry out more specialised scientific inquiry and he himself recovered samples which have gone on to inform theories on the moon\u2019s core,\u201d Cooling said.\n\n\u201cSchmitt and his colleagues were vital in getting the most scientific value out of the Apollo missions and for answering so many questions about Earth\u2019s natural satellite.\u201d\n\nClaude Shannon\n\nCybersecurity researcher Kevin Curran admires the \u2018father of information theory\u2019 Claude Shannon for his \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d research, which laid the foundation for the digital age.\n\nBorn in the US in 1916, Shannon was a mathematician, electrical engineer, computer scientist and cryptographer.\n\nCurran described how Shannon\u2019s 1948 paper, \u2018A Mathematical Theory of Communication\u2019, \u201cintroduced the concept of using binary digits (bits) to represent information\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis concept became central to the fields of digital communication and information processing,\u201d Curran explained.\n\n\u201cHis theories helped to shape the development of modern digital networks, including the internet.\n\n\u201cBesides his seminal contributions to information theory, Shannon also made significant contributions to cryptography, particularly during his tenure at Bell Labs and his involvement in wartime codebreaking.\n\n\u201cShannon was also known for his playful and inventive personality, engaging in hobbies that ranged from juggling to unicycling, and he even built whimsical devices like a juggling robot and a chess-playing machine. He passed away in 2001, leaving behind a legacy that continues to influence technology and communication.\u201d\n\nJohn Vaughan Thompson\n\nMarine biologist Damien Haberlin is staying close to home with his pick, John Vaughan Thompson.\n\nBritish army surgeon Thompson, who was born in 1779 in New York, was also a marine biologist and made his most famous discoveries during his time in Cork, where he was posted in 1816.\n\nCharles Darwin is known to have taken one of Thompson\u2019s books with him on the famous second voyage of the Beagle.\n\nHaberlin explains Thompson\u2019s legacy: \u201cHe showed that what were thought to be different species were in fact different stages of the crab larvae, after metamorphosis.\n\n\u201cIt is possible he invented the plankton net in its modern form, and he was, categorically, the first person to use one to make systematic observations of zooplankton, all within Cork Harbour.\n\n\u201cThe simple plankton net remains the primary tool for countless scientist all over the world, who continue using it for systematic observations, just as Thomspon did over 200 years ago.\u201d\n\nBlindboy Boatclub\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take an unconventional approach and suggest a hero of science who might not immediately come to mind,\u201d said neuropsychologist April Hargreaves.\n\nChoosing Irish musician, author and podcaster Blindboy Boatclub, Hargreaves said he embodies a scientific mindset \u2013 \u201ccuriosity, truth-seeking and passion for understanding the world around us\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat makes him remarkable is not just his personal passion for learning, but his ability to ignite that same curiosity in others. Through his weekly podcast, he dives into a wide range of topics he\u2019s researched, delivering them in an informal and captivating way that makes listeners eager to explore further. His genuine fascination with these subjects is evident, and his approach reflects the curiosity and critical thinking that are at the core of scientific inquiry.\u201d\n\nStephanie Kwolek\n\nPolice officer turned tech founder Sheelagh Brady has great admiration for Stephanie Louise Kwolek, whose polymer research led to the invention of Kevlar, an ultra-strong and ultra-thick material best known for its use in bulletproof vests.\n\nBorn in 1923, Polish-American Kwolek completed a degree in chemistry at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1946. She had initially planned to become a doctor but found her chemistry research so interesting and challenging, she dropped her plans for medical school and made her career at DuPont. \u201cThis willingness to change, to follow what motivated her, makes her someone I admire,\u201d Brady said.\n\n\u201cMoreover, on a personal level I appreciate more than most, her invention.\u201d\n\nKwolek was inducted into the US National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1995 for her work. At the time she was only the fourth woman to have received the honour.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton\n\nStock market trader turned bioinformatician Barry Scott thinks \u2018the godfather of AI\u2019 Geoffrey Hinton, highly regarded in the field of AI, deserves wider recognition.\n\nBritish-Canadian Hinton, who was born in 1947, focused his research on deep learning and neural networks, and is credited with the idea of backpropagation \u2013 a way of training artificial neural networks to be more accurate by feeding error rates back through them, reducing the need for continued input from a human. His research paved the way for the rise of generative AI models such as ChatGPT.\n\nAlong with John Hopfield, Hinton was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics this year for contributions to AI and machine learning.\n\n\u201cWhile his acclaim within the AI community is significant,\u201d Scott said, \u201cI believe the full scope of his impact on the broader scientific field, especially as we stand on the cusp of AI\u2019s potential to revolutionise various scientific domains, is yet to be fully appreciated.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a wonderful life\n\nFinally, echoing the sentiments of the James Stewart Christmas classic, many researchers this year highlighted the supportive communities that make scientific enquiry possible.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s hear it for the teachers, they said. As physicist Sarah Guerin put it: \u201cTalk to any scientist and most will name at least one teacher who set them out on their research journey.\n\n\u201cInvestment in education, and investment in our teachers and their quality of life is an investment in scientific progress.\u201d\n\nBiophotonics researcher Sanathana Konugolu Venkata Sekar is of a similar view. \u201cI feel immense gratitude and consider myself truly blessed to have had such inspirational teachers and supervisors.\u201d\n\nBrain tumour researcher Lily Keane hailed mentor and neurologist Prof Michelle Monje from Stanford University as \u201ca true inspiration for women in science\u201d, who, despite an immense workload, always finds time to support other researchers in her field.\n\nMolecular biologist Jennifer Drohan named a particular schoolteacher who inspired her research \u2013 her science teacher Mrs Power. \u201cI was lucky enough to be taught by her in her last year at the school before she retired \u2013 she was a brilliant teacher who made the subject come alive and \u2013 quite possibly \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today if it wasn\u2019t for her.\u201d\n\nAnd cancer researcher Tr\u00edona N\u00ed Chonghaile also expressed gratitude for a particular teacher \u2013 her mum. \u201cShe was a passionate biology teacher and inspired me and lots of others by explaining how the body worked.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, software engineer Jacek D\u0105browski said that PhD students and postdocs often do the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d of the research process, which can go unnoticed. \u201cWithout their dedication, many scientific advances would not be possible.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, epilepsy researcher Mark Cunningham said that the technical support staff who are \u201csometimes invisible\u201d are invaluable to the research process. \u201cI have been very lucky in my career to be supported by excellent science technicians who have assisted with a variety of research and teaching activities.\u201d\n\nExtending this gratitude to the wider community, then, electronics engineer Lizy Abraham said: \u201cThroughout my life, numerous unsung heroes have played pivotal roles in shaping my journey and fostering my passion for science. These heroes come from various facets of my experiences and interactions, each contributing in their own way to my development as a researcher and thinker.\u201d\n\nAnd with a final word on community from explainable AI researcher Alison O\u2019Connor, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s all the people that have mentored and supported me over the years. From lecturers in undergraduate to my parents and sisters.\n\n\u201cThese people facilitate my ability to do science and helping someone else achieve their dream \u2026 well that\u2019s pretty heroic in my opinion.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the knowledge you need to succeed.

            "article_content": "(\u00a9 JM_Image_Factory - Canva.com)\n\nESG (environmental, social, and governance) was a popular corporate initiative not too long ago, but recently a number of high-profile ESG failures have captured attention and soured investors. Financial Times reports that in 2024, investors have pulled $40 billion from ESG equity funds, which marks the first year that number has been negative. At BlackRock investment firm, once considered a leader in ESG, investments in its largest ESG fund were cut in half in only three years, from $25 billion in 2021 to $12.8 billion last May.\n\nWhy is this happening? Part can be attributed to the anti-ESG movement being spearheaded by conservative lawmakers in the United States. But there's more going on here. For years, companies have struggled to measure the results of ESG initiatives. It can be challenging to quantify something nebulous, like employee morale, and some results won't present themselves until a few years later, sometimes under an entirely different umbrella. Other companies have presented sustainability goals that are aggressive to the point of unrealistic \u2014 a byproduct of \"green washing\" tactics that have become more prevalent as ESG started to pay dividends with customer loyalty and trust.\n\nWhat companies need to realize is that many of their existing processes, innocuous as they may be, could be detracting ESG practices, diminishing their effectiveness. Efforts to course correct must pay particular attention to the \"G\" of ESG, governance, or companies risk watching ESG initiatives flop.\n\nPublic greenwashing\n\nThere exists a craving for media coverage of companies making big, bold promises about their commitment to ESG and a voracious appetite for companies pulling them back. In 2022, BP shared two announcements that betray its true intentions: the company had enjoyed a record-breaking $28 billion profit in 2022, and recanted its pledge to cut fossil fuel output and greenhouse emissions by 2030. Similarly, in 2021, Shell received a lot of buzz when they committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, but the company retracted that date entirely only a few months ago.\n\nOther examples abound, and it's not too hard to reason why companies might write an ESG check they can't cash. Not only does ESG garner support from customers, but its campaigns claim to pay dividends so far into the future that they may as well be abstractions. This sort of \"greenwashing\" affords companies many of the benefits of ESG without requiring any actual effort\u2014few outside incentives exist to encourage companies to keep their word.\n\nStill, despite hesitations and pushback, there exists plenty of data to support the claim that ESG initiatives are good for business in general. Customer sentiment around ESG initiatives is unambiguous, and companies pay a price for neglecting them. According to PwC, 83% of customers believe companies need to create ESG best practices, and 76% would stop purchasing from a company that neglected ESG entirely.\n\nMeasurable, realistic, and incremental goals\n\nPerhaps there's nothing nefarious going on, and the BPs and Shells of the world used honest assessments to arrive at their original goals. It remains true that ESG initiatives are difficult to measure, increasing the likelihood that a company will be able to achieve them through steady progress over a long period of time. This is partially because, often, results are so far divorced from the associated processes and changes that it becomes difficult to make adjustments along the way, lest a company find itself entirely off-base.\n\nOften, these initiatives abide by a series of unrelated or abstracted KPIs that aren't tethered to a single decision. Take, for example, an organization attempting to reducing its environmental impact by holding conferences and meetings closer to its headquarters, removing the need for airplane travel, and only partnering with vendors who are similarly committed to ESG. In the short term, this has the chance to increase costs (working with a new vendor, event relocation, etc.) or turn away customers who may no longer be able to attend in-person, and focusing on these year-over-year changes might create the false impression that ESG is simply a sunk cost. What's harder to measure is how many customers will opt for this company over a competitor because of its ESG stance or the increase in employee morale from working an event requiring fewer travel logistics.\n\nOne way out of this conundrum is for folks to take matters into their own hands and establish measuring methods specific to the company. Perhaps something like \"percentage of recycling versus trash\" is less relevant in an industry plagued by high turnover rates that require constant and costly employee training, whereas highlighting the sustainability of upscaling efforts makes more sense. This mindfulness enables shareholders and internal stakeholders to develop an unambiguous grasp of how ESG's many tendrils are reaching across an organization without having to connect the dots themselves.\n\nA 2023 report by KPMG highlights some visibility tactics to pursue: In one case study, a \"large global asset manager\" was struggling to measure the impact of its ESG efforts and communicate the results to all relevant stakeholders. Rather than home in on one or two KPIs or lean on industry best practices, the company developed an app to act as a central repository for data and to perform calculations determining ESG impact. This enabled the company to start identifying points of synergy and crossover\u2014how a handful of disparate metrics were telling a larger ESG story\u2014and communicate these findings via seamless app integration. This particular app was built on a no-code platform, unlocking effortless adaptations as circumstances changed.\n\nThese sorts of efforts lay the governance foundation for a feedback loop that allows all stakeholders to weigh in along the way, affording them true agency over how an organization is run and establishing accountability. Additionally, companies now have actual, non-greenwashed results they can point to as a competitive differentiator and as proof that ESG is an ongoing priority even in the minutia. These may not be the sorts of things that catch global headlines, but the small, pointed actions taken in the name of ESG stick around.\n\nGovernance by generative AI\n\nAlmost as quickly as generative AI was hailed as an industry savior, it became condemned as an environmental disaster, requiring as much energy as a small country. It's gotten to the point where Amazon has invested in nuclear power upon which to run its AI, and other companies are following suit.\n\nCompanies focused on ESG might think they're side-stepping any responsibility by relegating AI to only mission-critical tasks or preventing its use altogether within a company's tech stack.\n\nIt's not that simple. Too often, companies don't realize just how big a part AI plays in background activities that are imperceptible to most of its employees. Sure, things like data analysis unambiguously require plenty of resources, but so do more innocuous products like grammar software, payroll consolidation, and note-taking apps, especially when connected to a unified system. Use is growing, as well. According to a survey by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, weekly corporate AI use rose from 37% in 2023 to 72% in 2024.\n\nDeployed and configured strategically, AI can facilitate greener operations \u2014 by conducting system-wide audits of real-time data, offering predictions of how ESG impact will be felt, and providing tailored findings to anyone within an organization. The technology also helps identify which data points are to be monitored and prioritized, reducing the chance of human bias and ensuring a level of governance guided by facts over feelings.\n\nGSE replacing ESG\n\nESG plans fail when companies forget that the acronym contains three letters, not just the first two; essential to G is holding oneself accountable in achieving E and S initiatives. Customers and shareholders want to see that accountability in action, as well, through measurable results that actually make a lasting impact and a roadmap to enacting real change \u2014 and it's here where governance takes center stage. Companies need to demonstrate leadership and management of initiatives, like sustainability measures, and making sure goals and deadlines are met so others can help govern your efforts based on your own idea of success. Even governance requires governance."

            "article_content": "Elon Musk\u2019s escalating legal feud with Sam Altman could act as a drag on OpenAI\u2019s rocket-like ascent to the top of the artificial intelligence world.\n\nThe two one-time collaborators are now locked in a simultaneous battle to advance AI and prevail in a courtroom fight over the future of OpenAI, the organization Musk and Altman founded together in 2015 before parting ways.\n\nMusk, who now is running a competing AI company called xAI, is trying to convince a federal judge to issue an injunction that would stop the creator of chatbot ChatGPT from converting to a for-profit company.\n\nThe lawsuit Musk filed in August also accuses OpenAI of putting profits before its initial nonprofit mission of advancing AI in a way that benefits all of humanity.\n\nTesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk listens as US President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with House Republicans in Washington, DC, on Nov. 13. ALLISON ROBBERT/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n\"I think the fact that Musk has asked for a preliminary injunction ups the ante,\" Rob Rosenberg, former general counsel for Showtime Networks and founder of Telluride Legal Strategies, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"Because if he were successful it would definitely throw a major wrench into the current plans for OpenAI.\"\n\nAltman, OpenAI and its biggest backer Microsoft, which is also named as a defendant in the case, last week shot back at Musk's request for the judge to step in on an emergency basis, calling his allegations \"false\" and claiming he has no legal basis for blocking OpenAI\u2019s for profit conversion.\n\nDividing up the spoils\n\nThe legal fight is unfolding while OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) discuss how to divide up the spoils of the artificial intelligence upstart when and if OpenAI becomes a for-profit company.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft hired Wall Street investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to advise them on these discussions after OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion funding round valuing it at $157 billion. Microsoft thus far has invested $14 billion since 2019.\n\nAltman has said OpenAI needs to become a for-profit to help it attract additional investment capital. In September, the charity projected a $5 billion loss for 2024.\n\nSam Altman, co-founder and CEO. of OpenAI, speaks during the New York Times annual DealBook summit on Dec. 4, in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nMusk's suit could introduce perilous delays. According to the New York Times, the terms of the charity's latest investment round require it to shed its non-profit status within two years, or have those investments convert to debt.\n\nMusk is not the only rival that could slow things down for OpenAI. AI competitor Meta (META) on Thursday sent a letter to California's Attorney General Rob Bonta asking the state to block OpenAI from becoming a for-profit business.\n\nIt said that allowing the change would set a dangerous precedent, with non-profit donors simultaneously benefiting from government-allowed tax deductions and profits from traditional investments.\n\nHow things unraveled\n\nTo understand the current feud between Musk and Altman it helps to know the origins of their onetime partnership and how things unraveled.\n\nThe two men started OpenAI in 2015 as a nonprofit under the name OpenAI Inc., a nod to its mission of safely and transparently developing AI to advance humanity instead of pursuing profits.\n\nMusk left in 2018. There are now disagreements in court about the reasons for that departure and what led up to it.\n\nMusk has alleged that Altman \"deceived\" him into co-founding and funding OpenAI by promising that it would remain a non-profit, then took steps to unlawfully enrich himself by partnering OpenAI with companies in which he held financial interest, including Reddit (RDDT) and Stripe.\n\nElon Musk and Sam Altman speaking in 2015, the year they co-founded OpenAI.

Other claims include breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duties, unlawful self-dealing, and unfair business practices.\n\nThe contracts, Musk said, threaten fair competition in the market for AI products, specifically, by requiring investors not to fund the companies' mutual competitors, including xAI.\n\n\"Plaintiffs, consumers, investors, and the generative AI market will suffer irreparable harm if defendants\u2019 conduct continues unabated,\" Musk said in his request for an injunction.\n\n\"The development of generative AI technology presents profound implications for society, making preservation of competitive markets in this sector uniquely important to the public interest.\"\n\nMicrosoft has rejected those claims.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella stands between logos for OpenAI and Microsoft during the OpenAI DevDay event on Nov 6, 2023 in San Francisco. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\n\"Microsoft never agreed to avoid funding OpenAI\u2019s competitors or agreed that other investors would do so \u2014 full stop,\" the company said in a court document. \"Not as part of the latest round of OpenAI funding, nor at any other time.\"\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times earlier this month, Altman said had he known OpenAI would need so much capital he would have founded it using a different business structure.\n\nMr. Altman said he was \"tremendously sad\" about his legal dispute with Musk, saying that \"I grew up with Elon as like a mega hero.\"\n\nHe said he was not concerned that Musk could use his close ties with President-elect Donald Trump to make things more difficult for OpenAI once the new administration takes power.\n\n\"I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power to the degree that Elon would hurt competitors and advantage his own businesses,\" he said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

            "article_content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is in free fall, with shares tanking 12% in premarket trading on Monday. This comes hot on the heels of Friday's announcement that it's getting booted from the Nasdaq-100 Index, effective December 23. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Axon Enterprise (AXON are stepping in, replacing Super Micro, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). For Super Micro, the move caps a brutal nine months that saw its stock lose nearly 70% of its value since hitting a record $118.8 in March. The company's troubles have snowballed, from missed earnings expectations to a delayed annual report filing, auditor resignations, and a Department of Justice probe triggered by short-seller allegations.\n\nBut the hits keep coming. Bloomberg dropped another bombshell, reporting that Super Micro has hired Evercore to explore capital-raising options, including equity sales, debt financing, or private equity investments. This isn't the company's first trip down the capital-raising laneback in March, it sold 2 million new shares to drum up $2 billion. Now, with governance concerns lingering and a February deadline to file overdue reports to avoid Nasdaq delisting, Super Micro is walking a tightrope. Meanwhile, its pivot to BDO as its new auditor underscores a desperate attempt to restore credibility, but investors are clearly skeptical.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Super Micro is teetering on the edge. The Nasdaq removal is a glaring red flag, and while the potential capital raise could buy some breathing room, the company's underlying issuesgovernance gaps, financial reporting delays, and a shrinking market caparen't going away anytime soon. For investors, this might be a wait-and-watch game, but with every misstep, the odds of a turnaround get slimmer. The question now is whether Super Micro can stabilize or if it's destined to be a cautionary tale for growth stocks gone wrong.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n"

Since kickstarting my career, I\u2019ve spent over two decades in the market navigating the technology landscape, focusing on risk mitigation through the dot com bubble, credit default of \u201808, and, more recently, with the AI boom. In one word, what I\u2019d like my service to revolve around is momentum. I channel years of experience at top-ranked institutional sell-side and buy-side firms and first-hand experience in retail, biotech, and technology sectors to provide data-driven insights to capture momentum. I deep dive into market trends, scrutinize company fundamentals, and assess the disruptive potential of emerging technologies and growth opportunities. My service aims to act as a tool to maneuver the market landscape so that you can know when momentum begins and, equally important, when it\u2019ll end. My investment strategy is simple. I specialize in tech sector investments, emphasizing risk management. I diversify within the sector, focusing on companies with solid fundamentals and innovative products; while I focus on European and U.S. stocks, I also informally cover Asia-based names that I believe have reasonable risk-reward profiles. My equity-focused approach aims to optimize returns in the tech landscape. I\u2019ve built my wealth by navigating the technology landscape and am looking to extend my knowledge of the industry to help advance the retail guys' investment journey. I firmly believe that technology's exponential growth has reached a disruptive peak, with consumer demand for innovation soaring. This convergence presents a prime window of investment opportunity. The retail investor is becoming more curious and conscious of these developments, and I\u2019d like to add to the knowledge in the field, helping guide their investments. As a contributor on Seeking Alpha, my motivation is to share my insights, research, and investment ideas with a wider audience of like-minded individuals.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s Disclosure: I/we have no stock, option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned, and no plans to initiate any such positions within the next 72 hours.

AI search is evolving quickly. It is important to watch how people adopt AI search because it may alter the way people discover you, your brand, or your website. We\u2019re watching it happen, month after month, right now. And with ChatGPT search now available to all free users, this growth could further accelerate.\n\nChatGPT vs. Perplexity. ChatGPT is now 6x larger than Perplexity, according to an LLM referral analysis of November traffic by BrightEdge. Also, search traffic from ChatGPT (up 44%) and Perplexity (up 71%) continues to grow month over month.\n\nBut. Google is still far and away the leader, with 92.4% of referral traffic coming from Google. Meanwhile, Microsoft Bing\u2019s market share was 4.2% in November.\n\nWait\u2026 Maybe you heard that Rand Fishkin, CEO and co-founder of SparkToro, last month estimated ChatGPT\u2019s search market share was 4.33%, based on data from SimilarWeb and Datos (a Semrush company)? How is there such a big difference and confusion over the market share numbers?\n\nWell, this BrightEdge analysis is based on referral data. Also, Fishkin later downplayed the 4% figure during his BrightonSEO keynote, because not every prompt/chat is a \u201csearch.\u201d\n\nSo if you heard that ChatGPT\u2019s search market share is 4%, you can safely call that stat wrong and disregard it."

            "article_content": "War, disorder and regime change rattle the Middle East. Russia and Iran, two of the world\u2019s major disrupters, suffer humiliating setbacks. China, despite a troubled economy, presses its expanding ambitions in much of the developing world. And now the German government collapses. This is the sort of confluence of world events that historians will later look back on and wonder why people at the time failed to recognize an elemental pivot point.\n\nAll this as the West\u2019s U.S. anchor seems incapable of \u2014 or not interested in \u2014 holding the ship of state steady.\n\nTuesday\u2019s fall of the Berlin governing coalition led by Social Democrat Olaf Scholz is in some ways strictly about Germany. Watching German TV coverage of the momentous vote in the Bundestag to dump this government and call new elections, I was struck by how the news was perceived by Germans as confirmation of two American political adages: \u201cAll politics is local,\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d If you took the German coverage as your guide, this collapse is mainly about threats to trim pension and welfare benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut behind the threat is a classic and abiding German anxiety: a fear that the country\u2019s enviable stability is no longer dependable. And that takes us straight to the bigger picture, which is not at all parochial.\n\nSince World War II, the U.S. role in Europe has been to provide security \u2014 against Russia, but also within Europe. Ukraine aside, this is the longest period of peace among European nations in centuries, and while surely the European Union is a key reason for that, it\u2019s the assurance of U.S. support and defense through the Atlantic alliance that provides the foundation.\n\nNow that foundation is looking pretty dang shaky. Although the Republican Party seems hopelessly tangled up between its long-standing internationalism and its ascendant Trumpian America-First-ism, the president-elect is threatening to act on his decades-old annoyance with NATO and the Europeans whom he views as leeches and layabouts. This is not a recipe for effective U.S. leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo country has believed more in the European experiment, and in the value and goodness of U.S. leadership, than Germany. It\u2019s a near-miracle of history that West Germany\u2019s enduring postwar democracy was in part inspired, imposed and sustained by exactly the country that had just reduced much of Germany to rubble.\n\nIn every decade since the war, rumblings of right-wing extremism have greeted each dip in the country\u2019s economic or political fortunes. Yet Germans, both before and after the reunification of East and West that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, have consistently put their trust and effort into a philosophy of Stability \u00dcber Alles.\n\nNow, the far right is surging once more, in the form of an anti-immigrant political party, the Alternative for Germany, which is gaining votes even as the government\u2019s domestic security agency keeps tabs on the threat it poses to the country\u2019s constitution and democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat surge is happening at the same time that the two major parties, the conservative Christian Democrats and the leftist Social Democrats, have \u2014 much like our own Republicans and Democrats \u2014 lost their clear visions for the future and, as a result, seen a muddling of their traditional followers.\n\nIn a European parliamentary system, when such consensus fails, disorder can follow quickly compared with the U.S. federal system. Our no-confidence votes arrive over years rather than mere weeks or months. Other parliamentary systems, in France and Britain, are struggling along with Germany\u2019s to assure a stable confidence in government.\n\nBut the U.S. election was a clear thumbs-down to the status quo, and contributes to the disquiet of the West. Without a reasonably united Europe, U.S. capacity to resist China\u2019s power grabs or restrain Vladimir Putin\u2019s fantasies of restoring empire will be severely cramped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith luck, the Germans will stumble into a new governing coalition after an election campaign over the next two months, but there\u2019s little reason to believe that the election will produce a clear notion of where the country is heading. For Germans, as for Americans, the issues that divide and frighten people are just too big, the risks too scary, the forces of change seemingly impossible to regulate in any effective way.\n\nGermans, as former chancellor Angela Merkel discovered in her last years in office, are indeed eager to present themselves to the world as a force for peace and equality, but they are not willing to risk economic security to take in the world\u2019s refugees to a degree that would change the basic character of their country. And while committed to Ukrainian sovereignty \u2014 Germans have put up the money and military hardware to prove it \u2014 they are not willing to poke the Russian bear to the point of risking their own security. Their shaky confidence is further rattled by the possibility of global tariff wars that threaten to strike their export-dependent economy especially hard."

            "article_content": "Nvidia\u2019s next-gen series of GPUs is an open secret, and just a month out from CES 2025, the names and specs for these potentially massive graphics cards are out in the open. In the latest leak, a graphics OEM spoiled the names of the top five Nvidia cards, including the monstrous RTX 5090. The top-end card in the codenamed Blackwell series could take up a ton of space inside your PC. At the same time, it demands enough juice to make your next itemized electrical bill as big as the card itself.\n\nCard manufacturer Zotac leaked the SKUs for Nvidia\u2019s next slate of cards. VideoCardz picked up on the Google Search listings CSI tools before Zotac could pull the results. The screenshotted listings mention the 5090 with 32GB of GDDR7 memory at the top end, which confirms an 8GB increase from the RTX 4090\u2019s 24 GB.\n\nThese cards are big suckers. The RTX 5090 will supposedly take up three to four slots on your motherboard. The current RTX 4090 takes up three slots on most boards. That doesn\u2019t account for length, however. Nvidia\u2019s cards are also a massive power hog. The card manufacturer recommends having a PSU between 650W and 750W. Past rumors hinted the card itself could have a 600W TGP. Rumormonger Kotike7kimi, who normally has a good track record for GPU leaks, wrote on Twitter that the card may demand slightly less than the total 600W. Either way, the 5080 is somewhat more manageable, supposedly demanding 400W. The current RTX 4090 has a 450W total graphics power.\n\nThe Zotac leak showed five cards, including the GeForce RTX 5090, the RTX 5090D (a model made for Chinese markets), the RTX 5080, the RTX 5070 Ti, and the RTX 5070. If you\u2019re wondering where the 5060 or 5050 are, it\u2019s safe to assume they may not arrive at the same time as these higher-end cards. It\u2019s another matter whether Nvidia announces them at CES 2025 but later releases them.\n\nBeyond the need for a separate baby carriage inside your PC case to keep it cradled without toppling your tower, the confirmed VRAM gives more credence to past rumors that the 5090 will have 21,760 FP32 CUDA cores, more than double the number of the RTX 4090.\n\nWe\u2019d also like to hear from Nvidia itself why it decided to release the 5070 Ti \u201cTitanium\u201d edition simultaneously with its other cards. Nvidia normally drops these versions later as a sidegrade to existing GPUs, as with the 4070 Ti. Nvidia seems to be focusing on the high-end GPUs, while leaving the lower-end cards for later.\n\nFor the budget builders, it doesn\u2019t leave much room to hope the lower-end 50-series will be inexpensive. There\u2019s been much less to go on with the 5060 or supposed 5060 Ti. There have been even fewer hints about any kind of RTX 5050. Intel just released its budget cards like the B580, with claims it can top the RTX 4060 in most games, plus it comes with 12GB of VRAM. So far, rumors hint the non-Ti 5060 may have 8GB."

            "article_content": "TCS\u2019 2025 Cybersecurity Outlook finds that organizations that prepare for evolving cyber threats can build the necessary resilience to operate in an increasingly complex threat landscape\n\nDUBAI: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) (BSE: 532540, NSE: TCS), a global leader in IT services, consulting, and business solutions, has announced its 2025 Cybersecurity Outlook, a list of technology trends and focus areas curated by TCS experts. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), cloud security and supply chain resilience will be key for organizations to effectively navigate the threat landscape in the coming year.\n\nAs next-gen technologies continue to gain momentum across industries, they give rise to new and complex threats. Experts and leaders at TCS have identified seven focus areas that will influence cybersecurity and help organizations prioritize their security investments to prepare for increasing cyberattacks.\n\nGanesa Subramanian Vaikuntam, Global Head of Cybersecurity at TCS, said, \u201cWith geopolitical shifts and evolving technology, global cybersecurity is undergoing a major transformation. GenAI is enhancing operational efficiencies, but organizations must equip themselves to counteract cyber threats. It is imperative for organizations to harness these advancements and implement GenAI-powered threat detection and response systems to stay ahead of the curve. In this era of evolving technologies, a robust and proactive cyber resilience strategy is not just an option, but a necessity for enterprises to effectively navigate and mitigate unforeseen cyber incidents.\u201d\n\nIn the face of emerging cyberthreats, enterprises are looking for ways to leverage GenAI to secure their businesses, according to TCS\u2019 2025 Cybersecurity Outlook. The cybersecurity trends to look out for in 2025 are:\n\nInfluence of GenAI in cybersecurity on the rise\n\nGenAI is transforming organizational operations but is also being exploited by cybercriminals for advanced attacks like deepfakes, phishing, data manipulation, and new malware. In response, organizations must fight fire with fire by deploying GenAI-powered threat detection and response systems.\n\nCloud security remains crucial\n\nAs cloud computing adoption continues to accelerate, organizations need to implement strong security protocols like encryption, access controls, and continuous monitoring. Maintaining proper cloud configurations is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and breaches, and those moving to multi-cloud or hybrid environments will need to adapt their security measures accordingly.\n\nElastic supply chains will be relevant for operational integrity\n\nIn 2025, organizations will need flexible, resilient supply chains due to changing geopolitics and partner ecosystems. Leaders must develop proactive strategies to adjust their supply networks, while protecting sensitive data and maintaining regulatory compliance. Enhancing supply chain resilience will be increasingly vital for preserving operational integrity in the face of uncertainty.\n\nEmerging business models will underscore the need to be secure by design\n\nAt a time when digital technologies, IoT capabilities, and advanced connectivity are driving new business models in EV charging, DERMS, autonomous vehicles, and other connected factories, organizations must secure their value chains to ensure these businesses are safe by design. By 2025, the growth of IoT devices will require stronger device hardening, secure communication channels, and ongoing vulnerability assessments to maintain momentum in business growth.\n\nCybersecurity Mesh Architecture will pave the way for Zero Trust security\n\nOrganizations are moving from traditional security models to zero-trust architecture, which requires continuous authentication and limited access to minimize threats. By 2026, most large enterprises will adopt zero-trust methods, consolidating security tools to be more efficient. In order to adapt, organizations must use integrated platforms for orchestrating and automating cybersecurity while working towards Cybersecurity Mesh Architecture (CSMA) for dynamic, collaborative, and secure environments.\n\nCSOs will adopt an \u2018automation-first\u2019 approach to Managed Detection and Response\n\nModern Managed Detection and Response (MDR) combines Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Operation Centers (SOCs), Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR), Extended Detection and Response (XDR), threat hunting, threat intelligence, and various attack simulations. These components must integrate seamlessly under an \u201cautomation-first\u201d approach for strong cyber defense against new technologies like Gen AI, quantum computing, and 5G expansion. By 2025, organizations are likely to seek more industry-specific and integrated cyber-physical security solutions.\n\nBack to basics: Cyber resilience will be essential for business security\n\nNow more than ever, a robust cyber resilience strategy is crucial for organizations to handle unexpected cyber incidents and will require taking a fresh look at the basics: regular backups, detailed incident response plans, and business continuity measures. Something as simple as regular drills can enhance organizational preparedness and response capabilities. Promoting a culture of resilience will help minimize downtime and disruptions from cyberattacks.\n\nA leader in cybersecurity globally, TCS\u2019 offerings range from consulting, implementation, to managed security services across \u2013 detection and response, identity and access management, attack surface management, governance, risk and compliance, data privacy and protection, digital forensics and incident response, cloud security, and cyber physical security.

The wise men brought gold, cadbury creme, and myrrh.'\n\nOthers appeared triggered by the early arrival of Easter chocolate, with one person writing: 'Utter woke nonsense.'\n\nLiberty Lester, from Jersey, spotted an aisle full of seasonal chocolate after visiting her local Alliance supermarket on December 16\n\nAnother commented: 'Our shop got them yesterday....'\n\nA third quizzed, 'Did we sleep through Christmas?' while a fourth raged: 'Ridiculous!!!'\n\nMeanwhile, a number of Brits voiced support over the idea of Easter chocolate being available to buy year-round.\n\nOne person wrote, 'Hey man I get your point, but I\u2019ll take a mini egg any day,' while another said, 'Chocolate is chocolate and mini eggs slap so I don't even care.'\n\nA third wrote: 'Y'all wouldn\u2019t judge if I got the kilo bag of mini eggs for Christmas, perks of my dad working retail.'\n\nFinally, another commented: 'Creme egg and mini eggs should be available all year round!'\n\nIt comes as Cadbury has revealed it has axed a popular treat from its festive range, leaving fans resorting to drastic measures as they claim Christmas is 'ruined.'\n\nThe chocolate confectioner is facing backlash after confirming Festive Friends will not be returning to supermarket shelves in the run-up to Christmas.\n\nThe post has since sparked a debate among Brits on social media, as people argue as to whether Easter chocolate should be available to buy throughout the year\n\nSimilar to Cadbury's beloved Animals biscuits, Festive Friends are bite sized biscuits half covered in milk chocolate and shaped in a variety of traditional Christmas characters, such as Santa, snowmen and reindeer.\n\nCadbury fans have been looking forward to stocking up on the seasonal treat ahead of the festive season, but were left scratching their heads after failing to spot the beloved biscuits in shops across the UK.\n\nFans took to social media in September to search for answers, but have since been left 'heartbroken' after the chocolate giant confirmed their decision to discontinue the product.\n\nOne dedicated fan wrote, 'Have Cadbury's stopped selling Festive Friends? Because I haven't seen any anywhere and I'm disappointed,' to which another responded, 'You and me both!!!'\n\nIn response, a Cadbury spokesperson wrote: 'Hi there, we can confirm that Festive Friends are being replaced by Festive Animals this Christmas."

            "article_content": "Although we are all well aware of who Jeff Bezos is, and that he's worth a few quid, not a lot of us are clued up on his family life.\n\nHis surname might have become synonymous with astronomical wealth, but it turns out that he only acquired it when he was four years old.\n\nAnd that's why his biological father, Ted Jorgensen, had no idea that his son had become one of the richest blokes in the world until 2012.\n\nAdvert\n\nTake a look at this:\n\nJorgensen was 69 years old when he opened up about discovering that he was the father of Bezos two years earlier, who at that time was in his late 40s.\n\nThe e-commerce kingpin was born in January 1964 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, while his mother Jacklyn Gise was still in high school and his dad was working as a circus performer.\n\nAdvert\n\nBut the pair divorced the following year, when the Amazon founder - then named Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen - was just 17 months old.\n\nGise went on to marry Miguel 'Mike' Bezos in April 1968, while asking Jorgensen to let her new husband adopt their son and give up custody.\n\nHe agreed, and the little boy who would later become a business magnate had his surname legally changed to Bezos.\n\nSpeaking to Inside Edition in 2014, Jorgensen recalled the last time he had ever seen his son before they completely lost contact.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"I was working in a Walmart and I remember them coming to visit me for some reason,\" he said.\n\n\"It was cold and he had his little winter coat on, and I just remember him walking down the aisle coming to see me.\"\n\nJeff Bezos pictured with Jacklyn and Miguel in 2016 (MOLLY RILEY/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFast forward to 2012, Jorgensen was left stunned when journalist Brad Stone waltzed into his bike shop in Arizona, US, to ask him a few questions.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe informed the shop owner that he had made the connection between him and Bezos while conducting research for a book detailing Amazon's rise to power.\n\nThis came as quite the shock to the former unicyclist, as he had never even heard of the world's largest online retailer and didn't use a computer.\n\nHe told Stone at the time: \"I didn't know where he [Bezos] was, if he had a good job or not, or if he was alive or dead.\"\n\nJorgensen said that over the years, he had forgotten the new surname his son had taken, hence why he had no idea about Bezos' meteoric journey to success.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe opened up about regretting not having a relationship with his son during the 2014 interview, saying he regarded it as a 'big mistake'.\n\n\"But at the time, I thought it was the best,\" Jorgensen said.\n\nReflecting on his conversation with Stone, he said: \"He asked me if I knew who Jeff Bezos was. I said, 'No, the name kind of sounds familiar, but I don't know him'.\"\n\nTed Jorgensen passed away in 2015 (YouTube/Inside Edition)\n\nJorgensen - who was battling emphysema at the time - spoke of his desire to apologise to his son for what he regarded as the biggest mistake of his life, although getting in touch with a bloke as high-profile as Bezos proved difficult.\n\n\"I would just like to tell him I used to change his diapers and just shake his hand and tell him he's really done a good job with his life,\" he said.\n\nThe bike shop owner, who was based in Phoenix, passed away in March 2015, aged 70.\n\nAccording to Page Six, he never reconnected with Bezos before he died.\n\nWhen asked about Jorgensen in 1999, the billionaire told Wired: \"The reality, as far as I'm concerned, is that my dad [Miguel Bezos] is my natural father.\n\n\"The only time I ever think about it, genuinely, is when a doctor asks me to fill out a form.\"\n\nHe previously praised his adoptive dad for moving to the US from Cuba as a teenager, saying: \"His grit, determination, and optimism are inspiring.\"\n\nBezos - who created Amazon out of his garage in Seattle in 1994 - stepped down as CEO of the company in July 2021.\n\nAccording to Forbes, his current net worth is a whopping $241.2billion."

            "article_content": "For the last month, New Jerseyans have reported odd lights in the sky at night, a rash of reported drone sightings that has attracted the attention of local residents, politicians and even President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nConcerned witnesses have described clusters of lights, saying they look like drones hovering over populated areas around the state. Now, even as sightings have expanded to New York and Maryland, government officials haven\u2019t been able to put people\u2019s minds at ease.\n\nSo who (or what) is behind the mysterious drone sightings? And can you shoot them down in California?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'This has gone too far': Drones temporarily closed runways at NY airport, governor says\n\nBecause the sightings aren't confirmed to be connected, it's possible different sightings have different explanations.\n\nFederal authorities have tried to reassure residents that the objects don\u2019t appear to be operating nefariously. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have said such sightings mostly appear to be not drones at all.\n\n\u201cHistorically, we have experienced cases of mistaken identity, where reported drones are, in fact, manned aircraft or facilities,\u201d the agencies said in a joint statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey lawmakers say they believe there is more to the story than federal officials have shared publicly.\n\nCan you shoot down drones in California? What to know after mystery NJ sightings\n\nAnd President-elect Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to demand government give answers, writing: \"Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\" On Nov. 22, the FAA issued a temporary flight restriction prohibiting drones over Trump's National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey.\n\nOn Thursday Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., criticized the Biden administration for being \"dismissive\" about the reported sightings arguing the White House team has failed his \"obligation to the American people to figure out and tell us what is going on immediately.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lack of clear answers has fueled rampant speculation and sometimes bizarre or joking theories.\n\n\u201cThe drones in New Jersey can easily be explained. Teams are clearly spying on the Jets and Giants practices which is why they have struggled this season,\u201d former NFL kicker Lawrence Tynes said in a post on X.\n\n\u201cFirst, a Chinese spy balloon drifted across U.S. airspace for a week. Now, unidentified drones are flying over New Jersey, avoiding radar detection. Gaps in our airspace are being exploited, and because of it, the safety of Americans is at risk,\u201d New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew posted.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some possible explanations for the sightings \u2013 and the evidence for or against the theories.\n\nFor the last month, New Jerseyans have reported odd lights in the sky at night, a rash of reported drone sightings that has attracted the attention of local residents. These photos were taken on Dec. 8 in Toms River, N.J.\n\nIs it really drones?\n\nGovernment officials have said it\u2019s likely there\u2019s aren\u2019t actually drones in many of the sightings. White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said many of the sightings are actually of piloted aircraft flying legally.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry Direen, an electronic and software engineering expert at DireenTech, said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if people were seeing drones at first, but that once the notion of drones took hold, people assumed any aircraft they couldn\u2019t identify was a drone.\n\n\u201cAfter what were likely valid sightings of possibly hobbyist drones, every aircraft can then become suspicious,\u201d he said.\n\nHoaxes, UFOs, witches, drones: NJ is no stranger to strange happenings\n\nKirby said during a news conference that authorities haven\u2019t been able to corroborate \u201cany of the reported visual sightings\u201d \u2014 despite using \u201cvery sophisticated electronic detection technologies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe FBI, DHS and our federal partners, in close coordination with the New Jersey State Police, continue to deploy personnel and technology to investigate this situation and confirm whether the reported drone flights are actually drones or are instead manned aircraft or otherwise inaccurate sightings,\u201d the agencies said in the statement.\n\nForeign government surveillance?\n\nU.S. government officials this week assured the public that the spotted aircraft do not appear to be sent by a foreign government, quashing a theory posed by Van Drew, who said the drones could be controlled by Iran.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence the drones pose a national security threat, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday. The sightings may actually be piloted aircraft operating legally, the agencies said. Also worth noting: the craft haven\u2019t flown in restricted airspace, they said.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, they have uncovered no such malicious activity or intent at this stage,\u201d a joint statement from the agencies said. \u201cWhile there is no known malicious activity occurring in New Jersey, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight the insufficiency of current authorities.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNew Jersey lawmakers told the Asbury Park Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, said they were briefed by State Police and told authorities don\u2019t know where the drones are coming from, and are unable to detect them.\n\n\u201cListen, I hope it\u2019s no big deal, but the federal government needs to be more truthful.\u201d New Jersey Assemblyman Greg Myhre said.\n\nUS government drones?\n\nGovernment officials including the Pentagon said the drones spotted by residents for the last few weeks are not operated by the U.S. government or military.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely that a government organization would be flying the drones over public locations, Direen said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cClearly they are not being very stealthy if they are,\u201d he said.\n\nKids playing a prank, or hobbyists?\n\nCould the drones people keep seeing be someone playing a prank, or drone hobbyists just out having a good time? It\u2019s not illegal to fly drones in New Jersey, but you have to meet certain requirements depending on the size of the drone and the reason you\u2019re flying it, according to federal and state laws.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it should be pretty easy for officials to figure out, Direen said.\n\n\u201cIf the drones are being flown legally, the ADS-B transponder on the drone should make it easy for authorities to identify the drone and the operator,\u201d he said.\n\nUFOs?\n\nCould the drones be the work of aliens? At this point, officials have given no evidence to suggest that, but also no evidence to debunk it. (And many UFO sightings are believed to have natural explanations.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI suppose some alien kids could be flying their toy drones while their parents are busy out abducting humans and performing experiments on them,\u201d Direen said.\n\nIs it legal to shoot down a drone in California?\n\nNo. It is illegal to try to shoot down or destroy a drone that trespasses on private property or above public spaces because it may cause safety risks.\n\nAs of Oct. 1, 791,597 drones are registered in the U.S., according to the Federal Aviation Administration, including 396,746 commercial drones and 387,746 recreational drones.\n\nRegardless of the drone's classification, however, the FAA considers them aircraft \u2014 meaning that you could be charged with shooting at an aircraft, a federal crime if you take a shot at one.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf you believe a drone is violating the law, your best bet is to contact law enforcement.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information, correct a misspelling/typo and to change or add a photo or video.)\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Mass drone sightings prompt worries, but there may be an explanation"

            "article_content": "If you\u2019re seeing and hearing drones or other such flying things flashing in the sky, it\u2019s absolutely certain that you are not imagining it and you are not alone. However, what remains troublingly uncertain is what is actually going on and it\u2019s a question that government has done a lousy job answering.\n\nThe future head of that government, Donald Trump, said yesterday: \u201cThe government knows what is happening. For some reason, they don\u2019t want to comment. And I think they\u2019d be better off saying what it is our military knows and our president knows.\u201d\n\nWe often disagree with Trump, but his call for transparency is sound.\n\nWhat do the sightings mean? Hopefully not a real life \u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d invasion copying Orson Welles\u2019 1938 fictional radio show Martian attack, also in New Jersey. The unsatisfying answer is we don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019ll venture that it\u2019s unlikely that this is some sort of sophisticated foreign intelligence operation that federal officials are somehow unaware of.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s some kind of undisclosed military program that Trump mentioned, or coordinated pranks or, as is may be the case with these things, a phenomenon that\u2019s taken a life of its own when there\u2019s no there there.\n\nA few experts and officials have already pointed out that at least some of the sightings seem to be commercial planes. One Jersey resident claimed to have shined a laser pointer at a \u201cdrone\u201d that seems to have really been a FedEx plane. Needless to say, do not do this; risking plane crashes is the opposite of helpful as we try to figure out what\u2019s going on.\n\nThis is all representative of a broader and more acute reality than whatever is going on with these particular sightings: we have more or less lost the ability to contend with and clarify things like this as a society. Conspiracy theories are nothing new, and neither is distrusting official sources of information. Some of our greatest advances as a society and moments of public accountability and reform have come from people going against and questioning narratives.\n\nInstead, we\u2019re faced with something like a choose-your-own-adventure for reality, where every amateur sleuth and social media voice gets a chance to run wild and potentially cause significant damage with their laser pointer exploits.\n\nThe culture of secrecy at the nation\u2019s law enforcement and military entities has left them tight-lipped in a way that the public just takes as confirmation that there\u2019s something nefarious going on, as Trump suggests, and the news media\u2019s cautious reporting, responsive to what we know to be true, is seen as evasive and dismissive.\n\nPeople want there to be clear-cut answers, now. The idea that this could be a series of misidentifications of commercial planes, faraway planets and hobbyists drones (or probably all of the above) even if that turns out to be the correct answer, may not be welcomed by a public that seems hungry for something else.\n\nSo, let\u2019s just go through each sighting, one by one, and determine its cause. The Martians patiently planned their attack in \u201cThe War of the Worlds;\u201d will Americans have the same level of patience?"

            "article_content": "The Hubble tension is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology.\n\nIt centers around the Hubble constant\u2014the measurement of how fast our universe is expanding\u2014which comes out as two different numbers when calculated two different ways, even though those numbers should always match.\n\nNow, the James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that this tension is real, rather than a miscalculation or a problem with our equipment. That means there\u2019s something in the underlying physics of our universe that remains a mystery.\n\nThe Hubble tension is one of the most hotly debated discrepancies in all of astronomy. It centers around a number called the Hubble constant, which is functionally the rate at which our universe is expanding. Yup, our infinite universe is expanding. Trippy.\n\nWe\u2019ve known that this expansion is a fact of our cosmos for a while now (we also know that expansion is speeding up, but that\u2019s another story). But we still don\u2019t know exactly how fast this expansion is happening\u2014we don\u2019t know what the Hubble constant is. And it\u2019s not for lack of trying, either.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere\u2019s a few ways you can measure the Hubble Constant, but there are two major ones. The first, which is how the Hubble Telescope itself does it, is to figure out how fast the things around us are moving away from us. This is done by targeting specific, reliable objects in the sky, calculating the distances to them, and combining those distance with measurements of redshift (a phenomenon that happens when an object moves away from our vantage point, stretching out the light its sending our way and making it appear redder). This is called a local measurement, and it results in a Hubble constant of around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc).\n\nThe second way is to look at the Big Bang. Well, not directly\u2014that\u2019s currently impossible. But we can look at the cosmic microwave background, which is the radiation from the Big Bang that permeates every \u2018corner\u2019 of our universe. By studying this ancient radiation, we can get a reading of what the Hubble constant would have been back when the universe began, and then use our knowledge of the laws of physics to functionally fast-forward and find what that Hubble constant should be now. Using this method, we get a predicted Hubble constant of around 68 km/s/Mpc.\n\nAnd that is the Hubble tension\u2014those numbers should be the same, but they\u2019re not. And when expectation doesn\u2019t match observation in astronomy, it means one of two things: there\u2019s something wrong with our measurement techniques, or there\u2019s something wrong with our understanding of physics.\n\nNow, more and more, it\u2019s looking like the latter. A recent paper\u2014led by Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for his discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating and, by extension, his discovery of dark energy\u2014announced that observations from the James Webb Space Telescope further confirm Hubble\u2019s measurements of the local Hubble constant. According to our absolute best space telescope, the Hubble constant is around 73 km/s/Mpc (which is within the margin of error of the original Hubble measurement), not the ~68 km/s/Mpc it should be.\n\nIt might be fair to have a little bit of a \u201cso what?\u201d reaction to this news. After all, when you boil it down, the only thing we\u2019ve discovered is that there is in fact something we still don\u2019t understand about the expansion of the universe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the excitement behind this announcement comes from the fact that this new measurement confirms that the Hubble tension is real. It\u2019s not a quirk of an old telescope\u2014it\u2019s actually a problem. And that means this isn\u2019t some trivial squabble. There\u2019s something we don\u2019t know about the basic physics that underpin our entire cosmos.\n\nScientists are going to keep pushing to understand exactly what we\u2019re missing that is leading to this discrepancy. And if our scientific history is anything to go by, someday, they\u2019ll figure it out. And when they do, we\u2019re going to have entirely new physics on our hands. How exciting.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

            "article_content": "QUESTION: Why was antimony so prized by alchemists?\n\nSir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), the towering genius of the Scientific Revolution, was dubbed \u2018the last of the magicians\u2019 by John Maynard Keynes. It is often forgotten that Newton was obsessed with alchemy, having written more than a million words on the subject.\n\nAlchemy was an ancient practice that combined elements of science, philosophy and mysticism. It aimed to transform base metals like lead into noble ones such as gold, discover a universal elixir of life, and understand the fundamental nature of matter and existence.\n\nAntimony\u2019s very reactivity with usually inert elements made it fascinating to alchemists.\n\nNewton held that antimony, along with quicksilver (mercury), was the foundation of alchemy: \u2018That other (and properly named) chalybs is antimony for it is created from nature of itself (without art) and it is the beginning of the work.\u2019 (In alchemy the chalybs was a foundation chemical of \u2018the Art\u2019.)\n\nOutside its supposed alchemical properties, antimony is a chemical element belonging to the nitrogen group. It has the atomic number 51 and is a lustrous, silvery-grey semi-metal with a flaky texture. Unlike typical metals, antimony is not malleable but hard and brittle and can be crushed to a powder.\n\nA unique property of antimony is that, because its solid form is less dense than its liquid form, it expands as it freezes (like water).\n\nThe word antimony comes from the Greek anti and monos: \u2018a metal not found alone\u2019 and it can be found in more than 100 different minerals. Its chemical symbol is Sb, which comes from the element\u2019s historical Latin name, stibium.\n\nAntimony became widely used in Medieval times, mainly to harden lead, although some was taken medicinally as a laxative pill. Today about half of all antimony is used to make antimony trioxide for flame-proofing.\n\nSir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), English Mathematician And Physicist. Colored English Line And Stipple Engraving, 19th Century\n\nCharles Rees, Warwick\n\nQUESTION: What became of New Zealand\u2019s Moriori people?\n\nThe Moriori were an indigenous Polynesian people who settled the Chatham Islands, east of New Zealand, around the 14th century. They had a relatively peaceful hunter-gatherer lifestyle, relying on seal meat and seafood and adapting to the Chatham Islands\u2019 harsh and cold environment.\n\nTomorrow's questions:\n\n\n\nQ: It took 24 years for Gladiator II to be released after Gladiator. What are the longest time gaps between original feature films andtheir first sequel? John Rutherford, Sevenoaks, Kent Q: What did the Keeper of the King\u2019s Conscience do? Martine Garner, Norwich Q: Was a postbox installed in a crematorium? What was it for? Will Livesy, Truro, Cornwall Advertisement\n\nThey developed a pacifist, collectivist culture known as the law of Nunuku, based on the teachings of the 16th-century Moriori leader Nunuku-whenua.\n\nMeanwhile, the main islands of New Zealand were settled by the Maori, who developed an agricultural and warlike society, with fortified villages and organised tribal structures.\n\nIn 1835, Maori tribes from mainland New Zealand invaded the Chatham Islands, seeking new resources and territory. The Moriori, adhering to their principle of nonviolence, did not resist. They were enslaved and killed. The Moriori population fell from around 1,600 to fewer than 100 within 30 years.\n\nA Moriori survivor recalled: \u2018[They] commenced to kill us like sheep... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed.\u2019\n\nThe Moriori suffered injustice after injustice; after 30 years of slavery, the Chatham Islands were awarded to their invaders in an 1870 Native Land Court decision.\n\nThere was a systematic portrayal of Moriori as a \u2018lazy, stupid people\u2019 genetically distinct from Maori and Polynesians. This description could be found in a 1916 copy of School Journals, a series of educational magazines used across New Zealand elementary schools. The last known full-blooded Moriori, Tommy Solomon (Tame Horomona Rehe), died in 1933.\n\nEmilia Turner, London SE27\n\nQUESTION: Is Valiasr Street in Tehran the longest residential street in the world?\n\nValiasr Street, the longest in the Iranian capital (and in the Middle East), spans 11 miles from Rahahan Square in the south to Tajrish Square in the north. Built in the 1920s under Reza Shah Pahlavi, it was originally called Pahlavi Street. It was renamed Valiasr or Vali-e Asr following the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\n\nValiasr Street is the longest in the Iranian capital, Tehran (pictured) and it spans 11 miles from Rahahan Square in the south to Tajrish Square in the north\n\nYonge Street in Toronto, Canada, is the longest street in the world. Measuring 34 miles, it connects Lake Ontario in the south to Lake Simcoe in the north.\n\nThe longest street in Britain is disputed, with both Duke Street in Glasgow and King Street in Aberdeen commonly claiming to be two miles long.\n\nSteven Lewis, Coventry"
