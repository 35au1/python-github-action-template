            "article_content": "When pilot Kenneth Arnold took off from Chehalis, Washington, in his single-engine airplane one afternoon in June 1947, he was looking for a lost military aircraft that had crashed. But what he found was something completely different\u2014something that would set off a cultural obsession in the U.S. that persists today.\n\nWhile flying around Mount Rainier, Arnold reportedly encountered nine curious, wingless objects speeding through the sky at 1,200 mph, faster than any plane at the time could. Arnold spent years afterward trying to describe what he had seen, reportedly using a term that has been ingrained in the American lexicon ever since: \"flying saucer.\"\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSince then, Americans have been uniquely fixated on the idea that aliens are somewhere in the sky above us\u2014and the number who believe that to be true is growing. In 2019, a Gallup survey found that 33% of Americans believed some UFOs were alien spacecrafts, while 60% felt they could all be explained by human activity or some natural phenomenon. Just two years later, in 2021, 41% of respondents said they believed at least some UFOs were alien-related compared to 50% who were confident any sightings could be explained by human behavior or scientific events.\n\nThere are two main reasons that belief in aliens has become so prevalent in the United States: government hearings and pop culture.\n\nAmerica's film industry has always been one of the most influential in the world, and a wave of science fiction films in the 1950s, like \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" and \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" perpetuated the idea that there are other life-forms out there. This continues today with alien-centric sci-fi staples like the \"Avatar\" franchise and the \"Quiet Place\" movies dominating the box office.\n\nRather than leave flying saucers to the domain of Hollywood, the U.S. government has addressed the question of UFOs, only adding further speculation. In April 2020, the Department of Defense released multiple videos filmed by military pilots that were thought to possibly capture UFOs. In July 2023, an Air Force veteran came forward to the House of Representatives claiming that the U.S. military has been keeping important information on \"nonhuman\" sightings secret since the 1930s.\n\nJust like it did in the 1950s amid Cold War paranoia, the lore of UFOs is also currently experiencing a resurgence as many Americans grow concerned about national security. The infamous Chinese spy balloon panic in 2023 and fears over being infiltrated by the Russian government have led to many reporting seeing UFOs in the sky. People are also mistaking the spike in Starlink satellites for extraterrestrial activity. In November 2024, the Pentagon announced that most reported sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs, as they're now known) can be attributed to balloons, drones, and other regular objects, while still noting that many objects lack a sufficient explanation.\n\nUAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it's easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they've seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWhile New Mexico and Nevada are perhaps best known for UFO sightings, the National UFO Reporting Center data shows that the state with the most sightings is California, with more than 16,500 reports as of Nov. 21, 2024. But what do the numbers look like in your metro area?\n\nStacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Florida using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis.\n\nFor now, the U.S. government's official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America's alien obsession.\n\nNote: The images in this article are stock photos and do not necessarily depict the specific cities or events described listed.\n\nYou may also like: What Medicaid acceptance looks like at Florida substance use treatment centers\n\nIgorZh // Shutterstock\n\n#10.

            "article_content": "The more exciting, transformative, and revolutionary a science result appears, especially coming out of nowhere, the more likely it is to be dead wrong. So, approach science headlines with a healthy amount of skepticism and patience\n\nIn 2014 astronomers announced a whopper of a discovery: primordial waves from the earliest moments of the big bang. The South Pole telescope results validated the long-standing but still-shaky hypothesis of cosmic inflation, the scenario where the extremely early universe underwent a period of massively accelerated expansion. News reports went wild, as did the scientists involved in the study, in a celebratory news conference.\n\nBut it was all just a bunch of dust. Literally, dust. The team did not properly account for the impact of interstellar dust in their analysis. With proper calibration, the paradigm-shifting result disappeared.\n\nOr remember Tabby\u2019s Star? In 2015 astronomers speculated that its strange light pattern might be the product of alien megastructures. Cue media circus, high-profile talks, the works. Further analysis revealed that it was \u2026dust, again.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nMore recently, a group of astronomers claimed to find phosphine in abundance in the Venusian atmosphere, proposing that there might be some form of exotic life floating in the cloud tops. After the media hype died down, other researchers found significant flaws in the original analysis (at least it wasn\u2019t dust this time).\n\nIt\u2019s not just astronomy. Neutrinos can travel faster than light. Mozart makes your kids smarter. Dyeing your hair gives you cancer. Smartphones make us stupid.\n\nVery, very stunning. But very, very wrong.\n\nThe strong correlation between flashiness and wrongness comes from several factors. First, much, if not most, scientific research is wrong. That\u2019s why it\u2019s research; if we knew the answers ahead of time, we wouldn\u2019t need to do science. Many scientific papers are speculative, dependent on hyperspecific assumptions of controlled parameters, or just crazy ideas shot into the dark. It\u2019s through this constant bubbling of ideas and results and studies that we poke and prod at nature\u2019s workings, hoping to tease out some glimmer of deeper understanding.\n\nSecond, scientists endure perverse incentives to publish as much as possible\u2014to \u201cpublish or perish\u201d\u2014and to get their results in top-tier journals as much as possible. Since the biggest ones only take on the most impactful research, there is tremendous pressure in academia to inflate results and make big, bold claims, increasing the chances that their tenuous results will not hold up to further scrutiny.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s the modern-day hype machine. While many journalists respect scientists and want to faithfully represent the results of scientific research, publishers face their own incentives to capture eyeballs and clicks and downloads. The more sensational the story, the better.\n\nTrust in science continues to decline, reports the Pew Research Center, falling to only 57 percent of survey respondents viewing it as more positive than negative for society. I believe that\u2019s in part due to flagrant overinflation of scientific results. The more times that the public sees science contradict itself, the less likely people are to believe the next result that makes headlines. And the more times that scientists are loudly, publicly wrong, the more ammunition antiscience groups have in their fight against trusted experts.\n\nIt\u2019s not to say that science results can\u2019t be both interesting and right. The discovery of gravitational waves from merging black holes in 2015 was supremely fascinating, and exactly right. The release of the mRNA vaccines to fight the coronavirus pandemic were nothing short of miraculous\u2014and they did the job.\n\nThe vast majority of the time, though, from my experience in the worlds of science and science communication, if a result is interesting, it\u2019s probably wrong. And let me be clear here. I\u2019m sure you find most, if not all, scientific research absolutely fascinating\u2014as do I. But the more interesting a result is to the wider community, with more headlines, chatter, attention and raised eyebrows, the more likely it is to be worthy of a bit of healthy skepticism.\n\nJust peruse the latest batch of articles from your favorite science journal. Once you get past the technical jargon, you\u2019ll find that many papers are, in a way, boring. Not boring in the sense of not worth reading or exploring further, but boring in the sense that they would not make the pages of a high-impact journal, let alone your local newspaper. Most scientific papers are small steps, methodological techniques or slightly-off-the-beaten-path theoretical detours. Most scientific results come slowly, incrementally and with little fanfare.\n\nOnly a slim fraction of science results makes it from the journals to the newspapers, and even fewer make global headlines. The broad public only gets to view science through a highly filtered lens, and what makes it through that filter has a greater chance of being wrong.\n\nThe best approach to take with science results, news, and headlines is the same approach scientists use themselves: healthy skepticism.\n\nFirst, look at the timeline. Amazing results can be right, but they\u2019re usually backed by years, if not decades, of consistent, steady progress in those directions. It took a quarter century of effort before gravitational waves were found, and the roots of the mRNA vaccines go back to the 1990s. A big, successful result is usually the final step of a slow and steady slog.\n\nSecond, look at the scope. Bigger claims, with more far-reaching or broad conclusions, usually don\u2019t hold up. Good individual studies usually have carefully crafted limitations and clearly stated caveats; it takes a comprehensive effort from a community of scientists to build up a general consensus. Climate change proved true over time, black holes were a fringe possibility that added up in repeated observations, and exoplanets were searched for over decades before the first one was finally spotted in 1992.\n\nLastly, just be patient. Science is in part organized skepticism, and the first group of people to rigorously attack a new idea will be other scientists. New studies may rebuke, reaffirm or revise an existing result. Only time, and countless hours of work, will reveal if a conclusion holds up to scrutiny and the ultimate judgment of evidence.\n\nBeware big headlines; don\u2019t believe everything you see. But when study after study comes out, building up an interconnected latticework of theory and experiment, allow your beliefs to shift, because that\u2019s when the process of science has likely led to an interesting and useful conclusion. It\u2019s ironically through this process of healthy skepticism that trust in science can be regained. By viewing science results through a scientific lens\u2014initially skeptical but allowing beliefs to shift along with the weight of evidence\u2014we can develop the intuition we need to reject sensational headlines but know when a new result is right.\n\nIn the meantime, just remember that if it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s probably wrong.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

The upcoming Witcher installment, which is set to kick off a new trilogy of AAA Witcher games , has now entered full-scale production , with game director Sebastian Kalemba saying that there's \"no stopping now!\" On top of that, it's been reiterated that Polaris's development is still ahead of the pack when compared to the likes of the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel ( codenamed Orion ) and the mysterious new IP, Hadar .\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a short video posted to YouTube following the company's financial results, CD Projekt chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz says Polaris began full-scale production \"several weeks ago\" and adds: \"Of all our projects, this one is currently the most far along, and we're starting the most intensive phase of development.\"\n\nThis echoes what associate game director on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, Pawe\u0142 Sasko, said back in July, when he confirmed that The Witcher 4 was the \"most advanced\" game in terms of the progress that had been made on it in comparison to CD Projekt Red's other ongoing works. Obviously, the situation has evolved since then, since Nielubowicz says it's only in the last \"several weeks\" that Polaris has entered full-scale production, so things have been moving forward behind the scenes.\n\nWhat that means for its release window is a completely separate matter, though - CD Projekt Red hasn't given any indication of when we could expect the game to be shown off, never mind completed. In the meantime, fans are already hard at work trying to work out what a new teaser image of some strange coins might mean , as some theorize it could tie into The Witcher 4's plot."
