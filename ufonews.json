A sphere was spotted over Cumbernauld on April 21, 2021, while a similar-shaped object was clocked the following day over Hamilton \u201cmoving oddly and hovering in the sky\u201d.\n\nAn orb was viewed above Cumbernauld on August 24, 2021, and appeared to be \u201cmoving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times\u201d, and the following day three objects were seen \u201cmoving back and forward. blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds\u201d above East Kilbride.\n\n(Image: Freelance)\n\nThey are amongst 395 sightings across the United Kingdom \u2013 and an updated interactive map reveals the extent of the unexplained activity taking place in the skies above us.\n\nUFOs have been in the news recently following a spate of sightings on the east coast of the United States.\n\nAnd last year the US Congress attempted to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u2018Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u2019 heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts.\n\nUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).\n\nExperts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold \u2013 former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team \u2013 told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d.\n\nHowever, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US assets and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d\n\nHe insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies.\n\nWhile the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be.\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings in the UK (48 per cent) include photographic or video evidence.\n\nA quarter of all sightings (25 per cent) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17 per cent), \u201csphere\u201d, (10 per cent) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (nine per cent).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34).\n\nWhen it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters \u2013 which possibly explains the high sightings in nearby Lanarkshire.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSIGHTINGS ACROSS LANARKSHIRE\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 21/04/2021\n\nDescription: Object moving north to east and then changed back to a northerly direction then disappeared.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 22/04/2021\n\nDescription: Reflective ball-object moving oddly and hovering in the sky.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 16/05/2021\n\nDescription: Two lights travelling parallel at slow speed, before fading away behind a cloud.\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Orb\n\nDate spotted: 24/08/2021\n\nDescription: Light changed from white to red, moving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 25/08/2021\n\nDescription: Three objects moving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 27/09/2021\n\nDescription: Triangular beam of light like a search light moving at a steady rate, brighter at the top.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Disc\n\nDate spotted: 28/12/2021\n\nDescription: Three saucer shaped objects appearing stationary, in photograph, not seen with naked eye.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 11/02/2022\n\nDescription: Three stars in a straight line formation, moving very fast from west to east then fading from view.\n\nAirdrie\n\nShape of UFO: Cylinder\n\nDate spotted: 27/06/2022\n\nDescription: Object \u2018like a plane with no wings\u2019 flying high up with no vapour trail.\n\nUddingston\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 17/11/2023\n\nDescription: Orange light appeared to be making a tear in the sky.

Credit: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAdult content, including AI-generated nudes, remains banned on Facebook and Instagram, despite recent policy changes at Meta.\n\nHowever, that hasn't stopped \"nudify\" apps \u2014 platforms that create nonconsensual AI-generated nudes of celebrities and influencers \u2014 from advertising on Meta's platforms. And those ads have been extremely successful for at least one service called Crush AI.\n\nAccording to a new report from 404Media , as originally reported in Alexios Mantzarlis' Faked Up newsletter, the Crush AI modifier app receives the vast majority of its traffic from Meta platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. According to Similarweb's data, last month Crush AI received more than a quarter of a million visits to its service \u2014 and roughly 90 percent of that traffic was from Meta's platforms.\n\nCrush AI makes it quite clear what the purpose of its service is in its advertisements. The company's ads include photos of real-life individuals like Instagram influencer and model Mikayla Demaiter and OnlyFans creator Sophie Rain. The ads boast that users can \"upload a photo\" and \"erase anyone's clothes.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Crush AI creates fake profile pages using AI-generated profile pictures and runs new ads using those pages. The ads promote different domain names that then redirect to Crush AI when clicked.\n\nMashable has previously reported on other deepfakes and AI platforms that utilize Meta's advertising platform to generate traffic and revenue from AI-generated adult content. These ads are strictly against Meta's policies, and the company often removes them once it becomes aware of specific advertisements.\n\nHowever, as 404Media previously reported , Meta appears to have different standards for ad moderation. Policy-breaking content published by users as Facebook or Instagram posts will often be automatically detected by Meta and subsequently removed. Yet, that same content will not be detected when uploaded to Meta's advertising platform."

Like, one of my favorite memes I've seen so far is just like, \"hello, Americans, show us your cats!\" Like, if there's one thing that binds the internet, it's that we all love cat pictures, you know?\"While China has for years tightly controlled its cyberspace through its \"Great Firewall\" - and Chinese social media platforms have in the past run separate domestic and abroad versions of their apps, RedNote is unique as it only maintains one version of its app and it gives both Chinese and American users a rare opportunity to interact directly with each other.\"I'm not sure how many of the new users will actually stick around and hang out. But I hope that they do.\"\"Because I think that that would be a really important shift in cultural exchange that for the first time in a long time, puts the ball in China's court a little bit more. But then even more specifically, puts the ball in the hands of Chinese people in China.\"In China, RedNote as a platform is popular for finding recommendations for beauty, travel or food.On Wednesday many of its users posted selfies and messages welcoming new American users.Though Beijing-based academic Liu Xingliang, who studies the digital economy, says RedNote was caught unprepared.\"It is an accident. But since it is an accident, it is actually good for them, and there also may be certain risks. If they want to catch this wave of prosperity, I think they may have to do at least a few things. The first thing is to make your interface and UI more friendly.\"\"It is the first time that a large number of people have had such a very large-scale exchange, and the exchanges between the two sides are relaxed and enthusiastic. From what I've seen, they were all learning about each other's living habits, local conditions and customs.\"There were also signs that some new foreign users were testing the platform's censorship limits with some posting on social media network X that they were unable to post about topics known to be sensitive in China such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.For now - China's welcoming the migration of TikTokers to RedNote with open arms.Chinese state media CCTV ran reports saying that TikTok users had found a \"new home\".And China's foreign ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday the use of social media is a \"personal choice\", and China \"encourages and supports\" people-to-people exchanges."

If you don\u2019t like found-footage movies, Paranormal Activity or The Blair Witch Project won\u2019t bother you. Some people might say The Exorcist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre look a bit dated, and that\u2019s before we get to zombie movies.\n\nHowever, every now and again, a film arrives that seems to get under everyone\u2019s skin; something that\u2019s more than jumpscares, a movie that feels irresistibly insidious.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nHereditary is arguably the most iconic horror movie of the past 10 years, and if you\u2019ve never seen it (or perhaps you want to spook yourself again), it\u2019s on Netflix now.\n\nHereditary is now streaming on Netflix\n\nHereditary is available to stream on Netflix in the US now (if you\u2019re based elsewhere, just use a VPN to change your location to anywhere in North America).\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nThe 2018 movie, directed by Ari Aster, follows the Graham family after the death of their secretive, troubled grandmother. As they try to grieve, a sinister force drives them towards unimaginable terrors.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nThat is a vague description of the plot, but it\u2019s to protect the film\u2019s secrets from those who\u2019ve yet to see it \u2013 in other words, if you know, you know. Beyond that, I can tell you this: it stars Toni Collette (who was robbed of an Oscar), Alex Wolff, Gabriel Byrne, Milly Shapiro, and Ann Dowd.\n\nA24\n\nIt topped our list of the best horror movies of all time, in which we wrote: \u201cDuring my screening of Hereditary, my fianc\u00e9e openly wept for three-quarters of the film, and multiple couples, shielding their sight, leaped for the doors in the final act.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\n\u201cTo the eyes that just rolled, let me assure you: it is that scary, but sacrificing your sleep will pale next to the film\u2019s rewards. It\u2019s a once-in-a-generation nightmare machine, with Toni Collette giving the best performance in all of horror.\u201d\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced, find out more about the real-life accident that inspired Hereditary\u2019s most horrific scene (spoiler warning, obviously). You can also check out other new movies on streaming this month and the biggest horror movies coming out in 2025."

            "article_content": "David Baker, winner of the latest Nobel Prize in Chemistry, claims that humanity is undergoing a transformation as momentous as learning to handle metals at the end of the Stone Age. He speaks of \u201cthe protein design revolution,\u201d comparable to the Industrial Revolution, which changed the planet with its steam engines. His laboratory at the University of Washington announced on Wednesday that its disruptive artificial intelligence programs, for which Baker won the Nobel Prize, have succeeded for the first time in creating a treatment for a disease forgotten by big pharmaceutical companies. At the forefront of this scientific feat is the Mexican biochemist Susana V\u00e1zquez, who has just left the United States to join the National Cancer Research Center in Madrid, Spain.\n\nBaker\u2019s lab invents proteins that don\u2019t exist in nature. A couple of years ago, its members presented \u201cthe world\u2019s first computationally designed protein medicine\u201d: a vaccine against Covid, called SKYCovione, which is already in use in the United Kingdom and South Korea. The researchers have also created some promising molecules against the flu and brain cancer. In her final year of her PhD, V\u00e1zquez proposed trying one of the 23 neglected tropical diseases according to the World Health Organization: snakebite envenoming, which causes more than 100,000 deaths a year and three times as many amputations. She and her colleagues used RFdiffusion and ProteinMPNN, two artificial intelligence programs that designed previously nonexistent proteins capable of neutralizing the deadly toxins in cobra bites, at least in computer simulations.\n\nV\u00e1zquez, born in Quer\u00e9taro 31 years ago, was jogging in Seattle when she received an email with the first results of the animal experiments. \u201cMy heart stopped and I had to stop to read the email. It was super exciting, because some of the mice had survived 100% of lethal doses of venom,\u201d she recalls. Her study was published this Wednesday in the journal Nature, a showcase of the best science in the world. The authors believe that, beyond snake bites, their initial success suggests that artificial intelligence \u201ccan help democratize the discovery of therapies,\u201d especially in the case of devastating neglected diseases, thanks to the \u201csubstantial\u201d savings in money and resources.\n\nMore than two million people suffer snakebites every year, mostly in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The injected toxins can cause paralysis and bleeding. Despite the magnitude of the problem, current treatments employ a crude and often ineffective strategy developed more than a century ago: injecting horses with snake venom, extracting their blood and obtaining the specific antibodies generated. \u201cUnfortunately, there is very little funding, either from academic institutions or from large pharmaceutical companies, to improve current treatments for snakebites,\u201d laments V\u00e1zquez.\n\nDavid Baker, born in Seattle 62 years ago, won half of last year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The other half was divided between Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, two researchers at Google DeepMind who were instrumental in developing AlphaFold, a system that predicts the structure of proteins with unprecedented accuracy. To understand the complexity of the challenge, a water molecule has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, with the simple formula H\u2082O. The protein that allows us to breathe, the hemoglobin that makes our blood red, is C\u2082\u2089\u2085\u2082H\u2084\u2086\u2086\u2084N\u2088\u2081\u2082O\u2088\u2083\u2082S\u2088Fe\u2084.\n\nBaker distances himself from the American multinational. \u201cThere is a big difference between my laboratory, which is totally open, we receive visitors from all over the world and we share information, and a company like Deepmind, which is totally closed,\u201d the researcher stressed in an interview with EL PA\u00cdS in 2023. \u201cBeing an open system gives you many more ideas. The free exchange of information benefits the advancement of science,\u201d he said. Google DeepMind opened part of its systems after Baker shared his for free.\n\nAmerican biochemist David Baker in his laboratory at the University of Washington. FBBVA\n\nThe Nobel Prize winner was very optimistic in a message sent to this newspaper on Tuesday. \u201cI think designed proteins could help with many problem diseases!\u201d exclaims Baker, director of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington. \u201cThe advantage of design is that you can build in all the properties needed in the drug\u2014this is very hard to do with other current methods of drug discovery,\u201d he argues.\n\nThe Belgian biotechnologist Els Torreele helped found the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), a nonprofit that seeks new treatments for conditions that affect more than 1 billion people. Torreele changed the face of pharmaceuticals in 2019 when she led M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\u2019 campaign for access to essential medicines. She and her colleagues wanted to prove that inventing a drug doesn\u2019t cost \u20ac2.5 billion, as Big Pharma claimed. They succeeded. DNDi invested \u20ac55 million in developing fexinidazole, the first oral treatment for sleeping sickness, an infection transmitted by tsetse flies and caused by parasites that inflame the brain.\n\nTorreele is skeptical about the promise of \u201cdemocratization\u201d that comes with artificial intelligence. \u201cDemocratizing drug discovery would assume that access to the big data and high-power computational tools would become widely available and affordable, such that anyone can use those in their labs. I doubt that this will be the case any time soon, given the costs of big data, data centers, and computational capacity (including carbon footprint),\u201d says the biotechnologist.\n\nThe Belgian researcher does not believe that the generation of candidate drug molecules is the main bottleneck for drug development, at least in most diseases. Torreele believes that the real challenge \u2013 faced with a pharmaceutical industry that wants maximum benefits from its investments \u2013 is in the expensive clinical trials with thousands of people, to prove that an experimental treatment is safe and effective.\n\n\u201cWith less (donor) finance overall for global health, also the non-profits like DNDi increasingly struggle to mobilize funds,\u201d Torreele warns. \u201cOf course it\u2019s nice to have more drug candidates, but getting them developed into actual medicines in ways that deliver affordable and equitable access to patients when and where needed is the main bottleneck today, and I don\u2019t see how AI is going to be helpful on that,\u201d she warns.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

            "article_content": "Claudia Schimmel and her husband felt sticker shock when they received their car insurance renewal notice last fall. The six-month premium to insure the Lindenhurst couple\u2019s 2023 Volkswagen SUV and 2019 Ram pickup truck with Geico increased in November by about $500, or 30%, to $2,223, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to shift a few things around, definitely,\" said Schimmel, 31, the mother of a 2-year-old boy. \"The excess spending on toys and things like that definitely goes down.\u201d She and her husband plan to shop around for cheaper insurance, she said. They're not alone. Surging auto insurance premiums, driven by the rising cost of claims and other factors, have led to a record number of consumers shopping for cheaper policies. Analytics company LexisNexis Risk Solutions ranked New York third among the states with the largest annual increases in shopping growth in the third quarter of 2024, reporting a 58% jump. The most expensive auto insurance in 2024 in Nassau County\u2014and on Long Island \u2014 was in an Inwood ZIP code, 11096, where the annual average premium was $4,464 last year, 52% higher than a year earlier, according to The Zebra, an insurance comparison company. The second-highest premium was in a Valley Stream ZIP code, 11581, where the 2024 average was $4,436, a 53% hike from the 2023 price. Nassau County's average insurance rates are higher than Suffolk County's, partly due to Nassau's higher wages and its proximity to heavily congested New York City, which has the state's highest premiums. But Suffolk car owners are still feeling the pinch. The highest auto insurance rate in Suffolk County was in a Brentwood ZIP code, 11717, where the annual average premium in 2024 reached $3,653 \u2014 a 43% increase compared to 2023, according to The Zebra. A Central Islip ZIP code, 11722, ranked second with a $3,640 average premium in 2024 \u2014 also a 43% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, the statewide average rose 50% to $2,526 last year compared to the national average, which increased 19% to $2,189, according to The Zebra\u2019s \u201c2025 Auto Insurance Trends Report.\u201d The rising costs are leading some car owners to make difficult decisions, experts said. An increasing number of motorists are going uninsured, said David Seider, chief commercialization officer at The Zebra, which is based in Austin, Texas. \"The trend is totally understandable, as Americans have grappled with how to manage basic household spending amidst rapidly inflating costs on everything from groceries to rent,\" Seider said. Car insurance prices are rising for several reasons, including an increase in the number of car accidents and their severity, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a Malvern, Pennsylvania-based nonprofit that represents the insurance industry. \u201cThere have also been more fatalities and injuries, leading to increased attorney involvement in claims,\u201d institute spokeswoman Loretta L. Worters said. Cars are being built with more advanced technology, which saves lives but also makes repairs more costly, she said. Wildfires, flooding and other weather disasters also are a factor in insurers raising rates to account for financial losses, according to The Zebra report, which cited the 24 separate billion-dollar weather events last year in the U.S., including Hurricanes Helene and Milton on the East Coast. While the rising costs of parts and labor to repair cars contribute to higher insurance premiums, a bigger factor is the greed of insurance companies whose rate hikes have exceeded the nation\u2019s overall rate of inflation, argued Michael DeLong, a research and advocacy associate at the Consumer Federation of America, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group. \u201cAnd most of the [states\u2019] insurance regulators are letting them get away with it,\u201d he said. Insurers seeking to raise premiums in the state must get approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, but there are exceptions. The state has a \u201cflex rating\u201d law that allows insurers to raise premiums by an average of less than 5% in a 12-month period without seeking department approval. \u201cAll auto rates, whether prior approval or flex rating, must be actuarially justified and cannot be excessive, inadequate, destructive of competition, or detrimental to the solvency of insurers,\u201d according to the agency, which said that it reviews applications individually. Insurance companies consider several factors when calculating auto premiums, including consumers\u2019 driving records, education, occupations, credit scores, ages and genders. They also consider ZIP codes, which take into account the prevalence of auto insurance fraud, costs of medical care and weather in the area. New York, California, Georgia, Hawaii and Massachusetts have banned insurance companies from considering consumers\u2019 education and occupations when setting auto policy rates, DeLong said. While the price of auto insurance is surging in New York, the number of insured vehicles is declining. Registration suspensions for uninsured vehicles increased by 25,959, or 7%, to 406,051 statewide between 2022 and 2024, according to the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles. The number of tickets that police wrote to drivers operating uninsured vehicles in the state grew by 5,711, or 9%, to 70,733 between 2022 and 2023, according to the DMV. The 2024 ticket data is not available yet. But the number is expected to be a few thousand higher than the amount in 2023, the agency said. The DMV cannot definitively attribute the increase in registration suspensions and tickets for uninsured vehicles to the rising costs of auto insurance, according to the agency. The rate of uninsured driving is increasing in some states by as much as 30%, said Shannon Martin, insurance analyst at Bankrate, a Manhattan-based consumer financial services company. But driving without insurance is a risk that should be avoided. \u201cAllowing car insurance to lapse due to non-payment can trigger a range of issues, including state fines and higher insurance rates when the policy is reissued,\u201d Martin said. Instead of dropping insurance, drivers should discuss with their insurers removing unnecessary coverage, or consider switching to a usage-based insurance policy, she said. Stony Brook resident Lee Chaconas, 67, was able to apply discounts to her Geico policy for her 2019 Honda Accord, she said. A retired Geico personal-injury claims adjuster, Chaconas pays $789 for a six-month premium with a 10% discount because she is a member of the insurer\u2019s credit union and an additional 10% discount for taking a defensive driving course every three years, she said. But with her premium increasing $20 to $30 annually, \u201cwhich adds up,\u201d she doesn\u2019t plan to ever buy another car if she can help it. \u201cThey\u2019re going to bury me in that car,\u201d she said. Insurance companies experienced big profit losses in 2022, as steep inflation drove up the costs of repairs, labor and used cars. They have raised rates in the past few years to try to offset those losses. \u201cInsurance companies now are running to the bank with record profits,\" said Aaron J. Stein, president of Norton & Siegel Inc., an insurance agency in Babylon. \"They\u2019re trying to make up for the years they lost, but at some point \u2026 this is a problem.\u201d Geico\u2019s underwriting profit in the third quarter of 2024 was $2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. In the third quarter of 2024, Progressive\u2019s revenue grew 25% to $19.5 billion compared to the same period a year earlier. The company had 33.9 million active insurance policies, a 14% increase from the same period in 2023. In New York state, Geico, State Farm, Allstate and Progressive accounted for 70.87% of the market share for auto insurers in 2023, according to a report from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Among the insurers with more than $100 million in written premiums in the state, State Farm had the biggest auto insurance rate increase for renewing customers last year, an average of 24.9%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, a Manhattan-based financial analysis provider. State Farm, New York's second-largest auto insurer, said it has experienced unprecedented growth in its car insurance business in the state. \u201cWhile it is a privilege to be chosen by so many New York drivers, it is important that our rates are adequate to support the business and that we\u2019re able to match price to risk,\u201d said Justin Tomczak, a spokesman for the Bloomington, Illinois-based company. Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Co. had the second-largest car insurance rate increase in New York last year, averaging 18.7%, according to S&P. The insurer did not respond to requests for comment. Progressive, which averaged increases of 19.7% in 2023 and 4.6% in 2024, also did not respond. Geico is New York state's largest auto insurer, holding 28.37% of the market share in 2023, according to NAIC. Geico had an average New York car insurance rate hike of 7% in March 2024 and a 10% increase in August 2023, according to S&P. Newsday asked Geico about the premiums it charges in the state and why it has increased them. The Chevy Chase, Maryland-based company forwarded the inquiry to the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, which responded by email: \u201cAcross the country, auto insurance premiums have been on the rise for the simple reason that the cost of things that auto insurance pays for has been rising,\" said Kristina Baldwin, vice president in state government relations at the Washington, D.C.-based association. \"The cost of medical care for accident victims continues to increase as well as the cost of the parts and labor to repair vehicles.\u201d She also cited riskier behavior, including distracted and impairing driving, as factors that are increasing injury and collision claim costs and compounding the effects of inflation. Between 2019 and 2023, car crashes in the state fell 18% to 418,687, but fatal crashes rose 16% to 1,022, according to the Institute for Traffic Safety Management & Research. On Long Island, crashes dropped 5% to 77,547, while fatal crashes grew by nearly a fifth, reaching over 200 annually. Insurance rate increases are expected to continue in 2025 across Long Island, New York and the nation, but will likely proceed more modestly than in the past two years as inflationary pressure eases on the cost of repairing and replacing damaged vehicles, said Tim Zawacki, insurance sector strategist at S&P. The second half of the year should bode better for consumers, he said. \u201cAssuming no unexpected economic events, we would expect price competition to pick up across markets,\" he said. \"And we\u2019re already seeing carriers spend significantly more money on advertising seeking to attract new customers.\"\n\nClaudia Schimmel and her husband felt sticker shock when they received their car insurance renewal notice last fall.\n\nThe six-month premium to insure the Lindenhurst couple\u2019s 2023 Volkswagen SUV and 2019 Ram pickup truck with Geico increased in November by about $500, or 30%, to $2,223, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to shift a few things around, definitely,\" said Schimmel, 31, the mother of a 2-year-old boy. \"The excess spending on toys and things like that definitely goes down.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband plan to shop around for cheaper insurance, she said.\n\nThey're not alone.

The Chevy Chase, Maryland-based company forwarded the inquiry to the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, which responded by email:\n\n\u201cAcross the country, auto insurance premiums have been on the rise for the simple reason that the cost of things that auto insurance pays for has been rising,\" said Kristina Baldwin, vice president in state government relations at the Washington, D.C.-based association. \"The cost of medical care for accident victims continues to increase as well as the cost of the parts and labor to repair vehicles.\u201d\n\nShe also cited riskier behavior, including distracted and impairing driving, as factors that are increasing injury and collision claim costs and compounding the effects of inflation.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, car crashes in the state fell 18% to 418,687, but fatal crashes rose 16% to 1,022, according to the Institute for Traffic Safety Management & Research. On Long Island, crashes dropped 5% to 77,547, while fatal crashes grew by nearly a fifth, reaching over 200 annually.\n\nInsurance rate increases are expected to continue in 2025 across Long Island, New York and the nation, but will likely proceed more modestly than in the past two years as inflationary pressure eases on the cost of repairing and replacing damaged vehicles, said Tim Zawacki, insurance sector strategist at S&P.\n\nThe second half of the year should bode better for consumers, he said.\n\n\u201cAssuming no unexpected economic events, we would expect price competition to pick up across markets,\" he said. \"And we\u2019re already seeing carriers spend significantly more money on advertising seeking to attract new customers.\""

            "article_content": "A review of personal exchanges and personal communications sheds new light on the collaboration between both researchers, which would lay the foundations for groundbreaking discoveries in particle physics\n\nSamuel Jarman, SciencePOD\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) made its groundbreaking discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012, but its ancestry can be traced back over 60 years to the first electron-positron collision experiment in Italy. Named Anello di Accumulazione (AdA), the experiment was the world\u2019s first collider of matter and antimatter.\n\nThrough new research published in +, Luisa Bonolis, a historian of physics from MPIWG in Berlin, together with particle physicists Franco Buccella from INFN Roma1 and Giulia Pancheri at INFN Frascati Laboratories, tell the little-known story how AdA\u2019s theoretical foundations were shaped by the collaboration between Bruno Touschek and Raoul Gatto: two pioneering physicists with a deep knowledge of the properties of fundamental particles.\n\nBuilt at Frascati in 1961, AdA was a ring-shaped collider around 1.3 metres in diameter, which operated until 1964. Despite its short lifetime, the experiment lay vital groundwork for ADONE: an electron-positron collider 105 metres in diameter, which would go on to operate until 1993.\n\nThis larger collider helped to refine the methods, which in 1974, would lead to the groundbreaking discovery of the J/psi meson. This particle was crucial in advancing our understanding of quarks and their interactions \u2013 ultimately paving the way for the discovery of the Higgs boson several decades later.\n\nTouschek is well known for his contributions to the AdA experiment, but less is known about the crucial role played by his friend, Gatto, who he met in Rome in 1953. In their paper, the team investigate the collaboration between the pair based on a wide range of available sources: including Gatto\u2019s personal exchanges with Touschek, and their own private communications with Gatto.\n\nThe team\u2019s findings highlight the close friendship between the two scientists, and paint a picture of the discussions between them which would prove the feasibility of collider rings as tools for probing the world of elementary particles.\n\nThe paper also explores the duo\u2019s friendship with Wolfgang Pauli and Gerhard L\u00fcders, whose theoretical work was a vital basis for AdA\u2019s success, and highlights Touschek and Gatto\u2019s contribution in mentoring many of the great Italian physicists whose work would shape the foundations of the Standard Model.\n\nReference\n\nL Bonolis, F Buccella, G Pancheri.

China has been making agile policies that allow fast proof of concept, [as well as] failure and retry, which facilitates really quick iterations,\u201d said Ann Shi Yu, vice-president of autonomous driving company Pony.ai.\n\n\u201cThe competition in China is fiercer, which forces [companies] to progress,\u201d Shi said, noting that in the US only Alphabet-backed Waymo is capable of operating hundreds of fully autonomous robotaxis on public roads. In China, there is \u201cdefinitely more than one company doing that\u201d.\n\nPony.ai was operating around 250 robotaxis and roughly 190 robotrucks as of the end of 2024, according to Shi. Domestic rivals have also achieved a fleet size in the hundreds, including Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go which operates more than 400 robotaxis in Wuhan, Hubei province.\n\nThe panel discussion on AI at the Post\u2019s China Conference in Nansha on Wednesday. Photo: Nora Tam\n\nIn the field of robotics, UBTech\u2019s chief brand officer Michael Tam said that US competitors, including Tesla and OpenAI, \u201care a little bit advanced\u201d in terms of developing the \u201cbrain\u201d of robots, which is the artificial intelligence (AI) technology that controls a robot\u2019s sensors and movements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the recent rise of Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek, which trained its large language model with fewer resources but ended up with one that matched or even exceeded in certain areas the performance of larger US competitors such as OpenAI and Facebook parent Meta Platforms, proved that \u201cthere\u2019s not so much [of a] gap between the US and mainland China\u201d for AI, Tam said."

Image: Adobe Stock\n\nWhile the definitive diagnosis of iRBD requires in-laboratory video polysomnography, which can be both costly and challenging to interpret, a recent study used a 3D time-of-flight camera in a sleep laboratory with high accuracy, the researchers wrote.\n\nIn this study, During and colleagues sought to replicate and expand on those results utilizing a conventional 2D camera to monitor patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep difficulties and create a machine-learning analysis method, to replicate prior research attempted with a 3D lens in track sleep-related movements.\n\nTheir study featured 172 participants \u2014 81 with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls \u2014 evaluated between 2016 and 2022 at Stanford Sleep Center. The control group included 28 healthy sleepers and 63 individuals with other sleep disorders, who were matched to iRBD patients by age and sex.\n\nAll video-EEG polysomnography recordings were made with a 2D camera, shooting at 30 frames per second and were manually scored by two blinded sleep experts. A blinded sleep specialist also reviewed all recordings of iRBD patients to determine which individuals had visible movements in REM sleep.\n\nThe researchers then used an optical flow computer vision algorithm to analyze these recordings and extract features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility.\n\nAfter review, it was determined that the control group was comprised of 28 healthy individuals and 63 with a sleep disorder. Within the iRBD group, 11 individuals did not have visible movements during REM sleep.\n\nAccording to results, individuals with iRBD demonstrated an increased amount of movements (56.3 vs. 41.8 per hour; average movement duration, 3.4 vs. 4.2 seconds) and immobility periods, compared with controls.\n\nThe accuracy for distinguishing iRBD from other sleep disorders ranged from 84.9% to 87.2%, with the highest accuracy (91.9%) achieved when combining all five movement features and analyzing only short movements. Of 11 patients with iRBD without visible movements during REM sleep, seven were correctly identified.\n\n\u201cThis automated approach could be integrated into clinical workflow during the interpretation of sleep tests to enhance and facilitate diagnosis, and avoid missed diagnoses,\u201d During said in a related Mount Sinai press release. \u201cThis method could also be used to inform treatment decisions based on the severity of movements displayed during the sleep tests and, ultimately, help doctors personalize care plans for individual patients.\u201d\n\nReference:"

Books ask questions that open new horizons, new pathways. They bring us laughter and tears, companionship and hope.\u201d Fifty schools in the UK will be matched with 50 schools in Ukraine on a year-long reading project targeted at children aged 7 to 14, and delivered by the British Council in partnership with the UK\u2019s National Literacy Trust. The schools will be chosen from across the four nations of the UK before the scheme launches in late spring this year. Starmer said:\n\nThe resilience of the Ukrainian people is incredible. I\u2019ve seen first-hand how learning and reading helps maintain a sense of normality for Ukraine\u2019s children and young people, who have faced unimaginable adversity as they live, learn and play under bombardment.\n\nShare\n\n54m ago 09.47 EST From today, Ukrainians who have lost close relatives during Russia\u2019s invasion will be able to lodge claims via a mechanism that has already received thousands of requests for compensation for damages. The Register of Damages for Ukraine opened in The Hague in April last year and is designed to function as a record of all eligible claims seeking reparation for the damage, loss and injury following the launch of Russia\u2019s attack in February 2022. \u201cStarting today, family members who lost a close relative due to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine may seek compensation for their own mental pain and anguish by submitting a claim,\u201d the Register said. \u201cThis marks a significant step forward in addressing the immense personal suffering caused by Russia\u2019s aggression, providing a pathway for families to seek justice and recognition for their profound loss,\u201d it said in a statement, reported by Agence France-Presse. Created by the Council of Europe and joined by the European Union, the Register will ultimately work out a financial total with a view toward extracting reparations from Moscow. Last year it opened a category to claim for damages and destruction of property and which has now been expanded to include parents, spouses, civil partners and children of individuals who died as a result of the invasion. So far, some 13,000 claims amounting to more than \u20ac800m have been received, in the initial category, the Register said.

But the agreement could mark a first step toward ending a 15-month war that has destroyed Gaza and divided Israelis.\n\nThe truce, mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, would begin on Sunday and cover an initial period of 42 days.\n\nPalestinians in Khan Younis celebrated the announcement of a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. (Video: Reuters)\n\n\u201cThis is one of the toughest negotiations I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d President Joe Biden said Wednesday in remarks from the White House. \u201cAnd I\u2019m deeply satisfied this day has come \u2026 for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony, and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war.\u201d\n\nUnder the first six-week phase of what mediators hope will evolve into a three-stage process for peace, 33 of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza \u2014 mainly women, children, the elderly and wounded \u2014 will be released from Hamas captivity in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli detention, in a carefully choreographed sequence that will involve humanitarian groups and coordination between Hamas, Egypt and Israel.\n\nAmong the 33 captives slated for release are Americans Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen, said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDekel-Chen was wounded in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and Siegel, 65, will be freed because of his age. A third U.S. citizen, Edan Alexander, was abducted near Gaza while serving in the Israeli military and won\u2019t be released until the second phase of the ceasefire.\n\nHamas agreed to release five female Israeli soldiers in the first phase. The remains of at least four more Americans are also still in Gaza. \u201cWe are committed to getting the remains out,\u201d the official said.\n\nIsrael and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal on Jan. 15, following more than 15 months of devastating war. (Video: Joe Snell/The Washington Post)\n\nIsrael will withdraw troops from some parts of Gaza and allow a surge of humanitarian aid into the enclave, where 90 percent of the population, or 1.9 million people, are displaced in squalid conditions with little food, water or shelter from the cold.\n\nDuring the first phase, the volume of aid entering Gaza is supposed to reach more than 500 trucks per day, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday \u2014 a more than sixfold increase over the average number in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even once the bombs stop falling, steep challenges will remain in getting lifesaving assistance to civilians who need it, including abiding lawlessness in Gaza, destroyed roads and onerous Israeli inspection processes for cargoes entering the territory, aid workers say.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment of hope and opportunity, but we should be under no illusions how tough it will still be to get support to survivors,\u201d U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher said in a statement. \u201cThe stakes could not be higher.\u201d\n\nMohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar\u2019s prime minister and foreign affairs minister, spoke on Jan. 15, as Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire. (Video: Reuters)\n\nIsraeli forces will remain in a buffer zone along Gaza\u2019s borders, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in a news conference in Doha, where negotiators spent the last few days hammering out the deal. After a week, if the truce holds, Palestinian civilians sheltering in southern and central Gaza will be allowed to return to the north, which in recent months has been decimated by intense Israeli bombardment and clashes with Hamas militants.\n\nSince October, Israeli forces have besieged the northernmost part of the enclave, blocking most aid and forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. Israel divided the territory into a north and south with a line of fortified checkpoints known as the Netzarim Corridor just outside Gaza City, only occasionally allowing humanitarians to cross into northern areas.\n\nNegotiations for Phase 2 of the deal \u2014 during which the remaining living hostages would be released and Israel would withdraw completely from Gaza \u2014 are supposed to begin in the coming weeks. During Phase 3, Hamas would return the bodies of hostages who were killed and the reconstruction of Gaza would get underway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deal has offered a glimmer of hope in a conflict that has taken an immense human toll: Israeli attacks have killed more than 46,700 people in Gaza and injured more than 110,200, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 405 soldiers have been killed in its military operation in Gaza.\n\nA war that began with Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel spiraled into a regional conflagration, marked by more than a year of exchanges of fire between Israel and its allies and Iran-aligned groups in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria.\n\nThere was still much that could go wrong during the deal\u2019s implementation, and Israeli officials have emphasized that so far, it is a temporary pause. The thorniest questions \u2014 including who will govern and secure Gaza \u2014 remain unresolved, and negotiations over these and other issues are expected to begin later in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael\u2019s bombardment of Gaza hasn\u2019t let up: At least 19 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes across the territory on Wednesday night after the ceasefire was announced.\n\nStill, even before mediator Qatar declared that a deal was reached, celebrations broke out in Gaza and among hostage families and supporters in Tel Aviv.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office issued a statement shortly after the announcement insisting that some details still needed to be worked out. But President-elect Donald Trump had already blasted out the news to the world, writing on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cWE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!\u201d\n\nLate Wednesday night, the parties were still arguing over the names of high-profile prisoners to be released under the agreement, according to an official familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s cabinet and members of his coalition government must vote on Thursday morning to approve the deal. His far-right allies in government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, both slammed the agreement as a bad deal that spares Hamas and threatened to withdraw from Netanyahu\u2019s government.\n\nStill, the prime minister is widely expected to have enough votes to push through the agreement, and Israel\u2019s Supreme Court is expected to dismiss possible legal challenges to the deal.\n\n\u201cThis is an important move. This is a necessary move,\u201d Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in televised remarks Wednesday night, urging the government to make the ceasefire official. \u201cThere is no greater moral, human, Jewish, or Israeli obligation than to bring our sons and daughters back to us \u2014 whether to recover at home, or to be laid to rest.\u201d\n\nLeaders from mediating countries appeared to dismiss the procedural steps in Israel as mere formalities. Qatar\u2019s Mohammed, Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi each declared victory after months of stop-and-start negotiations that repeatedly saw negotiators and intelligence chiefs huddle in Middle Eastern capitals, only to return home empty-handed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cToo many innocent people have died. Too many communities have been destroyed.\u201d\n\nThe mediators, at least for now, overcame the herculean task of reconciling the diametrically opposed positions of Israel and Hamas. Israel wanted to continue the fighting after a temporary pause and hostage-for-prisoner exchange, while Hamas insisted on a permanent end to the war before it would surrender any captives.\n\nBut pressure on both parties pushed them to close the gap. Netanyahu was under fire from hostage families and those who lost loved ones in the war. He was also in potential legal peril abroad, after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas was severely weakened after Israel killed its top leaders and kneecapped regional allies. Residents grew increasingly angry as they struggled to survive the punishing campaign Israel launched in response to the Hamas attacks.\n\nIn the end, the deal agreed to Wednesday aligns to a large extent with the phased approach Biden proposed in May: An initial pause in hostilities and release of hostages is intended to lead to \u201csustainable calm,\u201d according to a joint statement by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. Those three countries are meant to serve as guarantors of the deal, and Mohammed said a monitoring body would be established in Cairo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden and Trump each claimed credit for a diplomatic achievement closed through rare foreign-policy collaboration between the outgoing and incoming administrations. As Biden officials carried out the formal diplomacy, Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, met with Netanyahu over the weekend to pressure the Israeli prime minister to agree to a deal before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\n\u201cThis EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nBiden said \u201cthis deal was developed and negotiated under my administration\u201d but that his officials had been speaking \u201cas one team\u201d with their soon-to-be successors in recent days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHamas leader Khalil al-Hayya hailed the ceasefire as a triumph for the militant group: \u201cToday we prove that the occupation will never defeat our people and their resistance,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHospitals in Israel are preparing to receive hostages who may be malnourished, injured or ill \u2014 and will certainly be traumatized, Israeli media reported.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, where thousands have gathered for months each Saturday night to protest the government\u2019s failure to bring all of the hostages home sooner, crowds beat drums and chanted.\n\n\u201cI hope it will not just be a ceasefire but a stop to the war,\u201d said Benjamin Terem, 65, from Tel Aviv. \u201cWe cannot stay in this situation.\u201d\n\nIn Gaza, 20-year-old Farah Hathout said she was displaced nine times throughout the war. She woke up where she is sheltering in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, to check the news.\n\n\u201cIs it real? Have they signed?\u201d she said she asked herself.\n\n\u201cI pray it goes through,\u201d said Hathout, who was in tears. \u201cMay God compensate us for what we experienced.\u201d\n\nDeYoung reported from Washington, Shih from Jerusalem, Balousha from Toronto and Mahfouz from Cairo.

In 2023, Tesla's share stood at 19 percent before dropping to 18 percent in first nine months of 2024, according to analyses by EV Volumes published on CleanTechnica.\n\nThe competition is now hot on Tesla's heels. As Statista's Florian Zandt shows in the chart below, the Chinese conglomerate BYD, which produces standalone electric vehicle batteries and associated electronics in addition to plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, increased its market share by 9 percentage points between 2021 and 2024.\n\nInfographic: Tesla and BYD Claim a Third of the Global BEV Market | Statista\n\nYou will find more infographics at Statista\n\nAs CleanTechnica points out, BYD's market share in the BEV market might not increase that much in 2025 due to the manufacturer focusing on plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in the upcoming year.\n\nThe BEV portfolio of legacy automakers like Volkswagen and Geely-Volvo stood at 7 and 8 percent, respectively, while SAIC, which includes the joint venture between the Chinese state-owned SAIC Motor and Wuling as well as General Motors, also had a market share of 8 percent as of the most recently available data.\n\nBetween 2023 and January to September 2024, BYD's and Tesla's shares dropped by 1 percentage point each. BYD is focused on providing BEVs to a more general consumer base, while Tesla's products have a higher price tag. This difference might be slightly mitigated through the increase of tariffs on Chinese-made cars from 25 to 100 percent which came into effect in August 2024.\n\nAccording to EV Volumes, 14 million electric vehicles were sold globally in 2023, 70 percent of which were BEVs. However, 84 percent of all light vehicles sold still ran on traditional combustion engines or other non-electric fuel sources. The biggest exporter and market for both hybrids and BEVs was China with shares of 65 and 59 percent, respectively.\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com"

The Los Angeles conflagration is more akin to a storm that hits a major coastal city, like Houston or New Orleans, causing major disruption for millions of people and businesses.\n\n\u201cIt looks a lot more like the humanitarian situation from a flood or a hurricane than a wildfire that people are watching in the hills,\u201d said Amir Jina, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s Harris School of Public Policy, who has studied the economic impact of climate change."

            "article_content": "Tesla certainly isn\u2019t running out of steam when it comes to new ideas, with promises of the Optimus Robot and self-driving cars in the next few years. Despite the grand plans, I err on the side of caution for one main reason: its divisive boss, Elon Musk.\n\nMusk has dominated UK headlines recently thanks to his plotting to oust Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the rumours that he may donate millions to Reform UK at the next general election \u2013 although his rift with Nigel Farage may have dampened such a move.\n\nRegardless of your politics, as an investor, it\u2019s cause for concern for a few reasons.\n\nFirstly, there is the simple question of how Musk can do it all. He is running Tesla, running his space technology company, SpaceX, running the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), is set to co-chair the new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration \u2013 and now, he\u2019s dabbling in European politics, too. How does he have the time?\n\nOne rather funny theory about his latest obsession with the UK and Europe is that he wakes up very early in the morning and spends time on \u201cX\u201d. There\u2019s no US news at that time, so he\u2019s simply getting worked up about what is in front of him \u2013 I imagine it\u2019s a little more thought-through, however.\n\nThen there is the more serious worry about his general suitability as chief executive from an investor\u2019s perspective.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the history. In 2018, he tweeted that he had the funding to take Tesla private at $420 (\u00a3342) a share (a substantial premium on the share price at the time), and that the move hung on a shareholder vote.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission said the tweet was misleading and caused Tesla\u2019s share price to jump 6pc \u2013 so he was fined. In 2020, he posted that, in his opinion, Tesla was overpriced and the share price fell about 10pc.\n\nI\u2019d rather the chief executive of a company didn\u2019t mess with the value of my investment through social media so brazenly.\n\nThis erratic behaviour isn\u2019t isolated to tweets about Tesla. In late December, he hosted Nigel Farage at his current residence on Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort. By early January, he was calling for Reform UK to find a new leader."

            "article_content": "Coined in 2010 by Forrester Research, the term \"zero trust\" has long been hijacked by security vendors eager to take advantage of the hype that surrounds the concept. Today, it's so overused and misused that many see it as a meaningless buzzword\u2014but that's far from the truth. In fact, its widespread misappropriation demonstrates the power of zero trust security. Why else would countless vendors try to capitalize on it? As they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\n\nZero trust is not a mere label. Rather, zero trust is an architecture\u2014though you'll also hear of a zero trust methodology, framework, paradigm, and infrastructure\u2014and it's based on the idea of zero implicit trust, meaning no one should be trusted by default. The key zero trust principle of least-privileged access says a user should be given access only to a specific IT resource the user is authorized to access, at the moment that user needs it, and nothing more. Hence the zero trust maxim, \"never trust, always verify.\"\n\nAs a networking and security strategy, zero trust stands in stark contrast to traditional, network-centric, perimeter-based architectures built with firewalls and VPNs, which involve excessive permissions and increase cyber risk. To learn about their weaknesses in more detail, you can read this ebook.\n\nThe main point is this: you cannot do zero trust with firewall- and VPN-centric architectures. Those approaches were not designed for today's world or its sophisticated cyberthreats, and that is why zero trust is now key for cybersecurity.\n\nSo, what sets zero trust apart and makes it a good fit for modern organizations?\n\nKey aspects of zero trust\n\nNot all segmentation is equal\n\nLateral movement is a step in the attack chain that occurs when a threat makes it past an organization's defenses and onto the network, where it moves across connected apps and expands the reach of the breach. This is an inherent weakness of perimeter-based architectures, which connect users to the network as a whole, giving them wide access to the resources therein.\n\nThe solutions to this problem are often assumed to be network segmentation and microsegmentation, whereby the network and its contents are split into smaller segments that are separated by (fire)walls. But this strategy is complex and expensive to set up and maintain, and tries to lessen a symptom of yesterday's architectures without solving the underlying problems: the architectures themselves.\n\nThe actual solution is zero trust segmentation. A zero trust architecture connects users directly to authorized apps in a one-to-one fashion\u2014nobody receives access to the network as a whole. As a result, the potential for lateral threat movement is eliminated, along with complexity and cost.\n\nSecure any entity accessing any resource\n\nPlenty of people hear \"zero trust\" and assume it's the same as zero trust network access (ZTNA). But ZTNA is a specific solution, not an architecture. What ZTNA does, despite its inaccurate naming convention, is provide users with zero trust access directly to private apps hosted in data centers and private clouds\u2014it does not give access to the network.\n\nZTNA is certainly a key part of any platform providing zero trust architecture, but it is not the whole story. Users access more than private applications alone. They also access the web, SaaS apps, and other IT resources across a variety of environments.\n\nBeyond that, it's not just users that need secure access. There are also workloads, IoT and OT devices, and B2B partners that regularly connect to IT resources. As such, having a complete zero trust architecture means securing any of these entities as they access any IT resource. This is why one will often hear the analogy of an intelligent switchboard that provides secure any-to-any connectivity in a one-to-one fashion.\n\nContext, context, context\n\nFrom the moment we are handed our first devices, we are conditioned to see identity authentication as the standard for cybersecurity. That typically carries through to conversations about identity and access management (IAM), where verifying user identity is seen as the ideal means of determining whether someone should be granted access to a resource. But identity alone is not enough\u2014even if it involves consideration of user group.\n\nThere are two reasons for this. First, users' identities can be stolen, as evinced by countless breaches involving the theft of VPN credentials. Second, users who are who they say they are can still engage in malicious or careless behavior that exposes organizations to cyberattacks and data loss.\n\nInstead of sticking to this risky status quo, zero trust uses context to assess risk and govern access. That does include identity (which is a core part of zero trust architecture), but it goes far beyond it to consider other variables like device posture, destination and content risk, user behavior, and more. As an added point, this contextual analysis typically requires a heavy dose of AI/ML.\n\nCyberthreat and data protection\n\nZero trust architecture stops cyberattacks in four key ways (some of which we've already mentioned):\n\nZero trust eliminates firewalls, VPNs, and their public IP addresses, which are attractive targets for cyberattackers. Instead, apps are hidden behind a zero trust cloud, eliminating the attack surface. In other words, inbound connections are replaced with inside-out connections. Zero trust prevents compromise through context-aware policies and, unlike hardware and virtual appliances, a high-performance cloud with the scalability necessary to inspect encrypted traffic (where most threats hide (but more on that below (aren't parentheses fun?))). Zero trust gives direct-to-app connectivity rather than network access, preventing the potential for lateral movement across resources. Zero trust stops data loss by, once again, inspecting encrypted traffic (where most data loss occurs), and protecting all modern data leakage paths, including SaaS app sharing, removable storage on endpoints, and a lot more.\n\nIn addition to the above, a fully featured zero trust platform should provide cyberthreat protection functionality like cloud sandboxing, DNS security, browser isolation, and more. Similarly, it should provide data protection capabilities like SSPM, out-of-band CASB, EDM, and more.\n\nSpecial delivery!\n\nTo dive a bit deeper into something alluded to above, zero trust is a cloud native architecture. That is, it cannot be achieved merely by deploying another appliance in a data center or private cloud. Rather, it is delivered as a service from a global, multitenant cloud that was built for the purpose of providing zero trust architecture at the edge, meaning as close to end users as possible.\n\nBecause this omnipresent cloud provides secure any-to-any connectivity along with all the security functions anyone could ask for, it's a perfect fit for modern organizations with widely distributed cloud resources, remote workers, and data. These organizations no longer have to backhaul traffic to their data centers or maintain the same complex, inbound and outbound stacks of security and networking appliances (whether hardware or virtual).\n\nAdditionally, unlike appliances, cloud scale means that zero trust has the performance necessary to inspect encrypted traffic. With nearly all web traffic now encrypted and 87% of cyberattacks hiding in encrypted traffic, this inspection is more important than ever.\n\nZero trust benefits\n\nReduced risk\n\nThe first and most obvious benefit of a zero trust architecture is that it systematically reduces cyber risk. Delivering zero trust segmentation from the cloud, securing every stage of the attack chain, providing comprehensive data and threat protection, and enforcing context- and risk-based policies for every entity accessing any resource ensures airtight defense.\n\nSuperior productivity\n\nWith zero trust, you can eliminate VPNs and stop backhauling traffic. Instead, you get direct-to-app connectivity through a global cloud with the scalability necessary to handle the traffic surges that appliances cannot. Adding built-in digital experience monitoring (DEM) to the equation further enhances the user experience benefits. The result is more user productivity, and with fewer tickets and managerial headaches for admins, help desk and networking productivity is enhanced, as well.\n\nReduced cost and complexity\n\nZero trust eliminates six significant costs of perimeter-based architectures because it:\n\nRemoves the need to buy a myriad of security and networking point products Reduces operational complexity and administrative burden Accelerates IT integration during M&A Minimizes the risk and, as a result, the cost of data breaches Enhances productivity, as mentioned above Reduces power consumption and carbon footprint\n\nDigital transformation\n\nBy transforming security and connectivity with zero trust, organizations the world over can embrace digital transformation both securely and effectively. Rather than force-fitting yesterday's approach to security and networking onto the modern workplace, organizations can leverage zero trust architecture and seamlessly take advantage of cloud apps, remote work, and whatever else the digital future may hold.\n\nWhere to start?\n\nIf you're looking to embrace a comprehensive zero-trust architecture that checks all the boxes and unlocks all the benefits described in this blog, there is only one choice: Zscaler, the original pioneer and continued innovator of zero trust.\n\nThe Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange platform is the world's largest inline security cloud. It comprises more than 160 data centers globally, processes over 500B transactions daily, secures more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies, and boasts a Net Promoter Score of more than 70 (while the SaaS average is less than 30). Zscaler has the proven scale and expertise necessary to help any organization successfully implement zero trust.\n\nIf you want to get started on your zero trust journey but aren't sure where to begin, register for our monthly live webinar, Zero Trust 101: Start Your Journey Here.

And it\u2019s from this warrior spirit that the link to Tigres Femenil comes in, with the fans christening the team as \"Amazons\" for their character, dedication, passion, hard work, respect and courage to fight for themselves and for all those around them, key characteristics they share with Diana Prince (Wonder Woman).\n\nThe jersey design draws inspiration from Wonder Woman, seamlessly merging Tigres Femenil's fierce identity with the iconic superhero's strength. Its vibrant purple and green palette is accented by stars, the DC Comics logo, and the phrase \u201cAmazons United,\u201d a nod to the team\u2019s unity and resilience.\n\nThe collection extends beyond the pitch, featuring a complementary beige jacket and sweatshirt with gold detailing, delivering a sophisticated edge for fans and players alike."

I definitely understand quant investing, including factors and what not (AI before it was called AI). But I don't agree with what other quants do. Rather than be obsessed with statistical studies that are no good for any time periods other than the ones studied, I combine factor work with the underlying theories of finance including classic fundamental analysis to get the true story of a company and its stock. Investing is about the future. So numbers (which necessarily live in the past) can take us just so far. They\u2019re at their best when they cue us into stories that shed light on what\u2019s likely to happen in the future. And that\u2019s how I use them,I\u2019ve had a pretty colorful career. Besides a full range of experience covering stocks from lots of different groups (large cap, small cap, micro cap, value, growth, income, special situations \u2026 you name it, I covered it) I\u2019ve developed and worked with many different quant models. In addition, I formerly managed a high-yield fixed-income (\u201cjunk bond\u201d) fund and conducted research involving quantitative asset allocation strategies such as are at the foundation of what today has come to be known as Robo Advising. I formerly edited and or wrote several stock newsletters, the most noteworthy having been the Forbes Low Priced Stock Report. I previously served as an assistant research director at Value Line.I also have long had a passion for investor education, which has resulted in my having conducted numerous seminars on stock selection and analysis, and the authoring of two books: Screening The Market and The Value Connection.I\u2019m looking forward to my new incarnation on Seeking Alpha. I hope you enjoy what I offer. But if you don\u2019t, feel free to tell me why in the comment sections. I\u2019m a big boy. I can handle criticism. (But please don\u2019t call me \u201cstupid.\u201d That\u2019s my wife\u2019s job!)"

            "article_content": "Scientists have used the famed \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment to come up with a way to remove errors from future quantum computers .\n\nThe new method encodes quantum information onto an antimony atom, which has eight possible states that enable data to be more safely stored than in a standard two-state qubit, or quantum bit.\n\nThe breakthrough is a vital step in making errors within quantum systems less likely to occur, and, when they do, make them more easily detected and corrected \u2014 a key barrier to the development of quantum computers . The researchers published their findings Wednesday (Jan.14) in the journal Nature Physics .\n\nFirst devised by physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in 1925, his thought experiment evocatively describes the weird rules of the quantum world by imagining a cat placed inside an opaque box with a poison vial which has an opening mechanism controlled by radioactive decay \u2014 a completely random quantum process.\n\nRelated: Quantum computers that are actually useful 1 step closer thanks to new silicon processor that could pack millions of qubits\n\nUntil the box is opened and the cat is observed, Schr\u00f6dinger argued, the rules of quantum mechanics mean that the unfortunate feline will exist in a superposition of states, simultaneously dead and alive.\n\nIn the case of a qubit, quantum information relating to the 0 or 1 states of a classical computer can be encoded on the \"'spin up\"' and \"'spin down\"' states of an atom \u2014 spin being the intrinsic angular momentum of a fundamental particle.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The six additional spin directions of the antimony atom (obtained by the atom\u2019s composite nature that adds multiple individual spins) means that, unlike in a two spin-state system, a single error isn't enough to destroy the encoded information.\n\n\"As the proverb goes, a cat has nine lives. One little scratch is not enough to kill it,\" co-author Benjamin Wilhelm , a doctoral student in electrical engineering and telecommunications at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, said in a statement . \"Our metaphorical 'cat' has seven lives: it would take seven consecutive errors to turn the '0' into a '1'!\"\n\nWith this system in place, the researchers say they will now work to demonstrate a method for detecting and correcting errors in their chip, a feat that is considered a \"Holy Grail\" within the quantum computing field."

            "article_content": "\u201cL\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi\u201d is a phrase attributed to French king Louis XIV, the Sun King, though it is considered by historians to be apocryphal: meaning \u201cI am the state,\u201d it speaks to the king\u2019s absolute and divinely ordained power. Three kings ruled from the Palace of Versailles: Louis XIV until his death in 1715, then Louis XV from 1722 until 1774 and finally, Louis XVI until the Revolution of 1789. Louis XV was among the best-educated royals of his age, and his knowledge was of a mostly scientific nature. From the age of seven, he was passionate about cartography, and at age eleven, he discovered astronomy. \u201cIn addition to his core education, he touched upon anatomy and surgery, and from medicine, he went on to study botany. He read a great deal, assiduously consulted the maps in his geography gallery, attended dissections, studied plants at Trianon [a smaller building at Versailles] and observed the heavens, following every astronomical event,\u201d writes French art historian Beatrix Saule in the book that accompanies the London Science Museum\u2019s exhibition, \u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour.\u201d While Versailles and its kings have always been regarded as sumptuous and somewhat decadent against a backdrop of the then-starving French peasantry, the scientific pursuits of the kings are not at the top of public consciousness. Until, that is, this show was put together.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

I was surprised, therefore, that the revolution was mentioned only briefly in this exhibition: while it is written on plaques that scientific instruments were destroyed or stolen during the riots, it is not explained at length, nor is it explained fully as to whether the republic that followed adopted the scientific discoveries of their forebears. This, I feel, is a glaring omission, and one that will leave visitors wanting to know more: while the exhibition book mentions that \u201cdocuments and scientific instruments were scattered at the time of the revolutionary sales in 1793-94, when Versailles was emptied of all its furnishings\u201d and that objects were taken to various institutions, it does not feel thorough. True, the exhibition is entitled \u201cVersailles\u201d rather than \u201cFrance: Science and Splendour,\u201d but more background wouldn\u2019t be out of place.\n\nThe star of the show is Louis XV\u2019s rhino. The male Indian rhinoceros presented to Louis XV in 1769 by Jean-Baptiste Chevalier de Conan, the governor of Chandernagore (now Chandannagar) in Bengal, has pride of place in the exhibition\u2019s main room. The plaque reads that he was killed during the revolution, possibly drowning in the fountains or after being stabbed with a sword. While he lived, the rhinoceros was among thousands of animals from Europe, Asia, Africa and America in the royal menagerie. They were a source of inspiration for many artists, such as the Flemish animal painter Pieter Boel, whose studies included a painting of one of the rarest birds in the menagerie, the cassowary, sent to Versailles in 1671 from Madagascar.\n\nThe other star of the show is the Clock of the Creation of the World (the Pendule de la Cr\u00e9ation du monde). At the time of its manufacture\u20141754\u2014clocks were considered to be the most sophisticated and most prestigious devices ever made. Its design and mechanisms are a spectacle to behold: at the top, a shining sun banishes the darkness, which is represented in the form of clouds. It really is marvelous to look at: like jewelry, it gleams brilliantly in the light, and the meteorological forms are very stunningly depicted. \u201cIn the lower part, held in a patinated bronze rock surrounded by raging waves, sits a terrestrial globe engraved with the different countries. This globe rotates on its axis in 24 hours, and the inclination of the poles varies according to the seasons. A long ray of sun indicates midday in the countries situated on the same latitude,\u201d the exhibition book explains further.\n\nA portrait of Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet (1706\u20131749) is also included in the exhibition\u2014she who was deemed by her lover Voltaire to be \u201ca great man whose only fault was being a woman.\u201d While living with and supporting the writer financially, she accumulated a very large library, carried out scientific experiments and wrote a great number of books. One of the first to appear, in 1738, was El\u00e9mens de la philosophie de Neuton (translated colloquially, A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Newtonianism), which was thought to be by Voltaire but was, in fact, a collaborative effort. In addition to her literal translation of Newton\u2019s prose, du Ch\u00e2telet provided more accessible explanations of his arguments with clear examples: \u201cShe transformed his geometrical expositions into modern calculus, and also summarised the latest mathematical research and experimental vindications of his theories,\u201d says Versailles: Science and Splendour. I would have liked to have some space dedicated to the position of women in France at the time. Of the scientific community, how many were women? What level of education could a middle- or working-class woman attain? Sadly, this wider context is missing.\n\nThe construction of the magnificent fountains at Versailles, which still function gloriously today, is given space. The plans for the mechanisms and piping that would deliver the requisite 9,500 cubic meters of water , composed by \u201csavants and engineers,\u201d along with the taxidermied rhinoceros and the Clock of the Creation of the World, really give the exhibition its splendor. That said, if I had the chance to curate such a show, I would dedicate one of the galleries to a reproduction of a palace room of Versailles, complete with paneled walls, gilding and paintings. The objects in the exhibition, though fascinating, are rendered a little clinical in their austere Science Museum settings. Nevertheless, the show is a tremendous feat and sure to spark curiosity in those who make the time to visit.\n\n\u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour\u201d is at London\u2019s Science Museum through April 21, 2025."

            "article_content": "The 29th Traditional Beijing New Year Goods Fair opens to visitors at the National Agricultural Exhibition Center on Jan 3, 2025 attracting eager shoppers. LI ZHIMING/FOR CHINA DAILY\n\nMany famous people were born in the Year of the Snake. There's Polish astronomer and mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), a major figure in the \"scientific revolution\", who established that Earth revolved around the sun, not the other way around. Then there's the greatest of German literary figures, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832).\n\nBut let's talk about years, not people. One of the traditions of the Year of the Snake in China is transformation. There have been plenty of bad \"snake\" years. One is reminded of the Great Depression and the Wall Street Crash of (October) 1929. Another year I would like to mention is 2001. It was the year when the Sept 11 terrorist attacks on the United States took place. It was also the year when China joined the World Trade Organization \u2014 which helped expedite China's economic development and integrate its economy with the global economy.\n\nLooking back at the past year, two trends stand out for me. One is the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East. The region is seeing a genocide being committed by the Israeli state, witnessed in real time on TV screens across the world. And the US is complicit in this genocide, with its global standing going down drastically, even in parts of the West. On the other hand, apart from the West and a few US ally countries, China's standing has improved across the world, because it has stood with the ordinary people against the Israeli and American ruling elite.\n\nThe other development is the continuing rise of BRICS, along with China's rising economic status throughout the world. The year 2024 saw the addition of several major countries to BRICS, with Indonesia becoming the first country to join the grouping in the first days of 2025.\n\nThe rise of BRICS frightens the US elite, because it symbolizes the loss of their global economic dominance because of the decline of the US dollar as the principal international reserve currency. Although the decline of the dollar is an ongoing process, the year 2024 saw the acceleration of the process.\n\nSo what about 2025? I believe it will be a good year for China. Of course, we have to take into account Donald Trump's return to the White House after four years and his threat to impose high tariffs on imports from China, as well as other countries.\n\nIf Trump imposes punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, I believe he will cause more damage to the US than China. Looking at recent history, we can clearly see that the Chinese people's spirit of independence and self-reliance is very strong. They will not cave in under the pressure of punitive US tariffs.\n\nSelf-reliance is a major part of Chinese culture, which has influenced China's development. The other features include the emphasis on education and resolving problems harmoniously. Despite the bad periods in China's history, Chinese people's resilience, fighting spirit and industriousness have seen them through many a crisis. Three factors stand out in all this.\n\nThe first is the Chinese people's love for peace. Contrary to what the Western media say, I regard China as a peace-loving country. Unlike the US, which has been at war throughout its entire history, China avoids war. The century of humiliation taught it that a country is better off strong than weak. However, that does not mean it wants war.\n\nThe second factor is China's emphasis on reducing pollution and moving toward a sustainable, green economy. China's leadership of the green revolution over the last few years has been extremely impressive. The country is now the global leader in electric vehicles (EVs), and solar and wind energy. This is a remarkable achievement, and shows China is sensitive to the dangers that climate change poses to our world.\n\nSome Western countries have recently accused China of \"over-production\" of EVs, which are important to build a sustainable, green world in the future. However, the Western countries have targeted China because they are afraid that they will lose their market share of vehicles to China. But their attitude is mean considering how important EVs are to sustainable living. More importantly, these countries don't mind dominating markets through \"over-production\" when it suits them.\n\nThe third factor is China's technological advancement. China's scientific prowess before the \"scientific revolution\" beginning in the 16th century was unsurpassed in the world. But after that, China failed to advance like the West. But those days are over, with China catching up with the West in terms of technology and in some ways even eclipsing the West.\n\nIn space research, China has moved ahead so fast that it became the first country to bring lunar rock samples from the far side of the moon. And despite Western attempts to hold it back, Huawei remains a global leader in innovative telecommunications.\n\nChina is a global leader also in artificial intelligence. Despite the controversy over the rapid development of AI and its implications on human society, its importance in the world is undeniable. Plus, AI will be a major determinant of the global geopolitical order.\n\nThe geostrategic balance of power in the world has changed greatly in the last half a century, in China's favor. China faces some major problems, economic and environmental, as do other countries. But the Chinese people seem to be overcoming their problems more sensibly and calmly than others. I think it is largely due to their culture of education, harmony, peace and rationality. I expect the coming Year of the Snake to see further Chinese advancement.\n\nThe author is a Sinologist and an emeritus professor at Griffith University in Australia.
