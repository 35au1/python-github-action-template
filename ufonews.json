It was one of three unidentified objects blasted out of the sky that month, according to CTV News.\n\nIt remains unclear what the object was and what it was doing flying over western Canada."

Even though the scientific community is yet to face any conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life, conspiracy theorists strongly believe that living beings from the distant nooks of the world have already visited planet earth.\n\nAmid all these speculations, the world is currently witnessing a new wave of unidentified flying object sightings in recent days.\n\nSocial Media Platforms Flooded with UFO Videos\n\nSocial media platforms like X and Facebook are currently being flooded with UFO sightings from countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Syria, and Australia.\n\nMost of these UFO sightings feature flying objects that are triangular in shape, which move across the skies without making any sound.\n\nAs UFO sightings rise across various nooks of the globe, conspiracy theorists strongly believe that an alien invasion is imminent.\n\nA few days back, a YouTuber had sensationally claimed that UFOs will start invading the earth on December 3, and conspiracy theorists argue that this prediction has turned true.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon and NASA have also started considering these UFO sightings very seriously, as they believe that the presence of these flying objects could threaten national security.\n\nHowever, authorities are refraining from using the word UFO, and instead they are calling these objects unidentified aerial phenomena.\n\nAre Aliens Time Travelers?\n\nAmid all these debates, Netflix, on December 8, released a documentary named Investigation Aliens.\n\nThe documentary which features George Knapp in the lead role tries to answer several questions including why aliens are visiting earth.\n\nAt the end of the documentary, which has an open-ended nature, makers suggest that UFOs and aliens which people see in the skies could be most probably time traveling humans from the future."

The upgrade included a revamped Siri, AI writing tools, smart replies, an updated Photos app, and a new focus mode called Reduce Interruptions.\n\nIt was a fraction of the flashy AI features Apple showed off at its Worldwide Developer Conference earlier this year, as the company decided to do a staggered rollout. This second wave of features will be followed by more launching next year.\n\nSo what can you expect when you update to iOS 18.2 later this week?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnticipated features in the December update include tools like Genmojis and Image Playground, among others. Like the earlier Apple Intelligence features, the newest AI features will be available for all iPhone 16 models and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nChatGPT integration\n\nApple's iOS 18.2 introduces ChatGPT integration. Apple\n\nSiri received some enhancements in the iOS 18.1 update, but the iOS 18.2 update will further improve the voice assistant and allow integrated access to ChatGPT. With iOS 18.2, users will have access to the popular OpenAI chatbot through Siri and they'll be able to access the tool by talking to the voice assistant or typing to it.\n\nVisual Intelligence\n\nApple's visual intelligence feature is expected in iOS 18.2 Apple\n\nThe new update will also allow iPhone 16 users to gather information by pointing their device at an object.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tool is similar to Google Lens, which does reverse image searches and helps identify landmarks, plants, and other objects or places.\n\nGenmojis\n\nCreate a personalized \"Genmoji.\" Apple\n\nFor those who prefer to communicate with emojis over the written word, Genmojis could be a game changer.\n\nThe new update allows users to be more playful and interactive in their messages, creating custom emojis right from the keyboard and animated Genmojis of themselves, similar to Bitmoji.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage Playground\n\nImage Playground was introduced at Apple's WWDC 2024. Apple\n\nApple's Image Playground is its answer to popular AI image generators like OpenAI's Dall-E or Midjourney. The tool was first demonstrated at Apple's WWDC conference earlier this year.\n\nRelated stories\n\nImage Playground users can create images based on a specific description or concept and will be able to select different formats like animation. The tool will be available as its own app and will also be accessible through third-party apps.\n\nPhoto updates\n\niOS 18.2 is expected to introduce several photo updates, including video enhancements like improvements for navigating Collections and the ability to view a video more finely, which can be helpful with editing. Users also have the option to clear their Recently Viewed and Recently Shared album history, and Favorites will appear in the Utility and Pinned Collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther updates\n\nApple's Mail app is getting an AI makeover that will categorize emails based on their priority level. The update will give access to the \"digest\" view, which organizes all emails from a sender in one place.\n\nApple's internet browser Safari should also receive some changes, including new customizable background images for the start page.\n\nApple is also expected to introduce Image Wand, a new tool for the iPad that turns sketches and written notes into images in the Notes app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple is also releasing some bug fixes and improvements with iOS 18.2, including a Podcast update that allows users to choose their favorite categories and get relevant recommendations in their library."

It essentially works like Google Scholar, where you input your query on the search bar, and it gives you a list of relevant research papers about that topic. However, on top of those papers, Consensus also acts like an AI chatbot and provides you with an easy-to-read analysis based on the top search results. For instance, if your query is \"Can mindfulness help with sleep?\" Consensus will show you a percentage rating of Yes, Possibly, or No, along with some key insights and even a conclusion derived from the papers. If the full text of the paper is available, Consensus also allows you to chat with the paper, so you don't have to read through the entire thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough you can use Consensus without creating an account, the features are very limited. The service offers both free and premium options; the free account gives you unlimited searches with research quality indicators, while features like Pro Analyses, Study Snapshots, and Ask Paper are limited. To use these functionalities without limits, you'd need to upgrade to the premium account."

            "article_content": "Haunting\u2014it's not just for houses any more! We do a quick survey of haunted spots around the world.\n\nWe explore some of Wikipedia\u2019s oddities in our 6,922,857-part monthly series, Wiki Wormhole.\n\nThis week\u2019s entry: List of Reportedly Haunted Locations\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: G-g-g-ghosts! Spooks and specters have been found hanging out everywhere from theme parks to beaches and mountains, as well as your classic cemeteries and abandoned insane asylums. Wikipedia lists haunted places in no less than 45 different countries. (Several countries, including the good ol\u2019 U.S. of Apparitions, have so many haunted locations they have a separate page. For our purposes, we\u2019re going to stick to the main page.)\n\nBiggest controversy: Every supernatural claim is by nature controversial (it should go without saying that the word \u201creportedly\u201d goes before every haunting mentioned here.) But the longest controversy on the list is that of the Chase Vault in Barbados. A sealed burial vault in the cemetery of Christ Church Parish Church, it was opened in the early 19th century for a burial, and the heavy lead coffins had switched positions. While the tale is called \u201chistorically dubious,\u201d it made it into James Edward Alexander\u2019s 1833 book Transatlantic Sketches and the story persists to this day.\n\nStrangest fact: No amount of power or status can keep one\u2019s soul from roaming the night in ghostly torment. Former Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley reportedly haunts the Hotel Kurrajong, where he died in 1951. People have seen him pointing towards Old Parliament House, which is also haunted (although the building\u2019s own Wikipedia page makes no mention.) And the Pharaoh himself haunts the Pyramids of Giza (although which pharaoh isn\u2019t specified).\n\nSeveral former seats of power make the list, including Egypt\u2019s Baron Empain Palace, Myanmar\u2019s Keng Tung palace (now a hotel), Pakistan\u2019s Mohatta Palace, Lisbon\u2019s Beau-S\u00e9jour Palace, Madrid\u2019s Palace Of Linares, and the Jakarta History Museum (formerly the capitol building under Dutch colonial rule).\n\nThing we were happiest to learn: There are a lot of haunted castles. Malahide Castle in north County Dublin (the surrounding town is the shooting location for most of Bad Sisters), has no less than five ghosts: a knight killed on his wedding day, a noblewoman who was married in the castle; a jester who was in love with a woman imprisoned in the castle (who was himself murdered), a painting of a lady in white who occasionally comes to life, and the man who was (temporarily) given the castle by Cromwell, and was hanged during the Restoration.\n\nIreland also accounts for Castles Charleville, Leap, and Ross, each with their own gruesome deaths and subsequent hauntings. Most gruesomely, Zvikov Castle in the Czech Republic is supposedly so haunted that anyone who sleeps in the main tower dies within a year, and spectral dogs with burning eyes guard a tunnel under the castle.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to top Germany which, alongside Lichtenegg, Schloss Nordkirchen, and Wolfsegg, boasts Frankenstein Castle, whose imposing towers allegedly inspired Mary Shelley\u2019s novel (and no less than Ghost Hunters International determined it had \u201csignificant paranormal activity.\u201d\n\nEuropeans even exported the haunted castle overseas. A Scottish businessman built Kellie\u2019s Castle in Malaysia for his wife, who died before building was completed. It\u2019s haunted not by her, but by the workers who died during construction. New Zealand also has Larnach Castle, haunted by the wife and daughter of the original owner.\n\nThing we were unhappiest to learn: Colonialism casts a long shadow. A lot of the haunted sites are the sites of past atrocities by colonial powers: Vietnam\u2019s Ma Thi\u00ean L\u00e3nh Bridge was built by 300 prisoners, forced into labor under French rule, and a number of ghosts haunt the site. Besides the Jakarta History Museum, Indonesia is home to Toko Merah, a Dutch colonial building that was the site of a massacre, as well as torture and killings by the regime, and screaming at night can still be heard there. The Japanese (allegedly) tortured and executed Malaysian locals at what eventually became the Shih Chung Branch School, and the now-abandoned building is haunted by their ghosts.\n\nBest link to elsewhere on Wikipedia: We honestly thought parapsychology was a term made-up for the original Ghostbusters, but it\u2019s been an active discipline since philosopher Max Dessoir coined the phrase in 1889. It\u2019s the study of \u201calleged psychic phenomena,\u201d a list that includes \u201cextrasensory perception, telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, and psychometry,\u201d as well as near-death experiences, synchronicity, and apparitional experiences, and again, it\u2019s hard not to hear that list being read off in Annie Potts\u2019 most jaded tone of voice.\n\nFurther down the Wormhole: These stories are all relatively recent, compared to the folklore surrounding ghosts, which has existed as long as people have been dying and telling stories. Children have long had an entirely separate world of folklore, concerning the consequences of stepping on a crack, and whether or not Batman smells. Their mysterious culture also includes children\u2019s games, which recent generations of adults seem loath to let go of. One such game, pencil fighting, is an unlikely candidate to spawn an adult league, but here we are. There isn\u2019t quite enough in the world of extreme pencil fighting to justify a full-length column, so we\u2019ll wrap up the year with a bunch of short topics before resuming our regular format in 2025."

            "article_content": "December is here and with it, streamers are getting their monthly influx of new titles to watch. From \u201cWicked\u201d director Jon M. Chu\u2019s first feature to one of the standout horror movies of 2024 you might have missed, there are plenty of new movies on Hulu in December worth tuning into. To help you skip the infinite scrolling, here\u2019s a curated selection of the best new movies streaming on Hulu this month.\n\n\u201cGladiator\u201d (Universal Pictures)\n\n\u2018Gladiator\u2019 (2000)\n\nIf the long-awaited arrival of Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator\u201d sequel has you in the mood to revisit the original 2000 film, Hulu has you covered this December. Russell Crowe stars as Maximus Decimus Meridius, a faithful soldier of the Roman Empire, loyal to Marcus Aurelius, who loses everything at the hands of Marcus\u2019 scheming, sniveling son Commodus (a slithery Joaquin Phoenix) and winds up fighting for his life in the Gladiator arena. Nearly 25 years later, Scott\u2019s blood-pumping historical action epic still swings a sharp sword, and Crowe\u2019s compelling performance holds up even better in light of the second film. It\u2019s a five-time Oscar-winning epic and a bona fide crowd-pleaser, what more could you want for a holiday season stream?\n\nDisney\n\n\u2018The Muppets\u2019 (2011)\n\nUntil someone comes along to revive the beloved puppet brand once again, 2011\u2019s \u201cThe Muppets\u201d is the best recent film entry in the long and ever-entertaining canon. It\u2019s also, unfortunately, a rather timely watch in 2024, with the recent sale of the Henson Company\u2019s Chaplin Studios and Muppets*3D shutting down at Disney World\u2019s Hollywood Studios. Jason Segel and Amy Adams star as Gary and Mary, the human helpers to the world\u2019s biggest Muppets fan, Walter (also a Muppet), who rallies with the Muppets themselves to save Muppet Studios after a ruthless businessman (Chris Cooper) sets his sights on razing the lot to drill for oil. Super charming, with great (and Oscar-winning) original songs \u2014 by \u201cFlight of the Conchords'\u201d Brett McKenzie, no less \u2014 \u201cThe Muppets\u201d is charming feel-good watch.\n\nNeon\n\n\u2018Cuckoo\u2019 (2024)\n\nOne of the year\u2019s most distinctive horror movies hits streaming this month, Neon\u2019s \u201cCuckoo.\u201d Starring \u201cEuphoria\u201d breakout and \u201cThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\u201d star Hunter Schafer, \u201cCuckoo\u201d follows teenager Gretchen (Schafer) to a remote Alpine resort in Germany, where she reluctantly moves in with her estranged father, stepmother and half-sister after her mother\u2019s death. There, she also meets her father\u2019s mysterious and imposing boss, Herr K\u00f6nig (Dan Stevens doing a German accent with his whole chest), and stars to experience strange, scary and otherworldly phenomenon. Though not as fright-forward as you might expect, \u2018Cuckoo\u2019 casts its strange spell rather well, and director Tilman Singer once again proves himself a singular voice after his stellar 2018 debut \u201cLuz.\u201d\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n\u2018Moulin Rouge\u2019 (2001)\n\nThe vibrant, delirious Baz Luhrmann (\u201cElvis\u201d) jukebox musical \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d arrives on Hulu this month, and if you\u2019ve never seen it before, it\u2019s a whirlwind of music, tapestry, lust and romance that must be experienced. Luhrmann ecstatically embraces his style of excess here, making the film an endless rush of colors, textures and sounds \u2014 and of course, some of the most beloved songs of all time, from Elton John\u2019s \u201cYour Song\u201d to Nirvana\u2019s \u201cTeen Spirit.\u201d Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are magnetic and so swoon-worthy as a doomed, radiant courtesan and the romantic poet who falls in love with her, belting out their hearts, and sweeping you up in their tragic tale.\n\n20th Century Studios\n\n\u2018Speed\u2019 (1994)\n\nThere\u2019s a bomb on a bus, and it will go off if Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock can\u2019t keep it speeding over 50 mph. Might not sound too intense, but factor in red lights, pedestrians, rush hour traffic, dwindling gas supplies and all the other factors that make driving such a difficult task and you\u2019ve got one of the most inspired concepts for one of the greatest action thrillers of the 90s.\n\nSummit Entertainment\n\n\u2018Twilight\u2019 (2008)\n\nHeads up for the \u201cTwilight\u201d lovers, the whole Saga is headed to Hulu this month. The series isn\u2019t always streaming, so if you\u2019ve been longing for a re-watch, now\u2019s the time. Future indie darlings Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in the YA vampire romance sensation that sparked an infamously passionate fan response and equally intense cultural counter-vitriol. In retrospect, the first film is a rather swooning, handsomely-made YA paranormal romance, and love it or hate it, undeniably an icon of its times all these years later. And with a killer soundtrack, to boot.\n\nLionsgate\n\n\u2018Step Up 2 The Streets\u2019 (2008)\n\nJon M. Chu is currently flying high and tearing it up at the box office with the first half of \u201cWicked\u201d adaptation, but if you want to throw it back \u2014 physically or nostalgically \u2014 Hulu is currently streaming his 2008 feature film debut. A sequel to the more romance-forward 2006 \u201cStep Up,\u201d which catapulted Channing Tatum to stardom, \u201cStep Up 2 The Streets\u201d introduced a new cast and a new style, amping up the dance sequences significantly, amplified by Chu\u2019s signature euphoric kinetics. There\u2019s a school romance here too and the movie has plenty of charm, but really, this one is about the dances; big, ambitious, heavily-choreographed ensemble numbers that make you want to get up and get in on the party.\n\nThe post The 7 Best New Movies on Hulu in December 2024 appeared first on TheWrap."

            "article_content": "We also published the following articles recently\n\nAgri university scientists discover medicinal compound in makhana\n\nScientists at Bihar Agricultural University have made a groundbreaking discovery in makhana (fox nut), identifying a unique compound with medicinal properties. This compound, N-(2-iodophenyl) methane sulfonamide, has potential pharmacological applications, boosting makhana's value beyond a snack. This discovery could revolutionize the makhana industry, benefiting farmers and potentially impacting global snacking habits.\n\nFunds pending for restoration of school compound walls\n\nMonsoon rains wreaked havoc on 297 government schools in Mangaluru, damaging buildings and boundary walls. While the district administration disbursed Rs 4.6 crore to 244 schools for critical repairs, 53 schools with damaged walls were left without funding. These schools are now tasked with finding alternative resources like MGNREGA to address the remaining repairs, estimated to cost significantly more.\n\nGSFC Universitys lab gets NABL accreditation\n\nGSFC University's chemical instrumentation laboratory in Vadodara has received accreditation from the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) for drinking water quality testing. This prestigious recognition, based on ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standards, covers 19 parameters. The lab's accreditation will significantly boost student learning, research, and the university's mission to produce highly skilled graduates.\n\nBhagalpur: As makhana (fox nut) gains popularity as a healthy snack, scientists at Bihar Agricultural University (BAU), Sabour, have achieved a major breakthrough. They have identified a unique compound, N-(2-iodophenyl) methane sulfonamide, in makhana, which has vital medicinal property.\u201cThis is the first time the bioactive compound has been identified as a naturally occurring component in makhana,\u201d said vice-chancellor (VC) D R Singh. He added that the compound, a sulfonamide derivative of iodobenzene, is known for its pharmacological potential. \u201cThis finding proves the therapeutic potential of makhana and promises to boost its global recognition and market value. It could revolutionise both the makhana industry and global snacking habits,\u201d he said.Singh added the research reflects BAU\u2019s commitment to innovation, uplifting farmers\u2019 economic conditions and positioning Bihar as a hub for cutting-edge agricultural advancements. \u201cThis finding will inspire farmers to combine traditional farming with modern science.\u201dDr Anil Kumar Singh, director of research at BAU, filed a patent for the discovery. He said makhana, traditionally valued as a nutritious food, is now recognised as a bioactive resource with medicinal value. \u201cThis positions makhana as more than just a snack \u2014 it becomes a key player in the nutraceutical industry, attracting interest from pharmaceutical companies and boosting its economic potential,\u201d he said.The research team revealed that makhana is not only rich in nutrients but also has antioxidant and therapeutic properties.Conducted in the university\u2019s NABL-accredited laboratory, the study was led by a team of scientists and faculty members, including V Shajeeda Banu (plant biotechnology), Pritam Ganguly (soil science and agricultural chemistry), Anil Kumar (horticulture) and Dr Anil Kumar Singh (director of research)."

            "source": "TechRadar",
            "article_content": "FAQs\n\nDoes Samsung offer free shipping? Yes, all orders come with free shipping by default, meaning you won't be charged additional charges on top of the price you pay. If you want to get your goods quicker, you can pay for expedited shipping at the checkout.\n\nWhat is Samsung Rewards? Samsung has its own Samsung Rewards program, a loyalty scheme for regular customers. Anyone can sign up for this, regardless of whether they use Samsung Pay, and you'll earn some points back per purchase. As of writing, one point equates to around $0.005 of value, and you can earn points not just from purchases but also by referring friends to the Samsung Store and with free 'random' giveaways by Samsung itself.\n\nWho qualifies for Samsung first responder discount? Paramedics, firefighters, police, doctors, nurses, and anyone who can be readily accessed via a 911 call for their job should be qualified for the Samsung first responder program. To check your eligibility, you must verify yourself using your work email and a valid ID using the ID.me service on the Samsung site. While there are a few hoops to jump through here, discounts can range up to 30% off, so it's definitely worth investigating if you think you're eligible.\n\nWhen and what is Samsung Week? Samsung Week is the official Samsung Store's big annual sale, offering some of the best discounts you'll find all year round on phones, TVs, and appliances, among other tech. In past years, this week-long shopping extravaganza was held in late October or early November, which generally coincides with the build-up to the yearly Black Friday sales. If you're on the hunt for some discounted Samsung tech then you'll want to watch for this year's Samsung Week, which we're expecting to fall on similar dates.\n\nWhat is Samsung Pay? Samsung Pay is the brand's own digital payment method, and you can use it to make contactless payments on all kinds of purchases. Users of the scheme will also receive the occasional Samsung Cashback deal, letting you earn money back for using their service and making purchases.\n\nHow do I contact Samsung customer service? You can contact Samsung via phone on 1-800-SAMSUNG. Alternatively, you can contact them online via their website or social media platforms.\n\nDoes Samsung price match? If you find a better price for a Samsung product at a recognized third-party retailer, Samsung will match or beat that price. You can save even more by using our discount codes.\n\nDoes Samsung offer a warranty for their products? Yes, Samsung offers a warranty on all products bought directly from them. Warranties can vary from product to product, so it's essential to confirm the warranty on your product by contacting the Samsung customer service team.\n\nHints and tips\n\nTrade in your old devices: Like many other retailers, the Samsung Store offers a competitive trade-in program that you can use to safely dispose of your old tech and get some juicy discounts on new purchases. Suppose you have an old phone, laptop, or tablet that works and is in relatively good condition. In that case, we'd highly recommend investigating the myriad trade-in options you'll find before you check out one of the latest Galaxy smartphones, Galaxy Book laptops, or Galaxy Tab tablets.\n\nShop around big retail events: Yearly events like Black Friday or Samsung Week are great times to shop at the official Samsung Store. Generally speaking, these run from late October to early December, and you'll regularly find the best prices all year on TVs and appliances at the Samsung store, as well as things like free smartwatches and earbuds being offered with Galaxy smartphones. Even though these two previously mentioned events occur late in the year, you'll generally find excellent deals on the Samsung offers page around other retail events like President's Day, Labor Day, and Amazon Prime Day in mid-summer.\n\nShop refurbished devices: Not bothered about getting the shiniest new device possible? A great alternative to buying a new device upfront is heading to the Samsung-certified re-newed store. Here, you'll find many pre-owned items that have been checked, refurbished, and tested by Samsung itself up for sale with discounts ranging up to 30% off new prices. Since these items are guaranteed under a 1-year warranty and are in 'like-new' condition, this is potentially a great option for bargain hunters and is much more eco-friendly than buying tech new.\n\nUse student, military, and first responder discounts: Samsung offers a diverse range of exclusive discounts for certain occupations and students that are well worth checking out if you think you're eligible. While you'll need a relevant email address and photo ID, first responders, government workers, military workers, and Samsung employees are all eligible for discounts of up to 30%.\n\nRefer a friend: Signing up to the Samsung rewards scheme also unlocks the option to refer a friend for additional rewards. While your friend will get 5% off their purchase, you can potentially get points up to $100 per friend, for a potential total of $1,000 per year. If you know a friend who likes their Samsung tech as much as you do, it's a great idea to ask them for a referral, or vice versa.\n\nHow to use Samsung promo codes 1. Choose one of our Samsung promo codes you'd like to use and click \"Get Code\" to reveal it. 2. Copy the code for later, then head to the Samsung website and start shopping. 3. Add the items you want to your shopping cart as you go, then click on your cart when you're ready to place your order. 4. Below the \"Order Summary,\" you'll find a field labelled \"Enter Promo/Referral Code(s) Here.\" 5. Manually enter your coupon code in the provided field, click \"Apply,\" and the discount code will automatically be applied to your purchase. 6. Proceed through the rest of the checkout as usual to place your order.\n\nHow we source coupon codes\n\nWhether it's through our affiliate networks, the depths of the world wide web, or our connections with big name brands, here at TechRadar we use every tool at our disposal to source the latest codes. Our coupons team updates each of our pages multiple times a week with the most recent deals, including exclusive coupons negotiated by our Commercial team. We also include the latest sales info directly from retailers to offer the most up-to-date discounts around.\n\nHow we test coupon codes\n\nEach coupon you find on TechRadar has been tested before being uploaded by our dedicated Deals & Offers teams. You\u2019ll see a range of offers, from free shipping to student discounts, with savings available on all kinds of products & services. To make sure every coupon is ready to use, we don\u2019t list any user-specific or one-time codes.\n\nWe also include all relevant information about coupons, such as expiry dates and any terms & conditions, near the \u2018Get Code\u2019 button. You can see the details for an individual offer by clicking on the \u2018Terms & Conditions\u2019 text below the code and expanding the code area.\n\nWhat to do if a coupon code doesn\u2019t work\n\nAlthough we do our best to ensure all listed codes are tried & tested, sometimes coupons expire or terms & conditions are changed before we can update pages. Our team works hard to make sure our coupons are active and work as intended, and should you encounter an issue when using one, we\u2019ll work just as hard to help.\n\nThe best place to start is by checking the requirements. Click \u201cView terms and conditions\u201d to expand the code section and see any guidance on your chosen coupon. For example, you may need to meet a minimum spend, add other items to your basket to qualify for a multibuy offer, or confirm that your chosen code applies to the items in your basket (i.e. 10% off laptops).\n\nIf you\u2019re still having issues using your code, you can email our customer service team on coupons.techradar@futurenet.com. Include as many details as possible - such as which code you used and which coupon page it\u2019s listed on so our team can address your issue as fast as possible.\n\nHow we make money\n\nWhen it comes to coupons, TechRadar earns money via a commission-based model. For every brand we have a coupon page for, we\u2019ve negotiated a deal that means we earn a percentage of total basket value in commission back from every order.\n\nUsing this model means we can offer our coupons to our customers free of charge. You won\u2019t pay any fees to add your chosen coupon to your basket - you\u2019ll simply pay the final order total once your discount has been applied."

            "article_content": "At the heart of this cosmic mystery lies the Higgs field, a fundamental component of our universe that gives particles their mass. However, this field isn\u2019t as stable as we once thought. Scientists have discovered that the Higgs field could potentially \u201cbubble,\u201d creating pockets of altered reality where nothing could exist.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher, Lucien Heurtier, explains : \u201cThe Higgs field isn\u2019t likely to be in the lowest possible energy state it could be in. That means it could theoretically change its state, dropping to a lower energy state in a certain location.\u201d\n\nThis revelation has profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos. If the Higgs field were to shift to a lower energy state, it would dramatically alter the laws of physics within these \u201cbubbles.\u201d In such an environment :\n\nElectron masses would suddenly change\n\nParticle interactions would be altered\n\nProtons and neutrons would disintegrate\n\nLife as we know it would cease to exist\n\nThe paradox deepens when we consider the early universe and the hypothetical existence of primordial black holes. These minuscule black holes, potentially as small as a gram, are believed to have formed during the universe\u2019s inflationary period, mere moments after the Big Bang.\n\nPrimordial black holes : the universe\u2019s self-destruct button ?\n\nThe research team argues that if primordial black holes existed as current models suggest, they should have triggered widespread \u201cbubbling\u201d of the Higgs field. This cosmic chain reaction would have prevented the formation of any stable matter in the universe. Yet, here we are, contemplating our own existence.\n\nThis paradox presents scientists with two possible explanations :\n\nOur current models of primordial black holes are incorrect and need to be discarded There are fundamental aspects of the Higgs field\u2019s behavior that we don\u2019t yet understand\n\nThe implications of this study extend far beyond theoretical physics. It challenges our understanding of the universe\u2019s origins and stability, forcing us to reconsider established theories. This paradox is reminiscent of other unexpected discoveries that have baffled astronomers, pushing the boundaries of our cosmic knowledge.\n\nUnraveling the cosmic tapestry : new frontiers in physics\n\nAs scientists grapple with this existential paradox, new avenues of research are emerging. The quest to understand the universe\u2019s existence has led to innovative experiments and theoretical frameworks. One such breakthrough is the quantum cat experiment that set a record by surviving 1,400 seconds, pushing the boundaries of quantum superposition.\n\nThese advancements in quantum physics may hold the key to unraveling the Higgs field mystery. By exploring the behavior of particles at the quantum level, scientists hope to gain insights into the stability of the Higgs field and its interactions with other cosmic phenomena.\n\nThe study of cosmic paradoxes extends beyond the realm of physics. Recent research has even challenged our understanding of what happens in the brain after death, defying all logic. These discoveries highlight the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines and the need for a holistic approach to understanding our universe.\n\nRedefining reality : the impact on scientific thought\n\nThe revelation that the universe shouldn\u2019t exist according to current models has profound implications for scientific thought. It challenges researchers to question established theories and explore new paradigms. This shift in thinking could lead to revolutionary discoveries across various fields, from astrophysics to quantum mechanics.\n\nTo illustrate the potential impact of this paradigm shift, consider the following table :\n\nScientific Field Current Understanding Potential Paradigm Shift Cosmology Big Bang Theory Multi-dimensional universe models Particle Physics Standard Model Unified field theories Quantum Mechanics Copenhagen Interpretation Many-worlds interpretation Astrophysics Dark Matter/Energy Modified gravity theories\n\nAs scientists continue to probe the mysteries of the universe, unexpected discoveries are reshaping our understanding of reality. From new types of materials that could change our lives to fundamental questions about existence itself, the frontiers of science are expanding rapidly.\n\nThe paradox of the universe\u2019s existence serves as a humbling reminder of how much we have yet to learn. It invites us to embrace uncertainty, question our assumptions, and continue exploring the cosmic tapestry that surrounds us. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the Higgs field and primordial black holes, we may uncover truths that reshape our understanding of reality itself."

            "article_content": "The latest Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics just dropped, and it is filled with goodies ranging from new missions to plans for space weather.\n\nThe report comes from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and it outlines top priorities for space agencies and affiliated institutions in better understanding the solar system in the next decade. The report draws on 450 papers from the science community as well as other events including presentations and town halls.\n\nDecadal surveys are important; they outline science objectives for a wide array of scientists. In 2021, the academies outlined finding Earth-like exoplanets, understanding the universe\u2019s densest objects, and improving understanding of the birth and growth of galaxies as top astronomical priorities.\n\nThe following year, the report dedicated to planetary science and astrobiology concluded that a Uranus probe should be the highest priority mission. Last year, a report from the academies put a sustained human presence off-Earth on the docket.\n\nThis year\u2019s report covered the gamut of solar and space physics, including how to better track the dynamic environment of our solar system and better understand the star at its heart.\n\nThe report called for NASA to pursue a mission that would launch a constellation of satellites that would observe the space environment near Earth and a spacecraft that would image the Sun at its poles. The report identified the National Science Foundation\u2019s Next Generation Global Oscillations Network, a solar observatory network, as the highest-priority large construction project.\n\nFuture modeling of space weather systems should also make use of artificial intelligence, according to the report. Specifically, machine learning-driven models of the surface of the Sun could better anticipate eruptions from the surface of the star, and data assimilation could be done swiftly by AI programs, hastening the pace of discovery. The report also recommended that the NSF develop a strategic plan for space weather , that NOAA establish a program for it, and partner with the Department of Defense to develop predictive space weather models. The report also called for NASA to grow the spaceflight element of its Heliophysics Space Weather program; the Parker Solar Probe\u2019s dive into the Sun comes to mind, as an ambitious endeavor that yielded new insights into space weather.\n\n\u201cLack of progress in solar and space physics over the next decade could have devastating consequences to society, in part because it would inhibit our ability to predict and mitigate against potentially harmful space weather impacts,\u201d said committee co-chair Stephen Fuselier, acting vice president of the Southwest Research Institute\u2019s space science division, in an academies release.\n\n\u201cWhile making substantive progress will require modest additional investments from the government, research into these areas is of paramount importance,\u201d Fuselier added. \u201cThis report helps provide a window into the future of the field and safeguard a growing range of industries here on Earth, and enables humanity to become a true space-faring civilization.\u201d\n\nSpace weather is a dynamic phenomenon that even affects those of us on Earth; our planet was hit by several intense geomagnetic storms this year, causing auroras around the world and some electronic disruptions. But in space, such weather events can be severe for equipment that, albeit shielded, is not within the relatively safe cocoon of our planet\u2019s magnetosphere.\n\n\u201cThe solar and space physics field is at a pivotal point right now, and we have the opportunity in the coming years to pursue some really exciting science\u2014both for science\u2019s sake and to achieve major improvements to our understanding of things like space weather,\u201d said Robyn Millan, an astronomer at Dartmouth College and co-chair of the committee that wrote the report, in an academies release.\n\nAs we Earthlings ramp up exploration of our solar system (and, dare I say, beyond?), it\u2019s crucial for governing bodies to outline the types of missions and the funding required to take those ambitious next steps sooner rather than later. The report provides a north star for those goals, and gives the public something to get excited about."

            "article_content": "As the new year approaches, governments should be developing technology investment plans and setting priorities, writes Dean Lacheca.\n\nCybersecurity remains at the top of the priority list for 2025, as it was for 2024. The ongoing pressure to achieve Essential Eight compliance along with the new Cyber Security Act will see this remain a priority throughout the coming year.\n\nThe drive for AI adoption has renewed the focus on data and data management to improve the analytic capabilities of departments and ensure their critical data is AI ready. Beyond this, cloud platform adoption will continue to grow as governments press to reduce technical debt and associated risk.\n\nWhen making digital technology investments in 2025, governments need to keep in mind critical outcomes. These will be largely dependent on the mission of the agency/department. Those with citizen-facing missions are strongly focussed on improving citizen experience, extending the inclusivity of government services, and improving the speed, consistency and efficiency of the government workforce to indirectly improve the citizen experience.\n\nThose that are not citizen-facing are very focused on workforce productivity and are looking at all options for automation and technology-led efficiencies.\n\nAs for the top focus areas for chief information officers during 2025, the biggest shift year on year is a significant jump in the focus of government on efficiency and risk. They have always been drivers, but ongoing austerity across the region and a more conservative shift toward risk reduction and mitigation has seen this focus on human capital effectiveness.\n\nThis has seen the top priority for government CIOs being to manage technology risk. The austerity drive around Australia has also seen an increase in CIO focus on managing technology financials and communicating the value of IT.\n\nThere is a need for agility going forward\n\nThe top three technologies governments plan to deploy in 2025 are generative AI, AI and low-code/no-code development platforms. So what benefits will this provide for governments and how will these technologies help them achieve their mission objectives? There are slightly different motivations for the different technology investments.\n\nGenerative AI and AI adoption are linked directly into the desire to deliver improved citizen experience and to improve workforce productivity. Citizen-facing generative AI is expected to improve the quality of chatbots and virtual assistants as well as enable the path to conversational government services.\n\nInternally, the drive for automation and efficiency is driving towards agentic AI, where AI supports and enables decision intelligence and the automation of internal processes.\n\nAdoption of low-code/no-code development platforms by governments is also growing rapidly. This is a reflection of multiple challenges converging for governments. Firstly, governments have learnt from the impact of extensive customisation of base systems. The use of these contemporary platforms allows them to configure the behaviour of the system without creating a support challenge.\n\nThe next demand is the need for agility going forward. Adjusting government policy is often slow to implement due to legacy systems being difficult to change. Governments expect that these contemporary platforms offer them the capabilities to implement change more rapidly.\n\nThough these platforms do enable change to be executed more effectively than those built in legacy technologies, they do not remove the need for extensive change management to mitigate the risk of change.\n\nThe other challenge faced by government is the lack of available resources with specialist skills. The expectation is that low-code platforms allow governments to source capability internally or from the market, with retaining existing resources a valid option.\n\nDean Lacheca is VP analyst at Gartner"

The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a New Yorker and a staunch believer in public transportation. For most of my life, I never owned a car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, all the forms of public transportation I used daily were unsafe.\n\nI had to think about how I could transport my then-five-year-old and how I would reach family members if something terrible happened.\n\nI considered getting a car for the first time. I made this list: It was written in Sharpie on a piece of grid paper, and it said, \"New?\" \"Used?\" \"EV???\" However, I had to immediately eliminate electric vehicles from my potential options because, in 2020, there was no accessible place to charge them in Brooklyn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realized there was a lack of infrastructure to transition to EV cars and that was the seed idea for my company.\n\nAlthough my career was in design, I pivoted and cofounded a climate tech startup called It's Electric in 2022. We're focused on scaling electric vehicle charging in densely populated cities.\n\nWe're now a company of 10 people and we've received $11.8 million in funding and grants. Uber invested in our seed round. My best advice is to find simple solutions to big pain points and prove your work with receipts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe found a simple solution for electric charging\n\nWhen we started building It's Electric in 2021, my cofounder and I conducted research to determine what was preventing EV chargers from being deployed quickly and at scale in US cities.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIn a city like London, there are a lot of lampposts that have been retrofitted into curbside chargers because they can handle 220 to 240 volts of electricity. In the US, the power feeds in our lamposts are typically much lower, at 110 volts.\n\nIf we wanted to have lamppost chargers, we'd need to upgrade the utility main and corresponding interconnection agreement, load analysis, transformer, submeter, and customer connection box.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe discovered that one asset in cities, that has plenty of power ready to go, is buildings, which we can use to power public chargers.\n\nIf a library, home, or commercial building agrees to power a public charger, we share revenue with that building to give them passive income as an incentive. It's a very simple idea. We say it's not deep tech, it's shallow tech.\n\nRunning a pilot helped get investors on board\n\nOur business started with just us two founders, but after we raised a $2.2 million pre-seed round in May 2023, we hired our first two employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring our pre-seed stage, multiple investors told me that our idea was so simple that it must not work, or surely someone else was already doing it. We had to prove that a simple solution could be effective.\n\nOne way we did that was by getting our pilot off the ground in 2023.\n\nWe secured our partnership with Hyundai after winning their EV Open Innovation Challenge. Winners were selected based on their potential to expand market access to electric vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe knew we needed to test in the real world and in a notoriously hard-to-open city. So we approached the New York City Economic Development Corporation to ask if we could pilot our technology on their buildings in the Brooklyn Army Terminal. After much work, this became our first pilot and was crucial to landing investment.\n\nOur work on this pilot was so successful that EDC launched a brand new program based on our pilot.\n\nHave receipts and discuss your wins\n\nOur pilot demonstrated that our solution offsets emissions, and we could collect data from the demo to show it was scalable, low-cost, and quick to install.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pilot meant I could provide investors with proven results. We'd gone beyond what investors expected of us, which placated their queries and also attracted investors we hadn't yet spoken to.\n\nHaving a small-scale demonstration of your solution is more helpful in pitching to a large corporation than trying to sell a concept. It meant we were able to demonstrate a Series A level of progress at a pre-seed level.\n\nSo many investors said, \"If it is so simple and such a good idea, then why aren't others already doing it?\" My answer was, \"Because no one else is doing it, we are the first.\" My advice to founders is to be tenacious but make sure you have the receipts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe talked about our wins, such as prize nominations and media acknowledgments, to show investors that, by the jury of peers, our solution is winning.\n\nUber invested in our seed round\n\nIn July 2024, we closed our $6.5 million seed round, which was co-led by a Nordic fund, Failup Ventures, and Uber. Now, we're a team of 10.\n\nOur involvement with Uber began when we met representatives from the company at a conference. Everyone thinks of companies like Uber as big corporate giants, but we started our partnership with them by chance. It wasn't a sales or business meeting; it was just two optimistic people working in transportation who had a great conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA big challenge to Uber's zero-emissions goal is that Uber drivers live in cities and don't have garages, so it's really hard to charge electric vehicles. We provided a cheap, fast solution for urban drivers to charge electric cars. Uber needed more drivers to adopt electric cars to reach its goals, and we pitched ourselves as that stepping stone. A series of productive conversations helped us build this partnership.\n\nHaving Uber support our solution has been a great validation for our startup. It's also meant we've had access to smart people on their team to understand different policies and how we can help meet city goals.\n\nMy advice for founders who want to develop relationships with established companies is to try to solve problems for other people. Don't say you want a partnership because of what it can do for your startup, but put yourself out there as the problem-solver for a larger corporation. You want to find their pain point and point out that there isn't a solution that's already in the market."

(NYSE:INFA) stands against the other AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm.\n\nIt seems that major tech companies in Silicon Valley are forging relationships with the defense industry these days. In the latest news, prominent artificial intelligence company OpenAI has entered a partnership with Anduril, a defense startup that produces missiles, drones, and software for the United States military.\n\nREAD NOW: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss.\n\nThe companies said that this partnership will emphasize on the improvement of the United States\u2019 counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) as well as their ability to deal with potentially lethal aerial threats in real-time. The CUAS will enable defense against drone strikes by detecting and intercepting them while they are airborne.\n\nAccording to Brian Schimpf, cofounder and CEO of Anduril, OpenAI\u2019s AI models will be used to improve systems used for air defense. The technology will be used to \u201cassess drone threats more quickly and accurately, giving operators the information they need to make better decisions while staying out of harm\u2019s way\u201d, revealed a former OpenAI employee.\n\n\u201cOpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports US-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values\u2026 Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects US military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free.\u201d -Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s CEO.\n\nLast month, OpenAI rival Anthropic also entered a partnership with a famous defense contractor to provide \u201cUS intelligence and defense agencies\u201d access to its AI models. Regardless of its competitors\u2019 actions, OpenAI shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. After months of tender offers and a soaring valuation, the company has reached a new record of 300 million weekly active users. The announcement was made by Sam Altman during an appearance at The New York Times\u2019 Dealbook Conference on Wednesday, December 4th. The company is reportedly targeting 1 billion active users by next year.\n\nThese strategies aim to strengthen OpenAI\u2019s position against competitors Anthropic and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, the latter of which Sam Altman considers a \u201cfierce competitor\u201d. Besides that, it is also striving to gain a larger slice of the generative AI market, which may top $1 trillion in revenue by the next decade. Altman also revealed that his company hasn\u2019t asked investors not to invest in its competitors. However, those who decide to wouldn\u2019t have access to OpenAI\u2019s \u201cinformation rights,\u201d like the company\u2019s roadmap and other materials.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nInformatica Inc. (NYSE:INFA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22\n\nInformatica Inc. (NYSE:INFA) is a leader in enterprise AI-powered cloud data management.

Google says \u201cGenCast is \u2026 trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-h steps and 0.25\u00b0 latitude\u2013longitude resolution, for more than 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 min\u201d.\n\nThe result is a forecast that \u201chas greater skill than ENS on 97.2 per cent of 1,320 targets we evaluated and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclone tracks and wind power production\u201d.\n\nThe upshot, as we enter \u201cthe next chapter in operational weather forecasting\u201d, is that \u201ccrucial weather-dependent decisions [will be] made more accurately and efficiently\u201d.\n\nYou can read the Nature paper here."

Its foreign ministry issued a statement of \u201cextreme concern\u201d about \u201cthe dramatic events\u201d and announced that Mr. al-Assad had left the country. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, told Russian news agencies that he had nothing to add. Mr. Putin himself has said nothing about Syria in recent weeks.\n\nThe extent of the fallout for Moscow of Mr. al-Assad\u2019s removal is still to be determined. The key question, analysts said, is whether Russia manages to strike an agreement with Syria\u2019s new government to hold on to its Tartus naval base and its Hmeimim air base, where Mr. Putin delivered that victory speech in 2017.\n\nMr. Mardasov said he was unsure whether Russia would be able to strike such a deal, given that Russia used those bases for overwhelming airstrikes against Syria\u2019s opposition after the Kremlin intervened in Syria\u2019s civil war in 2015. Losing the Syrian bases would thwart some of Mr. Putin\u2019s ambitions to reestablish Russia as a world power, since they are crucial to the Kremlin\u2019s ability to flex its muscles in places as far away as West Africa.\n\n\u201cSyria is their only real foothold in the Middle East and the Mediterranean,\u201d said Eugene Rumer, the director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. The rebel victory, he said, has become \u201cpart of the price they are paying for the war in Ukraine.\u201d"

After taking much of Aleppo, its fighters moved on to the next front line, leaving the city to technocrats who came to preserve government institutions, Mr. al-Jolani said. His group said that public institutions would remain under the oversight of the country\u2019s prime minister until there was a transition.\n\nAn enduring conflict\n\nThe Syrian war began in 2011 with a peaceful uprising against the government and spiraled into a complex conflict involving armed rebels, extremists and others.\n\nThe origins: The conflict started when Syrians rose up peacefully against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The protests were met with a violent crackdown, while communities took up arms to defend themselves. Civil war ensued.\n\nOther groups became involved. Amid the chaos, Syria\u2019s ethnic Kurdish minority took up arms and gradually took territory it saw as its own. The Islamic State seized parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014 and declared that territory its \u201ccaliphate,\u201d further destabilizing the region."

Its shares were trading up 12.1% at 13.2 euros by 1445 GMT.\n\nReason for the buyout talks\n\nThe buyout talks come as some minority shareholders, including AJ Investments, have been pushing for either a take-private or a sale of Ubisoft to a strategic investor amid the stock price plunge, as previously reported.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares fell to their lowest level in the last decade in September after it cut its outlook on weaker-than-expected sales and postponed the launch of \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed Shadows.\u201d.\n\nThis week it announced it would discontinue development of its gaming title XDefiant and, as a consequence, close its production studios in San Francisco and Osaka and ramp down production in Sydney.\n\nUbisoft is run by the Guillemot family, which owns 15% of the firm, followed by Tencent, which owns just under 10%, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe family held about 20.5% of Ubisoft\u2019s net voting rights while Tencent owned 9.2% as of the end of April, as per the firm\u2019s latest annual report."

Some analysts say that predicting what comes next is made more challenging because the government\u2019s sudden demise took many people who have watched the region for years by surprise.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to bring process and a smooth transition to a fast-moving situation,\u201d said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, a research institute in London. \u201cThe speed and uncertainty poses many risks for what comes next pertaining to accountability and good governance to protect the interests of the Syrian people.\u201d\n\nMr. al-Assad ruled Syria for nearly a quarter of a century, presiding over the suppression of an uprising by civilians and a rebellion that began in 2011. In the ensuing war, more than half a million Syrians died, including 200,000 civilians, according to human rights groups. Millions of people fled the country."

            "article_content": "Once considered an unprofitable niche, electric vehicles (EVs) are now big business. Sales reached more than 14 million in 2023, and 18% of cars sold were electric, according to the International Energy Agency. The biggest electric car companies have continued increasing production to keep up with demand. China now has three of the world's top 10 EV manufacturers, but you won't see many of their cars in the United States or the European Union. Both have recently imposed hefty tariffs on EVs made by Chinese companies. Keep reading for the latest news on the largest EV companies.\n\nImage Source: Getty Images\n\nLargest EV companies The largest EV companies\n\nCompanies 1-5 1. BYD\n\nHeadquarters: China\n\nChina Founded: 1995\n\n1995 EVs manufactured in 2023: 3,014,692 (1,572,983 BEVs, 1,441,709 PHEVs) Chinese conglomerate BYD Company (OTC:BYDDY), which is short for \"Build Your Dreams,\" is the global leader in EV manufacturing. It produces personal and commercial EVs, as well as monorail systems and mobile phone components. BYD took the top spot on this list in 2022, when it (and other Chinese automakers) ramped up EV production. While it doesn't have any U.S. factories, BYD has plans for global expansion. It announced plans for its first European production factory, in Hungary, at the end of 2023. BYD's most popular line of vehicles is its Dynasty Series, which is named after China's imperial dynasties. Models include the BYD Qin, at one point the best-selling EV in the world, and the automaker's flagship sedan, the BYD Han. 2. Tesla\n\nHeadquarters: United States\n\nUnited States Founded: 2003\n\n2003 EVs manufactured in 2023: 1,811,088 (all BEVs) Auto manufacturer and clean energy company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) exploded onto the scene to become one of the world's largest companies in less than two decades. In 2021, it became just the sixth company to break a market cap of $1 trillion. Tesla's vehicles are extremely popular and have set multiple sales records. The Model 3 was the first EV to pass 1 million in global sales. In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the best-selling car worldwide, making it the first EV to hold that title. While Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning incorporated Tesla as Tesla Motors in 2003, the company is more closely associated with CEO Elon Musk. Musk first invested in the company in 2004, becoming the largest shareholder and chairman of the board. He has served as CEO since 2008. 3. Volkswagen\n\nHeadquarters: Germany\n\nGermany Founded: 1937\n\n1937 EVs manufactured in 2023: 1,010,263 (758,210 BEVs, 252,053 PHEVs) German auto giant Volkswagen (FRA:VOW) has a longer history with EVs than many people realize. It started developing EVs in 1970 through its Centre for Future Research led by Dr. Adolf Kalberlah. The first all-electric Volkswagen was called the Elektro Transporter, with a range of 43.5 miles and a 10-hour charge time. While Volkswagen experimented with EVs for decades, it announced in 2017 that it was making them a focus for the consumer market. The ID. series is its current EV lineup, including the ID.3 hatchback, the ID.4 crossover SUV, and the ID.7 sedan. 4. General Motors\n\nHeadquarters: United States\n\nUnited States Founded: 1908\n\n1908 EVs manufactured in 2023: 659,954 (641,162 BEVs, 18,792 PHEVs) General Motors (NYSE:GM) dipped its toe in the EV world in the 1990s when it produced the General Motors EV1. It was the first modern EV from a major manufacturer, and it was only available through lease agreements. Although it was popular with drivers, General Motors didn't expect EVs to be profitable, so it discontinued the program and destroyed most of the EVs. What a difference a few decades makes, since General Motors is now one of the top-five largest EV companies in the world. It has also announced plans to exclusively offer EVs and end production of its gas- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2035. General Motors has launched (or announced plans to launch) EVs across all its core auto brands (Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac). Its most popular so far has been the Chevrolet Bolt, but it's being phased out to transition to new EV models. 5. Stellantis\n\nHeadquarters: Netherlands\n\nNetherlands Founded: 2021\n\n2021 EVs manufactured in 2023: 654,438 (348,422 BEVs, 48 fuel cell EVs [FCEVs], 305,968 PHEVs) The youngest automaker on this list, Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), came about from a merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group. This company's auto brands include Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, and Jeep. While Stellantis was slower than other automakers to prioritize electrification, it's quickly catching up. It has set targets of 100% of its sales in Europe and 50% of its sales in the U.S. to be BEVs by the end of the decade, and it's aiming for 5 million in annual global BEV sales by 2030. This vehicle company's growing EV lineup has contributed to impressive year-over-year growth. Its global BEV sales increased by 21% in 2023, and it was No. 1 in the United States for PHEV sales. Its EVs are also highly popular in Europe -- the Fiat 500e is one of Italy's best-selling EVs, and the Peugeot e-208 was the most-sold EV in France during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nCompanies 6-10 6. Geely Auto Group\n\nHeadquarters: China\n\nChina Founded: 1986\n\n1986 EVs manufactured in 2023: 599,445 (420,480 BEVs, 178,965 PHEVs) One of the largest Chinese automobile manufacturers, Geely (OTC:GELYF), saw its EV sales grow by 21% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2024. Geely controls quite a few auto brands around the world, with Volvo likely being the most recognizable in the U.S. Owning Volvo puts Geely in an advantageous position. Because Volvo has U.S. manufacturing operations, it can sell EVs that are made in China, including the EX30, while avoiding the hefty tariffs normally charged on Chinese EV exports. Geely has multiple EV-only brands, including luxury EV brand Zeekr and Swedish Polestar. Geely Auto offers entry-level EVs through its Geometry product line and upscale hybrids and EVs through its Geely Galaxy brand. 7. BMW\n\nHeadquarters: Germany\n\nGermany Founded: 1916\n\n1916 EVs manufactured in 2023: 562,921 (378,722 BEVs, 151 FCEVs, 184,048 PHEVs) Luxury vehicle manufacturer BMW Group (OTC:BMWYY) started researching EVs in 1969. Its first EV was the BMW 1602 Electric, which could reach speeds of 100 kilometers per hour and had a maximum range of about 60 kilometers. Two of these cars were used as support and camera cars during the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. The BMW brand has several EVs in its lineup, including the compact executive i4, the i7 sedan, and the iX crossover SUV. Among its other brands, Mini has already launched EVs, and Rolls-Royce is currently working on its first EV, the Rolls-Royce Spectre. BMW Group is projecting that its share of EVs in total vehicle deliveries could exceed 30% by as early as 2025. It has also set a goal of delivering 10 million EVs to customers in total by 2030. 8. Hyundai Motors\n\nHeadquarters: South Korea\n\nSouth Korea Founded: 1967\n\n1967 EVs manufactured in 2023: 552,203 (418,632 BEVs, 4,868 FCEVs, 128,703 PHEVs) Hyundai Motors (FRA:HYU) was the third-largest automobile manufacturer in the world by sales in 2022, and it came in eighth for EVs manufactured. Its top two brands are Hyundai Motor Company and Kia. It also has a luxury division, Genesis Motors, and an EV subbrand called Ioniq, which launched in 2020. The company has set a goal of being a top-three EV manufacturer by 2030. In March 2024, it announced an investment of 68 trillion South Korean won (about $50.5 billion) in South Korea, part of which will go toward building three new EV factories. 9. GAC\n\nHeadquarters: China\n\nChina Founded: 1954\n\n1954 EVs manufactured in 2023: 524,501 (499,495 EVs, 25,006 PHEVs) Guangzhou Automobile Group (OTC:GNZUF), also known as GAC, is China's third-largest EV manufacturer. Its EV arm, GAC Aion, has seen significant sales growth, going from 271,156 vehicles sold in 2022 to 480,003 vehicles sold in 2023. It didn't quite reach its target of 500,000 units sold, but it was close, and it still grew sales by 77%. Like most Chinese automakers, GAC hasn't been able to break into the U.S. market yet. It doesn't produce or sell EVs in the United States. It has expanded into North America, though, as EVs from its Aion brand are now available in Mexico. 10. Mercedes-Benz\n\nHeadquarters: Germany\n\nGermany Founded: 1925\n\n1925 EVs manufactured in 2023: 405,065 (244,149 BEVs, 160,916 PHEVs) Mercedes-Benz Group (OTC:MBGY.Y) has long been one of the major luxury automakers, and now it's aiming to be the most desirable luxury EV brand. The company has pledged to go all-electric by 2030. However, it has clarified that it will do that where market conditions allow, meaning it could possibly continue selling gas-powered vehicles in countries with limited EV demand. Even though its EV sales have grown, they're still far behind the German automakers' targets. So in early 2024, it tempered expectations, stating that it would likely continue selling gas-powered vehicles well into the 2030s. Mercedes-Benz isn't the only car company to deal with slower EV sales recently. On a positive note, it's developing a global high-power charging network across key markets, with plans to have over 2,000 by the end of the decade.\n\nGlobal EV sales Global EV sales EV sales and their share of total vehicle sales worldwide have grown rapidly in recent years. Since 2020, global EV sales have increased by about 3.6 million per year, and EV sales share is more than 4 times higher. Projections by the International Energy Agency anticipate growth accelerating rapidly over the next decade.\n\nData source: International Energy Agency. Sales and sales share data for 2025, 2030, and 2035 are projections based on the STEPS scenario. Year EV sales EV sales share 2020 2,980,000 4.2% 2021 6,600,000 8.9% 2022 10,200,000 14.0% 2023 13,800,000 18.0% 2025* 20,800,000 25.0% 2030* 40,700,000 44.0% 2035* 56,500,000 55.0%\n\nChina is the worldwide leader for EV sales and sales share, and it's not a particularly close race. It had 8.1 million EVs sold last year, 38.0% of its total vehicle sales. The United States is currently lagging behind not just China but also Europe in its EV numbers. The difference in sales is understandable -- Europe and especially China both have larger population sizes. But the United States also has a far smaller EV sales share.\n\nData source: International Energy Agency. Sales and sales share data for 2025, 2030, and 2035 are projections based on the STEPS scenario. Year U.S. EV sales U.S. EV sales share China EV sales China EV sales share Europe EV sales Europe EV sales share 2020 294,000 2.3% 1,140,000 5.7% 1,400,000 10.0% 2021 630,000 4.7% 3,250,000 16.0% 2,300,000 17.0% 2022 990,000 7.4% 5,900,000 29.0% 2,700,000 20.0% 2023 1,390,000 9.5% 8,100,000 38.0% 3,300,000 21.0% 2025* 3,060,000 20.0% 11,000,000 49.0% 4,800,000 31.0% 2030* 8,800,000 55.0% 17,900,000 68.0% 9,200,000 60.0% 2035* 11,200,000 71.0% 22,100,000 85.0% 13,620,000 87.0%\n\nAverage EV prices Average EV prices Drivers pay a premium for EVs, at least in terms of the up-front price. The average transaction price for electric cars was $55,242 in April 2024, according to Cox Automotive data. For gas-powered vehicles, it was $44,989. While there's still a difference, the price gap between conventional and electric cars is shrinking. In the United States, it decreased from 80% in 2018 to 59% in 2022. China has eliminated the \"electric premium,\" as its EVs were 14% cheaper than its conventional cars as of 2022.\n\nData source: International Energy Agency. Country EV price premium (2018) EV price premium (2022) United States 80% 59% China 16% (14%) France 37% 39% Germany 7% 14% United Kingdom 71% 44%\n\nInvesting in EV companies How to invest in EV companies The world is moving more and more toward EVs. Many automakers have pledged that they're going all-electric. The federal government and more than 15 states offer EV incentives such as tax credits and rebates. Perhaps most importantly, EVs make up a growing share of total vehicles sold each year. If you're interested in investing in EV companies, you have several options, including: Investing in automotive stocks with strong EV divisions. At this point, there's quite a bit of overlap between the top automakers and the largest EV companies. You'll get at least some exposure to the EV market by investing in any major automaker, but you can also look for those that have pledged to go all-electric or have successful EV lineups.\n\nAt this point, there's quite a bit of overlap between the top automakers and the largest EV companies.

            "article_content": "Machine learning played a prominent role at Amazon Web Services' (AWS) annual in-house exhibition re:Invent \u2013, including when it comes to new hardware. The focus was on the EC2 UltraServers powered by Trainium2 chips and EC2 instances, which are now available. According to AWS, the new Trn2 instances offer 20.8 petaflops of computing power per instance and an up to 40 percent better price-performance ratio compared to the GPU-based EC2 P5 instances.\n\nAnzeige\n\nA Trn2 UltraServer consists of four Trn2 instances that are connected to each other via a NeuronLink connection. This architecture is designed to scale computing power up to 83.2 petaflops to reduce training and inference times for the world's largest AI models. Models with up to one trillion parameters could thus be processed with improved latency.\n\n\"Project Rainier\" for AI clusters\n\nAWS also announced \"Project Rainier\", which combines hundreds of Trainium2 UltraServers into an EC2 UltraCluster, enabling an increase in cluster size compared to existing solutions. These UltraClusters are used in organizations such as Anthropic to train AI models. Anthropic uses them, for example, to optimize Claude models for Amazon Bedrock on Trainium2. This infrastructure should enable customers to efficiently train models with trillions of parameters and use them in real time.\n\nRead also Amazon releases new AI model family \u2013 Nova\n\nAWS emphasized that it is not enough to increase the size of clusters to improve performance. Instead, the new architecture of Trainium2 UltraServers improves data distribution and resource allocation. This reduces the overall training time without encountering traditional network limits.\n\nNew instances with Nvidia Blackwell and outlook\n\nIn addition to the Trainium2 solutions, AWS presented the EC2 P6 instances. They are based on the next generation of Blackwell GPUs from Nvidia. Compared to the current generation, AWS promises up to 2.5 times higher performance and optimization specifically for compute-intensive generative AI applications. AWS sees the P6 instances primarily for applications that require fast response times and high scalability.\n\nAnzeige\n\nAWS has also already announced the upcoming Trainium3 chip as the successor to Trainium2. This will be manufactured using a 3-nanometer process. Compared to its predecessor, it is said to be more energy-efficient and four times more powerful. This will allow customers to iterate models faster and use them in real time. Trainium3 is expected to be available in later versions of the UltraServer.\n\n(nie)"

            "article_content": "We have only one example of biology forming in the universe \u2013 life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don\u2019t know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI\u2019m an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I\u2019ve learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there\u2019s advanced alien life out there, I\u2019m on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2013 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it\u2019s a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don\u2019t agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \u201cself-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\u201d That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet\u2019s atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA\u2019s definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2013 biological or not \u2013 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism\u2019s genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life\u2019s essential molecules \u2013 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they\u2019re unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they\u2019ll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nRead More: NASA report finds no evidence that UFOs are extraterrestrial\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth\u2019s crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that\u2019s for life as we know it \u2013 for life as we don\u2019t know it, all bets are off."

            "article_content": "At the heart of this cosmic mystery lies the Higgs field, a fundamental component of our universe that gives particles their mass. However, this field isn\u2019t as stable as we once thought. Scientists have discovered that the Higgs field could potentially \u201cbubble,\u201d creating pockets of altered reality where nothing could exist.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher, Lucien Heurtier, explains : \u201cThe Higgs field isn\u2019t likely to be in the lowest possible energy state it could be in. That means it could theoretically change its state, dropping to a lower energy state in a certain location.\u201d\n\nThis revelation has profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos. If the Higgs field were to shift to a lower energy state, it would dramatically alter the laws of physics within these \u201cbubbles.\u201d In such an environment :\n\nElectron masses would suddenly change\n\nParticle interactions would be altered\n\nProtons and neutrons would disintegrate\n\nLife as we know it would cease to exist\n\nThe paradox deepens when we consider the early universe and the hypothetical existence of primordial black holes. These minuscule black holes, potentially as small as a gram, are believed to have formed during the universe\u2019s inflationary period, mere moments after the Big Bang.\n\nPrimordial black holes : the universe\u2019s self-destruct button ?\n\nThe research team argues that if primordial black holes existed as current models suggest, they should have triggered widespread \u201cbubbling\u201d of the Higgs field. This cosmic chain reaction would have prevented the formation of any stable matter in the universe. Yet, here we are, contemplating our own existence.\n\nThis paradox presents scientists with two possible explanations :\n\nOur current models of primordial black holes are incorrect and need to be discarded There are fundamental aspects of the Higgs field\u2019s behavior that we don\u2019t yet understand\n\nThe implications of this study extend far beyond theoretical physics. It challenges our understanding of the universe\u2019s origins and stability, forcing us to reconsider established theories. This paradox is reminiscent of other unexpected discoveries that have baffled astronomers, pushing the boundaries of our cosmic knowledge.\n\nUnraveling the cosmic tapestry : new frontiers in physics\n\nAs scientists grapple with this existential paradox, new avenues of research are emerging. The quest to understand the universe\u2019s existence has led to innovative experiments and theoretical frameworks. One such breakthrough is the quantum cat experiment that set a record by surviving 1,400 seconds, pushing the boundaries of quantum superposition.\n\nThese advancements in quantum physics may hold the key to unraveling the Higgs field mystery. By exploring the behavior of particles at the quantum level, scientists hope to gain insights into the stability of the Higgs field and its interactions with other cosmic phenomena.\n\nThe study of cosmic paradoxes extends beyond the realm of physics. Recent research has even challenged our understanding of what happens in the brain after death, defying all logic. These discoveries highlight the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines and the need for a holistic approach to understanding our universe.\n\nRedefining reality : the impact on scientific thought\n\nThe revelation that the universe shouldn\u2019t exist according to current models has profound implications for scientific thought. It challenges researchers to question established theories and explore new paradigms. This shift in thinking could lead to revolutionary discoveries across various fields, from astrophysics to quantum mechanics.\n\nTo illustrate the potential impact of this paradigm shift, consider the following table :\n\nScientific Field Current Understanding Potential Paradigm Shift Cosmology Big Bang Theory Multi-dimensional universe models Particle Physics Standard Model Unified field theories Quantum Mechanics Copenhagen Interpretation Many-worlds interpretation Astrophysics Dark Matter/Energy Modified gravity theories\n\nAs scientists continue to probe the mysteries of the universe, unexpected discoveries are reshaping our understanding of reality. From new types of materials that could change our lives to fundamental questions about existence itself, the frontiers of science are expanding rapidly.\n\nThe paradox of the universe\u2019s existence serves as a humbling reminder of how much we have yet to learn. It invites us to embrace uncertainty, question our assumptions, and continue exploring the cosmic tapestry that surrounds us. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the Higgs field and primordial black holes, we may uncover truths that reshape our understanding of reality itself."

ToW, which is a part of the foundation set up by Anil Pradhan, a civil engineer, currently operates in Odisha and Telangana.\"Once children are exposed to advanced topics, only then will they be able to think big,\" feels Nihar, who said there were no such facilities in his childhood.Among the practical projects exposing rural children to science are satellite launch, 3D printing and town planning, among others. At least 1,200 students from Satyananda High School, Radhanath Bidyapith, Radhanath ME School, all in Soro, Maudamani High School and Banka Bihari Nodal ME School in Barahapur, and Gopinath High School, Kudei. \"The project was easy to implement as we got a cluster of schools within a 5-km radius,\" said Nihar.For the children, the vehicles are a big attraction as they are being taught in stages. \"First, we had an introductory class and teachers in the vehicle explained about electricity and cleared our doubts,\" said Archana Jena, a Class IX student of Gopinath Govt High School.In-charge headmistress, Laxmi Kumari Agarwal, said children don't have to memorise science concepts as the teachers on the vehicles are explaining it to them. \"Also, the school does not have to spend on such infrastructure. Children are happy that they are getting practical knowledge, and many want to participate,\" said Agarwal.A finale will be held later this month in which children will demonstrate a science project made by them. \"After coming to know about the tinker vehicles, more schools in the locality want to participate. I am planning to expand the initiative before the finale,\" said Nihar."
