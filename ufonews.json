        "article_content": "Alien Corridors - The Falkirk Triangle - Tony McMahon - expert - from episode HANDOUT\n\nBonnybridge, a serene Scottish village, has catapulted to fame as one of the globe's leading UFO hotspots, boasting some 300 sightings each year\u2014notably outpacing well-known extraterrestrial haunts like Area 51 or Roswell. Nestled within what's been aptly named the Falkirk Triangle and often referred to as Scotland's own Roswell, this location is awash with eerie tales from alien abductions to bizarre spacecraft sightings, fuelling talk that it could be a portal to another dimension. UFO aficionados and even government entities have been drawn in by the growing conspiracy theories, with calls for action reaching the ears of four Prime Ministers. One particular chilling episode from 1992 saw buddies Garry Wood and Colin Wright alleging a harrowing captivity by aliens aboard a space vessel as they journeyed near Tarbrax in South Lanarkshire. Around 10pm, they witnessed an ominous \"black\" object suspended in the skies, uniquely unlit yet distinct with a round base and trio of segments measuring some 30ft across. \"I have been doing this job for 45 years. I honestly believe that somewhere in the skies of this planet we are dealing with non-human intelligence,\" claims Malcolm Robinson, a seasoned UFO investigator, who further contends that agencies such as NASA, the American government, and the Pentagon are all delving into these otherworldly encounters. These baffling events are given centre stage in a novel documentary series broadcast on Blaze, where specialists globally endeavour to fathom the extraordinary concentration of UFO activity within the so-called Falkirk Triangle, positioned over the Scottish cities of Falkirk, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, reports the Mirror. The friends reportedly blacked out for what they believe was 10-15 seconds, only to regain consciousness with their car facing the opposite direction and an hour of time inexplicably lost. The incident, which has since been dubbed the \"A70 incident\", is documented in a two-page report found within secret government \"X-files\" and was sent to the Ministry of Defence's UFO desk in 1996, four years after the encounter took place.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the MoD's UFO Unit was swamped with reports of mysterious sightings within the Falkirk Triangle\n\nThe report, titled \"Unexplained Aerial Sighting,\" is based on evidence provided by Mr Wood, who at the time was a 33-year-old ambulance technician from Edinburgh. Malcolm Robinson, a paranormal investigator, stated: \"Days after the incident, both men found scars on their bodies that weren't there before. Their wives refused to believe them, their colleagues at work refused to believe them.\" After researching paranormal experiences in the local library, they contacted Malcolm, who suggested they undergo hypnosis - the results were astonishing. Recalling the incident in 1996, Garry said: \"I saw three creatures coming towards my car. I felt intense pain, like an electric shock. Then I was in some room. I saw these things like wee men moving about, doing something to me. I could only see up. Then this 6ft creature approached.\" He described the creature as being \"white-grey in colour with a large head and dark eyes with a long, slender neck, very slim shoulders and waist. There were either ribs or folds of skin on its body. The arms were like ours, but there were four very long fingers.\" During the 1990s, the MoD's UFO Unit was swamped with reports of mysterious sightings within the Falkirk Triangle, sparking a public frenzy. Enormous meetings were convened as locals and UFO witnesses packed out venues, clamouring for explanations. Local councillor Billy Buchanan and Malcolm Robinson tirelessly campaigned for a parliamentary probe, knocking on Downing Street's door four times to present their case to John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and Rishi Sunak, all without success. \"We are demanding that the British government open up an inquiry into UFO sightings in Scotland,\" insists Malcolm.\n\nCrop circle's are believed to be imprints from aliens\n\n\"We are happy to turn over our files and photographs. But I doubt anything will happen, they are too stuck in their ways.\" \"They say that as these objects do not pose any threat to the security of the UK, the British Government will not open up any enquiries.\" In a chilling encounter from 1979, WWII veteran Bob Taylor, who participated in the liberation of Bergen Belsen, ventured into Dechmont Law woods in search of stray livestock. There, he stumbled upon a 'flying dome', a large sphere hovering just above the ground, dark and metallic with a sandpaper-like texture and equipped with small propellers. From this daunting object, smaller spheres dropped and rolled towards him, dragging him inexorably towards the enigmatic craft. Bob's last memory was of a peculiar burning smell and a swishing noise before everything turned pitch black. When he regained consciousness, he found himself unable to drive and decided to walk back to his home in Livingston. Upon reaching home, he broke down and told his wife about the attack he had suffered. Bob appeared dishevelled and beaten, with his trousers completely torn.\n\nTrending\n\nThe authorities who arrived at the scene noted indentations on the ground. The investigation concluded that Bob had been subjected to an unusually brutal attack, but it remained unclear by whom or what. The police eventually categorised it as an assault by an unidentified person or persons, putting the report on hold until more evidence could be gathered. Some experts speculated that Bob might have been struck by lightning or experienced a seizure. Throughout the investigations, Bob, described as an honest and reliable man of good character, stuck to his story until his death in 2007. Historian Tony McMahon, who has been researching the sightings, questions why witnesses would expose themselves to ridicule unless they genuinely believed they had encountered extraterrestrials. \"Those involved were seen as reputable figures, not as flakes,\" he says. \"These were completely normal people who had this absolutely bizarre experience.\" \"I think the fact that it has recurred in that area is fascinating.\" \"In the case of the Falkirk Triangle we are dealing with people who are seen as pillars of the community and what happened to them was quite traumatic.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nA small town with over 300 sightings and fearful locals\n\n\"You can't see an upside to making it up. I think these people genuinely believed that they saw what they reported.\" The mystifying Falkirk Triangle has been touted as one of Britain's UFO hotspots, with some claiming that the veil between worlds is especially thin there, offering a gateway to other dimensions. Others postulate the presence of an interstellar pathway threading through the area, positioning it as a prime cosmic rest stop. While archaeologist Natasha Billson views such claims with a healthy dose of skepticism, she can't help but note the correlation between UFO sightings and areas rich in archaeological heritage. \"When it comes to UFO sightings a lot of them are near to archaeological sites, such as Stonehenge,\" she observes. Moreover, Scotland hosts the most extensive network of stone circles across the British Isles. In contrast, Tony McMahon draws our attention to the triangle's proximity to two military air bases, less than 50 miles away, and its nearness to major airports like Glasgow and Edinburgh. He suggestively points out: \"There are two ways of looking at that. One is that what is happening on those military sites is misconstrued as UFO activity, everything from weather balloons to flares - even to cutting edge technology that the Government would rather you didn't know about. There is a perfectly good case to be made for that.\"\n\nNatasha Billson is sceptical\n\n\"Equally, there is an argument that if we are being watched by aliens, by extraterrestrials, there is every reason to suspect that they would take a particular interest in military installations.\" \"Some people say maybe they are taking an interest in military installations because they want to knock us out, invade, colonise us. But there is another argument put forward that they are taking an interest because they are protecting us from ourselves.\" \"There's even an argument that alien technology has been shared with us, but the aliens won't share any more, because we keep misusing it against each other. Somebody wrote that after Hiroshima and Nagasaki the aliens decided that was more than enough.\""

An eagle-eyed mariner was able to capture it on film - seemingly leaving the minds behind the new series at a loss.\n\nFootage filmed by an expedition commissioned by Netflix's Investigation Alien appears to show an unidentified flying aircraft descending into the English Channel\n\nThe brief clip appears to show an unidentified 'flying' object transforming into an unidentified 'submerged' object in real-time, experts said\n\n'[This was] with everybody sleeping, with the exception of our night watch guy,' underwater archaeologist Rory Kremer tells Knapp of the clip, which appears to an unidentified 'flying' object transforming into an unidentified 'submerged' object in real-time\n\n'Don't tell me it's going to go in the water,' Knapp says in response, as the orb descends.\n\n'I'll be damned,' he adds after it happens, showing real confusion.\n\nThe series' main investigator and narrator, Knapp proceeds to ask for Kremer's professional opinion.\n\nThe archaeologist with over 20 years of experience admits he is equally stumped, despite his crew being the ones to capture the clip,\n\n'So this is what it does when it thinks that nobody is watching?' Knapp asks before turning to Kremer. 'Have you ever seen anything like this?'\n\n'A willy peter flare is the only thing I know like that that will hang up in the air, but that's not a flare, because there's no smoke going off of it,' the archaeologist says, admitting he has no real answers - at least ones that involve human technology.\n\n'Look at that. It's under the water,' he goes on to exclaim, conceding to Knapp he does not know the craft's nature.\n\nUnderwater archaeologist Rory Kremer is seen speaking about the footage his crew caught off the Channel Islands with journalist and ufologist George Knapp, the series' main investigator\n\n'I don't got any answers - do you?' he asks - leaving Knapp to posit that it could be evidence of a subterranean base.\n\n'You think it's got a base down there?' Knapp asks his friend.\n\n'It could be. It could be.'\n\nThe two begin to speak about previous sightings in the region, which stretch back hundreds of years.\n\n'Archaeology is your thing,' Knapp asks Kremer at this point. 'What do you think?'\n\nKremer responds by pointing to the native tribes that once inhabited the region - and their tales of unknown objects flying.\n\n'All have oral histories of lights they cannot explain,' the expert said, telling Knapp how these sightings off the Channel Islands were 'usually attributed it to gods.'\n\n'It has gone on a long time,' he continued, before touting the clip's importance.\n\n'Archaeology is your thing,' Knapp asks Kremer at this point. 'What do you think?' Kremer responds by pointing to the native tribes that once inhabited the region - and their tales of unknown objects flying.\n\n'I think we really scratched the surface here. There could very well be something underwater.'\n\nKnapp, in a narration provided after the exchanged, agreed.\n\nPointing to previous reports of undersea anomalies seen skirting the skies as well, he accused the government of keeping similar evidence under wraps, despite them likely being extraterrestrial in natured.\n\n'I'm going to share this with some insiders I know [to] hopefully get more videos like this released to the public, to get to the bottom of what non human intelligence might be doing in our oceans,' Knapp said of the footage, which has yet to be released to the public.\n\n'This is not us. It's from somewhere else,' he maintained.\n\nThe video, meanwhile, does not show the unidentified craft exiting the water after seemingly lowering in.\n\nInvestigation Alien - a 'paranormal docuseries [where] renowned UFO reporter [Knapp] investigates new evidence, interviews an array of experts and meets with emerging witnesses who are finally willing to go on the record' - released Friday.\n\nIt's now streaming on Netflix."

        "article_content": "Pixel Studio: Everything you need to know\n\nGoogle's newest phones, the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, come with new exclusive AI features. Some people think they're fun or useful, while others think we're entering the era of AI bloatware. An AI image generation app called Pixel Studio is one of those new features. It doesn't compete with popular AI image generators like Midjourney, but it's free and on your phone, so it's worth checking out.\n\nIf you own one of the best Pixel phones, Pixel Studio can be a fun tool to create AI-generated art. If you're beginning to learn how to prompt AI, you might feel frustrated when your prompt fails to produce what you intended. We cover how to use Pixel Studio and a basic primer on good prompting techniques. The app is currently available in limited countries: the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, India, Ireland, Singapore, and Malaysia.\n\nPixel Studio uses both on-device and cloud-based AI models\n\nPixel Studio is a standalone text-to-image app that offers on-device AI image generation and editing. It uses a text-to-image AI model running on the Tensor G4 processor and Google's cloud-based Imagen 3 image generation model. It requires an internet connection.\n\nYou're prompted to download the Pixel Studio AI model when you first open the app. This download can take some time, depending on your internet speed.\n\nImagen 3 is Google's newest and highest-quality text-to-image model, an improvement over Imagen 2. The model generates images with better detail and lighting while reducing most of the noticeable AI artifacts in previous versions. It generates relatively good photorealistic images and handles in-image text effectively.\n\nPixel Studio is still working on the ability to create and edit human images, even though it uses Imagen 3. Like Adobe's Firefly, there are heavy filters and restrictions. It may block some of your images from being generated even if there's nothing remotely suggestive in your prompt that is against the prohibited use policy. In those cases, the best you can do is adjust your prompt.\n\nHow to start creating AI images in Pixel Studio\n\nIt's fast and easy to create AI images in Pixel Studio. The style gallery lets you generate your images in a specific visual style, such as 3D, Sketch, or Anime. The AI image editing tools are limited to moving or erasing objects in a generated image or images you import from your photo gallery. You can change the look of your image by adding text and stickers.\n\nPixel Studio\n\nGoogle LLC\n\nTOOLS\n\nPrice: Free\n\n3\n\nDownload\n\nTo generate your image in Pixel Studio\n\nOpen your app launcher and open the Pixel Studio app. Tap Download to download the Pixel AI image generation model. To generate an image, tap Create at the bottom of the screen. Describe what you want in your image, and then tap the checkmark. Tap the Create button to start generating AI images Enter a description of the image and tap the checkmark Close If you're unsatisfied with the image, tap the regenerate icon in the lower-left corner. Tap the regenerate button to create a new image based on the current prompt Close To change the art style, tap the style icon to the right of the Regenerate icon.

Select a sticker to add to your image Add a caption to the generated image Close Tap the photo icon in the lower-left corner of the Pixel Studio home screen to edit existing photos in your gallery. Select the gallery icon to make changes to your images Close\n\nPrompting primer for AI image generation\n\nMainstream AI image generators like Pixel Studio are trained to understand natural language descriptions in their prompts. Although they have improved in a short time, an understanding of basic prompt components can be helpful.\n\nFoundational elements of a prompt\n\nFoundational aspects of a good prompt include descriptions of the Subject, the Action the subject is doing, the Environment the subject is in, and the Style of the image. This isn't a hard-and-fast rule. Instead, it's a good starting point when learning how to prompt.\n\nPart of the fun of prompting an image generator can be deliberately breaking this structure or leaving one of these foundational elements for the AI to decide. Familiarizing yourself with these elements helps you see how changes to those four components can affect the final image.\n\nSubject: The subject is the primary focus of the image you want to create. It can be a person, an animal, or an object. For example, let's use a cat as our subject.\n\nAction: The action refers to what the subject is doing in the image. Our cat could be sitting on a shelf, lying in the sun, playing with a ball of yarn, or performing another activity. Let's have our cat sitting on the table in this prompt.\n\nEnvironment: The environment is the setting where the subject performs the action. Our cat could be in the living room, a kitchen, or anywhere that you might find a surface a cat can lie down on. Let's keep things simple and place our cat sitting on a table in the kitchen.\n\nStyle: Visual styles like a cartoon, 3D render, anime, or flat art can be included in your prompt, even when you select a style from the style menu. You can combine styles, such as an oil painting, digital 3D art, or a paper cutout in an anime style. For this example, let's create the image in a cute cartoon style, or you can choose a preset style in the app.\n\nBasic image prompt example\n\nThis provides a foundational prompt: A cat sitting on the table in the kitchen in a cute cartoon style. While it may not sound interesting, these are the foundational elements. You can elaborate on them by describing the cat's appearance, adding environmental details like lighting or other objects, or describing the composition you want in the image.\n\nLet's elaborate on our foundational prompt: A black cat with fluffy fur sits on the table in a retro 50s-style kitchen, drawn in a cute cartoon style. The kitchen has natural light streaming in through the windows. The refrigerator, chairs, and cabinet are turquoise, while the stove and table are off-white. This gives each foundational element a unique description.\n\nWhen generating images with AI, the result may differ from what you describe, even with a good prompt. You can either generate more versions or adjust the wording to refine it.\n\nWe encourage you to start with a simple prompt like this and change one part of the description at a time to see how it affects the generated image. Swap out the black cat for an orange one, change the environment to a living room with a windowsill, or generate the image in a new visual style. Doing one thing at a time can teach you a lot. Have fun prompting.\n\nPixel Studio will improve over time\n\nThis is only the beginning for Pixel Studio. AI image generation has been improving so fast it's hard to keep up. Pixel Studio is fun, even though it isn't a powerhouse like Midjourney. For now, it seems to be marketed towards casual users. One thing for sure is that AI is going to be a big part of our future, so keep an eye out for our helpful prompting tips to make the most of it."

However, businesses are driven by profit, and while TSMC may not be able to resist US pressure, it will undoubtedly seek ways to preserve some flexibility and room for negotiation, Ma Jihua, a veteran telecom industry observer, told the Global Times on Sunday.Like many other chipmakers, it cannot afford to lose the mainland market, Ma said.In a statement sent to the Global Times on Sunday, TSMC said it is a law-abiding company and is committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.Citing an insider from TSMC, Taiwan island's local Economic Daily News reported on Friday that \"the company is currently discussing how to respond to the new US regulations.\" The report also quoted an anonymous industry source as saying that it is unlikely TSMC will suspend shipments of the relevant products at this time.TSMC hopes that the restrictions will only apply to mainland companies with products related to AI chips, without affecting other customers, such as those in the mobile chip sector, the local media reported.In fact, the US decoupling policy toward China has introduced significant uncertainty across the industry globally. While Washington pressures its so-called allies to decouple from China, the reality is that there has been considerable resistance.Peter Wennink, the former CEO of ASML, the world's leading lithography manufacturer based in the Netherlands, clearly stated in a media interview that the China accounts for 30 percent of its orders. Despite export restrictions, ASML will not abandon the market and will do everything possible to continue selling lithography machines to China, Sing Tao Daily reported in 2023.Even with full implementation of AI chip export restrictions to China, the impact on the country's AI development would be limited, Ma said, noting that leading high-tech companies in China have also built sufficient computing power reserves, and the country's AI industry remains at the forefront of the world.Chinese chip companies have made remarkable progress in recent years despite the ongoing US pressure, Ma said.In the first seven months, China's semiconductor exports totaled 640.91 billion yuan ($89.27 billion), a 25.8 percent year-on-year increase. Among key export categories, this was the second-highest growth rate, trailing only that of ships, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs.Meanwhile, China has steadily increased domestic production of semiconductors. In 2013, the ratio of domestic production to imports was 32.58 percent, but by the first half of 2024, this figure had risen to nearly 80 percent, highlighting a continuous rise in self-sufficiency and a significant boost in domestic production levels, domestic news site stcn.com reported in August."

(Christopher Dolan / Staff Photographer) Expand\n\nCARBONDALE \u2014 \u201cPeace, love, aliens.\u201d\n\nDuane and Denise Lindenmuth bore the motto on their T-shirts Saturday, specially made for the Carbondalien Festival, marking the 50th anniversary of an infamous incident near Russell Park in Carbondale that many believe was a UFO crash landing on Nov. 9, 1974.\n\nThe legend began when three teenage boys alerted police after witnessing a \u201cred, whirring ball\u201d fall from the sky and into a mine pond. The incident drew police, military and the curious to the city and concluded with a dive team pulling a battery-powered mine lantern from the pond, according to newspaper reports from that time.\n\nThe Lindenmuths traveled about two hours from Ambler with other family members, to participate in the festival, which drew hundreds of people to Main Street. Most were decked out in fluorescent green, some with extra eyes or antennae sprouting from their heads.\n\nSome of those attending were simply out for an afternoon of fun with family, while others are true believers in UFOs and other supernatural phenomena.\n\nAdrian and Maria Johnson, of Kingston, were among the latter. Both are familiar with the history of UFO sightings, including the Roswell incident in 1947, which many believe was the crashing of a UFO near the town in New Mexico.\n\nAdrian Johnson pointed out President Harry Truman addressed the possibility of UFOs with reporters in the early 1950s.\n\n\u201cWe believe,\u201d said Maria Johnson.\n\nSasha Podunajec, of Waymart, attended the event with her mother Diane Gallagher, Moscow; and son Rowan, age 3.\n\nGallagher said the event was a great opportunity for Carbondale to celebrate its history and host a robust community event.\n\nCandace and Thomas Deblasio moved to the area recently and heard about the event at a senior presentation last week.\n\nThe two went \u201call out,\u201d with Thomas decked in a green inflatable costume and Candace in shimmering silver and slanted glasses.\n\n\u201cThese weren\u2019t our Halloween costumes; we bought them especially for today,\u201d Candace Deblasio said, laughing.\n\nChana Manarchuck was part of the committee that organized the event and said it exceeded expectations of planners.\n\n\u201cI think we should have it every year,\u201d she said. \u201cMy motto is \u2018bloom where you\u2019re planted.\u2019 \u201c\n\nTodd Pousley, of NeighborWorks, said the event provided the chance to chat with residents and visitors about their vision for Carbondale.\n\nIt was also an opportunity to encourage people to complete a survey aimed at documenting their suggestions for Carbondale for future projects.\n\nBradford May, part of the event committee, said the event exceeded expectations.\n\nOriginally, when the event was scheduled for Nov. 9, there was a question about whether cold weather might interfere with attendees\u2019 enjoyment of the day.\n\nBut moderate temperatures and clear skies were the perfect setting for vendors who offered everything from good food to home goods and information.\n\nThe day included an immersive \u201cThe Russell Park Experience,\u201d with transportation to the park, which was sold out early in the day, as well as a citywide scavenger hunt and special speakers.\n\nIt concluded with an after-party event at the ballroom of the Hotel Anthracite featuring \u201cParanormal State\u201d star Heather Taddy."

        "article_content": "Alien Corridors - The Falkirk Triangle - Tony McMahon - expert - from episode HANDOUT\n\nBonnybridge, a serene Scottish village, has catapulted to fame as one of the globe's leading UFO hotspots, boasting some 300 sightings each year\u2014notably outpacing well-known extraterrestrial haunts like Area 51 or Roswell. Nestled within what's been aptly named the Falkirk Triangle and often referred to as Scotland's own Roswell, this location is awash with eerie tales from alien abductions to bizarre spacecraft sightings, fuelling talk that it could be a portal to another dimension. UFO aficionados and even government entities have been drawn in by the growing conspiracy theories, with calls for action reaching the ears of four Prime Ministers. One particular chilling episode from 1992 saw buddies Garry Wood and Colin Wright alleging a harrowing captivity by aliens aboard a space vessel as they journeyed near Tarbrax in South Lanarkshire. Around 10pm, they witnessed an ominous \"black\" object suspended in the skies, uniquely unlit yet distinct with a round base and trio of segments measuring some 30ft across. \"I have been doing this job for 45 years. I honestly believe that somewhere in the skies of this planet we are dealing with non-human intelligence,\" claims Malcolm Robinson, a seasoned UFO investigator, who further contends that agencies such as NASA, the American government, and the Pentagon are all delving into these otherworldly encounters. These baffling events are given centre stage in a novel documentary series broadcast on Blaze, where specialists globally endeavour to fathom the extraordinary concentration of UFO activity within the so-called Falkirk Triangle, positioned over the Scottish cities of Falkirk, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, reports the Mirror. The friends reportedly blacked out for what they believe was 10-15 seconds, only to regain consciousness with their car facing the opposite direction and an hour of time inexplicably lost. The incident, which has since been dubbed the \"A70 incident\", is documented in a two-page report found within secret government \"X-files\" and was sent to the Ministry of Defence's UFO desk in 1996, four years after the encounter took place.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the MoD's UFO Unit was swamped with reports of mysterious sightings within the Falkirk Triangle\n\nThe report, titled \"Unexplained Aerial Sighting,\" is based on evidence provided by Mr Wood, who at the time was a 33-year-old ambulance technician from Edinburgh. Malcolm Robinson, a paranormal investigator, stated: \"Days after the incident, both men found scars on their bodies that weren't there before. Their wives refused to believe them, their colleagues at work refused to believe them.\" After researching paranormal experiences in the local library, they contacted Malcolm, who suggested they undergo hypnosis - the results were astonishing. Recalling the incident in 1996, Garry said: \"I saw three creatures coming towards my car. I felt intense pain, like an electric shock. Then I was in some room. I saw these things like wee men moving about, doing something to me. I could only see up. Then this 6ft creature approached.\" He described the creature as being \"white-grey in colour with a large head and dark eyes with a long, slender neck, very slim shoulders and waist. There were either ribs or folds of skin on its body. The arms were like ours, but there were four very long fingers.\" During the 1990s, the MoD's UFO Unit was swamped with reports of mysterious sightings within the Falkirk Triangle, sparking a public frenzy. Enormous meetings were convened as locals and UFO witnesses packed out venues, clamouring for explanations. Local councillor Billy Buchanan and Malcolm Robinson tirelessly campaigned for a parliamentary probe, knocking on Downing Street's door four times to present their case to John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and Rishi Sunak, all without success. \"We are demanding that the British government open up an inquiry into UFO sightings in Scotland,\" insists Malcolm.\n\nCrop circle's are believed to be imprints from aliens\n\n\"We are happy to turn over our files and photographs. But I doubt anything will happen, they are too stuck in their ways.\" \"They say that as these objects do not pose any threat to the security of the UK, the British Government will not open up any enquiries.\" In a chilling encounter from 1979, WWII veteran Bob Taylor, who participated in the liberation of Bergen Belsen, ventured into Dechmont Law woods in search of stray livestock. There, he stumbled upon a 'flying dome', a large sphere hovering just above the ground, dark and metallic with a sandpaper-like texture and equipped with small propellers. From this daunting object, smaller spheres dropped and rolled towards him, dragging him inexorably towards the enigmatic craft. Bob's last memory was of a peculiar burning smell and a swishing noise before everything turned pitch black. When he regained consciousness, he found himself unable to drive and decided to walk back to his home in Livingston. Upon reaching home, he broke down and told his wife about the attack he had suffered. Bob appeared dishevelled and beaten, with his trousers completely torn.\n\nTrending\n\nThe authorities who arrived at the scene noted indentations on the ground. The investigation concluded that Bob had been subjected to an unusually brutal attack, but it remained unclear by whom or what. The police eventually categorised it as an assault by an unidentified person or persons, putting the report on hold until more evidence could be gathered. Some experts speculated that Bob might have been struck by lightning or experienced a seizure. Throughout the investigations, Bob, described as an honest and reliable man of good character, stuck to his story until his death in 2007. Historian Tony McMahon, who has been researching the sightings, questions why witnesses would expose themselves to ridicule unless they genuinely believed they had encountered extraterrestrials. \"Those involved were seen as reputable figures, not as flakes,\" he says. \"These were completely normal people who had this absolutely bizarre experience.\" \"I think the fact that it has recurred in that area is fascinating.\" \"In the case of the Falkirk Triangle we are dealing with people who are seen as pillars of the community and what happened to them was quite traumatic.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I think these people genuinely believed that they saw what they reported.\" The mystifying Falkirk Triangle has been touted as one of Britain's UFO hotspots, with some claiming that the veil between worlds is especially thin there, offering a gateway to other dimensions. Others postulate the presence of an interstellar pathway threading through the area, positioning it as a prime cosmic rest stop. While archaeologist Natasha Billson views such claims with a healthy dose of skepticism, she can't help but note the correlation between UFO sightings and areas rich in archaeological heritage. \"When it comes to UFO sightings a lot of them are near to archaeological sites, such as Stonehenge,\" she observes. Moreover, Scotland hosts the most extensive network of stone circles across the British Isles. In contrast, Tony McMahon draws our attention to the triangle's proximity to two military air bases, less than 50 miles away, and its nearness to major airports like Glasgow and Edinburgh. He suggestively points out: \"There are two ways of looking at that. One is that what is happening on those military sites is misconstrued as UFO activity, everything from weather balloons to flares - even to cutting edge technology that the Government would rather you didn't know about. There is a perfectly good case to be made for that.\"\n\nNatasha Billson is sceptical\n\n\"Equally, there is an argument that if we are being watched by aliens, by extraterrestrials, there is every reason to suspect that they would take a particular interest in military installations.\" \"Some people say maybe they are taking an interest in military installations because they want to knock us out, invade, colonise us. But there is another argument put forward that they are taking an interest because they are protecting us from ourselves.\" \"There's even an argument that alien technology has been shared with us, but the aliens won't share any more, because we keep misusing it against each other. Somebody wrote that after Hiroshima and Nagasaki the aliens decided that was more than enough.\""

        "article_content": "In addition to innovation in the analytical methods and laboratory equipment used for HTS, significant advances have also occurred in the software arena, most notably the integration of AI and ML for data analysis and improvements in cloud-based platforms for collaborative research.\n\nIn addition to advances in automation, innovation in miniaturization technologies is helping to improve HTS performance. \u201cBy shrinking assay volumes, miniaturized platforms like microfluidics and nanodispensing have allowed for higher throughput while reducing reagent consumption,\u201d Mahale remarks. Access to smaller-volume assays, he says, is especially useful in fragment-based drug discovery and the screening of complex biological samples, as it allows for cost-effective experiments with even larger libraries.\n\nMore specifically, automation accelerates workflows by allowing researchers to complete multiple tasks at once. \u201cThis kind of parallelization is especially helpful for processes like catalyst screening, ligand screening, or solvent selection. Automation also allows chemists to conduct experiments in high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, which are difficult to complete manually. With these features, automation makes experimentation in the lab more targeted and efficient, saving valuable time, energy, and cost,\u201d Schmidt notes.\n\nBy automating process development tasks, researchers can significantly accelerate the identification of optimal synthetic pathways and fine-tune processes for maximum efficiency, according to Schmidt. \u201cThis translates to faster development times, reduced errors, and more consistent API production. For drug developers, this means reduced risk and uncertainty in API development, enabling a greater focus on clinical trials and regulatory approvals,\u201d he contends.\n\nAutomated liquid-handling robots, says Mahale, have become faster, more accurate, and capable of working with extremely low volumes of reagents, enabling more cost-effective screening. \u201cAdvances in pipetting precision, multi-plate handling, and integration with other systems (like incubators, centrifuges, and imagers) have significantly reduced human error and improved reproducibility. Automated workflows for complex cell assays and readouts based on imaging analysis, meanwhile, allow multiple assays to be performed with minimal consumable cost and keeping sustainability in mind. Use of multimode plate readers in the automation workflow also allows for multiplex assays to maximize data collection,\u201d he details.\n\nSome of the biggest advances improving and expanding HTS for drug discovery and development relate to automation and miniaturization of laboratory systems. \u201cAutomation is transforming the landscape of API development and manufacturing,\u201d Schmidt states.\n\nOverall, Alderwick summarizes, these various innovations have improved the scalability, specificity, and throughput of HTS, enabling researchers to screen more diverse compound libraries and discover novel molecular mechanisms of action.\n\nCRISPR-based functional screening, meanwhile, is employed to elucidate the biological pathways involved in disease processes, according to Alderwick. CRISPR editing of genes for knock-out and knock-in experiments have greatly advanced assay designs for cell-based phenotypic HTS approaches, he explains. In addition, by selectively tagging proteins of interest, CRISPR is advancing the understanding of target engagement and functional effects of drug treatments. \u201cBy screening small molecules alongside CRISPR-modified cells, researchers can better understand drug-target interactions at a genomic level, enabling the selection of candidates with higher precision,\u201d says Alderwick.\n\nASMS screening is increasingly used to discover small molecules that engage a specific target, says Alderwick. \u201cHighly advanced ASMS platforms that use rapid workflows to quickly generate high-quality data are getting traction as HTS methods. The platform is amenable to a broad spectrum of targets, including proteins, complexes, and oligonucleotides such as RNA, and can be a leading assay to initiate drug discovery programs,\u201d he comments. Unlike traditional label-free approaches, which are often slow, restrictive, and not optimal for large screening campaigns, Alderwick adds that new solutions such as Charles River\u2019s SAMDI ASMS platform allow efficient investigation of protein-protein interactions, TPD, molecular glues, RNA binders, etc. in a high-throughput format.\n\nOne of the key advances in HTS for drug discovery and development is the adoption of a wider array of state-of-the-art analytical techniques for this application. The most notable technologies introduced recently as high-throughput platforms include affinity selection mass spectrometry (ASMS)-based screening platforms such as self-assembled monolayer desorption ionization (SAMDI), target protein degradation (TPD), and molecular glue platforms; and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based functional screening platforms, notes Luke Alderwick, senior group leader, Discovery Sciences with Charles River.\n\nOverall, using HTS during process development can, contends Schmidt, \u201chelp in the optimization and simplification of established workflows, integration of emerging technologies such as photochemistry and electrochemistry, and leveraging of rapidly evolving computational tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).\u201d\n\nDuring the early stages of candidate development, the synthetic pathway is still flexible, making HTS particularly valuable, according to Jens Schmidt, associate director of manufacturing, science, and technology at Lonza. \u201cHTS can help process development scientists rapidly evaluate the feasibility of different synthetic routes or optimal chemical combinations, such as solvents, catalysts, and bases,\u201d he explains. As the project advances through clinical phases, the flexibility in process steps decreases, but HTS remains useful for expanding the understanding of the process, such as its reaction kinetics.\n\n\u201cConsidering the vast number of technologies, each one of them serving a different purpose to address the scientific question, naturally different attributes, including binding affinities, reaction kinetics, enzymatic activity, functional activity, target engagement, selectivity, and specificity, are often analyzed. These attributes are critical because they provide early insights into the potential efficacy and selectivity of drug candidates, which is essential for optimizing pharmacological profiles,\u201d says Mahale. Given the wide range of technologies available, he also emphasizes the importance of selecting a fit-for-purpose technology to address each biological question.\n\nThe most widely used HTS technologies for identification of small-molecule API candidates include fluorescence-based, luminescence-based, and absorbance-based assays, according to Sachin Mahale, research leader, Discovery Sciences at Charles River. He adds that methods for detection of unlabeled biomolecules, such as those based on mass spectrometry, have also become more widely used at an HTS-scale in recent years, allowing the screening of compounds in both biochemical and cellular settings and thus expanding the breadth of targets to those that would otherwise be unscreenable. High-content imaging and automated electrophysiology are additional techniques providing multi-parametric cellular data that are becoming more widespread in high-throughput formats for discovery research, Mahale observes.\n\nHigh-throughput screening (HTS) enables the rapid testing of numerous compounds against biological targets. By automating and miniaturizing assays, HTS significantly accelerates the identification of potential drug candidates or optimal process conditions and can be applied throughout the entire development path of a potential drug, from discovery to process development. In the discovery phase, HTS is one of several hit-identification (Hit-ID) paradigms and involves the use of sensitive and miniaturized methods for screening large libraries of small molecules in a practical and efficient manner. During process development, HTS helps researchers rapidly establish an optimal synthetic route and conditions for each process step that reliably produce sufficient material quickly.\n\nNew AI algorithms can, observes Schmidt, analyze data from high-content screening systems, detecting complex patterns and trends that would otherwise be challenging for humans to identify. AI/ML algorithms can identify patterns and predict the activity of small-molecule candidates, even when the data are noisy or incomplete, Mahale adds. In addition to significantly speeding up the analysis of screening results and identifying promising leads faster and with higher accuracy, integration of AI into HTS processes can also improve assay optimization, he comments. Another key advantage of AI-driven HTS, according to Mahale, is its ability to adapt to new data in real time when compared to traditional HTS relying on pre-determined conditions.\n\n\u201cThese advances in AI and ML have been pivotal in accelerating drug discovery by improving both the quality of data and the efficiency of experimental processes. In the early stages of development, meanwhile, using these advanced solutions provides a holistic view that streamlines route scouting and accelerates the transition from research and development to robust manufacturing processes,\u201d Schmidt says. As an example, he points to Lonza\u2019s AI Route Scouting Service, which integrates proprietary commercial data with cutting-edge synthesis planning technology. \u201cThis innovation allows for more accurate and comprehensive analysis of cellular phenotypes, providing deeper insights into the efficacy and safety of drug candidates,\u201d he notes.\n\nCloud technology, meanwhile, has enhanced the ability to store, share, and analyze HTS data across multiple sites in real time, says Mahale. \u201cThe result is improved collaboration between research teams globally, reduced data redundancy, and increased application of machine learning models on large datasets,\u201d he explains.\n\nCombined, Mahale believes the various software innovations incorporated into HTS systems are enabling the handling of more complex datasets, improving prediction accuracy and streamlining the drug discovery pipeline.\n\nAddressing cost and complexity\n\nImplementing HTS for drug discovery and development is not a simple matter. The systems are both complex and costly. Fortunately, minimizing these issues has also been a focus of technology providers and end users.\n\nSchmidt points to significant advancements in standardization and simplification of workflows as helping to accelerate HTE experimentation timelines and reduce costs. Examples include the development of standardized protocols and data formats, which has simplified the implementation and operation of HTE assays, specifically improving their accessibility and accuracy. He also notes that software tools powered by AI have made it easier for researchers to design, execute, and analyze HTE experiments.\n\nAnother effective approach, according to Alderwick, is to leverage tailored compound libraries such as Charles River\u2019s Lead-Like Compound Library, which include compounds with lead-like properties and diversity and excludes problem chemotypes. The company\u2019s Fast-Track HTS offerings leverages this library to provide rapid hit discovery and lead identification while maintaining high-quality data outputs, he adds. \u201cWith a fixed-cost and streamlined program, this service is ideal for proof-of-concept studies and suits research groups or companies with limited funding because it allows for high-quality, early-stage screening without the need for extensive internal resources or infrastructure,\u201d Alderwick says.\n\nAlderwick also notes that modular systems in development offer the potential to customize HTS systems to the specific needs of a lab, which will further lower the initial capital investment required. \u201cAll of these advances are making HTS more cost-effective, scalable, and user-friendly, reducing barriers to entry for smaller research organizations,\u201d he concludes.\n\nFurther advances needed\n\nDespite the many remarkable advances made in HTS technologies for drug discovery and process development, significant challenges impacting both the efficiency of identifying optimal small-molecule candidates and processes, and their downstream success in clinical trials, remain.\n\nOne important issue, according to Schmidt, is the need to analyze large HTE datasets that require significant computational resources. \u201cThis can be a bottleneck for many drug developers, which is why partnering with a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) like Lonza can be helpful. CDMOs have the tools and technology, such as AI algorithms, to help drug developers analyze data and progress through development stages quickly,\u201d he says.\n\nThere are also challenges to handling very small amounts of solids, Schmidt notes. \u201cAlthough this may seem like a minor technical detail, understanding and accepting these limitations is crucial,\u201d he says. One potential solution highlighted by Schmidt is the use of solid supports such as ChemBeads (MilliporeSigma), small, chemical-coated glass beads created specifically for use in HTS applications.\n\nA primary challenge in HTS for drug discovery is identifying assays that are physiologically relevant to the disease state despite the need for simplification to ensure scalability and robustness, according to Mahale. Model systems do not always translate well. In addition, biochemical assays, while simpler, often fail to capture the nuances of cellular contexts, such as the impact of membrane permeability, metabolite production, or protein-protein interactions, while cell-based assays are closer to physiological reality but are more complex, expensive, and challenging to miniaturize.\n\n\u201cThe complexity of human diseases, particularly multifactorial diseases like cancer or neurodegenerative disorders, makes it difficult to develop assays that can recapitulate the true pathophysiology of the disease,\u201d Alderwick observes. \u201cPoor assay choice,\u201d he continues, \u201cleads to the identification of hits that might show promise in early testing but later fail due to lack of efficacy or off-target effects in more complex disease models or clinical settings. The incorrect assay not only risks identifying false positives but also misses out on potential therapeutic candidates that could have better real-world efficacy. This limitation significantly contributes to the high attrition rates in drug development.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge is the development of a robust screening cascade (primary, secondary, and tertiary screenings) that helps to identify, confirm, validate, and refine viable candidates and reduce the attrition rate during later stages of drug development. Further assays are then employed during lead optimization to assess toxicity, selectivity, functional activity, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics for further hit validation. \u201cFailures in designing an appropriate HTS cascade occur when these different stages are not sufficiently de-risked,\u201d contends Alderwick.\n\nWhile incorporating more predictive absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity screens early in the process has helped de-risk candidate selection to some degree, the challenge still lies in balancing the need for throughput and speed with the inclusion of more complex, multi-parametric data, according to Alderwick. \u201cEarly prediction of in vivo efficacy and safety in HTS remains a weak point, contributing to high failure rates in the transition from hit-to-lead and lead-to-clinical candidate stages,\u201d he concludes.\n\nFinally, Mahale notes that the selection of chemically diverse and high-quality libraries for HTS is pivotal in the success of small-molecule candidate identification, because even with the best assays, if the chemical library lacks diversity or contains unsuitable and non-drug-like compounds, the likelihood of finding optimal candidates diminishes. \u201cMany historical compound libraries are biased toward certain chemical scaffolds that have been repeatedly screened over decades, thus reducing the chances of discovering novel small molecules with new mechanisms of action,\u201d he observes. Charles River, Mahale adds, has tackled this issue by developing an expertly curated small-molecule compound library that covers a wide range of structural and functional diversity, thereby maximizing the probability of finding useful hits.\n\nEmerging strategies offer potential\n\nSeveral emerging strategies aim to improve the efficiency, reliability, and outcomes of HTS by leveraging advancements in technology, biology, and chemistry, according to Alderwick. Advances in organoid and 3D-cell culture technologies are helping to bridge the gap between simple in vitro assays and complex human disease biology, and thus address the need for more physiologically relevant assays, he observes. \u201cThese models better mimic the physiological conditions of tissues and organs, providing a more relevant system for screening potential drug candidates,\u201d Alderwick explains. Organoids derived from patient tissues, for example, can offer insights into how drugs might work in specific disease contexts, improving the predictive power of assays.\n\nTo shrink the gap between biochemical, cell-free assays and phenotypic, cell-based screens and thus better understand the on-target activity of identified hit molecules, including binding assays such as for target engagement and protein-protein interaction analysis in the HTS screening cascade, would greatly advance the ability to select optimal compounds for further development, believes Alderwick. He also notes that the use of advanced cellular models, such as CRISPR/Cas (CRISPR-associated protein) knockouts and induced pluripotent stem cells, for early screening is likely to improve HTS outcomes.\n\nContinued advances in automation and the use of AI and ML will further enable HTS platforms to handle more complex assays with higher precision, reproducibility, and throughput, according to Mahale. \u201cFully automated HTS systems can reduce human error, improve the consistency of assay conditions, and allow for more sophisticated workflows that balance throughput with data quality, while incorporation of AI/ML algorithms can reduce the rates of false readouts, making HTS more reliable and reducing the time spent following up on false positives,\u201d he says.\n\nUltimately, concludes Mahale, these emerging solutions aim to reduce the high attrition rates in drug discovery by improving the relevance and quality of the screening process, optimizing candidate selection, and expanding the chemical diversity available for exploration. \u201cWhile challenges remain, these developments promise to significantly enhance the utility of HTS in the drug development pipeline,\u201d he contends.\n\nExcitement around multi-omics approaches\n\nLooking beyond these strategies, Alderwick is excited about the trend toward integration of multi-omics approaches into HTS, which he says represent a major leap forward in the ability to identify optimal small-molecule API candidates. \u201cMulti-omics approaches leverage data from various molecular levels, including genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and even epigenomics, providing a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of how small molecules interact with entire biological networks and pathways rather than isolated targets,\u201d he explains. \u201cComplex diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndromes often involve multiple, interconnected biological systems, and thus multi-omics approaches have a greater likelihood of identifying effective new drug candidates,\u201d he states.\n\nPeople remain the key to success\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced drug manufacturing environment, HTS has become an indispensable tool. However, Schmidt emphasizes that advances in technology are not sufficient by themselves to enhance the performance of these platforms. \u201cLooking ahead, we can expect continued improvements in both reliability and simplicity, but the key to success lies in having a motivated, dedicated, and technically skilled team that is ready to embrace challenges and open to adopting innovative techniques,\u201d he insists.\n\nAbout the author\n\nCynthia A.

        "article_content": "The Detroit Lions' offense has been playing at a high level this season, partly thanks to the impressive campaign quarterback Jared Goff is having. Going into a Week 10 matchup against the Houston Texans, the Lions' offense is set to get even stronger with the return of wide receiver Jameson Williams.\n\nWilliams was forced to serve a two-game suspension after he violated the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances, which is why he hasn't played in a few weeks. However, the Alabama product is ready and raring to go for Sunday night.\n\nWhile Goff has been playing at an MVP level this season, that wasn't reflected in his fantasy numbers last week, as Goff threw for just 145 yards and one touchdowns, but the weather conditions were poor.\n\nAhead of an exciting matchup with another good team, should Williams and/or Goff be in your fantasy football lineup this week? Let's take a look.\n\nFantasy football start or sit Week 10: Jameson Williams\n\nThe only real concern for Williams this week is rust after not playing in the last two games, but that's not enough to suggest sitting him. In fact, it's possible the Lions try to feed him early and often to get him going.\n\nThe matchup is a good one, as the Texans are ceding the sixth-most fantasy points and the second-most touchdowns per game to wide receivers.\n\nWilliams is a strong WR2 play this week.\n\nVerdict: Start Williams\n\nFantasy football start or sit Week 10: Jared Goff\n\nThe problem with Goff on a weekly basis is the Lions love running the football; and who can blame them with the two talented running backs they have?\n\nBut this matchup against the Texans does offer an opportunity for Goff to put up a strong fantasy showing. Houston has given up the eighth-most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks\n\nGranted, Houston sports the third-best pass defense in the NFL currently, but the Texans have also faced a lackluster group of quarterbacks overall through nine games. We're not worried about Goff tonight.\n\nVerdict: Start Goff"

        "article_content": "One of the most anticipated new smartphones has been announced: the OnePlus 13. This device will eventually replace the highly regarded OnePlus 12, one of the year\u2019s top phones. How do these two models compare? If you own a OnePlus 12, should you consider upgrading to the newer version? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: specs\n\nOnePlus 13 OnePlus 12 Size 162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5 mm 164.3 x 75.8 x 9.2 mm (6.47 x 2.98 x 0.36 inches) Weight 210 grams 220 grams (7.76 ounces) Screen size and resolution 6.8-inch 1440p OLED with 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate 3168 x 1440 pixels at 510 pixels per inch 800 nits typical, 4,500 nits peak 6.82-inch LTPO AMOLED (Dynamic 1-120Hz) 3168 x 1440 resolution at 510 pixels per inch 600 nits typical, 4,500 nits peak Operating system Android with OxygenOS Android with OxygenOS Storage 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB 256GB, 512GB Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 RAM 12GB, 16GB, or 24GB 12GB or 16GB Cameras 50-megapixel main 50MP ultrawide 50MP 2X zoom Front: 32MP Rear: 50MP primary, 48MP ultrawide, and 64MP periscope telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom Front: 32MP Water resistance IP69 IP65 Battery 6,000mAh Fast charging 100W (TBA in the U.S.) Fast wireless charging (50W) Reverse wireless charging (10W) 5,400mAh Fast charging 100W (80W in the U.S.) Fast wireless charging (50W) Reverse wireless charging (10W) Colors White Dawn, Blue Moments, Obsidian Black Flowy Emerald, Silky Black Price TBA worldwide From $800 Review To be released OnePlus 12\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: design and display\n\nOnePlus is recognized for its innovative phone designs, evident in the OnePlus 13. While the new phone maintains the distinctive OnePlus identity, it introduces several noteworthy differences compared to the previous model. One significant change is the phone\u2019s flat sides, reminiscent of the Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy phones, and Google Pixel. This design contrasts with the OnePlus 12, which features curved sides, potentially offering improved grip. Additionally, the OnePlus 13 boasts a slightly slimmer and lighter body, and its IP69 rating indicates enhanced resistance to water and dust.\n\nThe differences in display between the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 12 are subtle but noteworthy. Both phones feature a 6.8-inch AMOLED display with a sharp 1440p resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, delivering vibrant colors and deep blacks.\n\nOne key improvement in the OnePlus 13 is its typical brightness, which reaches 800 nits, compared to 600 nits on the OnePlus 12. Additionally, the OnePlus 13 utilizes the newer BOE X2 OLED panel technology, promising enhanced visual quality. However, both models maintain the same peak brightness of 4,500 nits.\n\nRegarding protection, the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 12 are equipped with Gorilla Glass Victus 2. The OnePlus 13 also features an additional \u201ccrystal shield super-ceramic glass layer.\u201d\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: performance\n\nIt will be a while before we can try the OnePlus 13, but the specifications indicate that it will offer a significant performance boost over its predecessor.\n\nThe OnePlus 13 features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the OnePlus 12. This updated chipset has an Adreno GPU, which promises smoother gaming and faster graphics.\n\nEarly benchmarks from AnTuTu show that the OnePlus 13 delivers 58% better overall performance, while GeekBench 6 indicates a 36% improvement in single-core performance. This improvement should result in noticeable enhancements for everyday tasks and general usage.\n\nThe question remains: how much better performance can we expect on the new phone? The OnePlus 12 already demonstrated impressive capabilities during daily tasks such as checking email, browsing social media, and watching videos. With its dual cryo-velocity cooling system, it also excelled in handling graphically intensive gaming sessions without any issues. We can likely anticipate similar performance from the OnePlus 13, with even greater enhancements expected for the models equipped with 24GB of RAM.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: battery and charging\n\nAnother noticeable change made on the OnePlus 13 is its larger battery. Where the OnePlus 12 includes a 5,400mAh battery, the one on the OnePlus 13 is 6,000mAh. The larger battery capacity is thanks to silicon-carbon battery technology that allows for more energy storage in a smaller space. This should mean longer battery life, although that depends on what you\u2019re doing.\n\nDepending on your display settings and usage, the OnePlus 12 can probably last up to two full days on a single charge. When more intensive tasks are added to the mix, that drops to around a day of use between charges.\n\nThe OnePlus 13\u2019s larger battery capacity should allow it to outperform its successor, offering improved performance in demanding tasks, potentially better longevity since the battery will undergo fewer charging cycles, and more. Again, it\u2019s a little bit too early to determine just how much the improvements will be.\n\nOne area where you won\u2019t see a difference between the two phones is when it comes to actual charging. OnePlus did not enhance the charging speeds for wired or wireless charging. Like its predecessor, the OnePlus 13 supports 100W fast charging, 50W wireless charging, and reverse charging up to 10W. The OnePlus 12 was restricted to 80W charging speeds in the U.S. though, and it remains to be seen whether the OnePlus 13 echoes this limitation.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: cameras\n\nHistorically, the camera systems on OnePlus phones have been sound but often ranked below those of industry leaders like Samsung and Google. This trend began to shift in recent years, particularly following the company\u2019s strategic partnership with Hasselblad, which kicked off with the OnePlus 9 series. This collaboration aimed to elevate OnePlus\u2019 photographic capabilities by leveraging Hasselblad\u2019s expertise in color science and imaging technology. As a result, each subsequent release has demonstrated consistent improvements in camera performance and overall imaging quality.\n\nThe OnePlus 13 features an impressive triple-camera setup, each boasting a high-resolution 50-megapixel sensor. At its core is a state-of-the-art 50MP primary sensor from Sony, known for its exceptional light-gathering abilities and sharp image reproduction. Complementing this is a 50MP ultrawide sensor, which offers a remarkable 120-degree field of view, allowing users to capture expansive landscapes and group photos without compromising on detail. Finally, the setup includes a 50MP telephoto lens that provides 3x optical zoom, enabling users to get closer to their subjects without losing image fidelity.\n\nThese enhancements not only contribute to a broader field of view but are also geared toward improving image quality in various lighting conditions, especially low-light scenarios, thanks to advanced sensor technologies and algorithms that enhance dynamic range and reduce noise.\n\nActual testing will be crucial in determining just how much better the camera experience is on the OnePlus 13 compared to its predecessor, which already had an impressive camera setup.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: software and updates\n\nThe OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 12 both operate on OxygenOS, OnePlus\u2019 custom Android interface. However, their software and update policies differ significantly.\n\nThe OnePlus 13 comes with OxygenOS 15, based on Android 15, meaning you will have access to the latest Android features and security updates right from the start. In contrast, the OnePlus 12 requires an upgrade to obtain the same features.\n\nA major distinction lies in software support. OnePlus guarantees four major Android updates and five years of security updates for the OnePlus 13. In comparison, the OnePlus 12 is supported with three major Android updates and four years of security updates.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: price and availability\n\nThe OnePlus 13 will launch first in China, with a worldwide release likely to begin at the beginning of the year. The phone is expected to start at $799 in the U.S., which is similar to the OnePlus 12\u2019s launch price. However, this hasn\u2019t been confirmed. The phone comes in White-Dawn, Blue Moments, and Obsidian Black.\n\nThis year\u2019s phone has 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage and 12GB, 16GB, or 24GB of RAM, respectively. The OnePlus 12 has 256GB or 512GB of storage and 12GB or 16GB of RAM. It is available in Silky Black and the now iconic Flowy Emerald.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: Is it worth the upgrade?\n\nThe OnePlus 12 is an outstanding smartphone that current owners can enjoy for many years due to its powerful performance and robust features. With its sleek design, high-resolution display, and impressive camera capabilities, the OnePlus 12 meets the needs of a wide range of users, from casual consumers to tech enthusiasts.\n\nWhether to upgrade to the OnePlus 13 depends largely on your preferences and priorities. If you value having the latest chipset \u2014 such as a more advanced Snapdragon processor \u2014 along with ever-improving battery life and cutting-edge camera systems, then the OnePlus 13 is a compelling upgrade. The new model promises enhancements in processing power and efficiency and offers features like upgraded night mode photography and advanced computational photography, which could significantly enhance your photography experience. Additionally, it features a fresh design that brings a modern aesthetic to the table.\n\nHowever, if you typically do not upgrade your phone yearly, waiting this time might be perfectly reasonable. While you may not have the best-performing OnePlus available on the market, and the camera system will not be as advanced as the new model, the differences between the OnePlus 12 and 13 are mostly incremental. The OnePlus 12 still excels in everyday tasks, gaming, and multitasking, and its functionality remains top-notch. Therefore, while the upgrades are excellent and can enhance user experience, they are optional for everyone. If your OnePlus 12 meets your needs and performs well, holding off on an upgrade might be your best option."
