        "article_content": "Over the last two years, Congressional hearings on UFOs have introduced new terms to the popular vernacular. From hearings on Navy pilots who spotted a \u201cTic-Tac\u201d UFO in 2004, we got the term \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d (UAP). Then reports of strange objects hovering above the ocean gave us \u201cUnidentified Submerged Objects\u201d (USOs).\n\nNow, believers and skeptics alike can add another new bit of vocabulary to the debate around these bizarre happenings, which may tie them all together: \u201cImmaculate Constellation.\u201d\n\nDuring last week\u2019s UAP hearings on Capitol Hill, multiple witnesses described the elaborately named program as an alleged information-gathering and evidence-retrieval program conducted by the Pentagon without Congressional oversight. The Immaculate Constellation program, they say, has been withholding a treasure trove of high-resolution images and other data about UAP sightings from the public for decades.\n\nThe November 13 hearings followed up on the June 2023 Congressional event in which retired Navy Comm. David Fravor and fellow pilot Lt. Comm. Alex Dietrich described how their F/A-18 Hornets spotted and chased a white \u201cTic-Tac\u201d-shaped UAP for several minutes. According to analysis of radar tracks and grainy infrared video shot by the F/A-18s, the object displayed speeds of more than 45,000 miles per hour and pulled more than 2,000 Gs.\n\nJump ahead to 2024, and a new crop of believers have come forward about the function of Immaculate Constellation\u2014gathering reports of major UAP sightings and possible encounters; investigating possible crash or landing sites; and gathering physical UAP evidence, biological material, or technology.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. military and intelligence community are sitting on a huge amount of visual and other information\u2014still photos, video photos, other sensor information\u2014and they have for a very long time,\u201d said journalist Michael Shellenberger, one of the witnesses at the November 13 hearing. Meanwhile, the public has only ever seen fuzzy photos of some of those incidents.\n\nShellenberger delivered an 11-page report to Congress during the hearing, detailing claims about Immaculate Constellation; he says a current or former official and UAP whistleblower authored the report.\n\nThe November testimony lineup also included one-time Air Force Intelligence officer David Grusch\u2014who claimed during a prior hearing last summer that crashed UAPs had not only been recovered and studied for reverse-engineering, but that \u201cnon-human biologics\u201d had also been discovered inside\u2014and Lue Elizondo, who formerly headed the Pentagon\u2019s secretive UFO unit.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: UAP are real,\u201d Elizondo said in his opening testimony. \u201cAdvanced technologies not made by our government\u2014or any other government\u2014are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe. Furthermore, the U.S. is in possession of UAP technologies, as are some of our adversaries.\u201d Elizondo says it all adds up to a \u201cmultidecade, secretive arms race.\u201d\n\nHowever, skeptics point to the fact that none of the assembled witnesses presented anything by way of physical evidence or direct testimony from the witnesses or whistleblowers referenced. Department of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough stated the Pentagon denies the existence of such a program, while representatives of the U.S. Government agency AARO (All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office) continue to claim there is no evidence that UAPs are alien in nature.\n\nAvi Loeb, Ph.D.\u2014a physicist and professor at Harvard University who heads the Galileo Project, which seeks out alien intelligence or artifacts\u2014acknowledges the possibility of Immaculate Constellation, but highlighted the lack of any real proof. \u201cAll we have seen is written text,\u201d Loeb says. \u201cNo credible scientific evidence was made public.\u201d\n\nLoeb says his firm belief is that all major nations have programs to \u201cimage or retrieve relics from crash sites.\u201d However, he insists the purpose of such programs is to learn about technologies developed by adversarial nations and manage reverse-engineering efforts to reproduce such technologies.\n\n\u201cThere might also be biologics in such crash sites if the equipment carried pilots,\u201d he added. \u201cThe fundamental question is whether some of the data collected by these programs indicates an extraterrestrial technological origin. If such data exists, I would love to see it and help the Department of Defense or the Intelligence agencies figure out what it means.\u201d\n\nLoeb generally questions the usefulness of the ongoing series of congressional hearings, stressing that it is unlikely any meaningful admissions will come from the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cThe Galileo Project Observatory at Harvard University released its first commissioning data on half a million objects that it monitored in the sky over five months,\u201d Loeb says. \u201cWe also retrieved materials from the crash site of the first interstellar meteor in the Pacific Ocean.\u201d\n\nLoeb promises his team will openly share with the public any data they collect and any discoveries they make.\n\n\u201cThis standard scientific practice is far more informative than political maneuvers aimed to disclose classified information from stubborn government agencies,\u201d he says. \u201cA robust answer to Enrico Fermi\u2019s old question of \u2018where is everybody?\u2019 will originate from scientists\u2014not from politicians or journalists.\u201d"

CoAgent\u2019s Agentic Generative UI creates dynamic, AI-generated interfaces that adapt to user needs and agent outputs, providing visibility into the agent\u2019s state and building trust.\n\nIf you like the features stated earlier, you might want to consider using CoAgents for your business, let us see how to do that.\n\nBuild AI CoAgents or apps powered by Copilot\n\nFollow the steps below to build AI CoAgents or apps powered by Copilot.\n\nInstall CopilotKit Configure Remote Backend Endpoint Add LangGraph agent\n\nLet us talk about them in detail.\n\n1] Install CopilotKit\n\nBefore we begin with CoAgents, we need to first install CopilotKit on your device. We are presumming that you have already installed Node.js and npm on your computer and have created a folder for React applications, however, the last part is optional for this step. CopilotKit uses an open source LLM model, in this tutorial we will be using OpenAI API key. Without further ado, let\u2019s get started.\n\nOpen Windows Terminal and go to the location where you have created the React app using cd (change directory) command.\n\ncd C:\\React\\myapplication\n\nNow, run the following command.\n\nnpm install @copilotkit/react-core @copilotkit/react-ui @copilotkit/runtime\n\nThen, execute the command mentioned below to install OpenAI.\n\nnpm install openai\n\nIn your project, go to the .eve file, it will be located in the root, and add the following line.\n\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n\nAfter making changes to the file, we recommend you navigate to docs.copilot.ai/quickstart to know how to configure the End Point and configure CopilotKit provider in your project.\n\n2] Configure Remote Backend Endpoint\n\nIn order to integrate Python-based services (or any other Node.js alternative), we have to connect Copilot app to a Remote Backend endpoint. To do that, let us first install Copilot dependencies in Windows Terminal using the following query.\n\npip install copilotkit fastapi uvicorn --extra-index-url https://copilotkit.gateway.scarf.sh/simple/\n\nNow, we need to setup FastAI server, to do that, run the commands mentioned below.\n\nmkdir my_copilotkit_remote_endpoint\n\ncd my_copilotkit_remote_endpoint\n\necho. > server.py\n\nIf the echo didn\u2019t work, you can open the folder in Visual Studio Code, and then create server.py file.\n\nOpen the server.py file in VSCode and then paste the following lines of code.\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n\nNow, go back to Windows Terminal and install FastAPI and Uvicorn.\n\npip install fastapi uvicorn\n\nOnce you are done with that, go to docs.copilot.ai guides to learn more.\n\n3] Add LangGraph agent\n\nNext up, we need to integrate LangGraph agent to the server.py file. First, locate the CopilotKitSDK instance within your Python Remote Endpoint, usually found in server.py. Next, adjust the CopilotKitSDK instance (established in the preceding step) to accommodate LangGraph agents. You need to add the following lines of code.\n\nagents=[ LangGraphAgent( name=\"basic_agent\", description=\"Agent that answers questions about the weather\", graph=the_langraph_graph, # copilotkit_config={ # if you use Google Gemini, uncomment this code (and import `copilotkit_messages_to_langchain`, see above) # \"convert_messages\": copilotkit_messages_to_langchain(use_function_call=True) # } ) ],\n\nThis should be enclosed under CopilotKitSDK tag.\n\nTo know more, we recommend you follow the guide mentioned in docs.copilotkit.ai/coagents.\n\nRead: What are best free AI Extensions for Visual Studio Code?\n\nHow do I build my own Copilot?\n\nTo create a new copilot, go to the Copilot Studio home page (at /copilotstudio.microsoft.com) and select Create in the left navigation, then choose the Copilots page. Alternatively, you can select + New copilot on the Copilots page. Use the chat to describe your copilot, guided by the provided questions, or select Skip to configure and fill out the form. Finally, select \u201cCreate\u201d to complete the process.\n\nRead: Best AI tools for Developers\n\nCan Copilot generate code?\n\nYes, Copilot can generate code. However, it can not be perfect; there can be multiple glitches and bugs. Therefore, one should not integrate the code provided by any AI chatbot without thorough manual inspections. You can use Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in Edge, the built-in app or use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio using extension.\n\nAlso Read: Use Copilot to Refractor Code."

The new version will be released shortly.The Haathi Alert AI App now includes GIS layers of railways and power infrastructure. The forest department is collecting contact information of station masters and electricity department staff working in forest divisions to incorporate into the mapping system.Staff members will receive notifications when elephant herds enter specific zones, particularly within two to three kilometres of electrical lines and railway tracks.Electricity personnel will verify proper wire heights, whilst station masters will alert train drivers about elephants in corridors. Train operators will then reduce speed to ensure elephant safety.The power line GPS mapping will be integrated into the app's GIS layer. AI-powered alerts via calls, SMS, and WhatsApp will notify electricity and forest departments when elephants approach power lines.This system will help identify hazards in elephant corridors, including low-hanging wires, unstable poles, and illegal fencing. Officials can monitor elephant locations and power infrastructure through the app.Railway track GIS data from Google Maps will be incorporated into the system. Alerts will notify relevant staff when elephants are detected within one kilometre of tracks. Staff must register with the Alert App for this functionality.\u201cThe infrastructure mapping is complete, and the app will include manual power line entry options. The system upgrades should be finished within one month,\u201d said a senior forest officer.The Chhattisgarh Forest Department has implemented comprehensive measures to reduce human-elephant conflict, promoting peaceful coexistence through technology, community involvement, and administrative measures in elephant migration areas.Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and Head of Forest Forces V Sreenivasa Rao said, \"Forest department is dedicated to minimizing casualties of both elephants and humans, besides protecting livelihoods, and ensuring harmonious coexistence between humans and elephants.\"The Katghora forest division houses 40-60 permanent elephant residents in various ranges, whilst 90-110 elephants move through the Dharamjaigarh division. Elephants have established a permanent presence in several ranges of the Surajpur forest division.Among the many initiatives the department takes to prevent casualties caused due to human-elephant conflict is adopting technological solutions, including ODK (open data kit) Collect and Elephant Tracker apps for real-time monitoring.Control rooms equipped with thermal drones and night vision devices ensure continuous surveillance, regular power line inspections prevent electrocution risks, and warning signs and awareness materials are installed in affected areas.Community engagement initiatives include awareness programmes through Gaj Yatra and daily patrols by Hathi Mitr Dal. Forest staff provide protection during festivals and critical events, ensuring public safety in elephant-prone areas.Special protection measures are implemented during elections and other events. Forest personnel assist in safely escorting residents through elephant-prone areas. Farmers receive guidance about harvesting schedules to minimise crop damage.Through these comprehensive measures, the department continues to foster sustainable coexistence between humans and elephants in shared territories. Apps like ODK Collect (works without internet) and Elephant Tracker enable real-time updates on elephant movements, with nearby villagers notified via calls and messages. The Sajak Alarm System ensures timely alerts when sightings are reported through the app.Katghora DFO Kumar Nishant highlighted, \"In the past six months, elephants have been regularly monitored at 133 locations through this app. The department maintains special vigilance at these sites to minimize damage.\"In Pratapur, the efforts ensured that Chhath Vrati mothers safely returned home after the rituals. In Dharamjaigarh, a district-level wildlife protection committee, guided by the District Collector, formulates safety strategies.Compensation mechanisms have been streamlined to address crop and property damage efficiently. Surajpur DFO Pankaj Kamal noted, \u201cIn 2024, compensation cases amounting to Rs 72 lakh for crop damage have been successfully prepared and paid so far.\u201dSimilarly, Dharamjaigarh DFO Abhishek Jogawat stated, \u201cOver the past two years, a total compensation amount of Rs 2,16,58,445 has been disbursed in the Dharamjaigarh Forest Division to address cases of human loss, injuries, crop damage, and property damage.\u201dJogawat shared, \u201cIn the past two years, the Forest Department has safely escorted 78 people in the Dharamjaigarh forest range, 21 people in the Chhal forest range, and 2 people in the Kapu forest range to their homes.\u201dFarmers are also advised to expedite paddy harvesting in areas with potential elephant activity to minimize damage.Meanwhile, a larger herd of 90-110 elephants actively traverses the Chaal and Dharamjaigarh forest ranges in the Dharamjagarh division.In the Surajpur forest division, elephants have established a permanent presence in the Pratapur, Ghui, Ramanujnagar, and Biharpur forest ranges."

Some are highly independent, tackling complex tasks with minimal input, while others might still rely on a bit of human guidance. This spectrum of autonomy is not just a technical detail\u2014it\u2019s a glimpse into the future of AI, where machines learn and adapt, becoming more efficient over time. The Google team provide more insight deeper into the world of AI agents, explaining how these digital assistants are not only transforming industries but also opening up new possibilities for innovation and collaboration.\n\nAI Agents in Everyday Life\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : AI agents operate autonomously, making decisions and executing tasks without human intervention, similar to AI microservices.\n\nThe autonomy of AI agents, known as agentic behavior, varies based on system capabilities and task complexity.\n\nAI agents are applied in diverse industries, managing tasks like email prioritization, travel planning, and fashion recommendations.\n\nDeveloping AI agents can involve simple algorithms or custom models, with various frameworks available to suit different functionalities.\n\nAI agents can collaborate to enhance outcomes, with each agent performing specific functions to improve efficiency and productivity.\n\nDecoding Agentic Behavior in AI\n\nThe concept of agentic behavior is central to understanding AI agents. This behavior refers to the varying degrees of autonomy exhibited by these systems. Some AI agents demonstrate high levels of independence, capable of completing complex tasks with minimal external input. Others may require a degree of human guidance, especially for more nuanced or critical decisions. The spectrum of autonomy is directly related to the agent\u2019s underlying capabilities and the intricacy of its designated tasks.\n\nKey aspects of agentic behavior include:\n\nDecision-making capabilities\n\nTask execution without constant supervision\n\nAdaptability to changing environments\n\nLearning from interactions and outcomes\n\nThe level of autonomy in AI agents is not static; it can evolve as the system learns and improves over time, potentially increasing its independence and efficiency.\n\nDiverse Applications Across Industries\n\nThe versatility of AI agents has led to their adoption across a wide range of sectors, demonstrating their potential to transform various aspects of business and daily life. In the corporate world, AI agents are streamlining operations by managing emails, prioritizing tasks, and even assisting in decision-making processes. In agriculture, they\u2019re optimizing resource use by automating irrigation systems based on real-time weather data analysis.\n\nThe capabilities of AI agents extend to solving complex puzzles, as evidenced by systems that can tackle a Rubik\u2019s cube with robotic assistance.

More info\n\nStepping out of my car, I was immediately greeted by the loud roar of the M5. I was surrounded by trees and fields, but make no mistake, this was not the countryside.\n\nI'd travelled to Sandwell Valley Country Park, a hidden slice of greenery situated in the heart of the Black Country. For a 1.5 mile stretch, the M5 passes through this green corridor, leaving behind the masses of towering buildings, factories and housing estates that make up the West Midlands conurbation.\n\nNear this small section of motorway, hidden from view by the line of trees, are the remains of a Christian monastery built 900 years ago. But you won't be able to see Sandwell Priory from your car window; it's located a five-minute walk into Priory Woods in West Bromwich.\n\nREAD MORE: New 455-mile train service will link Wales, England and Scotland direct - and it stops in Birmingham\n\nGet breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp , click the link to join\n\nIf you do manage to find it, all that remains of the monastery, which was founded in 1190AD by a man named William Fitz Guy, are several feet of stonework. The bricks appear in rectangular shapes on the ground, the foundations of where the ancient buildings once stood.\n\nBut while only a relic of the Sandwell Priory monastery remains today, there's been rumours that the monks who once resided there still haunt the land. Drivers claim to have witnessed such figures as far as the M5 - even being forced to swerve around them on the carriageway.\n\nWith such strange reports occurring in the area, I decided to set out and explore further. From where I'd parked up at Sandwell Valley, the ruins were only a 10-minute walk away via a small, green footbridge over the M5.\n\nThe only unusual thing I'd spotted so far was a woman walking three-legged across the car park. There were also a number of peculiar 'MJ' graffiti tags. But alas, the area seemed quiet and untroubled. Turning left from my car, I embarked on a narrow footpath into a set of woods, with the footbridge just up ahead.\n\nOn the other side, a shower of golden leaves were floating to the ground from the towering trees. It was a picturesque autumn scene. Save for a man who came speeding past on an electric bike, there was no one about.\n\nThen a little robin came to say hello, flitting through the trees as I walked along the path next to a pristine-looking golf course. Further down the path, a man was perched on a mobility scooter with a long camera lens fixed up on the tree canopies above.\n\nFinally, just beyond him emerged the old ruins. There wasn't much to them. A number of information boards stood overlooking the medieval site, informing passers-by of its history. But there was a touching little memorial placed in the corner of the brickwork in memory of someone's mother.\n\nIt was hard to fathom how old the priory ruins actually were, standing amongst the stones. This dates back to the medieval period, not long after the Norman conquest of England.\n\nHaving taken in all that I could, I started heading back to my car. As I passed the man with the camera again, I asked: \"Have you ever seen anything spooky around here?\"\n\n\"No,\" he laughed. \"I don't believe in anything like that. But I hope I don't see anything out here,\" he added in a more stern tone. Just like Cannock Chase, this was another wooded area seeped in mystery. And I could see why it attracted wonder and intrigue.\n\nPast research by the paranormal group West Midlands Ghost Club had gathered together accounts of sightings believed to have been connected to the priory ruins. One motorist reported seeing a 'monk-like' figure walking along an unnamed road in the area before the entity simply 'vanished'.\n\n\"The person concerned was not alone but they happened to have been in the car with three other family members, with everyone sharing in the encounter,\" a spokesperson for the ghost club said. On other occasions, motorists had even reported their experiences to the police, such was their level of concern.\n\nThe paranormal group's spokesperson added: \"It seems, and usually entails people - using the section of motorway nearest to the priory ruins - either seeing monk-like figures in the cutting or sometimes having to swerve to avoid such phantoms. It is frequently claimed that the people concerned are not locals - and do not know of any spooky reputation to the area - and that a number of these experiences are reported to the police.\""

        "article_content": "When I mention that I\u2019ve written books of visionary fiction, the response I usually get is along the lines of \u201cWhat exactly is it that?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t give the same answer to everyone. For example, I might say, \u201cIt\u2019s fiction that includes a metaphysical element.\u201d\n\nOr \u201cIt\u2019s a type of speculative fiction that is hopeful or transcendent.\u201d\n\nOr \u201cIt uses a fictional story to communicate a philosophical message.\u201d\n\nOr even, \u201cIt\u2019s fiction that can expand your consciousness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n(Genres as Crushers of Creativity.)\n\nThe fact that I find myself juggling these definitions based on the person I\u2019m speaking with should tell you a lot about the current state of visionary fiction. Moreover, it\u2019s easy to conflate visionary fiction with a range of similar genres\u2014metaphysical fiction, New Age fiction, mystical fiction, fantasy, and science fiction, to name a few.\n\nNone of this is surprising when you consider how relatively obscure visionary fiction is within the world of publishing of 2024. Since I have been writing it\u2014and now that I\u2019ve won several awards in the designated category of visionary fiction\u2014I\u2019d like to help clarify some things and offer a few suggestions for anyone interested in writing visionary fiction, or just anyone paying attention to the evolution of genres.\n\nFor our purposes here\u2014even if there is little agreement about this in the publishing world\u2014I will define visionary fiction as books in which the understanding and expansion of human consciousness drives the story, making it more than an escapist read.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMy own interest in visionary fiction goes back to my 20s, when I had what could be described as a spontaneous spiritual awakening. Without any precipitating substance. One day I was looking at reality in the concrete manner I always had, and the way it seemed everybody around me did, and the next I was experiencing a reality in which everything was made of light. Nothing was not light. I had no background to understand this, so I turned to my local bookstore, looking for books that addressed metaphysical questions (that is, questions about the nature of reality).\n\nThis was the 1970s, and pickings were slim. The first book I found helpful was Bucke\u2019s Cosmic Consciousness, originally published in 1901. Books by spiritual teachers from different traditions followed\u2014all nonfiction.\n\nThere was a smattering of fiction as well, even if it wasn\u2019t formally tagged as metaphysical\u2014for example, Hesse\u2019s Bead Game, Bach\u2019s Jonathan Livingston Seagull, and Castaneda\u2019s The Teachings of Don Juan. These authors wrote to help fellow humans understand the most profound metaphysical questions, and did so largely outside the established channels of religion. Their books, which are still considered classics, were lifesavers for me.\n\nOver the following decades, metaphysical bookstores expanded their presence, and more mainstream bookstores added metaphysical sections. And of course, publishers put out more metaphysical books. Self-publishing was taking off, and some self-published metaphysical books were so successful that they were picked up by major publishers.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAlso during that period, nonfiction far outstripped fiction in metaphysical bookstores. The East West Bookstore, which I frequented in the 1990s, had one shelf of fiction and an entire building filled with nonfiction. Why was this? My theory is that authors viewed nonfiction as more convincing, and feared their ideas would be dismissed if presented as fiction.\n\nNote that I\u2019m using the term metaphysical. That\u2019s because I hadn\u2019t heard the term visionary.\n\nWhile researching for this article, the first mention I found of visionary fiction was in The American Theosophist, where an author claimed in 1982 that Renee Weber, a professor of philosophy at Rutgers University, had recently coined the term. It was many years, however, before it moved from academia to the publishing industry.\n\nIn the 1990s, I ran a small publishing company focused on metaphysical books. Our distributor was Hampton Roads. HR put itself on the map in a big way with Conversations With God. Having an overnight bestseller meant they couldn\u2019t print enough copies to meet demand and were forced to sell Conversations to a larger publisher. The proceeds allowed them to set up new imprints, and Frank DeMarco, one of the founders, told me he wanted to start a visionary fiction imprint to show that such books can be fiction. Even if he didn\u2019t coin the term\u2014though, as I recall, he thought he did\u2014he gave it a seat in the publishing industry.\n\nCheck out Jude Berman's The Vow here:\n\nBookshop | Amazon\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n(WD uses affiliate links)\n\nMuch as we saw visionary fiction as the wave of the future and expected it to flourish, that didn\u2019t happen. After a flurry of activity in the 1990s, it faded with the turning of the century. Why did that happen? I haven\u2019t seen a convincing explanation, but I think it was due to the convergence of a variety of factors, such as the greater popularity of fantasy and science fiction and the waning of the New Age movement. Arguably, when you consider how much the publishing world at large has expanded, visionary fiction is more obscure now than when Frank tried to get it off the ground.\n\nNor did the rise of genres, including the proliferation of genres similar to visionary fiction, help. When I search for visionary fiction on Goodreads, I get primarily books I would call science fiction, including techno-thrillers about robots, space travel, cyberpunk. In fairness, their authors are not necessarily calling them visionary fiction; rather, Goodreads is pulling them up due to the dearth of actual visionary fiction.\n\nSo what do I suggest?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWe should put in a greater effort to establish genre definitions. While I recognize there is no single formal mechanism for that, I can do my own small part by settling on one definition for visionary fiction when I respond to questions of \u201cWhat exactly is it that?\u201d I would limit metaphysical books to nonfiction. There is an enormous body of nonfiction centered on spirituality, philosophy, and the metaphysical questions of human existence, and fiction gets lost when combined with it. Other fiction genres are not subsumed by a related nonfiction genre, so why should metaphysical fiction? It deserves its own category. I propose visionary fiction be recognized as the official counterpart to metaphysical nonfiction. The virtual nonexistence of a visionary nonfiction genre reinforces the appropriateness of visionary for fiction. I would also establish standards for visionary fiction. On the one hand, visionary fiction can incorporate elements as diverse as sci-fi, magical realism, fantasy, or literary fiction. On the other hand, if its metaphysical element is not central, a book shouldn\u2019t qualify as visionary fiction. A story about angels, for example, isn\u2019t visionary fiction merely because it has angels; a paranormal romance isn\u2019t visionary fiction unless the characters grapple with metaphysical questions. I\u2019d retire the New Age fiction category. It\u2019s outdated. Worse, many books categorized as New Age are perpetrators of cultural appropriation, taking Indigenous wisdom and watering it down for a popular audience. We should know better.\n\nUltimately, I believe the world can benefit from visionary fiction with good storytelling that inspires readers to think about deeper questions. We have no shortage of books to help us escape; why not use some of our moments of escape to form a vision of life that better meets the challenges of this century?"

        "article_content": "Read time: 3 minutes\n\nWith a background in surgical oncology, cancer research has always been my passion, even during my medical studies. Eventually, this dedication led to my transition into full-time research and a move to the United States to join the Lombardi Cancer Center. It was here that a recognition of the critical importance of tissue standardization in advancing cancer research became evident.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot of attention has been given to culturing conditions and experimental protocols, yet the tissue itself \u2013 the very foundation of cancer research \u2013 is often taken for granted. People assume that once excised, the sampled tissue is stable, but that is not the case. Just as the brain sustains damage within minutes of oxygen deprivation, excised tissue begins to change at the molecular level due to ischemia (lack of blood flow) \u2013 this realization was key to developing a standardized procedure for tissue handling.\n\nBridging the gap in tissue handling\n\nTo truly understand cancer, tissue samples need to be processed as quickly and as carefully as possible, preserving their biological integrity. Developing standardized processes for tissue collection thus became the cornerstone of Indivumed, the biotech company based in Hamburg.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen observing a typical hospital infrastructure, one sees that surgeons are focused on the patient and removing the tumor, while pathologists are focused on analyzing the tissue afterward \u2013 which makes total sense. However, the time between these events is a gray area where no one takes responsibility for the tissue. If the tissue is not handled properly, it can degrade, compromising the integrity of the sample. This is a critical issue because insights into new potential therapeutic targets can be lost when tissue is compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering the millions of dollars that are spent on drug discovery, it is unacceptable for poor tissue quality to introduce avoidable risks. Indivumed helped solve this by placing trained personnel in partner clinics worldwide, ensuring that tissues are processed quickly and properly in a standardized way. It seems like a simple, sensible solution \u2013 but it works.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are, of course, a few challenges to getting hospitals on board with this process. Money is one aspect, but it is also about getting surgeons, pathologists and nurses to adopt this new process \u2013 even if they do not benefit from it directly. In the early days, we provided hospitals with access to our biobank free of charge, which helped. More recently, we have focused on providing access to data collected, which allows hospitals to conduct their own research using this valuable resource.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, we published a research article demonstrating that thousands of potential therapeutic targets are lost if tissue is not collected in a standardized way \u2013 backing over 20 years of work. While most of the oncology field logically understands this, it has never been conclusively proven \u2013 and if there is no proof; no one really takes notice. However, it is not just about preserving tissue, it is about ensuring the data generated from those samples are reliable. This approach benefits the entire research community, providing a stronger foundation for future discoveries.\n\nThe rise of multiomics in cancer research\n\nCancer is an incredibly complex disease \u2013 no single layer of data is enough to fully understand it. To gain a holistic view of tumor biology, we need to analyze DNA, RNA, proteins and phosphoproteins.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term \u201cmultiomics\u201d gets used in a lot of varied contexts nowadays. Many people claim to be doing multiomics, but they are often only looking at a limited dataset, for example, 10 proteins and some exome sequencing. What they are doing is not \u201comics,\u201d and it is not \u201cmulti.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Indivumed, we perform whole-genome sequencing \u2013 rather than whole-exome sequencing \u2013 paired with whole transcriptome, miRNA, proteomics and phosphoproteomics data. This comprehensive dataset, based on tumor and normal tissue with 10\u201312 minutes of cold ischemia time, allows us to identify new therapeutic targets that others might miss.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy integrating multiple layers of data, we can uncover targets that are not obvious from genomics alone. This data can be compared between tumor and normal tissue samples from the same patient thanks to our extensive biobank, allowing us to identify specific molecular changes that drive cancer. This multiomics, multimodal strategy opens a wealth of potential therapeutic targets, offering more precise avenues for drug development. For pharmaceutical companies, this reduces the risks of their drug discovery efforts and increases the likelihood of success in clinical trials.\n\nLooking towards the future of precision medicine in cancer treatment\n\nThe future aim is to discover novel therapies that are much more effective across a shorter period of time. With the data we have collected and the targets we are discovering, we plan to guide therapies more accurately to individual patients. This is something that will have a massive impact on future cancer treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\nWork in this area needs to remain flexible, adaptable and have an understanding of hospital culture. Collaboration is key, and it is important to be patient and modest in one\u2019s approach. We have achieved a lot already, and with persistence, we expect to achieve even more."
