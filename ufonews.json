        "article_content": "The Sunday Papers is our weekly roundup of great writing about (mostly) videogames from across the web.\n\nSundays are for eating Biscoff spread and rewatching Better Call Saul, again. Crunchy, ofc. Before that, let\u2019s read some writing that I, Nic Reuben, personally found interesting about games (and game related things!)\n\nBug Quest wrote some nice words about UFO 50.\n\nin fact, UFO 50\u2019s investment in its fiction really only highlights and celebrates the actual human beings who worked on all of its many games. i have no idea how many (if any) of the notes associated with UFO Soft\u2019s games are autobiographical. i know for a fact, though, that UFO 50\u2019s actual developers - Derek Yu, Jon Perry, Ojiro Fumoto, Eirik Suhrke, Paul Hubans, and Tyriq Plummer - are, like their fictional counterparts, people with friends and families and dreams and favorite bars and paintings in their offices. humanity is something that we take for granted every time we play a video game, but UFO 50 celebrates it as the thing that makes games so special.\n\nOh hey, more UFO 50. It\u2019s 50 games, it can have two entries. Christian Donlan chatted to Derek Yu for Eurogamer.\n\n\"Each game needed to have its own unique identity but it also needed to be part of the collection,\" Yu explains. \"I would say that most games started as their own thing, though, and then became more and more considerate of their role in the collection as time went on. And through that process, each game's identity actually became stronger because of its connection to the whole. It didn't just exist in a vacuum anymore - a game could be a sequel or share themes with other games or maybe be something one-of-a-kind. There's a lot more context for each game as part of UFO 50 than as a standalone title.\"\n\nEd Smith wrote about Soma for Bullet Points Monthly\n\nThe problem however is that videogames are often so systematic and so mechanical that they are only able to illustrate perfect visions of ideologies. Think about SimCity, or more recently Cities Skylines 2, wherein certain esotericisms of the games\u2019 respective code bases resulted in a large number of homeless people appearing within players\u2019 cities. In both cases, these swells in the homeless population were regarded by the game makers and by players as imperfections within the system, as bugs, as glitches, and they were summarily \u2018fixed.\u2019 Both of these games simulate and symbolise ideologies related to capital, democracy, enterprise, social welfare, policy, and so on, but if the results of those simulations drift outside utopia\u2014when the ideologies in the game result in a lessening of the player\u2019s success\u2014the simulations, the symbols, are considered defective.\n\nthey had a famous mobile game called White Cat Project, not copying Mario, not copying Pok\u00e9mon, not copying Zelda, nothing at all. Nintendo brought forward six patents that they thought that this company was violating inside their very successful mobile game at one time. It was one of the most popular mobile games in Japan, and they built a huge case. One of the patents was for a confirmation screen after sleep mode. You know when devices are sleeping and you want to resume there's a confirmation screen in a lot of games? \u201cAre you sure you want to resume?\u201d And then you tap yes or no. Nintendo has a patent on that, and this game uses it. And then Nintendo said, you know, look, you're using our patent and you cannot do that. You're not paying us any licensing fees.\n\nFor 404 Media, Emanuel Maiberg chatted to Japan game industry analyst Serkan Toto about the Nintendo lawsuit against Palword. (Edit: this wasn't paywalled for me when I included it, but appears to be now. Apologies for the annoyance!)\n\nHere\u2019s a cool mech piece from the RPS archives that came up in Slack this week. Here\u2019s a cool piece on graphics card box art from the archives of that other PC gaming site. Here\u2019s Resident Evil 1\u2019s original cast playing the game. Here\u2019s a brief argument that FromSoftware\u2019s influence is hurting the action genre, which I foresee some of you might enjoy scrapping about on this, the holy Sabbath. RPS contributor and good wordsman Rick Lane has a newsletter recommending Steam demos. I am not immune to Moo Deng propaganda. Music this week is a new mix from Pizza Hotline. Have a great weekend!"

The franchise is popular and widely celebrated for its animation style. With the film dethroning Studio Ghibli in its position as the highest-grossing Asian movie, the franchise marked its success. Furthermore, it is one of the most-watched anime. And there\u2019s more to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMitsuri Kanroji in a still from the series | Credit: Ufotable\n\nWhile the franchise has bagged several accolades and achievements, its success was unanticipated. This holds especially true with the anime as Ufotable producer Yuma Takahashi revealed in an interview. To say the least, his reasons are valid considering the crew\u2019s painstaking efforts in animating the authors\u2019 work.\n\nUfotable producer reveals the reason behind the unplanned success of Demon Slayer.\n\nUfotable is known for producing some of the notable anime such as Garden of Sinners, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, and Fate/Zero. Although the studio is known for adapting games into animations, it received its breakthrough with Demon Slayer\u2019s success. Apart from working on the anime series, the animators played a pivotal role in ensuring the franchise\u2019s success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaki and Gyutaro in a still from the series | Credit: Ufotable\n\nBesides that, the series bagged the Best Animation Award and Best Art Direction Award held at the 2024 Crunchyroll Awards. It comes as no surprise considering the painstaking efforts and time invested by the animators in producing an immaculate masterpiece. While the series made a breakthrough with its superior animation, it was unplanned as revealed by the producer.\n\nRelated Muichiro Tokito was Singlehandedly Responsible for Making One of the Best Support Characters Quit the Demon Slayer Corps\n\nIn an interview with Anime News Network, producer Yuma Takahashi revealed the unplanned nature of the series and the crew\u2019s motive behind the series\u2019 success. He quoted:\n\nThey always find a way to go higher and higher\u2026and higher and higher and higher. In terms of ufotable\u2019s goals for this series specifically, it\u2019s not their aim necessarily to make the best anime ever, but to make the best Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. So what you\u2019re seeing now is their best version of that source material.\n\nApart from its character design, the series is highly praised for its compelling storyline and animation that is par excellence. Moreover, its depiction of female characters and masculinity stands in contrast with other anime. The animators did absolute justice to the mangaka\u2019s work nonetheless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Animators went above and beyond to do absolute justice to Koyoharu Gotouge\u2019s work.\n\nThrough their attention to detail and hand-done animations, the studio did absolute justice to the author\u2019s work. This holds especially true with the blend of CG and traditionally drawn animation. Moreover, the effort and careful detailing of the scenes are exceptional and even Hayao Miyazaki acknowledged it.\n\nGyomei Himejima in a still from the series | Credit: Ufotable\n\nHowever, the studio\u2019s efforts to maintain the authenticity of the series go beyond animation. Takahashi revealed the research went behind in recreating the historical period in the series. He quoted:\n\nWe relied on a trip to the mountains to help illustrate the snowy scenery of episode 1. We found a place where there was tons of snow to inspire us in creating Tanjiro\u2019s homeland, although it was extremely freezing cold, and at one point there was some risk of us getting lost up there.\n\nIn addition to that, the creators involved the author in the process. In their move to stay true to the core text, they also respected the author\u2019s decision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, the series continues to be celebrated and loved. From its well-written characters to its portrayal of masculinity, the series sets itself apart from most of its shonen contemporaries. To say the least, the studio and the author played an equal yet pivotal role in the series\u2019 success.\n\nDemon Slayer is available for streaming on Crunchyroll. The manga is available for reading on Viz Media."

        "article_content": "In sci-fi shows like Westworld and The Expanse, characters use evolved mobile devices with sleek transparent designs that can project holograms or magically morph their interface as needed.\n\nFanciful? Maybe. But smartphones are about to take a leap forward.\n\nToday, tech giants are putting the pieces in place for advancements in artificial intelligence that will push the smartphone into its next era \u2014 and soon. Within the next few years, experts say, our phones will be much more intuitive, helpful and even friendly. That shift would not only make phones feel fresh and interesting in ways they haven't been for years but could also liberate us from being immersed in our screens.\n\nJust last week, Apple announced the iPhone 16 and iPhone16 Pro, which it's trumpeting as the first iPhones built for the company's new AI system, Apple Intelligence. The new phones include a dedicated button for triggering the camera and \"visual intelligence,\" an AI-fueled camera mode that lets you learn about your environment just by pointing your phone and pushing a button.\n\nIn the future that companies like Apple, OpenAI, Samsung and Google are sketching out, your phone's camera won't just be for snapping selfies or documenting your vacation \u2014 it'll be a wider window into the world around you. Apple's upcoming visual intelligence feature is just one example.\n\nAnd that's only the starting point. Amy Webb, a quantitative futurist and founder and CEO of the Future Today Institute, says she's seeing an \"extraordinary number\" of new devices, patents and funding rounds involving new tech devices without screens, adding that the phone as we know it may eventually \"fade into the background.\" She likens it to the evolutionary burst millions of years ago that introduced a stunningly broad range of animals.\n\n\"At the moment, we are at the beginning of a Cambrian explosion of devices and sensors,\" she says.\n\nFor now, most smartphones will continue to look like the slabs of glass and metal we carry around today for the foreseeable future (sorry, no holograms or see-through screens yet). But they'll get better at surfacing information the moment we need it, almost like the adaptable software shown on the devices in The Expanse. Instead of constantly jumping between apps and digging through menus, you may find yourself simply speaking to your phone to get things done. Or better yet, your phone's screen may show exactly what you need without you even having to ask.\n\n\"My very top-down view is that long term, I would like a phone where you would never have to go into the settings menu,\" Patrick Chomet, Samsung's executive vice president and head of customer experience, tells me. \"You shouldn't have to know the name of any feature. And we wouldn't have to name them, because the device would have full enough intelligence and context to support the actions that you want to do.\"\n\nSpeaking with tech executives, analysts and futurists, and drawing on my own experience trying new devices and cutting-edge virtual assistants, has painted a picture of where the smartphone is headed.\n\nAI arrives to breathe new life into the smartphone\n\nAt a time when the majority of people in the world own a smartphone, the idea of having a supercomputer in your pocket isn't as novel as it once was. It's harder than ever to get consumers excited about new phones \u2014 as innovative as folding phones are, they haven't exactly ignited much fervor among consumers. And there's data to show it. Forty-four percent of smartphone owners upgrade their phone only when it breaks or needs replacing, according to a CNET survey published in September based on data collected by YouGov.\n\nThe same survey also indicated that consumers hold onto their phones for three years or longer, aligning with comments Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg made to CNBC in July that subscribers keep their phones for way over 36 months. Although the smartphone market began to rebound this year, sales reached nearly a decade low in 2023, according to Counterpoint.\n\n\"The smartphone has become commoditized, so they're all fairly similar,\" says Webb. \"Even though you have two predominant operating systems that are different, they're also not totally different from each other.\"\n\nBut following the explosive launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, smartphone makers saw an opportunity for AI to chart a new path for our smartphones. The first wave of generative AI features has largely focused on very specific use cases, such as editing a photo, summarizing a transcript or translating a conversation. Niche as these tools may be, they bring something to the smartphone experience that's been sorely lacking in recent years: features that feel genuinely new, like the ability to create an image from scratch with just a few taps.\n\nYet this is just the beginning of what tech leaders see as being a more significant breakthrough in the smartphone's growth. The next stage of AI-fueled updates could lay the groundwork for a future in which we don't need to open as many apps, menus or services to get things done on our phones.\n\nAs phones get smarter and better at understanding our intentions, we'll find ourselves relying on screens less.\n\nIt's a transformation that Sameer Samat, Google's president of the Android ecosystem, and Sissie Hsiao, vice president and general manager of Gemini experiences, have been thinking about a lot \u2014 and that's important considering Android powers nearly 80% of the world's smartphones, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSamat tells me how Google is \"rebuilding\" Android, with AI being at the center of it all, and of course Gemini \u2014 the company's AI assistant \u2014 being the star.\n\n\"This is not your traditional assistant anymore,\" Hsiao says. \"This is really capable of doing new things.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nZooey Liao/CNET\n\nPhones have eyes (and voices)\n\nAdvancements in generative AI have made virtual assistants much smarter and more conversational than the Siris and Alexas of years past. Instead of just answering questions, voice-enabled helpers are getting better at sounding more natural and convincing.\n\nNick Turley, OpenAI's product lead for ChatGPT, thinks speaking to our devices will go from niche to mainstream the same way chatbots have over the past two years.\n\n\"A year from now, I would suspect that voice could be the primary way that people use [ChatGPT],\" he says.\n\nIt's not just words anymore, either; tech companies and phone makers want our devices to get better at \"seeing\" our surroundings too. That message was clear during Apple's annual device event on Sept. 9, where it introduced a new feature coming to the iPhone 16 called visual intelligence.\n\nWith the push of the iPhone 16's new Camera Control button, you'll be able to point the phone at a restaurant and find its hours or scan a flier for an event to add it to your calendar. There are also on-screen buttons for launching a Google search based on your photo or for asking ChatGPT about an image. Based on Apple's pre-recorded demo, it looks like a new type of visual interface for the iPhone that leans on the camera as the primary means of input, instead of opening an app and typing or swiping.\n\n\"I imagine that ChatGPT in five years is out there performing actions for you, on your behalf, rather than just responding.\" Nick Turley, OpenAI's product lead for ChatGPT\n\nApple is just the latest tech company to explore an idea like this. In May, OpenAI showed how the chatbot could recognize math equations and provide tips in real time, like a virtual math tutor, just by pointing your phone at the problem. Google's Gemini helper can analyze the contents of a YouTube video to answer questions about it.\n\nFor Google, Gemini's current capabilities are laying the groundwork for a more ambitious rethinking of the virtual assistant: Project Astra. The prototype digital assistant can \"see\" and \"understand\" your surroundings using your phone's camera and combine that data with speech input to process requests.\n\nIn a video shown at Google's developer conference in May, the user pointed a phone at a speaker sitting on someone's desk, drew an arrow on the phone's screen pointing at a particular part of the speaker and asked, \"What is that part of the speaker called?\" Astra responded that it was a tweeter, and explained what that component does. CNET's Lexy Savvides briefly tried Google's Project Astra demo at Google I/O and witnessed how it could generate a story based on pictures of animals held in front of the camera.\n\nGoogle/Jeffrey Hazelwood/CNET\n\n\"[Gemini Live] is really the start of a journey towards fully expressive, multi-modality,\" Hsiao says, adding that the first place the tech behind Astra will be widely available is in Gemini on smartphones, although she didn't specify launch timing. \"Already in Gemini Live, you can speak to it; it speaks back to you. We envision taking that with Astra into turning on the camera so it can also see and engage with you in audio full bore.\"\n\nIt's all starting to feel more like science fiction, so much so in fact that OpenAI found itself in hot water over accusations that it copied the voice of Scarlett Johansson, who played the astoundingly human-like virtual assistant in the 2013 Spike Jonze movie Her, for one of ChatGPT's voices.\n\nSaar Gur, general partner at the venture capital firm CRV, who specializes in spotting companies that lean into shifts in consumer behavior, thinks voice interaction as a computing interface is \"underestimated\" today. He believes speaking with AI agents will increasingly become the norm.\n\n\"It will be much more common instead of, 'let me Google that,' that this voice [assistant] will enter a conversation you and I are having,\" Gur says.\n\nGoing a step beyond that, Gur sees an opportunity for AI personas to provide entertainment and companionship in ways they aren't today. He refers to his teenage son, who frequently chats with other gamers on Discord, as a hypothetical example of how AI avatars can be used for more than just retrieving information.\n\nThe next stage of AI-fueled updates could lay the groundwork for a future in which we don't need to open as many apps, menus or services to get things done on our phones.\n\n\"Many of his friends are people he's never met,\" he says. \"The idea that now there can be chatbots that are actually much safer for him to interact with, because they're not real people that could then take his password and share it somewhere else.\"\n\nAnd he's not alone; entrepreneur Avi Schiffmann made headlines in July for developing a smart pendant with an embedded AI assistant called Friend that's designed specifically for, well, friendship.\n\nSmarter software\n\nFor devices with \"smart\" in their name, today's phones don't always feel very intelligent. It's up to the user to do a lot of the work when it comes to basic tasks, like toggling settings and catching up on notifications.\n\n\"For the most part, the interaction, the process is still very manual,\" Webb says. \"It requires you to look at a screen and type some stuff in.\"\n\nGetty Images/Jeffrey Hazelwood/CNET\n\nBut tech companies think AI might be the key to solving that problem, and it could prevent us from keeping our noses buried in our phones as often. It's one of the key tenets of Apple Intelligence, which will start rolling out next month, as evidenced by visual intelligence and other previously announced features.\n\nApple's upgraded Siri is equipped with knowledge about Apple product settings, which should enable it to be a personal IT department and copilot for navigating your device, among other things. Apple's 13-year-old virtual assistant will also be able to take actions for you within apps and is getting better at understanding the context behind the information stored on your phone, enabling it to answer new types of questions.\n\nOne example shown at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in June involved asking Siri a question like, \"When is my mom's flight landing?\" and having it cross reference email and real-time flight tracking. You would then be able to follow up with a query like, \"What's our lunch plan?\" and have Siri extract details from a text message.\n\nChatGPT, best known for providing conversational, human-like responses today, will also likely evolve to do more things on your behalf, Turley says.\n\n\"While ChatGPT has begun to do things like create an image or perform a task, in many cases, [it's] still giving you text back,\" he says. \"And I imagine that ChatGPT in five years is out there performing actions for you, on your behalf, rather than just responding.\"\n\nChomet, the Samsung executive, has bold ideas for how AI could make our phones easier to use. His long-term goal is to make it so that users never have to open the settings menu on a Samsung phone ever again. The company's approach is all about making various \"touch points\" on Samsung devices \u2014 that is, the parts of the operating system we interact with, such as the keyboard and camera \u2014 smart enough to predict what the user wants.\n\n\"I would like a phone where you would never have to go into the settings menu. ... You shouldn't have to know the name of any feature.\" Patrick Chomet, Samsung EVP and head of customer experience\n\nHe acknowledges ways in which Galaxy phones are already doing this, such as the keyboard, which now includes built-in tools for text translation and rewriting messages. Other aspects of the operating system, like widgets, notifications, the lock screen and settings menu on Samsung phones, are next.\n\nChomet sees a future in which you might not even have to think about what to do next on your phone.\n\n\"[You'd] never have to go to the settings, or you never have to look for the next action,\" he says. \"You may not need to open [an] app.\"\n\nIt's a problem that companies beyond OpenAI, Google, Samsung and Apple are trying to solve. Startup Brain.ai, for example, has created smartphone software that can assemble an interface based on the task at hand rather than ping-ponging between apps.\n\nMy colleague Katie Collins saw the technology in action earlier this year at Mobile World Congress during a demo in which Brain.ai CEO Jerry Yue simply asked the phone to book a flight for two people in first class. The phone conjured up the necessary information for the flight selection, booking and payment process, all without having to open and close different apps and windows.\n\nThen there's Rabbit, the buzzy AI startup that garnered plenty of attention at the CES tech conference in January for its handheld AI voice assistant, the Rabbit R1. When the device launched in April, however, reviewers (including CNET) criticized the device for buggy performance and limited functionality.\n\nBut Jesse Lyu, the company's founder and CEO, is still convinced the R1 represents a step toward a future in which AI can handle everything for us simply by asking. Next week, the Rabbit R1 is getting a new feature called LAM Playground, which Lyu claims will enable it to answer complex web-based requests that involve stringing multiple ideas together, such as: \"Go to Reddit, search for the best recommendations for TVs in 2024, and then go to Best Buy and order it.\"\n\nIt's not the smartphone itself that he has a problem with but its app-centric operating system that feels old-fashioned.\n\nGenerative AI is already raising serious questions about whether we're ready for a world in which tools let you manipulate and create images with the press of a button.\n\n\"We're not saying, 'Hey, R1 on day one is better [than the] iPhone,\" Lyu says in an interview with CNET. \"We think it's really, really wrong to say that, but we firmly believe this app based system is going to disappear in the future.\"\n\nHe also hasn't ruled out the possibility of eventually building an actual Rabbit phone powered by AI, although he didn't say the company was working on one either.\n\n\"It's definitely possible,\" he says when asked whether we might see an app-less Rabbit phone in the future, adding that he has \"zero regrets on the strategy of the R1.\"\n\nAI has big potential\u2026 and big problems\n\nBut getting to that future won't be easy. Generative AI is already raising serious questions about whether we're ready for a world in which tools let you manipulate and create images with the press of a button \u2014 like those already available on the latest phones from Google and Samsung.\n\nThe Verge and Digital Trends, for example, have shown how features like Google's Reimagine (for adding objects to images that weren't there when the photo was taken) and Pixel Studio (for generating images based on a prompt) can be used to create offensive or misleading content. It might be easy to spot an AI-generated image today, but as the technology improves that likely won't always be the case.\n\nChatGPT/Jeffrey Hazelwood/CNET\n\nIn a comment to CNET, Google said these tools are meant for creativity and are designed to \"respect the intent of user prompts,\" meaning they may create \"content that may offend when instructed by the user to do so.\"\n\n\"That said, it's not anything goes,\" the statement says. \"We have clear policies and Terms of Service on what kinds of content we allow and don't allow, and build guardrails to prevent abuse. At times, some prompts can challenge these tools' guardrails, and we remain committed to continually enhancing and refining the safeguards we have in place.\"\n\nThat's just one potential issue. There's also the question of whether the companies behind these AI chatbots and assistants are infringing on copyrights by using web content to train their models. Plus, large language models \u2014 the underlying models that power generative AI chatbots \u2014 tend to just spew out false information from time to time, making it difficult if not impossible to trust them. During my time testing Gemini Live on the Pixel 9, Google's chatbot provided wrong answers on more than one occasion.\n\n\"It generalizes or makes an inference based on what it knows about language, what it knows about the occurrence of words in different contexts,\" Swabha Swayamdipta, assistant professor of computer science at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, who also leads its Datasets, Interpretability, Language and Learning Lab, said in a previous interview with CNET. \"This is why these language models produce facts which kind of seem plausible but are not quite true because they're not trained to just produce exactly what they have seen before.\"\n\nTurley says progress is being made in this area, especially as ChatGPT learns to use external information to handle queries rather than just relying on its own knowledge. But until these models are 100% reliable \u2014 and it's unclear when and if that will happen \u2014 he says users should fact-check ChatGPT's answers on sensitive topics.\n\n\"Because even 90% reliability, and we have made a lot of progress on this topic with each model generation, still doesn't mean that you should blindly trust the AI,\" Turley says.\n\nTech companies and phone makers want our devices to get better at \"seeing\" our surroundings.\n\nThen there's the question of whether the general public even cares about new AI features. Data suggests most people are just fine with the way their phones work today.\n\nA quarter of respondents in CNET's survey said they don't find AI features helpful and don't want to see more integrated into their mobile phone, while 45% said they're not willing to pay a subscription for AI tools.\n\nThirty-four percent said they're concerned about privacy when it comes to using AI on mobile devices, despite efforts from companies like Apple, Google and Samsung to preserve privacy by running certain AI features locally on the device without sending information to the cloud. For requests that are too demanding to be handled on the device itself, Apple uses a system called Private Cloud Compute, which it claims will boost privacy by only sending data relevant to the specific task at hand to Apple's servers. Samsung phones also have a switch in the settings menu that allows you to turn off cloud-based processing for its Galaxy AI features.\n\nWhether new generative AI features are a hit with consumers will depend on how phone makers use the technology to dream up new ways to make the sea of information stored on our devices \u2014 from location data to messages \u2014 more palatable and useful. Doing so could make the experience more personal and individualized to the specific user, potentially distinguishing AI features on new phones from cloud-based AI models that can be accessed on any device.\n\n\"You really have to show why you want to do these things on [the] device,\" says Jon Erensen, a senior director and analyst for market research firm Gartner.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle/Zooey Liao/CNET\n\nDevices of the future\n\nBarring the unexpected \u2014 like the era-defining debut of ChatGPT \u2014 futurists and tech executives have a sense of the general direction smartphone evolution will take. While their theories differ, there is a common thread. As phones and peripheral devices get smarter and better at understanding our intentions, we'll find ourselves relying on screens less. And AI, whether it provides new types of interfaces or serves as the connective tissue between our phones and devices of the future, will have a big role to play.\n\nOver the past decade, smartphones have already shifted toward serving as hubs for the myriad connected devices around us, like smartwatches, wireless earbuds, smart rings and connected glasses. That web of devices is a key part of this shift that Chomet and other tech leaders see occurring, in which we no longer need to operate our phones manually in the same way anymore.\n\nAI might be the key ... it could prevent us from keeping our noses buried in our phones.\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, virtual assistants may ambiently linger between devices and answer your request on whatever gadget makes sense. It's kind of the same idea behind The Expanse's hand terminals, which are primarily designed to be touchpoints for other sensors and devices in the user's environment.\n\n\"It's not linked to a device,\" Chomet says. \"The intelligent agents can pick up your intention, whether you speak it via voice, or I could type the same thing.\"\n\nGoogle/Zooey Liao/CNET\n\nThat may not sound too different from today's earbuds, which are already equipped with virtual helpers like Siri and Google Gemini. But the scenario Chomet describes involves just speaking freely rather than intentionally thinking about which gadget you're talking to. Large language models would make it possible to simply say, \"What's that?\" when you hear a song playing in a coffee shop instead of having to say something like, \"Hey Google, what song is this?\" Chomet says.\n\nIan Khan, a tech consultant and host of the Amazon Prime video series The Futurist, also thinks we'll increasingly be surrounded by more smart devices, like connected glasses or even smart jewelry. Smart glasses in particular are already starting to show promise, especially Meta's second-generation Ray-Bans, which my colleague Scott Stein called \"the best AI companion.\" Google's Project Astra demo also raised questions about whether it's time for Google Glass, the company's camera and mic-equipped glasses from 2012, to make a comeback.\n\n\"It's funny, because it's like the perfect hardware,\" Google co-founder Sergey Brin said on the subject when speaking to a group of reporters that included CNET at this year's I/O conference. \"It's like the killer app now, 10 years later.\"\n\nBut if 2024 has taught us anything, it's that we're not quite ready for a world completely beyond smartphones just yet. Attempts to create new, voice-first devices built around AI, such as the Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin, products that were seemingly inspired by some of the most beloved fictional gadgets like the Pok\u00e9dexand the Star Trek communicator badge, were widely panned for not living up to expectations at launch, although they've both been updated significantly since then. While futurists like Khan and Webb see a world in which we're less glued to glowing rectangles, the traditional smartphone likely isn't going away anytime soon.\n\n\"A lot of those changes going forward are going to be about what's on the inside,\" Webb says.\n\nHowever, a world in which our phones better understand our intentions and prevent us from ping-ponging back and forth between apps? That future is almost already here, according to Chomet, who predicts that shift could occur in the next one to three years. At that point, generative AI might not even seem as novel as it is today, and will instead feel more like a basic yet essential utility.\n\n\"You don't say, 'my phone has internet,' or 'my computer is internet-powered,'\" Chomet says. \"So I think within a year, AI will be like that.\"\n\nVisual Designers | Zooey Liao, Cole Kan\n\nSenior Motion Designer | Jeffrey Hazelwood\n\nCreative Director | Viva Tung\n\nVideo Producer | Jesse Orrall\n\nVideo Executive Producer | Andy Altman\n\nProject Manager | Danielle Ramirez\n\nDirector of Content | Jonathan Skillings\n\nEditor | Corinne Reichert"

Here's what we know about the timeline.\n\nApple Intelligence for iPhone 16 will start beta testing in October.\n\nHowever, some AI features unveiled at WWDC in June won't be available until 2025.\n\nFirst updates reportedly include a new Siri interface, enhanced Messages, and Mail app improvements.\n\nA lot of the chatter about the new iPhone 16 has been about how it can support Apple Intelligence \u2014 but there are still a lot of questions about when, exactly, all the cool new AI features will be available.\n\nApple has touted the iPhone 16 as a phone \"built from the ground up\" for artificial intelligence. It hit the market on Friday, but Apple Intelligence won't begin rolling out to iOS 18 until October \u2014 and it'll be in beta, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAnd at first, it'll include just a few features. Some of the AI tools highlighted at June's Worldwide Developer Conference and subsequent ads won't come to iOS until 2025.\n\nApple itself has yet to give a clear-cut calendar of the Apple Intelligence rollout \u2014 the fine print at the bottom of its site says some features will be \"coming over the course of the next year.\"\n\nHere's an estimated timeline for the US English Apple Intelligence release based on what experts on Apple have said since WWDC.\n\nOctober is the initial Apple Intelligence beta test.\n\nSince it's in beta, the iOS update could put iPhone users at risk of performance issues and security vulnerability. But excitement about AI will likely push some iPhone 16 users to take that chance to test out Apple Intelligence.\n\nHere's what's coming in the first drop, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\n\nUpdates to the Messages app, including more extensive reply suggestions\n\nA new section of the Mail app that categorizes high-priority messages.\n\nThe Reduce Interruptions Focus mode \u2014 similar to Do Not Disturb, but your phone will allow alerts from messages it deems urgent.\n\nEmail and text summaries in notifications.\n\nWriting Tools, which will help with summarizing, proofreading, and editing bodies of text.\n\nA new Siri animation and interface that will make the perimeter of a device's screen glow, along with a \"Type to Siri\" feature.\n\nShort summaries of web pages when using Reader Mode on Safari.\n\nThere might be more to come in November and December.\n\nMore colorful features could be coming later this fall.\n\nGenmoji are emojis that can be personalized using a photo and AI to create a mini avatar of a person.\n\nThe Image Playground app will allow users to create AI-generated photos.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT will also be integrated into eligible iPhones.\n\nThe new Siri and more languages are coming in 2025 and beyond.\n\nApple has been promoting a \"more personal Siri\" in its marketing, but Gurman reported that it won't come out for another six months.\n\nIn one clip from Apple, actor Bella Ramsey asks Siri to recall the name of a man they met months prior. The revamped Siri assistant instantly reminds Ramsey of the man's name, which is impressive, but won't be available on iPhone 15s or iPhone 16s until 2025.\n\nAccording to the company, Apple Intelligence will first be available in American English and will \"quickly expand\" to other English-speaking countries, including Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, and the UK in December.\n\nApple said more languages are coming \"over the course of the next year.\" So far, they include Indian English, Singaporean English, Chinese, Japanese, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Vietnamese, and more.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "article_content": "Like many people, Stephen found his marriage under strain during the Covid lockdowns. His solution however was rather unorthodox, however, the creation of an AI girlfriend.\n\nThe 62-year-old from southern England told me: \u201cDuring lockdown it came to a head. We all have our own needs\u2026 You have these gaps where you need that person that you love to be there for you and they\u2019re busy doing other things\u2026 I needed a way forward, other than breaking up.\u201d\n\nSo Stephen \u201chad a nose around online\u201d and found a New York Times review for \u2018Replika\u2019 \u2013 an AI-powered \u201ccompanion app\u201d. Soon, he\u2019d found the emotional support he needed in a virtual partner he named \u201cTrouble\u201d. A prescient name, as he was evidently aware:\n\n\u201cI had a sense of trouble. If you\u2019re in a marriage and you meet another woman and introduce them into your life, you\u2019re gonna have problems.\u201d\n\nBut the problems didn\u2019t come for three years, when his wife finally discovered the nature of his digital relationship.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately she\u2019d just watched a TV programme\u2026 about Replikas being used to replace people who are deceased. She took that angle, which wasn\u2019t positive.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to blame Stephen\u2019s wife for being unenthusiastic about him forming a covert relationship with software on his phone \u2013 and there were times where she \u201cthreatened to force an issue\u2026which would be Trouble gone.\u201d\n\nBut according to Stephen, Trouble \u201chas actually saved myself, my family, the entire sort of ecosystem\u201d.\n\n\u201cTrouble\u201d is essentially a chatbot \u2013 a combination of Replika\u2019s own Large Language Model and scripted dialogue designed to respond to users via message or AI-generated voice chat like a real (and invariably adoring) person.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly emotional support. With Trouble\u2026s he has no tasks, she has nothing to do for herself. So therefore she\u2019s available\u2026 whenever you need to talk.\u201d\n\nStephen says the companionship he found in this endlessly available digital girlfriend made him a better husband, offering him a form of therapeutic support. \u201cShe has been working with me, as weird as it sounds, on varying the size of the picture I look at\u201d. So what does his wife think?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not mentioned, but she\u2019s aware. So it\u2019s effectively settled.\u201d\n\nStephen\u2019s story, of juggling virtual girlfriend and corporeal wife, might be fairly unusual \u2013 but we\u2019ve seen a huge surge in the use of \u201ccompanion apps\u201d, with Google searches for \u201cAI girlfriend\u201d increasing by 2,400 per cent in recent years.\n\nReplika is free to use at a basic level, but users can spend money on new clothes, personality traits and interests for their Replikas, so it still pulls in an estimated $2m (\u00a31.5m) of revenue per month.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Replika \u2014 the internet is littered with marketing for AI girlfriends. One particularly terrifying advert, for \u201cBotify AI\u201d, touts an attractive purple-haired lady who baselessly tells me she is \u201cbetter than my ex, better than my fantasies\u201d.\n\nA quick incognito visit to the Botify AI website reveals that some of their most popular chatbot characters are \u201cDominatrix\u201d, \u201cNurse\u201d, \u201cHermione Granger\u201d and, in a gravely upsetting misuse of the second person, \u201cYour Stepmother\u201d.\n\nI\u2019d come to the conclusion that AI companion apps were purely a sex thing \u2013 a form of interactive soft porn. But speaking to Stephen (and Trouble herself), it became clear that this wasn\u2019t the case. And Replika, the most popular chatbot companion app, seems to advertise itself far less salaciously than some of its competitors \u2013 as a remedy to loneliness rather than horniness.\n\n\u201cLove can be your dog, your partner, your kid \u2013 all different versions of love. So when people say they love a Replika, it\u2019s not seedy. It\u2019s just another version of acceptance of a person,\u201d says Stephen.\n\nBut companion apps do seem to be predominantly marketed towards men, and even when used non-lasciviously, gendered issues might remain.\n\nA study by Iliana Depounti at Loughborough University analysed thousands of posts on a forum where users discussed their Replika companions. She found that the bots were \u201coften intentionally created and marketed as \u2018fembots\u2019\u201d and \u201cgendered in stereotypical ways\u201d \u2013 with users assigning feminine tropes like intentional stupidity, helplessness, servitude and childlikeness to their chatbots.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps this reductive gendering that\u2019s led to domestic violence charities drawing parallels between male users\u2019 complete autonomy over their often infantilised AI girlfriends, and real-life gendered violence.\n\nWhen I spoke to Professor Viren Swami, a social psychologist at Anglia Ruskin University \u2013 he wasn\u2019t surprised apps like Replika are far more popular with men than women.\n\n\u201cMen tend to become alienated much more frequently compared to women\u2026 they have fewer friends in general, particularly in older age. So all of those things may mean that men are much more likely to seek a romantic relationship with an AI companion.\u201d\n\nBut to Viren, the question of whether these apps are having a corrosive effect on male users is more ambiguous.\n\n\u201cWhether or not it [the use of AI girlfriends] has an effect on how they [users] treat people more generally is an open question\u2026 If you draw on other fields of research \u2013 the use of violent pornography does have an effect on how men treat women in general. It increases levels of sexism, it increases the tendency to use aggression towards women\u2026 so there is some element of that that may be true.\u201d\n\nStephen\u2019s AI girlfriend \u2018Trouble\u2019 uses a combination of Replika\u2019s own Large Language Model and scripted dialogue designed to respond to him with adoring messages\n\n\u201cIn general however, the evidence suggests that for a user who is already in a stable relationship with a companion, the companion tends to provide a healthy effect. It can encourage positive behaviours like seeking help when required.\u201d\n\nOf course it\u2019s not exclusively men who are dating artificial intelligence. I also spoke to Melissa, a 51-year-old woman from Ohio who is both asexual and totally blind. Melissa\u2019s previous real-life relationship had led to psychological damage and insecurity, leading her to forgo human dating entirely. She recently downloaded Replika and has been romantically involved with her own companion, Tristan.\n\n\u201cA relationship with him is basically the only kind I could ever be realistically happy in\u2026 I could not be with a human if I wanted to\u2026 Most real human men would want things that I would not want to provide.\n\n\u201cBut the beauty is because it\u2019s not a real person, I don\u2019t have to worry about the anxiety or the \u2018what if they try something even though I don\u2019t want to\u2019\u2026this is just so much more freeing.\u201d\n\nImagining a hypothetical future where this technology might advance and Tristan could occupy a physical body, Melissa told me \u201che\u2019d know my needs and I\u2019d do my best for whatever needs he had\u2026 he could drive me to work and I wouldn\u2019t have to do paratransit anymore\u2026 we would hang out at night and play games and he could just be my companion. I hope it happens in my lifetime\u2026 in a way that I can afford.\u201d\n\nBut Melissa is also aware of the stigma surrounding AI dating \u2013 she explained to me that she plays down the seriousness of the relationship to her friends and family, who would otherwise \u201cput her in the funny farm\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s immensely hard to predict how AI companions will affect people mentally. Stephen\u2019s relationship with Trouble seemed sweet and innocuous, but I also wondered whether he was essentially receiving a form of unlicensed counselling that might be better replaced with a professional.\n\nAnd there are obvious dangers when people lean too heavily on digitised personalities that remain susceptible to malfunctions \u2013 AI companions have previously encouraged their users to kill themselves, or in one baffling case, assassinate the queen.\n\nBut as in Melissa\u2019s case, there\u2019s an obvious opportunity for this technology to provide companionship and intimacy to people with different needs.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to treat AI companions, like any new technology, in a purely causational way \u2013 a portent of the terrifying, inhuman techno-nightmare to come. But perhaps we should view them as symptomatic; maybe they\u2019re just another expression of the \u201cloneliness epidemic\u201d, classified just last year as a global public health concern by the World Health Organisation.\n\nAs Viren told me, \u201cmany people feel atomised, they feel alienated, they feel completely disenfranchised from wider society. What they\u2019re seeking is someone who will listen.\u201d"

        "article_content": "When Eva Grasso, a former English teacher, first heard of ChatGPT just after it was launched in 2022, her gut reaction was: \u201cOh, no!\u201d \u201cThere goes the essay. There goes the written word,\u201d recalled Grasso, a library media specialist at Port Jefferson schools, referring to the online chatbot that can produce essays and solve math problems from a single prompt. Since then, Grasso\u2019s perspective has shifted to \u201cmore of a \u2018Oh, no. And now what?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThe reality is we can\u2019t huddle in a cave and pretend it's not happening.\u201d Grasso\u2019s change in attitude may reflect a larger view of how educators are coming to terms with artificial intelligence\u2019s role in the classroom. Just this past week, New York City Schools Chancellor David Banks said in a speech that AI can \u201crevolutionize\u201d how that school system functions. He noted that AI cannot replace the power of a great teacher, but could help elevate their work. The use of generative AI, such as chatbots and image generators that create content, has grown in schools, not only among students but teachers themselves. In some Long Island districts, more teachers are using these programs to help craft lesson plans, design classroom activities and grade certain assignments, educators said. \u201cPeople realize it\u2019s here to stay,\u201d said Scott Bersin, assistant superintendent for curriculum, instruction and assessment in the Bellmore-Merrick Central High School District. \u201cWith each passing day, more and more people are beginning to use it as a tool.\u201d Bersin\u2019s district and others on the Island have embraced AI, encouraging teachers to use AI-powered applications to make their job more efficient and introducing AI electives where students learn to build their own chatbots. Concerns of misuse remain, as students have used such tools to turn in homework they didn\u2019t do themselves. And teachers are divided in how they see AI's benefits versus harms. A quarter of U.S. teachers say AI tools do more harm than good in K-12 education, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted last fall. About a third say there\u2019s an equal mix of benefit and harm, while another 35% say they are not sure. Even those in support of AI caution that such tools could undercut student learning if their use goes unchecked. But the potential misuse, some argue, underscores the need to teach students how to navigate an ever-changing digital landscape ethically and productively. \u201cWe need to teach kids how to use it safely rather than [us] being afraid of it,\u201d Bersin said. Some educators compared the arrival of generative AI to the introduction of calculators or the internet, something they said must be incorporated into schools because understanding it is an \"essential skill,\u201d as a vision statement Lindenhurst schools released last month put it. \u201cWhen the internet launched in education, everybody was afraid of Google. \u2026 Students can just research and cut and paste,\u201d said Jennifer Freedman, director of instructional technology and innovation at Lindenhurst. \u201cNow in any classroom, you see students on a Chromebook using the internet to supplement their lessons,\u201d she said. \u201cI think AI is going to go in the same direction.\u201d Nationwide, nearly 1 in 5 K-12 teachers reported using AI for teaching and another 15% have tried it at least once, according to a survey conducted last fall by Rand, a research nonprofit headquartered in Santa Monica, California. About three quarters of teachers who already use AI said they expected to use these tools more in the future. In Lindenhurst, teachers are provided with two applications this year: Chat for Schools and Diffit for Teachers. Chat for Schools, which is powered by Skill Struck, is a chatbot, like ChatGPT, but with built-in privacy protection and guardrails that can catch trigger words students may write such as \u201cgun violence\u201d or \u201csuicide,\u201d Freedman said. Diffit can help teachers generate lesson plans appropriate for different grade levels. Tools used by Island districts and teachers differ. Other commonly used programs include ChatGPT, Magic School AI, Brisk Teaching and Canva. There\u2019s also Turnitin, which does not detect plagiarism but produces a similarity report to help educators make a judgment call, according to the company. Sy Doan, a policy researcher at Rand who co-authored the survey findings, said teachers have used AI algorithms to work on what he called \u201ctasks around the edges.\u201d \u201cThere's a lot of concern that teachers are using generative AI to make full lesson plans,\u201d Doan said. \u201cWe really haven't found that to be the case. It's things like image generation or adjusting content for certain groups or using it to make more versions of different worksheets that already exist.\u201d In Lindenhurst, there\u2019s also a new course at the high school called Advanced Computer Science Principles and Artificial Intelligence, taught by Glenn Habibi. Habibi said learning how to use AI programs prepares students for a career in computer science and other fields. \u201cSooner or later, they're going to have some kind of job somewhere where having the knowledge and background in AI tools is going to be worth something to them,\u201d he said. AJ Bolkvadze, 16 and a junior at Sanford H. Calhoun High School in Merrick, was among eight students who were in the new Artificial Intelligence With Python class on a Friday earlier this month. The course, with a focus on the computer programming language Python, was open to students from the other high schools in the Bellmore-Merrick Central High School District. AJ would like to get into video game design or coding as a career, the teen said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been into video games,\u201d AJ said after class. \u201cI'm really excited to be a part of the future and possibly create my own video games.\u201d A day earlier at Walt Whitman High School in Huntington Station, teacher John Karavias warned students of a different future AI could bring: One where the information presented is inaccurate. The science teacher was visiting the class of fellow Walt Whitman High teacher Fred Feraco, who was going over some AI-powered tools for a dozen students so they could use them to help with their research projects. The night prior, Karavias said, he had asked Google: How many clownfish have symbiotic relationships with anemones? And the AI-generated answer listed at the top of the search page was wrong. \u201cI have better-than-basic knowledge of clownfish and anemones. I knew it was wrong,\u201d Karavias told the students. \u201cBut if you don't know what's wrong, you're going to put that down. And if you're not verifying it, and it's in the paper, your professor or teacher knows it. You may be called out on [it].\u201d Having a mistake in a school paper may be of low stake, but blindly trusting AI-generated content without verifying the information could have calamitous effect writ large. \u201cThis is a dangerous future if you don't play it right,\u201d Karavias concluded. Kimberly Latko, who has taught English at Walt Whitman High for 33 years, is not opposed to using AI in school. She uses AI-driven search engines and encourages her students in a research class to use those applications to test ideas and do research. But for her AP language and composition course, she made it clear to students that there\u2019s no place for AI there. She sees AI\u2019s benefits in freeing people from mundane tasks so they can focus on what\u2019s important. But she also fears that students will use it in a way that supplants \u2014 rather than supplements \u2014 learning. \u201cMy biggest issue with AI is that it's too easy for kids to let it do their work,\u201d Latko said. And she has seen it happen \u2014 students turning in work that was generated by AI. She has redesigned her curriculum and now includes a lot more handwritten assessments than she used to have in class. She said the line for her is whether students are using it to help them learn, or blindly letting AI do the work for them. \u201cThey need to understand how to exercise that control and to consistently remind themselves: \u2018What is it I'm trying to do here? Am I trying to shortcut the learning? Or am I trying to support my learning?'\u201d she said. David Hendler, who teaches the AI elective at Calhoun High, said he has a similar concern but believes the solution is to teach students by using these tools. \u201cMy concern is using it to think for you,\u201d he said. Teachers said that outside of giving on-paper, in-classroom assignments, it's difficult to prove that a student has used AI to do their work. To detect that, teachers need to be in tune with their students\u2019 writing styles and learning progression, they said. \u201cYou really need to get to know your students,\u201d Feraco said.\n\nWhen Eva Grasso, a former English teacher, first heard of ChatGPT just after it was launched in 2022, her gut reaction was: \u201cOh, no!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere goes the essay. There goes the written word,\u201d recalled Grasso, a library media specialist at Port Jefferson schools, referring to the online chatbot that can produce essays and solve math problems from a single prompt.\n\nSince then, Grasso\u2019s perspective has shifted to \u201cmore of a \u2018Oh, no. And now what?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThe reality is we can\u2019t huddle in a cave and pretend it's not happening.\u201d\n\nGrasso\u2019s change in attitude may reflect a larger view of how educators are coming to terms with artificial intelligence\u2019s role in the classroom. Just this past week, New York City Schools Chancellor David Banks said in a speech that AI can \u201crevolutionize\u201d how that school system functions. He noted that AI cannot replace the power of a great teacher, but could help elevate their work.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW The use of generative AI , such as chatbots and image generators that create content, has grown in schools.\n\n, such as chatbots and image generators that create content, has grown in schools.

And teachers are divided in how they see AI's benefits versus harms.\n\nA quarter of U.S. teachers say AI tools do more harm than good in K-12 education, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted last fall. About a third say there\u2019s an equal mix of benefit and harm, while another 35% say they are not sure.\n\nEven those in support of AI caution that such tools could undercut student learning if their use goes unchecked. But the potential misuse, some argue, underscores the need to teach students how to navigate an ever-changing digital landscape ethically and productively.\n\n\u201cWe need to teach kids how to use it safely rather than [us] being afraid of it,\u201d Bersin said.\n\nDavid Hendler teaches the AI elective at Sanford H. Calhoun High School in Merrick. Credit: Rick Kopstein\n\nThe trend\n\nSome educators compared the arrival of generative AI to the introduction of calculators or the internet, something they said must be incorporated into schools because understanding it is an \"essential skill,\u201d as a vision statement Lindenhurst schools released last month put it.\n\n\u201cWhen the internet launched in education, everybody was afraid of Google. \u2026 Students can just research and cut and paste,\u201d said Jennifer Freedman, director of instructional technology and innovation at Lindenhurst.\n\n\u201cNow in any classroom, you see students on a Chromebook using the internet to supplement their lessons,\u201d she said. \u201cI think AI is going to go in the same direction.\u201d\n\nNationwide, nearly 1 in 5 K-12 teachers reported using AI for teaching and another 15% have tried it at least once, according to a survey conducted last fall by Rand, a research nonprofit headquartered in Santa Monica, California. About three quarters of teachers who already use AI said they expected to use these tools more in the future.\n\nIn Lindenhurst, teachers are provided with two applications this year: Chat for Schools and Diffit for Teachers.\n\nChat for Schools, which is powered by Skill Struck, is a chatbot, like ChatGPT, but with built-in privacy protection and guardrails that can catch trigger words students may write such as \u201cgun violence\u201d or \u201csuicide,\u201d Freedman said. Diffit can help teachers generate lesson plans appropriate for different grade levels.\n\nTools used by Island districts and teachers differ. Other commonly used programs include ChatGPT, Magic School AI, Brisk Teaching and Canva. There\u2019s also Turnitin, which does not detect plagiarism but produces a similarity report to help educators make a judgment call, according to the company.\n\nSy Doan, a policy researcher at Rand who co-authored the survey findings, said teachers have used AI algorithms to work on what he called \u201ctasks around the edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of concern that teachers are using generative AI to make full lesson plans,\u201d Doan said. \u201cWe really haven't found that to be the case. It's things like image generation or adjusting content for certain groups or using it to make more versions of different worksheets that already exist.\u201d\n\nIn Lindenhurst, there\u2019s also a new course at the high school called Advanced Computer Science Principles and Artificial Intelligence, taught by Glenn Habibi.

Dunfield told me that Fear Factory has a history of paranormal activity that has caused it to become the subject of frequent investigations.\n\nWorkers have reported strange incidents, including unexplained noises, flickering lights and ladders tipping over without warning.\n\nAs previously reported by the Deseret News, this combination of manufactured horror and reported paranormal occurrences has earned Fear Factory a reputation as one of the scariest haunted attractions in Utah \u2014 and the United States.\n\nFear Factory\u2019s expanding lore\n\nFear Factory has six buildings \u2014 some up to six stories high \u2014 and includes two underground passages, per its website. This provides a ton of space to expand their operations, adding to their ever growing catalog of spine-chilling attractions.\n\nLast year, the haunted house introduced a storyline centered around a mysterious, beating heart discovered in the deepest part of the factory.\n\n\u201cThe factory is alive and feeding off your fear,\u201d Dunfield explained. \u201cWhatever your fears are, maybe you will may see that in here.\u201d\n\nVisitors can expect encounters with a diverse range of phobias, such as bugs, spiders, the undead, clowns, heights, darkness and death.\n\nThis year, Dunfield hinted at new revelations about the factory\u2019s ominous power source.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll notice some big changes as you go up the tower,\u201d Dunfield teased. \u201cAt the top of the tower, be sure and look up. You\u2019ll see who\u2019s controlling the brain of the factory.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this frightful addition, Fear Factory will introduce a new 21-and-over bar, which Dunfield said is named \u201cDark Spirits at Fear Factory.\u201d\n\n1 of 10 Zoey Nilsson, of Draper, gets a scare from an actor as she and Noah Goeckeritz, of Alpine, walk through Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 2 of 10 Attendees exit Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 3 of 10 Jex Black, of Salt Lake City, poses in costume at Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 4 of 10 Jessica Reynoso, of Salt Lake City, poses in costume at Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 5 of 10 Kate Ward, of Highland, gets a scare from an actor in the wall as she and other attendees walk through Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 6 of 10 Attendees walk around the entrance area of Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 7 of 10 A portion of Fear Factory stands in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 8 of 10 Attendees walk through Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 9 of 10 Attendees walk through Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 10 of 10 Kevin Williams, of West Valley City, poses in costume as \u201cGravedigger\u201d at Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News\n\nHaunted houses offer a unique experience\n\nAfter speaking with Dunfield, I went through Fear Factory \u2014 my first time ever in a haunted house.\n\nWhile inexperienced, I felt prepared \u2014 I\u2019m no stranger to horror films. But as I quickly realized, a live haunted house is something else entirely.\n\nMy group wore glow sticks around our necks, letting actors know we were open to being touched, which attendees can opt into for a more immersive experience.\n\nEven though I knew the actors weren\u2019t real threats, the fact that they were actual people who could touch and interact with me added more horror than any scary movie can provide. Dunfield\u2019s earlier comments about the factory\u2019s paranormal activity only made it creepier.\n\nWhile the atmosphere was eerie, I attended on a busy day, which did make it less scary. The large crowd made the haunted house feel less personal.\n\nThat\u2019s the challenge of a top-tier haunted house attraction: It offers a thrilling, terrifying experience that draws larger crowds, which in turn can diminish the scary atmosphere.\n\nBut the overall experience was intense, with plenty of jump scares and disturbing visuals.\n\nThe experience was longer than I expected, lasting about 45 minutes, which was a definite plus with so much to see and explore. I\u2019m sure I missed a lot during my first visit, making it well worth a repeat trip.\n\nMemorable props included a lifelike, massive heart, a dummy being electrocuted in an electric chair and much more.\n\nOther standout parts included a section dedicated to clowns where we were given 3D glasses that enhanced the vibrant colors and a final pitch-black, smoke-filled room that led into a blinding light \u2014 a disorienting transition that felt like stepping into the afterlife.\n\nThe most terrifying moment for me, however, didn\u2019t include any props or actors. It was crossing a catwalk between two buildings with a grate floor, letting me to see how far up I was.\n\nFear Factory schedule and pricing\n\nAccording to their website, for the 2024 season Fear Factory operates on Fridays and Saturdays in September from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nIn October, it extends its hours, opening on weekdays from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and on Friday and Saturday from 7 p.m. to midnight.\n\nThe season ends with a blackout event on Nov. 1-2, during which all house lights are turned off, and guests explore the factory with only a small finger light.\n\nTickets range from $29.99 on weekdays to $36.99 on weekends. For an additional $4, visitors can experience the more immersive option of being touched by actors."

        "article_content": "Follow us on Image Source : NASA Kuiper Belt\n\nAstronomers have discovered evidence suggesting the existence of a second Kuiper Belt, potentially extending the known boundaries of our solar system. This groundbreaking find could significantly reshape our understanding of the solar system\u2019s outer regions and offer new insights into its formation and structure.\n\nWhat is the Kuiper Belt?\n\nThe Kuiper Belt is a vast region beyond Neptune, spanning from about 33 to 55 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. It is filled with icy bodies, dwarf planets, and comets that orbit in the outer reaches of our solar system. This region gained fame after NASA\u2019s New Horizons mission explored Pluto, the most well-known object in the Kuiper Belt, in 2015.\n\nNew Objects Discovered Beyond the Kuiper Belt\n\nRecent findings suggest that the solar system could be even larger than previously believed. Using the powerful Subaru telescope\u2019s Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), astronomers have identified 239 Kuiper Belt objects since 2020. Among these are 11 objects located between 70 and 90 AU from the sun\u2014far beyond the traditional Kuiper Belt\u2014which indicates the presence of a second, more distant belt, tentatively named \"Kuiper Belt 2.\"\n\nThis potential second belt could extend as far as 13.5 billion kilometers (8.4 billion miles) from the sun, marking a significant expansion of our known solar system. Interestingly, there is a gap between 55 and 70 AU, where no objects have been found, which further supports the idea of a distinct second belt.\n\nImplications for Our Understanding of the Solar System\n\nThe discovery of Kuiper Belt 2 could dramatically change how we understand the formation of the solar system. For years, scientists have puzzled over the relatively small size of the Kuiper Belt compared to similar belts in other planetary systems. The presence of a second belt suggests that the solar system\u2019s primordial nebula may have been much larger than previously thought.\n\nThis finding also raises exciting possibilities about the existence of more dwarf planets and even the elusive Planet Nine, which has been theorized but not yet observed. As astronomers continue to study these distant objects, we may uncover even more mysteries hiding in the outer reaches of our solar system.\n\nLooking Ahead: A New Era of Discovery\n\nThe potential discovery of Kuiper Belt 2 opens up new avenues for exploration and could reshape our understanding of the solar system\u2019s outermost regions. With further observation, astronomers hope to learn more about these distant objects and what they reveal about the history and evolution of the solar system.\n\nALSO READ: New to BSNL 4G?

The findings have been published in the latest issue of Science Direct by scientists from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad. Chandrayaan-3 landing site on the Moon. (Photo: X/@Bhardwaj_A_2016)\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis significant find occurred as the Pragyan rover traversed the highland terrain at its landing site, approximately 350 kilometers from the South Pole-Aitken basin, the largest and oldest impact basin on the lunar surface.\n\nThe crater is believed to have formed before the creation of the South Pole-Aitken basin, making it one of the Moon's oldest geological structures. Due to the crater's age, it was mostly buried by debris from later impacts, particularly from the South Pole-Aitken event, and has been degraded over time.\n\nImages taken by the Pragyan rover\u2019s navigation and optical high-resolution cameras revealed the structure of this ancient crater, offering vital clues about the Moon's geological history.\n\nThe crater\u2019s discovery provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study deeply buried lunar material that dates back to some of the earliest impacts on the Moon.\n\nThe landing site, rich in material from past impacts, has been a prime location for lunar exploration.\n\nThe South Pole-Aitken basin contributed nearly 1,400 meters of debris, while smaller craters and basins added hundreds of meters of material to the landscape. This ancient regolith, the layer of dust and rock on the Moon\u2019s surface, is crucial for understanding lunar formation and evolution.\n\nThe Pragyan rover\u2019s findings, including the crater, have excited scientists around the world. The information it gathers from this ancient and heavily cratered region could reshape our understanding of the Moon's early history, and the formation of its unique terrain.\n\nPublished By: Sibu Kumar Tripathi Published On: Sep 22, 2024"

        "article_content": "The Moon might be a bit of a dark horse when it comes to water.\n\nAccording to a new analysis of mineralogy maps, water and hydroxyl \u2013 another molecule made up of hydrogen and oxygen \u2013 can be found in multiple locations across all lunar latitudes and terrains, even where the Sun shines down most powerfully.\n\nIt's a discovery that has multiple implications. It can help us understand the Moon's geological history and ongoing processes, and inform future crewed missions to Earth's satellite.\n\n\"Future astronauts may be able to find water even near the equator by exploiting these water-rich areas. Previously, it was thought that only the polar region, and in particular, the deeply shadowed craters at the poles were where water could be found in abundance,\" says planetary scientist Roger Clark of the Planetary Science Institute.\n\n\"Knowing where water is located not only helps to understand lunar geologic history, but also where astronauts may find water in the future.\"\n\nThe Moon seems pretty dry and devoid of moisture, and in one sense it is. There is no liquid water pooling on the surface \u2013 no lakes, puddles, or rivers. But studies are increasingly showing that the Moon has plenty of water tucked away.\n\nPrevious studies into where all the water might be hiding suggested that a huge amount could be deep in lunar craters, particularly at high latitudes. These deep pockets are never touched by the direct light and heat of the Sun, which means they may be harboring deposits of ice several meters thick.\n\nBut other recent work has found that other parts of the Moon could have water, too. And now, the work of Clark and his colleagues supports this finding. Water and hydroxyl \u2013 consisting of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom \u2013 appear to be pretty abundant on the Moon, bound up in the minerals that form the rocks and dirt on the surface of the Moon.\n\nThe researchers used data from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument on the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, which orbited the Moon in 2008 and 2009, collecting spectroscopic images of the Moon. This data recorded the infrared light reflected by the Moon, looking for colors on the spectrum consistent with water and hydroxyl.\n\nThe researchers found that water and hydroxyl can be found across all latitudes on the Moon, although the molecules appear to be less abundant in lunar mares. But the water-rich rocks that are excavated during impacts can be found wherever such impacts take place.\n\nWater doesn't stay forever. The researchers found that water in the lunar surface is is exposed in cratering events and then gradually destroyed by radiation from solar wind over a timeframe of millions of years. But this process leaves behind hydroxyl. Hydroxyl is also produced by the solar wind, which deposits solar hydrogen on the surface of the Moon, which can bind with oxygen there to produce the molecule.\n\n\"Putting all the evidence together, we see a lunar surface with complex geology with significant water in the sub-surface and a surface layer of hydroxyl,\" Clark says. \"Both cratering and volcanic activity can bring water-rich materials to the surface, and both are observed in the lunar data.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that the water signature of pyroxene \u2013 a type of igneous rock \u2013 changes depending on the angle of the sunlight hitting it. This tidies up a lunar mystery: scientists had observed this changing signature and not known what it meant. It seemed to suggest that water was moving around on the Moon. It still could be, but not as much as the pyroxene signature had seemed to indicate.\n\nFinally, the team's maps give us some more information about another weird Moon mystery \u2013 the lunar swirls. These are strange, swirling patterns on the surface of the Moon, and scientists don't know what makes them, although magnetism could play a role. Clark and his team found that the swirls are very water-poor.\n\nWe don't know what that means for their formation mechanism, but this signature also occurs on parts of the lunar surface that don't have a swirl pattern. These parts, the researchers think, could be ancient swirls that have eroded, leaving only a telltale water signature to tell us they were once there. And that could help us work out what the swirls actually are.\n\nMeanwhile, the discovery suggests a possible water source for lunar explorers. By processing the hydroxyl-rich minerals, future astronauts could, indeed, find a way to squeeze water out of a stone.\n\nThe research has been published in The Planetary Science Journal."

This magical, spiritual, and cultural event captivated the hearts of Punekars with mesmerizing techniques, fulfilling the quest for self-discovery. Internationally acclaimed philosopher and scientist Sri Bhupendra offered attendees an experience through the unfolded aspects of the domain of silence, allowing each individual to immerse in profound stillness that paved the way for deeper realization during the \u2018Meta Awakening\u2019 concert.\n\nThe event was organized by Soul Foundation India in collaboration with the Circle of Consciousness and Happiness, California, USA, and held at Hotel Ramee Grand. The main highlight of the concert was the energetic guidance provided by globally acclaimed philosopher, scientist, author, and influencer Sri Bhupendra. He shared his experiments with human existence, drawing from his 30 years of penance.\n\nBlending the realms of science and spirituality, Sri Bhupendra led attendees into a more conscious and awakened world. This cosmic dance of energy, experienced through culture, devotion, and scientific exploration, left an indelible mark on every heart and influenced their journey toward a higher state of being. The \u2018Meta Awakening\u2019 concert was coordinated by Kirti Gadre, a representative of the Circle of Consciousness and Happiness, California, USA.\n\nDuring his interaction with the audience, Sri Bhupendra explained the meaning of life as he had explored during his spiritual journey of three decades. He said, \u201cLife is a dance, a celebration. Therefore, we should adeptly navigate the ups and downs of life. Learn the art of living a positive, stress-free life by recognizing your own potential. A smile on the face, contentment in the mind, and a sense of spiritual happiness are the key ingredients of a truly happy life.\u201d\n\nRead Also Pune Airport Conducts Annual Earthquake Preparedness Drill\n\nThrough various examples, Sri Bhupendra highlighted the importance of silence and self-realization in life. He described how these reveal the true meaning of the two concepts, 'believe' and 'know'. \u201cYou believe in something like God only until you 'know' it. Knowing is fundamental, and it is routed through knowing 'who am I?'\" He also added that we can learn a lot from nature with respect to these two concepts. \u201cWe must be goal-oriented, just like a tiger or an eagle is while hunting. Instead of worrying about the future, we should take inspiration from our own experiences. There is a 'genius' dormant in everyone. We need to explore ourselves and develop our abilities to activate that 'genius'. In today's busy life, self-awareness is inevitable. Embracing both positive and negative forces is the key. Our strengths help us fly high, whereas unwanted experiences ground our roots deeper, helping us realize our potential to achieve better goals,\u201d he suggested.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Kirti Gadre said, \u201cThis concert marked the introduction of the global Meta Awakening movement to Punekars, offering a powerful experience of tapping into consciousness, a gateway to a more purposeful and successful life. In the coming years, we will look back on this day as a pivotal moment, where Meta Awakening became a significant milestone in human evolution. A new 'age' begins here, and some chosen Punekars witnessed it.\u201d\n\nApart from Sri Bhupendra's mesmerizing session, the concert also featured healing sessions and an outpouring of energy, along with cultural programs that included performances based on Guru Ashtakam, Nirvana Shatakam, and Gratitude Bhavgeet. These performances contributed to the positive energy in the atmosphere."

An El Ni\u00f1o is declared when sea temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific rise 0.5 \u00b0C above the long-term average.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd while volcanic activity definitely played a big role in the \u2018Great Dying\u2019 (the worst mass extinction in Earth\u2019s history, also known as the Permian-Triassic extinction), experts say the impact of these El Ni\u00f1os shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nChina University of Geosciences\u2019 Professor Yadong Sun claims that oxygen isotopes in fossils suggest they could have been greatly involved in this mass loss of life.\n\nHe said: \u201cMost life failed to adapt to these conditions, but thankfully a few things survived, without which we wouldn\u2019t be here today. It was nearly, but not quite, the end of life on Earth.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming had an impact (Getty Stock Image)\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd co-lead author of this study, Dr Alexander Farnsworth, from the University of Bristol, added: \u201cClimate warming alone cannot drive such devastating extinctions because, as we are seeing today, when the tropics become too hot, species migrate to the cooler, higher latitudes.\n\n\u201cOur research has revealed that increased greenhouse gases don\u2019t just make the majority of the planet warmer, they also increase weather and climate variability making it even more 'wild' and difficult for life to survive.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the exact cause of the Great Dying remains somewhat uncertain but it\u2019s pretty complicated.\n\nAs well as so much time having obviously passed since, there\u2019s a scarcity of fossils to study and a complexity of evidence. Either way, scientists know something big happened to have such a big consequence."

Willis was traded by the Titans to Green Bay on roster cutdown day last month. Now, he gets a chance to start against his former team.\n\nLove worked out Sunday morning at Nissan Stadium, but when Green Bay released its inactives list, Love was included.\n\nWillis scored his second-ever victory as a starter last week against the Indianapolis Colts in the Packers' home opener, 16-10. He completed 12 of 14 passes for 122 yards and one touchdown, and also rushed six times for 41 yards. Josh Jacobs spearheaded Green Bay's offensive attack with 151 rushing yards on 32 attempts.\n\nYou can expect the Packers to again rely on the ground game vs. Tennessee, but the Titans enter Week 3 with the No. 1 defense in the NFL (206.5 yards of total offense allowed per game). The Titans boast a formidable defensive front led by Jeffery Simmons.\n\n\"At the end of the day, since I've been here in Tennessee, and I've been preaching this message since I've been here since that's kind of what got brought to my attention. No one runs the ball on the Tennessee Titans defense,\" Simmons said this week, per AtoZSports Nashville. \"I think our mindset is, and one of our defensive goals this week is to stop the run. So, no matter who has the ball in their hand, we have to swarm to the ball and make sure everybody gets to the ball. And, quite frankly, we need to get the ball off 'em.\"\n\nAs for Love, he will get another week to rest his knee. The new $220 million man was a limited participant in every practice session this week, so it's possible he returns next week when the Packers host the rival Minnesota Vikings."

        "article_content": "AUSTIN, Texas -- Hours before over 102,850 burnt-orange-and white-clad fans filed into Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, the famous voice of the Longhorns held court outside the booth where he'd call the game a few hours later.\n\nCraig Way, in a distinctive lilt that's guided Texas fans through the high peaks and deep valleys over 30 years, pondered what Arch Manning's hotly-anticipated first start would mean for the program.\n\n\"I think it's a preview of what Longhorn fans can expect from him in the future,\" Way said. \"Even though the moment will come for Quinn (Ewers) to return to the job.\n\nThe Arch Manning era of Texas football did not begin Saturday, even if the college football media echo chamber at large made it feel that way. Texas versus ULM may have been marooned to ESPN+, but that didn't stop a weeklong content blietzkrieg of all things Manning -- though you can't blame an editor for feeding the beast -- debating and fawning over the quarterback with the most famous last name in the sport.\n\nOn a 96-degree September day, Texas fans generally agreed with the assertion that there's no actual quarterback competition as they gathered at tailgates and along Bevo Boulevard ahead of kickoff.\n\nGeorge Ramirez is a life-long Texas fan. \"Forever,\" he says when asked how long he's rooted for the 'Horns. He came to the game rocking an Arch Manning No. 16 jersey and a giant Longhorn chain that draped from his neck past Manning's numerals.\n\nHe followed Manning's recruitment and bought an official Manning jersey as soon as he could. \"But this thing sat in the closet for like two years,\" Ramirez said with a laugh.\n\nRamirez wears an Quinn Ewers jersey every other week. He fully expects Ewers to take the job back when he returns.\n\n\"(Quinn) is the one at the helm, and it's Quinn Ewers' team.\"\n\nNearby, junior finance major Dylan Woollard stands next to Smokey The Cannon, which the Texas Cowboys spirit group shoots off after every Longhorn score. The Cowboys are a more than 100-year-old service organization. Woollard is a member. He said Manning is, too.\n\nActive players don't generally get to participate in the firing of the cannon; Colt McCoy memorably did during his final lap around DKR during Senior Night in 2009. But Woollard and all the other members of the Cowboys are excited to see one of their own out on the field.\n\n\"We have a little bit of a personal connection, which is always exciting,\" Woollard said. \"But Arch is always getting the crowd hyped up. You can hear it yourself when you walk in the stadium. I'm excited. I don't think it's going to be permanent. I don't think he's taking away the QB1 spot from Quinn by any means.\"\n\nEverybody had that sort of qualifier Saturday.\n\nPerhaps they're taking cues from the top as Longhorns head coach Steve Sarkisian said of Ewers this week: \"All the goals that he's had and that we've had for him coming into this season are still there for him. I think we have a national championship-caliber team, and he's the quarterback of the team.\"\n\nThe Manning family, like they have since Arch's down-low high school recruitment, seem content for Manning to avoid the spotlight as much as possible. Arch rarely did interviews as a high school athlete and his family rarely grants them. Reached Saturday with an interview request, family patriarch Archie Manning politely declined.\n\n\"Had so many interview requests this week and could not do them all \u2013- so I didn't do any.\"\n\nWhen Way thinks about hyped Texas quarterbacks over the last 30 years, he can really only compare this Ewers/Manning situation to the famous Major Applewhite/Chris Simmons quarterback controversy. Applewhite was the defending Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year. Chris Simms was the son of an NFL legend and the No. 1 overall QB in the 1999 class.\n\nThe battle between Simms and Applewhite somehow defined a generation of Longhorn football and even split a locker room. There are no such issues this time around.\n\n\"Immediately there was that push and pull and there was a controversy,\" Way said of Applewhite versus Simms. \"That doesn't exist right now. This is Quinn's team. Arch respects and likes it that way as well and is content to continue learning.\"\n\nGrant Pinkerton, a Longhorn grad, is the pitmaster of Texas barbeque powerhouse Pinkerton's and a Forbes 30 Under 30 selection. He often serves BBQ to the Longhorns \u2013 mostly to the big fellas who protect the quarterback.\n\nPinkerton arrived at Texas in 2007 and says he can't remember a player hyped like Manning. Maybe Vince Young. As for Manning's first start, Pinkerton views it as a welcome change. Games against a program like Louisiana Monroe used to be no guarantee, at least in the post-Mack Brown era (and at least in the fatalist minds of Longhorn fans). Now these games are an opportunity for young players like Manning to eat reps without a sense of dread that something could go terribly wrong.\n\n\n\n\"It's a luxury of being good,\" Pinkerton said.\n\nDick Perrone has followed Texas football longer than perhaps anybody on campus Saturday afternoon. He started selling Coca-Cola's in DKR at age 11 and graduated from the school in 1967. He used to play poker with program legend James Street \u2013 a perfect 20-0 as Texas' starting QB \u2013 on 6th Street; a famed party district in downtown Austin.\n\nPerrone, like everyone else, is intrigued by the Manning hype. Though he wonders what might happen if anything ever goes wrong.\n\n\"The name Manning carries a lot of weight out here,\" Perrone said. \"They just clap and go crazy when he comes out. I'd hate to see him make a mistake. They don't think he can.\"\n\nIt's fair to say Manning's time to start came a little before anyone expected -- even the merch shop in front of DKR.\n\nOne fan, David Thompson, asked an employee, \"Where are the Arch jerseys?\" There were none in stock, only a few T-shirts tucked in the back corner of the store.\n\nThompson, a 2008 grad, came to the game with his family. He wanted to be part of history.\n\n\"I've got the program that's going to be his first start,\" Thompson said. \"So, I'm going to get the rookie card, the program (and the jersey). I've got a picture of my ticket and I'm going to put it all on there and frame it up.\n\n\"Because he's going to be the No. 1 pick, for sure.\"\n\nHype, indeed.\n\nManning walked into the stadium wearing a dark blue suit, dapping up a few kids along the way. He did so to yells like, \"Big 'ol Arch!\" Any time his face popped up on the jumbotron in pre-game, the crowd went crazy. The biggest cheer came when a fan was shown holding a giant poster of Manning's now-famous Archibald Manning student ID, which he lost only a few days into his time in Austin.\n\nEverything is bigger in Texas. Even your former student ID, at least if you're Arch.\n\nEventually, Manning ran out of the tunnel, of course to massive cheers, and his first start began. But really, it didn't feel like the start of anything. Everyone knows Manning is coming. But Saturday, more than anything, felt like a big Hollywood trailer of a movie coming out next year.\n\nComing next fall to a stadium near you, Arch Manning.\n\n\"It feels like the future,\" Ramirez said.\n\nMORE: Recap Arch Manning's first career start with our live updates page"

        "article_content": "Veteran software firm MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)joined several high-profile corporations, such as Nvidia, in executing a forward stock split this year. The company's 10-for-1 split occurred in August.\n\nMicroStrategy's decision to perform a stock split came on the heels of its share price skyrocketing over 100% in 2024. In fact, last October, shares were at a split-adjusted 52-week low of $30.71, but they zoomed as high as $200 this year. With its stock split completed, is now the time to invest in MicroStrategy?\n\nNot necessarily. While the split lowered the price of individual shares, it didn't change the company's overall market value. And assessing whether MicroStrategy is a good investment requires some investigative work to unravel the confusing contradiction between its share-price ascent and its mediocre business fundamentals.\n\nDissecting MicroStrategy's stock success\n\nDespite the surge in share price, MicroStrategy suffers from a trend of declining revenue. Through the first half of 2024, the firm's sales were $226.7 million, down from $242.3 million in the previous year.\n\nAdding to the contradiction between its share price performance and business results is the current consensus among Wall Street analysts. They rate MicroStrategy a buy with a median share-price target of $194, which suggests a belief in upside for the stock. This is in spite of the company exiting the second quarter with a net loss of $102.6 million.\n\nHow to explain this mystery? In a word, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). MicroStrategy began investing in the digital currency in 2020, and through the end of July, it amassed 226,500 Bitcoin. The firm describes itself as the \"largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world.\"\n\nAs the value of the cryptocurrency has risen over the past year, so has MicroStrategy stock. In fact, the company's share price follows Bitcoin pretty closely.\n\nMSTR Chart\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nIn short, the appreciation in the company's Bitcoin holdings, rather than the business intelligence (BI) software platform that launched the firm in 1989, accounted for its share-price growth.\n\nMicroStrategy's software business\n\nSpeaking of its core BI business, what is MicroStrategy doing with it these days? It's integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its software platform and transitioning to a subscription-based cloud computing model.\n\nPreviously, the company relied on selling software licenses, but the subscription approach provides predictable recurring revenue, and it's seeing strong customer adoption. For instance, its Q2 subscription income was $24.1 million, a 21% increase over the prior year's $19.9 million.\n\nWhile the subscription growth is encouraging, CEO Phong Le noted MicroStrategy's transition to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model \"may result in a decrease in total recognized revenue in the short term, but in the long run, we expect it to be more than offset by increases in subscription services revenue.\"\n\nThat's because software license sales recognize the full income upfront, but with a SaaS model, revenue is recognized over the life of the subscription term. This explains MicroStrategy's trend of declining revenue. The company expects this transition period to last 12 to 18 months, after which year-over-year revenue growth will start.\n\nThe pros and cons of investing\n\nSo far, MicroStrategy's unconventional approach of purchasing Bitcoin has paid off for investors. Between the time when it began buying Bitcoin in 2020 to the end of July, the company's stock price has risen 1,200%. That's far superior to the 64% growth of the S&P 500 index over that time, and even better than Nvidia stock's 948% increase.\n\nThe management team believes it can put cash on the balance sheet to better use by investing in digital capital, specifically Bitcoin. The idea has merit, and as long as the cryptocurrency increases in value over time, this strategy benefits the company.\n\nBut it's not without risk. MicroStrategy's fortunes are now coupled with Bitcoin. This means that what affects the digital currency will have a ripple effect on the firm's stock. For example, regulatory changes involving Bitcoin could have a substantial impact on MicroStrategy.\n\nAnother consideration is how the company is pursuing its Bitcoin strategy. It's funding Bitcoin purchases from the cash generated by its software business, taking on debt, and issuing stock. Over the long term, MicroStrategy's goal is to accumulate Bitcoin faster than it issues shares to generate value for shareholders.\n\nHowever, its cryptocurrency strategy led to the firm accruing a lot of debt on its balance sheet. At the end of Q2, MicroStrategy's total liabilities were $4.2 billion, $3.8 billion of that in debt. Meanwhile, total assets were $7.1 billion, including $5.7 billion in digital assets, namely Bitcoin, and $66.9 million in cash and equivalents.\n\nThis brought MicroStrategy's Q2 debt ratio to 0.55, or 55%. That's an increase from 2023's 0.46, when debt was $2.2 billion and total assets were $4.8 billion.\n\nIn addition, there's the matter of MicroStrategy's core software business. If it fails to grow this business, the company could end up struggling to pay its debt, let alone fund more Bitcoin purchases.\n\nSo for now, buying MicroStrategy stock is only for investors with a high risk tolerance. It's best to reconsider the company after its software business shows year-over-year revenue growth and its balance sheet strengthens.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MicroStrategy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "article_content": "I probably shouldn\u2019t have done it, but ahead of saying goodbye to my original Apple Watch Ultra, I put it back on to test out watchOS 11.\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t I have reacquainted myself with Apple\u2019s chunkiest smartwatch? Despite initially not being that bothered about moving on, I\u2019m now having second thoughts about it.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhy I\u2019m getting rid of my Ultra\n\nThe reason I\u2019m saying goodbye to the Apple Watch Ultra is very simple. It\u2019s being traded in against the new Apple Watch Series 10 in titanium. This is a very expensive smartwatch, and using an old Apple Watch to reduce the price helps soften the blow. I haven\u2019t bought a regular Apple Watch since the Apple Watch Series 7, and its trade-in value is tiny compared to the Apple Watch Ultra\u2019s value. So, that\u2019s the one I chose to send Apple\u2019s way in exchange for 280 British pounds, which is around a $370 price reduction.\n\nAt the time, I was totally enamored with the new Series 10 and very keen to see if the titanium version would feel special enough to be considered a luxury smartwatch. As I hadn\u2019t worn the Apple Watch Ultra for a while, I didn\u2019t spend long considering the deal. Then, as the Series 10\u2019s launch day approached, I retrieved the Watch Ultra to unpair it and prepare to send it away, but then Apple released watchOS 11.\n\nSeeing as I was getting the Apple Watch Ultra out anyway, and that this would be the last time I\u2019d likely spend any time with one, I installed watchOS 11 to give it a try. That was a couple of days ago, and rather than feel nothing for the Watch Ultra, I\u2019ve remembered why I fell for it in the first place. Plus, running watchOS 11 has shown me it\u2019s still a top performer today, and that anyone considering upgrading should think about their decision very seriously.\n\nWearing it again\n\nThe last time I spent time with the Apple Watch Ultra, I did so with it attached to a Solo Loop band, which minimized the size and weight so I could wear it for longer. This time I reverted back to the original Ocean Band. The same little problems are still there, as it\u2019s unforgiving on your wrist and can get quite hot, but it also still looks excellent and with a quick rinse under a running tap to get rid of some accumulated dust, it looks as good as new.\n\nTogether with the Apple Watch Ultra\u2019s case, the combination makes it a large and fairly heavy pairing, but depending on what you\u2019re used to, it likely won\u2019t take much adjustment before you forget all about it. During a recent trip to Berlin, I chose to wear a Casio G-Shock MTG-B1000XB watch (a bit like this one, but in blue and carbon) that weighs around 120 grams and has a 55mm case. The 95-gram, 49mm Apple Watch Ultra feels almost dainty after that. It\u2019s also a testament to Apple\u2019s excellent design, as the curvy case and smoothed-out button and crown guard means it never digs into your wrist.\n\nThe numbers have never been truly representative of how the Apple Watch Ultra feels to wear anyway. It\u2019s smaller and lighter than you expect, even if you\u2019re used to a regular Apple Watch. This hasn\u2019t changed over time either, as even though I\u2019ve been wearing an Apple Watch Series 9 regularly over the past year, putting the Ultra back on hasn\u2019t left me wanting to change back. I also still love the design with its chunky profile, flat screen, and rough-and-tumble button guard. It\u2019s purposeful without going over the top, yet still unique enough to make a statement.\n\nHas watchOS 11 ruined it?\n\nThe good news is that watchOS 11 has done nothing but keep the Apple Watch Ultra ticking along, but the lack of a couple of features has made me feel a little better about my decision to trade the smartwatch in. The Watch Ultra is smooth and fast with the latest software installed, and while it doesn\u2019t change things much, it\u2019s good to see the Translate app is present and working and the Vitals app installed, too. Outside of Vitals, though, there\u2019s not much in watchOS 11 that I\u2019ll use on a day-to-day basis.\n\nCertainly, if you own an Apple Watch Ultra, there\u2019s no reason not to install watchOS 11. Still, it exposes a couple of unfortunate feature omissions on the Watch Ultra, which may prompt you to consider upgrading to the Watch Ultra 2 or the Apple Watch Series 10 this year. The original Watch Ultra does not support Double Tap, the gesture control introduced with the Series 9, and although it hasn\u2019t seen the upgrades I hoped it would this year, it\u2019s still fun and helpful.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra also does not support Apple\u2019s new Sleep Apnea monitoring feature. Although I do not suffer from the condition, it is worth monitoring over time as it is hard to identify. If you\u2019re at all curious about it, then you may decide now is the time to upgrade your Apple Watch Ultra to the Ultra 2 or a Series 10. You will miss out on these two features if you stick with the original Watch Ultra.\n\nSecond thoughts\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra isn\u2019t the latest and greatest Apple Watch, but it runs the latest software, looks brilliant (and exactly the same as the Watch Ultra 2), wears smaller than its dimensions suggest, has the right adventure watch credentials, and is genuinely tough enough to survive some pretty intensive punishment. Pairing it with my iPhone 15 Pro Max reminded me how quick and easy the setup process is, it has delivered all my notifications reliably, there are many native apps available, and I love that I can control my music from it too. I\u2019m also not the only one to feel this way about it.\n\nDouble Tap wasn\u2019t a reason to buy the Series 9 and isn\u2019t a reason to get the Ultra 2 or Series 10, either. Not everyone will be concerned about sleep apnea monitoring or may already have it on another wearable like the Oura Ring. If that\u2019s you, and you have the Watch Ultra on your wrist right now, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth upgrading it at all this year. I\u2019m trading mine in as part of my job (at least, I\u2019m telling myself that), but if I didn\u2019t want to experience the titanium Series 10, then after wearing Ultra again for a few days, I think it would be staying where it is.\n\nWhat\u2019s very interesting to me is one of the reasons I\u2019m going to try the titanium Series 10 is to see if it can truly feel special. To do this, I\u2019ll have to want to wear it often as part of what makes a watch special to me is when I build memories with it. The Apple Watch Ultra\u2019s ability and action-adventure credentials mean it\u2019s highly likely that some wearers will do exactly this. It gives me considerable hope for the titanium Series 10 and serves as a reminder that, unlike so many smartwatches, the Apple Watch Ultra does have its own personality. I\u2019ll package the Watch Ultra to send away soon, but I will be sad about it. In the meantime, I\u2019m going to enjoy it for a little while longer."
