        "article_content": "Netflix\u2019s \u2018Unsolved Mysteries: The Roswell UFO Incident\u2019 sheds light on the controversial Roswell UFO crash incident of 1947. On one hand, the government allegedly covered up the truth by claiming that it was an experimental balloon aircraft that crashed. On the other hand, UFO enthusiasts believed that in addition to the crashing of an actual UFO, bodies of aliens were also recovered. The episode consists of in-depth interviews with some of the experts in the field, including Donald Schmitt, who shared his opinion on the subject.\n\nDonald Schmitt Has Achieved Many Things in the Field of UFOs\n\nDonald Raymond Schmitt\u2019s journey to success was not short or easy. After graduating from Hartford Union High School, he earned his Bachelor\u2019s degree from Concordia University Wisconsin. He also attended Milwaukee Area Technical College for higher studies. Given his interest in UFOs and related subjects, he organized five archaeological dig projects at the 1947 Rowell crash site, with the first one in 1989. The next two digs came after more than a decade, in 2002, followed by 2006. The previous two digs were conducted in 2013 and 2016. His efforts were so impressive that the central theme of \u2018The Roswell Crash: Startling New Evidence\u2019 was based on the second dig.\n\nIn the 1970s, Donald used to work as a special investigator for the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the art director for the International UFO Reporter and the scientific consultant to the Air Force Project Blue Book. So, when the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies in Chicago was founded, he became the Director of Special Investigations and retired from the post after serving for a decade. Apart from being a member of Holy Hill Basilica Choir, he was also the president of Hartford Community Chorus at some point. Donald was also employed at Bloom and Associates as an art director/consultant and at Stellar Productions. Formerly, he was also the Wisconsin State Director of MUFON.\n\nInterestingly, he also co-produced the 2020 documentary titled \u2018The Phenomenon,\u2019 which is centered on the unidentified aerial phenomenon. Starting in 2019, he is a co-founder of the International Coalition on Extraterrestrial Research (ICER), where he serves as the North American Representative. Furthermore, he is currently the co-founder of the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico. There, he is appointed as a board advisor and a lead investigator.\n\nDonald Schmitt Has Written Numerous Best-Selling Books\n\nDonald R. Schmitt has also dabbled in the field of writing and has authored several books. The former special investigator published his debut book, \u2018UFO Crash at Roswell\u2019 in 1991, sharing the title of co-author with Kevin D. Randle. Chronicling the 1947 Roswell UFO incident, the book garnered several eyeballs and ended up getting adapted into a movie for the screen by Arthur L. Kopit and Jeremy Kagan for the latter\u2019s movie, \u2018Roswell.\u2019 Starring Kyle MacLachlan and Martin Sheen in pivotal roles, the 1994 film also earned a nomination for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television at the Golden Globes in 1995. Interestingly, the Golden Globe nod is what Donald considers his most remarkable accomplishment in life.\n\nOver the years, he has made great strides in the world of writing by not only penning his observations in articles but also full-fledged books. Another of his books, \u2018Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the 60-Year Cover-Up,\u2019 which he co-authored with Thomas J. Carey, sat on the throne of the top-selling UFO-themed book across the globe for two years \u2014 2007 and 2008. According to reports, Stellar Productions has optioned the book for the movie, \u2018Majic Men.\u2019 Donald has earned the title of best-selling author not once nor twice but seven times (author/co-author) for many of his titles, such as \u2018The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell,\u2019 \u2018Roswell: The Chronological Pictorial,\u2019 \u2018The Children of Roswell,\u2019 and \u2018Inside the Real Area 51.\u2019 Not just that, Donald has also graced the television screens to share his insight on all things UFO by featuring on \u2018Oprah,\u2019 \u2018CBS 48 Hours,\u2019 \u2018Larry King Live,\u2019 and many more.\n\nDonald Schmitt And His Wife Lead a Private Yet Fulfilling Married Life\n\nThough the professional life of Donald R Schmitt is in the public eye, the personal aspects are something he prefers to keep private. He has been blessed with the companionship of his lovely wife of many years, Marie, and together they have weaved a beautiful life with love, compassion, and understanding. The investigative author has never hesitated to profess his affection and gratitude for his wife for all the support and faith she has shown for and in him since they tied the knot.\n\nIn fact, a testament to that would be the heartwarming shout-out he gave the love of his life in the Acknowledgement section of his 2017 book, titled \u2018Cover-Up at Roswell: Exposing the 70-Year Conspiracy to Suppress the Truth.\u2019 It read: \u201cAnd finally, I will shout it from the highest roof that I am truly blessed with a wife who loves me for being me.\u201d Apart from the fact that his father passed on before his mother, Viola, not much is known about his familial life. As of writing, Donald and his wife seemingly reside in their peaceful ranch in the small community of Hubertus in Washington County, Wisconsin.\n\nRead More: Kevin Randle: Where is the Ufologist Now?"

        "article_content": "Google promised its Gemini AI wouldn\u2019t be a mere chatbot replacement for Google Assistant. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll see if that pledge holds up. Gemini extensions will allow the AI to access users more Google apps rather than just Gmail or YouTube. If it works as intended, it could be the first true cross-phone AI integration.\n\nIn a blog post, Google offered a rough time frame for when we\u2019ll be able to integrate Gemini with different Workspace apps like Google Keep, Google Calendar, Tasks, and Utilities. Currently, Gemini can work with Gmail, Maps, and YouTube. The general concept is that, at users\u2019 request, the AI will be able to pull information from one app to the other without users needing to scroll to find the information they\u2019re looking for.\n\nAs an example, the Mountain View tech giant said users should be able to pull a recipe from Gmail and then add the ingredients into a note in Keep. It will also work with your phone\u2019s camera, and if users take a photo of a receipt or concert ticket, you should be able to set it as an event or reminder in Calendar.\n\nThese features should be dropping in the next few weeks, so we shouldn\u2019t have to wait too long before we try Google\u2019s Geminification of our phones for ourselves. The Gemini app has already taken over most of Assistant\u2019s former duties, and earlier this week, Google gave every Android phone access to Gemini Live. This feature lets you have a conversation with your phone in a more natural way than the base Gemini, which still works better with short and sweet commands.\n\nGoogle showcased some of these features at its big August showcase, revealing the new Pixel 9 series alongside new watches and Pixel Buds. Apple has promised very similar capabilities with its still-incoming Apple Intelligence. So far, we haven\u2019t had the chance to test either company\u2019s full mobile AI integrations. The idea seems sound, but knowing how finicky and inconsistent AI can be, we\u2019re not exactly holding our breath for a real mobile ecosystem sea change.\n\nI may have far less use for a conversational AI than I would for an assistant who can uproot the important emails from my flooded inbox. On Wednesday, Google said it was updating Gmail\u2019s \u201csummary cards\u201d and \u201cHappening soon\u201d features. Happening soon should show the most timely updates, such as deliveries or events happening, based on your emails.\n\nSummary cards now show more information right at the top of each email for purchases, events, bills, and travel registrations. You can add events to your calendar, just like before. But now you can also modify your bookings or get directions to an airport or venue.\n\nGoogle said Gemini was getting access to more than 40 languages other than English, eventually. First on the list are French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, and Hindi. The rest will come sometime in the future. Each phone\u2019s Gemini Live can support conversations with up to two languages at a time. Now even more people will be able to see their Android phone transform into an AI device. The cross-platform mobile AI does feel enticing, especially for those of us with too many things going on to remember where the hell you put that one email with the event registration. However, for those who prefer their phones to be AI-free and still get new features, you may need to bite the Gemini bullet."

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nAI governance company Credo AI launched a new platform that integrates with third-party AI Ops and business tools to gain better visibility around responsible AI policies.\n\nCredo AI\u2019s Integrations Hub, now generally available, lets enterprise clients connect platforms where they build generative AI applications like Amazon Sagemaker, MLFlow and Microsoft Dynamics 365 to a centralized governance platform. Platforms where these applications are often deployed, like to Asana, ServiceNow or Jira can also be added to Integrations Hub.\n\nThe idea is that enterprises working on AI applications can use Integrations Hub to connect to a central governance platform like Credo AI\u2019s governance platform. Instead of needing to upload documentation proving safety and security standards, the Integrations Hub will collect metadata from the applications that contain those metrics.\n\nCredo AI said Integrations Hub will directly connect with existing model stores, which are then automatically uploaded to the governance platform for compliance checks. The hub will also bring in datasets for governance purposes.\n\nNavrina Singh, founder and CEO of Credo AI, told VentureBeat that the integrations hub was designed to make AI governance, whether following data disclosure rules or internal policies around AI usage, become part of the development process at the very beginning.\n\n\u201cAll the organizations that we work with, primarily Global 2000 [companies], are adopting AI at a very fast pace and are bringing in new breeds of AI tools,\u201d Singh said. \u201cWhen we looked across all the enterprises, one of the key things we wanted to enable for them was to extract the maximum value of their AI bets and make governance really easy, so they stop making excuses that it\u2019s difficult to do.\u201d\n\nCredo AI\u2019s Integrations Hub will include ready connections with Jira, ServiceNow, Amazon\u2019s SageMaker and Bedrock, Salesforce, MLFlow, Asana, Databricks, Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Azure Machine Learning, Weights & Biases, Hugging Face and Collibra. Any additional integrations can be customized for an additional fee.\n\nGovernance at the onset\n\nSurveys have shown that responsible AI and AI governance, which normally looks at how applications meet any regulations, ethical considerations and privacy checkups, have become top of mind for many companies. However, these same surveys point out that there are few companies that assessed these risks.\n\nAs enterprises grapple with how to be more responsible around generative AI, providing ways for organizations to easily figure out risks and compliance issues has become a new niche for many companies. Credo AI is just one of the companies offering different avenues to make responsible AI easily accessible.\n\nIBM\u2019s Watsonx suite of products includes a governance platform that lets users evaluate models for accuracy, bias and compliance. Collibra also released a suite of AI tools around governance that creates workflows to document and monitor AI programs.\n\nCredo AI does check applications for potential brand risks like accuracy. Still, it positions its platforms more as a means to meet current laws around automated platforms and any potential new regulation that would come out.\n\nThere are still very few regulations around generative AI, though there have always been policies governing data privacy and data retention that some enterprises would have already been following thanks to machine learning or data rules.\n\nSingh said there are some geographies that do ask enterprises for reports around AI governance. She pointed to New York City Law 144, legislation prohibiting automated tools for employment decisions.\n\n\u201cThere are certain technical evidence you have to collect, like a metric called demographic parity ratio. Credo AI takes this New York City law and codifies it to check your AI Ops system, and since it\u2019s connected to your policies and to where you built your HR system, we can collect that metadata to meet the requirements of the law,\u201d Singh said."

        "article_content": "Netflix\u2019s \u2018Unsolved Mysteries: My Paranormal Partner\u2019 focuses on Don Philips\u2018 alleged ability to interact with a spirit entity called Becky. In order to put his abilities to the test, Paranormal Specialist Steve Mera joined Don on numerous of his paranormal projects and claimed that he witnessed his conversations with the spirit on the recording device. Despite Don being the focal point of the majority of the episode, Steve still manages to invoke several questions in the minds of the viewers.\n\nSteve Mera Has Accomplished a Lot in the Field of UFOs and Paranormal\n\nThe subject of UFOs and the Paranormal has fascinated Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Mera from his early childhood, so much so that he ended up making a career out of it. However, before he made a name for himself in the community, he earned a degree in Electrical Engineering from North Trafford College and GEC Electrical after passing out from Wellington Boys Secondary School. Meanwhile, he ensured that he gave some time to his passion and carried out consistent research on UFOs and the Paranormal, which would prove to be vital in his future. By 1989, his efforts got him a job at NATO as a Telecommunications Officer before working at MAPIT (Manchester Aerial Phenomena Investigation Team) and BUFORA (British UFO Research Association).\n\nA few years later, Steve created the BITC (British Investigators Training Course) in Anomalous Phenomena, which turned out to be a huge success across the United Kingdom. The 1990s were quite productive in his professional career as he reformed MAPIT and helped in the launch of MARA (Merseyside Anomalies Research Association) and NUFORA (The National UFO Research Association). Around 1996, he also launched the SEP (Scientific Establishment of Parapsychology) and worked in the para-psychological departments. By 1998, he had completed the Pre-Degree Psychology at South Trafford College, Manchester, and the BSY Parapsychology Course. He has also worked with Parkway Green Housing Association and Zohar Entertainment Group as a UAP Geological Research and Paranormal Specialist.\n\nIn 2017, he also co-founded ONSTELLAR. Steve also earned his degree in Human Behavioral Psychology from The Manchester Metropolitan University. Steve has also been a part of more than 90 TV shows and radio stations throughout his career, thanks to his expertise in the field of UFOs and the Paranormal. Not only that, he has worked with more than 300 different publications across the world and written for numerous TV shows. Some of the shows he has worked on are \u2018Conspiracy Corner,\u2019 \u2018The X-Files,\u2019 \u2018The Late Night Debate Show,\u2019 \u2018The Scream Team,\u2019 \u2018The Great Unexplained Debate Show,\u2019 \u2018UFO Hunters,\u2019 The Afterlife,\u2019 and more. As for the magazines that have featured his articles, some of them are \u2018UFO Review,\u2019 \u2018UFO News UK,\u2019 \u2018Ghost Voices,\u2019 \u2018Naro Minded,\u2019 \u2018Fate,\u2019 \u2018UFO Magazine,\u2019 \u2018Alien Encounters,\u2019 \u2018Sightings,\u2019 and many more.\n\nWhile he is currently handling his responsibilities as the owner and editor of Phenomena Magazine, Steve also stays busy with running MAPIT and SEP. Having written three books \u2014 \u2018The A-Z of the Unknown,\u2019 \u2018Strange Happenings: Memoirs of a Paranormal Investigator,\u2019 and \u2018Paranormal Insight: A Concise Study of the Strange and Profound\u2019 \u2014 the Paranormal Specialist is also reportedly working on a couple of new books, which would revolve around the UFO Phenomena. On September 30, 2024, he conducted a Birmingham UFO Group meeting at the Hot Shots Snooker Club function room at 100 Crosswells Road in Oldbury, Birmingham. In the same month, Steve also featured as a guest in a podcast called \u2018Paranormal Pendle.\u2019\n\nSteve Mera is Also a Dedicated Partner and Friend\n\nOriginally from Wythenshawe in south Manchester, England, Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Mera leads a content life on the personal front. After all, he has been navigating life\u2019s ups and downs with his one true love, Jackie Heighway, for over a decade now. Though neither of the two has shared when they fell in love, we know that their paths crossed in 2011 in Bolton, and it was in the same year, on November 28, that they turned their fondness for each other into a full-fledged relationship. Together, the two have seemingly built a beautiful world of their own in Greater Manchester, UK, with trust, care, understanding, and loads of love. Jackie is a Salford native who has been self-employed since 2018. Steve has her biggest cheerleader in Jackie, who makes sure she has his back every step of the way.\n\nWhether it is accompanying Steve on his research trips or sharing details about his talks, Jackie does everything to showcase her support for her partner. From what we can tell, Steve seemingly has a daughter named Jenny from a previous relationship. However, not much is known about her. For the uninitiated, Steve is also a huge animal lover and got his first pet in 1997. Losing a pet leaves a huge void in the lives of pet parents and sadly, Steve and Jackie had to experience that pain and grief when their beloved cat, Lucy, crossed over the rainbow bridge in August 2024. \u201cWe will never forget you. You were a huge part of our family. We will meet again one day,\u201d wrote Jackie announcing Lucy\u2019s departure from this world. Though they\u2019ll always miss Lucy, Steve and Jackie are grateful they got to create so many beautiful memories with her.\n\nWhen Steve is not investing his time in furthering his passion, the paranormal specialist enjoys spending time with his family and friends. Even today, he continues to impart all the knowledge he has gathered from his decades of extensive research with the world by setting up meetings and talks every now and then. He also keeps his admirers updated and captivated by sharing his insights on a regular basis on his YouTube channel. Apart from spending time with the love of his life, Jackie, and embarking on trips with her, Steve also looks forward to hanging out with his friends.\n\nRead More: Don Philips: Where is the Paranormal Researcher Now?"

        "article_content": "\u00d7\n\nMilford to hold talks, signings in Durango and Farmington\n\nRetired Navajo Ranger Stanley Milford Jr. has seen some things in his life that can\u2019t always be explained.\n\n\u00d7\n\nMilford, who split his time growing up between his mother\u2019s house in Oklahoma and with his father on the Navajo Reservation, said not only was his upbringing between two different geographic areas, the two were culturally different as well: Oklahoma was more \u201cmainstream and Western\u201d while the reservation was steeped in \u201cNative American culture.\u201d\n\nWhen he grew up, he graduated from the United States Indian Police Academy and became a Navajo Ranger, where he and his partner, Jonathan Dover, investigated paranormal cases called in by residents. For those who have been in the area a while, he also cut his teeth in law enforcement by helping during the 1998 Four Corners manhunt for the three men \u2013 Jason McVean, Robert Mason and Alan \u201cMonte\u201d Pilon \u2013 who killed Cortez Police Officer Dale Claxton and took off into the Colorado/Utah desert.\n\nHe\u2019s just released his memoir, \u201cThe Paranormal Ranger,\u201d and will be at Maria\u2019s Bookshop and in Farmington to discuss it. He\u2019s also been featured on shows, including Nexflix\u2019s reboot of \u201cUnsolved Mysteries.\u201d\n\nIf you go WHAT: Author Event and Book-Signing With Stanley Milford Jr. and his new release, \u201cThe Paranormal Ranger.\u201d WHEN: 6-8 p.m. Oct. 10. WHERE: Maria\u2019s Bookshop, 960 Main Ave. MORE INFORMATION: Visit https://tinyurl.com/y67bn8sx.\n\nThe memoir is a mix of Milford\u2019s autobiography interspersed with chapters about the Navajo origin story.\n\nMilford and Dover first got into paranormal investigations when they were called to take over the case of a Navajo grandmother, who lost a sheep.\n\n\u201cShe recounted this story of this Bigfoot stepping over into her sheep corral and taking off with one of her sheep,\u201d he said. \u201cShe called the department, and two Rangers were assigned, and one of the Rangers was a comedian; he\u2019s just constantly joking and laughing and carrying on. It\u2019s just his personality, but I think the grandmother was probably offended by that, and she contacted the chief ranger and probably chewed him out.\u201d\n\nBecause of her call, the chief called a department meeting, and told everyone that no matter how strange a case may seem, it\u2019s real to the person making the call, and every case was to be investigated as such, even if responding officers didn\u2019t believe it. And then, Milford said, the chief looked over at him and Dover and said they were going to oversee these cases and manage them.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s how it happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as us being assigned to it, we weren\u2019t sitting over there raising our hands to be the Navajo \u2018X Files\u2019 or whatever. That wasn\u2019t the case. We were assigned to do it, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nMilford said the idea to include the origin story into his memoir was inspired by a case in 2009 of a haunting he investigated in Window Rock, Arizona.\n\n\u201cIt was an office space, and the director had said \u2018my staff are experiencing all kinds of what they\u2019re describing as paranormal phenomena.\u2019 She approached the chief ranger at the time and asked if he had anybody that could come in and validate any of the stuff that they were claiming,\u201d he said. \u201cI put together a team of four individuals. We went in on two nights, and one of the prominent things about that case was coins would materialize and fall out of nothingness, out of thin air.\u201d\n\nAnd even after all this time, he said the coins appearing followed him: \u201cLast month, I had the most coins that I\u2019ve ever experienced ... this phenomenon still happens to me to this very day. Witnessing that with your own eyes, it really changes your worldview.\n\n\u201cIt made me realize that, like with the Navajo, in their creation story, they talk about this idea of coming through these different worlds into the physical world that we\u2019re in right now. Some of them describe either four worlds or five worlds, depending on the version of it. It got me thinking that, like with these coins, these coins are manifesting in our physical world from somewhere else. It got me to thinking about string theory and the idea of other planes of existence or dimensions.\u201d\n\nMilford said he starting thinking even further about different paranormal phenomenon that people refer to, \u201clike Bigfoot and UFOs and extraterrestrials, even the witchcraft, even the skinwalkers and things like that. I think they use the these other dimensions coming and going into our physical world from these other dimensions. That\u2019s how we experience it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn and I lived in the woods at times, being Navajo Rangers right in the heavily forested high mountain areas, and we did not find the evidence that supports these things live out there,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou can find all of that with bears, mountain lions, cougars, coyotes and everything that lives out there. You can see where it beds down. You can see where it goes out and hunts and drinks. You can find all of that evidence of that ... but the thing with the Bigfoot, you don\u2019t see all of that evidence, although twice I\u2019ve witnessed this thing that people refer to as Bigfoot. And so I know that these things do happen, and they do exist. So it could interdimensional.\u201d\n\nAnd while he\u2019s had his share of people who don\u2019t believe in what he\u2019s seen and believes, Milford said the key is to be open-minded.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always going to have people that are going to take the opposite 180 view from what you\u2019re talking about, and I understand that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the message that John and I are conveying out there is much more important than listening to those people that are going to put it down. And John and I are open minded; we were very open minded. I remember one time we presented in Dulce, New Mexico, at one other UFO thing. There was an elderly Native woman that came up to us. She was in her mid 80s, and she came up to us with tears in her eyes and hugged us after we did our presentation. She said, \u2018Thank you for doing what you do.\u2019 She went on to convey a story about when she was a young girl encountering her UFO and her family members are standing around her with their jaws wide open because she never, ever shared that experience with them. I think, out of fear of being ridiculed or shunned, or whatever it might be, she never shared that experience. She thanked us and she said, you\u2019re giving people that have these experiences more or less a forum to be able to come together and share these experiences with like-minded people that are willing to listen.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s really, ultimately what the book is: to let people know that these experiences do happen, and to be respectful of others that do have these experiences, and letting people know these people aren\u2019t crazy, and they\u2019re not alone. And I would dare to say worldwide, if you looked at every family on this planet, if you looked in the history of their family, there\u2019s probably somebody within that family that has had some type of so-called supernatural or paranormal experience, whether it\u2019s seeing UFOs and lights in the sky or hauntings. I think it\u2019s much more common than we could ever imagine.\u201d\n\nkatie@durangoherald.com"

The marine robotics company\u2019s trio of orange, 20-foot-long underwater robots found the historic vessel while mapping what is now the 1,286-square-mile Cordell Bank national marine sanctuary off the California coast. Also known as the \u201cGhost Ship of the Pacific,\u201d the 314-foot-long ship has spent the past 78 years resting roughly 3,500 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface, and appears to remain almost completely intact and upright.\n\nThe USS Stewart shipwreck as seen in a 3D map of the region. Credit: Ocean Infinity\n\n\u201cThis level of preservation is exceptional for a vessel of its age and makes it potentially one of the best-preserved examples of a US Navy \u2018four-piper\u2019 destroyer known to exist,\u201d Maria Brown, superintendent for both Cordell Bank and Greater Farallones national marine sanctuaries, said in a statement to The New York Times on October 1.\n\nThe USS Stewart\u2019s story is unique in US maritime history, making it one of the most sought-after wrecks for decades. Initially sunk and abandoned after sustaining substantial battle damage, Japanese forces managed to raise the destroyer, repair it, and reenlist it against America as a naval convoy escort. During its second life, Allied pilots began recounting what appeared to be one of their own ships far within enemy territory, earning the Stewart its \u201cGhost Ship\u201d moniker.\n\nThe shipwreck now serves as a home to deep sea ocean life like crabs and fish. Credit: Ocean Infinity\n\nThe US Navy recovered the Stewart following Japan\u2019s surrender and intended to tow it back to its original home. While en route, however, its engines gave out near Guam, forcing the fleet to tow it the rest of its journey. Once back in the US, the \u201cGhost Ship of the Pacific\u201d was given a dramatic burial at sea on May 24, 1946: Used as target practice for naval forces, it still took an estimated 2 hours of fire to finally sink it for good. But in the years since, the exact coordinates of its location were lost.\n\nThe USS Stewart, seen sinking during its final scuttling by the US Navy. Credit: US Navy / Ocean Infinity\n\nNumerous attempts were made in the past to find the USS Stewart, but the successful August search reportedly came about almost by accident. Ocean Infinity, which previously used its drones to help rediscover the USS Nevada and Endurance wrecks, originally wanted to simply test out multiple of its largest autonomous underwater robots simultaneously. That\u2019s when Russ Matthews, president of the Air/Sea Heritage Foundation nonprofit, suggested the drones be used to scan for the Ghost Ship after he found coordinates of the tugboat that pulled it out to the area of its final scuttling. While it usually takes weeks to map out 37-square-nautical-miles of ocean floor, the drones managed to find the Stewart in a few hours.\n\n[Related: The famous railing from \u2018Titanic\u2019 has broken off from Titanic.]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of, I think, a radical change in ocean discovery,\u201d Jim Delgado, senior vice president of SEARCH, Inc, a maritime archeology firm also involved in the project, told The New York Times on Tuesday.\n\nAside from long-lost shipwrecks, autonomous mapping drones can be used to identify promising ocean floor space for the construction of wind farms, as well as chart routes for underwater cabling."

        "article_content": "ABOVE: Aristolochic acid, a bitter compound produced by Aristolochia flowering plants, is typically rejected by fruit flies. Gut tumor-bearing flies, though, increased their preference towards it, possibly due to its impact on tumors, according to a new study. Chiwei Xu\n\nFor thousands of years, humans likely learned about herbal remedies by observing other animals\u2019 behavior. The Navajo people credit brown bears with leading them to the osha root (Ligusticum porteri), which they use to relieve headaches, treat infections, or chase insects away.1 An Asian legend claims that by watching mongooses chew Rauvolfia serpentina leaves before fighting with cobras, humans discovered its use as a snake-bite antidote.2 While it\u2019s not possible to verify these folk stories, their abundance suggest that animal self-medication has informed human medicinal knowledge.\n\nStudying fruit flies in the lab could also inspire novel cancer drugs, according to a new study in Current Biology.3 A team led by University of California, Santa Barbara neuroscientist Craig Montell found that flies with gut tumors chose to consume a particular bitter compound more often than healthy flies, which normally rejected it. Ingesting this compound had strong, sustained antitumor effects in these flies, hinting at a potential self-medication strategy that could guide drug discovery.\n\nGiven that flies rarely develop cancer due to their short lifespans, the team artificially created three cancer-like models to test whether tumors influenced the flies\u2019 preference for various compounds. Using three different transgenes, they induced the insects\u2019 intestinal stem cells to proliferate and develop tumor-like characteristics. The researchers then allowed tumor-bearing and healthy flies to choose between sucrose alone or a mixture of sucrose and one of four bitter compounds, including caffeine and the botanical compound aristolochic acid (ARI). By measuring how often flies fed on sucrose alone or the bitter meal option, the team determined how strongly they preferred one or the other.\n\nGut tumors did not alter the flies\u2019 rejection of three of these aversive compounds, but they did change their taste preference for ARI. Two of the fly cancer models now showed no preference towards sucrose alone; they fed on both dish choices with the same frequency. The third strain became even more attracted to ARI than to sucrose alone. Notably, when the researchers assessed the impact of ARI on tumors, they found that it suppressed cell proliferation. Even consuming it for two days led to a prolonged suppression of gut tumor growth.\n\nMontell and his colleagues then explored the neural mechanisms behind this shift in taste. The tumor could be altering how the flies\u2019 bitter-sensing gustatory receptor neurons respond to ARI, or the change might occur in the brain after this interaction, or both. To test the first hypothesis, the team conducted electrophysiological experiments on the taste-sensing cells on the flies\u2019 proboscises and legs. They found that these peripheral neurons responded no differently to ARI in gut tumor-bearing flies than in control ones. Thus, the change in taste preference likely occurs in the central nervous system, though the details are still unknown.\n\n\u201c[The findings] suggest there is something about the cancer that\u2019s altering the brain in a way that this compound no longer is aversive,\u201d said Jeremy Borniger, a cancer neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory who did not participate in the present study. \u201cThe next step is\u2026to identify which neurons or which groups of neurons in the brain are regulating this process\u2014how does the tumor alter these cells so that they receive the same signals from the taste of this compound and then interpret it differently?\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, despite its tumor-suppressing effects, ARI is too toxic to the kidneys and liver to be developed into a drug. However, the study\u2019s approach may open promising avenues for discovering medical compounds. For Montell, that is actually the most exciting outcome of this work: It establishes Drosophila as an animal model for self-medication and, therefore as a system to screen thousands of molecules for potential novel drugs against gastrointestinal carcinomas. \u201cThe initial screen would be looking for chemicals for which [gut tumor-bearing flies] have an increased preference. . .and then, of those that you find, which ones actually increase their lifespan,\u201d he explained. While scientists have previously used fruit flies for screening cancer drugs, Montell noted that, \u201cConceptually, this would be different because it would be using self-medication as the primary screen, so people have not done that before.\u201d4"

        "article_content": "The green coding imperative is real and it stems from the ground up (i.e. the command line) and from the cloud down.\n\nAs we continue to pursue initiatives in this space, it\u2019s worth reflecting upon the \u201cshared responsibility\u201d factors that govern the way we approach and consume enterprise technologies at the platform level.\n\nSome of the discussion here gravitates around the shared responsibility that exists between customers who consume public (and indeed private, or hybrid) cloud services at the application deployment end \u2013 who need to think about compute efficiency and where they can refactor (or perhaps retire) some legacy applications and data services \u2013 and the cloud providers who supply the datacentre pipes in the first place.\n\nIt feels like the message has really gotten through at the developer level. Not to suggest that there is any overly-woke level of acceptance here and we clearly do still need to champion these issues, but perhaps it\u2019s time to look a little deeper into the backend.\n\nZoning in on the cloud datacentre side of the argument, a new report has emerged this month from hybrid multi-cloud computing company Nutanix which suggests that billions could be saved if we take a more sustainable approach to datacentre development, operation and management.\n\nImproving sustainability Carried out by digital advisory and analytics company Atlantic Ventures\u2019, the Improving Sustainability in Data Centers 2024 suggests methods and means for next-generation datacentre architectures, including an analysis of how hybrid cloud and hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) can reduce energy consumption, lower carbon emissions and drive cost savings. In what could be \u201cjust\u201d six years, the report finds that modernising datacentres with HCI-based solutions could save up to 19 million tCO2e in the EMEA region, equivalent to the emissions of almost 4.1 million cars. It could also save \u20ac25 billion by 2030 from improved energy and operational efficiencies. NOTE: As per its use above, tCO2e stands for Tonnes of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent, sometimes written as ton, but always relating to a metric tonne i.e. 1000 kilograms.\n\nPost-Covid digitisation Nutanix says that as businesses now work towards the reality of post-Covid digitisation and the demands for data-hungry technologies, such as AI and IoT, this report identifies an increasing urgency for action. The dual challenges of rising energy costs and increased regulatory pressure to reduce their environmental impact are making this more difficult for IT leaders. As a result, energy efficiency has become a top priority for CIOs and data centre managers. \u201cDatacentres are critical to the global digital economy but also rank among the largest consumers of energy,\u201d says Sammy Zoghlami, SVP EMEA at Nutanix. \u201cIn EMEA alone, datacentres demand over 98 TWh of energy annually, equivalent to the consumption of an entire country like Belgium. The findings of this report show that by leveraging HCI-based solutions, companies can make a powerful contribution to climate action while significantly cutting operational costs.\u201d Atlantic Ventures used a study method to analyse a typical Western European enterprise datacentre, comparing traditional 3-Tier infrastructure to HCI-based systems in terms of energy consumption, carbon emissions and operational costs.\n\nUK-specific data In terms of UK-specific data put forward here, Atlantic Ventures says that switching from traditional 3-Tier architectures to an HCI-based platform can reduce energy consumption by more than 27% annually. Across the EMEA region, a full-scale transition could save up to 92 TWh of electricity and eliminate 19 million tons of CO\u2082e between 2024 and 2030, this amount would equate to savings of 13.4 TWh of electricity. NOTE: The European Commission defines Terawatt hours, abbreviated as TWh, is a unit of energy representing one trillion watt hours. \u201cCIOs and digital executives are facing challenges to provide the digital infrastructure to cope with the fast-growing demand for compute power and storage capacity, especially with the emergence of AI applications,\u201d says Dr. Carlo Velten, co-founder of Atlantic Ventures. \u201cAs IT budgets are under pressure and electricity prices are soaring, energy efficient data centre and cloud operations are key levers for profitability and sustainability. Hyperconverged infrastructure is at the forefront of transforming data centres into more energy-efficient and climate-friendly operations, as this report confirms.\u201d Other suggestions made here include the notion that HCI-based architecture also enables lean, energy-efficient disaster recovery systems in the cloud, reducing the infrastructure footprint while maintaining scalability and responsiveness \u201cThe financial windfall from reduced electricity consumption could reach \u20ac25 billion by 2030, offering businesses a rare opportunity to align sustainability with profitability. Due to relatively high price levels for electricity, the potential electricity cost savings for companies and service providers in the UK could be as much as 3,3 billion euros between 2024 \u2013 2030 when switching on-premises from 3-Tier to HCI,\u201d stated Nutanix, in its summary overview of these findings. Migrating HCI platforms to co-location or public cloud environments is argued to magnify these benefits, with potential energy savings reaching as high as 54% compared to traditional on-premise datacentres. This is due to the low PUE of Public Cloud Providers as well as the flexibility in providing on-demand computing capacity."
