This is similar to The Manhattan Project; this is the atomic weapon on steroids,\u201d says Jay Stratton, former director of the U.S. government\u2019s UAP task force.\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure is helmed by filmmaker Dan Farah and will premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival in the Paramount Theatre in March. The film\u2019s producers are currently in talks to get the movie commercial distribution."

Called Perplexity Assistant, the AI helper is available through the Perplexity app on the Google Play Store and is supported in 15 languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Hindi.\n\nWhile we haven\u2019t had a chance to try out the new Perplexity Assistant, the company claims it can perform multi-app actions, similar to Gemini\u2019s recently acquired chaining actions that Google first demonstrated on the Galaxy S25 series.\n\nHere are a few more examples of what Perplexity Assistant can do. We can\u2019t wait to see how you use it. pic.twitter.com/F7ibSFfrgq Get it here: https://t.co/H4J9cr68So \u2014 Perplexity (@perplexity_ai) January 23, 2025\n\nFor example, you can ask the AI to \u201cplay that song at the end of Interstellar.\u201d It will research the song\u2019s name on the web and open a music app on your phone to play it.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure how this would function, but we\u2019re guessing you\u2019ll have to grant Perplexity some permissions to open and execute commands on your apps. Gemini uses extensions to facilitate chaining actions, but Perplexity hasn\u2019t really elaborated on how its AI will facilitate multi-app actions on Android phones.\n\nPerplexity Assistant is also multimodal, which means it can answer questions based on voice commands and understand multiple types of data, such as text, images, audio, and video. \u201cYou can tell it to turn on the camera and ask about what you see in front of you or on your screen,\u201d the company explains.\n\nThe company lists Perplexity Assistant\u2019s other capabilities as follows: \u201cYou can book dinner, find a forgotten song, call a ride, draft emails, set reminders, and more.\u201d\n\nLooks like we\u2019ll have to give Perplexity Assistant a go and see how it compares to Gemini.\n\nYou might like"

            "article_content": "A s a health journalist, I know how difficult it can be to find accurate health information online. In the age of AI-powered search engines, you never quite know if the answers served up to you at the top of the page are from legitimate medical sources or some woo-woo wellness site that hasn't been touched in years. Even in my personal life, it can be tricky to find resources about the conditions I may face as a woman\u2014and I know I'm not alone in that experience.\n\nFrom menstruation to fertility, and yes, even to menopause, there's still so much mystery surrounding women's health. Case in point: More than 1 million Americans go through menopause each year, but studies find that 80 percent of those people have limited knowledge about menopause, never learned about it in school, or have a negative attitude toward the life phase altogether. No wonder so many of us are too embarrassed to bring up our concerns at the OB/GYN, which can lead to gaps in quality care.\n\nThis is where AI\u2014and personalized health advice in the form of an app\u2014can be useful. Meet Roon, an app that partners world-class healthcare providers with artificial intelligence to bridge the divide between people and reliable health information. Recently, Roon launched Roon Menopause\u2014a platform that serves as a digital library for all the menopause questions you may have, from how to tame a hot flash to navigating hormone therapy, with answers from real-life medical experts.\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with Roon CEO and co-founder Vikram Bhaskaran to learn more about the launch. Here's what to expect once you hit download on iOS.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nFirst, what is Roon?\n\nRoon is an app that puts free, expert-driven resources on several health conditions at your fingertips. Conditions featured on the app include ALS, dementia, endometriosis, fertility, glioblastoma, PCOS, and now, menopause. The app was born when Bhaskaran, a former tech developer with Pinterest, became a caregiver for his father with ALS and noticed a disturbing lack of information about the illness online.\n\n\"Like most caregivers on the planet, I spent thousands of hours on Dr. Google, Facebook groups, Instagram, and TikTok to try to find medically vetted information,\" Bhaskaran says. \"When it comes to health, it sometimes feels like we are still in the dark ages.\" But between how long it takes to see a specialist, plus providers only spending about 18 minutes on average with patients per appointment, Bhaskaran says it only makes sense that we turn to the Internet for help.\n\nUsing his tech-savvy and appreciation for beautiful, algorithm-driven apps like Pinterest, Bhaskaran teamed up with his co-founder Rohan Ramakrishna, MD, a neurosurgeon at Weill Cornell, engineers, and designers to develop Roon, which houses hundreds of pre-recorded videos of healthcare providers answering the top questions they get asked every day.\n\nOn top of that, users can also take advantage of the \"ask a question\" search tool to find answers, all with the help of AI technology. (More on this below.)\n\nHow Roon uses AI to provide health information\n\nInstead of gathering answers from all over the Internet like other AI-powered search engines, Roon's \"ask a question\" AI tool only pulls quotes from the pre-recorded content that exists within the app. This ensures you're getting accurate and reliable answers straight from a professional each time you search, and not some unknown source.\n\nOnce your question has been answered, the AI tool auto-populates related questions, which is how the personalization takes shape. \"The more you use it, the more we learn about you so we can ultimately become your personalized guide for health,\" says Bhaskaran. Plus, if you add your age and gender identity, \"we can also personalize content based on where you are in your journey,\" he adds. So, for example, if you're a 40-year-old female who's trying to get pregnant, it might suggest you watch perimenopause or fertility content.\n\nWhile this service doesn't replace the need for real visits with your healthcare provider, it could help those with a lack of access to quality care or insufficient health insurance feel more empowered\u2014and less confused\u2014about their well-being. \"In the age of AI-generated content, we're going the opposite way, which is there's nothing more human than a doctor looking into a camera answering your question when you're going through a hard journey,\" Bhaskaran adds.\n\nOther Roon Menopause features\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about Roon Menopause is its user-friendliness. No matter your level of tech skill, the simple design makes it fairly easy to sift through each tab and section. You can start searching for information based on the type of expert you want to hear from (like a reproductive endocrinologist, OB/GYN, or holistic practitioner), the symptoms you're experiencing (like vaginal dryness, fatigue, or insomnia), co-occurring conditions you may have (like osteoporosis or depression), or other topics, like treatments, diagnosis, causes, and more.\n\nOnce you find a topic you're interested in, you can watch short videos or read written responses from a variety of providers, who Bhaskaran says are not only heavily vetted before joining the app, but are also great communicators with good bedside manner IRL. Some notable names include Mindy Goldman, MD, the chief clinical officer at MIDI Health, Corrine Menn, MD, with Alloy Women's Health, and Rajita Patil, MD, a menopause specialist at UCLA Health, among others.\n\nFrom there, the AI feature will suggest other topics or questions you might ask. Consider it a personal search engine and doctor-filled social feed all in one.\n\nAnd we're not just talking about physical health here: Roon Menopause also spans the mental, emotional, and sexual wellness aspects of menopause. So you may explore topics like \"how to comfortably have sex with vaginal dryness,\" \"how to talk to your partner about menopause,\" or \"how to start your fertility treatment if you're also in perimenopause.\" It also offers tips for optimal nutrition, exercise, holistic vs. traditional medicine practices, and specific treatment options for each menopause symptom you're facing.\n\nHere's more of a breakdown of the features:\n\nExpert network of over 60 licensed healthcare providers\n\nThousands of pre-recorded Q&A videos and written content\n\nApproximately 1,300 answered questions\n\nOver 100 related subtopics\n\nInstant answers through an AI-powered search tool\n\nAdvice from people with lived experience\n\nMultiple expert perspectives on highly debated treatment options (such as hormone therapy)\n\nCulturally sensitive and trauma-informed content\n\nNext-step advice for receiving care\n\nUltimately, Bhaskaran says this service is a safe place to ask the hard questions or ones you may be too uncomfortable to ask your provider about. \"This is just the beginning of how we'll support women across their lifetime health journeys through expert guidance,\" he adds.\n\nYes, it's personal, but is your data safe?\n\nWithin the last few years, some people have shied away from using period tracking apps for fear that their reproductive health information will be shared and sold to third parties or that it would be used against them at healthcare facilities or in legal proceedings. This is because period trackers can not only log menstruation, but also missed periods, miscarriages, and infertility.\n\nBut rest assured that with Roon, the private details you share about your reproductive health stay within the app, and are only used to further optimize your experience, says Bhaskaran. Data is stored locally and never shared with third parties.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThere's nothing more comforting than having a trusted healthcare provider's advice by your side\u2014especially during a time like menopause. Whether you're already in it, about to start, or know a loved one currently going through the life phase, apps like Roon Menopause\u2014which combines AI with medically sound information\u2014can cut through the noise, misinformation, or even medical gaslighting you may face, both online and in person.\n\nAdditional Sources + Well+Good articles reference scientific, reliable, recent, robust studies to back up the information we share.

            "article_content": "Scary Movie 6 is coming in June of 2026 Keenen Ivory, Shawn, and Marlon Wayans are dropping their return to the Scary Movie franchise right in the middle of blockbuster season 2026.\n\nIt\u2019s been 12 years since a Scary Movie movie last showed up in theaters\u2014and 18 since the franchise was in the hands of its original director and co-writers, Keenen Ivory, Shawn, and Marlon Wayans. That first number will rise to an unlucky 13 by the time the franchise\u2019s recently announced sequel comes out, though, as Deadline reports that Scary Movie 6 has been slapped down on the schedule smack dab in the middle of blockbuster country next year: June 12, 2026.\n\nAmong other things, that means the new movie will be trailing just four months behind the latest installment in the series that served as the primary inspiration for the whole franchise, as Scream VII limps its way into theaters in February of 2026, after some fairly serious drama in its production background. (Which brings to mind the irony that Scary Movie, which is really only a Scream parody in its first film, was out-pacing its inspiration in terms of sequels for a good long while there before Radio Silence revived the slasher flicks with Scream in 2022.)\n\nThere are still a ton of question marks surrounding Scary Movie 6, most notably casting: Anna Faris and Regina Hall starred in the first four movies in the franchise, but didn\u2019t come back for 2013\u2019s Scary Movie 5. (Ashley Tisdale, Simon Rex, Erica Ash, and Charlie Sheen, who grappled on to the series like a sort of flailing relevance lifeboat, all starred in that one.) There\u2019s also the simple fact that horror is a very fast moving target to try to hit when you\u2019re doing parody. The Scary Movie films, which ended up in the hands of Airplane!\u2018s David Zucker after the Wayans had a falling out with Miramax after Scary Movie 2, did their best to try to keep up with trends over the years, shifting the focus from slashers to newer horror movie trendsetters like The Ring, Paranormal Activity, and, for some reason, Black Swan. But it\u2019ll be genuinely fascinating to see if the Wayans\u2019 script will be able to keep up with just how hard horror has mutated over the last decade\u2014or if they\u2019ll just do, like, a horny parody of Art The Clown from Terrifier and call it a day. We\u2019ll know for sure when June 2026 rolls around."

But there is no cure for HIV or AIDS or a vaccine for human use to prevent infection.\n\nOne of the labs involved in current research to design such a vaccine is at La Jolla-based Scripps Research, which recently made a discovery that could drive development of the vaccine.\n\nMany vaccines work by introducing a protein to the body that resembles part of a virus. Ideally, the immune system will produce long-lasting antibodies recognizing that virus, thereby providing protection.\n\nBut Scripps Research scientists said they have found that for some HIV vaccines, something else happens. After a few applications, the immune system begins to produce antibodies against immune complexes already bound to the viral protein.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique reaction in which antibodies bind to other antibodies, which is rare,\u201d said Scripps researcher Sharidan Brown, first author of a study published Jan. 17 in Science Immunology. \u201cOver the course of multiple immunizations [in animals], we have found four classes of antibodies that cling to other antibodies. They are unique responses, so by understanding the structure for the first time, we are put on the right foot to understand these better and can harness them for not only HIV vaccine design but other therapeutics.\u201d\n\nThe observation came about when researchers in the lab of Andrew Ward, a professor of integrative structural and computational biology at Scripps Research, was using advanced imaging tools to study how antibodies evolve after multiple HIV vaccine doses. A technique the lab invented, known as Electron Microscopy-Based Polyclonal Epitope Mapping, or EMPEM, let the researchers see exactly where on the virus antibodies bind.\n\nWhen they carried out the experiments on blood from animals that had received multiple doses of an experimental HIV vaccine, they discovered that some of the antibodies were not binding directly to the HIV viral antigen but to immune molecules on its surface.\n\nIt isn\u2019t yet known whether this binding is a good thing in designing an effective vaccine, but Brown said future studies should answer that question.\n\n\u201cIt adds to our understanding of what these vaccines are capable of eliciting,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe don\u2019t fully know what these antibodies do yet, but by understanding and future experiments looking into why they get elicited and what they do, we can adjust vaccine studies to make them more effective by either harnessing or getting rid of it.\n\n\u201cIt could be a good thing [that the antibodies bind together] because it could give the immune system a bigger set of antibodies. Or it could be detrimental in that it is not making antibodies the body needs.\u201d\n\nShe and others in the lab \u201care excited to see where these antibodies fit into the immune response and the body\u2019s ability to fight off HIV,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could lead to redesigning vaccines to target or eliminate these responses and could lead to better vaccines.\u201d\n\nImplementation of any vaccine stemming from this discovery is years away from human trials, but Brown said an effective vaccine would have a great impact.\n\n\u201cThere are still millions of people diagnosed with HIV, so having a vaccine would impact the lives of people around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a vaccine that prevents infection would be instrumental in reducing the spread. Right now, there are no vaccines in use in humans. There are clinical trials in humans, which is exciting, and we have made a lot of progress toward eliciting the types of antibodies with these vaccines in the past five years or so. This [discovery] is an extra data point to think about when we design these vaccines and could help us better design boosting immunizations.\u201d\n\nBrown, a native of Montana, \u201cwhere I fell in love with science,\u201d said she came to Scripps Research for her Ph.D. studies and was placed in her current lab to research immunology and structural biology.\n\n\u201cI feel super lucky to work in the lab I do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have such a diverse, large lab of people full of amazing ideas.\u201d\n\nThe next step for the lab is to look at the antibody responses in other models.\n\n\u201cWe want to understand how they are generated and what they do, and any consequences to these antibodies being around,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThen we can modify these types of responses in vaccine design.\u201d \u2666"

            "article_content": "Save\n\nQ&A: Oncofertility innovator awarded National Medal of Science\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nTeresa K. Woodruff, PhD, was one of 14 recipients of the National Medal of Science in 2025.\n\nShe is credited with creating the field of oncofertility, which focuses on preserving fertility during cancer treatment.\n\nFew researchers can claim to be a pioneer in their field quite like Teresa K. Woodruff, PhD.\n\nWhile serving as the basic science director at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, Woodruff recognized there was little attention being paid to the reproductive future of girls and young women who had cancer.\n\n\u201cIn that role, I learned of a boy with cancer who was being brought down from our pediatric hospital to bank sperm because his mother asked for it,\u201d Woodruff, who currently serves as president emerita of Michigan State University and an MSU Research Foundation Professor in obstetrics, gynecology, reproductive biology and biomedical engineering, told Healio. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard of it, nobody had heard of it, because it just wasn\u2019t done.\n\n\u201cI asked, \u2018What do we do for young women,\u2019\u201d Woodruff said. \u201cI was told they need to focus on their cancer and get better from that disease. It was that thunderbolt moment that I thought my research can have something to do with the options that these cancer patients might have.\u201d\n\nWoodruff came up with the word oncofertility to describe a new medical field dedicated toward preserving fertility for a young person undergoing cancer treatment. Shortly after inventing the term, Woodruff founded the Oncofertility Consortium, which consists of a group of health care professionals and researchers who are focused on exploring and solving the many issues surrounding fertility during cancer treatment.\n\nWoodruff\u2019s work in oncofertility is just one reason she received an illustrious honor in January. Former President Joe Biden named Woodruff as one of 14 recipients of the National Medal of Science, an honor granted to those who make outstanding contributions to science in service of the U.S.\n\nHealio spoke with Woodruff about her career accomplishments, her tenure as president of the Endocrine Society in 2013-2014 and what the National Medal of Science means to her.\n\nHealio: What inspired you to pursue a career in the sciences, medicine and reproductive health?\n\nWoodruff: I was inspired in the sciences by my mother when I was in third grade. She was teaching a summer class in our area on volcano science. It inspired me to want to be a first grade teacher.\n\nI went to college to major in elementary education. There I found the sciences and my love of research. One of my professors asked me if I\u2019d be interested in doing research. He took me to California Institute of Technology in 1984. I really got the bug for science then, and later for reproductive science.\n\nI decided I was going to pursue a PhD when I was doing rotations in laboratories at Northwestern University. There was a professor named Kelly Mayo, PhD, and he was researching molecular endocrinology, the genes that control reproductive cycles. I joined his lab and really haven\u2019t turned back since.\n\nHealio: Why did you decide to create the Oncofertility Consortium?\n\nWoodruff: To get from bench to bedside and to have a profound effect on patients, you have to go around the entire circumference of the problem. A patient isn\u2019t going to be able to access the protocols if an oncologist isn\u2019t talking to an in vitro fertilization doctor, that patient is not going to be able to opt in if there\u2019s no insurance coverage, a doctor\u2019s not going to offer it if there\u2019s no reimbursement and if a parent or a partner can\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening, they\u2019re going to say, \u201cLet\u2019s just focus on cancer.\u201d\n\nWhat the consortium said is that we must have a continuum of care from the bench to bedside to babies. We\u2019ve got to bring in the students, the nurses, patients and we have to bring in oncology. We\u2019ve got to bring in social science, ethics and religion. And we have to work toward insurance and reimbursement availability.\n\nThe consortium was meant to be the hub to bring everybody together around this new idea and new word of oncofertility. It was really a consequence of saying, \u201cWe\u2019re all in this at the beginning.\u201d That is why it worked, because it wasn\u2019t a few people building it. We were all building it.\n\nHealio: Is there any achievement in your career that you are most proud of and why?\n\nWoodruff: The first live birth of mice from the oocyte outside the body was named the Discovery of the Decade [by Nature Medicine]. That discovery was done with Lonnie Shea, PhD, who is at University of Michigan. He was my great collaborator on many of our discoveries.\n\nThat discovery is only closely first to the [discovery of] zinc spark. Zinc spark is this magnificent release of zinc from the oocyte at the time of fertilization. Nobody even knew to look for zinc. We discovered this massive upregulation of zinc, and then the release of it at fertilization. That was done with my collaborator, Tom O\u2019Halloran, PhD. Those were two monumental discoveries in the field of reproductive science.\n\nHealio: What do you like most about being a member of the Endocrine Society? What was your experience like when you served as president at the Endocrine Society?\n\nWoodruff: I gave my first scientific talk at the Endocrine Society meeting in New Orleans in 1988. It\u2019s a place where I have grown up as a scientist and as a scholar. I\u2019ve presented my work and eventually went through a lot of the leadership roles there.\n\nThe organization is one that focuses on the pipeline of development of people. The society develops people to enable them to do their best work in the clinic or at the bench. Many societies say they are just a clinical society or a basic science society. The Endocrine Society is all of us. I think that\u2019s what really makes it a powerful voice for endocrinology in the nation.\n\n[When I was president], there were so many milestones. We bought a building in downtown Washington, D.C. Our CEO, Scott Hunt, decided to retire, so we had to do a CEO search for the first time in 25 years. We were also in the middle of a rebranding of the organization. Those were three of the real highlights that I think have resonated and continued to be impactful over time.\n\nHealio: When did you decide to apply for a position at Michigan State and what attracted you to the university?\n\nWoodruff: Michigan State is a great land grant institution that has this real breadth going from the land, water and animal science all the way to human medicine and to the stars. One of the key discoveries at Michigan State was of cisplatin, the cancer drug that has saved so many lives. Michigan State had always been on my radar for that discovery, because oncofertility was providing the fertility to those people whose lives had been saved by that drug.\n\nHealio: What did receiving the National Medal of Science mean to you?\n\nWoodruff: I was so humbled. It was such a humbling call when I first learned of it. This is an award for the folks in the lab, my collaborators like Lonnie and Tom, for my students, and for the field. I\u2019m so pleased that I had the opportunity to be a small part of what\u2019s become a true field of medicine that is making a difference in patients\u2019 lives all around the globe.\n\nReferences:\n\nClark D.

The startup is partnering with Oracle and SoftBank on the project, which will help operate the facilities and raise more capital, respectively. The group further intends to raise $500 billion over the next four years to open more data centers beyond the first one in Abilene, Texas, on a site the size of New York\u2019s Central Park.\n\nData centers are frequently announced in states across the U.S. to great fanfare as governors and local officials applaud the economic opportunity for their regions. However, data centers typically do not employ very many people once the construction is finished, at least not directly. President Trump announced Stargate alongside the group\u2019s leaders earlier this week, saying it would create \u201cover 100,000 American jobs.\u201d But that number appears nebulous, which is a guess for the indirect number of jobs that will be created in the AI industry thanks to the larger capacity. How that number was determined is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nIn past years, Apple has defended the fees it charges App Store developers, citing the number of people indirectly employed across the U.S. in app development.\n\nBloomberg examined the number of permanent workers employed by other data centers in Texas and found the numbers to be quite small. Microsoft employs just 325 people across all its data centers in Texas, but that number is in the thousands during construction. \u201cWe estimate it will take approximately 11.8 million work hours and more than 2,892 jobs during peak construction to complete the construction of new data centers,\u201d a report reads.\n\nTech companies often tout these numbers to get tax breaks. Abilene has given Stargate an 85% discount on its property taxes for two decades of its operations.\n\nIn addition to concerns about data centers using massive amounts of energy and harming fragile power grids, locals in some communities across the U.S. have complained about the visual blight of massive beige data centers the size of football fields sitting in view of their homes. President Trump says he will expedite the construction of power plants co-located beside data centers, including even ones using coal.\n\nThe tech industry has gotten behind the new Republican White House as it has lifted regulation on AI safety and committed to beating China in the race to dominance, even though massive returns on investment have not yet materialized and Trump pledges to cede America\u2019s chances of beating China in another field, electric cars. Tech leaders have been beating the drum that China\u2019s domination in artificial intelligence threatens U.S. national security. Maybe it\u2019s true, but the likes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also have some self-interest in making these statements."

ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN\n\n\u2018She was trying to hide it\u2019: Online harms lead to some parents wanting social media ban\n\nSINGAPORE - When asset manager Look Ru Shin noticed her daughter, then aged 10, glued to her phone, something felt off.\n\n\u201cShe was trying to hide it,\u201d Madam Look, 46 , recalled.\n\nA closer look revealed that her daughter, Claire, had received inappropriate messages from a stranger on Minecraft. \u201cI immediately deleted her account and the app,\u201d she said.\n\nThe incident heightened Madam Look\u2019s concerns about harms online that she had seen, such as toxic trends, warped beauty standards and sexualised content, and their detrimental impact on children.\n\nMany parents stand with her in wishing to see more handholding when it comes to online usage for children, but are torn on what the most effective measures should be.\n\nRegulators globally are at a crossroads with online platforms and harmful content that plagues social media, games and other apps.\n\nMany nations, including Britain, European countries, Indonesia and Singapore are mulling over age restrictions \u2013 with some even considering outright bans on social media for teenagers.\n\nAustralia has led the charge, passing a ban that will kick in later in 2025, to outlaw social media for teenagers under 16.\n\nSingapore\u2019s Minister of State for Digital Development and Information Rahayu Mahzam said in Parliament in January that Singapore shares the same objectives as Australia in legislating age limits for social media access to protect young users and is in talks with the country over Australia\u2019s approach.\n\nThe Republic\u2019s approach \u2013 for now \u2013 targets app stores and app creators, who are required to follow standards under codes of practice to address harms on their platforms or face penalties like a fine of up to $1 million or be blocked here.\n\nApp stores have until March 2026 to set up technology that can check users\u2019 age \u2013 a key measure in keeping children away from mature apps.\n\nMadam Look Ru Shin caught her daughter, Claire, receiving inappropriate messages on Minecraft when she was aged 10. ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN\n\nAs Singapore evaluates the merits of a social media ban, the views among parents interviewed by The Straits Times are split over whether this will be effective. Some are in favour of a sweeping ban while others want to see brakes applied to online usage but wish to ease their children into the online world.\n\nMs Tammie Wong, 46 , supports the ban, which she likened to having a law against underage drinking to protect teenagers from its harmful effects.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe advent of social media was so quick that its effects on our youth are unprecedented and unchartered. Many effects are surfacing only now.\u201d\n\nMs Wong added: \u201cWithout a concerted and clear signal, the extent to how much parents can control kids\u2019 usage is limited, especially when they reach teenhood.\u201d\n\nDr Natalie Games, a clinical psychologist at Alliance Counselling , said that a ban works like scaffolding for parents, as it would usher in more protective measures around social media and support them in their struggle to manage their children\u2019s use of social media.\n\nMore than half of her clients, especially teenagers, talk about social media in the context of struggles.\n\nBut a ban is just one step as digital literacy is still crucial to helping teenagers navigate the digital world, she said.\n\nOnline content has been blamed for encouraging harmful behaviour and mental health issues among young people.\n\nMany are still reeling from the tragedy of British teenager Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after being exposed to thousands of Instagram and Pinterest posts about depression, self-harm and suicide in the months leading up to her death.\n\nYet, young people today are still frequently exposed to suicide and self-harm content online. TikTok has been criticised for circulating viral challenges encouraging dangerous activities, such as ingesting chemicals or dangerously holding one\u2019s breath.\n\nAnother parent, Madam Salizawati Abdul Aziz, 41 , said she feels a sense of unease as her six children, aged between three and 17 , are increasingly exposed to online services.\n\n\u201cMost alarming for me was that it is so easy to access videos with sexual content, and ones that feature women in a sexualised manner, like in skimpy clothes and doing things to entice viewers,\u201d added Madam Saliza, a teacher.\n\n\u201cI was shocked that I could see these as I casually swiped through the Facebook shorts or IG stories. It got me thinking then how do I filter and prevent my young children from viewing such things,\u201d she said, welcoming the stricter expectations on online services.\n\nShe noticed differences between those who had online devices while growing up and those who did not.\n\nThe older children who grew up largely without social media till their late teens are typically more sociable and focused, said Madam Saliza.\n\nMadam Salizawati Abdul Aziz, 41, says her older children who grew up without social media tend to be more sociable and focused. PHOTO: GAVIN FOO\n\nHer younger children who have been exposed to more screen time at a young age are less focused and tend to get upset when they are told to put down their device.\n\n\u201cI would prefer them to immerse themselves in books and building Lego, like what the previous generations did.\u201d\n\nMadam Saliza added: \u201cIn such a tech-savvy generation, we cannot stop children from being exposed and using social media and apps as it\u2019s already part of our daily lives. But we need to be aware of what our children are viewing and accessing.\u201d\n\nFor her 15-year-old daughter Syaliz , hours feel like seconds when she is using TikTok.\n\nSyaliz said: \u201cI just keep scrolling, and don\u2019t realise that I\u2019ve gone four hours on it.\u201d\n\nThe Secondary 4 student said she encounters content related to mental health and body image on her Instagram feed on a daily basis, which led to her becoming more self-conscious about her own body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll scroll and see many fit and healthy-looking influencers post about how people call them fat. I started to think, \u2018if people consider them fat, then what am I?\u2019\u201d\n\nMr Bradley Joe, a father of three , said that while tech platforms must do better, a ban would be rushed as it would take away lessons that can be taught to children about social interaction.\n\nThe 42-year-old , who works in tech sales , said: \u201cFrom the ages of 10 to 16, these are formative years, it\u2019s also a time when many of them build deeper relationships, learn about social interaction and acceptance from others is important.\u201d\n\nExperts said that unlike a ban, the Code of Practice for Online Safety for App Distribution Services offers more targeted controls for children.\n\nDr Chew Han Ei, an adjunct senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies , said the code focuses on app stores as gatekeepers of the digital ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt is practical and less rigid than a blanket ban,\u201d said Dr Chew. \u201cBy placing responsibility on app stores to manage access and content, the code offers a targeted solution that can be adapted for different age groups.\u201d\n\nLike many parents, Madam Look walks a fine line between giving Claire, now 12 , freedom to manage her own screen time and shielding her from potential harms.\n\nClaire began using Instagram and YouTube when she was 11, limited to 30 minutes per day , said Madam Look, who configured settings to lock her daughter\u2019s phone in sleep mode at night.\n\nMadam Look added: \u201cI set limits because at that young age, she was not able to exercise self-control. The content can be quite addictive.\u201d\n\nIf a ban were to be imposed, it is easy to imagine children, who are already exposed to mobile phones, turning to unknown sources to socialise online, creating an even larger headache for parents, she said.\n\n\u201cI think that the blanket ban in Australia is a very blunt tool,\u201d Madam Look said, adding that teenagers should slowly learn to manage their use of social media, rather than to have it totally removed.\n\n\u201cI have seen my daughter learn useful skills from social media, and found healthy inspiration to be creative in schoolwork and her personal hobbies,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would lose all of that.\u201d\n\nGet the ST Smart Parenting newsletter for expert advice.

            "article_content": "GUEST OPINION: The retail landscape is undergoing a remarkable transformation fueled by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). From physical storefronts to digital platforms, AI is revolutionizing the industry, reshaping operations, and redefining customer experiences. But what lies ahead for the future of AI in the retail industry ?\n\nLet\u2019s explore the key trends and innovations driving this change.\n\nWhat does AI mean for retail?\n\nArtificial intelligence refers to the capability of machines to perform tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence, such as data analysis and decision-making. Its integration into the retail sector is unlocking unprecedented levels of efficiency and customer satisfaction. Whether online or offline, AI is paving the way for a smarter, more responsive, and customer-focused retail experience.\n\nAI transformations in online retail\n\nIn the e-commerce space, AI is centred on enhancing personalization and streamlining customer interactions. By analyzing massive amounts of customer data - from browsing history to purchase behaviour - AI delivers tailored experiences that feel intuitive and engaging. Tools like recommendation systems, AI chatbots, and visual search technologies create a seamless shopping journey.\n\nConsumers benefit from faster, more convenient interactions, while retailers enjoy higher conversion rates and increased sales. These innovations underscore the growing importance of the future of AI in the retail industry for e-commerce.\n\nAI\u2019s role in physical retail\n\nAI\u2019s influence is not limited to online platforms. Physical stores are leveraging AI-powered tools such as cameras and sensors to optimize operations and enhance customer experiences. These technologies monitor foot traffic, track inventory levels, and provide real-time product recommendations.\n\nFor shoppers, this translates to a more personalized and efficient experience, bridging the gap between the convenience of digital platforms and the tactile benefits of in-store shopping. Such advancements illustrate how the future of AI in the retail industry is shaping brick-and-mortar spaces.\n\nEmerging trends in AI for retail\n\nAccording to a study by Fortune Business Insights, the global AI market in retail, valued at $4.84 billion in 2021, is projected to reach an astounding $52.94 billion by 2029. This exponential growth highlights several transformative trends.\n\nAI for retail automation\n\nRepetitive tasks like inventory tracking, pricing updates, and customer support are prime candidates for AI automation. By automating these processes, retailers can focus on strategic priorities and reduce operational inefficiencies.\n\nAI tools excel at analyzing sales data to identify trends, forecast demand, and optimize inventory management. They also simplify catalogue updates, ensuring product descriptions, availability, and pricing remain accurate across platforms.\n\nAI for customer service\n\nIn today\u2019s competitive market, superior customer service is essential. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are revolutionizing online retail by offering 24/7, human-like support. These tools handle customer inquiries, guide users through purchases, and personalize interactions based on past behaviours.\n\nIn physical stores, smart kiosks and mobile apps enhance customer engagement. Features like facial recognition enable real-time, personalized assistance, taking customer service to the next level.\n\nAI for retail personalization\n\nPersonalization is a cornerstone of the future of AI in the retail industry. Advanced AI technologies like natural language processing, visual search, and voice recognition help online shoppers find desired products quickly, providing a seamless experience.\n\nIn-store, AI-driven automated checkout systems simplify the payment process. By using computer vision and image recognition, these systems eliminate the need for traditional checkouts, enhancing convenience and hygiene for customers.\n\nAI for supply chain optimization\n\nEfficient supply chain management is another area where AI is making waves. By analyzing data on traffic, weather, and delivery schedules, AI tools optimize transportation routes, ensuring timely deliveries and reducing costs.\n\nAdditionally, AI enables real-time tracking and demand forecasting, helping retailers align stock levels with customer needs, minimizing delays, and improving overall logistics.\n\nAI for loss prevention\n\nAI is reshaping retail security by leveraging technologies like facial recognition and predictive analytics. These tools identify potential theft risks and monitor suspicious behaviour, enabling proactive loss prevention strategies. Predictive analytics also helps retailers design store layouts and allocate resources effectively, reducing shrinkage and improving overall security.\n\nReal-world application: Amazon Go\n\nAmazon Go provides a glimpse into the future of AI in the retail industry. These cashierless stores utilize cutting-edge AI technologies, including computer vision, IoT sensors, and deep learning algorithms, to create a seamless shopping experience. Shoppers can enter the store using a QR code, select items, and exit without waiting in line. Payments are processed automatically, showcasing how AI can redefine convenience and efficiency in retail.\n\nEmpower your retail business with Sky Solution\n\nLooking to prepare your business for the future of AI in the retail industry?

            "article_content": "Value Stream Management (VSM) was all the rage a few years ago, but now there\u2019s a new contender for measuring how much value software is driving: Software Engineering Intelligence.\n\n\u201cWhile Value Stream Management continued to lose steam in 2024, we also saw the fast emergence of Software Engineering Intelligence (SEI) to take its place,\u201d Derek Holt, CEO of Digital.ai, told SD Times while making predictions for 2025.\n\nHolt was interviewed in the most recent episode of our podcast to talk more about this trend, explaining that SEI is the application of both data driven insights and predictive AI to measure and improve not only the process of delivering software, but also the outcomes of that software development.\n\n\u201cThis includes both rear view metrics of how things have trended in the past, but also looks at predictive insights to be able to identify areas for improvement, risk avoidance, etc,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the rear view mirror is smaller than the windshield in a car, and we think it is that balance of both views that are going to help organizations just get better and better at predictably, building and delivering great software.\u201d\n\nThere are a couple of different reasons why Holt believes SEI will gain more traction in the year ahead.\n\nFirst, organizations are continuing to look at how to mature the way they build and deliver software.\n\nSecond, there is pressure on companies to adopt AI in their software development process, but they don\u2019t necessarily have the data to justify whether or not AI has resulted or will result in improvements.\n\nThird, we now have the technology stack needed to gather structured and unstructured data from third-party tools and provide it in a dashboard and perform predictive insights on that data.\n\nLooking back to VSM, it really was designed to help answer two questions:\n\nHow good are we at building software? How good is the software we build right now?\n\n\u201cI know those are a lot of the same words, but they\u2019re wildly different things,\u201d Holt explained. \u201cI could be really great at building, let\u2019s say, a new smartphone, but if the smartphone isn\u2019t wanted by anybody, it doesn\u2019t really matter that I was good at building it. And at the same time, I could have the best idea for the next generation smartphone, but if I don\u2019t have a way to get the parts, manufacturing, and distribution, that idea is not worth a lot either.\u201d\n\nHolt believes that SEI is a part of the overall vision for VSM. It\u2019s not a complete departure from VSM, but rather a recognition of that first question.\n\nHe explained that development teams often have an easier time understanding how good they are at building software, and a harder time understanding the value they derive from that software, as that can vary based on business model, business strategy, market conditions, etc.\n\nHolt also emphasized that it\u2019s not an \u201ceither or\u201d when it comes to VSM vs SEI. \u201cI think it\u2019s a subset, and hopefully we continue to build towards the original vision of value stream management, just in a kind of a step function over time.\u201d\n\nFor teams looking to implement SEI, Holt says there are a few prerequisites. First, whatever vendors they\u2019re working with need to have ways to pull data from those systems, as no singular data source can provide that 360 degree view that is needed.\n\nAnother important foundation is the ability to scale. \u201cThese things are easy to demo,\u201d Holt said. \u201cThey\u2019re harder to scale across an enterprise. So I would really encourage folks, as they\u2019re doing evaluations, to make sure that they\u2019re partnering with folks that have done this at scale. And that\u2019s not just scale of data, it\u2019s also scale of users, scale of continuing to mature \u2026 getting value right away, but also then expanding the purview in terms of the types of intelligence that you\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\nHe also went on to say that it\u2019s important to have that 360 degree view so that you can ensure you\u2019re not only able to look back, but also predict future outcomes.\n\nHis final piece of advice is to not overanalyze the options in a way that prevents you from getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very easy to look at this space and to spend a year debating and having a bit of analysis paralysis \u2026 But the very first view you get, the very first aggregation of multiple data sources that gives you insights into your business, even just one is better than where you were before. And so this is a journey, not a destination, and a key piece there is taking that first step. So I would just encourage folks to get started instead of waiting for perfection.\u201d"

            "article_content": "OpenAI announced a preview of Operator, an artificial intelligence agent, that will collaborate with a wide range of commerce-driven companies. While still early, analysts believe these agents could drive engagement shifts across the Internet, while adding that details of the product and its partners remove a key overhang for online travel agencies. Analysts also expect advancements in agentic capabilities to continue, as well as further product expansion from Google (GOOGL), Meta (META) and others.\n\nInvest with Confidence: Follow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return.\n\nJoin thousands of data-driven investors \u2013 Build your Smart Portfolio for personalized insights.\n\nOPERATOR: OpenAI announced on Thursday that it is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose artificial intelligence agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions and tasks. Using its own browser, it can look at a webpage and interact with it by typing, clicking, and scrolling, OpenAI said in a blog post. Operator is coming to U.S. users on ChatGPT\u2019s $200 Pro subscription plan first, the company said. It plans to expand Operator to Plus, Team and Enterprise users and integrate its capabilities directly into ChatGPT in the future once it is \u201cconfidence in its safety and usability at scale.\u201d\n\nOpenAI explained that \u201cOperator can be asked to handle a wide variety of repetitive browser tasks such as filling out forms, ordering groceries, and even creating memes. The ability to use the same interfaces and tools that humans interact with on a daily basis broadens the utility of AI, helping people save time on everyday tasks while opening up new engagement opportunities for businesses.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S NOTABLE: Operator directly competes with an earlier release from Anthropic, the Amazon (AMZN)-backed artificial intelligence startup behind the Claude chatbot.\n\nThe generative AI market includes OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as Amazon, Google, Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta. Google is investing a further $1B into OpenAI competitor Anthropic, The Financial Times\u2019 George Hammond, Madhumitda Murgia, and Arash Massoudi reported this week. Google had already committed about $2B to Anthropic and is now increasing its stake in the group, according to four people with knowledge of the situation. Under outgoing commissioner Lina Khan, the FTC had targeted investments from Google and Amazon into Anthropic and Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI, reviewing the impact of the deals on competition, but Khan is stepping down in the coming weeks, the FT noted.\n\nANALYST COMMENTARY: In its 2025 outlook, Morgan Stanley discussed how it expects to see key developments in agentic offerings in 2025 and one month into the year \u201cwe have already seen releases from OpenAI and Perplexity.\u201d Google has also previewed agentic/reasoning capabilities with Deep Research, Project Astra, Project Mariner and in travel both in its Gemini 2.0 release and at Google I/O 2024, and Meta has spoken to significant opportunities for the creation of agentic AI systems with advanced reasoning. While still early days, with continued technological and cost improvements in reinforcement learning, chain of thought, and test time compute, the firm expects advancements in agentic capabilities to continue. It also expects further product expansion from Google, Meta and others.\n\nSaying that the new OpenAI agent is a best-case outcome for online travel agencies, Jefferies said that while rumors of the announcement contributed to high single digit downside for Booking and Expedia (EXPE) in recent days on fears of disintermediation, the details provided on Friday helped soothe those fears given that OpenAI\u2019s list of partners included Booking. The partnerships support the firm\u2019s view that AI agents will eventually be another performance channel that could help consolidate share around scaled Internet names. Jefferies said the announcement from OpenAI removes a key OTA overhang and suggests a path for OTA market share gains.\n\nAlso commenting on OpenAI\u2019s Operator, JPMorgan noted that the company is collaborating with a wide range of commerce-driven companies, including DoorDash (DASH), Instacart (CART), Booking (BKNG), Uber (UBER), eBay (EBAY), TripAdvisor (TRIP), and others. The firm believes that, for now, it is also blocked by a number of services, including Google\u2019s YouTube and Reddit (RDDT). While it is still \u201cvery early\u201d and much depends on how Operator and others improve over time, JPMorgan believes these agents could drive engagement shifts across the Internet, with a mix of positive and negative implications across its coverage universe.\n\nThough currently only in previews, BofA expects OpenAI\u2019s Operator could become available more broadly potentially later this year for those paying $20/month. During testing, users still need to input passwords, confirm significant actions, and approve high-stakes transactions, so the firm doesn\u2019t expect an immediate impact. OpenAI will also publish its model so that developers build their own Computer Using Agents. BofA believes OpenAI\u2019s collaborations with DoorDash, Uber, and Instacart are in the early stages, but could possibly deepen in the long-term and allow for more streamlined ordering or additional services."

            "article_content": "FOB China prices for Mono PERC wafers remained steady this week, with Mono PERC M10 and G12 wafers priced at $0.144 per pc and $0.208/pc, respectively. Meanwhile, FOB China prices for n-type M10 and G12 wafers experienced slight increases, reaching $0.149/pc and $0.196/pc, respectively, reflecting a growth of 2.05% and 1.55% compared to the previous week.\n\nSince the start of 2025, n-type wafer prices have risen for three consecutive weeks, driven by production cuts and lower inventory levels. Large-scale production cuts by wafer companies since Q3 2024 have effectively reduced market inventory to about two weeks of production, significantly lower than the inventory levels of polysilicon and modules.\n\nThese developments have led wafer companies to raise their operating rates since early January, with the overall average now exceeding 50%. As a result, January wafer output is expected to reach approximately 46 GW, up 5.5% from 43.61 GW in October 2024.\n\nThe sustainability of the wafer price increase depends on a potential rebound in solar cell transaction prices, industry participants note. They also caution that wafer operating rates in the coming weeks will be critical. A significant rise in operating rates driven by higher prices could risk price drops after the Chinese New Year, as the current vast production capacity may quickly drive inventory levels back to high levels.\n\nAnother recent trend in the Chinese market is the sluggish sales of rectangular G12R (182 mm x 210 mm) wafers, which have driven prices downward. Sources attribute this to the rapid production ramp-up of this size across both upstream and downstream segments, surpassing its adoption by end users. Consequently, an oversupply of this specification has developed before it could gain traction as a mainstream product.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security expanded its ban list of China-based entities, adding four ingot and wafer manufacturers, including a subsidiary of a prominent solar integrated manufacturer. The action was taken on the grounds that these entities were found to source polysilicon from regions in China that do not comply with traceability requirements.\n\nInsiders widely believe that this U.S. decision will theoretically support increased demand for global polysilicon, though its impact has not yet been fully realized. It is also expected to further hinder the export of Chinese wafers and the modules derived from these wafer suppliers to the U.S. With these manufacturers excluded from the U.S. export market, reduced competition may stabilize or even increase wafer and module prices in the U.S. This move aligns with prior market expectations and reflects the U.S.\u2019 strategic intent to implement energy-related policies aimed at minimizing reliance on components associated with China.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury updated safe harbor tables this week, introducing new default component cost percentages to account for the premium customers will pay for U.S.-made wafers, aiming to incentivize domestic wafer manufacturing. The bonus is seen as a \u201cdirect complement\u201d to the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit. While the inclusion of wafers in the guidance is considered significant, industry players remain skeptical about its impact on procurement activities or wafer manufacturing plans in the U.S.\n\nOPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities.

            "date": "Security Boulevard14h",
            "source": "Security Boulevard",
            "article_content": "When I started working with cloud architecture a decade ago, running critical workloads across multiple cloud providers would have seemed needlessly complex. Today, it\u2019s becoming the norm. Companies are embracing multi-cloud strategies not just because they want to avoid vendor lock-in, but because different providers excel at other things. The challenge? Security becomes exponentially more difficult when you\u2019re working across distributed architectures. After years of building cloud-based applications for global enterprises, I\u2019ve learned that the old perimeter-based security models just don\u2019t cut it anymore \u2013 we need a new framework that tackles architectural security and compliance head-on.\n\nThe adoption of multi-cloud deployments presents challenges that extend far beyond simple workload distribution. Each cloud provider brings security models, compliance certifications and native services. This diversity offers powerful capabilities but creates significant hurdles in maintaining consistent security controls and compliance standards across environments.\n\nEncyption Challenge\n\nOne significant challenge I\u2019ve faced was ensuring consistent encryption standards across AWS and other cloud providers for a data analytics pipeline. The project involved processing sensitive customer data, and we needed to maintain end-to-end encryption while leveraging services from both clouds. This challenge was solved by implementing a custom key management service that integrated with AWS KMS and the other providers\u2019 key management solution, allowing for a single source of truth for encryption keys. At the same time, ensuring data remained protected as it moved between cloud environments.\n\nThis encryption challenge highlighted a broader truth about multi-cloud architectures: Identity and access management form the cornerstone of secure cross-cloud operations. The secure multi-cloud architecture is built around one core thing: Unified identity management. Organizations can\u2019t easily manage identities across the multitude of cloud services they use when each has its identity system. So, to gain efficiency and effectiveness, and to have a semblance of personality across the cloud, organizations need a way to manage all those identities (and all those accesses) in a unified manner. If you get it right, that setup also provides the comfy feel of perspiration across the entire cloud ecosystem.\n\nMulti-cloud environments necessitate special consideration for data protection. Organizations should set up classification systems that work across all cloud boundaries and ensure that sensitive data is classified and receives the appropriate protection no matter where it is stored or used. This should be done through a seamless, yet secure, infrastructure across the cloud boundary; encryption standards should meet the highest common denominator across the cloud service providers; powerful data residency controls should govern where the data is allowed to live and operate; and a consistent key management strategy throughout the multi-cloud architecture should ensure that only cloud-visible personnel have access to the necessary keys to unlock the data.\n\nThe careful crafting of network security architecture is needed in multi-cloud environments to provide consistent protection while taking advantage of each provider\u2019s strengths. This includes interconnecting the different cloud providers securely and implementing consistent micro-segmentation policies. The outcome we\u2019re looking for is a unified security posture that lets us maintain visibility and control across all the cloud environments we happen to be in.\n\nTo illustrate these network security principles in action, consider our implementation for a high-traffic e-commerce platform. Our platform uses AWS Transit Gateway to implement a hub-and-spoke network architecture that connects multiple VPCs across different AWS regions. We extended this model to include our multi-cloud resources by setting up dedicated interconnects and implementing consistent security groups and NACLs across all environments. We also utilized AWS Network Firewall to create a centralized inspection point for all cross-cloud traffic, allowing us to implement uniform security policies regardless of the traffic\u2019s origin or destination.\n\nThe technical controls alone cannot secure multi-cloud environments. Organizations must conduct cloud security architecture reviews before implementing any multi-cloud solution. These reviews should focus on:\n\nData flow patterns between clouds\n\nAuthentication and authorization requirements\n\nCompliance obligations across all relevant jurisdictions\n\nCompleting these tasks thoroughly and diligently will ensure that multi-cloud security is baked into the architectural layer between the clouds and in the clouds themselves.\n\nWhile thorough architecture reviews establish the foundation, automation brings these security principles to life at scale. Automation provides a major advantage to security operations for multi-cloud environments. By treating infrastructure and security as code, organizations can achieve consistent configurations across clouds, implement automated security testing and enable fast response to security events. This helps with the overall security and operational overhead because it allows us to do more with less and to reduce human error.\n\nOur security operations experienced a substantial enhancement when we moved to automated compliance checks. Still, we did not just throw AWS services at the problem. We engaged our security team deeply in the process. We had them create rules that continuously monitored our multi-cloud environment for compliance with PCI DSS standards. This automation allowed us to detect and remediate misconfigurations in near real-time. If we miss something in the continuous compliance monitoring, we have a CI/CD pipeline check to catch it before changes are deployed. All told, this saves us an impressive number of hours each year. Moreover, it moves us closer to a state in which we can confidently assert that we are compliant, on top of the auditability problems plaguing us previously.\n\nSeveral emerging trends are molding security demands as multi-cloud architectures rapidly develop. The burgeoning edge computing is broadening the security perimeter, whereas cloud-tethered zero trust is becoming the norm. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence and machine learning are being integrated to bolster security monitoring and response capabilities, producing a more proactive security posture.\n\nHow Multi-Cloud Security Might Evolve\n\nBased on my experience working with large-scale distributed systems, I envision the future of multi-cloud security evolving in several key areas:\n\nUnified Security Orchestration: I foresee the development of more sophisticated, cloud-agnostic security orchestration platforms. These will provide a single pane of glass for managing security across all cloud environments, automatically adapting to each provider\u2019s specific implementations while maintaining consistent policies.\n\nAI-Driven Threat Detection: As our systems grow more complex, AI and machine learning will play an increasingly crucial role in identifying and responding to security threats. I expect to see more advanced, self-learning systems that can correlate events across multiple cloud environments to detect sophisticated, distributed attacks that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n\nQuantum-Resistant Encryption: With the looming threat of quantum computing, I anticipate a shift towards implementing quantum-resistant encryption algorithms across all cloud environments. This will be crucial for maintaining long-term data security in a multi-cloud world.\n\nAutomated Compliance Management: The future will likely bring more advanced automation in compliance management. I envision systems that can automatically adjust configurations across multiple clouds to maintain compliance with changing regulations, reducing the manual overhead associated with multi-cloud compliance.\n\nEdge-to-Cloud Security: As edge computing grows, I expect to see more integrated security solutions that seamlessly extend from edge devices through multiple clouds. This will likely involve new protocols and standards for maintaining consistent security postures across highly distributed architectures.\n\nIdentity-Centric Security: I anticipate a shift towards fully identity-centric security models that go beyond current identity and access management. These models will use advanced behavioral analytics and continuous authentication to make access decisions regardless of a resource\u2019s cloud environment.\n\nBlockchain for Multi-Cloud Integrity: I foresee potential applications of blockchain technology for maintaining verifiable audit trails and ensuring data integrity across multi-cloud environments, particularly for highly regulated industries.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can create more resilient, efficient and secure multi-cloud architectures that can adapt to the evolving threat landscape while supporting the growing complexity of modern enterprise applications.\n\nThese emerging trends and future directions aren\u2019t just theoretical possibilities \u2013 they\u2019re essential steps for organizations building secure multi-cloud architectures today. As someone who has witnessed and participated in the transformation of cloud security over the past decade, I\u2019m convinced that success in this space requires technical excellence and strategic foresight. The framework outlined here provides a foundation, but staying ahead of evolving threats and technological capabilities will require continuous adaptation and innovation."

            "article_content": "One of the key factors for the sustenance of eight billion people globally has been agriculture, and that sector, in turn, has been fuelled by fertilisers such as ammonia. However, due to high volumes, ammonia production contributes significantly to carbon emissions.\n\nBut this is likely to soon change.\n\nA new study published in scientific journal Joule has revealed a new ground-breaking method to produce ammonia under moderate subsurface conditions. Many believe this could impact the agriculture sector the world over and even reduce carbon emissions.\n\nAmmonia is a critical component of fertilisers and an emerging green fuel. For over a century it was produced by using Haber-Bosch process under high temperature and pressure.\n\nThe report claims ammonia can be produced in Earth\u2019s subsurface as it houses similar conditions, in turn offering a sustainable and energy-efficient alternative.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings have prompted the creation of Addis Energy, a company aiming to commercialise the process. Speaking to MIT Technology Review, Addis Energy\u2019s CEO Mark Bennett said, \u201cOur technology has the potential to address the dual challenges of food security and climate change by revolutionising ammonia production.\u201d\n\nAmmonia: Key to food systems and clean energy\n\nAmmonia is essential for modern agriculture, with most fertilisers relying on this compound to boost crop yields. However, the current Haber-Bosch process used to produce ammonia is highly energy-intensive, consuming 1-2% of global energy annually and emitting about 1.8% of global carbon dioxide. This dependence on fossil fuels has drawn widespread criticism as industries worldwide now face an increasing pressure to \u201cdecarbonise.\u201d\n\nThe discovery opens new possibilities for using naturally occurring chemical reactions to produce ammonia at lower energy inputs. The research team demonstrated that nitrogen and hydrogen react with specific minerals to form ammonia, mimicking subsurface geological processes.\n\nThe lead researcher, Dr Emily Rhodes, explained, \u201cThis method not only replicates natural processes but also provides an opportunity to dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of ammonia production.\u201d\n\nBroader applications and industry impact\n\nThe implications extend beyond agriculture. Ammonia is also emerging as a clean fuel for sectors like shipping, where its high energy density and zero carbon emissions make it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. This breakthrough could accelerate ammonia\u2019s adoption by addressing one of its major drawbacks: The emissions associated with its production.\n\nThe formation of Addis Energy highlights the growing focus on translating scientific discoveries into industrial applications. Bennett noted that the company aims to build pilot facilities to demonstrate the technology\u2019s scalability. \u201cOur priority is to ensure the process is not only environmentally sustainable but also economically competitive with existing methods,\u201d he said.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nWhile the technology shows promise, significant challenges remain. Scaling the process from the lab to commercial operations will require substantial investment and validation. Additionally, existing infrastructure tailored to the Haber-Bosch method may need significant adaptations to accommodate this new approach.\n\nExperts also point to the regulatory landscape as a key factor. Any new ammonia production technology must meet strict safety and environmental standards, particularly as the chemical has dual-use applications in agriculture and energy.\n\nA step towards sustainability\n\nThis discovery aligns with broader global efforts to reduce industrial emissions and transition to sustainable energy systems. If successful, Addis Energy\u2019s innovation could reshape two major industries \u2014 agriculture and shipping \u2014 while contributing to climate goals.\n\nDr Rhodes emphasised the potential impact: \u201cThis is a pivotal step toward transforming a vital yet carbon-intensive process into one that aligns with a sustainable future.\u201d\n\nThe next decade will determine whether this breakthrough can move from promise to practice, but its potential to drive change is undeniable."

            "article_content": "Part of our International Year of Quantum Science and Technology coverage From public talks and hackathons to festivals and careers events, Tushna Commissariat gives you a whistle-stop tour of key activities in the IYQ calendar across the UK\n\nIn June 1925, a relatively unknown physics postdoc by the name of Werner Heisenberg developed the basic mathematical framework that would be the basis for the first quantum revolution. Heisenberg, who would later win the Nobel Prize for Physics, famously came up with quantum mechanics on a two-week vacation on the tiny island of Helgoland off the coast of Germany, where he had gone to cure a bad bout of hay fever.\n\nNow, a century later, we are on the cusp of a second quantum revolution, with quantum science and technologies growing rapidly across the globe. According to the State of Quantum 2024 report, a total of 33 countries around the world currently have government initiatives in quantum technology, of which more than 20 have national strategies with large-scale funding. The report estimates that up to $50bn in public cash has already been committed.\n\nIt\u2019s a fitting tribute, then, that the United Nations (UN) has chosen 2025 to be the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ). They hope that the year will raise global awareness of the impact that quantum physics and its applications have already had on our world. The UN also aims to highlight to the global public the myriad potential future applications of quantum technologies and how they could help tackle universal issues \u2013 from climate and clean energy to health and infrastructure \u2013 while also addressing the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals.\n\nThe Institute of Physics (IOP), which publishes Physics World, is one of the IYQ\u2019s six \u201cfounding partners\u201d alongside the German (DPG) and American physical societies (APS), SPIE, Optica and the Chinese Optical Society. \u201cThe UNESCO International Year of Quantum is a wonderful opportunity to spread the word about quantum research and technology and the transformational opportunities it is opening up\u201d says Tom Grinyer, chief executive of the IOP. \u201cThe Institute of Physics is co-ordinating the UK and Irish elements of the year, which mark the 100th anniversary of the first formulation of quantum mechanics, and we are keen to celebrate the milestone, making sure that as many people as possible get the opportunity to find out more about this fascinating area of science and technology,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cIYQ provides the opportunity for societies and organizations around the world to come together in marking both the 100-year history of the field, as well as the longer-term real-world impact that quantum science is certain to have for decades to come,\u201d says Tim Smith, head of portfolio development at IOP Publishing. \u201cQuantum science and technology represents one of the most exciting and rapidly developing areas of science today, encompassing the global physical-sciences community in a way that connects scientific wonder with fundamental research, technological innovation, industry, and funding programmes worldwide.\u201d\n\nTaking shape\n\nThe official opening ceremony for IYQ takes place on 4\u20135 February at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, France, although several countries, including Germany and India, held their own launches in advance of the main event . Working together, the IOP and IOP Publishing have developed a wide array of quantum resources, talks, conferences, festivals and public-themed events planned as a part of the UK\u2019s celebrations for IYQ.\n\nIn late February, meanwhile, the Royal Society \u2013 the world\u2019s oldest continuously active learned society \u2013 will host a two-day quantum conference. Dubbed \u201cQuantum Information\u201d, it will bring together scientists, industry leaders and public-sector stakeholders to discuss the current challenges involved in quantum computing, networks and sensing systems.\n\nIn Scotland, the annual Edinburgh Science Festival , which takes place in April, will likely include a special \u201cquantum explorers\u201d exhibit and workshop by the UK\u2019s newly launched National Quantum Computing Centre. Elsewhere, the Quantum Software Lab at the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh is hosting a month-long \u201cQuantum Fringe 2025\u201d event across Scotland. It will include a quantum machine-learning school on the Isle of Skye and well as the annual UK Quantum Hackathon, which brings together teams of aspiring coders with industry mentors to tackle practical challenges and develop solutions using quantum computing.\n\nIn June, the Institution of Engineering and Technology is hosting a Quantum Engineering and Technologies conference, as part of its newly launched Quantum technologies and 6G and Future Networks events. The event\u2019s themes include everything from information processing and memories to photon sources and cryptography.\n\nThe IOP will use the focus this year gives us to continue to make the case for the investment in research and development, and support for physics skills, which will be crucial if we are to fully unlock the economic and social potential of the quantum sector\n\nFurther IYQ-themed events will take place at QuAMP, the IOP\u2019s biennial international conference on quantum, atomic and molecular physics in September. Activities culminate in a three-part celebration in November, with a quantum community event led by the IOP\u2019s History of Physics and quantum Business and Innovation Growth (qBIG) special interest groups, a schools event at the Royal Institution, and a public celebration with a keynote speech from University of Surrey quantum physicist and broadcaster Jim Al-Khalili. \u201cThe UK and Ireland already have a globally important position in many areas of quantum research, with the UK, for instance, having established one of the world\u2019s first National Quantum Technology Programmes,\u201d explains Grinyer. \u201cWe will also be using the focus this year gives us to continue to make the case for the investment in research and development, and support for physics skills, which will be crucial if we are to fully unlock the economic and social potential of what is both a fascinating area of research, and a fast growing physics-powered business sector,\u201d he adds.\n\nQuantum careers\n\nWith the booming quantum marketplace, it\u2019s no surprise that employers are on the hunt for many skilled physicists to join the workforce. And indeed, there is a significant scarcity of skilled quantum professionals for the many roles across industry and academia. Also, with quantum research advancing everything from software and machine learning to materials science and drug discovery, your skills will be transferable across the board.\n\nIf you plan to join the quantum workforce, then choosing the right PhD programme, having the right skills for a specific role and managing risk and reward in the emerging quantum industry are all crucial. There are a number of careers events on the IYQ calendar, to learn more about the many career prospects for physicists in the sector. In April, for example, the University of Bristol\u2019s Quantum Engineering Centre for Doctoral Training is hosting a Careers in Quantum event, while the Economist magazine is hosting its annual Commercialising Quantum conference in May.\n\nThere will also be a special quantum careers panel discussion, including top speakers from the UK and the US, as part of our newly launched Physics World Live panel discussions in April. This year\u2019s Physics World Careers 2025 guide has a special quantum focus, and there\u2019ll also be a bumper, quantum-themed issue of the Physics World Briefing in June. The Physics World quantum channel will be regularly updated throughout the year so you don\u2019t miss a thing.\n\nRead all about it\n\nIOP Publishing\u2019s journals will include specially curated content \u2013 from a series of Perspectives articles \u2013 personal viewpoints from leading quantum scientists \u2013 in Quantum Science and Technology. The journal will also be publishing roadmaps in quantum computing, sensing and communication, as well as focus issues on topics such as quantum machine learning and technologies for quantum gravity and thermodynamics in quantum coherent platforms.\n\n\u201cGoing right to the core of IOP Publishing\u2019s own historic coverage we\u2019re excited to be celebrating the IYQ through a year-long programme of articles in Physics World and across our journals, that will hopefully show a wide audience just why everyone should care about quantum science and the people behind it,\u201d says Smith.\n\nOf course, we at Physics World have a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s box full of fascinating quantum articles for the coming year \u2013 from historical features to the latest cutting-edge developments in quantum tech. So keep your eyes peeled."
