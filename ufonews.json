            "article_content": "Last month, on the night of Dec. 7, multiple pilots saw lights in the sky over the Willamette Valley.\n\nAs several outlets reported, an audio recording of air traffic control that went viral features alarm over the lights\u2019 strange movements among pilots of two commercial airliners, United Flight 1596 and Horizon Air Flight 2207, the latter of which had a pilot who reported having seen the same phenomenon \u201ca few times over the last month in the same area\u201d near Eugene.\n\nWhatever they were seeing, it wasn\u2019t showing up on air traffic control\u2019s radar. It was, however, appearing on the crash avoidance system of a small Life Flight plane, Medevac 1LF, heading toward North Bend. Its pilot, Joe Buley, gave the most detailed description:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one way up high and one about at my altitude. Moving in\u2026like a corkscrew pattern. Moving at\u2026extreme speeds... It\u2019s a red circular shape and it keeps zipping out towards the ocean and then coming back in, about 20 miles or closer to us and then zips back out of the ocean.\u201d\n\nThe response from air traffic control: \u201cYou are cleared to maneuver as necessary\u2014a left or right to avoid the UFO out there.\u201d\n\nThis incident was not, by any stretch of the imagination, the first time anybody\u2019s reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. This isn\u2019t even the first time that a United Airlines flight has reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. The region has been an epicenter of postwar UFO sightings, with more people having reported sightings in Portland and Seattle than in any other metro area in the United States since 2000. (The U.S. government now designates such sightings as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d or UAPs.)\n\nIt was here that on June 24, 1947, an amateur pilot named Kenneth Arnold set off a national frenzy after he reported seeing \u201cnine saucerlike aircraft flying in formation\u201d above Southwest Washington while flying from Chehalis to Yakima. (Thus, like \u201cgrunge\u201d and \u201cvegan strip club,\u201d \u201cflying saucer\u201d became a product of the Pacific Northwest.) Ten days later, the crew of United Flight 105 reported a nearly identical experience while flying from Boise to Pendleton.\n\nIn 1950, an Oregon couple named Paul and Evelyn Trent took two pictures on their Kodak of a \u201cdisc-shaped object\u201d that supposedly hovered above their farm outside of McMinnville without emitting any sound. The pictures ended up in Life magazine and remain a point of contention between UFO skeptics and believers.\n\nIn the 75 years since, there\u2019ve been thousands of reported sightings across the Pacific Northwest. Regardless of personal opinions of such things, it\u2019s undeniable that during this time UFOs and little green men have embedded themselves into the cultural fabric of the region, another stitch alongside New Age crystal healers, Bigfoot true believers, and whatever it is that draws people to a full-size replica of Stonehenge on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge. McMinnville and Chehalis both now hold annual UFO festivals; the Royal Canadian Mint issues a coin commemorating a 1970 sighting in British Columbia.\n\nWhat happened last month over the valley, though, was different from anything else that\u2019s come before. The Dec. 7 incident represented legitimate documentation of multiple professional pilots seeing the same things and having the same reaction to them. In that audio recording, an unnamed pilot aboard Horizon Air Flight 2207 can be heard refuting what\u2019s become the standard explanation for what they saw\u2014satellites. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not Starlink, I promise,\u201d he says. \u201cI know what that looks like.\u201d Buley, the pilot of Medevac 1LF, also doubts this explanation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen satellites\u2026stuff like that. This was definitely different,\u201d he told KEZI-TV. (WW reached out to Life Flight Network but was told that Buley and the rest of his crew have declined to speak further on the matter.)\n\nIt\u2019s all very strange. Perhaps the UFO believers are right after all. If they are, and this is a real thing, then the greatest story of all time has been playing out above our backyard. Or maybe it\u2019s nothing at all."

            "article_content": "The author's father, circa 1981. Courtesy of Lyndall Riedel\n\nThere\u2019s one video available on the internet concerning my father, Patrick McGuire. It\u2019s strange. Uploaded to YouTube 15 years ago \u2014 though clearly recorded much earlier \u2014 the video frames another TV screen. There is constant static, and the image is fractured as if the broadcast comes from far away. My father is discussing cattle mutilations under hypnosis.\n\n\u201cWe come up on a cow that was dead. They cut the nose off, tongues out and the sex organs were gone,\u201d he recounts as though he is sleepwalking through a nightmare. He goes on to describe in great detail a \u201cspaceship\u201d that landed on his ranch and took members of his herd \u2015 their distant, terrified animal cries filling those dark prairie nights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne comment below the video reads, \u201cHaving lived and worked with cow-men, can you immagine this guy going to town after this got out publicly. I mean they are a finicky bunch to say the least.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t have to imagine. I grew up with him walking through our small Western town, his life by then fractured like that broadcast. He was completely destitute, picking through my classmates\u2019 garbage, and when a classmate came to school the next day and told me what they saw, their grin, and subsequent laughter, left little to the imagination. However, I then joined in with their laughter. That commenter was right: We are a finicky bunch, to say the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn May 14, 2009, my father passed away in a Colorado hospital due to cancer. He was 67. I did not speak to him before he died. His last years were spent in homelessness, though he hadn\u2019t always lived that way. His last words, so I heard, were about grand conspiracies and sinister deep states, though he hadn\u2019t always spoken about such topics. My father\u2019s legacy in our small Wyoming town \u2015 and inside our family \u2015 is stained with his tales of alien abduction, interstellar prophecy and the insistence he was chosen, though he had not always been chosen. There was a time before my birth when he was obsessed with the lore of his rural community, the spiraling complexities of high school dances and the schemes of enlarging his Roman Catholic family. He was normal, caring and complete. That was before the stars came knocking.\n\nWhen I first saw the bold headline \u201cIntelligence Officials Say U.S. Has Retrieved Craft of Non-Human Origin,\u201d published June 5, 2023, in The Debrief, I initially didn\u2019t think about whether the headline was true. I didn\u2019t contemplate what the recovered crafts might look like or that \u201cnon-human\u201d was just another euphemism for the same thing we have been talking about since 1947 \u2015 I thought about my father.\n\nI can see him now as though he were alive today, black cowboy hat tilted, face tanned and cracked from the high plains sun, saying, \u201cWho\u2019s laughing now?\u201d I\u2019m not laughing anymore, but not because I know what that headline is saying is absolutely true and proof lies just around the corner; I\u2019m not laughing because I should never have laughed in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ranch that once belonged to Patrick McGuire. The author's father claimed this was where he was visited by aliens. Courtesy of David Riedel\n\nIn 2017, The New York Times broke news about a previously unknown Pentagon department: the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). This department was involved in investigating what were formerly called UFOs, now referred to as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). More shifting euphemisms and acronyms for us to track. Since then, the news surrounding these phenomena has steadily grown. There was a congressional hearing in 2022, the creation of a governmental department called the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and a NASA hearing devoted to encountered \u2015 or not encountered \u2015 UAPs. And now a new whistleblower, former intelligence official and AATIP task force member David Grusch, claims a government cover-up. \u201cThese [programs] are retrieving non-human origin technical vehicles, call it spacecraft if you will, non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed,\u201d he stated to NewsNation recently. What once seemed to be the premise for the next \u201dX-Files\u201d reboot has become front page news, gaining mainstream consideration by the serious, the rational, the institutional and the scientific.\n\nIt\u2019s strange to be here in this cultural moment. I think many people feel that to some degree. Whether this is all true or not, it is unmooring to read that U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is demanding disclosure on a subject that, only a decade ago, would have been political suicide to even mention. To read former Pentagon official Lue Elizondo state, \u201cMy personal belief is that there is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone\u201d is surreal, and stranger still is reading about governmental UFO agencies and \u201cBlack Money\u201d in The New York Times.\n\nD.W. Pasulka, author of the 2019 book \u201dAmerican Cosmic,\u201d an exploration of our cultural interaction with the UFO phenomena, recently referred to this specific whistleblower event and to the preceding media coverage as a \u201cparadigm shift,\u201d a fundamental change in the way we conceptualize an issue. \u201cThat is,\u201d she explained, \u201cthere is huge pressure from [the] fringe, then marginal sources that finally initiate a shift in consensus.\u201d And there is an unexpected change in our current moment from the one that preceded it, though now it feels to me \u2014 perhaps, given my family history, more than most \u2014 like there has also been an unexpected change in the past.\n\nThe stigma against people who believe in UFOs may go back to the very birth of the topic itself, when the first reports of UFOs described by Kenneth Arnold went from \u201csaucer,\u201d \u201cdisk\u201d and \u201cpie pan\u201d to sensational terms like \u201cflying saucers\u201d in the press, for which Arnold later stated, \u201cI have, of course, suffered some embarrassment here and there by misquotes and misinformation.\u201d From there, this subject expanded to include tropes like anal probes, stock characters in films living their lonely, manic lives in houses criss-crossed with spiderwebs of yarn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbductees have been satirized on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and in popular beer commercials. Even famed Harvard psychologist Richard J. McNally stated in his past clinical research into the abduction phenomenon that \u201cit occasionally took [a researcher] several tries to record these [abduction] narratives properly. He would sometimes burst out laughing while trying to record these stories with the necessary solemnity.\u201d Insincerity and mockery has shrouded the subject so thoroughly that NASA recently shared at a hearing that \u201cthe stigma associated with reporting UFO sightings \u2014 as well as the harassment of people who work to investigate them \u2014 may be hindering efforts to determine their origins.\u201d\n\nI know that stigma well \u2015 having experienced it from both sides. My father was born and raised in Wyoming and was a rancher like his father and his grandfather. He nestled into a Western community that branded their cattle and youth alike with abstract symbols, that found definition in the regularity of rain and saw acreage as an inappropriate subject to discuss openly. \u201cAsking about the size of a man\u2019s spread is like asking to look at his checkbook,\u201d he said to me once, laughing. And one local recently told me, \u201cHe could break a horse like nobody\u2019s business. He was real sharp like that. Shame what happened to him.\u201d\n\nMy father saw UFOs. Not one, once, like a dinner guest might claim after a few glasses of wine, but many times. Numerous UFOs all at once, up close, lingering in the western Wyoming sky like a nightmare that refused to dissipate come sunrise. In 1981, on NBC\u2019s prime-time TV show \u201cThat\u2019s Incredible,\u201d my father\u2019s story gained national attention as he related, under hypnosis, the specifics of his abduction claims and the demands aliens had made upon his life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA yearbook photo of the author's father as featured in his funeral pamphlet. Courtesy of David Riedel\n\nOn the March 5, 1980, airing of ABC\u2019s \u201dEyewitness News,\u201d he reported that UFOs had landed on his ranch \u201csomewhere around 25, 30 times,\u201d and witnesses present were quoted as saying they saw \u201ctwo or three of them land at separate times\u2026 [and] we stayed and watched the sun come up and we saw two of them, in daylight, hovering in two separate places.\u201d A headline in the March 24, 1981, National Enquirer reads, \u201cFarmer: Aliens Use My Ranch as Their Landing Place,\u201d and it reports that \u201cLocal newspaper and television reporters have also seen strange lights darting over the McGuire ranch.\u201d\n\nThere appeared to be no shortage of witnesses to what was happening on his land. \u201cWhile we cannot be certain of what we saw,\u201d Casper Star Tribune investigative reporter Greg Bean wrote on June 29, 1980, \u201cnone of us left the McGuire farm with as much skepticism as we arrived with. Perhaps we can return.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father\u2019s claims continued. Under hypnosis with famous UFO psychologist R. Leo Sprinkle, he recounted abductions by \u201cStar People,\u201d who demanded his actions in conjunction with their plan for humanity. These Star People told him of a coming climate apocalypse. Following this hypnosis, in a mere handful of years, he was completely destitute without home or family, and he claimed that governmental forces were keeping him that way because of what he saw and said. This story is a regular in the UFO community. In fact, the story of Grusch, the whistleblower, is no surprise to the community, the folks who did believe and respect my father. Covert conspiracies, recovered craft, Nazi research and \u201cnon-human origins\u201d \u2015 almost everything the whistleblower related, my father related to me in similar fashion at some point in my life.\n\nFrom the earliest points in my childhood, I was told that UFOs were nothing to make light of. At every turn, every nightfall, through any locked door \u2014 the Star People could take anyone, even me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father\u2019s description of the Star People, and my subsequent nightmares, matched what our culture has come to expect: 5-foot hairless beings with eyes like colorless pools hovering by my bedside. Soon classmates and teachers alike were smirking at my fears, and then, like any sociological contagion, I began to smirk, too. Then TV took over for my teachers, and \u201cSouth Park, \u201cConeheads\u201d and \u201cMars Attacks\u201d taught me that this was, indeed, a laughing matter.\n\nMy brothers and I laughed when our father talked about the implants and their accompanying pain. We laughed when he claimed he could barely walk after what the Star People did to him. We laughed when he said that he was suing the government for the land they took from him, for destroying his life, for destroying our lives. We laughed. The world laughed.\n\nIf you were not one to laugh about UFOs, then you didn\u2019t say anything at all, and if you did, you hesitantly considered the person you were talking to first, making sure they would not laugh at you, too, before you said anything at all. For many, it was a precarious high-wire if one was to discuss the trauma of the phenomenon or its reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we weren\u2019t getting our meals in school, my father often took us to the local soup kitchen in a basement bunker in the town Episcopal cathedral. I remember best the dampness of the walls and the claustrophobia of dining elbow-to-elbow with the other folks weathering the financial storms outside. Breaking expired bread to share over lentil soup, we were often the only children in attendance. For most of the diners, this was the last place to go. The person across from me would make small talk between spoonfuls, but nothing of the weather or local gossip. In the soup kitchen, the talk was of remote viewing, reverse-engineering and tapping into the collective unconscious for cosmic spiritual growth. I would nod with feigned excitement and encourage them to continue, go deeper. \u201cWhat about the face of Mars?\u201d I would ask with a smile. My brothers and I often failed to contain our laughter.\n\nThe author's childhood home in Bosler, Wyoming. Courtesy of David Riedel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the world contemplates Grusch\u2019s claims, I\u2019m the one who feels ashamed. These potential findings mean only one thing to me: An accounting must be made. How should we address our past mockery and ridicule if it turns out that, hidden in a desert base somewhere, there are indeed crafts, cadavers and photographs of strange visitors?\n\nRegardless of the origins of the metallic orbs, Tic Tac crafts and flying saucers \u2014 and independent of the validity of Grusch\u2019s claims \u2014 we should feel impelled to investigate and rescue a community living with the trauma of the unknown and indescribable. A community we greeted with sneers and derision for so long, a community we pushed to the outskirts of our cultural limits to be safely ignored. If it is all true \u2015 or it is all lies and sickness \u2015 we should approach both valuations with care and consideration, even skepticism, but not with the intense ridicule so many of us have given them for so long.\n\nI cannot say for certain that a shift in the wider cultural acceptance of UFOs is already occurring in our institutions, as some have begun to state, but I can report what has occurred in my own consciousness. Since the \u201950s, intrepid investigators have spent their whole lives and careers dedicated to the phenomenon of UFOs and abductions, and here we are, possibly closer to the truth than ever. And yet I somehow feel no closer to understanding my father. I was not at his side while he lay on his deathbed, by choice \u2015 a choice I seemingly made as a child and never reassessed. I chose not to hear his last words, and that\u2019s hard for me to accept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough delusions are commonly encountered in schizophrenia and affective disorder, it turns out that anyone can have them,\u201d Mahzarin Banaji and John Kihlstrom stated in their 1996 research titled, \u201cThe Ordinary Nature of Alien Abduction Memories.\u201d \u201cThey are natural byproducts of our attempts to explain the unusual things that can happen to us.\u201d As has been the tradition with this topic, I have little certainty about what happened to my father; I can only say that something unusual happened to him, then he spent the rest of his life trying to make sense of it. And now I will spend the rest of my life trying to make sense of him.\n\nDavid Riedel, born and educated in Bosler, Wyoming, is a University of Wyoming graduate student whose writing often examines the realities of addiction and mental illness inside this strange, frightening world we all inhabit.

Yesterday, the company unveiled upcoming Galaxy AI enhancements for its Sketch-to-Image tool. It also released a short teaser showcasing a seamless, conversational Galaxy AI experience set to debut on the next-generation flagships.\n\nThe video shows a woman interacting seamlessly with Galaxy AI, asking it to find a pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating, sharing the details with a friend, and adding the information to her calendar \u2014 all in one flow. This suggests that the upcoming Galaxy S25 series will enable Galaxy AI to work across multiple apps on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nThis functionality is likely tied to the next-generation Bixby, which Samsung launched with advanced AI capabilities in China last year. With the Galaxy S25 series, the upgraded Bixby is expected to roll out globally as part of the One UI 7 experience, potentially also making it accessible on older Galaxy flagships.\n\nAs highlighted in Samsung\u2019s latest teaser, the revamped Bixby aims to deliver a more natural and intuitive user experience. It is designed to retrieve information from apps like Calendar or Samsung Internet, understand on-screen context, and seamlessly integrate with apps for tasks such as getting directions or managing schedules.\n\nReserve the next Galaxy for $50 Samsung Credit and more savings!

The visualised podcast, made by Uncanny Media, Bafflegab and CC Lab, will air on BBC Two immediately after the TV episode, bringing fans a frightening Friday night full of 90 minutes of Uncanny. An extended version of the podcast will then be available on BBC Sounds.\n\nCelebrity ghost watchers including the likes of Kiell Smith-Bynoe, Meera Syal and Charlie Cooper as well as Uncanny regular experts such as Evelyn Hollow will join Danny alongside the lead witness at the heart of each story.\n\nUncanny: Post Mortem follows in the footsteps of the hugely successful Traitors: Uncloaked, presented by Ed Gamble, giving listeners exclusive behind the scenes access to The Traitors.\n\nDanny Robins says \"Our Uncanny cases are so intriguing and frankly bloody frightening that after watching an episode you always want to discuss it - chatting over theories on what happened and that biggest of all questions \"do ghosts exist?\" So now, brilliantly, we can do that in Uncanny: Post Mortem, directly after the main show. It's the kind of delicious deep dive you will be desperate to do after getting hooked on each of these strange chilling cases. You'll hear more from me, our experts, witnesses and some brilliant celebrity Uncanny fans. Expect new evidence and new leads! I can't wait!\"\n\nBBC Podcast & Formats Commissioner Rhian Roberts says \"The Uncanny podcast has been going since 2021, with the TV show joining the Uncanny universe last year. We know listeners and viewers absolutely love it, adding a visualised podcast is a great next step. Uncanny: Post Mortem will be where to head to find out just how freaked out we all were, we can be scared together! There are always so many fascinating questions that come into us after an episode of Uncanny, it\u2019s going to be brilliant to have another place to share theories.\"\n\nJack Bootle, the BBC\u2019s Head of Commissioning for Specialist Factual television, says \"The first TV series of Uncanny was a big hit with both sceptics and believers \u2013 and we know many wanted to learn more about the cases Danny was investigating. Uncanny: Post Mortem allows us to take a deeper dive into these spine-tingling stories, and to hear from celebrity fans of the series who may have had their own paranormal experiences. Friday night on BBC Two is about to become very spooky. Watch if you dare.\"\n\nUncanny: Post Mortem is a Bafflegab, Uncanny Media and CC Lab production for BBC Two and BBC Sounds.\n\nUncanny: Post Mortem begins on 31 January and will be available on BBC Two and iPlayer on Fridays immediately after the main show. An extended version of the podcast will be available on BBC Sounds. Previous episodes of Uncanny are available to catch up on BBC Sounds.\n\nRB2"

Sign up to receive the newsletter in your inbox each Monday night.\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter\u2019s funeral last week sparked a new debate about a decades-old song.\n\nFuneral viewers took to social media to argue over whether it was appropriate for \u201cImagine\u201d to be performed at the service in Washington National Cathedral. Some wondered why a song about a world with \u201cno religion\u201d was used to honor a deeply religious man.\n\nCarter reportedly loved the John Lennon classic, as do millions of others around the world. But reports that he handpicked it for his funeral weren\u2019t enough to quiet the debate about what \u201cImagine\u201d says about religion.\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed news about \u201cImagine\u201d since its release in October 1971, last week\u2019s controversy shouldn\u2019t have been surprising.\n\nFor decades, people have argued about its lyrics, questioning whether it should be seen as an atheistic, anti-religious anthem or simply a humanistic one.\n\n\u201cWhile most pop songs are secular by default \u2014 in that they are about the things of this world, making no mention of the divine or spiritual \u2014 \u2018Imagine\u2019 is explicitly secularist. In Lennon\u2019s telling, religion is an impediment to human flourishing \u2014 something to be overcome, transcended,\u201d wrote scholar Phil Zuckerman for The Conversation in 2021.\n\nThe song\u2019s detractors say it blames religion for the world\u2019s problems. Its defenders argue that \u201cImagine\u201d is not opposed to faith in general, just organized religion.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say the debate will never be fully resolved. It\u2019s also safe to say that Carter cared more about song\u2019s peace-related message than its religion-related one.\n\nFresh off the press\n\nPresident Biden celebrates faith as he awards his first Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction\n\nThe Supreme Court debated cat videos, Cold War censorship and TikTok\u2019s future.

It celebrates Trump\u2019s inauguration\n\nPerspective: Finding joy in hamburger buns after a school shooting\n\nA prayer in the U.S. Capitol sparked a unique religion controversy\n\nTerm of the week: Parapsychology\n\nParapsychology refers to the study of alleged paranormal events, like out-of-body experiences.\n\nI stumbled upon the term while reading a fascinating story from The New York Times about the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia.\n\nDOPS researchers specialize in parapsychology, which means they investigate the kinds of phenomena that many of us associate with science fiction. The article focuses on their work on past lives, which involves interviewing children who seem to have been born with memories from a whole different life.\n\n\u201cCommon features in children who claim to have led a previous life include a verbal precocity and mannerisms at odds with that of the rest of the family. Unexplained phobias or aversions have also been thought to have been transferred over from a past existence. In some cases, extreme clarity besets the remembrances: the names, professions and quirks of a different set of relatives, or the particularities of the streets they used to live on and sometimes even recalling obscure historical events \u2014 details the child couldn\u2019t possibly have known about,\u201d The New York Times reported.\n\nAlthough the Division of Perception Studies is affiliated with UVA, its work is controversial, as is the field of parapsychology as a whole.\n\nDOPS is funded entirely by private donations, per The New York Times.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading...\n\nTwo new billboards in the Salt Lake City area call for support for the Jewish community. My colleague Caitlin Keith spoke with the organization funding them, JewBelong, about their unique effort to combat antisemitism.\n\nI\u2019ve read a lot of stories about church closures, but few so powerful as Bobby Ross Jr.\u2019s column for The Christian Chronicle about the final days of his parents\u2019 small church.\n\nThe Atlantic has published several thought-provoking articles recently about America\u2019s loneliness crisis. My personal favorite is about the importance of hosting parties. Here\u2019s my new life motto, which I got from the piece: \u201cWe are obligated to create the social world we want.\u201d\n\nOdds and ends\n\nI recently started watching the sitcom \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond\u201d from the beginning, and I was amused by an episode featuring a board game about moral dilemmas. As it turns out, \u201cScruples\u201d is a real game and, if you ask me, a great way to start good-natured arguments about what it means to be a good person."

All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."

            "article_content": "The sprawling grounds of France\u2019s opulent Palace of Versailles are not only a masterpiece of landscaping, but a mark of 17th-century engineering innovation. The property\u2019s ornamental fountains and ponds, for example, were only made possible by a specially built machine that pulled water from the Seine and pushed it up a steep hill to Versailles.\n\nThe machine was designed at the request of the French king Louis XIV\u2014the monarch who commissioned Versailles, also known as the Sun King. His and his successors\u2019 courts are mainly remembered for ostentatious finery, but their immense wealth also enabled discovery, and Versailles turned into a hotbed for science: a theme explored by a new exhibition at the Science Museum in London: \u201cVersailles: Science and Splendor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe exhibition highlights how science flourished at Versailles, from the kings\u2019 personal interest in luxurious scientific instruments and spectacular demonstrations, to its strategic role beyond the palace through newly founded institutions and scientific expeditions,\u201d says Glyn Morgan, the museum\u2019s curatorial lead for exhibitions, in a statement.\n\nThe show spans the 17th and 18th centuries, covering the reigns of Louis XIV (who founded the French Academy of Sciences in 1666), Louis XV and Louis XVI (who was executed in 1793 during the French Revolution). Through more than 120 artifacts, the exhibition illustrates the importance of art and science in the French royal court.\n\nMany of the objects show innovations in medicine, such as a curved scalpel designed by Louis XIV\u2019s royal surgeon, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9lix. When the king developed a royal anal fistula, his surgeon had to invent a customized scalpel. F\u00e9lix tested his tool on local peasants, killing several in the process. As the Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Jones writes, \u201cThe rehearsals worked: He fixed the royal fistula and Louis XIV lived on until 1715, his 72-year reign a world record.\u201d\n\nUnder the reign of Louis XV (who ruled between 1715 and 1774), a midwife called Madame du Coudray became a powerful force against French infant mortality. The king hired her to travel throughout rural France to train other midwives in the mechanics of birth, employing \u201csophisticated life-sized mannequins,\u201d per the statement. Du Coudray ultimately educated more than 5,000 women and physicians, and her last surviving model is on display in the exhibition.\n\nAfter Louis XV died of smallpox, his son and successor Louis XVI announced that the royal family would get inoculated. Included in the exhibition are posters made to reassure the public of the strategy\u2019s success.\n\nScience at Versailles extended to the wonders of the natural world. French botanists grew and studied exotic plants. Versailles had a menagerie stocked with animals like coatis and cassowaries. Visitors to the Science Museum will be able to see the menagerie\u2019s most famous resident: Louis XV\u2019s rhinoceros, given to the king by a French governor based in India and later dissected and taxidermied upon its death.\n\n\u201cAs it was studied by scientists, it became incredibly important to our growing zoological knowledge,\u201d as Morgan tells the Observer\u2019s Vanessa Thorpe. \u201cThe photographs really did not do justice to just how impressive and characterful it is. The skin is almost jet black.\u201d\n\nAlso on display are philosopher Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s handwritten, annotated French translation of Isaac Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica; the watch made for Louis XVI\u2019s wife, Marie Antoinette, by Abraham-Louis Breguet; and an early map of the moon drawn by Jean-Dominique Cassini in 1679. The French Revolution claimed the lives of some of the French royal court\u2019s thinkers, but their advances were permanent. Per the Guardian, \u201cScience strode on.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoyal ambition, scientific knowledge and ideals of beauty culminated at Versailles in spectacular demonstrations and brilliant innovations from the brightest minds of the time,\u201d says Ian Blatchford, director and chief executive of the Science Museum Group, in the statement. \u201cWe are thrilled to introduce our visitors to these fascinating stories through the stunning objects on display.\u201d\n\n\u201cVersailles: Science and Splendor\u201d is on view at the Science Museum in London through April 21, 2025."

But the home security technology unveiled at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) had our attention because of what it means for homeowners\u2019 safety, convenience, and savings.\n\nBased on what CES presented, we saw several home security trends emerge for protecting property, family, and packages. With corresponding technology offering everything from better sensors to sleeker designs, these are our predictions for home safety and security in 2025.\n\nPhoto: Lockly\n\n1. Sleeker, Design-Forward Security\n\nThough door knobs with smart locks have added numerical or touchscreen keypads, they still look relatively similar to traditional handles. As technology advances, however, we see companies focusing on more sleek, modern designs that not only incorporate additional features but also reimagine the standard design of smart handles.\n\nLockly Styla\n\nLoved by DIYers and professional builders alike, Lockly is leading the way in creating new looks and enhanced functionality with the Styla. This combination front door handle, smart deadbolt, and video doorbell fits into a cylindrical modern door pull most easily imaginable for high-end residential applications. And it fits a lot in a skinny profile. The video component has a motion sensor, a 2K camera with color night vision, and two-way audio. The smart lock works via a 3D fingerprint sensor, a PIN Genie pad with a randomizable keypad, an RFID reader with programmable fobs, and a traditional keyhole.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough its aesthetics push the envelope enough that they may take some getting used to, we think this and other innovative designs will continue to become more common. This all-in-one handle, lock, and video doorbell comes in matte black, gray, and gold and is battery-powered for easy installation and rechargeable via USB. The Styla also comes with Lockly\u2019s new Wi-Fi hub that privately stores recorded videos and audibly chimes rather than pinging your phone. Stay tuned for when the Lockly Styla becomes available later this year.\n\nPhoto: Schlage\n\n2. Better Sensors\n\nWhile most of us have seen smart locks with numeric buttons or touchscreen keypads, some recently released products indicate better and much harder-to-fool technology is on the way. Though we\u2019re only highlighting two popular CES products here, we predict many brands will be increasing their focus on lock sensors for home security soon.\n\nTCL Smart Lock D1 Pro\n\nThe TCL Smart Lock D1 Pro requires something much more unique than a four-digit code to unlock it: your palm. Though the D1 Pro was launched this past October, CES attendees couldn\u2019t help but flock to see its revolutionary operation. Among its seven unlocking methods, the most interesting by far is its use of AI technology to read and recognize the layout of veins in your palm. Like many other smart locks, it also works via keypad, app, cards, period passwords, standard keys, and voice assist via Google Home and Amazon Alexa. The lock features a 7,800mAh rechargeable battery and durable IP54 weather-resistant construction.\n\nGet the TCL D1 smart lock at Amazon for $179.99.\n\nSchlage Sense Pro\n\nAnother reputable leader in the home security market, Schlage introduced its new Sense Pro Smart Deadbolt at this year\u2019s CES. In addition to a standard touchscreen keypad for code entry, the smart deadbolt uses Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology paired with select personal devices of your choosing to enable hands-free and tap-to-unlock access. Connected to your smart home network, the lock can automatically calculate your speed and trajectory as you approach and unlatch on its own. The Sense Pro is expected to come out later this year.\n\nPhoto: Switchbot\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Increased Front Door Visibility\n\nWith video doorbells showing up next to more front doors every day, it\u2019s relatively standard to be able to check your phone when you hear a chime alerting you to a visitor. Still, it\u2019s not always the most convenient if you\u2019re on a call to see if there\u2019s cause for attention or alarm. Some households may include members without smartphones who can\u2019t access an app-only display. Two products that showed up at CES remedied this issue by integrating their own displays, hardwiring optional.\n\nSwitchBot Video Doorbell\n\nThe SwitchBot Video Doorbell combines a traditional-looking video doorbell with a 4.3-inch smart display screen you can sit on a surface or mount to the wall. The screen delivers live videos, notifies you if anyone arrives, lets you talk to visitors while keeping your door closed, and features 512GB of local storage.\n\nThe unit can be either wired or battery-powered, and SwitchBot will also offer a solar panel to ensure continuous operation. The 2K resolution camera has a 165-degree field of view and color night vision to help you identify visitors no matter the time of day. At the time of publication, no specifics on the SwitchBot Video Doorbell launch date have been announced yet.\n\nLockly Vision Prestige\n\nIn a similar push to enable front door visibility without relying on phones, Lockly will release its Vision Prestige smart lock later this year. Rather than casting video to a separate screen like the SwitchBot Video Doorbell, this lock has a display on its interior housing. It uses presence detection powered by bit radar and a 2K resolution camera with facial recognition to clock when a person is at the door, and the screen lights up when you touch it so you can identify that individual from the inside. It even boasts an intercom, like most video doorbell cameras, so that you can have a conversation through your front door.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Vision Prestige offers a few different means of securing the home, too: keyed entry, fingerprint recognition, and a patented pin entry. You can switch from a traditional touchscreen keypad to Lockly\u2019s PIN Genie, which places digits in random locations, guaranteeing safe entry into your home without revealing your code to prying eyes. We expect the Prestige\u2014an upgrade to the current Lockly Vision\u2014to drop near the end of the year.\n\nPhoto: Hyve\n\n4. Smarter Ways To Secure Deliveries\n\nWhile package delivery boxes and locking mailboxes aren\u2019t a totally new concept, more options have hit the market with smart features like remote locking and unlocking via app and automated video recording. And since package theft is a problem almost everyone has experienced, seen, or heard about, we predict package lockboxes with additional security features will continue to roll out.\n\nHyve Smart Home Delivery Pod\n\nThe Hyve smart home delivery pod may look somewhat similar to a standard front porch delivery box. Like other smart delivery boxes, users can lock and unlock the Hyve pod via an app and send unique codes to drivers, family members, and friends. But that\u2019s far from all this model offers. The box sounds a siren and sends a tamper alert to your phone if it detects anyone is attempting to access it without authorization. It also features a carbon-fiber tether to secure the entire unit to a column or railing, preventing would-be thieves from stealing the entire box. There\u2019s a window on top to allow drivers to take delivery confirmation photos, and Hyve is even compatible with package pickup software to help make arranging returns easier. You can join the waitlist for the smart package pod, expected to start shipping in June."

Each look combines the simplicity and practicality you\u2019re looking for, with stylish results.\n\n\n\n1. Poplin That Pops\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nIf your dress code is casual, it\u2019s the perfect excuse to experiment with color in your work wardrobe. A poplin shirt in pastel pink still reads office-appropriate, yet offers a fun twist that doesn\u2019t feel too restrictive. When paired with dark denim trousers, the look is unstoppable. We recommend accessorizing with a chunky belt and reliable Chelsea boots to keep things fresh and modern, while remaining extremely comfortable.\n\n2. Smart Separates\n\nClaudio Lavenia // Getty Images\n\nYou can still mix and match core office pieces into your wardrobe, such as button-downs and trouser pants, but keep the styling from feeling too buttoned up. Forget the matching suit jacket in this case, and pair these everyday essentials with modern accessories, such as a roomy, leather tote bag in a cool cream tone and a low-heeled leather boot, for a polished, yet relaxed approach to your office look.\n\n3. Cropped Capris\n\nChristian Vierig // Getty Images\n\nWhen it\u2019s warm outside, you can try the trend-forward, capri pant styled with a timeless blazer and button-down. It will give the look an extra nonchalant feel. Keep accessories classic, just like the rest of the outfit, with a sleek slingback and coordinating handbag. It\u2019s a fresh way to do tailoring for the modern day.\n\n4. Boardroom Basics\u2014Remixed\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s true, a blazer and silk button-down shirt have the makings of a corporate closet, but that is why we are encouraging a little remix. By wearing these work wardrobe must-haves with cool, straight jeans and \u201cDad\u201d sneakers, these foundations are made to feel a little more relaxed. You will still look professional, just with a little, street style flair.\n\n5. Luxe Leather\n\nChristian Vierig // Getty Images\n\nA casual workplace offers the opportunity to experiment with texture. A leather shacket (or faux version) is a great way to reinvent the traditional, work shirt. It will become the focal point to build your whole outfit around. Style it with wide-leg trousers, pointy shoes (flats are a must), and an east-west handbag all in a bright white hue.\n\n6. Retro Feels\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nA quirky shirt with a retro nod can lend a bit of fun to your office attire. Whether you go for a color-blocked, western-style version or an oversized bowler, keep things grounded by pairing it with neutral mainstays such as a leather midi skirt, pointed flat, and structured handbag, all in black. The look is cute, casual, yet still completely appropriate for an office setting that is on the laid-back side.\n\n7. Silky Suiting\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nIf you want to go the suiting route, make it a silk one. It\u2019s a little less formal than more structured fabrics, such as wool or cotton, and extra comfortable to wear all day long. This set feels just like your favorite pajama set. Layer a white T-shirt underneath to keep things from feeling too proper, and pair it with leather Mary Jane flat shoes (or white sneakers!).\n\n8. To the Maxi\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nWearing a one-and-done maxi dress is the easiest way to get you out the door in style. A sweater dress is the best solution for when you want to stay comfortable and warm. Keeping with the casual theme, minimalist accessories should be your go-to. We love the simplicity of a kitten heel shoe, gold chain necklace, and mini designer bag.\n\n9. Espresso Dreams\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nA cardigan can be your best friend in the colder months, but how do you keep it from looking too casual? The answer is simple: pair it with an elegant maxi skirt. In the winter, we love a wool fabrication; when it\u2019s warmer, a denim version. Style it with kitten heels and a shoulder bag, all in similar espresso tones."

All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."

            "article_content": "Good Market, developed by fintech experts from M2 Exchange and Freetrade, unveils a revolutionary trading platform that merges AI-powered automation with human-centric design. The platform is currently undergoing closed beta testing with a select group of 500+ traders, with a mission to substantially reduce emotional trading errors\u2014a key contributor to the widely reported 90-95% failure rate among retail traders.\n\nBy simplifying complex trading workflows with systematic execution and automated risk management, Good Market tackles the most common pitfalls that lead to trading losses.\n\n\u201cCurrent trading platforms are part of the problem, not the solution,\u201d says Good Market\u2019s development team. \u201cWhile Binance, Coinbase, and other exchanges focus on transaction volume, they\u2019ve neglected the fundamental issue: traders lack systematic execution tools that prevent emotional trading and enforce disciplined strategies.\u201d\n\nDemo: Good Market Platform\n\nGood Market\u2019s Smart Assist Intelligence\u2122 addresses this crisis by automating trade execution and risk management. With the platform, traders can configure over 300 parameters, including technical indicators and entry/exit conditions, without needing to write any code. This systematic approach helps mitigate the psychological biases that often affect manual trading of popular tokens like Polygon (MATIC), Chainlink (LINK), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nCore Platform Features:\n\nAI-assisted analysis with semi-automated or fully automated execution\n\nAI-prompted strategy builder with 300+ parameters (no coding required)\n\nAutomated position sizing and risk management controls\n\nCommunity marketplace for verified trading strategies\n\nIntegrated technical and fundamental analysis\n\nGetting $GOOD\n\nThe platform\u2019s native token, $GOOD, offers tangible benefits, including up to a 20% reduction in trading fees and access to premium features. Phase 1 of the initial token sale begins at $0.025, with 4 million tokens available before moving to $0.05 in Phase 2.\n\nEarly Investor Benefits:\n\nBeta platform access\n\nInvitation to London investor meetup\n\nFounder-tier platform status\n\nPremium features for holders of 10,000+ tokens\n\nInput on platform development\n\nAbout Good Market\n\nThe Good Market team combines extensive expertise in both cryptocurrency trading and traditional finance, with key players from M2 Exchange, who previously managed over $2B in trading volume, and product leaders from Freetrade. Development of the platform commenced in February 2024, leveraging years of experience tackling retail trading challenges. The platform is expected to enter public beta in Q1 2025. Early investors can join at www.goodmarket.ai.\n\nNote: Trading cryptocurrency and other assets involves a significant risk of loss. While Good Market offers tools for systematic trading, it does not guarantee trading profits. Popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others are highly volatile and should be traded with caution.\n\nConnecting with Good Market:\n\nMedia Contact:\n\ninfo@goodmarket.ai\n\nwww.goodmarket.ai\n\nContact:\n\nMr. Chike Chiejine\n\nGood Market\n\ninfo@goodmarkt.co"

Learn More.\n\nOpenAI is doubling down on its vision for AI in the U.S., unveiling its economic blueprint, \u201cAI in America.\u201d This document outlines strategies to spur AI development, regulate the technology, and maintain America\u2019s edge over global competitors like China. The release comes as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman strengthens ties with the incoming Trump administration, signaling a pivotal moment for AI policy.\n\n\u201cWe believe America needs to act now to maximize AI\u2019s possibilities while minimizing its harms,\u201d OpenAI head of global policy Chris Lehane writes in the blueprint, which highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize sectors like medicine, education, and finance while emphasizing the need for responsible development.\n\nKey Proposals in OpenAI\u2019s Economic Blueprint\n\nThe 15-page OpenAI blueprint offers the following recommendations for advancing AI in America:\n\nIncreased Investment in Infrastructure: The company urges significant public and private funding for advanced computing centers essential for AI tools and systems.\n\nThe company urges significant public and private funding for advanced computing centers essential for AI tools and systems. International Collaboration: OpenAI advocates for partnerships with countries in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, to attract investment and prevent funds from flowing to China.\n\nOpenAI advocates for partnerships with countries in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, to attract investment and prevent funds from flowing to China.

Balancing Growth With Safety: The company highlights the importance of security measures while ensuring the equitable distribution of AI benefits.\n\nThe timing of this initiative is no coincidence. In December, Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s CEO, donated $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural fund. This move signals a calculated effort to strengthen ties with the incoming administration and influence its AI strategy.\n\nThe Stakes for AI Development in America\n\nThe competition to lead in AI is fierce. OpenAI\u2019s rivals, including xAI\u2014led by Elon Musk, an ally of incoming president Trump\u2014are scaling up investments in computing infrastructure. With the stakes so high, OpenAI\u2019s blueprint warns that delays in U.S. policy could redirect critical foreign investments to China.\n\nLehane framed the geopolitical challenge succinctly: \u201cAre those countries going to be building on U.S. rails or on CCP rails?\u201d The implications extend beyond economics, touching on national security and global AI dominance.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe economic blueprint represents OpenAI\u2019s effort to shape the Trump administration\u2019s approach to AI. With a focus on collaboration and innovation, OpenAI plans to host an event on January 30 to demonstrate its latest technology and engage with policymakers. This push underscores the critical role AI plays in America\u2019s economic and strategic future. While the debate over AI regulations continues, OpenAI\u2019s proposals aim to secure the U.S.\u2019s leadership in this transformative field, ensuring both growth and safety.\n\nLearn how to invest in AI to stay ahead of the curve and make the most out of AI opportunities offered by the likes of OpenAI\u2019s blueprint."

That\u2019s how synonymous the search engine of the US tech giant has become with looking something up online, and this is reflected in Google\u2019s market share. Over 90% of online searches in the last decade were conducted on Google Search, but a surprising trend change suggests that the balance of power might just be starting to shift.\n\nAs reported by Search Engine Land, statistics from Statcounter show that Google\u2019s global search market share dropped below 90% for each of the last three months. Specifically, it was 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.73% in December.\n\nOver 89% is still a commanding grip on the market, but what\u2019s most interesting about this development is that it\u2019s the first time Google has failed to hold a 90% market share in a three-month period since the first quarter of 2015 \u2014 almost exactly 10 years earlier.\n\nWhile you might assume that ChatGPT snaffled up some of Google\u2019s custom, the statistics indicate that the traditional search engine competitors benefited most from this trend change. The information is limited, but it appears that Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo! all got a slight boost. Bing was second in terms of market share in December, albeit with just under 4% of online searches.\n\nA potential shift in customer focus wouldn\u2019t be great news for Google, although there could be a silver lining. The firm remains embroiled in a long-running and high-profile antitrust case, with the Department of Justice accusing Google of monopolistic behavior. Part of Google\u2019s defense has been to point out that users have a choice and are free to exercise it. These statistics could add alittle extra weight to that argument.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

            "article_content": "A humungous beast of an animal was discovered in the Amazon rainforest in early 2024, leaving the explorer that found it in awe.\n\nDescribed as being 'as thick as a car tire', the creature was discovered by scientist Professor Freek Vonk among others, who revealed that the animal weighed over 200 kilograms.\n\nAs seen in the viral video, the creature is actually the largest snake in the world, and it was found in the Amazon rainforest (no shock there).\n\nAdvert\n\nIf you're wondering exactly how big it is, look no further:\n\nThe colossal snake wowed thousands on social media, after the professor shared his jaw-dropping discovery with his Instagram followers.\n\nProfessor Vonk highlighted during the video that it was one of the largest snakes he'd ever seen in his life, describing it as 'massive' and a 'monster'.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe also claimed that the new species means that the largest snake species in the world does not only have one variation.\n\nThe scientist explained: \u201cTogether with 14 other scientists from nine countries I have described a NEW snake species from the Amazon today. And not just one. A massive snake!\n\n\"We\u2019ve discovered that the largest snake species in the world, the green anaconda - as we all know it from the movies and all the stories about giant snakes - actually consists of two different species!\n\n\u201cThe green anacondas that occur in the northern part of their range in South America (including Venezuela, Suriname, and French Guyana) turn out to be a completely different species!\n\nAdvert\n\n\"Even though they look almost identical to the eye, the genetic difference between the two is 5.5%, and that is huge.\n\n\"To put this in perspective: humans and chimps are genetically different only about 2% from each other.\u201d\n\nThe professor couldn't believe that the discovered species was part of the largest in the world (Instagram/@freekvonk)\n\nVonk continued: \u201cThe biggest anaconda I've ever seen can be seen in the video, as thick as a car tire, eight meters long and over 200 kg heavy - with a head as big as my head. From total awe and admiration a 'monster'!\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve discovered a new species before, but that was a small snake from Australia. Now it's about a mythical and legendary animal!\n\n\"Definitely one of the highlights of my scientific career. Also because this snake can be found in the Amazon, a place that feels like home to me.\u201d\n\nThe Dutch Professor, who is also a TV presenter, used the discovery to highlight the impact of climate change on the area that it was found, saying that it was \u2018heavily under pressure from climate change and the ever-lasting deforestation of primary rainforest\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u201cAlready over a fifth of the Amazon has disappeared, that's more than 30x the area of the Netherlands.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThe survival of these iconic giant snakes is inseparable to protecting their natural habitat. This study highlights how efficient we need to be on our largest tropical rainforest in the world.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Descendants of Jack the Ripper's victims have demanded an inquest following the discovery of new DNA evidence which could finally unmask the sadistic killer.\n\nThe case of Jack the Ripper is one of the most infamous and enduring cases in British crime history, seeing at least five women - Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly - brutally murdered in East London between 1888 and 1891.\n\nDespite numerous theories cropping up over the years, Jack's true identity has never been uncovered. However, new evidence could finally solve the case once and for all.\n\nAdvert\n\nRead More: Man who claims to have identified Jack the Ripper explains why he was never caught\n\nA depiction of what Jack the Ripper could have looked like (Russell Edwards)\n\nThe supposed breakthrough came after author Russell Edwards purchased a shawl found at the scene of Eddowes' murder containing blood and semen stains and put the item through DNA testing, but this process has since been disputed by scientists.\n\nEdwards was then able to find a DNA match to a descendant of Eddowes, as well as claiming he'd used the semen to find a distant match for a relative of barber Aaron Kosminski, one of the most prominent Ripper suspects.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe has since published the findings from his investigation in his book Naming Jack the Ripper: The Definitive Reveal, which outlines his arguments for Kosminski being the killer's true identity.\n\nKosminski was a Polish barber who emigrated to London in the 1880s and had been named as a suspect at the time but was never arrested due to lack of evidence. He would later die at Leavesden Hospital (then an asylum) in 1919.\n\nAccording to MailOnline, the latest update in the case has seen Edwards hire a legal team to press for an inquest into the case, which is backed by the descendant of Kosminski and Karen Miller, the three-times great-granddaughter of Eddowes.\n\nKaren Miller, a descendant of Ripper victim Catherine Eddowes (North News & Pictures)\n\nAdvert\n\nExplaining her reasons for backing the calls for an inquest, Miller said she wanted to see justice for the five women.\n\n\"What about the real name of the person who did this? Having the real person legally named in a court which can consider all the evidence would be a form of justice for the victims,\" she said.\n\n\"We have got the proof, now we need this inquest to legally name the killer.\n\n\"It would mean a lot to me, to my family, to a lot of people to finally have this crime solved.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThe sentiment is shared by Sue Parlour, whose husband is distantly related to Nichols and Amanda Poulos, the three-times great-niece of Kosminski.\n\n\"A second inquest is the only way of confirming what happened,\" Edwards added.\n\n\"As we now have identified the true murderer with a wealth of evidence putting the man we named as the Ripper in the frame, we want justice to be served.\""

            "article_content": "Last month, on the night of Dec. 7, multiple pilots saw lights in the sky over the Willamette Valley.\n\nAs several outlets reported, an audio recording of air traffic control that went viral features alarm over the lights\u2019 strange movements among pilots of two commercial airliners, United Flight 1596 and Horizon Air Flight 2207, the latter of which had a pilot who reported having seen the same phenomenon \u201ca few times over the last month in the same area\u201d near Eugene.\n\nWhatever they were seeing, it wasn\u2019t showing up on air traffic control\u2019s radar. It was, however, appearing on the crash avoidance system of a small Life Flight plane, Medevac 1LF, heading toward North Bend. Its pilot, Joe Buley, gave the most detailed description:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one way up high and one about at my altitude. Moving in\u2026like a corkscrew pattern. Moving at\u2026extreme speeds... It\u2019s a red circular shape and it keeps zipping out towards the ocean and then coming back in, about 20 miles or closer to us and then zips back out of the ocean.\u201d\n\nThe response from air traffic control: \u201cYou are cleared to maneuver as necessary\u2014a left or right to avoid the UFO out there.\u201d\n\nThis incident was not, by any stretch of the imagination, the first time anybody\u2019s reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. This isn\u2019t even the first time that a United Airlines flight has reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. The region has been an epicenter of postwar UFO sightings, with more people having reported sightings in Portland and Seattle than in any other metro area in the United States since 2000. (The U.S. government now designates such sightings as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d or UAPs.)\n\nIt was here that on June 24, 1947, an amateur pilot named Kenneth Arnold set off a national frenzy after he reported seeing \u201cnine saucerlike aircraft flying in formation\u201d above Southwest Washington while flying from Chehalis to Yakima. (Thus, like \u201cgrunge\u201d and \u201cvegan strip club,\u201d \u201cflying saucer\u201d became a product of the Pacific Northwest.) Ten days later, the crew of United Flight 105 reported a nearly identical experience while flying from Boise to Pendleton.\n\nIn 1950, an Oregon couple named Paul and Evelyn Trent took two pictures on their Kodak of a \u201cdisc-shaped object\u201d that supposedly hovered above their farm outside of McMinnville without emitting any sound. The pictures ended up in Life magazine and remain a point of contention between UFO skeptics and believers.\n\nIn the 75 years since, there\u2019ve been thousands of reported sightings across the Pacific Northwest. Regardless of personal opinions of such things, it\u2019s undeniable that during this time UFOs and little green men have embedded themselves into the cultural fabric of the region, another stitch alongside New Age crystal healers, Bigfoot true believers, and whatever it is that draws people to a full-size replica of Stonehenge on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge. McMinnville and Chehalis both now hold annual UFO festivals; the Royal Canadian Mint issues a coin commemorating a 1970 sighting in British Columbia.\n\nWhat happened last month over the valley, though, was different from anything else that\u2019s come before. The Dec. 7 incident represented legitimate documentation of multiple professional pilots seeing the same things and having the same reaction to them. In that audio recording, an unnamed pilot aboard Horizon Air Flight 2207 can be heard refuting what\u2019s become the standard explanation for what they saw\u2014satellites. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not Starlink, I promise,\u201d he says. \u201cI know what that looks like.\u201d Buley, the pilot of Medevac 1LF, also doubts this explanation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen satellites\u2026stuff like that. This was definitely different,\u201d he told KEZI-TV. (WW reached out to Life Flight Network but was told that Buley and the rest of his crew have declined to speak further on the matter.)\n\nIt\u2019s all very strange. Perhaps the UFO believers are right after all. If they are, and this is a real thing, then the greatest story of all time has been playing out above our backyard. Or maybe it\u2019s nothing at all."

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."
