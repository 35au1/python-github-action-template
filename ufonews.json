Lab 9 Films has revealed an official trailer for yet another new documentary about UFOs \u2013 this one called The Program. Ever since the US government started actually talking openly about UFOs, now officially known as UAP (\"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena\") sightings, Ufologists have been going crazy. They've gone beyond conspiracy drifting into full-on \"it has to be true!\" irrefutable belief. Of course. The Program is yet another new UFOs / aliens-are-real film from filmmaker James Fox, who also made The Phenomenon and Moment of Contact in the years before. Featuring narration by Peter Coyote (Bitter Moon, E.T.). The doc includes \"extensive interviews with insiders, experts and politicians. Christopher Mellon, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, and Stanford University's Dr. Gary Nolan, [are] among those who appear in the doc.\" It's another doc about extraterrestrials that now wants to dig into the question: is there a big government program keeping the truth a secret? (Is it called The X-Files?) What do you believe?\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for James Fox's UFO doc The Program, direct from YouTube:\n\nThis highly anticipated follow-up to director James Fox's other blockbuster UFO documentary films, The Phenomenon (2020) and Moment of Contact (2022), The Program explores the unprecedented bipartisan Congressional effort to uncover what US intelligence agencies really know about UFOs, now referred to as UAP. The first two public hearings in over half a century included testimony under oath from military & intelligence officers with jaw-dropping allegations of a clandestine program to analyze materials and non-human biologics. Through candid interviews with high-ranking insiders, elected officials, physicists, intelligence officers, and military whistleblowers, The Program goes behind the scenes to leave even the staunchest skeptics astounded by the assertions from a growing chorus of insiders that we are not alone. The Program is directed by ufologist / filmmaker James Fox, director of the other doc films I Know What I Saw, The Phenomenon, and Moment of Contact previously. Produced by James Fox & Lance Mungia. Lab 9 Films releases Fox's doc The Program in select US theaters + on VOD to watch later in 2024. Stay tuned."

In it he outlines a theory that was gathering momentum that UFOs harness anti-gravity to circumvent the laws of physics.\n\nIn the memoir Mr Elizondo discusses what his team called a \"bubble\" that would be around the UFO. This bubble would potentially make it so that Earth's gravity would not effect it and could explain why many UFOs appear to be able to accelerate away at such speed and force.\n\nHe also said the theory goes, that without any gravity affecting the UFO, there would also be no time dilation taking place, meaning that while time for everyone on Earth would be slowed down by the Earth's gravity, time for anything operating a craft would be considerably faster. He says this would mean anything looking outside a UFO would see all of humanity moving at a fraction of their speed.\n\nImage: CNN) CNN)\n\nMr Elizondo rose to fame in late 2017 in the pages of the New York Times, when he blew the whistle on the US military and intelligence community. He claimed there was \"mismanagement and excessive secrecy\" on the topic of UFOs. In April 2020, the Pentagon officially released three videos that Elizondo had helped leak in 2017.\n\nThey show footage taken by US Navy fighter pilots, who had reportedly witnessed 'unexplained aerial phenomena' - how UFOs are now known. His book contains, among its many incredible revelations, details on a 2016 plan hatched by Mr Elizondo and his military colleagues to catch a UFO in the ocean.\n\nImage: AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHe told NewsNation: \"We're not alone in this universe, and it is a simple fact. The US government has been aware of that fact for decades now. I think if the American public knew just how deep this lie went, that we would have a very significant constitutional crisis on our hands.\""

        "article_content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Future\n\nAs more and more companies scramble to jam artificial intelligence into literally everything, I find myself becoming increasingly desensitized to the prospect of using AI for really anything. I loathe the anti-creative powers of generative AI for text and image creation, and I\u2019m so over products carrying AI branding for no reason (I\u2019m looking at you, Samsung Family Hub AI Vision fridge).\n\nAs a serial gym goer, however, there\u2019s one area of my life where AI has proven indispensable for more than a year, and that\u2019s in powering my workouts. Last year, I was introduced to PUSH, an AI-powered workout app and gym tracker designed to help you build muscle as quickly as possible by taking a scientific approach to workout creation.\n\nGive or take a couple of injuries and some holidays, I\u2019ve used PUSH six days a week, every week, for over a year. I\u2019ve done hundreds of workouts, and in that time I\u2019ve learned more about exercise than all my previous years of experience attending the gym. It\u2019s definitely one of the best fitness apps I\u2019ve ever used.\n\nPUSH is a delight to use, it\u2019s got a great interface that\u2019s very easy to use, rest counters, custom workout plans, and more. Yet more valuable than the joy I\u2019ve had using the app, PUSH has taught me some invaluable lessons about building muscle in the gym I can\u2019t wait to share with you. Here\u2019s everything I\u2019ve learned.\n\nProgressive overload really matters\n\nPUSH workout app\n\nIf you\u2019re new to the gym or building muscle, you might have heard the term \u2018progressive overload\u2019 bandied around. Even as a long-time gym goer, I was familiar with the concept, but until I started using PUSH, I\u2019d never really taken it seriously.\n\nPUSH is hyper-tuned to help you gradually increase the amount of weight you\u2019re lifting over time, a tried and tested vehicle for building muscle. I\u2019d spent years bench pressing maybe 70 or 80kgs (175lbs-ish), occasionally pushing the boat out to 85kgs if I was feeling sprightly.\n\nPUSH has helped me elevate my bench press to a consistent 100kgs for multiple sets of five in less than 12 months. Across the board, all of my movements and lifts have increased in power and weight because PUSH doesn\u2019t let you take your foot off the gas. As soon as you can achieve the desired number of reps at a certain weight, PUSH uses its AI algorithm to calculate your next increment. If you fail a set or can\u2019t see a certain weight through to completion, it\u2019ll automatically calculate a plateau-breaker exercise, usually an increased weight for fewer reps, to help you smash through your next barrier.\n\nWith PUSH in my pocket, I\u2019m no longer guessing weights for workouts, or retreading ground. I\u2019m just making clear consistent progress week-in, week-out.\n\nIt\u2019s time to ditch the Bro Split\n\nPUSH workout app\n\nMost people tend to split their gym program up into body parts. Chest on Monday, back on Tuesday, then legs, shoulders, arms, etc\u2026 in gym circles, this is known as the \u201cBro Split\u201d. If it works for you then that\u2019s fine, but PUSH\u2019s tailor-made program uses AI and peer-reviewed scientific research to calculate a plan that lets you train your entire body in an optimal cycle.\n\n\n\nFor instance, on some days, I train back, legs, arms, and shoulders, all at once. It took some getting used to \u2013 doing lateral pulldowns right after squats isn\u2019t fun \u2013 but by carefully training muscles in a more target way, rather than just blasting chest on a Monday once a week and so on, I\u2019ve noticed a much more consistent and manageable progression in my strength and improved recovery. You can opt for a push, pull, leg split in the PUSH app if you so desire, but I\u2019ve put my faith in the AI algorithm and its unconventional muscle groupings, and I\u2019ll never go back.\n\nRest is important\n\nPUSH workout app\n\nWhile the aforementioned muscle groupings help with longer-term fatigue over the weeks and months, PUSH also comes with a built-in rest timer for use between sets. I probably spent six years in the gym just guessing at how long I was taking between sets, choosing when to start my next exercise based purely on vibes and whether or not I\u2019d finished cruising Instagram.\n\nPUSH\u2019s regimented rest timer, which varies depending on the type of exercise you\u2019re doing, has shown me the importance of training to a precise period of rest. Too little time between sets, and your muscles won\u2019t have recovered, leaving you unable to push as much as you need. Too long, and you won\u2019t be fatiguing your muscles enough to make any progress.\n\nAgain, PUSH uses AI to determine what constitutes an ideal rest time but gives you the final say in how long you take, letting you tweak rest periods slightly based on how you\u2019re feeling. With set rest times between exercises, I\u2019ve massively improved the progress I make in the gym, all while reducing how long I actually spend in the gym.\n\nGrowth takes time\n\nPUSH workout app muscle growth\n\nWe live in a world of instant gratification, but PUSH has helped me understand that growing and building muscle takes time and commitment. Having an app show me my progress week-by-week has been vital in keeping me motivated, even when the results aren\u2019t physically obvious or immediate.\n\nSeeing consistent strength gains each time I return to the gym is a terrific motivator, and has helped me to take my eyes off trying to make big jumps in performance or expecting huge changes in my physique. What\u2019s more, knowing you\u2019re on a steady upward trajectory takes ego lifting and overexerting yourself out of the equation, with measured increases drastically reducing the chances of injury, and of course embarrassment.\n\nInvesting in a program is worth it\n\nPUSH workout app sources and research\n\nI pay \u00a315.99 ($21 / AU$23.49) a month for the privilege of using PUSH. That\u2019s a lot of money for a monthly subscription app, but for me the investment is priceless. I\u2019m convinced that with PUSH I\u2019m getting good value out of the app. It\u2019s well-built, gets regular updates, and most importantly has proven effective for me. However, there\u2019s also an extra kick of motivation in knowing that if I\u2019m paying \u00a316 a month for a workout app, I should probably use it to the full, instead of wasting my money.\n\nIt\u2019s the same tortured logic that says buying a pair of the best running shoes will help you get out an exercise, or that paying for a gym membership is more likely to get you out of the house each January. It might not work for everyone, but the financial commitment I\u2019ve made to this app keeps me coming back for more.\n\nAnd a whole lot more besides\n\nApple Watch training load\n\nPUSH has more to offer. It\u2019s got a great library of exercises that help me plan around a busy gym or lack of equipment. Its plethora of peer-reviewed source material is well presented and makes for an interesting read, and its daily insights tell me which muscles I\u2019m growing and which might be stalling, another fabulous motivator. It\u2019s not a perfect app and it won\u2019t work for everyone, but after 12 months in my pocket, it\u2019s become an indispensable training partner.\n\nYou may also like"

On one popular benchmark test, LiquidAI said its largest and most capable model could equal the performance of Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1-70B model released in July while needing much less computer memory, since it is only about one-sixth the size.\n\nIn a blog post and white paper released on Monday, LiquidAI claimed that its software could generate answers as quickly as competitors while requiring less memory and computing power, thus saving money and consuming less energy.\n\nOne of Boston\u2019s most prominent artificial intelligence startups, LiquidAI , on Monday disclosed how its software works for the first time \u2014 and how it might be able to outperform popular AI apps like ChatGPT. The company is also making the software accessible to anyone over the internet for further testing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve markedly improved quality, cost-effectiveness, and power efficiency compared to current GPT models,\u201d LiquidAI chief executive and cofounder Ramin Hasani said in the blog post. \u201cOur innovative architecture allows us to outperform larger traditional models, providing powerful solutions that are both cost-effective and scalable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiquidAI was founded in March 2023 by Hasani, chief technical officer Mathias Lechner, and chief scientific officer Alexander Amini, with MIT professor Daniela Rus, who runs the university\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\n\nHasani and Lechner studied the brain of a tiny roundworm as inspiration for creating a new kind of computer neural network. Instead of modeling the network on the human brain, which has about 86 billion neurons, they used the roundworm\u2019s brain, which has just 300 neurons.\n\nEssentially, the digital \u201cneurons\u201d in LiquidAI\u2019s model operate in a more flexible way than the \u201cneurons\u201d in large language models. The model can generate text or video or be used for other AI tasks, the company said.\n\nIn the blog post, LiquidAI said it had developed models of varying size and capability, with some able to run on smartphones and others requiring larger servers in a data center. The models were tested against a handful of comparable rivals using a variety of industry benchmarks, where they met or exceeded the performance of competing large language models, the company said. Those claims were not independently verified by the Globe. (LiquidAI did not test its models against OpenAI\u2019s GPT models, which are vastly larger and required hundreds of millions of dollars or more to create.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting on Monday, people can access the models through LiquidAI\u2019s chatbot or try linking their own software via the company\u2019s website and some other cloud services. The company also said customers would be able to run its software on a variety of hardware, including chips from Apple, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Qualcomm.\n\nSo far, LiquidAI has shown success using its software in a few ways but will need to prove it can attack a variety of large-scale challenges, particularly around generating text and more complicated math or coding problems, Usama Fayyad, executive director of the Institute for Experiential Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern, said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done the early breakthrough work and it\u2019s a promising direction,\u201d said Fayyad, who worked on AI and data science in Silicon Valley for decades before joining the university. \u201cNow the question is ... can they show it applying to many tasks, reliably under many conditions.\u201d\n\nLast December, LiquidAI raised $37.5 million in seed funding from high-profile investors led by Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca and San Francisco venture capital firm OSS Capital. The company is rumored to be raising considerably more for its next funding round.\n\nThe company is planning a public demonstration of its software on Oct. 23 at MIT\u2019s Kresge Auditorium.\n\nAaron Pressman can be reached at aaron.pressman@globe.com.

        "article_content": "Minneapolis is home to countless reports of ghosts, ghouls, spirits, specters, phantoms and paranormal activity.\n\nFrom the scornful spirits skulking around a historic skyscraper to the clueless ghost of a clumsy barmaid, a plethora of supposed spirits have been reported in the community. Skeptics and believers alike have come up with inconclusive evidence of these hauntings, leaving the truth behind these ghastly stories a mystery.\n\nOne of the most famous haunted places in the mill city is Foshay Tower, said to be haunted by Ponzi scheme pioneer Wilbur Foshay. Legend has it that Foshay jumped off of his namesake tower. In reality, Foshay died of a stroke in a nearby nursing home in 1957.\n\n\u201cDangerous\u201d Linda Lee, local ghost tour guide and regional vice president of American Ghost Walks, said she believes she knows whose spirit is actually haunting the historic building downtown. Lee said the Foshay Tower is haunted by the ghosts of Mrs. Genevieve Clark and her family.\n\nThe sole woman juror on Foshay\u2019s fraud trial, Clark was also the sole holdout on the jury, ultimately leading to a mistrial. It was later discovered that Clark and her husband had financial dealings with Foshay, and she was charged with contempt of court for not disclosing her relationship with him during the trial.\n\nClark, her husband and two sons died of carbon monoxide poisoning in an apparent suicide in 1933. Lee said she believes Clark may be haunting the Foshay Tower because of the unresolved emotional conflict between her and the utility magnate.\n\nLee said she has been preparing and guiding ghost tours in Minnesota for almost ten years, occasionally assisted by a spirit named Alice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s storytelling, it\u2019s history, it\u2019s spirituality,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThis was made for me.\u201d\n\nA few blocks away from the downtown stops of Lee\u2019s ghost tour is the historic Black Forest Inn in Uptown, where many claim to have seen or felt the presence of strange supernatural spirits.\n\nGina Christ, co-owner of the family-owned haunt, said she began to believe the ghost stories because so many of the restaurant\u2019s employees reported paranormal activity in the building, especially in the basement.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s haunted because of the consensus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a level of universality that I find really compelling.\u201d\n\nReports of hauntings eventually led Christ to invite the Twin Cities Paranormal Society to investigate the Inn\u2019s supposed haunting. The Twin Cities Paranormal Society claimed to have recorded a disembodied voice saying \u201cHelp me\u201d during an overnight investigation of the restaurant, according to member Thomas Troupe.\n\nTroupe said investigators contacted the spirit of a former maintenance worker named Dale at a workbench in the basement of the restaurant. Using an array of recording devices and an electromagnetic frequency measuring device, he said investigators were able to ask the spirit questions about their life and afterlife.\n\n\u201cThe conversation was pretty one-sided,\u201d Troupe said.\n\nIn 2013, the Twin Cities Paranormal Society investigated another of Minneapolis\u2019 haunted landmarks, the nearby Turnblad Mansion, home to the American Swedish Institute. Reports of hauntings at the mansion date all the way back to 1921, said Andrea Justus, volunteer and interpretive services coordinator of the Institute.\n\nJustus leads flashlight tours of the mansion in the days before Halloween, giving guests a history lesson about both the mansion and the reported hauntings. However, Justus said she is still unsure whether she believes in ghosts.\n\n\u201cI leave it up to people to come to their own conclusions,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no super conclusive evidence.\u201d\n\nDespite his belief in the existence of ghosts, Troupe said he understands doubts about the validity of evidence produced in paranormal investigations.\n\nLee said she also understands the skepticism because most people who have not experienced anything paranormal have difficulty understanding the supernatural.\n\n\u201cDo we have definitive, absolute proof? No,\u201d Troupe said. \u201cBut we have weird things we can\u2019t explain.\u201d\n\nPeter Harle, a University of Minnesota professor and folklore enthusiast, said believing in ghosts can be both comforting and exciting. Ghost stories are a way for people to understand something operating differently from reality, he said.\n\nHarle said ghost stories take us out of our own existence. Investigating suspected supernatural synchronicities is a way for people to put themselves in the story, he added.\n\n\u201cWe relate to our ghosts in curious ways,\u201d Harle said."

One local vendor at the event was Mandrake and Hare Emporium, run by Norman Barton and Audrey Protherow. According to Protherow, the idea behind the Mandrake and Hare Emporium is to bring dark and delicious living to Marietta. She said the emporium currently lacks a storefront but they are planning to open a booth in Smith and Company Vintage on Colegate Drive in the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cI like pretty things, I like luxurious things and I like atmospheric and moody things. I\u2019ve been trying to curate what I like my vision of the world to be and hope by doing that I find people that also like that kind of thing,\u201d said Protherow, \u201cI\u2019m hoping to build a community from this store \u2026 we like people who like history (and) vintage style not vintage values.\u201d\n\nMandrake and Hare Emporium sells spices, fragrances, art, clothing and a myriad of other tchotchkes, a small object that is decorative rather than strictly functional, that cater to the eerie and Victorian aesthetics. For more information you can visit their website at: www.mandrakeandhare.com.\n\nThere were also presentations and interactive workshops from paranormal experts with sessions on true crime.\n\nTrue crime sessions included: Theresa\u2019s Haunted History of the Tri-state, The Hext Baby Jules Nolan and Paranormal Nightmare TV: The Fourman Brothers. Theresa Racer from Spectral Research Investigations gave a session on haunted objects and spoke on her experience as a child where she moved into what she called a haunted house.\n\n\u201cThis house was a fairly new house \u2026 but we bought it from my stepfather\u2019s mother, and my stepfather\u2019s father had passed away in the backyard,\u201d said Racer, \u201cAbout as soon as we moved in there is when stuff started happening \u2026 my stepfather constantly saw his father standing in the hallway, we would see someone that looked like our local newscaster walk down the hallway \u2026 we would have electrical disturbances, cabinets would come open.\u201d\n\nAlso attending the expo were paranormal investigators, UFOlogists, cryptozoologists and psychics. Supernatural Expeditions is an episodic paranormal group based out of Bridgeport, Ohio. They post their videos on YouTube and travel as far as they can, according to investigator Shane Bennington.\n\n\u201cNorth, South, East, West; clear to Iowa, clear to Rhode Island, clear to Cleveland,\u201d said Bennington.\n\nBennington said out of his travels his three favorite investigations were the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, W.Va., the Sallie House in Atchinson, KS and the Farrar Schoolhouse in Polk County, IA. Bennington stated that the one that frightened him the most, but was also his favorite of the three, was the Sallie House.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to get on this topic that much,\u201d said Bennington, \u201cIt felt like someone was \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say possessing, but my vibe was going away \u2026 it was agitating me, it turned really bad.\u201d Supernatural Expeditions can be found on YouTube, Facebook and TikTok under Supernatural Expeditions.\n\nHidden Marietta was originally founded in 2008 with a handful of street-tours about history with some spooky stories intertwined but grew into a much larger company according to co-owner Karita Miller. She said Hidden Marietta has a shop located in the Anchorage Mansion dedicated to spooky history. They are currently partnering with the Washington County Historical Society to restore the Anchorage Mansion and a portion of the shop\u2019s proceeds go back into the building, Miller said. She said Hidden Marietta continues to perform street tours, overnights on Blennerhassett Island and the Anchorage Mansion is available to rent for events.\n\n\u201cOur passion is to bring history to everybody,\u201d said Miller, \u201cIt\u2019s more fun when you add in those true crime stories or those spooky stories.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Hidden Marietta check out their website at www.hiddenmarietta.com."

        "source": "Psychology Today",
        "article_content": "Source: GrumpyBeere/Pixabay\n\nBelief in the paranormal continues to enjoy a central place in popular culture. Social scientists classify something as \"paranormal\" when it runs counter to both a scientific understanding of the world and mainstream religious doctrine (Bader et al., 2010). It can include a wide range of entities, events, or abilities like psychic abilities, fairies, or the alleged influence of the stars on human affairs.\n\nPolls frequently find that belief in paranormal phenomena is not at all unusual. For example, one poll found that 36 percent of Americans reported that they believe in ghosts while over a fifth believed in witchcraft or magic spells (Ipsos, 2021).\n\nThis widespread belief is all the more interesting considering there is no hard evidence to support the existence of anything paranormal (see Markovsky, 2023 for a review). Instead, research finds that anomalous claims are usually based on very non-paranormal things like subjective feelings, quirky experiences, technical glitches in recording devices, or misperceptions (Radford, 2010). So why do some people interpret this sort of phenomenon as paranormal while others do not?\n\nPerception and Categorization\n\nMany researchers have been interested in precisely this question. One possible explanation has to do with how different people tend to perceive and categorize things.\n\nFrom a very early age, children acquire \"core knowledge\" about the world around them (Wellman and Gelman, 1998). Through experience, they learn that there are different classes or categories of things that have different properties and how to distinguish between them.\n\nFor instance, there are physical things that are different from mental things and inanimate things that are different from animate. A thought or feeling does not have shape or size, but physical objects do. Similarly, inanimate things don\u2019t move of their own volition and don\u2019t make decisions, but animate ones do.\n\nSince this is a fundamental aspect of developmental psychology, it has been proposed that there could be a link between one\u2019s mastery of core knowledge and their tendency to believe in things\u2014like the paranormal\u2014that run counter to the understanding of the world that this formative knowledge should provide. In particular, the extent to which a given person is prone to \"ontological confusion\" could explain many such beliefs (Lindeman and Aarnio, 2007).\n\nIn other words, their tendency to mistake one category of thing or its properties for another type. This results in a lack of conceptual clarity where, for example, they might tend to mistakenly attribute living characteristics to inanimate objects or assign physical properties to mental things.\n\nThis misperception fits well with many of the experiences paranormal believers interpret as supernatural. For example, many accounts of encounters with seemingly otherworldly forces mistake internal feelings as something caused by an external force (Debies-Carl, 2023). A walk in a cemetery at night can be understandably scary, but to mistake that fear as something psychically caused by an entity lurking in that environment is something else entirely. Seeing some sort of agency in bad luck or perceiving consciousness in \"cursed\" objects conceivably also represent examples of ontological confusion.\n\nSource: magwood_photography/Pixabay\n\nSeveral studies over the years have attempted to examine this question. Generally, they find support for the connection between ontological confusion and paranormal beliefs (e.g. Betsch et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2024). However, the results also tend to vary from one study to the next.\n\nFortunately, a new paper published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences provides new insight into this topic (Gallyamova et al., 2024). Rather than simply collecting new data from a new sample of participants to examine the question, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of existing research on the subject. This is a formalized method of inquiry that statistically combines the results of previous research on a specific research question. In doing so, it can locate any deeper patterns that exist between all of this body of work despite the differences between them.\n\nThe synthesis included a total of 25 previous studies, published between 2010 and 2024, that examined the relationship between ontological confusion and belief in the paranormal. In total, these studies included data on 16,129 participants from 11 different countries. This provides a reasonable sample to work with, not only in terms of the total number of people involved, but also due to its cross-cultural representativeness.\n\nThe authors employed statistical methods to check for publication bias that could affect their results\u2014an important concern with any meta-analysis\u2014but they found no evidence of significant bias. This increases confidence in the findings.\n\nWhat the Latest Study Found\n\nThe results indicated that there was considerable diversity in these studies. Specific results varied across them, which can make finding a clear pattern difficult. However, the overall outcome was a consistent pattern: People who express more ontological confusion are more likely to also express belief in the paranormal.\n\nThe fact that the study included a range of nations helps to determine whether any findings were caused by cultural differences or something more fundamental about the human psyche. In this case, despite differences across studies in different countries, the overall pattern persisted.\n\nThis report\u2019s findings are interesting in and of themselves, but they also highlight potential directions for future research. The first has to do with the fact that there was variation in the strength of the relationship between ontological confusion and paranormal belief that could not be accounted for by looking at the variables the authors had access to. From this, it is clear that there are other important factors that play a role but that still need to be identified.\n\nSecond, the results also highlight the need for further cross-cultural research. This is especially true for work that can carefully ensure the validity of measures across different nations and languages.\n\nWhile questions remain, the findings illustrate a fascinating link between cognition and the things we are willing to believe. They also seem to indicate that culture or some other social factors could modify this relationship, given the variance in the study. Consequently, further inquiry could lead to new insights into how to improve our critical thinking and, in the process, protect ourselves against beliefs formed on shaky foundations."

She said she frequently conducts spirit galleries and paranormal investigations at SK Pierce Mansion, even before the 2022 renovations on the mansion were completed, and at the Murdock-Whitney House as well. Wells said she services and guides about 5,000 people every year.\n\n\"I just really enjoy bringing messages of hope to people and I'm very comfortable with it,\" she said. \"Although there are the spooks and scares of the paranormal, the reality is that the reason why spirits make themselves known at the mansion is because they loved the SK Pierce mansion.\"\n\nThe Wednesday night Spirit Gallery and Mansion Tour at SK Pierce Victorian Mansion is sold out but tickets for the The Haunts & History of The Winchendon Historical Society are still available.\n\nThe Murdock-Whitney house in Winchendon\n\nSearch for ghosts at Winchendon Historical Society\n\nWells said the event at Winchendon Historical Society differs from her SK Pierce Mansion event because instead of connecting and passing over messages to people's dead loved ones, people will get to use equipment to detect any life after death.\n\nTickets for the Saturday night event are $69 per person and an additional $25 is required to participate in a spirit gallery earlier that day. The history and tour of the Murdock-Whitney House and the Isaac Morse House start at 6 p.m., while the spirit gallery starts at 4 p.m.\n\nGreen Mountain Paranormal Investigations, a supernatural investigation group based in Northern Vermont, will help lead the investigation in Winchendon. Wells said both she and the Green Mountain team will bring equipment that people can use to detect hot spots in both houses.\n\n\"I always create a sacred space for people to open themselves up to the idea and I find that it's a wonderful learning experience for people to understand how they connect to the spirit realm,\" she said. \"I prepare people on a spiritual level to be open to spirits if that's what they desire.\"\n\nSupport local historic organizations even if you don't believe\n\nWells said whether you believe it or not, coming to these events with an open mind is important because you never know what you will experience.\n\n\"It's not my job to prove anything to anyone,\" she said. \"I feel that everyone has their own interpretation and their own experiences, so whether someone comes in as a skeptic or a full believer, I am open to giving everyone an equal opportunity to connect with the supernatural realm.\"\n\nWells said honoring old buildings rich in history that exist within the community is one of the biggest reasons she loves hosting paranormal investigation and spirit gallery events at historic houses and organizations.\n\n\"It's fascinating that these buildings still exist and they're being preserved, loved and cared for by their community,\" she said. \"These buildings and historical societies need our support financially, so whether it's a paranormal investigation or a baby shower, hosting and attending events is an important part of keeping them in our community.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Psychic coming to Winchendon, SK Pierce Mansion: How to get tickets"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nExcavated in Canada, this Eastern red cedar log turned out to be remarkably well-preserved for its age: 3,775 years old. Credit: Mark Sherwood, University of Maryland\n\nA new study published in the journal Science suggests that an ordinary old log could help refine strategies to tackle climate change.\n\nA team of researchers led by University of Maryland Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Professor Ning Zeng analyzed a 3,775-year-old log and the soil it was excavated from. Their analysis, published on September 27, 2024, revealed that the log had lost less than 5% carbon dioxide from its original state thanks to the low-permeability clay soil that covered it.\n\n\"The wood is nice and solid\u2014you could probably make a piece of furniture out of it,\" Zeng noted.\n\nUnderstanding the unique environmental factors that kept that ancient log in mint condition could help researchers perfect an emerging climate solution known as \"wood vaulting,\" which involves taking wood that is not commercially viable\u2014such as trees destroyed by disease or wildfires, old furniture or unused construction materials\u2014and burying it to stop its decomposition.\n\nTrees naturally sequester carbon dioxide\u2014a potent planet-warming gas\u2014for as long as they live, making tree-planting projects a popular method of mitigating climate change. But on the flip side, when trees die and decompose, that greenhouse gas is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.\n\n\"People tend to think, 'Who doesn't know how to dig a hole and bury some wood?'\" Zeng said. \"But think about how many wooden coffins were buried in human history. How many of them survived? For a timescale of hundreds or thousands of years, we need the right conditions.\"\n\nIn 2013, while conducting a wood vaulting pilot project in Quebec, Canada, Zeng discovered the 3,775-year-old log that became the focus of the study\u2014a chance encounter that for Zeng felt \"kind of miraculous.\" While digging a trench to bury fresh wood, Zeng and other researchers spotted the log about 6.5 feet below the surface.\n\nUniversity of Maryland Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Professor Ning Zeng holds the 3,775-year-old log that is the subject of a new study in Science. Credit: Mark Sherwood, University of Maryland\n\n\"When the excavator pulled a log out of the ground and threw it over to us, the three ecologists that I had invited from McGill University immediately identified it as Eastern red cedar,\" Zeng recalled. \"You could tell how well it was preserved. I remember standing there thinking, 'Wow, here's the evidence that we need.'\"\n\nWhile past studies have analyzed old samples of preserved wood, they tended to overlook the surrounding soil conditions, according to Zeng.\n\n\"There is a lot of geological and archaeological evidence of preserved wood from hundreds to millions of years ago, but the focus of those studies was not 'How can we engineer a wood vault to preserve that wood?'\" Zeng said. \"And the problem with designing a new experiment is that we can't wait 100 years for the results.\"\n\nShortly after the Quebec dig, UMD's collaborators at MAPAQ, a government ministry in Montreal, conducted carbon dating to determine the log's age. Then, in 2021, Distinguished University Professor Liangbing Hu in UMD's Department of Materials Science and Engineering helped Zeng analyze the 3,775-year-old sample's microscopic structure, chemical composition, mechanical strength and density. They then compared those results to that of a freshly cut Eastern red cedar log, which revealed that the older sample had lost very little carbon dioxide.\n\nThe type of soil covering the log was the key reason for its remarkable preservation. The clay soil in that part of Quebec had an especially low permeability, meaning that it prevented or drastically slowed oxygen from reaching the log while also keeping out fungi and insects, the decomposers typically found in soil.\n\nBecause clay soil is common, wood vaulting could become a viable and low-cost option in many parts of the world. As a climate solution, Zeng noted that wood vaulting is best paired with other tactics to slow global warming, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAs he and his colleagues continue to optimize wood vaulting, he looks forward to putting what they've learned into practice to help curb climate change.\n\n\"It's quite an exciting discovery,\" Zeng said of this latest study. \"The urgency of climate change has become such a prominent issue, so there was even more motivation to get this analysis going.\"\n\nMore information: Ning Zeng et al, 3775-year-old wood burial supports \"wood vaulting\" as a durable carbon removal method, Science (2024).

        "article_content": "Texas Science & Natural History Museum, located on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin, saw record attendance in its first full year since rebranding and reopening in September 2023. Formerly known as Texas Memorial Museum, the 85-year-old museum reopened to the public late last September as a vibrant hub for education, exploration and discovery. In the last year, the space welcomed more than 75,000 visitors, hailing from all 50 states and 28 different countries. Nearly 300 school and community groups have toured the museum, and another 9,000 people, beyond the visiting museum-goers, came through the doors for private events, including wedding ceremonies and holiday parties.\n\n\u201cThere has been such an overwhelming and enthusiastic response from visitors in the last year, from Austin locals and from around the world,\u201d said Carolyn Connerat, managing director. \u201cThis museum is a treasure for our community, and it\u2019s a privilege to welcome curious minds of all ages through the doors.\u201d\n\nWith new investments from the University, the College of Natural Sciences and the Texas Legislature, in 2022 and 2023 the museum underwent significant renovations and rebranding to better reflect its mission and offerings. This transformation introduced new exhibits and modernized facilities designed to enhance the visitor experience and educational impact.\n\nThe museum\u2019s updated exhibits continue to showcase the rich geological, paleontological and natural history of Texas, while new displays connect visitors to the natural world, from prehistoric life to the impacts of current research and technology.\n\nIts newest temporary exhibit features a scale model of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, the largest optical telescope in North America. Located at the McDonald Observatory in West Texas, the 80-ton telescope boasts a 10-meter mirror composed of 91 hexagonal segments, making it a powerhouse for astronomical research. Visitors to the exhibit, \u201cBig Eye on Dark Skies: The Hobby-Eberly Telescope,\u201d will learn how this remarkable piece of technology is used to search for planets outside our solar system, look at distant galaxies and even study dark energy. Information about how to participate in a related citizen science project is also part of the exhibit, which is housed on the museum\u2019s third floor.\n\nThe telescope exhibit follows April\u2019s opening of the \u201cParticles of Color\u201d exhibit, which explores the science of sustainable fashion. Located in the museum\u2019s Science Frontiers Gallery, the exhibit focuses on the creation and use of plant-based biodegradable sequins, highlighting garments and accessories designed and made by UT students and faculty, as well as fashion industry professionals.\n\nNext March, the museum plans to open its reimagined hands-on Discovery Center, where visitors can explore real fossil specimens and engage in scientific thinking in an active educational space. Construction has begun on the project.\n\n\u201cThis historic museum\u2019s first year back was a phenomenal success, thanks to the many staff, volunteers, supporters and lawmakers who played a role,\u201d said David Vanden Bout, dean of the College of Natural Sciences. \u201cAlong with leaders across campus, I am excited to join these museum champions in making sure that future exciting offerings reach the broadest possible swath of the science-inspired community.\u201d\n\nThe museum recently received a grant from the Still Water Foundation to conduct engineering and architectural planning studies to redesign its Dinosaur Trackways Building, a 1940 Work Projects Administration (WPA) building that houses 113-million-year-old dinosaur footprints, discovered in Texas. The grant will also support a new conservation study on how to preserve the actual dinosaur tracks.\n\nThe museum frequently hosts educational programs for the public, such as an upcoming fossil identification event on National Fossil Day, Oct. 16. As part of its anniversary celebrations, the museum will host an outdoor screening of \u201cJurassic Park\u201d at 7:30 p.m. on Oct. 5. This is a ticketed event."

        "source": "The Denver Post",
        "article_content": "When psychedelic-assisted therapy becomes available in Colorado next year, the state will be just the second in the U.S. to regulate the production and use of psilocybin mushrooms.\n\nOregon was the first state to legalize psilocybin therapy in 2020 and mental health-focused businesses there began offering it in 2023. Unsurprisingly, local regulators have looked to Oregon for guidance as they develop their own rules and regulations.\n\nThere are already lessons to be learned. A year and a half after the nascent industry got off the ground, some of Oregon\u2019s psilocybin service centers are struggling to stay open. One in Portland closed earlier this year after operating for just six months.\n\nOregon\u2019s service centers are where people go to have a therapeutic psilocybin experience or a guided trip, if you will. (In Colorado, these facilities are called \u201chealing centers.\u201d) But in Oregon, owners say the cost of doing business is so expensive that it threatens the model altogether.\n\nLast June, Dee Lafferty opened Inner Guidance Services in Albany, Ore., which served about 165 clients in its first year. But when the time came to renew her center\u2019s license, which costs $10,000 annually, Lafferty launched a crowdfunding campaign to cover the expense.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the program in Oregon is not set up in a way to where it is profitable. So we do not have the $10,000,\u201d Lafferty said in a Facebook video promoting her campaign.\n\nBut the community stepped up, and within two days, eight people had donated enough money to help Inner Guidance Services reach its goal. While that provided a stopgap, Lafferty doesn\u2019t know how she\u2019ll cover next year\u2019s fee.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at what you have to pay for the facilitators, for the space, rent, electricity \u2014 all of the things that you have to have \u2014 what have you to pay sums up to more than what you make reasonably,\u201d she said.\n\nLicensing fees are a hot topic in Colorado, as regulators barrel toward finalizing what it will cost for entrepreneurs to participate in this new industry. It\u2019s one of the last pieces to get settled after they spent a year-plus determining occupational requirements for facilitators and rules governing the business ecosystem surrounding psychedelic therapy.\n\nChallenges like the ones Lafferty described were common in the early days of marijuana legalization, said Rachel Gillette, a Denver-based attorney and head of the cannabis and psychedelics group at the Holland & Hart law firm. Even today, banks, landlords and insurance companies often upcharge businesses that work with federally controlled substances because they\u2019re considered more risky, she said.\n\nAdditionally, these businesses are subject to a federal tax code that prohibits them from deducting operating expenses from taxable income, driving up costs.\n\n\u201cEverything seems to come with a little bit of premium on it because it\u2019s something that\u2019s federally illegal,\u201d Gillette said. \u201cUntil (psilocybin) loses its stigma, until it\u2019s federally legal in some respect, I think that continues, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nCompliance costs don\u2019t stop with initial licensure, she added. These young industries continually evolve and businesses need to adapt to new regulations. Gillette expects there will be a smaller customer base for psychedelic-assisted therapy because it\u2019s so new and because, unlike cannabis, Colorado won\u2019t permit retail mushroom dispensaries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time to build the business so that people understand what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see somebody opening their doors for a natural medicine center and having lines out the door like they did on the first day of recreational cannabis. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nPricy for patients\n\nThe solution to sustainability is not as simple as passing costs onto the customer, Lafferty said. Psilocybin services are already notoriously pricy in Oregon, where a single guided trip can cost thousands of dollars for the drugs and for a facilitator who supervises each client while they\u2019re under the influence for several hours. Although psychedelic-assisted therapy is considered a mental health treatment by those in the industry, it\u2019s not yet covered by insurance.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing we learned is that the way the Oregon model is set up, it\u2019s a little bit over the price range for our target market, which we knew, but it\u2019s been confirmed,\u201d Lafferty said.\n\nIn its first year, Inner Guidance Services provided the equivalent of $33,000 in free services to individuals who could not afford to pay, Lafferty said. Since opening, she expanded the center\u2019s offerings to include microdosing counseling and introductory low doses for people who are new to psilocybin or hesitant to commit to a large dose. People can also register for group sessions, which are cheaper because the cost is split among several participants.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to not close, so we are trying a little bit of everything,\u201d Lafferty said.\n\nJenna Kluwe, co-owner of the now-shuttered The Journey Service Center in Portland, said the public needs more education so they can see the value of their investment not just for the trip, but also the sessions before and after. Those sessions, called preparation and integration, are integral to long-lasting change, she said. Kluwe\u2019s clients have described a guided psilocybin trip as several years of talk therapy \u2014 and therapy on its own isn\u2019t always cheap.\n\n\u201cThe value of this needs to be emphasized more and more for folks. Not just the sticker shock, but the value,\u201d said Kluwe.\n\nThe Journey Service Center closed in March after its investor halted funding, she said. Kluwe now works at another center called Fractal Soul running its equity program.\n\nLowering barriers to entry\n\nOne difference between the programs in Colorado and Oregon is that the laws here allow healthcare providers to integrate psilocybin therapy into their existing practices. (In Oregon, the businesses, facilities and staff must be separate duplicating costs for current healthcare professionals like Lafferty, a social worker with a private practice.)\n\nRegulators created a micro-healing center license for those places that intend to host just a couple of psilocybin sessions per month versus specializing in that type of treatment. Advocates are adamant the micro-healing center license will lower the barriers to entry in Colorado and streamline access for individuals who already have a therapist or psychiatrist. During a rulemaking hearing on Sept. 16, however, they shared concerns that the currently proposed fees are too high.\n\nIn its draft rules, the Department of Revenue proposed micro-healing centers pay $3,000 for application and compliance fees in 2025, before ramping up to a cumulative $5,000 in 2026 and $12,000 by 2027. The phased increase in fees is intended to both incentivize early participation and eventually fund the agency\u2019s administrative work overseeing the industry, regulators said.\n\nShannon Hughes is a social worker who currently offers ketamine-assisted therapy at her practice, An Enduring Love, in Fort Collins. She sees psilocybin as another tool in the behavioral health toolkit and hopes to integrate it once it\u2019s legal. An Enduring Love gets calls weekly from people interested in trying it.\n\nThe most logical way to offer that option would be to obtain a micro-healing center license, Hughes said. But if she had to pay $12,000 per year to do so, \u201cit would not fiscally make sense for our small practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know anybody in the mental health community who that would be viable for,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo I was disappointed and discouraged because you have to be a large operation to afford $12,000-plus in fees.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that all license types, including those for cultivation and manufacturing, will be subject to increased fees by 2027. For example, the latest draft rules dictate a standard healing center \u2013 meaning one that intends to specialize in psychedelic-assisted therapy \u2013 would be required to pay $6,000 in application and compliance fees in 2025, $8,000 in 2026, and $16,000 by 2027.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a concern that this current structure and approach will be an inoperable program,\u201d Tasia Poinsatte, director of the Healing Advocacy Fund, said during the recent rulemaking hearing, citing challenges in Oregon. \u201cIf we set fees that high and discourage participation today, it\u2019s going to make it that much harder to get this off the ground in the first place.\u201d\n\nRegulators plan to discuss licensing fees again at a meeting on Oct. 21.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get health news sent straight to your inbox."

Maskot/Getty Images\n\nWhether it's a new dance on TikTok or a technological breakthrough, trends are a core part of daily life, and the project management landscape is no different. Understanding current trends in project management can influence goals and inspire action \u2014 which could lead to bigger and better outcomes for your business.\n\nKnowing the latest project management trends can help you plan better, stay ahead of the competition, overcome common project management challenges, and develop your team efficiently. To that end, we've gathered eight project management trends for 2024 specifically tailored for small businesses.\n\n1. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nArtificial intelligence is the single most significant current trend in project management.\n\n\u201cAI can suggest how to break down tasks into more manageable chunks, and those results can be discussed with the project team,\u201d says Craig Guarraci, founder of Tech PM Career Path, LLC, a career coaching company. He adds that \u201cAI can be used to take meeting notes, determine action items, and to send the notes to attendees, thus freeing up the project manager's time.\u201d\n\nFrom using generative AI to speed up project planning to leveraging AI's automation capabilities to handle repetitive or menial tasks, businesses are relying more and more on the power of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning to improve project outcomes and reach broader business goals.\n\nThrough AI, businesses can also determine what projects they should undertake and learn what other organizations are doing to stay ahead.\n\n\u201cAI could be used by a project manager to brainstorm nearly anything about the project and learn about similar projects,\u201d says Guarraci\n\n2. Putting outcomes over inputs\n\nEspecially with growth projects, project managers and businesses are placing a stronger emphasis on the tangible outcomes of projects than the amount of work that goes in. By focusing on outcomes, projects align more with business goals, and project managers can more easily define success.\n\nA key way to focus on project outcomes is through change management \u2014 both handling changes throughout a project carefully and efficiently and being mindful of organizational changes a project can cause.\n\n\u201cIt's great to complete a project on time, on budget, and within scope, but it's even greater to address change throughout the project lifecycle to ensure [the] realization of benefits,\u201d says Nicole Pietrangelo, project management consultant. \u201cAfter all, that's the real reason why we're doing projects.\u201d\n\nProject managers and business owners can also pivot toward putting outcomes over inputs by:\n\nShifting success metrics to highlight deliverables instead of the time spent on a task or the number of tasks completed\n\nUsing agile methodologies to keep projects transparent and focused on goals\n\nWorking backward from desired long-term goals when planning projects rather than starting from short-term needs or capabilities\n\n3. Hybrid and remote workspaces\n\nRemote and hybrid work arrangements are a major trend in project management and employment, partially due to changes made during the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMany employees and employers have found ways to make remote or hybrid work a cost-saving benefit that also improves some workers' work-life balance and overall happiness. Additionally, Upwork's Future of Remote Work study found that one-third of hiring managers say productivity has increased with remote working.\n\nHowever, hybrid and remote workspaces create a specific challenge for project management: it\u2019s difficult to communicate and collaborate with your team when they\u2019re spread across the globe.\n\n\u201cSomething to be aware of, especially in remote work, is the importance and impact of emotional intelligence and understanding that different people communicate differently,\u201d says Bill Morris IV, Director of Project Management at Morris, a custom thermal solutions company. \u201cAs an example, this may mean picking up the phone and calling someone instead of sending a quick email, even if the latter may seem quicker and easier.\u201d\n\nProject management programs and software have responded to this challenge by making communication and collaboration within the program more efficient. Other tools and cloud-based project management software, such as Microsoft Teams, Google Drive, Dropbox, Asana, Monday, and Slack, make asynchronous work more attainable and seamless.\n\n4. Bigger reliance on data\n\nBusinesses are turning towards data to drive decision-making at all levels to achieve bigger goals. By using data, outcomes can be better predicted, anomalies can be defined, and failures can be used as tools to achieve greater success in the future.\n\nA key trend in project management is making data-driven decisions from the beginning stages of project planning.\n\n\u201cData-driven decision-making is very important,\u201d says Joe Bowab, CEO and founder of Lobster Anywhere. \u201cIt can help improve efficiency and can help make vital decisions regarding the progress of the project.\u201d\n\nSome of the ways project managers can utilize data more effectively in their projects include:\n\nBasing project success on data-driven metrics\n\nMonitoring data points throughout a project to ensure things are on track\n\nUsing historical data to inform decisions\n\n5. Increased focus on cybersecurity\n\nIncreasing cybersecurity measures may seem like just an IT project management trend, but cybersecurity attacks can affect every area of a business. Striking a balance between safety and efficiency is a challenging line to toe, but it\u2019s vital for companies to keep their employees and data safe from cyberattacks.\n\nSome ways businesses are improving their cybersecurity in project management include:\n\nEstablishing role-based permissions to data and programs\n\nHolding periodic cybersecurity training sessions\n\nHaving dedicated cybersecurity experts on staff to review projects and ensure there aren\u2019t any holes\n\n6. Prioritizing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices\n\nBusinesses are becoming ever more mindful of ways to minimize their impact on the environment and local communities. As businesses shift toward more sustainable practices, project managers must prioritize ESG practices throughout the project life cycle.\n\nAdditionally, business leaders may be relying on project managers to see through environmentally conscious initiatives, especially in areas like infrastructure and energy.\n\nSome ways to keep ESG at the heart of project management are:\n\nAnalyzing the environmental impact of project practices and sourcing greener options when possible\n\nFinding ways to make projects benefit local communities and society as a whole in addition to meeting strategic business goals\n\nCrafting ethical standards for projects and meeting local, state, and federal regulatory requirements\n\n7. Being mindful of resource scarcity\n\nWith the ever-changing and uncertain economic environment, it\u2019s imperative for companies of all sizes, especially small businesses, to look for ways to stay competitive while staying mindful of their resources. Project managers have to find ways to do more with less, which requires getting creative with project planning and resourcing.\n\nSome ways for businesses to hop on the trend of being mindful of resources include:\n\nAdopting agile methodologies to keep projects efficient\n\nLeveraging technology, like software and AI, to streamline tasks and automate some project aspects\n\nUtilize free project management software and freelance work to minimize project expenses (Try Monday, HubSpot, or ClickUp for free.)\n\nGet stakeholders involved to capitalize on their knowledge and outside perspective\n\n8. Increasing communication and transparency\n\nProject managers have always walked a tight line between transparency and security. On the one hand, keeping a project under tight wraps can prevent information leaks, and having strict silos may allow employees to focus better on their tasks.\n\nHowever, building a more transparent project environment where communication is encouraged can help introduce new ideas, build a stronger sense of connection to work for team members, and mitigate confusion, especially in large-scale projects. As many teams shift toward agile methodologies, communication is key.\n\nBeyond the rapid technological advancements in project management, managers also must \u201cbecome expert problem-solvers, critical thinkers, communicators, and leaders,\u201d says Pietrangelo. \u201cWhile technological advancements lead to new processes and ways of working, project managers need to understand how to guide their teams through change and establish trust during uncertain times.\u201d\n\nSome ways to consider improving your project team\u2019s communication and transparency include:\n\nUtilizing asynchronous communication methods, like Slack or Microsoft Teams\n\nGiving frequent updates on project progress\n\nPromoting cross-team collaboration on projects\n\nBottom line: Understanding trends in project management\n\nIn 2024, staying ahead of the curve means embracing project management trends like leveraging AI, making data-driven decisions, and prioritizing ESG practices. Ensuring your business is flexible and adaptable to the ebbs and flows of the project management landscape is crucial for ensuring your projects meet business goals and deliver meaningful results.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat are the latest trends in project management?\n\nSome of the latest trends in project management include integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into project processes and relying on data to drive decisions. Other trends, like doing more with fewer resources and staying mindful of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices, are crucial for many project management teams.\n\nWhat are the future trends in project management?\n\nFuture trends in project management will rely heavily on technological advances. As AI becomes more broadly integrated, new ways to leverage it for project management are inevitable. Additionally, the environmental impact of projects will continue to be a priority for many businesses, and brainstorming project ideas that can improve how businesses impact and interact with the environment will only become more necessary as climate change evolves.\n\nWhat are some types of project management?"
