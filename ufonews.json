        "article_content": "Q: We are seeking records on UFOs, and were told to try the Freedom of Information Act. First question, can you explain the Freedom of Information Act? Then, how do we go about requesting records?\n\nJ.V., Glendale\n\nA: The Freedom of Information Act (abbreviated as FOIA) provides you with the right to request access to records of the executive branch of the United States government. The records are to be provided, unless they are subject to certain exemptions whose purpose is to protect disclosure deemed harmful to: (a) national security, (b) privacy of individuals, (c) proprietary business information (such as trade secrets), (d) the actual functioning of our government, and/or (e) other interests that are deemed of significant importance. The exemptions are real, but FOIA requests often are productive.\n\nThe act dates from 1967 and took many years to become law. The objective is to make our government more transparent. As to UFOs (which the government now refers to as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d), federal agencies have been required this year to organize and tag documents. Congress has expressed clear interest in determining what agencies know about UFOs. Thus, the agencies are to disclose their information by the end of this fiscal year. The records are also to be housed at the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nHere, then, is an outline of a FOIA request you can consider: Using letterhead, set forth the date you are sending it; then list the name and address of the executive agency where the request is being sent; then \u201cRE: FOIA REQUEST\u201d; followed by \u201cDear Sir or Madam: This is an authorized request to you under the Freedom of Information Act. Please provide the following records to the undersigned on a timely basis. \u2026\u201d Here, clearly set forth the records sought, describing them, if possible, by year(s), name of the party or parties involved, and/or the circumstances or events in focus. Then close the FOIA request with a sign off.\n\nNote that some agencies have instructions on where a FOIA request is to be sent (you can look for that online, or call to inquire). While it is not required that the FOIA request be transmitted by certified mail/return receipt requested, doing so is one way to seek to show that you not only sent it, but that it was received. The agency is required to respond within 20 working days (excluding weekends and legal holidays).\n\nQ: There was a local incident that at first was well reported. An older person was run over by a hit-and-run driver. We think they have since found the identity of the driver, who may be a local official, but there is radio silence. Our neighbor suggests we try a Public Records Act request. Can you give us some guidance on that?\n\nM.B., (location withheld)\n\nRelated Articles News | Am I liable for a slip and fall at a bowling alley?

Ask the lawyer A: The Public Records Act is found at California Government Code Sections 6250 through 6277. The act gives you, as a member of the public, the right to request information from California governmental agencies, which includes both state and local/municipal governments. In some instances, you may be able to learn online or by phone where to send the request, depending on which agency the request is going to (such as, the police department, highway patrol, zoning commission, district attorney\u2019s office or mayor\u2019s office, among others). As with a FOIA request, be specific about what you are seeking, and to whom and where the records are to be sent. The agency has 10 calendar days to respond to you, but may indicate it needs more time to locate, review and produce the records (which can mean a 14-day extension for \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d).\n\nAs with a FOIA request, some records may be deemed confidential or otherwise off-limits.\n\nA Public Records Act request, however, should not be costly or time consuming. It is the law, and compliance is expected to the extent authorized and permissible. I cannot say the request will unveil what you are looking for, and records you get may have redactions (which the agency can seek to justify), but, as they say, \u201cnothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d\n\nRon Sokol has been a practicing attorney for over 40 years, and has also served many times as a judge pro tem, mediator, and arbitrator. It is important to keep in mind that this column presents a summary of the law, and is not to be treated or considered legal advice, let alone a substitute for actual consultation with a qualified professional."

        "article_content": "It\u2019s been a tumultuous week for OpenAI, full of executive departures and major fundraising developments, but the startup is back at it, trying to convince developers to build tools with its AI models at its 2024 DevDay. The company announced several new tools Tuesday, including a public beta of its \u201cRealtime API\u201d, for building apps with low-latency, AI-generated voice responses. It\u2019s not quite ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode, but it\u2019s close.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters ahead of the event, OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil said the recent departures of chief technology officer Mira Murati and chief research officer Bob McGrew would not affect the company\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with saying Bob and Mira have been awesome leaders. I\u2019ve learned a lot from them, and they are a huge part of getting us to where we are today,\u201d said Weil. \u201cAnd also, we\u2019re not going to slow down.\u201d\n\nAs OpenAI undergoes yet another C-suite overhaul \u2013 a reminder of the turmoil following last year\u2019s DevDay \u2013 the company is trying to convince developers that it still offers the best platform to build AI apps on. Leaders say the startup has more than 3 million developers building with its AI models, but OpenAI is operating in an increasingly competitive space.\n\nOpenAI noted it had cut costs for developers to access its API by 99% in the last two years, though it was likely forced to by competitors such as Meta and Google continuously undercutting their prices.\n\nOne of OpenAI\u2019s new features, dubbed the Realtime API, will give developers the chance to build nearly real-time, speech-to-speech experiences in their apps, with the choice of using six voices provided by OpenAI. These voices are distinct from those offered for ChatGPT, and developers can\u2019t use third party voices, in order to prevent copyright issues. (The voice ambiguously based on Scarlett Johansson\u2019s is not available anywhere.)\n\nDuring the briefing, OpenAI\u2019s head of developer experience, Romain Huet, shared a demo of a trip planning app built with the Realtime API. The application allowed users to verbally speak with an AI assistant about an upcoming trip to London, and get low-latency responses. The Realtime API also has access to a number of tools, so the app was able to annotate a map with restaurant locations as it answered.\n\nAt another point, Huet showed how the Realtime API could speak on the phone with a human to inquire about ordering food for an event. Unlike Google\u2019s infamous Duo, OpenAI\u2019s API can\u2019t call restaurants or shops directly; however, it can integrate with calling APIs like Twilio to do so. Notably, OpenAI is not adding disclosures so that its AI models automatically identify themselves on calls like this, despite the fact that these AI-generated voices sounds quite realistic. For now, it seems to be the developers\u2019 responsibility to add this disclosure, something that could be required by a new California law.\n\nAs part of its DevDay announcements, OpenAI also introduced vision fine-tuning in its API, which will let developers use images, as well as text, to fine-tune their applications of GPT-4o. This should, in theory, help developers improve the performance of GPT-4o for tasks involving visual understanding. OpenAI\u2019s head of product API, Olivier Godement, tells TechCrunch that developers will not be able to upload copyrighted imagery (such as a picture of Donald Duck), images that depict violence, or other imagery that violates OpenAI\u2019s safety policies.\n\nOpenAI is racing to match what its competitors in the AI model licensing space already offer. Its prompt caching feature is similar to the feature Anthropic launched several months agoallowing developers to cache frequently used context between API calls, reducing costs and improve latency. OpenAI says developers can save 50% using this feature, whereas Anthropic promises a 90% discount for it.\n\nLastly, OpenAI is offering a model distillation feature to let developers use larger AI models, such as o1-preview and GPT-4o, to fine-tune smaller models such as GPT-4o mini. Running smaller models generally provides cost savings compare to running larger ones, but this feature should let developers improve the performance of those small AI models. As part of model distillation, OpenAI is launching a beta evaluation tool so developers can measure their fine-tune\u2019s performance within OpenAI\u2019s API.\n\nDevDay may make bigger waves for what it didn\u2019t announce \u2013 for instance, there wasn\u2019t any news on the GPT Store announced during last year\u2019s DevDay. Last we\u2019ve heard, OpenAI has been piloting a revenue share program with some of the most popular creators of GPTs, but the company hasn\u2019t announced much since then.\n\nAlso, OpenAI says it\u2019s not releasing any new AI models during DevDay this year. Developers waiting for OpenAI o1 (not the preview or mini version) or the startup\u2019s video generation model, Sora, will have to wait a little longer."

        "article_content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 ChatGPT maker OpenAI will allow any app developer to add snappy and humanlike voice interaction to their products, a move that could greatly increase the number of people interacting with a slick and sometimes provocative new generation of artificial intelligence technology. OpenAI\u2019s \u201cadvanced voice mode,\u201d which offers six AI voices that sound casual and expressive, with the ability to detect and react to different human vocal tones, has been available to ChatGPT subscribers since July. The technology will now be offered to the thousands of companies that pay to use OpenAI technology in their own products \u2014 and any new developer who signs up.\n\nOpening more of its AI inventions to outsiders could help grow OpenAI\u2019s revenue from usage fees it charges each time an app taps its technology. Increasing that income is crucial to the company, which is seeking billions of dollars in new funding and considering restructuring to remove its business from the control of its existing nonprofit board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI announced it was opening access to its voice technology at an event in San Francisco for software developers. At a news briefing ahead of the event, OpenAI executives showed how an app built on its voice technology could make a phone call to a business and place an order for chocolate strawberries.\n\nThe business was not real and the person who took down the order and asked questions that the AI voice nimbly responded to was an OpenAI executive role-playing, but app developers will be able to deploy that capability immediately, the executives said.\n\n\u201cWe want to make it possible to interact with AI in all of the ways you interact with a human being,\u201d OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil said at the press briefing.\n\nFully achieving that goal would be challenging with existing AI technology, which often makes mistakes. But if app developers rush to build on OpenAI\u2019s voice algorithms, many more people could soon be using or exposed to automated systems that capably mimic people in some scenarios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRealistic voice synthesis technology has already been used in some call centers, but if OpenAI succeeds in making it more sophisticated and widespread, then consumers could encounter fresh frustrations or scams as well as new conveniences.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission last week fined a political consultant $6 million for using AI to fake the voice of President Joe Biden in New Hampshire robocalls earlier this year.\n\nIn 2018, Google debuted its AI voice bot, Google Duplex, that could call restaurants or salons to make reservations. But the humans employed by local businesses receiving the calls didn\u2019t always like it.\n\nInitially, Duplex did not disclose that it was a piece of software, until the backlash prompted Google to reprogram it to always introduce itself as an AI system. The feature hasn\u2019t caught on broadly, although Google Pixel phones can screen calls using similar technology and the company\u2019s cloud unit offers voice technology for call centers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoice bots have drastically improved over the past several years, with OpenAI\u2019s new voice mode for ChatGPT winning plaudits for its ability to carry out snappy conversations, understand complex topics and questions, sing, and respond to different tones of voice when it was first unveiled in May.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s system has been tuned to sound eager and polite, similar to the tone of ChatGPT\u2019s textual answers. The company offers six voices to choose from but retired its initial default, called \u201cSky,\u201d after Scarlett Johansson alleged the company copied her voice without permission. Documents shared with The Washington Post indicate a different actor was hired for recordings used to make the voice.\n\nOpenAI says 3 million developers in dozens of countries are now experimenting with its technology and using it to build new apps and features. Opening up its latest voice features could help grow that crucial user base and the revenue it provides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome tech investors and entrepreneurs say that just as the internet incubated giants such as Google and smartphones enabled businesses such as Uber and DoorDash, artificial intelligence will also spawn a wave of start-ups that become integral to peoples\u2019 lives.\n\nOther AI experts caution that new capabilities such as convincingly expressive voices can cause havoc in the wrong hands. An AI narration service marketed for audiobooks and video games was adapted to make the fake Biden robocalls placed in New Hampshire in January.\n\nOpenAI says that its rules ban developers from using its services to spam, mislead or harm people, and that it has built systems that monitor how people use its technology to shut down any who don\u2019t comply.\n\nDevelopers tapping the new voice offering must \u201cmake it clear to their users that they are interacting with AI, unless it\u2019s obvious from the context,\u201d the company said in a blog post about the new tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI\u2019s systems have been abused in the past, despite similar rules being in place for ChatGPT and its other services, including a ban on political campaigning."

You\u2019ll also find a new Welcome Recap screen greeting you when you first open up your laptop, reminding you of what you were working on earlier and giving you some tips for what to start with now. And for stuff you\u2019re frequently working with, and don\u2019t want to lose track of, you can easily pin files to your Chromebook\u2019s shelf.\n\nChromebook Plus models are getting a few upgrades beyond what the rest of the lineup will see, including AI-powered Live Translate for basically anything you\u2019re watching on your Chromebook screen. If you\u2019re looking to capture a conversation, the new Recorder app will offer automatic transcriptions, complete with speaker labels and summaries. And speaking of audio, Google\u2019s implementing some AI-based microphone simulation models to offer the highest possible fidelity on all your video calls. There are even some tweaks to boost camera performance, and neither of these upgrades will be restricted to Meet, and should offer enhanced performance across the board.\n\nLanh Nguyen / Android Authority\n\nThis new Chromebook Plus stuff should start arriving as updates hitting your Chromebook across the month of October \u2014 don\u2019t be surprised if you don\u2019t see it land immediately, nor all at once. There\u2019s also the summary \u201cHelp me read\u201d feature for PDFs and websites that will start deploying in the weeks to come, and is already set to get a big update next year, letting you specify passages that require more detailed explanation.\n\nFinally, if any of this new functionality gets you feeling particularly excited about the power of AI (and we\u2019re betting Google hopes it might), the company is extending its offer for three free months of Google One AI Premium to all new Chromebook purchases.\n\nGot a tip?

After debuting in 1999, the story of softhearted Nana has prompted live-action movies, Hello Kitty collabs, and rabid TikTok fandom, but its success hasn't guaranteed Yazawa's other work the same star treatment.\n\nLast Quarter \u2013 Yazawa's supernatural shoujo manga from 1998 \u2013 has been lost to the English-speaking world until this fall when VIZ Media released the first in a two-book series of the manga's first English translation. Even though it's taken 26 years, I'm grateful that Last Quarter can finally brush off the cemetery dirt and get back onto dusty bookshelves. Its intoxicating suspense is a perfect example of what draws me to paranormal romance.\n\nIn the manga, Mizuki \u2013 with the Rapunzel hair and platform heels characteristic of a Yazawa heroine \u2013 meets Adam by chance. He's a moody musician, another Yazawa trademark, and impossible to resist, so Mizuki stops going to high school. \"The rest of my life\u2026belongs to you,\" she decides.\n\nArt from Last Quarter.\n\nBut life gets in the way. Though Mizuki is too in love to see it, something's wrong with Adam. His hands are freezing, and yet he leaves the windows wide open, for all of March's cold wind to curl through. He lives in an opulent apartment, but neighbors say it's been empty for decades, and when Mizuki ends up there alone, she discovers she can't leave. No one can hear her or see her, either, apart from a blue-eyed cat and the gracious fifth grader Hotaru, who Mizuki meets in a dream.\n\nSince the Jane Eyre days, two things have made a paranormal romance story really worthwhile: the man, and the mystery. I think Last Quarter is an emblematic paranormal romance because it excels at both.\n\nLike Mr. Rochester, like Edward, like Patrick Swayze in Ghost, Adam is beautiful and frightening in Last Quarter, as plausible as a monster as he is a husband. He doesn't appear often in book one, but his bright eyes make a lasting impression.\n\nArt from Last Quarter.\n\nAs French philosopher Roland Barthes writes in A Lover's Discourse, \"isn't desire always the same, whether the object is present or absent?\" Even after she's forgotten her own name, losing herself in days as repetitive as a nightmare, Mizuki still pines for Adam. She tasks Hotaru and her friends with bringing Adam back to her, declaring that, \"I don't care if Hell comes afterward. No matter how wonderful Heaven might be, if Adam isn't there, it would be meaningless to me.\"\n\nMizuki's body-aching desire for Adam and what he represents \u2013 adulthood, novelty, potential \u2013 dissolves whatever boundaries we, as readers, have separating our love from fear. That's always my favorite part of the paranormal romance experience, embracing every possibility of fear. In the unknown, I find red connective tissue and the unmistakable, metallic glint of excitement.\n\nI take the same away from Julietta Suzuki's 2022 manga series, Otaku Vampire's Love Bite, which Viz Media is also beginning to translate. In book one, released today, the perky Romanian vampire Hina has a crush on the gloomy human Amanatsu. He shares a sexy haircut and entire face with her favorite anime character, delectably blending reality and fiction.\n\nArt from Otaku Vampire's Love Bite.\n\nIt's a tantalizing mystery, the second ingredient in what I think is a winning paranormal romance story. And in Last Quarter, whose grayscale panels are often moonlit and melancholy, strangeness drives the plot more than a male protagonist with luscious hair. Little Hotaru is determined to help Mizuki rediscover her identity, and the truth of the dream-place where they first met. Was it purgatory? An omen?\n\nThrough Hotaru and Mizuki's intertwining and opaque fates, Last Quarter establishes a creeping anxiety as absorbing as its romantic elements. That's also what I find fascinating about Junji Ito's popular 1998 horror manga series Uzumaki . Unlike Last Quarter, Uzumaki has disproportionately more people spiraling in slimy agony than in thriving relationships. Its ending \u2013 and spoilers ahead \u2013 though, creates a satisfying combination of both; narrator Kirie and her boyfriend Shuichi collapse in a pile of dry and twisted corpses, holding each other close while their arms grow long and coil together.\n\nAs much as I enjoy mainstream horror manga's spilled blood and bloated bodies, I'm glad shoujo horror like Last Quarter is now starting to be translated. Aside from Uzumaki, it's rare that horror manga has a notable romance element, and when it does, it's often presented in the form of a misogynistic yandere crime scene. But Last Quarter protects the girls in its pages, subjecting them to the uncanny only in the context of tenderness. That's what I want from paranormal romance. It reminds me that nothing is pure, and nothing is doomed.\n\nStill in a manga mood? Check out our picks for the 10 best manga from 2023."

        "article_content": "Scientists have discovered the deep-frozen, mummified carcass of a young woolly rhinoceros in Siberia's ice that was feasted on by predators tens of thousands of years ago.\n\nThe woolly rhino's right side is well preserved, with patches of skin and fur that have stayed intact over millennia, but its left side shows the youngster was mauled in the hours preceding or following its death.\n\n\"From the upper part of the thigh to the level of the shoulder blade, [the carcass] is severely destroyed,\" researchers from the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Sakha wrote in a study documenting the carcass, published July 1 in the journal Doklady Earth Sciences . \"The internal cavity of the body is exposed, and most of the intestines are missing.\"\n\nFrom the mangled carcass, \"it is obvious that the left side of the mummy was eaten by predators,\" the researchers wrote. Remains of tiny crustaceans embedded in the fur also indicate the woolly rhino (Coelodonta antiquitatis) died in a shallow pool of water, the team noted.\n\nRadiocarbon dating suggests the young woolly rhino died and froze more than 32,000 years ago.\n\nWoolly rhinos roamed the Arctic tundra between 460,000 and 12,000 years ago , during the last ice age . They were huge beasts and the second largest herbivores in the mammoth steppe ecosystem after woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius). Like mammoths, woolly rhinos were well-adapted to the cold climate thanks to their coat of shaggy fur \u2014 but scientists still know very little about these prehistoric animals, according to the study.\n\nRelated: 'Closer than people think': Woolly mammoth 'de-extinction' is nearing reality \u2014 and we have no idea what happens next\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

They dubbed the animal \"Abyisky rhinoceros\" after the local district and sent its remains to the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Sakha, where the carcass currently sits in a freezer.\n\nFor the new study, researchers temporarily defrosted the carcass and took samples of skin, fur and soft tissue for analysis. They also examined the woolly rhino's teeth, measured the length of one of its horns and noted the size of a large hump on its back, which appeared to be filled with fat.\n\nIllustration of a woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). (Image credit: De Agostini via Getty Images)\n\nThe horn was 9.4 inches (24 centimeters) long and presented three to four dark patches that typically correspond to the number of years lived by a rhinoceros, according to the study. The height at the shoulder of the carcass was close to 4.3 feet (130 cm). Together, this indicates the woolly rhino was 4 to 4.5 years old when it died and hadn't reached sexual maturity.\n\nIts fur was darker than that of a smaller woolly rhino calf discovered in 2014 in the same district. That calf, named \"Sasha,\" was frozen for at least 10,000 years and covered in thin, almost-blond hair . In contrast, adult woolly rhinos that were previously pulled from the ice have coarse, dark brown fur.\n\n\"The fur of the Abyisky rhinoceros has a uniform light brown color due to the combination of white, beige, and brown hair,\" the researchers wrote in the study. \"The coat is darker on the ears and feet and lighter on the back, belly, and hind legs.\"\n\nRemarkably, the Abyisky rhinoceros also had a 5-inch-high (13 cm) hump filled with fatty mass on its back, the likes of which scientists had never seen on a woolly rhino carcass. Fatty humps are relatively common in Arctic animals, Love Dal\u00e9n , a professor of evolutionary genomics at Stockholm University in Sweden who was not involved in the study, told CNN . They evolved to beat the cold and store energy for when times get tough, he said.\n\nThe newly discovered 4-year-old appears to represent an intermediate stage of woolly rhino development. Specimens with preserved tissues like this one are invaluable for further research, and particularly for genetic tests that cannot be done on bones, Dal\u00e9n said."

        "article_content": "Did you know that China has invested over $15 billion in quantum computing research? This staggering figure highlights the intense global competition to lead in this groundbreaking technology. Quantum computing, which uses the unique properties of qubits, has the potential to solve problems that are currently beyond the reach of classical computers. However, this technological marvel also poses substantial security risks, particularly in encryption.\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Quantum computing leverages quantum physics for complex computations beyond classical computers.\n\nIBM\u2019s Quantum System 2 is a significant milestone, utilizing qubits that can exist in superposition.\n\nQuantum computers use superposition and entanglement to solve complex problems instantaneously.\n\nPotential applications include new material discovery, accelerated drug discovery, and advanced simulations.\n\nChallenges include maintaining qubit stability and the need for extremely low temperatures.\n\nThe U.S. and China are leading the race in quantum computing with significant investments.\n\nQuantum computing poses security risks to current encryption methods, prompting the development of quantum key distribution (QKD).\n\nInternational collaboration is crucial but hindered by geopolitical tensions.\n\nQuantum computing\u2019s full potential is expected to be realized by 2033, impacting scientific discovery and global power dynamics.\n\nQuantum computing has significant technological and geopolitical implications, with the potential to benefit all of humanity.\n\nThis groundbreaking technology promises to bring about significant advancements across various fields, from material science and drug discovery to cryptography and artificial intelligence. However, it also introduces substantial security risks, particularly in the realm of encryption. The race to develop quantum computing has become a focal point of international competition, with the United States and China leading the charge.\n\nIBM\u2019s Quantum Research Milestones\n\nIBM\u2019s research facility is at the forefront of quantum computing development, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with this innovative technology. The introduction of the IBM Quantum System 2 marks a significant milestone in the field, bringing us closer to realizing the full potential of quantum computing. Central to this technology are quantum bits, or qubits, which are the building blocks of quantum computers. Unlike classical bits, which can only exist in a state of either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a state of superposition, meaning they can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This remarkable property allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of data at unprecedented speeds, tackling complex problems that would take classical computers centuries to solve.\n\nCore Principles of Quantum Computing\n\nThe fundamental difference between classical bits and qubits lies in their quantum mechanical nature. While classical computers use bits to perform calculations sequentially, quantum computers use the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to solve complex problems in a fraction of the time. Entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more qubits become correlated in such a way that their states are dependent on each other, regardless of the distance between them. This alignment with the quantum mechanical nature of the universe enables quantum computers to tackle problems that are currently unsolvable by classical means, opening up new frontiers in scientific discovery and technological advancement.\n\nQuantum computers use superposition and entanglement to solve complex problems\n\nQubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, unlike classical bits\n\nQuantum computing aligns with the quantum mechanical nature of the universe\n\nQuantum Computing Explained\n\nHere are a selection of other articles from our extensive library of content you may find of interest on the subject of Quantum computing :\n\nTransformative Applications\n\nQuantum computing holds the potential to transform various fields, from material science and drug discovery to cryptography and artificial intelligence. In the field of material science, quantum computers can simulate the behavior of complex molecules and materials at an unprecedented level of accuracy, leading to the discovery of new materials with unique properties that could have far-reaching implications for industries such as energy, electronics, and aerospace. In the realm of medicine, quantum simulations can accelerate the process of drug discovery by accurately modeling the interactions between molecules and proteins, allowing the development of targeted therapies for diseases that have long eluded conventional treatments. Additionally, quantum computers can simulate the behavior of atoms and subatomic particles, providing insights into the fundamental nature of the universe and allowing the design of advanced materials and pharmaceuticals.\n\nQuantum computing can transform material science, drug discovery, and fundamental physics\n\nQuantum simulations can accurately model molecular interactions and accelerate drug development\n\nQuantum computers can provide insights into the fundamental nature of the universe\n\nChallenges and Limitations\n\nDespite its immense promise, quantum computing faces significant challenges that must be overcome before it can reach its full potential. One of the biggest challenges is maintaining qubits in a stable state, as they are highly susceptible to environmental disturbances such as temperature fluctuations, electromagnetic interference, and even vibrations. To preserve the delicate quantum states necessary for computation, qubits must be kept at extremely low temperatures, close to absolute zero, which requires sophisticated cooling systems and shielding. Additionally, quantum computers are not yet outperforming classical supercomputers in practical applications, highlighting the need for further advancements in quantum stability, error correction, and scalability.\n\nMaintaining qubits in a stable state is a significant challenge\n\nQubits must be kept at extremely low temperatures to preserve quantum states\n\nFurther advancements in quantum stability, error correction, and scalability are needed\n\nGlobal Competition and Investments\n\nThe race to develop quantum computing is intensifying, with the United States and China at the forefront of this global competition. Both nations have made significant investments in quantum research and development, recognizing the strategic importance of leading in this transformative technology. China has committed over $15 billion to quantum research, demonstrating its determination to become a dominant player in the field. The United States has also made substantial investments, with government agencies such as the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation funding numerous quantum research projects.

        "article_content": "(This story has been updated to include new information.)\n\nFormer president Donald Trump returned to Wisconsin Tuesday, making campaign stops in Dane County and Milwaukee. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff also spoke in Milwaukee Tuesday afternoon on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.\n\nTrump delivered remarks at Dane Manufacturing in Waunakee, about 13 miles north of Madison, and then spoke in a closed-to-the-public event at Discovery World, a science museum along Lake Michigan, in Milwaukee.\n\nEmhoff spoke at Diamond Discs International, a small manufacturing business in Milwaukee. Harris last held a rally in Wisconsin Sept. 20 in Madison.\n\nHere's a recap of the day:\n\nTrump ends his remarks to the media in Milwaukee\n\nTrump wrapped up his event in Milwaukee around 7 p.m., about an hour before the vice presidential debate starts.\n\nHe took questions from reporters for about 45 minutes after giving remarks that were similar to the points he made in Waunakee.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump hints at potential rallies at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Green Bay\n\nWhile speaking at Discovery World, Trump hinted his team is looking at holding a rally at Fiserv Forum, which hosted the Republican National Convention in July. Harris also held a rally at the home of the Milwaukee Bucks during the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"The building was beautiful,\" Trump said. \"I love Milwaukee. We had such a great convention here. They treated us so well. I also like the result. If I didn't get the right result, I probably wouldn't like Milwaukee. I got a great result.\"\n\nTrump added he'll announce a rally in Green Bay soon, potentially the day before a Green Bay Packers game. He also hinted at a third event that would be similar to the press conference format of the Tuesday night event in Milwaukee, which was ultimately closed to the public.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nU.S. Rep. Bryan Steil praises Trump for campaigning in blue areas\n\nAt a panel discussion before Trump spoke in Milwaukee, Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil praised the former president for \"campaigning in two of the most blue areas of our state.\"\n\n\"We as conservatives, we as Republicans, we as supporters of President Trump, know that we have the answers to the challenges that our country faces, that our communities face. In particular, blue cities across the country, and the challenges that they face,\" Steil said.\n\nSteil said he attended the opening of a GOP Hispanic outreach center in Milwaukee this weekend. The state party announced the new center after the national party abandoned its own center in the city early last year.\n\nSteil said voters who were excited to vote for Trump connected with issues like inflation, school choice, crime and national defense.\n\nSteil represents the southeastern portion of Wisconsin, including Racine and Kenosha. He is running for reelection and faces Democratic opponent Peter Barca, who once held the seat.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nSpeakers focus on school choice ahead of Trump visit to Discovery World\n\nA panel of speakers that included advocates, elected officials, students and a school principal spoke ahead of Trump\u2019s arrival at Discovery World in Milwaukee.Their comments focused on school choice, with students speaking to the opportunities their schools have offered them.\u201cI can't tell you how many people I talk to, how many moms and dads I talk to about the importance of school choice, a policy championed by conservatives, championed by Republicans, championed by President Trump,\u201d Steil said.\n\n\u201cAnd it's a policy that says moms and dads should have a choice to choose the school that's best for their child, to make sure that their child is in an environment where there they can succeed.\u201d\u2014 Alison Dirr\n\nUnclear why Trump's Milwaukee event is closed to public\n\nWhile general admission tickets were available for Trump's appearance at Discovery World, the public was ultimately not allowed entry. Members of the media were let in for a press conference-like event, though some supporters lingered outside in the afternoon, hoping to be admitted.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service told the Journal Sentinel it wasn't tracking any security issues and any changes to the event format were likely a decision made by the campaign. The campaign declined to comment.\n\nThe Secret Service noted Trump is receiving a heightened level of Secret Service protection and \"there are significant security measures put into place for tonight's event.\"\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nDoug Emhoff addresses crowd at Diamond Disc International\n\nSecond gentlemen Doug Emhoff addressed about 100 people at Diamond Disc International, saying Harris is \u201ca capitalist, pro-growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe knows the limitations of government,\u201d Emhoff said, adding that Harris looks for \u201cpragmatic solutions.\u201d\n\nEmhoff also criticized Trump for \u201cducking\u201d a second debate.\n\n\u201cShe kicked his ass at that first debate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Ricardo Torres\n\nDiamond Disc president endorses Harris\n\nDiamond Discs International president Ugo Nwagbaraocha endorsed Harris for president, saying a Harris presidency would benefit businesses like his.\n\nNwagbaraocha said Trump \u201cdid nothing\u201d for his business and called the Foxconn project in Mount Pleasant \u201cWeasel-conn.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ricardo Torres\n\nTrump ends Waunakee speech around 3:20 p.m.\n\nTrump spoke for about an hour and 15 minutes in Waunakee, wrapping up his speech at 3:20 p.m.\n\n\"Remember, early mail-in voting is underway,\" Trump told the crowd. \"So vote, vote, vote. You got to get going.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to appear at Discovery World at 5 p.m. It's not yet clear whether he's making the hour-and-a-half drive or traveling by plane to Milwaukee.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump supporters line up outside Discovery World, hoping event remains public\n\nTrump supporters lined up outside Discovery World early Tuesday afternoon even as rumbles of the event\u2019s closure to the public were circulating among the crowd.\n\nBradley Kahn, 35, of Chicago said he had tried to attend a Trump event in 2015 but it was canceled. He\u2019s been hoping to see him since, and Milwaukee was a close destination.\n\nHe wanted to get a selfie Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf it gets canceled today, I would be pretty upset,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was hoping to hear from Trump about election strategy, particularly immigration policy and employment.\n\nAhead in the line, Kelly McAuliffe said she and her family members arrived at Discovery World from the Chicago suburbs around 5 a.m.\n\nShe said the event invitation said there was limited space but that, since she arrived, police had over time moved attendees back from the front door.\n\nBy early afternoon, the line of a few dozen people stretched west on the sidewalk between Discovery World and the Milwaukee Art Museum.\n\nShe was no longer optimistic that she and other supporters would be getting into the event.\n\n\u2014 Alison Dirr\n\nDoug Emhoff will visit Diamond Discs International\n\nSecond gentleman Doug Emhoff and former Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo will deliver remarks at Diamond Discs International, a small manufacturing business in Milwaukee.\n\nThey'll also get a tour of the building.\n\n\u2014 Ricardo Torres\n\nDoug Emhoff lands in Milwaukee\n\nTrump again criticizes prisoner swap involving WNBA star Brittney Griner\n\nTrump on Tuesday again criticized a prisoner swap involving WNBA star Brittney Griner and arms dealer Viktor Bout.\n\nBout, the so-called \u201cmerchant of death,\u201d was exchanged in a 2022 prisoner swap for Griner, who had spent nearly a year in Russian captivity.\n\nTrump again essentially accused Griner of not being patriotic enough, saying she \u201ctied her shoes\u201d during the national anthem.\n\nGriner played for Team USA in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, winning gold both times.\n\nThen, at the 2024 Paris Olympics, as Griner stood on the medal stand with her third gold medal draped around her neck, tears streamed down her face as she stood for the national anthem.\n\nLast year, Bout urged Trump to seek refuge in Russia, saying he believed his life was \u201cin peril.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mary Spicuzza\n\nTrump falsely claims immigrants are being signed up to vote\n\nWhile touching on immigration, Trump claimed immigrants are being registered to vote, a claim PolitiFact has debunked before.\n\n\"There's a reason why they let all these people in, because they want to get them to vote,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump didn't mention a Republican-led referendum question on the Nov. 5 ballot in Wisconsin, which aims to prevent noncitizens from voting in local elections in the future. Some cities in the U.S. do allow that, but nowhere in Wisconsin does.\n\nThe Wisconsin Elections Commission has said it knows of only four alleged cases of voter fraud related to citizenship since 2015. Wisconsin's voter registration form includes a checkbox confirming the voter is a U.S. citizen.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump calls Tommy Thompson 'the dean'\n\nTrump shouted out former Wisconsin governors Scott Walker and Tommy Thompson, who also spoke at the rally Tuesday. Trump called Thompson \"so respected\" and \"the dean.\"\n\nTrump said Thompson called him during his 2016 campaign, expressing doubts about Trump's ability to win Wisconsin and telling him to campaign in other battlegrounds.\n\n\"He said, 'Here's a deal. If I think you're going to win, I'll call you back,'\" Trump said. \"He called me about three weeks later. He said, 'It's time to come up. You're going to win this thing.'\"\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump falsely claims there was a 'coup' when Harris became Democratic nominee\n\nTrump again falsely claimed that there was a \u201ccoup\u201d when Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nHe added that Walker \u201csays it was a coup,\u201d and also mentioned Thompson as he repeated his claims that \u201cit was a coup.\u201d\n\nBut a coup, or coup d\u2019etat, is defined as a sudden, violent and unlawful seizure of power, experts say. So while Biden\u2019s exit from the race was unusual, experts say it does not amount to a \u201ccoup.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s comments undermining confidence in this year's presidential election echo the tactics he used in 2020 when he lost to Biden.\n\n\u2014 Mary Spicuzza\n\nTrump claims 50,000 people were turned away from Prairie du Chien rally\n\nAfter taking the stage at Dane Manufacturing, Trump claimed 50,000 to 60,000 people were turned away from his Saturday rally in Prairie du Chien.\n\nAbout a thousand people were standing in line to get into the rally, but the auditorium sat somewhere near 300 people.\n\nThe rally was initially planned to be held outdoors but switched to indoors over Secret Service staffing concerns. The agency was responsible for securing the United Nations General Assembly summit in New York on the same day.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump starts after about a 30-minute delay\n\nTrump took the stage at 2:05 p.m., about a half hour behind schedule.\n\nIn the meantime, attendees heard standard songs on Trump's rally playlist, including \"YMCA\" and \"Macho Man\" by the Village People and \"Gloria\" by Laura Branigan.\n\nThere were some newer additions: \"Give Me Everything\" by Pitbull and \"Thriller\" by Michael Jackson.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nWisconsin union president accuses Trump of 'shell game' on overtime\n\nA Wisconsin union president is accusing Trump of playing a \"shell game\" when it comes to overtime pay and protections.\n\n\"He is claiming that he will eliminate taxes on overtime pay but he fails to mention that he would do so by eliminating overtime pay altogether,\" Stephanie Bloomingdale, the Wisconsin AFL-CIO president, said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nShe referred to Trump's recent comments at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, that he \"hated\" to give overtime and \"wouldn't pay\" it.\n\nBloomingdale also referred to Project 2025, which Trump has been trying to distance himself from in recent months.\n\n\"When Donald Trump comes here and tries to sell this underhanded scam, we are wise to the lie he is again trying to sell,\" she said. \"The truth is that Donald Trump does not care about the well-being of Wisconsin working people and he never has.\"\n\n\u2014 Mary Spicuzza\n\nVice President Kamala Harris visiting areas affected by Hurricane Helene before Thursday's Wisconsin visit\n\nBefore heading to Wisconsin on Thursday, Harris will visit areas affected by Hurricane Helene.\n\nHarris is scheduled to go to Georgia on Wednesday, according to a White House pool report. She will also travel to North Carolina, the pool report said.\n\nTrump traveled to the storm-hit battleground state of Georgia to survey damage from Helene . Trump told reporters, \"We're not talking about politics now,\" but he then criticized Biden and Harris over the administration's hurricane response in the hours leading up to the trip.\n\nBiden has pushed back on false claims made by Trump over his response to the disaster.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a liar,\" read a post on X from Biden. \"I\u2019m working with governors and local officials to help those impacted by Hurricane Helene.\"\n\nHarris cut a previous campaign trip short to return to Washington, D.C., for briefings about the disaster.\n\nShe's planning to address voters in the Fox Valley on Thursday, according to an advisory to voters from Wisconsin Democrats.\n\nThe visit would be Harris' fifth to Wisconsin since she became the Democrats' presidential nominee in late July. The Harris campaign early Tuesday declined to comment on her travel plans, and a spokesman for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin didn't respond to a message about the advisory.\n\n\u2014 Mary Spicuzza\n\nTrump crowd count at 500 indoors, 4,500 outside\n\nAccording to a spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, the Dane Manufacturing facility held 500 people ahead of Trump's remarks, while about 4,500 stood outside the building.\n\n\u2014 Jessie Opoien\n\nWalker, Thompson encourage '72-county strategy' for Trump in Wisconsin\n\nWalker and Thompson greeted the crowd at Dane Manufacturing ahead of Trump's remarks, each stressing the need for Republicans to cut into the strong Democratic margins in Dane and Milwaukee counties.\n\n\"You need to go beyond your comfort zone. You need to talk to family and friends, neighbors and coworkers, including some who maybe don\u2019t typically vote for a Republican,\" Walker said. \"Remind them ... this simple truth. Life was better when Donald Trump was president of the United States.\"\n\nWalker argued that any distaste for Trump's rhetoric is negated by his approach to the economy, the border and violent crime.\n\nThompson, in a rousing speech, reiterated his insistence that Trump can win Wisconsin by increasing his vote share in the state's two most liberal counties.\n\n\"You have to go where the votes are. You have to go where the opposition is. You have to come into Dane County, Milwaukee County and southwestern Wisconsin,\" he said. \"Dane County has the third-most Republican votes in the state of Wisconsin, and all we have to do is increase them.\"\n\n\"Democrats,\" he said, \"get the hell out of our way.\"\n\n\u2014 Jessie Opoien\n\nGov. Tony Evers criticizes Trump's visits\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday morning, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said, \"I know Wisconsin families, and they\u2019re going to reject (Trump) again in November.\"\n\n\"As president, Donald Trump was a disaster for Wisconsin, and we haven\u2019t forgotten. A second term would be a heck of a lot worse \u2014 Trump\u2019s extreme Project 2025 agenda would hurt working families, cut Social Security and Medicare, dismantle support for public education across the country and more,\" Evers said. \"Vice President Harris is the only candidate in this race fighting to lower costs, cut taxes and invest in Wisconsin\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump campaign releases statement on Emhoff visit\n\nIn a statement, Wisconsin press secretary for Trump's campaign, Jacob Fischer, said \"no visit from Doug Emhoff can conceal the reality that the dangerously liberal Harris-Walz agenda will be one that Wisconsinites simply can't afford.\"\n\n\"Emhoff has stood on the sidelines for four years of failure, and it's time to retire his second gentleman title. President Trump and JD Vance will lower taxes, empower our businesses and put hard-working Americans first, while Harris and Walz advance dangerously liberal policies and bankrupt our country,\" Fischer said.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nFormer Gov. Tommy Thompson 'so happy' Trump is competing in Dane County\n\nThompson told reporters at Trump's event in Waunakee he's \"so happy\" the former president honored his request to visit Dane County.\n\nIn an interview last month on WISN-TV's \"Upfront,\" Thompson said he told Trump during his August rally in La Crosse that to win Wisconsin, he'll have to compete in the liberal strongholds of Dane and Milwaukee counties \u2014 areas that have rarely been a focus for Republican candidates.\n\nThompson, the state's longest-serving governor, told reporters Tuesday that by campaigning in both counties in one day, the former president will send a message that: \"I want your vote. I'm here in Dane County because I\u2019m going to compete for your votes all over the state of Wisconsin.\"\n\nTrump lost the village of Waunakee by 28 points in 2020 \u2014 about half his losing margin countywide.\n\n\u2014 Jessie Opoien\n\nWhere is Waunakee, Wisconsin, the site of Trump's visit?\n\nWaunakee is about 13 miles north of Madison. It's in the northern part of Dane County, a county that produces large Democratic margins that present headaches for Republicans.\n\nIn 2020, Trump lost the village of Waunakee by 28 points, about half his losing margin in the county. Waunakee has a population of about 15,000.\n\nEric Hovde, the Republican candidate for Senate running against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, also visited Dane Manufacturing in Waunakee in September, where he took questions from employees.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nDiscovery World has hosted Harris, Vance and now Trump\n\nTrump's appearance in Milwaukee Tuesday will take place at Discovery World, a science museum that juts out into Lake Michigan. The museum's current facility was built in 2006.\n\nDuring the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump's running mate and Ohio U.S. Sen. JD Vance spoke at Discovery World at an event sponsored by the Log Cabin Republicans, a pro-LGBTQ group.\n\nHarris also spoke at Discovery World in May, before she became the Democratic presidential nominee. During that visit, she focused on the economy and disparities that affect Black homeowners and business owners.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nMore:From admission cost to hours to exhibits, here's what to know before a Discovery World visit\n\nTrump to make his first Dane County campaign stop\n\nHundreds of supporters are lined up outside Dane Manufacturing in Waunakee awaiting a visit from Trump. His remarks are scheduled for 1:30 p.m.\n\nIt's Trump's first campaign event in Dane County, Wisconsin's fastest-growing county and a Democratic stronghold. Biden led Trump by more than 181,000 votes in the county when he defeated him statewide by about 21,000 votes in 2020. In Waunakee, Biden led Trump by about 2,600 votes.\n\nDane Manufacturing has served as a friendly space for Republican candidates in the liberal region. Hovde toured the metal fabrication facility and fielded questions from employees about a month ago, and Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz did the same at the company's former location during his 2016 presidential bid. Cruz, who now backs Trump, at the 2016 stop referred to him as a \"sniveling coward.\"\n\nIn his Tuesday speeches, Trump is expected to criticize the current Democratic administration's economic policy.\n\n\"When Wisconsinites send President Trump back to the White House, he will lower input costs for our farmers, cut 10 regulations for each new regulation implemented, and help, not hurt, farmers\u2019 ability to feed the world,\" the Trump campaign said in a news release promoting the campaign events.\n\n\"While Kamala Harris desperately tries to run from her four years of failure for farmers, workers, and families across the state, Wisconsinites know that only President Trump can Make America Wealthy, Safe, Strong, and Great Again,\" the news release said.\n\n\u2014 Jessie Opoien\n\nHarris planning Fox Valley campaign stop Thursday in Wisconsin\n\nHarris will be returning to Wisconsin on Thursday to rally voters in the Fox Valley. The campaign hasn't yet confirmed her travel plans, but a Wisconsin Democrats advisory with a registration link went out to voters.\n\nHarris was last in Wisconsin in late September for a rally in Madison. The Fox Valley visit would be Harris' first to northeastern Wisconsin. Trump rallied in Green Bay in April for his first campaign stop of 2024, and running mate JD Vance was in De Pere recently.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nWhat do the latest Trump-Harris polls show in Wisconsin?\n\nA new Marquette University Law School poll of Wisconsin voters will be released Wednesday afternoon, right in the middle of this week of campaign visits. The poll is considered one of the highest-quality surveys in the country.\n\nThe last poll, conducted between Aug. 28 and Sept. 5, showed Harris with a four-point lead over Trump. That was within the margin of error, as have been most Marquette polls this year in battleground Wisconsin.\n\nThe last poll also showed an important switch for Harris: For the first time, she led among voters who consider themselves \"very enthusiastic\" to vote. Harris closed an enthusiasm gap that presented problems for Biden, then pulled ahead of Trump in the latest poll.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nAbout 462,000 absentee ballots have been requested in Wisconsin\n\nElection Day is Nov. 5, but voting is well underway in Wisconsin. According to Sept. 30 data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission, 461,704 voters have requested mail-in absentee ballots. About 87,000 of them have been returned by voters.\n\nEarly voting, which provides an opportunity to cast an absentee ballot at an in-person location, runs from Oct. 22 to Nov. 3 in Wisconsin. It's up to each city, town or village to decide how many dates, times and locations to offer.\n\nYou can register to vote, request an absentee ballot, look up what's on your ballot, find your polling place and more at myvote.wi.gov.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp"

It inhabits the \"Goldilocks zone\" around its star, meaning that liquid water (and potentially life) could exist there. A recent analysis with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) supports the idea that the exoplanet may have its own liquid water ocean \u2014 and that the ocean may be home to living creatures . In the study, JWST detected possible traces of dimethyl sulfide, a chemical known to be emitted only by phytoplankton on Earth, in the exoplanet's atmosphere.\n\nThe real-world \"Tatooine\"\n\n(Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nLuke Skywalker would feel right at home on Kepler-16b .

However, because this huge planet has a gassy surface similar to Saturn's, even a Jedi would have a hard time finding their footing on this exoplanet, which is located about 200 light-years from the sun.\n\nThe rule-breaking behemoth\n\n(Image credit: Penn State)\n\nThe giant exoplanet LHS 3154b has scientists scratching their heads, because it seems far too large for its tiny star. This planet, which is about 13 times more massive than Earth but orbits a star nine times less massive than the sun, doesn't seem like it could exist, researchers said upon its discovery in 2023. Future studies of this \"impossible\" world could upend the known rules of planet formation.\n\nThe largest exoplanet in the known universe?\n\n(Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nWith twice the radius of Jupiter, the exoplanet HAT-P-67 b may be the largest known planet in the universe , in terms of width. But despite its monumental girth, there are more massive worlds out there. This honkin' world, located about 1,200 light-years from Earth, has a very low density, giving it only about one-third the mass of Jupiter.\n\nThe \"fluffy\" planet where it rains sand\n\n(Image credit: Illustration: LUCA School of Arts, Belgium/ Klaas Verpoest (visuals), Johan Van Looveren (typography). Science: Achr\u00e8ne Dyrek (CEA and Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9, France), Michiel Min (SRON, the Netherlands), Leen Decin (KU Leuven, Belgium) / European MIRI EXO GTO team / ESA / NASA)\n\nLocated 200 light-years from Earth, the exoplanet WASP-107b also has a very low density, making it appear \"fluffy\" in telescope observations. A recent JWST study of the planet revealed clouds potentially made of fine-grained silicate particles, meaning it may literally rain sand on this puffed-up world.\n\nThe \"eyeball planet\" with potentially living seas\n\n(Image credit: BENOIT GOUGEON, UNIVERSIT\u00c9 DE MONTR\u00c9AL)\n\nSitting just 50 light-years from Earth, the beady-eyed exoplanet LHS 1140 b may be a candidate for alien life thanks to its one-of-a-kind surface. Scientists studying the world with JWST found that the planet may be covered in ice \u2014 except for the one part of its surface that permanently points toward its host star. Here, the star's heat may melt just enough ice for a circular, liquid water ocean to form, according to the researchers. Besides giving the planet a distinct bull's-eye appearance, this rare ocean may be a prime place for extraterrestrial life to flourish, the team wrote.\n\nThe rotten-egg world\n\n(Image credit: Roberto Molar Candanosa/Johns Hopkins Univeristy)\n\nThe exoplanet HD 189733 b , located about 64 light-years from Earth, has a chemical composition so distinct that astronomers can practically smell it from across the galaxy. A recent JWST study of the planet found that its atmosphere contains significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide \u2014 a toxic and flammable gas given off by decaying organic matter and volcanoes on Earth \u2014 which smells like rotten eggs. The smelly egg planet is far too hot for life to exist (thank goodness), but the mere fact that scientists can detect such distinct molecules in its atmosphere is a good sign that JWST may soon be able to detect signatures of life elsewhere in the universe.\n\nThe \"Vulcan planet\" that may not exist\n\n(Image credit: NASA/Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nIn a remarkable case of science fiction reflected in reality, scientists have reported the discovery of a planet similar to Vulcan, the home world of Dr. Spock in the Star Trek franchise. The planet was discovered in 2018 around the real star 40 Eridani A \u2014 the very same star that hosts Spock's home planet in the famous sci-fi series. However, recent follow-up observations of the star have called the planet's existence into question; subtle wobbles in the star's light signature may result not from a nearby planet's tugging on it but rather from regular eruptions on the star's surface. The existence of the Vulcan planet, named HD 26965 b, now seems in doubt.\n\nThe Earth-like planet around a small, red star\n\n(Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nEarth may have a long-lost twin in a nearby star system. Named Gliese 12 b , the planet orbits a hot, red star in a system roughly 40 light-years from Earth. Remarkably, the exoplanet appears to have a width 1.1 times that of Earth, giving it similar properties to our own planet. And while Gliese 12 b orbits its home star much more closely than our planet does the sun (one year there lasts about 13 Earth days), that star is also much smaller, keeping the planet in the habitable zone where liquid water can form on the planet's surface. That means our distant twin may even have its own version of life.\n\nThe Earth-size planet with eternal night\n\n(Image credit: Lionel Garcia)\n\nNot all Earth-size planets are lucky enough to be habitable. Take SPECULOOS-3 b, a rocky, Earth-like world whose orbit around its red dwarf star is a little too close for comfort. Completing an orbit every 17 hours, the rocky world is exposed to so much radiation that its atmosphere was likely blasted away long ago, leaving the unlucky planet totally barren. The roasting temperatures aren't a global phenomenon, however; this planet is tidally locked, meaning one side always faces its star in eternal day, while the other side sits in perpetual night.\n\nThe red volcano world that's \"melting from within\"\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Dani Player)\n\nAstronomers have discovered a planet in a distant star system that appears to be erupting with so many volcanoes, the world literally glows red when seen through telescopes. The smoldering exoplanet, named TOI-6713.01 , is located roughly 66 light-years from Earth and orbits its star closely, completing a loop every 2.2 Earth days. Observations suggest the planet is covered in molten lava, released by hundreds of active volcanoes. The planet is also subject to incredible internal friction from the gravity of its star and its neighboring planets, which may be causing the world to literally melt from within.\n\nThe gas giant with bullet-like wind\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Ralf Crawford (STScI))\n\nScientists have mapped the weather on an enormous exoplanet 280 light-years from Earth, and the forecast looks grim. The planet, named WASP-43b , is tidally locked, with one massive face always pointing toward its star and the other cloaked in eternal darkness. Significant temperature differences between the two sides drive fierce winds, which scientists estimated to blow at up to 5,600 mph (9,000 km/h) \u2014 several times faster than a speeding bullet.\n\nThe hellish world with glorious rainbows\n\n(Image credit: ESA)\n\nThe exoplanet WASP-76 b \u2014 located about 637 light-years from Earth \u2014 is not the type of place you'd want to vacation. Orbiting 20 times closer to its home star than Mercury orbits the sun, the planet's dayside is estimated to reach 4,350 degrees Fahrenheit (2,400 degrees Celsius), making it a true hell world. There is one draw, however: A strange bright spot observed on the planet's surface, right where the day and night sides meet, could be a \"glory\" \u2014 a rare visual phenomenon, sometimes seen on Earth, made up of concentric rainbow rings forming a giant circle.\n\nThe giant planets orbiting dead stars\n\n(Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nOne day, the sun will die \u2014 but some planets in our solar system may live on. Scientists made this inference after discovering two enormous planets orbiting \"dead\" white dwarf stars in distant star systems. Named WD 1202-232 and WD 2105-82 , the planets are estimated to be between one and seven times as massive as Jupiter, and both orbit small, dead stars at distances of at least 11.5 times that between Earth and the sun. Their discovery, if confirmed, hints that our solar system's comparable planets, Jupiter and Saturn, may be able to survive the inevitable death of the sun one day. (Earth, sadly, is likely to be swallowed up during our star's final expansion.)\n\nThe \"rogue\" planets of Orion\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA / Science leads and image processing: M. McCaughrean, S. Pearson, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO)\n\nMost known planets orbit stars, but there may be countless others that don't. Scientists using the JWST have discovered hundreds of free-floating \"rogue planets\" zooming through the Orion Nebula, untethered to any star. Strangely, about 80 of these rogue worlds are trapped in binary orbits with each other, tumbling through space in pairs. Scientists are not certain how these worlds got ejected from their home star systems or why they are trapped in binary orbits. Given that these planets are roughly as massive as Jupiter, scientists have dubbed them Jupiter-mass binary objects \u2014 or JuMBOs, for short.\n\nThe distant planet we can actually see\n\n(Image credit: ESO)\n\nScientists detect most exoplanets indirectly, by watching changes in the light emitted by distant stars. But in 2004, researchers got direct visual confirmation of an alien world for the first time ever. Called 2M1207b, the exoplanet is located about 170 light-years away, in the constellation Centaurus, and is a gas giant about five times more massive than Jupiter. The team spotted the distant world by looking at it in three different infrared wave bands, which helped reveal the planet's heat while blocking the light of its home star. Since this groundbreaking discovery, roughly 200 exoplanets have been discovered through direct imaging, while more than 5,000 others have been revealed through other means.\n\nThe planet with clouds of quartz\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, and R. Crawford (STScI))\n\nCan you imagine a sunset filtered through a crystal sky? That may be a reality on the exoplanet WASP-17b , a Jupiter-like gas giant that's so hot that its clouds are made of quartz crystals, observations with JWST suggest. The planet orbits extremely close to its home star, giving it an atmosphere with temperatures reaching a blistering 2,700 F (1,500 C). This heat forms tiny, sand-size silica particles in the planet's atmosphere, which may coalesce into clouds of pure quartz, researchers suggest.\n\nThe baby Jupiter about to be born\n\n(Image credit: ESO/ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO)/Weber et al.)\n\nExoplanet-hunting scientists zoom in on not just existing worlds but also worlds that are about to be born . While studying the region around the star V960 Mon, located about 5,000 light-years from Earth, scientists spotted a clumpy field of gas where two tendrils of material are apparently being funneled into distinct, planet-like lumps. According to the researchers, who made the discovery using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, this is the first time scientists have imaged a young star system on the verge of birthing its first giant planets.\n\nThe sibling planets dancing in lockstep\n\n(Image credit: ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO)/Balsalobre-Ruza et al.)\n\nAround the distant star PDS 70, located 370 light-years from Earth, resides an incredibly rare pair of sibling planets . One fully formed world roughly the size of Jupiter appears to swirl around its host star; behind it, in the same orbit, is an enormous cloud of gas and dust that researchers suspect may be the planet's partially formed sibling. Although only one of the objects seems to be a full-fledged planet, the pair is the first evidence of rare \"Trojan planets\" \u2014 two worlds that formed at nearly the same time, in roughly the same place around their home star, moving in the exact same orbit.\n\nThe planet turning its star into a \"spiral galaxy\"\n\n(Image credit: ESO)\n\nAbout 500 million light-years from Earth is a star system that looks suspiciously familiar. Wrapped in two dusty spiral arms , it resembles our own Milky Way galaxy \u2014 although on a much, much smaller scale. The reason for this star's galactic appearance? Astronomers suspect it's because of a hidden, Jupiter-size planet dubbed MWC 758 c, which used its massive gravitational pull to sculpt the star's sheath of dust into spectacular spiral arms. The planet has yet to be fully confirmed, but simulations show it's a likely cause of its home star's odd look.\n\nThe mirror world that shouldn't exist\n\n(Image credit: ESA/Cheops)\n\nMost planets reflect at least a bit of their home star's light. But the exoplanet LTT9779 b reflects a whopping 80% of its star's incoming rays \u2014 the highest reflectiveness of any planet ever discovered. The key to the planet's impressive albedo is a layer of metallic clouds that surrounds it. Scientists suspect the Neptune-size world's sky is mostly full of silicate, or glass, and titanate, a salt containing titanium \u2014 turning the planet's atmosphere into a veritable mirror. The planet's existence poses a puzzle for scientists: The world orbits so closely to its star that its atmosphere should have been blown away by now. The key to its survival may be the metal in the planet's skies, which may be too heavy for solar wind to blast it away.\n\nThe \"zombie\" planet that survived its star's death\n\n(Image credit: W. M. Keck Observatory/Adam Makarenko)\n\nThe exoplanet 8 Ursae Minoris b , also known as Halla, is a hot, Jupiter-like world located 520 light-years from Earth. Observations suggest the massive world should have been completely incinerated by its home star, which has already entered its red giant phase and appears to have long since ballooned outward into its system, scorching everything in its path, before shrinking back to its current size. The fact that Halla orbits relatively close to the star suggests it was either born after the star shrank again or the star that's visible today is one of two binary stars that merged, preventing either one from expanding on its path of destruction.\n\nThe water world with a steam atmosphere\n\n(Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC))\n\nThe exoplanet GJ 1214b is located just 40 light-years from Earth, but it's coated in so many thick clouds that scientists had a hard time studying it until recently. Using JWST's infrared vision to peer through the clouds, scientists analyzed the planet and saw what appeared to be an atmosphere made of steam, suggesting the world below may contain significant amounts of water.\n\nThe Earth-like planet with no atmosphere\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, J. Olmsted (STScI))\n\nAround the distant star TRAPPIST-1, seven rocky, Earth-size planets swirl through the star's habitable zone. Whether any of these planets contain the right conditions for life is a question astronomers are eagerly investigating. But one of them, TRAPPIST-1b , may be officially out of the running. JWST's observations of the rocky, Earth-like world reveal that the planet is about as hot as an oven \u2014 a whopping 450 F (232 C) \u2014 and almost certainly doesn't have an atmosphere. Some of the scorching world's neighbors may be better positioned for life to emerge, but more research is needed to know for sure.\n\nThe extraterrestrial sandstorm planet\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI))\n\nScientists using JWST have spotted a gargantuan sandstorm raging on the exoplanet VHS 1256 b , located roughly 40 light-years from Earth. An enormous world that's far from its star, the \"super-Jupiter\" takes about 10,000 years to complete a single orbit. That large distance means scientists can see the planet's atmosphere relatively clearly, without too much starlight getting in the way. Recent observations showed incredibly hot clouds made of silicate particles swirling through the planet's atmosphere. According to the researchers, this may be evidence of a gargantuan dust storm.\n\nThe planet hotter than a star\n\n(Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nKELT-9b is an extremely hot, Jupiter-like planet located 670 light-years from Earth. With an estimated surface temperature of 7,800 F (4,300 C), it was deemed the hottest exoplanet ever discovered upon its detection and is even hotter than some stars. This intense heat has a nasty impact on the planet's atmosphere: On KELT-9b's dayside, the heat of the nearby star beats down so intensely that hydrogen molecules in KELT-9b's atmosphere are literally ripped to shreds and blown across the planet. With one-half of the planet's atmosphere constantly melting, this world is one extraterrestrial destination you'd definitely want to avoid.\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, and J. Olmsted (STScI))\n\nLocated about 900 light-years from Earth, the exoplanet WASP-121b is so hot that heavy metals are constantly boiling through its atmosphere and venting into space. Scientists spotted iron and magnesium molecules so high above the planet's surface that they could escape the pull of gravity and drift away. The extreme heat comes from the planet's ultraclose proximity to its host star. The planet is so close, in fact, that tidal forces generated by the star's gravity have stretched the planet into a football shape that distinguishes it from the spherical worlds most often discovered.\n\nThe ultrasmall world moving at breakneck speed\n\n(Image credit: NASA)\n\nLocated 35 light-years from Earth, L 98-59b is one of the smallest exoplanets ever discovered, with a mass just 0.4 times that of Earth. The tiny world also rockets around its home star at breakneck speed, completing an orbit in just two days, six hours. Because of this, the planet receives roughly 22 times as much energy from its home star as Earth does from the sun, almost certainly rendering the tiny, fast-moving planet uninhabitable.\n\nEarth's \"older cousin\"\n\n(Image credit: NASA)\n\nThe exoplanet Kepler-452 b appears so similar to our home planet that NASA has dubbed the world \"Earth's older cousin.\" The rocky exoplanet orbits a sunlike star at virtually the same distance that our planet orbits the sun, with a year there lasting about 384 days. That puts the planet firmly in the habitable zone, where liquid water could form on its surface. Sadly, our cousin will remain estranged for a good while longer: At nearly 1,800 light-years from Earth, the planet would take at least 30 million years to reach by spacecraft.\n\nThe bizarrely close sibling planets\n\n(Image credit: NASA)\n\nThe exoplanet Kepler-36b is a rocky world that's about 1.5 times the size of Earth and orbits bizarrely close to its neighboring world, the Neptune-like exoplanet Kepler-36c. The two alien worlds make extremely close approaches to each other every 97 days, on average; during those cosmic family reunions, the two planets are separated by less than five Earth-moon distances. These ultraclose encounters exert tremendous tidal forces on the sibling planets, possibly promoting active volcanism on the rocky Kepler-36b.\n\nThe unlucky planet around a toddler star\n\n(Image credit: NASA, ESA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI))"

But what causes air to move in the first place? That is where it gets interesting.\n\nA world without wind\n\nPicture a world that was completely flat and motionless. This world has no changes in elevation, no changes in surface material (land vs. oceans etc). In this theoretical and boring world, the sun would heat each area exactly the same. This would be a world without wind.\n\nRelated: What is dew point?\n\nHow high and low pressure relate to wind\n\nThankfully, Earth is vastly different. We live on a constantly rotating, tilting sphere with large variations in land elevation and vast oceans. The sun heats each of these areas differently and therefore unevenly. This differential heating creates areas of high and low pressure, something we call the pressure gradient force.\n\nAir is constantly flowing from high pressure areas to lower pressure areas in an effort to balance out.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nThe Coriolis Force\n\nAir doesn't flow in a direct line from high to low pressure. Instead it is curved due to something called the Coriolis Force.\n\nThe Coriolis Force is caused by the Earth's rotation, and it directs air to flow clockwise around high pressure and counter-clockwise around low pressure.\n\nAir is also moving in a vertical direction. Areas of high pressure are characterized by sinking air, which tends to warm and lead to sunny, pleasant weather. In low pressure areas, the air rises, cools and condenses into clouds, leading to storms.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere all of those directions are reversed."

        "article_content": "Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], October 1: Gartner Digital Markets\u2013 the world\u2019s largest platform for finding software and services, including Capterra, GetApp, Software Advice, and UpCity\u2013recently convened the Insights Summit in India\u2019s Silicon Valley, Bengaluru, Karnataka, to address the SaaS industry\u2019s pressing challenges. After a year of economic uncertainty, SaaS leaders seek innovative strategies to find efficient growth and secure their place on software buyer shortlists.\n\nThe Insights Summit featured a distinguished panel of speakers from Gartner Digital Markets, including Narayan Adeeb, VP of India Operations; Pit Rissiek, VP of Sales APAC and EMEA; and Saby Khanduja, Senior Sales Manager. Joining them on stage were SaaS leaders Dhivya Venkatesan, Head of Marketing at Sign easy, and Abhigna Kashyap, Senior Director and Global Head of Brand Content, and Social Media at LTI Mindtree.\n\nThe conference theme was \u201cSecuring Your Spot on Buyer Shortlists.\u201d The Insights Summit brought together 68 industry experts and thought leaders to provide actionable insights and best practices for SaaS businesses. Participants learned about the latest software buyer trends, emerging technologies, and effective marketing strategies to drive growth.\n\nThe event featured exclusive research that surveyed 3,500 software buyers and company decision-makers. The study focused on the challenges of software selection, the latest AI trends and buyer preferences, and strategies for software providers to optimise their performance on the Gartner Digital Markets platform. Additionally, participants had the opportunity to network with other India-based SaaS leaders seeking to accelerate their growth.\n\nGartner Digital Markets offers objective research and verified reviews to B2B companies searching for software in India through its Capterra India website. As a comprehensive resource, Capterra India is the country\u2019s go-to destination for software search. Software companies use the Gartner Digital Markets platform to reach active buyers and capture demand in India and worldwide.\n\nKey insights discussed in the Insights Summit included:\n\n* Optimistic SaaS spending is forecasted for 2025: 82% of companies surveyed plan to increase their software spending in 2025. India is the most confident of the countries surveyed, planning to increase its spending by 89%. Top priorities for software purchase are Cybersecurity (37%), IT management (31%), and AI (31%).\n\n* Customer reviews: Customer reviews are buyers\u2019 most influential information source for narrowing their initial purchase options and creating a shortlist of products (41%). Final purchase decisions are made predominantly after product trials (62%) and impressions made by the vendor\u2019s customer support (57%).\n\n* Buyer regret: Over half of companies have experienced regret over a technology purchase in the last year. The more a buyer relies solely on information from a vendor to buy software, the more often they experience regret. This makes it more necessary for vendors to boost their credibility through third parties.\n\n* AI adoption: More than a third of decision-makers plan to assess the value and risk of generative AI. From 2024 to 2025, there has been a 70% increase in organisations anticipating challenges evaluating the value and risk of generative AI.\n\nPit outlined Gartner Digital Markets\u2019 mission to assist software companies in building effective brands through profiles, reviews, and badges. He emphasised capturing in-market demand and gaining insights into market and product sentiment by analysing reviews of your product and competitors.

A new Motorola phone could come with five years of updates, and it represents the second Motorola phone to do so in as many months.\n\nThe recently announced Motorola Moto G75 will come with five Android OS upgrades and six years of security patches. By our count, this would mean that users will be able to update their phone to at least Android 19, considering that the Moto G75 ships with Android 14. Last month, it was announced that the Motorola Edge 50 Neo would include five years of OS upgrades and security patches.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile five years of updates isn\u2019t as many as the seven years that companies like Samsung and Google promise, it still represents a significant increase from what Motorola had previously offered.\n\nMotorola confirms this update guarantee on its product page for the Moto G75, writing: \u201cKeep up with the latest version of Android by getting five OS upgrades \u2014 and six years of security updates \u2014 guaranteed through 2029.\u201d\n\nThe Motorola Moto G75 is a midrange smartphone with impressive features at its price point. It includes a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset, a 6.78-inch Full HD+ LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate, and support for expandable storage via a microSD card of up to 1TB.\n\nThe new phone also boasts a 50-megapixel main primary camera with optical image stabilization (OIS) and Quad Pixel technology and a 5,000mAh battery that supports 30-watt TurboPower wired and 15W wireless charging.\n\nThe new phone is available in Charcoal Gray, Aqua Blue, and Succulent Green. The Charcoal Gray model features a matte-finished back cover, while the Aqua Blue and Succulent Green models have vegan leather rear panels.\n\nIt looks like a very competent budget phone, though the real interest lies in its update policy. This is an area Motorola has long struggled with, and while it remains to be seen if the company actually makes good on this promise, it\u2019s a very encouraging step in the right direction.\n\nMotorola has not yet announced the pricing and availability details for the Moto G75."
