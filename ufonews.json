        "article_content": "There are many reasons that creating a video game can take a long time. It may take a while to land on the mechanics, or to nail the story beats. For big-budget games, the sheer scale of ambition and world building can cause development cycles nearly a decade long, during which shifting audience trends may force a developer to scrap its initial vision.\n\nFor UFO 50, which began its development in 2016, the protracted path to completion is right there in the name: It is not just one video game, but 50.\n\nThere are arcade-style sports games (Bushido Ball, Hot Foot), platformers (Cyber Owls, Mini & Max), puzzle games (Block Koala), deck builders (Party House), role-playing games (Grimstone) and dungeon crawlers (Valbrace). While each \u201980s-style title is not necessarily feature length by modern terms, they\u2019re fully built out, with narratives, multiple levels and multiplayer modes when appropriate."

        "article_content": "Efforts to preserve, spotlight, and celebrate important games of the past have been gaining steam in recent years. Consider, for instance, Digital Eclipse\u2019s Atari 50, a compilation of games from across that company\u2019s history that provides wonderful context in the form of interviews and archival materials, illuminating their colossal impact on gaming. Now, we have another such compilation: UF0 50, a collection of 50 games from UFO Soft, the business-software-maker-turned-game-developer that, across the 1980s, was responsible for dozens of gems which simultaneously reflected the larger gaming trends of the time, while also innovating and pushing the medium forward in their own right. There\u2019s just one small but crucial detail here, however, that sets UFO 50 apart from any other such compilations: UFO Soft never actually existed.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s right, UFO 50 is, for lack of a better term, a \u201cfictional\u201d game compilation, though the games are very real. Here, in their entirety, are 50 games\u2013not minigames, mind you, not little playable demos, but full-length, complete gaming experiences\u2013from a company that never existed. Developers Derek Yu (Spelunky), Jon Perry (Air Land & Sea), and musician Eirik Suhrke (Hotline Miami) spearheaded the project, but they and the other devs actually responsible for the games here are fully committed to the bit. If you beat a game here, it\u2019s the fictional devs of UFO Soft whose names you\u2019ll see on the staff roll. Instead, Yu and the others responsible are listed in the compilation\u2019s opening as \u201cthe UFO 50 Recovery Team.\u201d In this sequence, we see them digging an old gaming computer out of someone\u2019s storage unit and beginning the process of recovering these games for preservation in this collection. \u201cWhenever possible,\u201d we are told, \u201cthe integrity of the original software was preserved.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlaying UFO 50 feels something like being dropped off at your grandparents\u2019 house as a kid and finding that they have an old console you\u2019ve never heard of and a library of games you know nothing about.\n\nThe 50 games here present a picture of a company that, in 1982, took its tentative first step into game development with the challenging and mysterious adventure game Barbuta (\u201cDeveloped secretly on company time, it almost got Thorson Petter fired,\u201d an in-game factoid tells us), and that, by 1989, was producing games like the vibrant, multi-genre Cyber Owls, \u201claunched alongside an original comic book series.\u201d At every step, UFO Soft was both responding to current gaming trends and establishing its own identity, producing games that tried to capitalize on popular new genres and tendencies in game design while also bearing their own distinctive authorship.\n\n\n\nAnd this, in my view, is essential to what makes UFO 50 so fascinating. Often, modern retro games wear their references a little too proudly, containing winking references to games of the past as if to say to you, \u201cWe know you like Classic Game X! We like Classic Game X, too! See, we\u2019re doing that thing you liked back when that game did it!\u201d There\u2019s none of that here in UFO 50. This game believably creates a kind of pocket dimension in which UFO Soft actually existed, creating games that capitalize on the rapidly improving game hardware of the 1980s but that aren\u2019t beholden to what everyone else was doing.\n\n\n\nBarbuta, for instance, feels roughly on par with something you might see on the MSX in the early 80s, while Cyber Owls feels akin to an elaborate blockbuster that might have arrived on the NES in 1989, when developers were figuring out how to make the most of that console\u2019s power. (Similarly, it doesn\u2019t cheat with trends or genres, either. UFO Soft makes a beat-em-up, for instance, but not before beat-em-ups exist.) But this isn\u2019t, thank goodness, a compilation in which you\u2019ll find one-to-one clones of the era\u2019s hits. There isn\u2019t UFO Soft\u2019s take on Super Mario Bros. here, though you\u2019ll certainly see elements from games you know and love, which makes it feel as if UFO Soft was around at that time and in conversation with what the rest of the game development landscape was doing. Sometimes I\u2019d dive into a game and say, \u201cOh, cool, this feels like it\u2019s riffing on Blaster Master,\u201d or \u201cOkay, I can definitely see elements of Space Taxi here,\u201d but these games also always felt distinctive, as if made by people with their own ideas, who wanted to make their own contribution to the medium.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo give you a quick sense of the breadth of what\u2019s on offer here, I\u2019m going to highlight five of the games that have stood out to me most in my time with UFO 50. (Remember, there are 50 games here. I\u2019ve played about ten hours of UFO 50 in all, so to say that I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of what\u2019s available here is an understatement.) The one that\u2019s grabbed me the most right out of the gate is Valbrace, a tough action-RPG released, the game\u2019s fiction would have it, in 1988. I haven\u2019t made it very far yet, but its fusion of twitchy combat and first-person dungeon crawling is immediately appealing, and I\u2019m determined to level up my intrepid adventurer and find out what awaits in the dungeon\u2019s lower levels. It also reminded me of how, in the 1980s, it was always exciting if I equipped some new weapon or armor on a game character and their sprite changed. It\u2019s a little thing but it went a long way toward making the visuals feel more immersive and responsive to me as a player. Valbrace has that, and I felt that same little thrill I felt as a kid when I spotted it for the first time.\n\n\n\nNext, there\u2019s Rail Heist, a fascinating hybrid of real-time and turn-based gameplay with destructible environments in which each stage is a kind of puzzle. Playing as a member of a train-robbing crew in the Old West, you must figure out how to get the money on the locomotive out from under the noses of the lawmen guarding it. It\u2019s simultaneously strategic and kinetic, a real blast.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttactics is a fast-paced real-time tactics game for people like me who often avoid tactics games. Units from two opposing castles march toward each other automatically, but you can frantically grab your own units and slide them into advantageous formations to better withstand and conquer the enemy onslaught.\n\n\n\nPorgy is a gorgeous undersea adventure in which you pilot an adorable little submarine (with eyes!) to find upgrades and solve a mystery. The world is filled with both dangers (giant shark attacks!) and secrets just waiting to be discovered.\n\nFinally, the aforementioned Cyber Owls is a fitting game to close out UFO 50\u2019s chronology. Ostensibly released in 1989 and the \u201cfinal\u201d game in this compilation, Cyber Owls shows the developers at UFO Soft pulling out all the stops to make an elaborate multi-genre hit. The rogue commando group H.A.W.K. has acquired a doomsday weapon, putting the whole world in danger, and naturally, the president calls upon the only heroes who are up to the task of thwarting their deadly plans: the Cyber Owls. Each of the four missions your cadre of elite avian agents must undertake is wholly distinct: one\u2019s a beat-em-up, one\u2019s a Cabal-style shooter, one\u2019s a Metal Gear-esque stealth mission, and one\u2019s a side-scrolling vehicular shmup. What really makes it all work for me, though, is the way that it actually feels like it\u2019s based on a Saturday morning cartoon or comic book. As you progress, you encounter an assortment of villains who easily could have belonged to the rogue\u2019s gallery on a show that fused Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with G.I. Joe, and it feels like the devs gave some real thought to fleshing out this fictional late-80s IP.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, that very brief overview of five of the included games here\u2013just one tenth of the entire library\u2013is wholly inadequate at trying to convey the experience of actually playing UFO 50. For one, there are so many other types of experiences here. There\u2019s a game with Smash T.V.-style arena shooting. There\u2019s a first-person horror adventure game that plays similarly to Shadowgate or Deja Vu. There\u2019s a Japanese-style RPG set in a Wild West world. There\u2019s a strategic deckbuilder of sorts in which you try to have the right assortment of people in your Rolodex to ensure your parties are a rousing success. There\u2019s a wonderfully strange puzzle platformer in which you deliberately sacrifice your character\u2019s lives to create a path for the lives that follow. And so much more. The real point of UFO 50, if it can be said to have one, lies not in any individual game, as great as some of them are, but in the variety and richness of what they offer when collected here.\n\n\n\nPlaying UFO 50 feels something like being dropped off at your grandparents\u2019 house as a kid and finding that they have an old console you\u2019ve never heard of and a library of games you know nothing about. You\u2019re probably not going to love all of them, but that\u2019s actually good, I would argue. UFO 50 would probably be a much safer and more limited collection if it felt calibrated for maximum mainstream appeal; part of what makes it so great is that, while a number of games here may not quite click with you, they will all probably really click with someone, in a way games only can when they take chances and feel like the work of individuals rather than a committee. There\u2019s joy and excitement in the act of exploration and discovery, in encountering something inscrutable and pushing up against it until it starts to click for you. (Pro tip: If you find a game particularly hard to penetrate, just let it sit on the title screen for a minute. There\u2019s a chance that, like many actual games of the era, it will start a demo sequence that at least offers some clue as to how to approach it.)\n\n\n\nAnd while some of these games might have been minor hits today on Steam if they were released independently, UFO 50 is so much more than the sum of its parts. Hopping around from game to game here, playing them alongside each other and in the context of each other, what emerges is not just a collection of fun, inventive, and incredibly varied games that could have been made in the 1980s, but weren\u2019t. This is an ode to innovation and game design itself, a celebration of those visionaries who, in gaming\u2019s early days, had fresh, original ideas and pushed a burgeoning art form to its limits in order to realize them. This is a tribute to the people behind one of the most exciting eras in game history, a time when new genres and new concepts were appearing all the time. And, in that way, it also feels to me like a statement about what matters most in game design. It\u2019s not the biggest budgets or the most polish. It\u2019s creativity and experimentation, a willingness to try new things and keep pushing a young medium forward. With any luck, we\u2019re just getting started.\n\n\n\n."

        "article_content": "UFO 50 review\n\nThe 1980s reimagined as a collection of 50 \"small\" games, ranging from arcade racers to full-blown RPGs. Developer: Derek Yu, Jon Perry, Eirik Suhrke, Paul Hubans, Ojiro Fumoto, Tyriq Plummer\n\nDerek Yu, Jon Perry, Eirik Suhrke, Paul Hubans, Ojiro Fumoto, Tyriq Plummer Publisher: Mossmouth\n\nMossmouth Release: Sept 18th 2024\n\nSept 18th 2024 On: Windows\n\nWindows From: Epic Games, Steam\n\nEpic Games, Steam Price: \u00a3TBA/$TBA/\u20acTBA\n\n\u00a3TBA/$TBA/\u20acTBA Reviewed on: Intel Core-i7-11700F, 16GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, Windows 10\n\nYou can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.\n\nIt's also a funny collection, full of jokes and pranks at the player's expense. In one adventure game, tiles may fall on you without warning within seconds of your first movements. In a puzzle game about a chameleon, birds will slurp you up from inside logs just when you thought you understood the rules of camouflage. One medieval strategy game sees your units advance steadily and automatically forward, desperate to charge, unable to even think of defending. This game is called \"Attactics\"; the title alone a good gag.\n\nThere's also comedy (and satisfaction) in discovering exactly what each of these things is. Barbuta, the \"oldest\" game in the collection, is an unassuming and ancient homebrew Metroidvania that houses glitchy secrets and requires the patience and dedication of a child indoors on a rainy day to make progress. Rail Heist looks like a Sunset Riders-style shooter, but then invites you to play it as an Atari-era Hotline Miami, before you finally realise: \"Hang on, is this... an immersive sim!?\"\n\nVery few of the games give you any instructions, electing instead to just drop you in. It's a common complaint that modern games hold your hand too much, that they over-tutorialise, and fail to trust the player's perseverance or intelligence. So it's refreshing to get 50 games (albeit of varying depth) which implicitly trust the player to \"figure it out\". If your patience or brainpower does run out (and mine did a few times) you can simply eject the cartridge and play something else.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nTo take an example of one of the more compelling oddities, Mooncat is an comically obtuse platformer with some of the most counter-intuitive controls you will encounter this side of 1985. But if you stop and \"zoom out\" of your preconceived notions of what a controller's inputs ought to do, the idea behind it sort of makes sense. All the direction buttons move you left, and all the face buttons move right. Hey, why not? These are games diegetically invented four decades ago, and it's fun to read Mooncat as the product of a time long before each genre's control schemes developed any sense of orthodoxy.\n\nThe whole collection exists in this realm of tension, stretched out like a 40-year-long rubber band. If you squint, you can recognise the games of today between the pixels. Zoldath is a randomly generated explore 'em up set on an alien world where your tools are fuelled by mineral and plant pickups. In other words, it's No Man's Sky but in 1984. Meanwhile, the grid-based laser zappin' of Bug Hunter feels like an NES demake of Into The Breach (and is surprisingly moreish as a result). Velgress is a popcorn platformer that propels you ever higher through fear of decaying platforms. It is like Downwell but going up. That checks out. After all, the designer of Downwell is on the team of (real) developers who made the collection.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\n\"Our goal,\" say this gang, \"is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design.\" In this I'd say they succeed. Many of the games are built on design principles or novel gimmicks that simply wouldn't appear in the shooters and platformers of yore, and it's interesting to see where the creators draw a line in terms of what constitutes modern and \"classic\" game design. (They also inadvertantly make a compilation of games that fit the aesthetics of the \"indie darlings\" era of the 2010s, but probably because, uh, they are those darlings).\n\nThe modern twists are noticeable. Take the concept of \"lives\" for example. Mortol is a platformer in which you are given a generous 20 lives. But then you are expected to spend those lives turning yourself to stone blocks, or repeatedly launching yourself at the wall to create a step-ladder out of your rigid corpses, thus helping your next \"life\" get further into the level. Other modern ideas trickle into the games. You can hold down a button to skip long cinematics, for instance. And at least one game ranks you on a three-star scale at the end of every level, adapting the contemporary practice of mobile games.\n\nAgainst the aesthetics of a pixelated era, such features feel alien, yet weirdly compelling. Imagine watching Humphrey Bogart send a telegram in a 1950s noir, and then text starts appearing on-screen in a WhatsApp speech bubble. Imagine you are enjoying an Akira Kurosawa flick, and suddenly: an unmistakable drone shot. That's what playing UFO 50 is like. It's a compilation of double-takes, a comic provoker of \"huh\"s, an anachronism bonanza.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nIt works well mostly because it is so committed to the framing narrative: that this collection exists as a restoration project. There is a meta story (or maybe a \"meta-history\") to unravel, if you look closely. Each game has its own short developer note. And there's a terminal to enter cheat codes that I suspect will reveal some fun secrets (I didn't crack a single code). Taking it all in at once, the compilation is the story of a hobby's slow professionalisation. Even the menu screens of each game, when taken in chronological order and analysed like individual layers of polar ice, track the changes of their creative pioneers.\n\nEarly games are credited in plain text, made by a trio called \"Petter, Chun & Smolski\". Later games see personal names replaced by a business, \"LX Systems\", and then \"UFO Soft\". Eventually the games start sporting a professionally animated logo, complete with a pretty jingle. All personal calling cards are smoothed away. The enigmatic figure of a developer called Thorson Petter appears in early works, creator of games that are often painful or confounding to play, yet strangely sincere in their own user-agnostic way (guess who made Barbuta and Mooncat). Later, his name seems to disappear.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nOf course, you don't need to engage in any of this. You can just find the 25 games that include local multiplayer and go ballistic with a pal. There is built-in curation too, letting you filter the games broadly by genre. \"Quick play\" and \"reflex play\" cover some arcadey bops, while \"thinky games\" offers up all the puzzles. And even within these filters there exists a little surprise, a special screen for collectors and obsessives. Perhaps this is the time to say that if you subscribe to Retro Gamer and find yourself watching endless YouTube documentaries about the good old days of pixel platforming, then this will undoubtedly tickle you. It also feels purpose-built for students of game design. Any day now UFO 50 will appear in a video by Mark Brown, and people will wonder why they haven't heard of it (it's because you don't read RPS, you rubes!). Ahem.\n\nIf you're not that kind of person - not a retro freak or a game designer yourself - then it's a harder sell. There are games with deceptive depth, engaging enough to grab you by the \"one more turn\" glands. But you'll have to go in knowing that part of the fun is sifting through the pile to find those. I would flip through three or four games about angry football or samurai tennis with lazy channel-surfing curiosity, only for an hour to vanish like Batman on a nerdy dinosaur-worshipping worker placement game (it's called Avianos, it rules). This is part of the schtick. UFO 50 is not just about playing a bunch of small, tightly made games, it's also about chasing the buzz of discovering something that stands out.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nAs someone who has spent years curating games to an audience, I'm conflicted about that. It feels a bit like work. I used to trawl through itch.io every week for a free games column on this very site. I understand both the satisfaction and disinterest that comes from panning for gold dust, even in today's overwhelming gamepocalypse. It's definitely gratifying to rummage through UFO 50 and find an Avianos, a Velgress, a Mortol in the pile. But I also didn't get through all 50 of the games in the collection. I barely scratched half. I don't think I could face mining the entire bundle. (Fun side note: this isn't the first time we've been at the coal face with 50 short games, or even 300 in a pirate kart).\n\nMaybe an unfinished pile is to be expected, though. The internet is a capable devourer, and I look forward to reading user reviews about UFO 50 in a way I don't for many other recent releases. Players will be able to evangelize their favourites, list their unmissables, and get into role-playing flame wars about which game in the Campanella Trilogy was best. Perhaps someone out there will explain why you should not give up on the opaque works of Thorson Petter. That would be swell. I don't want to complete Mooncat, that baffling platformer, but I do want to watch the 20-minute retrospective from the bearded 50-year-old who has."

M&A deals in the category have been bustling over the past 12 months as traditional ad agencies like Publicis Groupe and Stagwell have similarly added influencer startups to their company portfolios. Stagwell specifically called out Leaders' AI tech in its announcement around the deal.\n\nFounded in 2008 as an agency for more traditional media talent, Montreal-based Dulcedo Group has recently been on a buying spree, announcing in November it acquired creator talent agency Influence+All and PR firm Sundae Creative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNode began looking for a buyer in 2023 after it needed cash and ran into a challenging fundraising environment. It shrunk its company headcount to four staffers and hoped that joining a larger agency could help it win deals with bigger brands.\n\n\"We realized that agencies are the gatekeepers,\" D\u00e9rival said. \"We would rather join them and help them with technology and that would help us with monetization and provide value for our investors.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe cofounders ultimately connected with Dulcedo Group, which put in an offer to acquire Node. Dulcedo Group was drawn to the company's technological expertise and roster of micro influencers, Faraji told BI.\n\n\"A lot of agencies are actually acquiring technology from a defensive position,\" Faraji said. \"They're doing it because they are either losing customers to an influencer platform that's a tech startup, or their customers are coming to them and saying, 'Hey, do you guys have any technology? The way you're collecting data or the way that you're running these campaigns is inefficient,'\" he said. \"What drew us towards Dulcedo is that they're actually making acquisitions so that they can be offensive, not defensive. It's not just about protecting market share with them, it's about expanding market share and also addressing new customer segments within the creator economy.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne area of focus for Node post-acquisition is AI. The company said it's developing AI tools to improve social listening and data analysis, and streamlining the process of identifying new talent to work with.\n\n\"AI automates the manual labor when it comes to influencer marketing,\" Faraji said. \"At the end of the day, relationships still rule the industry. Agencies will work with creators that they have relationships with, and creators will make compromises to work with agencies and brands that they love.\""

        "article_content": "The acquisition marks a pivotal step in realizing the group's long-term vision of becoming a leading force in the booming creator economy through AI adoption and tech-driven innovation.\n\nMONTREAL, Sept. 18, 2024 /CNW/ - Dulcedo Group, an award-winning talent management agency headquartered in Montreal, announces the successful acquisition of Node App, an AI-powered influencer marketing platform. Node App was created to democratize the creator economy and make influencer marketing more accessible by offering actionable, scalable solutions to long-standing challenges faced by creators, talent agents, brands, and agencies.\n\nDulcedo Group Acquires AI-Powered Influencer Marketing Startup Node App (CNW Group/Node)\n\nThis acquisition marks the beginning of an emerging trend in the creator economy, where agencies bring technology in-house to become active participants. Dulcedo's acquisition of Node solidifies its commitment to the space and provides a springboard for offering unique, AI-powered experiences to its clients, influencers, and other agency partners.\n\nNode's technology has enabled over 2,000 companies across North America to generate tens of millions of social media impressions by matching them with micro-influencers. The platform has served companies like Kraft, Samsonite, Jarritos, St-Regis, Marriott, and more. Additionally, it has empowered over 5,000 content creators to build sustainable income streams through brand partnerships and monetization opportunities.\n\nNode App, founded in 2019 by Armin Faraji and Mackenzie D\u00e9rival, was initially focused on restaurants, but soon expanded to include e-commerce brands. During the pandemic, Node showed significant traction, scaling from 30 to 800 brands in just five months. This performance led to a successful $1 million funding round, attracting notable investors such as Techstars, Alchemist, and early executives and C-suite members from Shopify, Shutterstock, Hershey's, and Intuit.\n\nDulcedo's acquisition of Node marks an important milestone, providing Node with additional funding and resources to enhance its growth and operational efficiency. Over the past decade, Dulcedo has established itself as a leading agency, working with thousands of A-list models, elite athletes, actors, and social media influencers. As a result of this acquisition, Node will gain access to Dulcedo's extensive network, with a combined following of over 300 million. This acquisition grants Node access to Dulcedo's impressive roster, which includes American actor Javon Walton, Olympic Gold Medalists Karen Chen, Max Parrot, and Sarah Nurse, and two-time Stanley Cup winner Alex Killorn, ensuring comprehensive coverage across all industries involved in influencer marketing campaigns.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Node's innovative approach and rapid growth in the digital landscape make it a perfect fit for our vision. By integrating Node into Dulcedo Group, we can leverage our resources to drive even greater success and expand our influence across new and existing markets,\" says Karim S. Leduc, CEO of Dulcedo and Interim CEO of Node App.\n\nIn 2022, Google selected Node for its Google for Startups Accelerator program. This partnership enabled Node to enhance its AI capabilities through access to Google's computing resources and expert mentorship. As a result, Node pioneered a machine-learning technology set to revolutionize agency workflows by improving influencer discovery and data reporting. With Dulcedo's strategic investment and vast resources, Node will accelerate the development of AI-enabled tools to enhance the entire influencer marketing campaign lifecycle.\n\n\"Dulcedo's proven track record, deep industry connections, and commitment to creators make them the ideal partner for Node's next chapter. This strategic move allows us to supercharge our platform's capabilities, deliver even greater value to our clients, and tackle the influencer economy's biggest challenges head-on,\" says Armin Faraji, COO of Node.\n\nCEO of Dulcedo Group, Karim Leduc will assume the role of Interim CEO of Node, with co-founder Armin Faraji moving into the position of COO, and co-founder Mackenzie D\u00e9rival remaining as CPO.\n\nAbout Dulcedo:\n\nCo-founded in 2008 by Karim S. Leduc in Montr\u00e9al, Dulcedo Management Group is a global multi-disciplinary talent management agency with a head office in Montr\u00e9al and an office in Toronto with a talent roster from all over the world.

The move happened shortly after a curious incident with her father in which he was unresponsive or frozen in time for several minutes while reading the newspaper one Sunday morning.\n\nHewins said her father told the family that they had to move to Bridgewater \u201cbecause God told him to.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Hewins described her paranormal experiences and encounters, or \u201cvisits,\u201d from extraterrestrials that she has experienced along with her twin sister, Audrey Hewins, as far back as they both can remember.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would tell my parents I was afraid to go to bed. I was afraid the bald men were going to get me,\u201d Hewins said. \u201cI was seeing all sorts of things behind the veil that people don\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nLiving near the Hockomock Swamp and the Freetown-Fall River State Forest, sites where many strange occurrences have been reported, only intensified the experiences that the twins were having, Hewins said during the documentary interview.\n\n\u201cWe had the Hockomock swamp pretty much in our backyard,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nShe said there are many different extraterrestrial species that she sees and communicates with, both benevolent and malevolent.\n\n\u201cAll these beings are highly intelligent,\u201d Hewins said. \u201cAnd they know everything about us because they\u2019re telepathic.\u201d\n\nShe described a battle between the dark and the light side of these beings, which she called angels and demons. Hewins eventually realized how to repel the negative beings, by projecting love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery religion has pieces of the truth but, where they are in certain parts of the world, things are different. Things are interpreted differently,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nShe said there is a \u201cspiritual awakening\u201d happening in the world that is being helped along by extraterrestrials.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s falling apart. If somebody doesn\u2019t intervene, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cI do believe this is a global intervention and they\u2019re doing it in steps.\u201d\n\nShortly after moving to Maine in 2006, the Hewins twins founded Starborn Support, a national online support group \u201cto assist and provide emotional support to those who feel they have had an extraterrestrial encounter,\u201d according to the group\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine doing this alone. A lot of people do it. That\u2019s why I started the support group,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nThe group hosts gatherings for \u201cexperiencers,\u201d those who report having a UFO or ET encounter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the interview on Sept. 11, Hewins, filmmaker Tyler Roberts, and film producer Jess Weiner gathered with other experiencers to call on ETs to visit and then watch the sky for UFOs.\n\nThe group saw several bright floating dots that could not be readily identified, but many were suspected satellites moving across the night sky.\n\nAccording to NASA\u2019s website, UFOs can be \u201crocket launches, comets, military jets, weather balloons, sounding rockets, satellites, meteors and fireballs, experimental craft (if you are lucky) and odd clouds (such as lenticular clouds, which are lentil-shaped and resemble flying saucers).\u201d\n\nIn recent years, UFOs, or as the federal government has started referring to them, unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs, have gained mainstream attention with hearings held before the U.S. Congress.\n\nFilmmaker Tyler Roberts grew up in Billerica, which is a part of the triangle and home to what he referred to as the \u201cmost haunted road in Massachusetts.\u201d He feels like he is meant to tell the story he is crafting in his first feature-length film.\n\n\u201cThe more I think the world is black and white, the more gray I see,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also traveled to Bridgewater and Salem, Mass., where he encountered many synchronicities which led him to Hewins.\n\n\u201cThese are things I\u2019m running into, and I can\u2019t ignore them,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s slapping me in the face over and over again, saying \u2018tell the story.\u2019\u201d\n\nRoberts currently hosts a podcast, \u201cTotal Disclosure,\u201d in which he interviews people about UFOs and cover-up conspiracies, including credible sources like retired federal government officials.\n\nThere is a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for post-production expenses on Roberts\u2019 self-funded documentary. The trailer is expected to be released in October, just in time for \u201cspooky season,\u201d he said."

The fossil site is only accessible by helicopter.\n\nOver 90 fossils were found, including teeth belonging to a relative of the T-Rex, teeth belonging to a relative of the Triceratops, bones from a large herbivore, and a foot belonging to a small meat-eater.\n\nFurther analysis, including extracting the fossils from concrete-like rock, is needed, but the findings could potentially mean discovering a species unknown to science.\n\nDinosaurs once roamed parts of BC, and this discovery could help researchers understand more about the specifics of the ones who did.\n\n\u201cThis is truly a remarkable discovery that will not only help us to understand more about the dinosaurs who roamed British Columbia but also highlights the remarkable dedication of this team of researchers,\u201d said Royal BC Museum CEO Tracey Drake.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in checking out the fossils, you\u2019ll have to wait a couple of years, including a visit to Colwood, BC.\n\n\u201cVisitors will have the opportunity to observe the research process through viewing windows into the palaeontology lab at PARC Campus.\u201d\n\nThe Royal BC Museum says that evidence of dinosaurs in BC can even be found on Vancouver Island, the Kootenays and the Peace Region.\n\nYou can read more about dinosaurs in BC here."

These efforts are uniquely supported by Crusoe\u2019s sustainable computing infrastructure, helping ensure that the intensive computational tasks are carried out efficiently and with minimal environmental impact.\n\nThe final phase will involve the creation of a multimodal large language model (LLM) and AI agent, training a 70-billion-parameter Llama 3 model on approximately 200 billion tokens from various battery-related texts and literature. This is enabled by the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform and Supermicro\u2019s high-performance hardware, significantly broadening the scope and accuracy of SES AI\u2019s predictive capabilities. The most promising candidates from this AI-driven analysis will undergo rigorous laboratory testing in SES AI\u2019s Electrolyte Foundry, where the candidates will be synthesized, evaluated in battery cells, and assessed for real-world performance.\n\n\u201cWith access to more NVIDIA GPUs, we expect to map a large enough molecular universe that our AI model training will reach sufficient accuracy. Once we have this map, we believe we can accelerate material discovery for any battery problem. This includes not just Li-Metal for EVs and UAMs, but also Li-ion batteries for consumer electronics, grid storage, automotive, and other applications,\u201d added Hu.\n\nPowering AI for Science with Crusoe\n\nCrusoe\u00ae Cloud is a purpose-built AI-cloud platform that offers the latest NVIDIA GPUs, high-performance networking and storage solutions. Crusoe powers its cloud platform by developing, building, and utilizing a differentiated portfolio of clean energy solutions to minimize the environmental impacts of both energy production and computing.\n\nThis project will leverage Crusoe\u2019s climate-aligned cloud platform, powered by NVIDIA and Supermicro.\n\n\u201cBy collaborating with Crusoe, NVIDIA, and Supermicro, we combine cutting-edge AI with sustainable computing infrastructure to drive breakthroughs in battery innovation. This project embodies our commitment to sustainability and technological advancement,\u201d noted Hu.\n\nStatements from Key Partners\n\nChase Lochmiller, CEO, Crusoe: \u201cCrusoe is dedicated to aligning the future of computing with the future of the climate.
