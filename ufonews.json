        "article_content": "A secretive Pentagon UFO data retrieval program has been hidden from Congressional oversight since 2017, a new report claims.\n\nWhistleblowers assert the program \u2014 codenamed 'Immaculate Constellation' \u2014 was established to 'detect' and 'quarantine' the military's best UFO imagery, as well as its best videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis trove of high quality, multi-sensor UFO data is so tightly held that 'talking about it will put you in the danger zone,' according to a US official who confirmed the leak.\n\nThe quite literally 'above top secret' program allegedly sprang into action in the wake of the 2017 leak of three, still-as-yet unexplained US Navy infrared UFO videos.\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson denied the existence of the program Tuesday evening, telling reporters: 'The Department of Defense has no record, present or historical, of any type of SAP [Special Access Program] called 'IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION.''\n\nA new, allegedly leaked classified report describes an incident in which a swarm of 'orb' UFOs surrounded an F-22 stealth Raptor and forced it off course. Above, a weather balloon careens through the air following its release from the Cape Canaveral weather station in Florida\n\n'Orb' UFOs are said to be the most commonly reported by the US military. Above, a 'metallic orb' UFO - dubbed the 'Mosul orb' - as leaked to documentary filmmaker Jeremy Corbell\n\nBy law, classified programs like SAPs must be disclosed to the so-called 'Gang of Eight,' which includes the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and other key lawmakers.\n\nHowever, the source of the leaked report, who supplied the document to the independent news site Public, described the program as an 'Unacknowledged Special Access Program' or USAP with unique secrecy privileges.\n\nReporting in defense publication Jane's Defense first revealed the existence of USAPs decades ago, showing that government officials were authorized to lie publicly to deny their existence.\n\nPublic's anonymous source alleged that such deceptions were now occurring on the issues of non-human intelligence (NHI) and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).\n\n'The Executive Branch has been managing UAP/NHI issues without Congressional knowledge, oversight, or authorization for some time, quite possibly decades,' this anonymous whistleblower wrote in their report to Congress.\n\nAbove, an excerpt from the January 2000 issue of national security magazine Jane's International Defense Review, in which reporter Bill Sweetman first made public the existence of 'Unacknowledged Special Access Programs' - which officials are told to lie to protect\n\nAbove, another 'metallic orb' UFO - said to be recorded by an MQ-9 Reaper drone in the Mid East - first presented to Congress by Pentagon physicist Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick last year\n\nThe whistleblower who claims to have authored the report to Congress described the 'Immaculate Constellation' USAP as a 'strategic intelligence program' and only one part of how the US military currently deals with its UAP 'problem.'\n\nIf proven to be legitimate, the program would show those now infamous Navy UFO videos \u2014 known as the Tic Tac, GOFAST, and Gimbal \u2014 to be just the tip of the US government's UFO data iceberg.\n\n'The multitude of wavelengths collected by these sensors [...] have captured UAP characteristics that are difficult or impossible to observe with the human eye alone,' according to the leaked report, allegedly intended for cleared members of Congress.\n\n'Subtle atmospheric effects associated with UAPs are also visible through the sensors employed by the US military and intelligence agencies,' the leaked report added.\n\n'The verifiable chain of custody for UAP IMINT [meaning high-quality 'Imagery Intelligence'] collected by US military assets,' the report continues, 'ensures a high level of confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the data gathered.'\n\nThis alleged, leaked classified report to Congress also described an incident in which a swarm of 'orb' UFOs surrounded an F-22 stealth Raptor, forcing it off course.\n\n'The F-22 broke trajectory and attempted to evade,' according to the alleged report, 'but was intercepted and boxed in by approximately 3-6 UAPs.'\n\n'One UAP maneuvered in proximity (>12 meters) to the area directly starboard of the cockpit,' as this whistleblower's report described the pilot testimony.\n\n'There the UAP established a rigid spatial relationship with the F-22, maintaining its exact position and orientation parallel with the F-22's cockpit despite multiple evasive rolls and maneuvers.'\n\nThe new whistleblower report is said to have originated as a document delivered to select members of Congress. Congressman Tim Burchett steps into a 'Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility' or SCIF (above) for a prior classified UFO briefing held on Capitol Hill\n\nThe whistleblower's report is said to make reference not just to UFOs but to 'ARVs' short for 'Alien Reproduction Vehicle' - meaning successfully reverse engineered alien spacecraft. Above, a page from the US Air Force's Project 1794, which was declassified in 2012\n\nThe whistleblower, whose identity is being tightly held for his own safety, according to Public, believes the purpose of the USAP was to hide such amazing encounters.\n\nIn his report to Congress, the source described 'Immaculate Constellation' as 'a means of enforcing internal information security' \u2014 capturing new UFO reports 'before they are observed and circulated within the Military Intelligence Enterprise.'\n\nA second source, a former US intelligence community official, confirmed the authenticity and existence of Immaculate Constellation to Public, stating: 'That program is run out of SEC DEF [Office of the Secretary of Defense].'\n\n'They don't want to acknowledge it's real,' this intelligence source opined. 'They won't comment on it.'\n\nExplosive charges, made by former high-ranking US intelligence official David Grusch (center) in the press and to Congress, have accused both the US military and its defense contractors of stonewalling on evidence of crashed UFOs, recovered 'beings,' and even UFO-related deaths\n\nThis source also noted that the simple public utterance of the name 'Immaculate Constellation' would be sufficient to trigger government surveillance of those who publish it, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n\n'They enforce the secrecy with a lot of vigor,' this second source asserted.\n\nWhile still unproven, the explosive claims surrounding the alleged 'Immaculate Constellation' UFO collection program echo comments made publicly by very senior former US intelligence officials.\n\n'I think some of the phenomena we may be seeing,' ex-CIA head John Brennan told reporters in 2021, 'results from something that we don't yet understand and could involve some type of activity that some might say constitutes a different form of life.'"

        "article_content": "A new documentary about the British Royal Family's interest in UFOs and the paranormal has investigated claims that King Charles flew an actual UFO in Canada in 1975\n\nA new documentary delving into the British Royal Family's fascination with UFOs and otherworldly phenomena explores some rather outlandish allegations, including one that King Charles piloted a genuine UFO in Canada back in 1975.\n\n'The King of UFOs' spotlights an interview with Canadian diver Dan Costello, who asserts he saw the King at the time still the Prince of Wales at the helm as one of three pilots guiding what appeared to be a prototype UFO at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia. Costello maintains that the vehicle was UFO-esque and discharged a bluish ionic flame which singed the earth beneath it, consequently altering the ground cover to grass.\n\nHe suggests that King Charles was positioned at the adjacent HMS Endeavour serving as a helicopter pilot and was summoned for a clandestine endeavour known as Project Serpico. In his eye-opening claim, Costello remarked: \"The craft had dual rotor blades like a helicopter, but it would also just sit and hover in the sky with the blades not on and with no sound of propulsion just a faint crackle of electromagnetism.\n\n\"I don't think it was extra terrestrial but might be technology developed by Nikolai Tesla who had a facility here and now this was being used by the US, Canadian and British Military.\"\n\nImage: BANG Showbiz.) BANG Showbiz.)\n\nMark Christopher Lee, the director of the film, rigorously examined Costello's extraordinary narrative and unearthed supporting information, suggesting that the techno-wizardry in question could be akin to what American military personnel like David Grusch have purportedly encountered firsthand.\n\nLee suggested a tantalising theory, questioning: \"What if what we are all seeing in the sky and thinking are extra-terrestrial spacecraft are actually just a secret highly advanced earthbound technology? What if Prince Charles was involved with this project - does King Charles know the truth about UFOs? If so he should release this truth to the public. We deserve to know! \".\n\nDespite reaching out to the Royal household, Lee has yet to receive a response after writing to King Charles regarding the mysterious 1975 event at Sandy Point. Lee admitted his initial doubts, saying: \"I was quite skeptical about Costello's claims at first but since the film has been released numerous witnesses have come forward to state that they remember this Sandy Point incident and that there were weird craft flying in this area.\"\n\nHe also offered an alternative explanation for another well-known mystery, stating: \"This may also explain the infamous nearby Shag Harbour UFO incident which people have suggested was a UFO - the truth is probably that it was an experimental technology that the US, Canadians and British wanted to keep secret and the UFO alien story was a good cover for this.\"\n\nThe documentary 'The King of UFOs' featuring these revelations is currently available on Amazon, Tubi, Apple, and GAIA.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads."

        "source": "The Punch Newspapers",
        "article_content": "Last weekend, the Lagos State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria instructed the leadership of the Lord\u2019s Chosen Charismatic Revival Ministries to review how its members present testimonies at gatherings. According to a PUNCH newspaper report, the CAN had condemned one of the viral testimonies shared by a church member during the penultimate week. In the said testimony, the unnamed member claimed that an old man appeared to her in the examination hall and gave her answers to some questions. The Lagos CAN Chairman, Bishop Stephen Adegbite, described the testimony as \u2018utter fabrication\u2019.\n\nIn recent times, the Lord\u2019s Chosen church has attracted widespread media attention because of some strange-sounding testimonies emanating from its members. The purported miraculous encounters have become the butt of social media jokes, and skit makers have cashed in on them to create sundry digital content. The phrase \u201cI\u2019m a Chosen\u201d, which is an affirmation of denominational faith and loyalty for the church members, has now become a meme for all sorts of situational comedies.\n\nHowever, I have an entirely different view of the Chosen controversy. I do not believe we should use one large brush to paint all Chosen testimonies as mere imagination. Equally, we are not doing our society any good if the only thing we can make out of a seemingly new phenomenon is farce and parody. A sophisticated society should have various prisms for scrutinizing events and social outbursts.\n\nThere is a high probability that some of these miracles are Unidentified Flying Objects encounters. A UFO is any perceived airborne, submerged, or transmedium phenomenon that cannot be immediately identified or explained. Ufology is the investigation of UFOs by people who believe that they may be of extraordinary origins. In ufology, a close encounter is when a person witnesses a UFO \u2013 or its occupants \u2013 at relatively close range, where the possibility of misidentification is presumably greatly reduced. Some of the Chosen testimonies are apt examples of a close encounter or contact.\n\nFor instance, the testimony that an old man appeared, and gave answers in an exam hall, sounds very much like the \u2018saviour UFO alien\u2019 encounter, whereby supposed angelic beings intervene in the affairs of humans. It is reminiscent of the presently trending UFO encounter story of the American man, Chris Bledsoe, which was published in the best-selling book entitled, \u201cUFO of God: The Extraordinary True Story of Chris Bledsoe\u201d. Bledsoe testified that initially, few people believed his UFO encounter, but the US national intelligence community showed strong interest, followed by emerging pieces of evidence confirming the authenticity of his experience.\n\nFurthermore, there is an ongoing eschatological exegesis around UFOs in the Bible. In fact, there is a theological book, The Bible and Flying Saucers, by a Christian minister, Barry Downing, dedicated to this subject. As Frank Stranges, another minister who is the president of International Evangelism Crusades, puts it, \u201cSome UFOs are gifts from God, angelic visitations sent to improve the lot of humankind.\u201d\n\nIn the Book of Ezekiel, the prophet described a flying disc that came from the north (\u201ca wheel in the middle of a wheel\u201d) and hovered over the land. The color was metallic. Although some translations of the Bible describe the \u2018eyes\u2019 of the apparition, a correct interpretation shows that Ezekiel likened these openings to \u2018windows.\u2019 This wheel was no mere vision, Stranges said in a Los Angeles Times interview.\n\nIt was real. It was God\u2019s work. It was a spaceship. Ezekiel saw something. The children of Israel saw something. When the Jews fleeing Egypt roamed the desert for 40 years, a UFO described as a pillar of fire warmed the multitudes at night with its glow. \u201cAbove them was this giant pillar of fire,\u201d Stranges said. \u201cThis was not a natural phenomenon, this huge spaceship God provided in the wilderness.\u201d\n\nGoing by this analogy, one would hazard the assumption that some of the Lord\u2019s Chosen church testifiers may have seen something in the realms of the paranormal. However because Nigeria is not yet exposed to this arcane knowledge, they do not possess the frame of reference to grasp their experiences or accurately describe them. For example, the testimony where a church member narrated how a flying lion carried him to safety, resonates with the UFO encounter in the Biblical book of Ezekiel, where animal imagery was used to depict apparent machines \u2013 eyes on a wheel for windows on a curved spaceship.\n\nThe testimony goes like this, \u201cBefore you know it, something entered my back, lifted me like an aeroplane. When it reached (my destination), it dropped me\u2026 I tried to look, and I discovered it was a lion. When the lion dropped me, it raised its hand and showed me direction, after that, it waved me, bye bye.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, even in the developed countries of the Western hemisphere, with all their sophistication, there are still many sceptics and unbelievers of the paranormal, UFO encounters to be specific. In fact, the American government kept denying UFO reality while gas-lighting close encounter experiencers, until recently when it declassified its UFO files, and admitted that indeed there are UFOs out there.\n\nThe point is, just the same way Chosen members are being trolled, many Americans were mocked and ridiculed when they came public with their close encounter stories. The difference is that the Nigerian experience is dressed in a religious cloak, while the American experience is more scientific and secular.\n\nI feel compelled to share a YouTube comment by one of such Americans on a broadcast made by popular UFO abductee, Travis Walton, who under the username @shotbyabaldwin1409 wrote \u201cI was abducted at the beginning of the year (2022). There is nothing worse than talking to people and needing someone to understand and having everyone think you\u2019re crazy. It\u2019s such a traumatising event that your entire perception of time is changed and you feel truly crazy. I ended up getting amnesia and losing my ability to talk for almost a month. It changed me for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria is just one country in Africa with such testimonies. Two years ago, a Ugandan Christian minister, Prophet William Ssozi gave an incredible account of how he was physically sucked up into \u2018heaven\u2019 in his car while driving on the expressway in Kampala. He insisted it was not a dream. While driving, his car was lifted in midair. He found himself in a place full of light and abundance and was told it was heaven. Then he met Jesus, who had surgery on his head. Within an instant, he was dropped back to earth but discovered he had spent more than three hours in the UFO in the sky.\n\nInterestingly, this Ugandan testimony sounds like the 1988 UFO encounter in Nullarbor, Australia, involving a family of four. The traumatised mother and three grownup sons narrated how a UFO plucked their car from the road on the Nullabor Plain. The Australian police said they were taking the report seriously after investigating damage to the car, which was covered in an ash-type substance. A truck driver and a car driver also witnessed the bizarre event after being chased by the UFO along the Eyre Highway just inside the Western Australia border.\n\nIt is high time we began a serious inquiry into the UFO phenomenon. Now that the subject has become mainstream, it is sad that we lack the intellectual sophistication to profile our citizens\u2019 paranormal experiences. I ask myself, what if there is a real UFO disturbance here, the way it happened in China in 2010, would we allow panic and mass hysteria to take us hostage, or would we engage calmly and surely like the Chinese?"

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nIf scientists can better understand how they work and how to manipulate them, it could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer.\n\nThe work by Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun is \u201cproving to be fundamentally important for how organisms develop and function,\u201d according to a panel that awarded the prize in Stockholm.\n\nAmbros and Ruvkun were initially interested in genes that control the timing of different genetic developments, ensuring that cell types develop at the right time.\n\nTheir discovery ultimately \u201crevealed a new dimension to gene regulation, essential for all complex life forms,\u201d the panel said.\n\nWhat is the Nobel Prize for?\n\nRNA is best known for carrying instructions for how to make proteins from DNA in the nucleus of the cell to tiny cellular factories that actually build the proteins. MicroRNA does not make proteins, but helps to control what cells are doing, including switching on and off critical genes that make proteins.\n\nLast year\u2019s Nobel for medicine went to scientists who discovered how to manipulate one of those types of RNA, known as messenger RNA or mRNA, now used to make vaccines for COVID-19.\n\nAmbros\u2019 and Ruvkun\u2019s revolutionary discovery was initially made in worms; they set out to identify why some kinds of cells didn\u2019t develop in two mutant strains of worms commonly used as a research model in science.\n\n\u201cTheir groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans,\u201d according to the citation explaining the importance of their work.\n\nThat mechanism has been at work for hundreds of millions of years and has enabled evolution of complex organisms, it said.\n\nAmbros, currently a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, performed the research at Harvard University. Ruvkun\u2019s research was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, where he\u2019s a professor of genetics.\n\nWhy does microRNA matter?\n\nThe study of microRNA has opened up approaches to treating diseases like cancer because it helps regulate how genes work in our cells, said Dr. Claire Fletcher, a lecturer in molecular oncology at Imperial College London.\n\nFletcher said there were two main areas where microRNA could be helpful: in developing drugs to treat diseases and in serving as possible indicators of diseases, by tracking microRNA levels in the body.\n\n\u201cIf we take the example of cancer, we\u2019ll have a particular gene working overtime, it might be mutated and working in overdrive,\u201d said Fletcher. She said scientists might one day be able to use microRNA to stop such effects.\n\nEric Miska, a geneticist at Cambridge University, said the discovery by Ambros and Ruvkun came as a complete surprise, overturning what scientists had long understood about how cells work.\n\nTheir discovery of microRNA shocked many scientists, Miska said, explaining that such small bits of genetic material had never been seen before. The tiny fragments of RNA \u2014 the human genome has at least 800 \u2014 were later found to play critical roles in how our bodies develop.\n\nMiska said there is ongoing work on the role of microRNA in infectious diseases like hepatitis and that it might also be helpful in treating neurological diseases.\n\nFletcher said the most advanced studies to date are reviewing how microRNA approaches might help treat skin cancer, but no drugs have yet been approved. She predicted that might happen in the coming years, adding that most treatments at the moment target cell proteins.\n\n\u201cIf we can intervene at the microRNA level, it opens up a whole new way of us developing medicines,\u201d she said.\n\nHow did Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros react?\n\nThe phone call from the Nobel panel is often a surprise, but there are certain signs that recipients and their families pick up on.\n\n\u201cWell, when a phone rings at 4:30 in the morning. \u2026 It never happens here,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\n\u201cNatasha actually answered it,\u201d Ruvkun added, referring to his wife. \u201cAnd she goes: \u2018He has a Swedish accent.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt took a little longer to rouse Ambros.\n\n\u201cSomebody called my son, who called my wife as my phone was downstairs,\u201d he said.\n\nRuvkun knew immediately the impact the award would have on his life.\n\n\u201cWell, I just kept repeating in my mind, this changes everything because you know, the Nobel is just mythic in how it transforms the life of people who are selected,\u201d Ruvkun said. \u201cThe Nobel Prize is a recognition that\u2019s sort of 100 times as much press and celebration as any other award. So, it\u2019s not part of a continuum. It\u2019s a quantum leap.\u201d\n\nGoing to pick up his award in December will be the third time he has been to a Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm after attending to watch his mentor Robert Horvitz receive the 2002 award and then his buddy Jack Szostak, who won in 2009.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a trip coming up. It will be the third, possibly the best,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\nAmbros said he didn\u2019t expect the award as he felt that the Nobel committee has already singled out RNA in the 2006 prize that went to his friends Andrew Fire and Craig Mello.\n\n\u201cIt represents the recognition of how wonderful and unexpected discoveries come from a curiosity in basic science financed by taxpayer money. It\u2019s a vitally important, probably the most important message, that this investment really pays off,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine went to Hungarian-American Katalin Karik\u00f3 and American Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 that were critical in slowing the pandemic.\n\nThe prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the prize\u2019s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.\n\nNobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on Oct. 14.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify that microRNA helps regulate gene activity, rather than carrying instructions for making proteins.\n\n___\n\nCorder reported from The Hague, Netherlands, Cheng reported from London.

        "article_content": "At the dawn of the 1900s, science remained a domain largely inaccessible to women. Despite societal constraints, a select group of pioneering women found a path to contribute to science through illustration. Drawing was a decidedly \u201cwomanly\u201d pastime in the early 1900s, so illustration became an acceptable avenue for scientifically inclined women to document and interpret the natural world despite the gender bias in traditional scientific roles.\n\nThese are the stories of four women in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Department of Invertebrate Zoology who broke through the gendered barriers of science and made significant contributions to scientific discovery through art.\n\nViolet Dandridge (1878\u20131956)\n\nViolet Dandridge was one of the earliest women employed as an illustrator by the Smithsonian. In 1903, she embarked on expeditions to document invertebrates alongside renowned female scientists Mary Jane Rathbun and Harriet Richardson. Dandridge surveyed the east coast with Rathbun and Richardson to collect and document over 1,000 invertebrate specimens. She meticulously captured their likeness in colored paintings.\n\nDandridge captured the delicate features of a wide variety of animals in crisp detail. These illustrations provided crucial insight for scientists to determine the unique features of each animal. Beyond her pioneering work in science, Dandridge was also an active participant in the woman's suffrage movement.\n\nAime Motter Awl (1887\u20131973)\n\nAime Awl defied societal norms by pursuing a career in medical illustration and later transitioning to the natural sciences. At Johns Hopkins Medical School, Awl studied alongside medical students, observed surgeries, and took advanced anatomy courses. She kept her work secret from friends who she feared would disapprove of such \u201cimproper\u201d work for a woman. Her talent and dedication earned her international recognition, leading to commissions to illustrate rare surgical procedures.\n\nAwl was hired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1929 and not only supported mollusk and crustacean research but also provided illustrations for almost every department in the museum. Her invertebrate work focused on many of the tiniest of animals\u2014such as copepods and ostracods\u2014and was even published in the Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nIn 1944, she joined the Soroptimist Club in Washington, DC, an organization still active today whose volunteers help women and girls gain access to the education and training needed to achieve economic empowerment.\n\nCarolyn Bartlett Gast (1929\u20132015)\n\nCarolyn Gast worked as a scientific illustrator with the Department of Invertebrate Zoology from 1954 to 1985. She used various techniques to capture the essence of invertebrate life. Her illustration of a microscopic loriciferan (featured at the beginning of the article), a new phylum discovered in 1983 by Reinhardt M\u00f8bjerg Kristensen in the microscopic ecosystem between grains of sand, is perhaps her most famous and often reproduced illustration.\n\nHer innovative approach to illustration, including experiments with creating 3D images through stereography, aimed to modernize the field. While stereography never got off the ground for scientific illustration, she worked on it as a personal project and even created a 3D alphabet series in the style of Middle Age Illumination. This artistic style comes from Medieval manuscripts which were decorated with intricate \u201cminiatures\u201d lining the boarders of pages, ornate lettering, and gold leaf.\n\nAs a founding member of the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators in 1968, Gast played a pivotal role in fostering a community of aspiring illustrators. She was also an avid proponent of using art to increase public science literacy.\n\nMarilyn Schotte (1947\u20132020)\n\nMarilyn Schotte dedicated over three decades to the Department of Invertebrate Zoology as both a researcher and illustrator. In addition to supporting the research of Drs. Brian Kensley and Ellen Strong, she published 40 scientific papers and a book of her own on crustaceans.\n\nA dedicated worker, Schotte once spent 24 hours straight drawing larval squid to meet a deadline. Her contributions to science inspired Kensley to name a species of isopod after Schotte (Malacanthura schotteae). Known for her meticulous attention to detail, Schotte's illustrations were praised for their accuracy and depth. She also supported other scientific illustrators by serving as the president of the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators from 1984 to 1988. Her work was featured as part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian Ripley Center in 1996.\n\nIn an era when women faced significant barriers in scientific pursuits, these remarkable individuals contributed to research at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History through meticulously documenting every scale, antenna, spine, and intricate feature of a dizzying array of earth\u2019s animals to help describe life on Earth. Their legacy endures as a testament to the transformative power of art in advancing scientific knowledge and challenging societal norms."

        "article_content": "Jesse Anderson, managing director of the Big Data Institute and author of Data Teams, recently published the latest findings from his annual Data Teams Survey of 81 data leaders and engineers across a range of enterprise types. The 2024 survey shows a slow adoption of LLMs by data teams, a neutral impact from remote work, and an overall decline in the perception of delivered value. The survey also calls out that data-operations capabilities are missing from half of the respondents.\n\nThe Data Teams Survey\u2019s analysis emphasised the importance of spreading skills and cognitive load in the data domain across teams with data science, engineering, and operations capabilities. Anderson wrote that while data science and engineering teams are well-represented, \"operations teams are lacking in half of the respondents.\" Further, he also highlighted inconsistencies in how data teams tend to define the role of operations engineers, with only 20% aligning on a definition which covers systems engineering skills. He wrote:\n\nThe individual contributors must meet the criteria and definitions to represent the job title. We see well-represented responses for data scientists and data engineers with operations lagging.\n\nAnderson also published another article looking at the evolution of results from Data Teams Surveys between 2020 and 2024, in which he commented on the methodologies and practices used by data teams. Anderson wrote that over time he\u2019s seen a \"decline in DataOps and an increase in teams not using a methodology\" of any kind. Anderson wrote that \"choosing a methodology is still essential\" for successful teams.\n\nCommenting on differentiators between high and low-value teams, Anderson wrote that high performers followed \"more best practices.\" The survey showed that these practices include engineering norms such as unit testing, close business collaboration, picking the right technologies, and having appropriate cross-functional skills.\n\nA recent episode of the Data Engineering Podcast discussed the need for increased engineering and operational rigour in data teams with Petr Janda, founder of Synq.io. He started Synq, a data operations reliability and observability platform, following his experience with data teams that measured incident recovery times in weeks, compared to hours for other engineering teams. Janda talked about the need for incident resolution processes which factor in a granular, data specific, impact on stakeholders and downstream systems. Calling out missing processes, he said:\n\nEveryone was focusing on the problem of detecting issues \u2026 So once we detect that a certain table is missing data or that a certain test is now failing because some business validation is not met, what happens afterwards? What is the workflow from the perspective of finding the right team to deal with that issue, and assessing the impact on the company? Is this even an issue we have to deal with right now, or is that something that can wait and be dealt with later?\n\nAnderson also reviewed participants' responses to questions about their teams' delivery of value to the business. Looking back over previous surveys, he observed a downward trend that he said, \"should give everyone in the industry pause.\" Anderson noted that many respondents \"highlighted a disconnect between data teams and business needs.\" This was attributed to insufficient \"domain knowledge\" and issues with \"communicating data value to stakeholders.\" Anderson wrote:\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing this lower value creation trend anecdotally, and now we see it in the data. For a nascent industry like data teams, we should gradually increase the amount of value created or, at a minimum, stay the same. This downward trend has been troubling me for some time \u2026 It is concerning to me that there wasn\u2019t an increase in value creation over three years.\"\n\nOn the subject of remote work, the survey shows that the majority of respondents indicate that remote work has not impacted their team\u2019s productivity. The survey also showed a slow and shallow adoption of LLMs, with only 12% of surveyed teams using LLMs for data processing, which he described as their \"ideal\" use case. After accounting for 24% of teams not using LLMs at all, Anderson explained that the remainder primarily use them \"for code generation, ideation or copy creation, and code debugging.\"\n\nJanda concluded by reflecting on his hope that data teams would become more embedded into organisations\u2019 operational radar, rather than \"seeing data as this thing on the side.\" He also called out the need for more cross-functional skills on data teams, saying:\n\nI hope to see a lot more teams being cross-functional in the way I remember we removed boundaries between frontend and backend and infra teams, by creating cross-functional units."
