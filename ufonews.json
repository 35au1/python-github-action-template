        "article_content": "The charismatic movie star, brought into this Emmy-snubbed but popular series as a marquee name, abandons a hit show responsible for his career rebirth. The next generations of Duttons (played by terrific ensemble Kelly Reilly, Luke Grimes, and Wes Bentley), orphans though they may now be, hope to keep the family traditions alive. There are still rumors , though no studio commitments, that a season six may happen without Costner.\n\nGoodbye, \u201cYellowstone\u201d road. The fifth and final season of Taylor Sheridan\u2019s breakout contemporary neo-western is circling its wagons starting Sunday at 10 p.m. on Paramount. Dutton family patriarch Kevin Costner has already ridden off into the sunset to make his multi-part western \u201cHorizon: An American Saga.\u201d Oops, the premiere flopped . Costner, though talented, has an epic penchant for self-sabotage.\n\nWhat else is coming this week?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find out why,\u201d says \u201cInspector Ellis,\u201d a mantra for motive that underpins whodunits good and bad. The first-rate female-driven British procedural premieres today on Acorn. Striking Sharon D. Clarke plays DCI Ellis, a self-possessed detective-of-few-words-and-big-actions. With assistant DS Harper (Andrew Gower), the experienced pair are the pros from Dover who bigfoot the turf of flailing local cops. In this three-part miniseries, Ellis and Harper investigate a young man\u2019s mysterious death, the suspicious disappearance of a detective that leads to a trail of police corruption, and the disappearance of honeymooners where a severed hand points the way to the crime\u2019s solution.\n\n2. Discovery launches \u201cGame Changers\u201d Tuesday at 9 p.m. The limited series goes back to the dark ages of gaming \u2014 Pong \u2014 at the dawn of Atari and the gaming industry. According to the International Gaming Commission, that modest game of back-and-forth spawned what was to become a $184 billion global video game industry in 2023. The eight-part docu-series charts the pastime\u2019s short history, employing archival footage and talking to creators, investors, experts, and players about the intellectual challenges, backstage dramas, and discovery of new frontiers in gaming. Episode 1 charts the rise of Nintendo, a one-time Japanese family business that began over a century ago making playing cards and evolved into a global entertainment giant.\n\n3. While Alan Cumming may never star as a gladiator in a Ridley Scott sword-and-sandal epic, he has conquered pretty much everything else he\u2019s tried. One-man \u201cMacbeth\u201d on Broadway? Done it. Now, with the five-part \u201cAlan Cumming\u2019s Paradise Homes\u201d airing on BritBox Wednesday, the effusive Scottish star with a love for all things tartan enters the shelter show market. Over five episodes, presenter Cumming pokes through houses that fascinate him. Inspired by his love for architecture and design, and in search of the magical and unique, Cumming prowls dream homes, from a private retreat in Mull with 360-degree views and circling golden eagles, to a renovated barn in Northern Ireland, to a home with a naturalistic style that harmonizes with its Swedish island site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. On Thursday, Amazon Prime continues to expand its international programming, including spinoffs for the \u201cCitadel\u201d spy franchise spearheaded by the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe. The ambitious project known as The Citadel Cinematic Universe heads to India for the action prequel \u201cCitadel: Honey Bunny,\u201d dubbed and in subtitles. Samantha Ruth Prabhu stars as actress Honey, opposite Varun Dhawan\u2019s stuntman Bunny. The Mr. and Mrs. Smith types get swept up in a spy ring where pulling the trigger isn\u2019t just play-acting. Years later, the estranged pair come together again when their past comes calling \u2014 and they must ensure the safety of their daughter Nadia.\n\n5. UFO reporter George Knapp throws down the gauntlet: \u201cWe need to get beyond that obvious question \u2018Are UFO\u2019s real?\u2019 to what really matters. Why are they here, and what do they want from us?\u201d In \u201cInvestigation Alien,\u201d the Netflix series dropping Friday, Knapp goes in search of hard evidence to back up his claims, undeterred by the Pentagon, which only last year declared there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of alien intelligence on earth. Are we alone in the universe or not? Knapp travels the world, highlighting suspicious incidents and interviewing witnesses. The truth is out there, but proof remains Knapp\u2019s holy grail."

        "source": "Windows Latest",
        "article_content": "The LTSC edition of Windows adopts a lean, more stable approach. Windows 11 LTSC is now available with the third-version update, aka 24H2. However, it still maintains the simplistic design approach with the classic version of the system apps and outdated UI. AI, now the most precious thing for Microsoft, isn\u2019t included with Windows 11 LTSC.\n\nWindows Latest installed the latest version of the official Windows 11 LTSC ISO and then put it to test on a PC. The installation is smooth for the most part, except when it asks you to enter a work or school account. Note that Windows 11 LTSC is available for Enterprise users, so you cannot use a personal Microsoft account to set it up.\n\nBypassing the Work/School Account Requirement\n\nWe used a few techniques to bypass the work/school account requirement in Windows 11 LTSC. First, we tried the oobe\\bypassnro command, which used to work in previous versions of Windows 11. But its charm failed to deceive the setup, and we landed on the same page after the automatic restart.\n\nThen, we turned off the internet connection and tried again, but the account requirement page didn\u2019t let us pass. After that, we launched the command prompt using Shift + F10, opened Task Manager, and ended the Microsoft Account process. The screen flashed for a few seconds, and the much-awaited \u201cI don\u2019t have internet\u201d option appeared.\n\nWe proceeded with a local account setup. It didn\u2019t even ask us to set up security questions.\n\nOne thing that we liked about this was that there was no mention of adware, tracking, or promotional items on the OOBE page. It would be best if Microsoft adopted this approach for Windows 11 consumer editions (Pro and Home) as well, but we all know that it won\u2019t improve.\n\nWindows 11 LTSC is clean.\n\nAfter booting to the desktop, at first glance, it doesn\u2019t look like a simple, less-modern version. But when you open the Start menu, the difference becomes clear.\n\nThere are few system apps, unlike the clutter and promotions that you get with consumer editions. Windows 11 LTSC 2024 includes the new Outlook web app by default.\n\nWe checked a few system apps to verify if they have been updated. Most of them look like legacy apps from Windows 7, especially Snipping Tool and Paint. Microsoft is keeping the latest version of both these apps limited to Pro, Home and other editons.\n\n1 of 2\n\nThe new inbox apps multiple new features, like the background remover and layers in Paint and OCR in Snipping Tool.\n\nMicrosoft is making it challenging to customize Windows when the OS is not activated.\n\nIn Windows 11 24H2, most personalization options are locked, and it has patched the existing loopholes. For example, previously, you could apply a dark theme by clicking on the theme box, as shown in the image below. It doesn\u2019t work anymore.\n\nPreviously, some customization was available, but Microsoft really wants you to buy a license. This phenomenon is common in all editions of Windows 11.\n\nWindows 11 LTSC\u2019s File Explorer packs all the latest improvements. You can duplicate tabs; labels appear below commonly used actions, compressions formats support for TAR, and more. But the overall UI doesn\u2019t look as polished as the regular editions.\n\nHowever, LTSC promises a no-nonsense approach that doesn\u2019t overload the OS with newer features. So, users don\u2019t have to accustom themselves to unnecessary apps, design, or UI changes ship with each feature update. It doesn\u2019t include any AI component, so no Copilot app or any other bloatware.\n\nYou can still access Copilot via Edge, which is preinstalled in LTSC.\n\nMicrosoft Store isn\u2019t available, so you\u2019ll have to download the programs from the official sites and wait for updates to improve the system apps. We suggest trying it only if you don\u2019t need feature updates and the bugs that come with it and want a clean OS with a bare minimum of system apps.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of apps installed on our Windows 11 LTSC PC:"

From metros to non-metros, and from multiplexes to single screens, the film continues its dream run. That being said, the horror-comedy is set to cross the Rs 100 crore mark within three days of its release.

This marks the third successful horror-comedy release of 2024, joining the ranks of 'Munjya' and 'Stree 2', setting a promising trend for more films in this genre in the future.\n\nSpeaking of 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3', it is the third installment in the popular 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa' franchise. The first part Bhool Bhulaiyaa, released in 2007, starred Akshay Kumar and Vidya Balan in the lead roles.

A team quickly arrived at the scene, finding a burnt tin shed cabin with water tanks on the rooftop. A strong chemical smell filled the area, raising immediate suspicions. During their search of the building, two men of African-origin fled the scene.Police sources said initial inspections by the crime and forensic teams pointed to the presence of narcotics and hazardous chemicals. Local inquiries led police to suspect certain African nationals residing on the second floor, prompting a thorough search that uncovered a clandestine lab.\"Inside, they found methamphetamine , hydrochloric acid, hypophosphorous acid, and other dangerous, banned, and controlled substances,\" a source said. Alongside these drugs, various laboratory tools and equipment essential for manufacturing contraband substances were also seized.The seized items were documented as per section 105 OF Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), involving search and seizure recording through audio and video means. The Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) and crime teams secured all exhibits, and an FIR was registered under relevant sections of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.Preliminary findings revealed that the property was rented just two days before the lab's discovery. Police are investigating the landlord's role, and teams have been formed to apprehend the duo.On Jan 30, Dwarka Police had busted a methamphetamine syndicate, uncovering another lab."

With inconsistent play and a heavily scrutinized self-substitution, second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson is benched for now.\n\nHowever, my focus for the best bet right now is on the Vikings sideline. I like Sam Darnold to go over his 20.5 completions line (-120 at FanDuel).\n\nThis Colts defense has allowed over 20 completions to every starting quarterback they\u2019ve faced except for Will Levis. The other four, much more established starters, passed that total easily.\n\nCombine that with the fact that Joe Flacco\u2019s gunslinging ways could create a shootout, and the opportunities to throw should be there all night for Darnold."
