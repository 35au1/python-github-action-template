        "article_content": "Ominous images of a perfectly spherical UFO, seemingly dotted with yellow 'landing lights,' have left some researchers certain one is 'the first selfie with a UFO in history.'\n\nTaken by Brazilian UFO researcher and author Edie Meireles in 2011, the snaps show the apparent craft above a hiking trail to 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n,' a chilly waterfall in Brazil's high-altitude Chapada Diamantina National Park.\n\nWhat followed, at least, according to one of Meireles' UFO-hunting peers, was years of 'threats and intrigues' \u2014 with two members of their group 'killed by the military' and three more 'abducted.'\n\nAnd by Meireles' own account, his sighting in one of South America's most scenic ecological preserves led to a raid on his home by 'soldiers in camouflage and black.'\n\nPhotos, taken by Brazilian UFO researcher and author Edie Meireles in 2011 (pictured), show the an ominous apparent craft above a hiking trail to 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n' - a chilly waterfall in the South American nation's high-altitude Chapada Diamantina national park\n\nIn a recent, March 2022 post to the group UFOs Bahai on Facebook, Meireles boasted that his candid snap was 'the only selfie with a flying saucer.' Above, a second and less clear 'UFO selfie' from Meireles' alleged encounter with a flying orb in Chapada Diamantina national park\n\nWhat followed, at least, according to one of Meireles' UFO-hunting peers, was years of 'threats and intrigues' \u2014 with two members of their group 'killed by the military' and three more 'abducted.' Above, another photo from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nSkeptics on social media, however, have alleged that the photos are everything from 'sky lanterns' held aloft by hot air from candles to outright doctored images.\n\nDailyMail.com reached out to Meireles for further comment \u2014 but the researcher, who serves as admin for 'el Grupo de Pesquisa Tecnol\u00f3gica Extra Avan\u00e7ada' ('the Extra-Advanced Technology Research Group') on Facebook has not replied.\n\nBut, in a March 2022 post, Meireles boasted that his candid snaps were 'the only selfie with a flying saucer.'\n\nAnd, in a submission to Brazilian nonprofit Museu da Pessoa (Museum of the Person) the UFO researcher recounted his trips back to the national park for repeated, but less-well-documented, encounters with these UFOs and their occupants.\n\nThose expeditions, documented in his book Fieldworkers: Pesquisadores de Campo in 2016, according to Meireles, led to further unwanted encounters with the military.\n\n'The result of the interrogation was [...] Fractures: 4 left ribs and left knee [...] Perforation with bleeding in the left lung,' and worse, Meireles told the nonprofit.\n\n'I was hospitalized for 12 days at the Chapada Regional Hospital, in Seabra-Ba, my medical history is there for anyone who wants to investigate,' according to the Brazilian UFO researcher.\n\nMeireles' version of his UFO experiences at the national park, includes more surreal encounters with beings and a prophecy of global environmental cataclysm: 'a natural collapse, with a lack of renewable resources, drinking water, and wood for construction,' as he told the nonprofit museum.\n\nFact or fiction, his story has a fitting setting in Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park, established in September 1985 to protect a host of rare, endangered species native to these Atlantic Forest plateaus 3,000 feet about sea level.\n\nBrazil's giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), its giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) and Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus) are all protected species that call the park home.\n\nAbove, another photo from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nAbove, lateral blur on the apparent craft appears to indicate a form of propulsion in another photo alleged to be from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nAbove, another image of lateral blur on the apparent 'alien spacecraft' - which appears to indicate a form of propulsion in another image from Meireles' alleged 2011 UFO encounter\n\nOne account of the 2011 sighting, attributed to Meireles, described a UFO whose onboard devices or novel means of propulsion managed to either accidentally or intentionally leave him stranded in the park.\n\n'I got out of the car and photographed,' according to a Reddit posting quoting Meireles. 'It was an indescribable wonderful emotion to have photographed a UFO so clearly visible.'\n\nBut, the account continues: 'About 40 minutes later, still on the road, my car turned off, I braked, I tried to turn the key and nothing, absolutely nothing.\n\n'I saw a light on the hood and I looked up and there was a UFO standing on top of my car, I opened the door and ran,' the account continues.\n\n'I even stopped to take a Selfie with them. My car was towed by a tractor the next day, it burned all electrical parts.'\n\nThis version of his encounter states that Meireles was travelling to the historic district near the national park, Serra de Igat\u00fa, although a 2016 posting apparently by Meireles on Facebook asserts the images were taken on his was to the waterfall at the park known as 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n.'\n\nAbove, 'Mosquito Waterfall,' one of many waterfalls like the 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n' from Meireles' UFO encounter, visited by tourists of Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nAbove, a final known image from Meireles' alleged 2011 UFO encounter, this time with less fog or low-lying cloud cover along the trail in Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nAn aerial view of Chapada Diamantina National Park in Bahia state, Brazil\n\nAbove, tourists admire the 'Poco Encantado' (aka 'the Enchanted Well') a sunken, subterranean pool and tourist destination at Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nSome champions of Meireles' UFO research have attributed the murky stories around his incredibly crisp and visually compelling photographs to the alleged hostile encounters with the military.\n\nH\u00e9lio Nunes de Camargo, the self-decribed founder of UFOs na Chapada \u2013 Centro Ufol\u00f3gico da Chapada Diamantina, wrote that Meireles' UFOs Bahai research group disbanded over the alleged military harassments and violence.\n\n'They are leaving UFOlogy to live their own lives away from threats and intrigues,' Nunes de Camargo wrote in a 2014 post to his group's Facebook page.\n\nThe UFO researcher recounted the deaths and abductions that UFOs Bahai is alleged to have faced, adding: 'They told me that families are suffering a lot and they don't want to make other families suffer.'\n\nOther UFO researchers online, however, have had trouble with this explanation.\n\n'The fact that he's [Meireles] still uploading those photos to his Facebook account every few months proves that might not be correct,' Reddit user spriz2 opined.\n\n'I've written to Edie multiple times on Facebook over the last year to try and gain more knowledge on this event,' the Redditer explained. 'He's ignored every message and comment.'\n\nOthers, however, not only found the case credible but believed they had seen this same UFO themselves.\n\n'Holy F***, this is identical to what I saw right before Covid hit,' one Redditer, who goes by ehtseeoh, said.\n\nThe poster said that the bottom of the craft he saw 'rotated when it glowed red with an orange center, and then it did a quick zig zag and it was gone,' making 'zero sound' as it vanished in an instant.\n\n'I screamed laughed and cried,' the poster said. 'FINALLY the orb I've been looking for online, this guy has a selfie with it haha.'\n\nDailyMail.com also reached out to noted UFO skeptic and computer programmer Mick West of Sacramento, California, who weighed-in saying: 'They look photoshopped to me, but could be practical effects.'\n\nThe prolific, skeptically minded, UFO researcher and former video game designer noted that UFO cases like this, with limited information like static images and inconsistent eye-witness testimony, should always be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n'In cases like this we need actual evidence that the photos are NOT fake before attempting to explain them,' West told DailyMail.com via email."

        "article_content": "The opportunity arose for Swallow after a chance meeting with Gerry's son Jamie Anderson, now head of his late father's company Anderson Entertainment \u2013 with the two men sharing an agent, Swallow arranged a meeting with Jamie to express his enthusiasm for Gerry's works.\n\nThe conversation eventually turned to the idea of crafting new stories set within the timeline of the original shows, with Swallow keen to explore the worlds of UFO and Space: 1999, two series which had \"the strongest impact\" on him in the early 1970s.\n\n\"Jamie came back to me and said, 'We've got this idea about doing these novellas \u2013 would you like to take a crack at it?'\" Swallow recalls. \"I pretty much bit his hand off.\n\nMore like this\n\n\"It's been a lot of fun for me \u2013 It gave me a great excuse to go back and rewatch the shows and kind of steep myself in them again. I tried very hard to make sure that I wrote these new stories in the style of that early 1970s sci-fi.\n\n\"I wanted to make it feel like these two manuscripts had been lying in a box somewhere since 1972... so if you love these shows, you could watch the TV show and then pick up the book, and it would feel like a seamless experience.\"\n\nThe cast of Space: 1999. Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images\n\nFirst aired in 1970-71, UFO \u2013 the first wholly live-action show produced by the Andersons following the Supermarionation success of Thunderbirds, Stingray and others \u2013 followed the covert efforts of top-secret military agency SHADO to prevent an alien invasion of Earth.\n\nThough a second season never materialised, initial concepts for further episodes eventually formed for the basis for the next show on the slate: Space: 1999 (aired 1975-1977) saw the moon, and the 311 inhabitants of Moonbase Alpha, sent hurtling out of Earth's orbit towards the unknown dangers of the galaxy.\n\nSwallow's new efforts, he says, \"dovetail with the source material\", with the hope being that you \"feel like you're reading an episode of the TV show that never got made\".\n\n\"I tried to do a little more than maybe they could have done on the TV shows, so I've got a few elements in both books which would have blown the budget had it been the television episode,\" he adds. \"But I've got the best budget ever, which is my readers' imagination.\"\n\nSpace: 1999 - The Armageddon Engine sees Commander John Koenig (as played on television by Martin Landau) and the people of Moonbase Alpha face an uncertain fate when a planet-killing alien weapon at the heart of a sinister cloud diverts their lost moon on to a fatal trajectory, while UFO - Shadowplay see SHADO commander-in-chef Ed Straker (played by Ed Bishop in the series) awaken from a coma with missing memories and suffering from strange hallucinations that threaten his grip on reality.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn telling these stories, Swallow was allowed to \"play with somebody else's toys\", but knew he couldn't \"leave sticky fingerprints all over them\" \u2013 and that the continuity of the television shows imposed certain limitations.\n\n\"In terms keeping inside the canon, I think that's part and parcel of taking on one of these jobs,\" he explains.\n\n\"You're not going to break it. You're going to work inside the lines. And some people have said to me, you know, isn't that like a straightjacket for you? Isn\u2019t it an intellectually bereft way of writing? And I think the exact opposite is true.\n\n\"It's challenging to me working inside the box. My first thought is, how do I push at the edges of that box? How do I kind of work inside the lines but still deliver something that reveals something new about these characters while acting in respect to the core material?\"\n\nCould these two books be just the beginning of a range of new adventures? Swallow is certainly hopeful, and suggests there's a hunger among other authors to engage with the worlds of Gerry Anderson.\n\nUFO and Space: 1999 novellas. Anderson Entertainment\n\n\"I had an absolute blast doing this \u2013 sometimes working on these type of projects can be a real pain, if you're working with somebody who's watching every tiny little detail, but there was such great creative freedom here, and it was such a fun bunch of people to work with.\n\n\"I would love to do it again, and I've heard from friends of mine who are other writers who are saying, 'Oh, that's a great franchise, we\u2019d love to be part of that.' So I think there's a market for it, there's an audience for it, and there's definitely a love for these stories, so we could tell more.\"\n\nGiven that UFO and Space: 1999 are effectively sister series, albeit a shared continuity was never established between the shows on television, might a crossover story even be on the cards in future?\n\n\"I've always thought these two shows feel like they took place in the same world,\" says Swallow. \"If you look at the timeline of it, Ed Straker was running SHADO in 1980 and Moonbase Alpha\u2019s in 1999\u2026 maybe these guys knew each other?\n\n\"I think that would be fun, to explore the idea of finding some sort of way to connect them... because of course UFO\u2019s story was never brought to a conclusion. You had this ongoing sort of Cold War story with these alien invaders and the show finished after one season and we never found out... were they defeated? What happened? And then Space: 1999 rolls along, [set] a decade later...\n\n\"Well, did something happen between the point of those stories? That would be fun to explore, I think.\"\n\nGet sci-fi news direct to your inbox The best sci-fi news and features this side of the Outer Rim.

I think that would work, definitely. You could update that to the modern day and you wouldn't really need to change an awful lot.\"\n\nAs for Space: 1999, though he argues you'd need \"brush over the scientific elements that were maybe a bit wobbly in the show\" \u2013 chiefly a nuclear explosion blowing the moon out of Earth's orbit \u2013 he adds: \"The core concept about a group of people stranded in this satellite moving through space, who have no control where they're going, coming up against danger and meeting people, and finding a way to survive again... that's a compelling idea.\"\n\nSpace: 1999 - The Armageddon Engine and UFO - Shadow Play novellas are available to buy from gerryanderson.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out more of our Sci-Fi coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what's on.

While much of his work is classified, the memoir promises to reveal all that can be lawfully disclosed, providing a first-hand account of the shocking discoveries, challenges, and breakthroughs that have marked the U.S Government\u2019s investigation and understanding of UAP and non-human intelligence, as well as the profound effects on Stratton and his family.\n\n\u201cWe are at the beginning of a new chapter for humanity. The process of disclosure is complex but it has begun,\u201d said Jay Stratton.\n\nStratton served for 32 years in the Army, Air Force, Naval Intelligence, and the Defense Intelligence Agency, where he was Chief of Air & Space Warfare in the Defense Warning Office.\n\nHe was involved in the creation of the U.S. government\u2019s Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems Applications Program, the first official U.S Government program to investigate UFOs since Project Blue Book was shuttered in 1969.\n\nJay Stratton also created the U.S. government\u2019s UAP Task Force at the request of the Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense.\n\nOne of the members of that team was David Grusch \u2013 a veteran of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), who claimed in front of Congress that the United States had retrieved and studied UFOs of non-human origin."

        "article_content": "Former National Security Advisor and retired Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster became the latest official to make eyebrow-raising comments about UFOs, now formally rebranded as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d or UAP.\n\nAsked about UAP during a Sept. 6 appearance on \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher,\u201d McMaster stated that \u201cthere are phenomena that have been witnessed by multiple people that are just inexplicable by any kind of science available to us.\u201d\n\nMcMaster\u2019s intriguing comments come at a critical moment in a growing national discussion about UAP. The Senate is poised to take up the bipartisan Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act, arguably the most extraordinary legislation ever introduced in Congress.\n\nSponsored by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), the Disclosure Act alleges that a decades-long government \u201clegacy program\u201d has secretly retrieved and is attempting to reverse-engineer UAP of \u201cunknown\u201d and \u201cnon-human\u201d origin. Not only is \u201cnon-human intelligence\u201d formally defined, but the attention-grabbing term appears two dozen times throughout the 64-page legislation.\n\nAstoundingly, the Disclosure Act would also require the federal government to take possession of \u201cany and all\u201d recovered UAP and \u201cbiological evidence of non-human intelligence\u201d transferred to private defense contractors.\n\nWith multiple seemingly credible sources corroborating the existence of such secret programs, it is imperative that Congress pass the legislation without delay.\n\nThe introduction of the Disclosure Act, along with fascinating public comments like those from McMaster, marks a seismic shift in the official tone on the UFO phenomenon.\n\nFor over six decades, the U.S. government implemented a formal policy of \u201cdebunking,\u201d \u201cridiculing\u201d and dismissing even the most credible UAP incidents, frequently with demonstrably absurd and unscientific explanations.\n\nBut the December 2017 publication of a bombshell New York Times article fundamentally transformed the discourse on this long-stigmatized topic.\n\nAsked in 2020 about seemingly inexplicable, years-long U.S. Navy encounters with UAP, former CIA Director John Brennan made a jaw-dropping statement, suggesting that \u201ca different form of life\u201d might be behind the perplexing incidents.\n\nOver a decade after they were first formally reported, naval aviators\u2019 daily observations of UAP exhibiting amazing flight characteristics off the East Coast remain officially unexplained.\n\nJohn Ratcliffe, director of national intelligence under former President Trump, injected fascinating context into recent military encounters with the UFO phenomenon. In a 2021 interview, Ratcliffe stated that UAP \u201chave been picked up by satellite imagery [and] frankly engage in actions that are difficult to explain, movements that are hard to replicate, that we don\u2019t have the technology for.\u201d\n\nU.S. intelligence analysts, Ratcliffe continued, have \u201chigh confidence\u201d that foreign adversaries such as China or Russia were not behind one of the most extraordinary, best-documented UAP incidents.\n\nAlarmingly, Ratcliffe stated that UAP exhibit \u201ctechnologies that we don\u2019t have and, frankly, that we are not capable of defending against.\u201d\n\nIn late 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson suggested directly that recent military encounters with UAP could have extraterrestrial explanations.\n\nSimilarly, the prospect of a sitting high-level national security official openly discussing otherworldly origins for UAP was long unthinkable. But current Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines raised eyebrows in 2021 when she pointedly did not rule out \u201cextraterrestrial\u201d origins for UAP.\n\nFormer presidents Clinton, Obama and Trump generated headlines when asked about the phenomenon in recent years. Echoing McMaster, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Mark Milley said last August that some reported UAP incidents are \u201creally kind of weird and unexplainable.\u201d\n\nSuch notable comments from top-level officials align with publicly available data. Sophisticated mathematical analyses of the most recognizable UAP footage and best-documented incidents, for example, corroborate fighter pilot and radar operator accounts of craft exhibiting highly advanced technology. Moreover, several other perplexing UAP videos, in tandem with supporting context and data, stubbornly resist prosaic explanations.\n\nPerhaps most alarmingly, mysterious objects exhibiting seemingly astonishing technology conducted a series of brazen incursions around sensitive U.S. military assets \u2014 including nuclear missile silos \u2014 in recent years.\n\nIn light of these remarkable developments, Congress must get to the bottom of the decades-long UFO mystery and pass the UAP Disclosure Act.\n\nMarik von Rennenkampff served as an analyst with the Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, as well as an Obama administration appointee at the Department of Defense.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

At an early co-op placement, for instance, he helped develop an app called Joyi, which delivers bite-sized psychology lessons to help teens manage stress and anxiety.\n\nA new idea emerged, however, as he heard first-hand accounts about difficulties fellow students had accessing care on campus and began learning about the subclinical stage of mental health disorders in his classes. At the same time, he saw stunning leaps being made with large language model artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT.\n\nThose elements coalesced in Rassoli's latest creation: Doro, an app that aims to coach students in tackling their mental health concerns early on, before symptoms escalate.\n\n\"LLMs can make things very accessible. And in the mental health industry, we really have this problem of accessibility,'\" he said.\n\nAbout one in five Canadian youth who reported having \"good,\" \"very good\" or \"excellent\" mental health in 2019 downgraded that status to \"fair\" or \"poor\" by 2023, Statistics Canada said this week. People aged 15 to 24 are already more likely to experience mental illness and/or substance use disorders than any other age group.\n\nAs young people struggle to find care, a new wave of AI mental health and wellness apps have emerged of late, offering support at one's fingertips, 24/7. Yet experts warn that an app can't replace conventional treatment, especially in serious or emergency situations.\n\nWhat kind of apps are out there?\n\nThe general idea behind these apps is for users to type out messages sharing their concerns, as if \"chatting\" to a real-life therapist.\n\nThe technology can draw from a database of knowledge, reference what a person has shared or discussed across multiple past sessions and deliver responses in a convincingly conversational way. An app might encourage further reflection, for instance, or lead a user through guided meditation. Another could prompt you with some cognitive behavioural therapy techniques.\n\nWATCH | This app coaches students on tackling mental health concerns at an early stage: A quick walk-through Doro, a chatbot mental wellness app Duration 3:49 University student Rastin Rassoli gives CBC News a brief demo of Doro, his app using chatbot technology to coach students on tackling mental health concerns at an early stage.\n\nRassoli envisions Doro as an early intervention tool for youth starting to experience challenges: maybe someone struggling with disrupted sleep, or a person anxious over an upcoming school presentation. Perhaps this student got waitlisted when seeking help on campus, or didn't reach out in the first place, fearing stigma.\n\n\"We try to identify these specific things \u2014 the specific risk factors, behaviours and symptoms [shared by the user] \u2014 and focus on each of these,\" he said.\n\nThen, he says, Doro pulls from a variety of techniques to suggest how to manage those symptoms and offers small tasks for improvement, while also tracking each session. It might suggest journalling, for instance, or TIPP, a method for managing panic attacks.\n\nCan it replace a human therapist?\n\nIf a user's described symptoms cross a certain threshold into a crisis or emergency, however, Doro immediately refers them to a real person.\n\n\"For people with serious disorders, we immediately stop the chat. We ask them to please use the helpline or one of the available therapists in your region,\" he said.\n\nWATCH | A chatbot can feel easy to talk to, but it's not the same as therapy, says researcher: A chatbot can feel easier than talking to a therapist. But it's not the same thing, says researcher Duration 3:33 New mental health apps using AI chatbot technology promise more access to mental health support for young people, but Rachel Katz, who is researching ethical issues of using AI for psychotherapy, questions whether users truly get the help they need.\n\nFor those who've never seen a mental health professional before, an AI app might seem like an easy starting point, given that it's indeed tough to share mental health struggles, noted Rachel Katz, a PhD candidate researching ethical issues of using AI for psychotherapy.\n\n\"My concern though is that these [apps] don't actually effectively bridge that gap. It sort of reinforces the isolation of a mental health struggle,\" said Katz, who is based at the University of Toronto's Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology.\n\n\"It reinforces this hyper-independence and kind of further entrenches people in this inability to reach out and actually talk to a person.\"\n\nHow could these apps benefit young people?\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, close to one billion people worldwide \u2014 including 14 per cent of the world's adolescents \u2014 suffer from a mental disorder, with anxiety and depression among the most common. Most mental health professionals focus on adults; there aren't enough serving young people, according to Eduardo Bunge, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California, who first began exploring AI chatbots in the mental health space about six years ago.\n\nEven if students do connect to support, help isn't available at all hours every day, added Bunge, who believes clinicians working alongside AI apps could help increase young people's access to care.\n\nWATCH | 'Making this human feel better' is what matters: Whether an app is 'making this human feel better' is what matters, says researcher Duration 2:48 Different mental health concerns require different interventions, says Palo Alto University Professor Eduardo Bunge, but if people find talking to a chatbot helpful, why shouldn't professionals add that technology to their toolbox?\n\nMental health professionals can create and curate the knowledge bases feeding into these AI platforms and set limits for them, and should also conduct ongoing monitoring of the user interactions, he said, which could help ease many people's concerns.\n\nA chatbot \"is like a very good first line of treatment \u2014 that may not be sufficient [alone]\u2026 but it's better than doing nothing. And it could be a perfect segue, if we use it carefully, to lead them to have better outcomes.\"\n\nCan you trust a chatbot?\n\nThere's definite potential in the technology, says Dr. Michael Cheng from Ottawa children's hospital CHEO. A chatbot could be used to easily point a young person toward specific mental health resources or information, for instance.\n\nStill, he's concerned about issues of safety, privacy and confidentiality, use of patient data and an overall lack of regulation at the moment.\n\n\"It's a bit of a Wild West right now,\" said the child and adolescent psychiatrist. \"Anyone can just [release] an app and say it does whatever.\"\n\nDr. Michael Cheng, a child and family psychiatrist at Ottawa children's hospital CHEO, sees promise in using AI chatbot technology in the mental health care space, but he's concerned with a host of issues, including safety, how patient data is used and lack of regulation on apps. 'It's a bit of a Wild West right now.' (Marc Robichaud/CBC)\n\nCheng is also wary of young people turning to an app rather than building healthy human connections, which are necessary for mental wellness.\n\n\"We are seeing an epidemic of children, youth and families who are disconnected from people.\u2026 They're spending excessive time in front of screens.\n\n\"The challenge with generative AI is that it can be used to create experiences which are even more addictive.\"\n\nAt this point, chatbots shouldn't be used without supervision by human therapists, believes Katz, the medical ethicist. She pointed to high-profile instances of chatbots delivering problematic or harmful suggestions, like the case where a chatbot replacing an eating disorder hotline suggested dieting and weight loss to users.\n\nWhat do students think?\n\nJason Birdi, who studies biotechnology at Waterloo, has tried chatbots for generating ideas, but he draws the line at other uses, including anything health-related.\n\n\"I don't trust the system. I don't know where that information is going,\" he said.\n\nKaden Johnson, a University of Toronto Mississauga student, sees promise in them, since he knows some peers have a hard time opening up to another person and worry about being judged.\n\nYet new tools like this should be an option and not a replacement for traditional services or professionals, said the second-year political science student.\n\n\"Mental health specialists or [resources] where people can go to access those services shouldn't be cut back as we roll out AI. I think they should continue to increase.\""

        "article_content": "Days away from the resumption of contract negotiations that will help determine how animation firms can use generative artificial intelligence in the next few years, the Animation Guild has released a report detailing the threat that the technology poses to its members.\n\n\u201cCritical Crossroads: The Impact of Generative AI and the Importance of Protecting the Animation Workforce,\u201d produced by the union\u2019s member task force dedicated to AI, finds that generative AI applications and programs create outputs \u201cthat can target most of the job categories of TAG members, spanning from design to production, animation to scriptwriting.\u201d Currently, 3D models, full-color 3D sets, blue sky concepts and full-color renderings are all work that can be produced with the technology in its current state.\n\nAccording to a survey of company executives commissioned by the Animation Guild and the Concept Art Association earlier this year, 78 percent of companies doing animation work will be \u201cearly adopters\u201d of generative AI in the next three years. Fifty-one percent of firms anticipate using the technology to create 3D assets, while 41 percent expect to employ it to generate 2D artwork. About one-third anticipate using generative AI in their productivity organization and management strategies, while one-quarter foresee using it to generate film and TV scripts.\n\nThe report states that entry-level positions will be most at risk for disruption, by consolidation or elimination in the near future. \u201cAI systems are likely to disproportionately affect those\n\nfrom less affluent backgrounds and underrepresented communities who have traditionally used these roles as a means toward economic mobility,\u201d the document adds.\n\nThe report arrives at a strategic point for the union, as the Animation Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers remain deadlocked on the issue of AI in their ongoing contract negotiations. The parties are set to return to the bargaining table Monday.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s report, the Animation Guild affirmed that tackling generative AI is its top priority in those talks. Per the union, an AI survey of its members conducted in March found that 100 percent of respondents supported adding provisions to the union contract barring the use of generative AI from displacing members\u2019 work. Eighty-seven percent sought to prohibit employers from using unionized work to train generative AI systems, while 75 percent wanted to institute staffing minimums and employment duration minimums to offset any job disruption caused by generative AI.\n\nBeyond fighting for strong contract provisions in this year\u2019s negotiations, the union\u2019s AI task force recommended responding to the advancement of generative AI by engaging legislators on the issue, advocating for animation tax incentives that favor human-created work, tracking possible regulation, launching awareness campaigns and considering how the courts will help shape the future of the technology.\n\n\u201cOur research highlights the potential risk that GenAI systems pose to animation workers, underscoring the need to be involved in discussions and decisions about GenAI to protect our rights and the integrity of our work,\u201d the task force stated in the conclusion to its document. Through the union\u2019s efforts at the bargaining table and beyond, the task force stated, \u201cTAG aims to ensure that the industry adapts to AI advancements without sacrificing the rights and jobs of its workers.\u201d"

        "article_content": "On Thursday, Google made Gemini Live, its voice-based AI chatbot feature, available for free to all Android users. The feature allows users to interact with Gemini through voice commands on their Android devices. That's notable because competitor OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode feature of ChatGPT, which is similar to Gemini Live, has not yet fully shipped.\n\nGoogle unveiled Gemini Live during its Pixel 9 launch event last month. Initially, the feature was exclusive to Gemini Advanced subscribers, but now it's accessible to anyone using the Gemini app or its overlay on Android.\n\nGemini Live enables users to ask questions aloud and even interrupt the AI's responses mid-sentence. Users can choose from several voice options for Gemini's responses, adding a level of customization to the interaction.\n\nGemini suggests the following uses of the voice mode in its official help documents:\n\nTalk back and forth: Talk to Gemini without typing, and Gemini will respond back verbally.\n\nBrainstorm ideas out loud: Ask for a gift idea, to plan an event, or to make a business plan.\n\nExplore: Uncover more details about topics that interest you.\n\nPractice aloud: Rehearse for important moments in a more natural and conversational way.\n\nInterestingly, while OpenAI originally demoed its Advanced Voice Mode in May with the launch of GPT-4o, it has only shipped the feature to a limited number of users starting in late July. Some AI experts speculate that a wider rollout has been hampered by a lack of available computer power since the voice feature is presumably very compute-intensive.\n\nTo access Gemini Live, users can reportedly tap a new waveform icon in the bottom-right corner of the app or overlay. This action activates the microphone, allowing users to pose questions verbally. The interface includes options to \"hold\" Gemini's answer or \"end\" the conversation, giving users control over the flow of the interaction.\n\nCurrently, Gemini Live supports only English, but Google has announced plans to expand language support in the future. The company also intends to bring the feature to iOS devices, though no specific timeline has been provided for this expansion."

        "article_content": "TV ghost hunter Barri Ghai was filmed being 'strangled' by an evil spirit in the Worcestershire attic of pop icon Toyah Willcox in Pershore on TV show Celebrity Help! My House is Haunted on Discovery\n\nTV ghost hunter Barri Ghai had a terrifying encounter with an 'evil spirit' in the attic of pop legend Toyah Willcox's Worcestershire home. The paranormal expert was left 'gasping for air' after being 'strangled' by a ghoul during filming for the new series of Celebrity Help! My House is Haunted. Ghai, along with his colleagues Ian Shaw and Jayne Harris, had set up a special 'REM' recording device at the historic Pershore residence of the 1980s singer for the popular TV show on Discovery+. Viewers will witness Ghai seemingly restrained while conducting an investigation in the attic. The team attempted to communicate with a ghost named 'George', believed to be a soldier from the English civil war in the 1600s. Willcox, who has experienced \"persistent paranormal activity\" since moving to the picturesque Worcestershire town two decades ago, signed up for the show. The punk pop icon, famous for hits like It's a Mystery, I Want To Be Free and Echo Beach, resides in a historic Georgian house with her guitarist husband Robert Fripp. During the ghost hunting visit, Ghai can be seen clutching his throat before hastily exiting the attic, reports Birmingham Live.\n\nTV ghost hunter Barri Ghai was filmed being 'strangled' by an evil spirit\n\nGhai recounted: \"Something just grabbed my windpipe. F**king scared the s**t out of me. I couldn't get breath in, that's what scared me.\" \"I thought I was gonna die. I actually thought I was going to die.\" This is what Barri Ghai, one of the nation's leading paranormal investigators, confessed after a chilling encounter during a haunted house visit. His colleague Harris urgently intervened, pleading with the unseen presence, \"Whoever's doing that, can you step away please? You do not have permission to do that. Step away from Barri.\"\n\nA paranormal team with Toyah in Pershore\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nReflecting on the harrowing experience later in the show, Ghai shared his intense moment with host Willcox, saying, \"Straight away we got some kind of indication that there was a bit more of an aggressive male energy that was very dominant up there,\" and disclosed how he felt attacked by the spirit, \"And then, I was sat there, I was talking, and all of a sudden my windpipe was constricted. I couldn't breathe, I was actually really scared.\" The thrilling TV programme spotlights the expertise of three of Britains top ghost hunters: Ian Lawman, known for his skills as an exorcist and medium; Barri Ghai, who provides profound insights as a paranormal consultant; and Jayne Harris, a researcher and historian deeply immersed in paranormal lore. For those eager to be in the know about Worcestershire's latest talking points, signing up for our daily newsletter will ensure you're always in the loop.\n\nTrending\n\nVenturing into shadowy corners where spirits linger, this iconic trio uses their otherworldly talents to rid celebrities' homes of unwelcome spectres. Commentators were on edge when discussing the fifth episode shot in Pershore, with a spokesperson alluding to the gripping nature of Toyah's case on her website: \"To lend a helping hand, the team undergo one of their most terrifying investigations to date.\" What they unearth is staggering, connecting dots between an ancient medieval tragedy and the malicious ghost plaguing the property. Toyah, the seminal punk-pop starlet of the '80s, became enamoured with Pershore over twenty years ago, having been familiarised with it through holidays spent there with her family, a stark contrast to her urban Birmingham roots. Toyah Wilcox, the renowned singer, has lavished praise on Pershore, hailing it \"very friendly\" and \"one of the best places she's ever lived in the world\". Having spent her childhood weekends in the adjacent Wyre Piddle with her family, she became well-acquainted with the charm of the area.\n\nToyah Wilcox with her husband Robert Fripp"

Getty Images/Science Photo Library\n\n3 He\u2019s attempting to silence those who question him pointing to several other prophecies he alleges to have accurately predicted. Facebook / Athos Salom\u00e9\n\n\u201cOn 28 July this year, I posted a video in my Instagram stories again about the asteroid, predicting that NASA would make an announcement in September, confirming that the asteroid would enter a collision course with Earth by November,\u201d he told the Daily Star.\n\n\u201cMy predictions are not coincidences. They are grounded and come true.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Star reports that NASA is monitoring the \u201cGod of Chaos\u201d asteroid \u201cwhich is expected to brush past Earth at a mere 620,000 miles away on Sunday.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Salom\u00e9 also recently claimed to have alerted his followers to the Microsoft outage and warned it may lead to an \u201cescalation of confrontation\u201d and cyber war.\n\n\u201cBusinesses will have to improve the protection of cyberspace, and society might gain concerns over the use of internet services, led to discourses regarding intensive regulation. This event may result in shifts in political actions and military tactics on an international level, and the threat of an international war is real,\u201d he previously told the Daily Mail.\n\nSalom\u00e9 also says he predicted the planned cyberattacks targeting the 2024 Paris Olympics and corporate espionage in certain sectors.\n\n\u201cEvents of such magnitude like Olympics would be the ideal attack targets, capable of causing disturbances in the existing order,\u201d he told the Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cIt correctly demonstrates my hypothesis when the French authorities acted quickly and increased its cybersecurity measures,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThis is further indication that there is need for adequate and efficient measures of cyberspace protection during significant global occasions.\u201d\n\nAs he continues to warn of the increasingly important and nefarious role of technology, he\u2019s also warned that a significant cyberattack has the capability to \u201c\u2018cripple nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are approaching an era where technology plays a role, in conflicts,\u201d he previously said.\n\n\u201cForecasts are not set in stone but potential outcomes that can be changed. Our focus should be on resolutions and preventing conflicts,\u201d Salom\u00e9 said.\n\n3 He recently claimed to have alerted his followers to the Microsoft outage and warned it may lead to an \u201cescalation of confrontation\u201d and cyber war. AP\n\nMeanwhile, the fortune teller also warned of severe weather impacting parts of Asia.\n\n\u201cIn September of 2024 real events supported these expectations with typhoon Yagi,\u201d Salom\u00e9 said of the weather event that killed dozens of people in Vietnam earlier this week."

        "article_content": "Here is Entertainment Weekly\u2019s ranking of the 25 best found footage movies of all time.\n\nWhile many found footage movies remain in the horror sandbox \u2014 and, admittedly, some less talented filmmakers use the genre to do nothing at all \u2014 the format\u2019s best installments take the camera\u2019s limitations and spin them into a brilliant device to immerse the audience in various worlds. In some cases, they\u2019re worlds we\u2019d never want to visit.\n\nWith the notorious video nasty Cannibal Holocaust (1980), the found footage style dipped its toes into horror and never looked back. Though some movies played with the subgenre\u2019s trappings during the following decades \u2014 most notably the BBC special Ghostwatch (1992) \u2014 found footage didn\u2019t properly take hold until the advent of consumer-grade camcorders. The Blair Witch Project (1999) gave rise to a series of imitators, but it was Paranormal Activity (2007) that birthed the genre\u2019s most fertile period.\n\nMany argue that the first found footage picture was Shirley Clarke\u2019s The Connection (1961), a faux-documentary about a group of drug addicts \u2014 mostly musicians \u2014 waiting around an apartment for their dealer, while the cameraman tries to intervene and even manipulate the proceedings. A few years later, Milton Moses Ginsberg directed Coming Apart (1969) \u2014 a precursor to Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989) \u2014 that plays out in a seemingly unbroken shot and stars Rip Torn as a creepy psychiatrist who likes to film his amorous encounters with women.\n\nOne of the most affecting and moldable cinematic templates, found footage movies soared in popularity following The Blair Witch Project \u2019s debut 25 years ago \u2014 but the subgenre had already been percolating for nearly 40 years before that.\n\n25. Searching (2018) ELIZABETH KITCHENS/Sony Pictures This particularly sharp and savvy tech-thriller sees a father (John Cho) investigating the disappearance of his daughter (Michelle La), who led a busy and mysterious life on social media. Meanwhile, a dogged detective (Debra Messing, going against type with a hefty dramatic performance) assists in his efforts. Using a seamless combination of FaceTime calls, CCTV and news footage, and investigators\u2019 video evidence, Aneesh Chaganty weaves a riveting, anxious, and classically creepy found footage movie that puzzles until its final moments. Where to watch Searching: Starz\n\n24. Unfriended: Dark Web (2018) Blumhouse Productions An improvement over Unfriended (2014), this sequel finds five pals video chatting for their weekly game night. The twist: one of them logs in via the stolen laptop of a nefarious dark web user, who hacks their call and begins wreaking bloody havoc to regain his device. Tapping into terror and mean-spiritedness similar to Megan Is Missing, Dark Web holds you in its sweaty grip from start to finish with some clever editing and a nice spattering of jump scares. This isn\u2019t high art, but it\u2019s still a notably inventive computer-based thriller. Where to watch Unfriended: Dark Web: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n23. End of Watch (2012) Scott Garfield/Open Road David Ayer\u2019s white-knuckle police procedural follows two Los Angeles beat cops (Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe\u00f1a) who get embroiled with a gang of drug dealers. Admittedly, the found footage concept is shaky here. It\u2019s ostensibly sourced from dash and body cams, but Gyllenhaal\u2019s character is also making a documentary about his life, and by the third act it\u2019s unclear where the footage is coming from\u2026 if not the production-grade camera of a cinematographer (in this case, Roman Vasyanov). Yet Ayer\u2019s film is an undeniably powerful one. It works effortlessly as both a gritty urban thriller and a stirring testament to friendship and brotherhood. Where to watch End of Watch: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n22. The Bay (2012) Everett Barry Levinson, known for character dramas like Rain Man (1988) and comedies like Wag the Dog (1997), helmed this startling and unfortunately credible bio-horror tale. It concerns a Maryland community beset by waterborne parasites that take control of victims\u2019 bodies and brains, causing them to do terrible things. Levinson\u2019s movie is one of the most convincingly documentary-like in the found footage subgenre. The simple premise and pacing conceal its supreme power and startling chill, throwing you directly into the fray for a nightmarish immersive experience. Where to watch The Bay: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n21. The Last Broadcast (1998) Everett A documentarian (David Beard) enters the Pine Barrens to investigate the case of the Jersey Devil with drastic consequences in this gripping, lo-fi genre film that exists on a similar plain as The Blair Witch Project (not in cultural magnitude, but definitely in style). Their similar storylines are likely just a coincidence. But much like the infamous 1999 chiller (which was shot in 1997, around the same time as The Last Broadcast), this found footage movie benefits from empathetic lead performances by talented unknowns and plenty of regional charm. Where to watch The Last Broadcast: Tubi\n\n20. Willow Creek (2013) Dark Sky Films Comedian turned filmmaker Bobcat Goldthwait directed this amiable, genre-literate found footage movie, which stars Alexie Gilmore and Bryce Johnson as skeptical documentarians who explore the eponymous California town's obsession with Bigfoot. It\u2019s not a spoiler to say there\u2019s more truth to the legend than either anticipated. Willow Creek functions as both a jovial document of the town itself and, in its later stages, a properly suspenseful horror film. Goldthwait calls back to multiple classic forest-terror flicks, especially those from the genre\u2019s most fertile period in the \u201980s. The brilliant final punchline, without giving much away, nicely one-ups the similar conclusion of The Prey (1983). Where to watch Willow Creek: Peacock\n\n19. Megan Is Missing (2011) Trio Pictures Michael Goi\u2019s found footage shocker is remarkably upsetting and genuinely nauseating; it\u2019s an uncomfortable, grimy little thriller about two teens \u2014 Amy (Amber Perkins) and Megan (Rachel Quinn) \u2014 who meet an enigmatic young man called \u201cJosh\u201d online. After Megan disappears while going to meet him, Amy resolves to find out what happened to her friend. Both a savage warning to people of all ages not to mess around on the internet and a chilling horror pic in its own right, Megan Is Missing manages to be enthralling even as it flirts with being unwatchable, building breathtaking suspense before the uncompromising third act. Where to watch Megan Is Missing: Tubi\n\n18. VHS 2 (2013) Magnolia Pictures This second installment represents the venerable anthology franchise\u2019s height of humor, invention, and variety. Its frame story involves a crime-busting couple who, while searching for a missing coed, must view a variety of videotapes. The vignettes range from aliens crashing a slumber party to a man suffering a rogue ocular transplant, but the finest segments come courtesy of original Blair Witch Project director Eduardo S\u00e1nchez and The Raid (2011) filmmaker Gareth Evans. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s entry features industrious zombies hot on the tails of some cyclists, while Evans\u2019 installment (the best here) deals with a demented doomsday cult. Where to watch VHS 2: Hulu\n\n17. The Poughkeepsie Tapes (2007) Scream Factory This skin-crawling faux-documentary concerns a prolific New York serial killer who evades capture despite recording his brazen crimes. As investigators review the snuff tapes, the fiend\u2019s identity comes into focus; but do they have the right man? Directed by brothers Drew and Eric Dowdle, who capably remade Rec as Quarantine (2008), The Poughkeepsie Tapes makes up for its occasional lapses in realism with its utterly distrubing portrayal of pure evil. It\u2019s a tough watch, and rarely an enjoyable one, but it's nevertheless effective as both a taut found footage film and a haunting home invasion thriller (not to mention that it touts one of the best horror movie masks of all time). Where to watch The Poughkeepsie Tapes: Tubi\n\n16. Grave Encounters (2011) Tribeca Film/Courtesy Everett This modern horror classic sees ghost hunters head to an abandoned psychiatric hospital to capture evidence of a genuine haunting, but they find much more than they bargained for. That ropy old setup gives way to one of the more effective, and certainly action-packed, entries in the found footage subgenre. Directors Colin Minihan and Stuart Ortiz wisely employ a slow build with sharp writing and character development up top. When everything goes ballistic, the film adopts a pace similar to the rollercoaster Italian ghost films of the 1980s. In other words, it\u2019s an absolute blast. Where to watch Grave Encounters: Tubi\n\n15. Cannibal Holocaust (1980) Everett One of the original found footage movies, Ruggero Deodato\u2019s landmark exploitation movie follows a New York City documentary crew into the Amazonian jungle to film indigenous cannibal tribes, where things of course go terribly wrong. Suffice it to say, the United Nations won\u2019t be screening Deodato\u2019s movie anytime soon. Most infamous for its inexcusable animal snuff sequences, the film is equally concerned with watching yuppies suffer at the hands of \u201cunhinged natives.\u201d Yet while lacking in decency and, frankly, class, Cannibal Holocaust features extremely effective queasy quasi-realism. It\u2019s also an undeniably significant cinematic relic that set many ground rules for found footage. Where to watch Cannibal Holocaust: Peacock\n\n14. Host (2020) Shudder This recent genre entry finds six friends holding a Zoom s\u00e9ance with a mysterious medium (Seylan Baxter), accidentally summoning a demonic entity into their homes in the process. Rob Savage\u2019s DIY creep-fest was produced and released during the initial COVID-19 lockdown, and it\u2019s one of the few cyber-based projects that works. The constraint provided by its premise gives the film a vigor and life lacking in most horror films set online (and even many found footage thrillers). Its scares are well-executed with generous character development and likable performances from the entire cast. Where to watch Host: AMC+\n\n13. The Taking of Deborah Logan (2014) Millennium Entertainment This harrowing faux-doc feels like a combination of Grey Gardens, Paranormal Activity, and the Anthony Hopkins drama The Father. It concerns a documentarian (Michelle Ang) chronicling the eponymous Deborah Logan (Jill Larson) and her daughter (Anne Ramsay) as Deborah succumbs to Alzheimer\u2019s. Yet as strange events occur around their home, the Logans wonder if something else is to blame for Deborah\u2019s condition. The Taking of Deborah Logan is a high-water mark for found footage. The performances are far beyond what the subgenre is typically graced with, while the suppressive atmosphere lends the film a claustrophobic feel despite multiple scenes set outside the house of horrors. It\u2019s a tricky, intelligent balancing act that director Adam Robitel pulls off with aplomb. Where to watch The Taking of Deborah Logan: Tubi\n\n12. Cloverfield (2008) Paramount/courtesy Everett Matt Reeves\u2019 directorial career broke through with this taut alien invasion horror riff, which plays intelligently (rather than exploitatively) with a queasy post-9/11 anxiety that was still common at the time of Cloverfield\u2019s release. Just as a group of carefree New York City twentysomethings (including Mike Vogel and Lizzy Caplan) gather to celebrate one of their friend\u2019s impending move westward, a creature the size of the Empire State Building descends on the city. From there, they have to navigate an increasingly chaotic Manhattan and a growing military presence in their desperate fight to evade the beast and its smaller compatriots. Where to watch Cloverfield: Paramount+\n\n11. Chronicle (2012) Alan Markfield/20th Century Studios Josh Trank\u2019s riveting inversion of the superhero mythos birthed the careers of Dane DeHaan and Michael B. Jordan. DeHaan stars as an awkward teen who films his every move and, along with his friends, stumbles upon a mysterious object that imbues them with remarkable powers. But the abilities bring out the darker sides of some, imperiling the world as the kids know it. Chronicle is one of the best superhero movies of the modern era, subverting many of the genre\u2019s tropes and character types while indulging the right amount of camp and spectacle (and all under 90 minutes). Where to watch Chronicle: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n10. Ghostwatch (1992) Shudder This groundbreaking BBC gem stars actual network anchors of the time in a fake \"live\" broadcast concerning a haunted house investigation on Halloween night. When a presence known as \u201cPipes\u201d makes itself ominously known and attempts to infiltrate the production, the on-air hosts must fight to stay alive \u2014 or, more accurately, to stay un-possessed. Highly controversial at the time, Ghostwatch spurred thousands of complaints to the network, many of which were from viewers who had believed the program was real. Indeed, Ghostwatch is one of the most clever examples of the format, one that\u2019s extra effective if you have context for the personalities of early-\u201990s BBC anchors. Where to watch Ghostwatch: AMC+\n\n9. The Visit (2015) Universal Pictures M. Night Shyamalan got his career back on track with this tense, genuinely funny potboiler. Two kids (Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould) finally get to visit their grandparents (Deana Dunagan, Peter McRobbie) for the first time since their mother (Kathryn Hahn) cut off contact. Things seem normal at first but quickly devolve once nighttime rolls around. Here, Shyamalan delivers his best work in over a decade, getting out of his own way and letting the story do the talking. It\u2019s as straightforward a thriller as you can get, one propulsively paced and executed with an abundance of mordant humor. Where to watch The Visit: Max\n\n8. Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum (2018) Well Go USA /Courtesy Everett Collection This exceptional K-horror film sees prankish web series hosts venture into a haunted asylum, where they\u2019ve set up a succession of cheap scares to thrill their viewers. Little do they know, the paranormal residents there have a few genuine frights in store for them. Gonjiam gets terrific mileage from a well-trod premise. You\u2019ll likely laugh out loud at how many times the movie gets you with the same is-it-or-isn\u2019t-it-real trick, but it\u2019s so well structured that you\u2019ll hardly mind playing the fool. There\u2019s also a pleasing lack of artifice here, both in the acting and Jung Bum-shik\u2019s direction, that makes this one of the most watchable found footage installments in recent memory. Where to watch Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum: Tubi\n\n7. Trollhunter (2010) Magnet Releasing/Courtesy Everett Collection Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal directed this transcendent comedic thriller about a group of student filmmakers who set out into the Norwegian countryside to make a documentary about poachers. But they\u2019re tempted to change their angle when they meet an enigmatic man (Otto Jespersen) who claims to spend his days hunting trolls. \u00d8vredal has gone on to a fairly robust Hollywood career, directing solid genre films like The Autopsy of Jane Doe (2016) and Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (2019). Yet Trollhunter remains his most fleshed-out and daring work, a cunning, scrappy little experiment that features impactful performances and action sequences. Where to watch Trollhunter: Max\n\n6. Hell House LLC (2015) Fbi Films There\u2019s nothing new or fancy in Hell House LLC, which makes its feverish grip on the audience even more admirable. Good-time youths venture to an abandoned inn, where 15 people perished in a commercial haunted house gone terribly wrong, to investigate the unexplained tragedy. Hell House takes its time spinning the tale of misfortune that befalls the central investigators. It deftly combines a pseudo-crime documentary angle with a down-and-dirty fright-fest that milks each corner of the cavernous inn for everything it\u2019s worth. Perhaps most astonishingly, the movie manages to make creepy clowns \u2014 that shopworn trope \u2014 genuinely frightening again. Where to watch Hell House LLC: AMC+\n\n5. Paranormal Activity (2007) Arguably the movie that kicked off found footage\u2019s most fruitful period, Oren Peli\u2019s masterfully orchestrated spook-fest concerns a young couple \u2014 Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) \u2014 who begin documenting eerie occurrences in their suburban home. The hair-raising moments in this homegrown genre hallmark arise nominally through character development, a key to Paranormal Activity\u2019s enduring power. Its simple formula sets the viewer up for at least one (usually more) scare every 10 minutes or so, slowly revealing the particulars of the plot without sacrificing the story\u2019s anxious mystery. Where to watch Paranormal Activity: Max\n\n4. Lake Mungo (2008) Lionsgate This somber Australian chiller, done in an exceptionally authentic faux-doc style, follows a family trying to piece together unexplainable supernatural events in the aftermath of their daughter\u2019s tragic, seemingly accidental death. It would be a stretch to call Lake Mungo a full-on horror movie, though it has several sequences of ceaseless tension and one incredible, thematically rich fright near the end. It\u2019s perhaps one of the only found footage movies that is nominally a kitchen-sink family drama, infused with inflections of the paranormal and a few bone-chilling moments along the way. The actors, meanwhile, do a tremendous job behaving like normal people caught on camera while making tiny, hugely influential performance choices. Where to watch Lake Mungo: Tubi\n\n3. Rec (2007) Everett A late-night TV host Angela (Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman plan to shoot a slice-of-life piece while following local firefighters to a city skyscraper. But when a mysterious virus imbues an elderly woman with excessive strength and a taste for blood, the police seal off the building, leaving the journalists and co. to face growing factions of the infected. This properly frightening genre exercise is one of the few found footage movies that properly utilizes the camera lens\u2019 limitations. Rec wrings an almost silly level of suspense and fear from what could be lurking on either side of the frame, a smart device that places the audience right in the center of the horror. Where to watch Rec: Tubi\n\n2. Creep (2014) Blumhouse Productions Mark Duplass gives his best performance to date in this psycho-thriller as a man who claims to be terminally ill and hires a filmmaker (Patrick Brice) to record him as a relic for his unborn son. It quickly becomes clear, however, that he can\u2019t be trusted as the cameraman unravels a dangerous web of secrets. Duplass and Brice (who also directed) wrote the screenplay together, marvelously blending suspense and comedy elements for a wholly original slow-burn horror film. Creep is able to maintain its mystery, and its dread, for much longer than most movies can muster, all while providing some modern jolts for viewers weaned on found footage. Where to watch Creep: Netflix"

        "article_content": "The success rate of IT projects can be improved by empowering business unit leaders to become tech innovators, Gartner Vice President Analyst Daniel Sanchez-Reina told a crowd of CIOs and IT leaders on Sept. 10 at the Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo in Australia.\n\nAs he explained, CIOs in Australia have historically struggled to meet objectives: Only 48% of digital projects are currently meeting or exceeding their goals. However, a cohort of top-performing CIOs are achieving at a much higher success rate, with 71% of their projects reaching their targets.\n\n\u201cThis distance is huge,\u201d Sanchez-Reina said. \u201cAnd we are talking about enterprise-wide digital initiatives.\u201d\n\nSEE: Adopt AI at your own pace, Gartner tells Australian IT leaders\n\nHe told delegates in Australia that it is possible for any CIO to contribute to this \u201cdigital vanguard\u201d and boost digital initiative success rates by co-owning future digital initiatives with heads of businesses.\n\nCo-owning digital projects with business leaders\n\nGartner compared findings from the largest global study of 3,100 CIOs with survey results from chief experience officers, which Sanchez-Reina defined as business, corporate function, or agency leaders.\n\nThe results showed IT leaders overcame \u201cthe curse of random success\u201d by \u201cco-owning\u201d digital projects.\n\n\u201cCo-owning means equal fair share of responsibility, equal fair share of accountability, equal fair share of participation,\u201d Sanchez-Reina explained.\n\nIn these successful \u201cdigital vanguard\u201d organisations, these CXO or business leaders:\n\nCo-own digital delivery with CIOs from start to finish.\n\nAllocate 70% more business area staff to technology work for at least part of their time.\n\nSanchez-Reina said this was not a case of \u201cshadow IT.\u201d Instead, business leaders were being mentored in digital initiatives by CIOs and relied on central CIO involvement to achieve their own success.\n\n\u201cThere is no CXO success in digital without CIO success \u2014 and the other way around,\u201d he said.\n\n4 steps to reduce the risk of digital project failure\n\nCIOs should consider four effective strategies to increase IT project success rates, according to Sanchez-Reina:\n\n1. Provide easy-to-use platforms for business units\n\nThe best CIOs are investing in technologies such as cybersecurity, AI, cloud, and hyper-automation for business areas as well as for IT. These technologies enable potential or current tech producers to more easily access and use digital platforms while also leveraging distributed digital talent, such as younger workers, in business areas.\n\nSEE: The top 10 strategic technology trends for 2025\n\n\u201cDo you know Gen Z are able to create a landing page using any software you train them in in the blink of an eye?\u201d Sanchez-Reina asked. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just Gen Z. Think of people who master exploiting business intelligence to the utmost \u2014 they are perfect candidates to develop more complex analytical capabilities.\u201d\n\n2. Boost the architectural awareness of business leaders\n\nCIOs at the digital vanguard are active in teaching business areas beyond IT about what Sanchez-Reina called the \u201cpillars of digital delivery.\u201d This includes aspects of what would usually be considered an IT role, including managing technology vendors, understanding technology costs, and cybersecurity impacts.\n\nIn contrast with what CIOs might believe, he emphasized that it is not \u201ctoo techy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more you grow digital vanguard CXOs, the more they will want you to give them advice on architectural things like, for example, vendor management,\u201d Sanchez-Reina explained. \u201cThey want it 1.6 times more than the rest of CXOs.\u201d\n\n3. Foster innovation leaders across business areas\n\nSanchez-Reina urged CIOs to make it easier for business areas to spot, incubate, and scale innovation in 2025. He said the top technologies CIOs have deployed or are about to deploy \u2014 such as generative AI low-code/no-code platforms \u2014 provide a foundation for such innovation efforts in business areas.\n\nAccording to Gartner data, only 18% of CIOs say they are doing this at the global level. However, Sanchez-Reina noted that as more digital business leaders are developed, they will increasingly seek CIOs\u2019 help in identifying innovation opportunities, supporting AI use cases, and becoming innovation leaders themselves.\n\n4. Support business leaders in digital skills planning\n\nMore CIOs at the digital vanguard extend digital skills development planning beyond the boundaries of IT. Gartner\u2019s data shows that currently two-thirds of this leading cohort of CIOs are helping business areas to forecast digital skills needs, compared with just 16% of the rest of global CIOs.\n\nCIOs are helping business units with skills planning and development in technologies that are relevant for their areas, digital leadership, building communities of practice, or AI.\n\n\u201cThe more you grow digital vanguard CXOs, the more they will want you to help their staff to develop technical skills,\u201d Sanchez-Reina said.\n\nCIOs deliver more digital initiatives, enjoy their jobs more\n\nThere is some good news for CIOs who make the effort to work with business leaders in 2025.\n\nCIOs concerned about the strategic enterprise initiatives in their backlog could end up accelerating time to market and value, according to Sanchez-Reina, which is a key concern for their CEOs.\n\nCIOs in this leading cohort are also more optimistic about their role and enjoy it more. They are less likely to look for other jobs, he noted, and are more likely to recommend a CIO career as an option for friends or family."

        "article_content": "For the past several years, Tier-1 supply titans have held tech-week shows to demonstrate their latest concepts to their OEM clients. In recent years Magna and Bosch have invited the press to join, and this year Valeo extended an invitation as well. Lots of the tech is way off in the weeds, but we\u2019ve distilled it down to the stuff promising to make motoring better for you in the near term.\n\nAugmented Reality In-Car Gaming: Valeo Racer\n\nFar and away the event\u2019s most fun technology leverages (at last) the immense onboard computing power of today\u2019s advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) to amuse passengers. Valeo Racer is an infinite-runner-style augmented reality game intended to be played on phones or tablets that are connected to the vehicle via WiFi and to game controllers via BlueTooth.\n\nThe game feeds live forward camera images of the world outside, while the players pilot little go-karts that are much smaller than the lane. The object is to \u201ccollect\u201d as many gold coins as possible as they come bouncing down the lane toward you, while avoiding other vehicles (which the ADAS computer has already identified as target objects), as well as rows of cones, tires, and other hazards the game throws in. Hitting any of the above reduces your score. Two controller buttons are active: one allows the kart to jump (over obstacles, or to catch high-flying coins), and the other \u201cboosts\u201d speed and scoring. Boost supply is limited and recharged by collecting lightning bolts scattered amongst the coins\u2014all of which are worth more when in Boost mode. Using a headrest-mounted tablet keeps the horizon in view, so Valeo claims extremely low reported incidents of the motion sickness that often afflicts headset wearers in moving vehicles.\n\nIt\u2019s no fun when the car is stopped, so the \u201chost\u201d (driver) can load a version crossing the Golden Gate Bridge when stopped in traffic, or can open a \u201cshop\u201d where coin balances can be used to upgrade cars, helmets, etc. There are no hardware costs for any car with sufficient camera and onboard ADAS computing power, and an unnamed OEM is under contract to incorporate Valeo Racer next year.\n\nTrailering Tech: Bosch Anywhere Parking\n\nBosch Anywhere Parking is a drag-and-drop, screen-based solution that does away with knob twiddling to help towing novices park their camper in a site or their boat in the water like a pro. The system leverages 360-degree camera systems. First it determines the size of the trailer, distance from hitch to axles, etc. Then as you drive by a camp site, boat launch or whatever and activate the system, it makes an image of the trailer available for you to drag, rotate, and place precisely where you\u2019d like it to end up on the image of the site.\n\nWhen you then activate the parking maneuver, it directs you what gears to select and handles all the steering to place the trailer as directed. It remains up to the driver and/or spotters to ensure the trailer doesn\u2019t it anything or anybody, though incorporating a trailer camera would also allow for object detection and potentially automatic emergency braking. Bosch is currently seeking customers for this purely software-defined feature.\n\nNote that we also got a demonstration of Bosch Trailer Assist, which is currently in production with Mercedes-Benz. This riff on Ford\u2019s trailer-backing system does away with the knob and simply using the screen allows you to select straight back or a right-angle reversing maneuver in either direction, or to a selectable angle either way. These software solutions are an invaluable stress-reducer to infrequent vacation trailer-tow drivers.\n\nCool Cockpit Concepts: Valeo Panovision\n\nPillar-to-pillar screens are all the rage nowadays, and Valeo Panovision is sort of a pillar-to-pillar HUD. It still uses three 15.9-inch thin-film transistor (TFT) screens, but they\u2019re mounted horizontally in the dash to reflect up onto a blackened stripe at the bottom of the windshield.\n\nA polarizing film ensures the display works with all legal polarized sunglasses. This has the effect of virtually placing the screen\u2019s focal length slightly in front of the windshield to reduce eye strain. The technology can even support passenger-only viewing of video content in motion by focusing the \u201ceye box\u201d of that screen.\n\nCool Cockpit Concepts: Valeo Dynamic Projection\n\nValeo Dynamic Projection works a little like those logo puddle lamps, but with higher resolution and full color. It was demonstrated on a dash-top area that might include an air vent and possibly some variable-function switches. The \u201cdisplay\u201d was shown delivering welcome messages, ADAS info, climate conditions, and buttons. Cost should be considerably less than that of producing an equivalent area as a touchscreen, which would disallow complex shapes and functions like incorporating a vent.\n\nElectrification: Magna Dedicated Hybrid Drive\n\nAt each supplier, the CEO or regional head\u2019s preamble stressed that they were ready and able to support any rebalancing of fully electric and hybrid drivetrain strategies. Magna\u2019s Dedicated Hybrid Drive (DHD) Duo is a two-motor hybrid transaxle concept currently in production in China and Europe, featuring a 187-hp primary and a 121-hp motor-generator unit. Used alone or with an electric helper axle, this solution supports a wide range of performance requirements.\n\nElectrification: Valeo\u2019s Smart eDrive\n\nSpeaking of helper axles, Valeo\u2019s Smart eDrive is pitched as a low-cost auxiliary drive unit that incorporates its own inverter and requires no external cooling. A smart oil pump circulates lubrication in such a way as to cool it via external air-cooling fins (just as early 911s were cooled).\n\nElectrification: Valeo\u2019s 6-in-1 E-Axle\n\nValeo\u2019s 6-in-1 E-Axle combines the motor, drive reduction, inverter, charger, DC-DC converter, and power-distribution functions into one unit that\u2019s reportedly scalable from 54 all the way up to 402 hp, using either permanent magnets or self-excited (copper-wound) rotors, with the latter featuring either brushed contacts (2027) or inductive power transmission (later). Valeo claims best-in-class efficiency and power density of 2 hp/pound. Valeo also showed what it claimed is the smallest 22-kW onboard charging unit, for those with a 100A home charger.\n\nElectrification: Magna Rotor Retaining Tabs\n\nMagna has vertically integrated production of its stator and rotor steel lamination plates and made some innovations. Reclaiming the valuable permanent magnets has been difficult in the past, in applications where they were retained by adhesive means, but by integrating small retaining tabs in the laminations, the magnets are held securely during their useful life and easier to extract at the end.\n\nElectrification: Magna Stator-Rotor Laminations\n\nMagna has also developed a novel dot-adhesive to keep each of the steel laminations (measuring 0.2 to 0.3mm thick) together during assembly. And finally, Magna has developed a multi-strike process allowing super-deep draw (6.3 inches deep) battery box with sharper corners both around the bottom (0.2-inch radius) and at the four vertical corners (3.0 inches), improving the volumetric efficiency of installed batteries (which tend to be quite square, as installed).\n\nLighting Concepts: Valeo Projector HUD CHMSL\n\nValeo lighting designers finally asked and answered the question \u201cwhy should we have to look at an unsightly center high-mount stop light (CHMSL) when it\u2019s not illuminated? Their solution is a Projector HUD CHMSL, in which extra bright illumination shines down onto the glass from a horizontally mounted source in the air deflector so that a following vehicle sees the full light (demonstrated with Audi Quattro branding) only when needed, during braking. It can even offer animation.\n\nLighting Concepts: Invision Adaptive Driving Beam\n\nSmart headlamps have been available globally for some time and they\u2019re headed here soon. These lamps can locally dim the high-beam pattern to prevent blinding drivers oncoming or directly ahead, and Magna displayed several offerings for use at differing price points, starting with 11-segment and 13-segment bi-matrix projectors for entry level; 24- and 60-segment projectors, on up to 16,000-pixel (4K resolution) beams that could conceivably project movies. All manufacturers are struggling to meet the road test portion of the standard, which requires thorough glare reduction for low cars, bikes, to lifted 4x4 trucks even when traversing bumps."

        "article_content": "Any long-time participant in the world of digital transformation will have seen the ebb and flow of technology trends many times. But nothing has quite captured the imagination \u2013 and anxiety \u2013 of business leaders, technologists, and the public like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIn recent years, we've seen AI emerge from the shadows as a transformative force across industries, promising to revolutionise business practices and drive significant economic benefits. Wild claims by technology leaders come as no surprise. However, when these are supported by economists, social commentators, and politicians, then it is time to sit up and take note.\n\nYet, despite the enthusiasm from AI advocates, a troubling reality with broader AI adoption is emerging. When engaging with organisations worldwide, you\u2019ll notice a growing disconnect between the initial excitement surrounding the theory of AI\u2019s impact and the realities of its implementation in practice. It\u2019s a gap we\u2019re increasingly seeing highlighted by business leaders and technology commentators. Is this a temporary stumbling block facing AI, or are we experiencing another disappointment for large-scale digital transformation?\n\nDelivering AI at scale To dig deeper into these issues, an important starting point is to recognise that advances in AI adoption are taking place within a much broader digital transformation context. The recent progress with AI-based tools and technologies is occurring after decades-long digital transformation efforts in most organisations. A wide variety of digital solutions have been brought into play requiring significant upheaval across every aspect of the organisation. Many of these changes involve small adjustments to current ways of working. However, as organisations began to adopt digital technologies to improve their core operating processes, they also have been forced to make more fundamental shifts across all their business activities. By encouraging a more disciplined approach to digital transformation, they have sought longer-term systemic change aimed at revolutionising the organisation\u2019s structure, strategy, skills and systems. \u201cIt takes no more than a cursory review of large-scale digital transformation efforts to recognise that managing change is hard\u201d Alan Brown For many organisations, adapting to digitally-driven change is nothing new. Indeed, it can be argued that all management is change management. Commentators such as Robert Schaffer believe that leaders should view change not as an occasional disruptor but as the very essence of their management job. However, traditional change management approaches often considered coping with disruption as being detached from \u201cnormal\u201d management tasks, treating it as a separate process that takes an organisation from one stable state to another. In digital transformation, where change is constant, such a perspective on change management can be very limiting. Instead, it must be considered the essence of management, with implications on all of an organisation\u2019s activities. Yet, it takes no more than a cursory review of large-scale digital transformation efforts to recognise that managing change is hard. Recent experiences such as those aimed at digitally transforming key aspects of UK government services reveal that the struggle to stay on top of the broad impacts of change can overwhelm even the most well-designed strategies. How can organisations define a meaningful approach to change that allows them to adapt to current AI-fuelled changes and prepare for the unexpected? An answer may be found by placing a fundamental focus on understanding and strengthening digital resilience.\n\nPerspectives on digital resilience Creating a strong plan is all very well. But, as often quoted, no plan survives first contact with the enemy. Hence, resilience plays a critical role in the success of any digital strategy. In the context of digital transformation, it is this resilience that determines the ability of an organisation to adapt, recover and thrive in the face of unexpected challenges, disruptions or changes in the digital landscape. But what does it mean to be resilient in the face of the kind of disruptive digital change we are experiencing with AI? The starting point for responding to this question is to examine the role of data as the foundation for AI. Data is the fuel for AI, and the utility of AI is directly related to the quality, accuracy and availability of that data. A resilient approach to the way data is gathered, stored, managed and maintained is essential.\n\nData resilience Smarter approaches to data-driven decision-making require organisations to build the capabilities needed to bring together multiple data sources, filter out errors in the data, extract meaningful insights from repeated patterns, and so on. Establishing a broad approach to data resilience enables the data-driven insight at the heart of machine intelligence (MI). It is the combination of capabilities provided by MI that transforms so much data into genuine sources of new value. It can be seen as a core capability for the digital economy. MI holds out the promise of being able to make sense of large volumes of data by exploiting a combination of machine learning and AI to yield entirely new sources of value. It encompasses natural language processing, image recognition, algorithmic design and other techniques to extract patterns, learn from these by assessing what they mean, and act upon them by connecting information together. MI is inevitably disruptive by nature. Hence, it is essential to recognise that MI and its associated digital business models may pose significant challenges, which can be addressed in the following ways. Changing the way data is collected and processed. It is important to move away from localised databases associated with specific applications and form larger data lakes that can be exploited by new layers of intelligence essential to MI success.\n\nEnsuring a flexible, scalable technology infrastructure across your organisation. Business success requires integrating the many applications that constitute a complex set of workflows by using open, component-based techniques as well as connected platforms such as those provided by Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, IBM and others.\n\nTackling cultural barriers across the organisation. Previous technology investment often constrained thinking and encouraged business leaders to cling on to ageing business models and supporting processes. New thinking is required. While many of these changes will be ongoing, MI-based innovations will inevitably put stress on existing organisational structures. Leadership is always a critical element of any major organisational change, and until the key business leaders are convinced of the need for radical change, little progress will be made. Companies as diverse as major technology providers, large-scale business-to-consumer services providers and industrial business-to-business solutions providers are already seeing the impact of such changes, illustrating that effective progress can be made when the corporate culture is receptive to new ideas.\n\nThe six faces of resilience for AI However important, data resilience on its own is insufficient. Digital transformation relies on a complex stack of technologies and practices to support change across the enterprise. In practice, we can identify an additional six distinct faces of resilience that must be addressed to ensure the success of delivering AI at scale. System resilience. Architecting systems and solutions to be fault tolerant, adaptive and able to fail gracefully when operating incorrectly or compromised. Cyber resilience. Ensuring that systems and data are protected from external threats and that information is exposed only through appropriate secure mechanisms. Information resilience. Creating governance and management processes for data to ensure that all information is accurate, appropriate and responsibly sourced. Organisational resilience. Establishing management and decision-making practices that enable rapid actions to be taken while conforming to all necessary laws, standards and guidelines. Operational resilience. Continuing to perform as expected as the operating environment changes, systems are degraded or stakeholder demands expand. People resilience. Supporting all employees and other stakeholders to perform at their best in the short term while sustaining their health and wellbeing over the longer term. All six of these perspectives on resilience are important considerations when moving to AI at scale, and together they form a framework for organisations to review their ability to manage change and sustain high performance in the context of the kinds of digital transformation that are being experienced with AI. Bringing these six angles together provides a holistic view of the challenges to be addressed, taking into account the broad impact of digital transformation in the age of AI.\n\nBend, don\u2019t break Based on such experiences, there are many ways in which resilience is found to be central to a successful AI-at-scale delivery strategy. To improve how digital transformation activities can become more resilient to change, the six perspectives listed above can be used to ask five key questions of any digital strategy. How prepared are we to adapt to change? The digital landscape constantly evolves, with new technologies, market trends and customer expectations emerging all the time. A resilient digital strategy enables organisations to quickly adapt to these changes by being flexible, agile and responsive. It allows businesses to seize new opportunities, reorganise resources to adapt to changing circumstances, and mitigate risks effectively. How well do we manage the risks associated with change? Resilience helps organisations identify and manage the risks associated with their digital initiatives. This includes assessing potential vulnerabilities, implementing robust security measures, and establishing backup plans in case of disruptions such as cyber attacks, system failures or natural disasters. A resilient digital strategy considers risk mitigation as an integral part of its implementation. What processes do we have in place to ensure continuity and recovery from disruptions? Resilience ensures business continuity by enabling an organisation to recover swiftly from disruptions. It involves having backup systems and redundancies in place to minimise downtime, data loss or customer impact. A resilient digital strategy incorporates disaster recovery plans, backup solutions and proactive monitoring to swiftly address any disruptions and restore normal operations. Where can we improve customer trust and satisfaction in how we manage change? Resilience is crucial for maintaining customer trust and satisfaction across all digital channels. When organisations provide uninterrupted services or products to their customers, it enhances their reputation and fosters customer loyalty. Resilience ensures that customer expectations are met even during unforeseen circumstances, which is crucial in today\u2019s interconnected and competitive digital landscape. How do we encourage positive change to drive innovation and growth? Resilience empowers those within an organisation to experiment and innovate, and to pursue digital transformation initiatives with confidence. It encourages a culture of learning from failures and setbacks, fostering a mindset of continuous improvement. A resilient digital strategy promotes exploration of new technologies, business models and opportunities for growth while enabling organisations to recover quickly from any setbacks along the way."
