            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s note: Welcome to the world of \u201cParanormal PA,\u201d a PennLive series that delves into Pennsylvania-grown stories of spirits; cryptids; oddities and legends; and the unexplained. Sign up here to get our Paranormal PA newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nBy all accounts, Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s life is pretty sweet.\n\nHe\u2019s immortal. He\u2019s got a great wife and kids. And his only job requirement is going outside once a year.\n\nBut before anyone poo-poos what many view as one of Pennsylvania\u2019s \u2014 or, indeed, the country\u2019s \u2014 more bizarre traditions, Paranormal Pa. will have you know that Phil is a product of a storied tradition (and superstition) that stretches back for years and years.\n\nGerman immigrants brought the tradition over when they settled in Pennsylvania hundreds of years ago. (AP Photo/Barry Reeger)AP\n\nThe Punsutawney Groundhog Club explains how the first time \u201cWeather Wags\u201d recognized Groundhog Day was in 1886, although the first official trek to Gobbler\u2019s Knob was the following year.\n\nBut the concept of having animals predict the weather goes way back before the 19th century. According to the Library of Congress Blogs, Groundhog Day\u2019s lineage can be traced back to ancient pre-Christian festivals celebrated by the Celts that served as midway points between equinoxes. Halloween \u2014 originally Samhain \u2014 falls into this category, too.\n\nFormerly known as \u201cImbolc\u201d before it eventually became the Christianized Candlemas, Groundhog Day was once considered the first day of spring. And while little is known about how the Celts celebrated the day, one traditional practice was attempting to divine the weather.\n\nNow, here\u2019s how animals figure into this: Ancient people used to observe animal behavior as part of their own farming practices, so the idea of watching how a groundhog to see whether or not spring was on its way makes sense.\n\nVisitPa.com adds how Roman legions, in their conquest of northern Europe, eventually spread the Candelmas Day tradition of candles being blessed and distributed. Those living in what\u2019s now Germany soon began to believe that if the sun made an appearance on the day, an animal who cast his shadow would predict six more weeks of cruddy weather.\n\nGroundhog Club President Tom Dunkel taps on the immortal groundhog's door so the weather oracle can make his prediction. (AP Photo/Barry Reeger)AP\n\nIn his book \u201cGroundhog Day (2003),\u201d Dan Yoder writes how the Germans who brought this tradition over to the U.S. used to watch badgers to see how far away spring was (the German folk expression for the holiday was \u201cDachstag,\u201d or \u201cBadger Day\u201d). Then somewhere along the line, that badger became a groundhog.\n\nNot to say that early Groundhog Day celebrations in Pennsylvania didn\u2019t maintain a bit of their mysticism: Yoder describes late 19th century celebrations of involving ritualized Groundhog Hunts in September which drew in \u201cdevotees from Pittsburgh and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nOne parade in 1909, as staged by the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, was deemed \u201cthe Circumgyratory Pageant of the Astrologers, Horoscopists, Magicians, Soothsayers, and Meteorological Attach\u00e9s of Punxsutawney Weather Works.\u201d A man named Clymer Freas \u2014 credited as conceiving of the idea for the holiday \u2014 even created \u201cGroundhogese,\u201d the language Groundhog Club presidents learn in order to discern the groundhog\u2019s annual predictions.\n\nThere may not be any more astrologists or soothsayers involved, but Groundhog Day remains a celebration: More than 30,000 people from across the globe drop by Knobbler\u2019s Creek on the day, getting up at the crack of dawn in the dead of winter to watch Phil make his prediction.\n\nTo be fair, though, even back in the day, people raised their eyebrows at the idea of watching a rodent predict how much longer winter would last.\n\n\u201cIn consequence, probably of having given all spiritual matters to the exclusive supervision of the clergy, newspaper editors are somewhat skeptical about many things which are popularly accepted with absolute faith,\u201d read an 1876 edition of the Harrisburg Daily Patriot.\n\n\u201cThis may account for the reason that some of them have failed to appreciate the sentiment\u2026in favor of a legal recognition of Ground Hog Day.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, editorial skepticism be damned, Groundhog Day won out, and did, indeed, spawn an industry. And inspired a Bill Murray movie. And tons of Punxsutawney wannabes like Staten Island Chuck, who did, it should be noted, tragically lost his life after former New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio quite literally fumbled him (never forget).\n\nYes, the holiday has come very far from its very old roots. And whether you\u2019re an eyebrow-raiser to the holiday or all-in, it doesn\u2019t look like Groundhog Day is going away any time soon.\n\nThat is, unless PETA has their way."

            "article_content": "In the first three episodes of the second season of Paramount+\u2019s supernatural teen drama series \u2018School Spirits,\u2019 the friends of Maddie Nears search for her without knowing that her body is possessed by Janet Hamilton. In addition, Xavier Baxter, the protagonist\u2019s former boyfriend, is even temporarily transported to the world of the dead. To make sense of what he sees during this short period, he goes through an online discussion portal named \u201cWeird Wisconsin,\u201d on which many talk about their experiences with anything or anyone paranormal. Meanwhile, Claire tries to find Maddie using a social media app named Snapati. They all also use a common internet browser named InQuest!\n\nWeird Wisconsin Does Not Exist in Reality\n\nWeird Wisconsin is a fictional discussion portal based in the Badger State that is dedicated to supernatural entities and paranormal occurrences. In \u2018School Spirits,\u2019 the web address to the portal is \u201chttp://weird-wisconsin.com/.\u201d However, the same won\u2019t lead you to any forum or active website. It is solely created as a part of Xavier\u2019s second-season storyline. However, the name \u201cWeird Wisconsin\u201d reminds us of Linda Godfrey and Richard D. Hendricks\u2019 travel guide with the same title. Originally published in 2005, the book explores some of the myths, legends, and alleged paranormal happenings or figures that shook the state, including Highway 13\u2019s Reptile Man and Madison\u2019s Loony Lawyer.\n\nInterestingly, \u201cWeird Wisconsin\u201d is also the name informally given to a collection of movies made by Bill Rebane, the filmmaker behind \u2018Monster a Go-Go\u2019 and \u2018The Giant Spider Invasion.\u2019 He is also reportedly credited as the creator of the Wisconsin Film Office. As far as the teen drama is concerned, the discussion portal must have been conceived to establish two major developments: Xavier\u2019s introduction to the world of the dead and his communication with Nicole. After his supernatural experience, he becomes more receptive towards Maddie\u2019s predicament, which happens when he reads the discussions in the portal.\n\nFurthermore, the portal also sets the stage for Xavier and Nicole\u2019s chats without them knowing the real identity of their respective chatmate. The bond they build as two anonymous users of Weird Wisconsin may turn out to be integral in the upcoming episodes of the second season.\n\nInQuest and Snapati Do Not Have Real-Life Counterparts\n\nSimilarly, InQuest and Snapati are applications that exist only in the fictional universe of \u2018School Spirits.\u2019 The former can be seen as a carbon copy of Google without even a complete web address. On the other hand, Snapati is, more or less, a clone of Instagram with a similar menu. Its icon, however, reminds us of Shazam rather than a social media application. The production department might have created these fictional apps because of several reasons, including trademark or licensing concerns.\n\nIn reality, an \u201cInQuest\u201d does exist, but it is a cyber security firm that is based in Austin, Texas, and releases products such as FileTAC, MailTAC, and InSights. Needless to say, neither the firm nor its products have any connection with the internet browser in the show. In the case of \u201cSnapati,\u201d the social media app does not even have a namesake connection with real life beyond its inspiration, Instagram. These fictional applications and the discussion portal contribute to the world-building within the narrative of the teen drama series. Even though they cannot be used by viewers, they succeed in leaving an impression among the audiences.\n\nRead More: Why Can Simon See Maddie in School Spirits, Explained"

The plan is for OpenAI to install its latest o-series models on Los Alamos\u2019 Venado supercomputer and set the massive machine to the task of helping solve some of the world\u2019s most existential and terrifying problems.\n\nLos Alamos listed the problems it expects the OpenAI-powered supercomputer to tackle:\n\nIdentifying new approaches to treating and preventing disease\n\nImproving U.S. security through improved detection of natural and man-made threats, such as biology and cyber, before they emerge\n\nAchieving a new era of U.S. energy leadership by unlocking the full potential of natural resources and revolutionizing the nation\u2019s energy infrastructure\n\nDeepening our understanding of the forces that govern the universe, from fundamental mathematics to high-energy physics\n\nEnhancing cybersecurity and protecting the American power grid\n\nAccelerating the basic science that underpins U.S. global technological leadership\n\nThe Venado is one of those massive supercomputers that dominates a room. It uses NVIDIA\u2019s advanced GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips and was built in partnership with NVIDIA and Hewlett-Packard Enterprises.\n\n\u201cAs threats to the nation become more complex and more pressing, we need new approaches and advanced technologies to preserve America\u2019s security,\u201d Thom Mason, Laboratory director of Los Alamos in a statement on its website. \u201cArtificial Intelligence models from OpenAI will allow us to do this more successfully, while also advancing our scientific missions to solve some of the nation\u2019s most important challenges.\u201d\n\nOpenAI has been cozying up to the government for a few years now, and it\u2019s been turbocharged under the Trump Presidency. Earlier this week, Altman announced ChatGPT Gov, a specialized version of its chatbot for government applications.\n\nLos Alamos and OpenAI have a relationship going back almost a year. Last summer, the pair announced a partnership that focused more narrowly on bioscience. At the time, Los Alamos told Gizmodo that it was optimistic but cautious about AI.\n\nIt emphasized that AI was a tool and that humans were the real threat, not the tools themselves. \u201cOur first pilot technology evaluation will look to understand how AI enables individuals to learn how to do protocols in the real world which will give us a better understanding of not only how it can help enable science but also whether it would enable a bad actor to execute a nefarious activity in the lab,\u201d Los Alamos said at the time.\n\nLos Alamos must have been impressed with OpenAI and its models, because now they\u2019ll be unleashed on some of the most pernicious and dangerous problems humanity faces."

We talked to local experts who mentioned everything from color to dining experiences as this season\u2019s trends, where couples revoke the traditional and instead prioritize the intentional.\n\nColor, Color, Color\n\nMinimalism is out, and bold, textured color that reflects a couple\u2019s personality is in. Textiles and fabrics can truly help liven up a space, and that\u2019s exactly what professionals in the wedding industry are expecting to see more of in 2025. Think less neutral, more personal, says Over the Moon Events & Experiences owner and creative director Krysta Stoddard. \u201cThere\u2019s so much freedom, design wise, when you start working with different elements and colors,\u201d she says. That can be anything from eccentric tablescapes covered in a dramatic textile to draping in uncommon colors and fabrics.\n\nDramatic Drapes\n\nAny space can be immediately transformed with draping, but a single sheath of chiffon isn\u2019t going to cut it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be steering away from the white and blushes, and instead people are getting adventurous and using more color,\u201d says Cristina Bentley, VP director of operations at Bella Vista Designs. \u201cAnd draping plays a huge part in that.\u201d Imagine an extra layer of elegance, where yards of deep green velvet or vibrant patterns help transform spaces into something lush and luxurious.\n\nBella Vista Designs, a premier production company that just celebrated 20 years in business, has been doing draping since day one. \u201cA trend that we\u2019re seeing with draping is a lot of asymmetries \u2014 so it\u2019s not just a flat wall \u2026 [but] very eclectic layers on top of layers,\u201d says Bentley.\n\nDrapery drama by Bella Vista Designs | Credit: James and Jess Photography\n\nIntentional Design\n\nThis year, with color playing a huge factor in design, there\u2019s a shift from traditional to personal. That\u2019s reflected in nontraditional color palettes, but also in every element throughout the event; people are not just going to offer gifts because they\u2019ve been told to. Instead, says Tyler Speier of Tyler Speier Events, couples are requesting \u201creally intentional pieces that tell a story.\u201d\n\nThose high-touch elements can appear in the form of elaborate lighting like huge lantern or globe installations, or custom dance floors that tie the whole space together. \u201cI think people are going to start getting really creative with their dance floors,\u201d says Stoddard. Vendors like RCD Dance Floors can incorporate a monogram or introduce a vinyl overlay that matches a color or floral scheme to transform the space.\n\nDress Codes\n\nGone are the days where guests just show up for the ceremony, a meal, and maybe a dance. Couples are planning weekend-long celebrations for everyone; think coordinated hikes, yoga retreats, and wine tastings. With fewer and fewer couples asking friends and family to be part of the \u201cofficial\u201d wedding party, says Stoddard, dress codes and color palettes for three days of activities means everyone is part of the wedding. \u201cNot only is the bride, groom, or anyone in the bridal party going to make some fashion statement, but I think people are going to start giving mood boards or dress codes to their guests,\u201d she says.\n\nInteractive Experiences\n\nFor much of the population getting hitched, they\u2019ve placed a particular emphasis on experience. Couples are vying for grabbing guests\u2019 attention in a world of ephemeral design, which translates to more interactive wedding experiences. \u201cThe focus is so much on the experience,\u201d says Speier, that everything down to the smells, sounds, and tastes is being curated.\n\nTraditionally, says Speier, the festivities centered around the dance floor at the reception. Today, weddings are steering more toward \u201csexier, elevated dinner parties,\u201d he says, which translates to separate rooms for cocktail hour, dancing, and dinner \u2014 each with its own \u201cwow moment.\u201d That experiential moment can come in the shape of a poet with a vintage typewriter coming to cocktail hour or custom scent bars or upscale taco bars like Nomada or oyster bars where chefs shuck.\n\nContent Creators\n\nAs we mentioned last year, industry experts expect the demand for content creators to rise. In line with the desire to create a \u201cfeeling,\u201d on-site content creators can give couples something others can\u2019t: real-time content. Capturing the real-life moments allows for everyone to put down their phones and be more present \u2014 a feeling that will enhance the overall guest experience."

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nWeb client runtime security (WCRS) refers to the security or behavior of the code executed in users' internet browsers during their web interactions. The first part of this article series includes details of why WCRS as a security discipline warrants specific focus in addition to traditional web application security practices. Traditional approaches to web application security have often focused on scanning code for vulnerabilities, as well as scanning and monitoring for security weaknesses from the perspective of the web hosting provider.\n\nThis second article describes the limitations of traditional security solutions in addressing WCRS risk and proposes implementation options for purpose-built security solutions. Specifically, the strengths and limitations of three key traditional application security mechanisms are covered, before proposing certain viable implementation options for addressing WCRS needs. These mechanisms include static analysis, dynamic analysis, and manual code reviews, each offering unique benefits and challenges in the context of web application security.\n\nStatic Application Security Testing\n\nStatic application security testing (SAST)1 involves analyzing source code for vulnerabilities while the application is being developed or analyzing any code changes that are made to an existing application. This is a traditional approach to code scanning that is utilized by many organizations. SAST can catch many vulnerabilities before applications are released into production. Some vendor products generate a report of potential vulnerabilities. Others go a step further, by scanning code while a developer is typing, and highlighting potential problems in the integrated development environment. After reviewing the vulnerability report produced by one of these tools, developers might go through multiple code remediation and re-scanning cycles until a passing scan is achieved. This approach is beneficial for early vulnerability detection, allowing developers to address issues before the code is deployed. Figure 1 summarizes the pros and cons of SAST.\n\nFigure 1 \u2014 Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Considerations\n\n\n\nHowever, SAST does not account for runtime behaviors or interactions with dynamically loaded scripts, which are common in modern web applications. As a result, vulnerabilities introduced through third-party scripts or supply chain attacks can go undetected. SAST tools are designed to assess code as it is written, not as it is executed in the varied web application environments, limiting their effectiveness in addressing WCRS threats.\n\nStrengths\u2014SAST analyzes source code for vulnerabilities, offering early detection during the development phase.\n\nLimitations\u2014SAST does not cover runtime behaviors or interactions with dynamically loaded scripts. It may also not detect vulnerabilities introduced through third-party scripts or supply chain attacks.\n\nDynamic Application Security Testing\n\nDynamic application security testing (DAST)2 involves testing applications in their running state and simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities. This method provides insights into application behavior while under attack and can uncover issues that static analysis might miss. Many organizations supplement their SAST processes with DAST because DAST scans can detect vulnerabilities in the deployed environment, which would not be evident from reviewing application code. Server misconfigurations, weak authentication, and security headers are some examples of vulnerabilities detected by DAST scans. The pros and cons of DAST are depicted in figure 2.\n\nFigure 2 \u2014 Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Considerations\n\n\n\nDAST has its limitations, particularly in detecting vulnerabilities that manifest only in specific web client runtime environments. Malicious code can evade DAST by activating only under certain conditions that the testing environment does not replicate. Additionally, DAST cannot fully understand and evaluate the behavior of third-party scripts, rendering it less effective against the threats that exploit these external dependencies. Last, DAST scans are detective by nature, offering few preventive capabilities that would protect organizations during supply chain attacks at runtime.\n\nStrengths\u2014DAST tests applications in their running state, simulating real-world attacks.\n\nLimitations\u2014DAST might miss vulnerabilities that only manifest in specific web client runtime environments. Malicious code can hide from DAST by only executing in specific user contexts, and DAST does not provide real-time protection from unwanted script behavior.\n\nInteractive Application Security Testing\n\nInteractive application security testing (IAST)3 combines elements of SAST and DAST by analyzing applications in real time during normal operations. This method allows for more comprehensive detection of vulnerabilities by observing code execution and interactions from within the application, as opposed to external DAST scanning. It enables organizations to detect issues that may go unnoticed by SAST or DAST, such as vulnerabilities arising from specific application workflows or interactions between components. Figure 3 depicts relevant IAST considerations for organizations.\n\nFigure 3 \u2014 Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) Consideration\n\n\n\nWhile IAST provides deeper insights compared to purely static or dynamic testing, it still faces challenges in WCRS. IAST tools require integration into the application, which can be complex and resource intensive. Moreover, they may not fully capture the behavior of third-party scripts or adequately monitor client-side code that executes in user browsers, limiting their effectiveness in preventing client-side attacks.\n\nStrengths\u2014IAST combines elements of SAST and DAST by analyzing applications in real time during normal operations.\n\nLimitations\u2014IAST tools require integration into the application, which can be complex and may not detect client-side script vulnerabilities introduced by third parties.\n\nTraditional Security Mechanisms are Limited\n\nSAST, DAST, IAST, and other traditional security tools, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems are limited by their perspective of application and infrastructure runtime states from a provider\u2019s point of view. They might inspect the observable network traffic between client web browsers and the trusted private hosting environment where much of the web application content might be hosted. However, these tools may overlook unintentional data leaks between client browsers and third-party services, as well as Magecart attacks that could exploit these trusted third-party services. The gaps in coverage of the traditional security tools are illustrated as potential risk in figure 4.\n\nFigure 4 \u2014 WCRS Limitations of Traditional Security Solutions\n\n\n\nThese limitations underscore the need for specialized client-side security solutions. Such specialized solutions should examine runtime states from a client\u2019s perspective and address the unique challenges of securing client-side code.\n\nTechnology Solutions for WCRS\n\nAs traditional application security mechanisms or approaches do not provide necessary safeguards against WCRS risk, organizations may need to consider other options for their WCRS capabilities. This section proposes certain mechanisms, each of which may have distinct approaches and corresponding benefits.\n\nThe web client-side security market has witnessed significant growth in recent years, driven by the increasing recognition of the risk associated with third-party scripts and supply chain attacks. This rapidly maturing space features a variety of solutions, each with distinct approaches and benefits.\n\nOrganizations should evaluate each approach carefully before selecting the most suitable options for their specific website contexts.\n\nCDN and Proxy-Based Solutions\n\nMany internet-facing web applications are already deployed behind content delivery networks (CDNs) to protect them from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and improve performance by caching content closer to end users. Given their strategic position in the delivery chain, CDN providers are well-suited to enhance client-side security by examining all resources before they reach client browsers. By intercepting and analyzing web traffic, CDNs can identify and block malicious scripts, ensuring that only safe and verified content is delivered.\n\nCDN and proxy-based solutions offer a transparent layer of security without requiring significant changes to existing infrastructure. This transparency is a major advantage, as it simplifies deployment and reduces the burden on development and operations teams.\n\nThese solutions typically feature a web-based portal that offers near real-time visibility into the resources loaded by clients. Through this portal, customers can monitor scripts and other elements being delivered to end users.\n\nStrengths\u2014 CDN and proxy-based solutions require minimal effort for the initial deployment if monitored web applications are already protected by the CDN solution from DDoS attacks. In such cases, the CDN provider is already able to monitor web traffic, and the client security module is simply enabled by the third-party CDN provider upon purchase. This solution also avoids the introduction of third-party code into web applications, often shortening implementation timelines and avoiding delays due to vetting by other cybersecurity and third-party risk teams within the purchasing organization.\n\nLimitations\u2014Visibility of third-party script behavior is limited to data transmitted via the CDN network and is not always representative of third-party script behavior on customer browsers, particularly once they begin interacting with the web application. Furthermore, this solution is only offered by a limited number of CDN providers. Internally facing applications, including traffic that is not routed through a particular CDN, would require a different approach for client-side protection.\n\nRemote Scanning Solutions\n\nRemote scanning solutions provide an external perspective on the security of web applications by assessing them from outside the organization\u2019s network. These tools are designed to identify vulnerabilities and malicious code that may be present in the client-side scripts and resources delivered to users. By periodically loading and crawling an internet-facing web application, remote scanners can detect and analyze scripts, security headers, and other resources that would be loaded by client browsers while interacting with a monitored web application, offering a simplified view with minimal effort from customers.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of remote scanning is its ease of implementation. Since these tools operate externally, they require minimal configuration and do not require updates to the existing infrastructure or code. Remote scanning can quickly provide a high-level overview of the security posture of web applications, highlighting areas of concern that require further investigation. However, while remote scanning is effective at identifying many common vulnerabilities, it has its limitations. For example, it may struggle to access and analyze content behind authentication barriers, and sophisticated malicious code can sometimes hide from these scans by only activating under specific conditions.\n\nRemote scanning solutions often include a web-based interface that offers detailed reports on the findings. These reports provide insights into the resources that would be loaded by client browsers. Customers can justify the presence of certain scripts, ensuring that they are necessary for enterprise operations while maintaining compliance. Additionally, these tools can notify users of any changes to the scripts or security headers, enabling timely responses to new risk and maintaining the integrity of client-side security measures.\n\nStrengths\u2014Remote scanning solutions are easy to implement and provide a basic, limited view into a monitored web application.\n\nLimitations\u2014Limited visibility and accuracy can lead to potential blind spots, especially when dealing with sophisticated threats. Resources that require user login, or those requiring more complicated actions from users before they are loaded and executed, may be overlooked. Furthermore, this solution offers no protection or remediation capabilities, as it is used for detection only.\n\nVendor Solutions Based on CSP Headers\n\nThe HTTP Content Security Policy (CSP) response header, universally supported by modern web browsers, provides advanced client-side security capabilities. Web applications can instruct client browsers via detailed policies on what resources are necessary parts of a web application and which safe locations they can be loaded from. Web browsers can also be instructed to block or report unexpected behavior.\n\nIn their simpler form, WCRS solutions may leverage a custom CSP header directive that does not directly block any suspicious behavior and simply instructs all client browsers to report what content was loaded in near real time. Dashboards display script inventories and observe script behavior for monitored applications. Many vendor solutions will take this a step further, leveraging proprietary and open-source threat intelligence feeds to alert their customers to any known malicious content and behavior. To further protect their customers, some vendor solutions will suggest more advanced CSPs that could be implemented in \u201cprevent mode\u201d. This mode will automatically block unexpected scripts. However, this option works best for simple web applications managed by technically savvy organizations due to the complexity and operational stability risk.\n\nIntegrating CSP headers requires customers to modify their web applications, which can delay implementation. Despite this, the header directive is transparent in its function and does not necessitate extensive vetting. By providing accurate and timely reporting without the need for more complex vendor-provided script integration, CSP header-based monitoring offers a balanced solution that enhances security while keeping code changes minimal and transparent to customers.\n\nStrengths\u2014CSP headers provide accurate real-time reporting of resources and scripts executed by client browsers. This solution requires minimal changes to the web application code.\n\nLimitations\u2014CSP headers require basic changes to the web application, which may necessitate change control, testing, and approvals. These necessary steps may delay implementation. Moreover, implementation of optional custom CSP policies may only work well for simple web applications, as these policies are often much more complex and can cause operational impact. They can block external resources and other essential web application functionality if they are not explicitly approved ahead of time.\n\nSolutions Based on Custom Vendor-Provided JavaScript\n\nMany WCRS solutions require monitored applications to include custom JavaScript provided by the vendor. This option introduces risk and can extend timelines for approval and vetting. However, despite these challenges, it provides additional granular visibility of script behavior at the data element level and enables dynamic policy evaluation and enforcement.\n\nThis approach allows for the implementation of script behavior policies, which go beyond the detection and reporting of unauthorized script behaviors and actively block unwanted actions in real time. For example, certain scripts can be authorized to access credit card fields and/or perform keystroke logging, while all others are denied from performing such actions. Vendor-provided JavaScript solutions can dynamically adjust policies based on the ongoing evaluation of script behaviors, enabling more proactive and robust client-side security controls.\n\nImplementing CSP headers with custom JavaScript requires significant changes to the web application, necessitating rigorous change control, testing, and approvals. Although preparations for this solution tend to be robust, its ability to provide granular control and advanced security features makes it a compelling choice for organizations that require high levels of WCRS.\n\nStrengths\u2014This solution offers granular real-time visibility and control over client-side resources at the data element level. It also offers dynamic policy evaluation and enforcement, including advanced security measures such as data firewalls.\n\nLimitations\u2014This solution\u2019s granular nature requires slightly more significant changes to web applications, leading to longer timelines for vetting third-party vendor code, approval, and implementation. To this end, vendor JavaScript code must be trusted by all monitored applications, introducing additional supply chain risk.\n\nVendor Solution Summary\n\nThere are several options available for organizations looking to gain better insights and control over WCRS, depending on organizational security needs. These options\n\nFigure 5 \u2014 Web Client Runtime Security Integration Options\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nOrganizations may consider the pros and cons of each of the above options before selecting solutions for their WCRS objectives. It may be the case that a single solution may not suit every website and organization, given the likely differences in the criticality of the business functions supported by the websites and the sensitivity of the information processed.\n\nThe next and final article (part 3) in this series will cover certain guidelines that organizations may find useful in operationalizing their WCRS programs.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 OWASP, Static Application Security Testing (SAST)\n\n2 OWASP, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)\n\n3 OWASP, Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)\n\nSergei Vasilevsky, CISSP\n\nIs the founder and president of ILIAM Consulting.

            "article_content": "Kore.ai unveils no-code platform for creating and deploying knowledge-based agentic AI\n\nKore.ai, a global leader in enterprise AI, is debuting AI for Process, a no-code, agentic AI platform designed to streamline knowledge-intensive, complex business processes. With AI for Process, enterprises can quickly build, deploy, and manage custom AI agents, or Agentic Apps at scale, that can understand context, make complex decisions, and more.\n\nAutonomous AI agents have struggled to implement its value in highly intricate operations and do so at scale, according to Kore.ai. AI for Process aims to rectify this challenge, transforming rules-based process automation to intelligent process orchestration.\n\n\"Traditional enterprise process automation was limited by rigid, rule-based systems lacking any autonomy,\" said Raj Koneru, CEO and founder of Kore.ai. \"With the advent of advanced AI models capable of evaluation and reasoning, we\u2019re ushering in a new era where intelligent AI agents can independently manage business processes, reducing over-reliance on human support. AI for Process enables enterprises to design scalable, reliable Agentic Apps that redefine efficiency while elevating humans into more strategic, supervisory roles.\"\n\nThrough the help of proprietary agentic RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), AI for Process combines advanced retrieval with intelligent agent orchestration to deliver highly accurate, contextual AI agent technology. Paired with a no-code, highly intuitive visual workflow designer that comes with over 65 pre-built prompt templates, enterprises can achieve the promises of agentic AI with ease.\n\nSpecialized agents work together to intelligently execute a variety of knowledge-based tasks. For example, the Orchestrator Agent coordinates workflows while Reasoning Agents handle complex decision-making; the Task Agents automate workflows, Knowledge Agents process enterprise information, and API Agents manage system integrations.\n\nEach agent is centralized under an advanced Agent Evaluation Framework, ensuring that agents are continuously assessed and analyzed for utmost efficiency and alignment. Furthermore, Kore.ai\u2019s human-in-the-loop strategy incorporates human touchpoints within automated workflows, enabling asynchronous human actions, approvals, and form inputs.\n\nAdditionally, AI for Process seamlessly integrates with commercial and open source large language models (LLMs), as well as major cloud providers\u2014including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud\u2014eliminating vendor lock-in. Kore.ai\u2019s solution offers pre-built connectors for enterprise data sources and APIs and delivers real-time data synchronization across systems.\n\nAs far as security and governance, AI for Process features data anonymization, protection against prompt injection attacks, custom content filters, and audit trails, as well as centralized governance controls for managing role-based access and AI guardrails.\n\n\u201cThe future of enterprise operations lies in AI agents collaborating to manage and optimize processes under human supervision,\u201d said Prasanna Arikala, CTO and head of products at Kore.ai. \u201cThese agents will operate autonomously, seamlessly discovering and working with each other. Achieving this vision requires a robust AI agent platform integrating autonomous agents, advanced knowledge retrieval, and intelligent orchestration. With AI for Process, we\u2019re delivering these future-ready capabilities today.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about AI for Process, please visit https://kore.ai/.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."

            "article_content": "Top of the Champions League table and into the last 16 with the most money banked.\n\nThis was the perfect return to Europe\u2019s elite competition for Liverpool, setting up Arne Slot\u2019s side for a crack at lifting the trophy for a seventh time and significantly boosting the club\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nAfter recording seven wins out of eight games, Liverpool are closing in on at least \u20ac100million (\u00a383.8m; $104m) in Champions League prize money alone, with a further \u20ac56.5m still to play for. Factor in the additional matchday revenue that big fixtures at Anfield bring \u2014 the club earn between \u00a33m and \u00a34m for each home game, with sellout crowds as good as guaranteed \u2014 and the importance of being back in Europe\u2019s premier competition after a year away becomes clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlot will rightly focus on his side\u2019s positive on-field performances, which included memorable victories against Real Madrid, Milan and Bayer Leverkusen, but the influx of such a large amount of cash will fuel the angst among the fans who want to see greater investment from Fenway Sports Group (FSG, the club\u2019s owner).\n\nSeeing that money flow in certainly makes it harder for FSG to stick so resolutely to its careful approach to spending. Such prudence could easily be justified last season, when Liverpool were playing in the Europa League while building the new Anfield Road End (which took capacity to over 60,000), but less so now.\n\nYet history suggests that more money coming into the club does not always equate to a big investment in the squad. FSG places sustainability at the heart of its operations and prefers to wait for the right player to become available, rather than being lured into overspending. An example came last summer with Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi: he was Liverpool's top transfer target but, when that deal could not be done, they opted not to go for an alternative in his defensive midfield position.\n\nThere is no sign it will stretch the club beyond its means anytime soon, despite seeing the value of its asset multiply considerably since its \u00a3300m takeover in 2010.\n\nLiverpool were the lowest spenders in last summer's transfer window, signing only Federico Chiesa for a deal worth up to \u00a312.5m. A \u00a329m deal for goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili was also agreed, although he stayed at Valencia until the end of this season, and with four days of the current transfer window remaining, Liverpool are yet to do any business.\n\nFederico Chiesa was Liverpool's only summer arrival (Jan Kruger/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cPeople haven\u2019t seen us do a lot in the transfer window but we\u2019re happy with the squad,\" Slot told the BBC this week. \"In the background, we are working on strengthening the squad for the summer. That would mean that for the upcoming years, we will be able to challenge for every trophy we are playing for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKey to the future are also the three soon-to-be out-of-contract players \u2014 Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk \u2014 available to discuss free moves away this summer when their deals expire.\n\nSalah, Alexander-Arnold and Van Dijk have been offered extensions but are yet to agree terms. Tension among the Anfield crowd continues to grow, with a recent banner reading, \u201cNow give Mo his dough,\u201d referencing the importance of FSG securing Salah beyond this season.\n\nOf course such negotiations aren\u2019t that simple. Neither is it as straightforward to suggest that now Liverpool are doing well in the Champions League again, they should break from a structure that, despite criticism, has served them well over the years.\n\nThere is still a little catching up to do, too. Liverpool dropped a place in the annual Deloitte Football Money League this year as the impact of no Champions League football last season was laid bare.\n\nAccording to the figures, which are expected to be backed up when the club's official accounts are released, total revenue was up to around \u20ac714m, an increase on the previous season, which had stood at \u00a3594m. Much of that was down to a \u20ac45m increase in commercial revenue and a \u20ac29m boost to matchday revenue, helped by the opening of the new Anfield Road Stand.\n\nA \u20ac42m drop in broadcast revenue, however, highlighted the missed opportunity in the Champions League and allowed Arsenal to leapfrog Liverpool in the standings.\n\nThat Liverpool are back in the competition and the favourites to win it, is a good start to the recovery. Never before has it been more important to be in the competition than now with the prize pot bubbling away.\n\nAnfield makes huge sums for every home game (Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nA 22 per cent increase in the money distributed from UEFA this year means that if Liverpool lift the trophy in May they can expect to earn around \u20ac160m. First they will have to progress through the last-16 against either Paris Saint-Germain, Benfica, Monaco or Brest. But even finishing as a runner-up or semi-finalist may be enough to record Liverpool's most profitable season in Europe, largely because of their early form and history in the competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs The Athletic's Phil Buckingham explained in more detail, the prize pot is split in three ways: first through an equal share (\u20ac18.62m for each club), then performance-related extras before a third part \u2014 a new 'value pillar' shaped by market pools and coefficients \u2014 completes the total.\n\nWe already know what some of these figures are in advance so they can be totted up along the way. Each win is worth \u20ac2.1m, with a draw bringing \u20ac700,000, then additional payments are made for the final league position, qualifying for the last 16 (\u20ac11m), the quarter-finals (\u20ac12.5m), the semi-finals (\u20ac15m) and the final (\u20ac18.5m). The winners also get \u20ac6.5m, as well as an additional \u20ac4m for featuring in the following season's European Super Cup.\n\nLiverpool's total for performance payments currently stands at almost \u20ac40m. The value pillar is the more complex of the three and relates to the size of each club\u2019s domestic TV deal and historical performances in Europe. Liverpool were among the highest and are expected to bring in around \u20ac40million, which, added to their on-field performance, represents a good start to 2025.\n\nThe club's accountants will be thrilled, and Slot himself does not seem to be agitating for the kind of spending that some of his Premier League rivals are indulging in.\n\nBut given the sums pouring in, another quiet summer would lead to more awkward questions being asked of FSG and its long-term ambitions.\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"

            "article_content": "Fresh on the heels of a controversy in which ChatGPT-maker OpenAI accused the Chinese company behind DeepSeek R1 of using its AI model outputs against its terms of service, OpenAI's largest investor, Microsoft, announced on Wednesday that it will now host DeepSeek R1 on its Azure cloud service.\n\nDeepSeek R1 has been the talk of the AI world for the past week because it is a freely available simulated reasoning model that reportedly matches OpenAI's o1 in performance\u2014while allegedly being trained for a fraction of the cost.\n\nAzure allows software developers to rent computing muscle from machines hosted in Microsoft-owned data centers, as well as rent access to software that runs on them.\n\n\"R1 offers a powerful, cost-efficient model that allows more users to harness state-of-the-art AI capabilities with minimal infrastructure investment,\" wrote Microsoft Corporate Vice President Asha Sharma in a news release.\n\nDeepSeek R1 runs at a fraction of the cost of o1, at least through each company's own services. Comparative prices for R1 and o1 were not immediately available on Azure, but DeepSeek lists R1's API cost as $2.19 per million output tokens, while OpenAI's o1 costs $60 per million output tokens. That's a massive discount for a model that performs similarly to o1-pro in various tasks.\n\nPromoting a controversial AI model\n\nOn its face, the decision to host R1 on Microsoft servers is not unusual: The company offers access to over 1,800 models on its Azure AI Foundry service with the hopes of allowing software developers to experiment with various AI models and integrate them into their products. In some ways, whatever model they choose, Microsoft still wins because it's being hosted on the company's cloud service."

            "article_content": "ChatGPT developer OpenAI and other players in the generative AI business were caught unawares this week by a Chinese company named DeepSeek, whose open source R1 simulated reasoning model provides results similar to OpenAI's best paid models (with some notable exceptions) despite being created using just a fraction of the computing power.\n\nSince ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and other generative AI models first became publicly available in late 2022 and 2023, the US AI industry has been undergirded by the assumption that you'd need ever-greater amounts of training data and compute power to continue improving their models and get\u2014eventually, maybe\u2014to a functioning version of artificial general intelligence, or AGI.\n\nThose assumptions were reflected in everything from Nvidia's stock price to energy investments and data center plans. Whether DeepSeek fundamentally upends those plans remains to be seen. But at a bare minimum, it has shaken investors who have poured money into OpenAI, a company that reportedly believes it won't turn a profit until the end of the decade.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman concedes that the DeepSeek R1 model is \"impressive,\" but the company is taking steps to protect its models (both language and business); OpenAI told the Financial Times and other outlets that it believed DeepSeek had used output from OpenAI's models to train the R1 model, a method known as \"distillation.\" Using OpenAI's models to train a model that will compete with OpenAI's models is a violation of the company's terms of service.\n\n\"We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the US government to protect the most capable models being built here,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told Ars.\n\nSo taking data without permission is bad, now?\n\nI'm not here to say whether the R1 model is the product of distillation. What I can say is that it's a little rich for OpenAI to suddenly be so very publicly concerned about the sanctity of proprietary data."

            "article_content": "Analysts warn that stretched valuations and weakening credit cycles signal further downside risks.\n\nHeightened volatility, an FII sell-off, and tightening liquidity have caused the markets to enter a sharp corrective territory. However, the small- and mid-cap segment of the equities has taken a sharper fall compared to their large-cap peers, falling as much as 15 percent since the end of September.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe BSE400 small and midcap index is poised for its fifth 20 percent-plus correction post-GFC.\n\nIs this a blip or a bear market?\n\nHowever, is this fall a blip or a serious correction? According to analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities, this downturn could be the beginning of a bear market as domestic growth slows and durable liquidity slips into a deficit. Further, despite the 15 percent correction, SMID valuations are still high.\n\nThe past corrections can be classified as blips, such as those seen in 2015\u201316 and 2021\u201322 or bear markets, which was seen in 2011\u201313 and 2018\u201319.\n\nAs per Nuvama Institutional Equities, blips are short-lived, lasting two\u2013three quarters as SMIDs fall in line with large-caps. On the other hand, bear markets are prolonged correction phases with a 30\u201340 percent correction over two\u2013three years and large underperformance to the Nifty 50 and Sensex.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nDuring blips, all sectors decline, with little difference in sectoral performance. However, during bear markets cyclicals (real estate and industrials) tend to experience large underperformance and usually tend to correct by more than 50 percent.\n\nFurther, the brokerage noted that SMIDs are more exposed to the domestic economy than large-caps. Thus, it is only when domestic growth slackens do SMIDs tend to experience bear market and correct.\n\n\"The best way to assess the same is by looking at the domestic credit cycle and exports trend. If the credit cycle is weakening, then it is a sign of domestic weakness in which SMIDs will invariably underperform,\" said Nuvama analysts.\n\nBear markets are preceded by large 5Y returns (20 percent or above) while blips occur in the initial phases of bull markets and tend to have 10\u201315 percent 5Y returns in the run-up. Therefore, bear markets typically occur when domestic credit slows, liquidity tightens and midcaps experience a strong five-year rally on an absolute as well as relative basis.\n\nAlso Read | Budget cheer coming for railways? RVNL, Railtel, other rail stocks surge ahead of Budget 2025\n\nBlips on the other hand are an outcome of global weakness while domestic growth and liquidity conditions are generally stable. Furthermore, they are not preceded by a large medium-term rally.\n\nSo is this current correction a blip or bear market? Most signs point towards the SMIDs space entering a bear market. Domestic growth that is slackening this, which is evident in the credit cycle, while it was strong in 2023, in H1CY24 it has experienced a sharp moderation.\n\nAlso, excluding BFSI, SMID earnings are now underperforming large-cap peers and have moved into contraction. \"In fact, even in the Q3FY25 results season so far, SMID earnings have been disappointing and experienced large downgrades,\" noted the brokerage.\n\nThe performance of SMIDs relative to the Nifty 50 have been the highest in a post GFC-world. Even after the correction, they remain quite elevated \u2013 a trend that is typically observed in market corrections preceding bear markets.\n\nWith a sharp run up comes stretched valuations. Even, after the 15 percent correction, valuations are higher than the previous peaks.\n\nWay forward\n\nAs domestic growth is slackening, liquidity conditions are tightening and valuations as well as 5Y returns are quite elevated, Nuvama Institutional Equities believes there could be risks of a bear market. \"These have higher resemblance to the 2011\u201313 and 2018\u201319 phases. Thus, it is perhaps not yet a time to buy the dip,\" noted analysts.\n\nThe reversal from the previous bear markets, especially in 2018\u201319, was due to the US Federal Reserve. Hence, it is very important to monitor Fed actions and global liquidity hereon, as that will shape the SMIDs outcome.\n\nInvestors should maintain a very low beta bias as growth is still subdued and liquidity remains tight. \"In sectors, where margins are close to cyclical lows, and demand has stabilised, we think consolidation/costs focus could happen and those stocks/sectors could see larger upside,\" said Nuvama, adding, \"Despite the sharp correction, we recommend avoiding cyclical exposure in SMID portfolio.\"\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

            "article_content": "A recent study conducted by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay analyzed the financial impact of floods and cyclones across 25 states in India. The study, which covers a span of 23 years (1995\u20132018), highlights how the damage caused by these natural disasters severely affects the states\u2019 budgets on an annual basis. The research also offers solutions for better disaster preparedness and economic protection, providing a roadmap to help mitigate the financial repercussions of such crises.\n\nPublished in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, the study titled, \u2018The impact of floods and cyclones on fiscal arrangements in India: An empirical investigation at the sub-national level\u2019 is conducted by Nandini Suresh,a research scholar with the Center for Climate Studies, IIT Bombay, Professor Trupti Mishra, and Professor D. Parthasarathy of IIT Bombay.\n\nAlso Read | Natural disasters caused 2.5 million internal displacements in India in 2022, report says\n\nTraditionally, disaster response funding relies on estimating the cost of damages based on evaluating economic losses, the number of deaths, and the number of people affected. \u201cThese evaluations are often inconsistent and biased,\u201c Ms. Suresh said. \u201cWe relied on data from weather and geographic sources [IBTrACS and the India Meteorological Department] to accurately measure cyclone strength [using wind speeds] and flood severity [based on unusual rainfall],\u201d she explained.\n\nBy combining this information, the researchers created a Disaster Intensity Index (DII), ensuring all types of disasters are treated fairly. This method avoids inconsistencies and biases and gives a clearer picture of disaster impacts, especially for floods and cyclones, which caused 80% of disaster-related losses in India during the study period.\n\nThe study uses a statistical model called panel Vector Auto Regression (VAR) to examine how revenue and expenditure affect each other from one year to the next few years. The model allows accounting for differences between states and ensures that past economic conditions do not unfairly influence disaster severity measurements, giving a reliable way to study the financial impacts of disasters.\n\nAlso Read | Wanted: a strategy to turn climate research into disaster management\n\nThe findings from the study show that disasters put a heavy financial burden on the affected States by increasing their expenditure while also reducing their revenue. As a result, the States allocate substantial funds for immediate relief efforts such as evacuation, medical aid, food, and shelter. The government also invests in rebuilding essential infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and homes. As agriculture, trade, and business operations are frequently disrupted by these disasters, tax collection and income from these sectors also decline.\n\nThe study highlights a cycle in which increased expenditures and falling revenues lead to significant budget deficits.\n\nMs. Mishra said, \u201cHowever, the DII shows that disasters impact States differently. Less disaster-prone States like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which experience droughts and occasional floods, can handle relief with their own resources and suffer less financial damage. The disaster intensity is not high enough to affect people\u2019s income or production; hence, there is no decrease in tax or non-tax revenues. On the other hand, disaster-prone coastal States like Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal, which frequently experience cyclones and floods, have higher recovery expenses and higher revenue losses. As a result, they often need to rely on external funding like loans, increasing state debt and making it difficult to fund other development projects.\u201d\n\nThe assistance offered by the National and State Disaster Response Funds (NDRF and SDRF) could be optimised for improved efficiency and faster disbursal. \u201cCertain regulations, such as the 25% cap on SDRF allocations for relief operations and some procedural requirements, may create hurdles in utilising these funds in a timely manner. By simplifying these processes, there may be an opportunity to enhance the overall impact of disaster relief initiatives,\u201d Mr. Parthasarathy said.\n\nThe study emphasises the need for proactive disaster risk financing mechanisms such as resilience bonds, disaster insurance, and catastrophe bonds.\n\nResilience bonds encourage investments in disaster prevention projects and offer incentives for reducing the effects of disasters. Disaster insurance supports individuals, companies, or governments in recovering from losses brought on by natural disasters. Catastrophe bonds allow governments or organisations to shift disaster risk to investors who receive interest unless a disaster occurs. \u201cThese provide quick funds during emergencies and reduce the need to take external loans after disasters,\u201d Ms. Nandini said.\n\nOpinion | The lapses in the disaster management Bill\n\nHowever, implementing such measures in India is challenging due to a lack of awareness and understanding among stakeholders, including governments and the public, about the benefits of such instruments, she added. The other key challenges include the high cost of disaster insurance premiums and a lack of a clear financial and legal framework for issuing resilience bonds or incorporating them into state budgets.\n\nPublic-private partnerships are also essential for building a climate-resilient economy. Governments can offer tax incentives for businesses to invest in climate resilience infrastructure and enforce sustainability regulations.\n\nDiverting funds from other projects is a usual way for governments to handle disasters while staying within budget. However, it is difficult to move money from fixed expenses like debt payments, salaries, or pensions as these take up most of the budget and are already set by law. Governments need flexible budgets, backup plans, and quick ways to adjust spending based on what is required so that they can quickly reallocate funds during emergencies.\n\nOpinion | India\u2019s disaster management story as a work in progress\n\n\u201cThe states need to invest in early warning systems, cyclone shelters, and resilient infrastructure and promote sustainable land use that can minimise the economic impact of climate change and lower the long-term costs of dealing with disasters. Many states have already made progress: Tamil Nadu has installed advanced cyclone monitoring systems, Kerala has adopted climate-adaptive urban planning, and Odisha and many others have introduced budget tracking for climate-related spending,\u201d Ms. Nandini said.\n\nWith climate change driving an increase in the frequency and intensity of disasters, the researchers warned that Indian states will face even greater financial challenges in the future. However, by adopting the recommended measures, they believe India can mitigate long-term financial risks, protect lives and infrastructure, and work toward building a stronger, more sustainable future."

            "article_content": "Getty Image\n\nA wild, rather star-studded sports-related antitrust trial is currently taking place in a Brooklyn federal court. The case being litigated is the defunct second version of the North American Soccer League (NASL) versus the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) and Major League Soccer (MLS).\n\nThe North American Soccer League, led by its former chairman Rocco Commisso, the billionaire founder, CEO, and owner of cable company Mediacom, is seeking up to $170 million in damages from USSF and MLS. The amount would be tripled if NASL gets a favorable verdict, as is the case in all antitrust lawsuits.\n\nWhen the trial first began earlier this month, among those who were expected to testify were MLS commissioner Don Garber, FC Dallas and Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, Big East commissioner Val Ackerman (a former USSF board member), and former NBA star Carmelo Anthony, who owned the NASL Puerto Rico FC franchise.\n\nCommisso, who owned the NASL New York Cosmos franchise and still owns ACF Fiorentina, and NASL attorney Jeff Kessler claim that MLS and USSF conspired to stop NASL from competing with MLS and then conspired to remove the soccer league\u2019s Division II status, leading to it folding in 2018.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the trial so far, occurred this week when Kessler, who is also representing Michael Jordan in his race team\u2019s lawsuit against NASCAR, asked Commisso about a Twitter account that used to make derogatory statements about the USSF and MLS.\n\nCommisso, who previously admitted during the lawsuit\u2019s discovery phase that he ran the account anonymously, said he created the account so his posts wouldn\u2019t interfere with his media company\u2019s business. He also admitted creating a second anonymous Twitter account, and, Front Office Sports reports, ordered a public relations executive at Mediacom to post negative things about MLS and USSF on that account.\n\nAmong the tweets Rocco Commisso wrote on Twitter using the anonymous \u201cGlobal Soccer Fan\u201d account was one in which he wrote, \u201cUSSF has been raped by the Harvey Weinstein of US Soccer \u2013 Garber, who with MLS owners and Gulati, have engineered a Madoff-type scam on all of American soccer.\u201d\n\nCommisso was referring to MLS commissioner Don Garber, USSF president Sunil Gulati, convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein and Bernie Madoff, mastermind of the largest known Ponzi scheme in history.\n\nWhen asked by Ruskin, \u201cYou chose to equate someone with rape over a business grievance where you didn\u2019t get what you wanted, correct? That\u2019s when you decided to do this, yes or no?\u201d Commisso replied \u201cYes\u201d to both questions."

            "article_content": "Never before had cleaning off so shaped history. But when an Egyptian princess went to take a quick dip in the Nile, her discovery and rescue of baby Moses in his basket set the Israelites on their path toward that eventual dramatic escape from the shackles of Egypt.\n\nThe second chapter of Exodus sets the scene: \u201cThe daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her attendants walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid (amatah) to bring it. When she opened it, she saw the child. He was crying, and she took pity on him. \u2018This must be one of the Hebrews\u2019 children,\u2019 she said.\u201d\n\nMiriam, Moses\u2019 sister, having held out hope at the riverbank that somehow her brother might sail past the clutches of Pharaoh\u2019s decree that all male Jewish children be slaughtered, saw what unfolded and helpfully offered to find a nursemaid to suckle the child. That volunteer caretaker she recommended, of course, was secretly Moses\u2019 biological mother, Yocheved. Moses then grew up in the palace of the king but with the spiritual and national mentorship of his Jewish family, uniquely positioning him to lead his people to freedom.\n\nThe act of warm-heartedness of this unnamed Egyptian was, ever since, celebrated by the Jewish tradition.\n\nMoses\u2019s rescue-by-princess was depicted on the western wall of the ruins of the ancient synagogue ruins found in Dura-Europos, modern-day Syria, in a rendering dated to the mid-third century C.E. In it, Pharaoh is off to the side, seated on his throne. A scribe next to him writes down the royal commands \u2014 no doubt the order to execute babies, the very edict his own daughter disobeys.\n\nRabbinic texts also parsed every aspect of the brief episode. Why did she need to go bathe, they wondered? Sefer HaYashar suggests a sunburn. God had sent a heatwave, which seared the Egyptians and left them seeking a means of cooling off. Perhaps, came another conjecture, she had that awful skin disease, tzara\u2019at. Thus Shemot Rabbah\u2019s proposal that \u201cPharaoh\u2019s daughter was a leper; that is why she went to bathe. When she touched the basket she was cured. That is why she had compassion for Moses and loved him exceedingly.\u201d\n\nPirkei deRebbe Eliezer adds that her sensitive skin required the cold Nile water, as opposed to the warm water of an indoor facility. Her subsequent reward, though unspecified in the Bible itself, was eternal bliss \u2013 \u201cWhosoever preserves a life is as though he had kept alive the whole world. Therefore was she worthy to (inherit) the life in this world and the life in the world to come.\u201d Mystical texts record her entering the heavenly realm alive, sitting alongside Elijah and the Messiah.\n\nThe Talmud, in turn, senses a sign of her personal fealty to the Jewish cause as an aspiring convert to the faith. \u201cRabbi Yohanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai: This teaches that she came down to the river to cleanse herself from the impurity of her father\u2019s idols, as she was immersing herself as part of the conversion process.\u201d\n\nNo doubt miracles enabled the shocking rescue. She felt compelled to head to the site because of a dream, offered the first-century work Biblical Antiquities. Other texts add that the princess saw the Divine Presence hovering above Moses. When her maidens tried to convince her not to save him, the angel Gabriel came from heaven and struck them down. Though perhaps it wasn\u2019t a maiden she sent to grab the basket, but rather her arm stretched many cubits (amot) to enable her to grab it.\n\nAnother Talmudic tractate gives the anonymous-in-the-Bible heroine a name reflecting her loyalty to Israel\u2019s God. Actually, two names. She was called Bityah (\u201cGod\u2019s daughter) or Yehudiyah (\u201cJewess\u201d).\n\nWas she even Pharaoh\u2019s biological daughter? A surprising Midrash Talpiot argued that she was not. Rather, she and Moses\u2019 future wife Tziporah were Moses\u2019 biological sisters (!). The former was seized by force by the Egyptian king, and the latter by Jethro, Pharaoh\u2019s adviser and Moses\u2019 eventual father-in-law, and raised in their respective homes. (Lest one be shocked that Moses, according to this text, eventually married his sister, the midrash notes that this was permissible prior to Sinai, and Tziporah was uniquely righteous.)\n\nOf course, suggests the Arukh HaShulchan, Pharaoh\u2019s daughter was spared the death of the firstborn \u2014 the 10th of those notorious Plagues \u2014 in the merit of Moshe, whose life she had saved.\n\nMoses undoubtedly expressed gratitude for the rescue. As the scholar of the Second Temple period Malka Simkovich has noted, Ezekiel the Tragedian, a second- or first-century B.C.E. Jew who lived in Egypt, composed a Greek play whose verses have Moses reminiscing how: \u201cThroughout my boyhood years the princess did, for princely rearing and instruction apt, provide all things, as though I were her own, the circle of the days then being full.\u201d\n\nSimkovich also notes that the second century BCE Book of Jubilees calls Bityah a different name, Thermuthis, as does the historian Josephus. A popular Greek name for Egyptian women at the time, it\u2019s a variation of the Egyptian Renen\u016btet, the Egyptian goddess of nourishment, from the verb meaning \u201cto nurse or rear,\u201d a fitting appellation for the adoptive figure.\n\nIn Josephus\u2019 dramatic detailing, after the extraordinary rescue, she hoped Moses would himself become king: \u201c\u2026 one day she brought Moses to her father and showed him to him, and told him how she had been mindful for the succession, were it God\u2019s will to grant her no child of her own, by bringing up a boy of divine beauty and generous spirit, and by what a miracle she had received him of the river\u2019s bounty, \u2018and I thought,\u2019 she said, \u2018to make him my child and heir to your kingdom.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlas, in playing with his adopted grandson, Pharaoh freaks out. \u201cTo please his daughter, [he] placed his diadem upon [Moses\u2019] head. But Moses tore it off and flung it to the ground, in mere childishness, and trampled it underfoot; and this was taken as an omen of evil import to the kingdom.\u201d\n\nWhen the adult Moses led his people to liberation, Bityah joined her now-fellow Jews and went too. In her old age, she married Caleb, who, alongside Joshua, encouraged the desert-wandering Israelite tribes to ignore the bad report of the spies who had returned from scouting the Promised Land. As the Talmud tells it, \u201cThe Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let Caleb, who rebelled against the advice of the spies, come and marry the daughter of Pharaoh, who rebelled against the idols of her father\u2019s home.\u201d\n\nModern literary scholars have suggested the princess\u2019 salvation foreshadows God\u2019s own extension of His saving hands to His people. Pharaoh\u2019s daughter\u2019s coming down and seeing a baby crying is mirrored by God\u2019s actions in Exodus\u2019 third chapter, which has Him telling the now adult Moses \u201cI have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out \u2026 So I have come down to rescue them.\u201d\n\nThe bath of Bityah (or Yehudiyah or Thermuthis) then, even without the rabbinic accounts of the many miracles involved in her saving of Moses and subsequent religious conversion, offers a model for those non-palace-dwellers of us to follow. If her dunk to cool off on that hot Egyptian afternoon teaches us anything, it\u2019s that small acts of kindness to the other might very well draw forth God\u2019s salvation for us all.\n\nRabbi Dr. Stuart Halpern is Senior Adviser to the Provost of Yeshiva University and Deputy Director of Y.U.\u2019s Straus Center for Torah and Western Thought.

            "article_content": "During World War II, American submarines in the Pacific proved effective at slipping past enemy patrols, mounting surprise attacks on vulnerable targets and dodging retaliation, flexing the power of their stealth as they destroyed supply lines and naval fleets of the Imperial Japanese Navy. As submarine detection technology evolved over the last century, introducing passive and active sonar, surface-scanning radar, and magnetic anomaly detectors, submarines only got stealthier.\n\nYet one practical issue is stymying America\u2019s progress toward the ultimate undersea stealth platform: submarines must creep near the surface every few weeks to reorientate themselves and maintain accurate navigation.\n\nBecause the radio waves emitted from GPS satellites cannot penetrate water, subs rely on a method called inertial navigation (also known as \u201cdead-reckoning\u201d) to determine their position, orientation, and velocity. But due to a phenomenon known as integration drift, these systems gradually lose accuracy over time; small errors in measuring angular velocity and acceleration compound until they become massive errors. So, every few weeks, submarines must expose themselves at the surface to allow a retractable satellite antenna to retrieve GPS data, effectively course-correcting the ship.\n\nHowever, this indiscretion time near the surface not only breaks a submarine\u2019s stealth, but may prove pointless in the end, should an enemy destroy or jam satellite navigation signals. As such, the U.S. Navy has been scrambling toward a quantum physics-based solution that could not only help submarines sense where they are without having to risk exposure near the surface, but also elevate their tactical advantage in anti-submarine warfare and intelligence-gathering. If implemented, this technology could buttress the operation of sensors and navigation systems, extend detection range, and greatly enhance computing power.\n\nBut the real trick will be putting quantum sensors onto subs before China does. Otherwise China could beat the U.S. in developing spy technology that can see our subs long before we see them.\n\nTypically, submarines leverage several methods to remain concealed: the massive volume of ocean water, acoustic silence, and measures to reduce their electromagnetic signature\u2014the distortions created by the metal of the vessel\u2019s hull.\n\nBut if quantum technology becomes the standard, these methods will no longer be enough.\n\nCurrently, detecting submerged submarines with sonar or electromagnetic sensors requires relative physical proximity\u2014but two odd properties of quantum physics could greatly increase detection range.\n\nOne of them is quantum entanglement. This refers to the odd phenomenon by which one particle\u2019s behavior can be closely related, or \u201centangled,\u201d with another, potentially distant particle. That makes it possible for some quantum sensors that read nearby particles to also provide information on the activity of a faraway particle.\n\nSecondly, quantum superposition\u2014the ability to maintain more than one state simultaneously\u2014would potentially facilitate an exponential increase in computing power for onboard instruments that receive sensor data. Today\u2019s quantum computers already do this, storing data not only like a classical computer that works in binary (either 0 or 1), but in qubits, which consider additional possibilities such as both 0 and 1 simultaneously.\n\nCurrently, detection instruments called gravimeters and magnetometers enable detection of the submarines several hundred feet away. However, they can be adapted, using quantum technology, to detect subs from several miles away.\n\nQuantum gravimeters are already used in multiple fields, including for the study of volcanoes and melting ice sheets. They detect miniscule gravitational fields by sensing how they \u201cpull\u201d free-falling atoms that have been laser-cooled and super-positioned into multiple states simultaneously. Adapted for a submarine, a quantum -equipped magnetometer could be used to read the subtle variations of the Earth\u2019s magnetic fields like a map. Because it accurately determines position, it would obviate a submarine\u2019s need for indiscretion time near the surface.\n\nQuantum sensors might also give submarines a new tool to quietly detect enemies without resorting to noisy active sonar. And, such sensors would provide the means to receive more detailed communication signals while more deeply submerged. A quantum gravimeter could also be used to more accurately detect and analyze enemy transmissions, since the quantum tech could simultaneously survey a broader bandwidth than is possible using traditional systems.\n\nFurthermore, quantum navigation might\u2014if sufficiently miniaturized\u2014also enable long-range weapons to precisely strike a target over huge distances, even when denied satellite navigation access.\n\nToday, submarine-hunting aircraft use conventional magnetometers that are mostly effective just above half a mile. However, engineers have come up with a type of magnetometer called a SQUID (for Superconducting Quantum Interference Device), which has the potential to boost detection range to 3.7 miles\u2014hypothetically covering over a hundred times more surface area. SQUID technology for submarine detection could eventually become lighter, smaller, and more practical, and offer orders-of-magnitude higher resolution than conventional magnetometers.\n\nLastly, quantum technology\u2019s potential to massively increase computing power could one day enable autonomous submarine combat missions\u2014without the need for a crew. The first relatively large, fully autonomous XLUUV-class drone submarines are entering U.S. military service to perform specialized missions. But more powerful AI with quantum computing might enable XLUUVs to perform a wider range of combat missions at a fraction of the cost and size of manned submarines.\n\nQuantum detection sensors could give vessels plying the surface of the water an advantage, too. Installing such sensors on patrolling aircraft carriers or transport ships could make it very dangerous for submarines to infiltrate close to key targets.\n\nWhen it comes to spearheading the naval arms race towards quantum sensor integration, China appears to be winning. However, the U.S. and its allies in the Pacific and Europe are also making major investments in quantum technologies for naval warfare, with France being first to adopt quantum gravimeters for operational use in 2024.\n\nTo date, the nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational Information Technology and Innovation Foundation estimates that China\u2019s government has spent over $15 billion on quantum research\u2014though the figure is debated, as Beijing\u2019s budgeting is notoriously opaque. The U.S. has reportedly spent $3.8 billion.\n\nThough Congress has passed resolutions calling on the Pentagon to close the gap with China, U.S. defense spending on quantum systems remains tentative, due to the immaturity of many existing quantum technologies.\n\nSetting aside long-term developments, quantum technologies seem poised to render submarines more vulnerable to detection in the mid-term. But it\u2019s far too early to tell whether quantum technology will give submarine hunters an enduring edge, or be just another temporary leg up in a continually evolving technological arms race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
