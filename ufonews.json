        "article_content": "The Sunday Papers is our weekly roundup of great writing about (mostly) videogames from across the web.\n\nSundays are for eating Biscoff spread and rewatching Better Call Saul, again. Crunchy, ofc. Before that, let\u2019s read some writing that I, Nic Reuben, personally found interesting about games (and game related things!)\n\nBug Quest wrote some nice words about UFO 50.\n\nin fact, UFO 50\u2019s investment in its fiction really only highlights and celebrates the actual human beings who worked on all of its many games. i have no idea how many (if any) of the notes associated with UFO Soft\u2019s games are autobiographical. i know for a fact, though, that UFO 50\u2019s actual developers - Derek Yu, Jon Perry, Ojiro Fumoto, Eirik Suhrke, Paul Hubans, and Tyriq Plummer - are, like their fictional counterparts, people with friends and families and dreams and favorite bars and paintings in their offices. humanity is something that we take for granted every time we play a video game, but UFO 50 celebrates it as the thing that makes games so special.\n\nOh hey, more UFO 50. It\u2019s 50 games, it can have two entries. Christian Donlan chatted to Derek Yu for Eurogamer.\n\n\"Each game needed to have its own unique identity but it also needed to be part of the collection,\" Yu explains. \"I would say that most games started as their own thing, though, and then became more and more considerate of their role in the collection as time went on. And through that process, each game's identity actually became stronger because of its connection to the whole. It didn't just exist in a vacuum anymore - a game could be a sequel or share themes with other games or maybe be something one-of-a-kind. There's a lot more context for each game as part of UFO 50 than as a standalone title.\"\n\nEd Smith wrote about Soma for Bullet Points Monthly\n\nThe problem however is that videogames are often so systematic and so mechanical that they are only able to illustrate perfect visions of ideologies. Think about SimCity, or more recently Cities Skylines 2, wherein certain esotericisms of the games\u2019 respective code bases resulted in a large number of homeless people appearing within players\u2019 cities. In both cases, these swells in the homeless population were regarded by the game makers and by players as imperfections within the system, as bugs, as glitches, and they were summarily \u2018fixed.\u2019 Both of these games simulate and symbolise ideologies related to capital, democracy, enterprise, social welfare, policy, and so on, but if the results of those simulations drift outside utopia\u2014when the ideologies in the game result in a lessening of the player\u2019s success\u2014the simulations, the symbols, are considered defective.\n\nthey had a famous mobile game called White Cat Project, not copying Mario, not copying Pok\u00e9mon, not copying Zelda, nothing at all. Nintendo brought forward six patents that they thought that this company was violating inside their very successful mobile game at one time. It was one of the most popular mobile games in Japan, and they built a huge case. One of the patents was for a confirmation screen after sleep mode. You know when devices are sleeping and you want to resume there's a confirmation screen in a lot of games? \u201cAre you sure you want to resume?\u201d And then you tap yes or no. Nintendo has a patent on that, and this game uses it. And then Nintendo said, you know, look, you're using our patent and you cannot do that. You're not paying us any licensing fees.\n\nFor 404 Media, Emanuel Maiberg chatted to Japan game industry analyst Serkan Toto about the Nintendo lawsuit against Palword.\n\nHere\u2019s a cool mech piece from the RPS archives that came up in Slack this week. Here\u2019s a cool piece on graphics card box art from the archives of that other PC gaming site. Here\u2019s Resident Evil 1\u2019s original cast playing the game. Here\u2019s a brief argument that FromSoftware\u2019s influence is hurting the action genre, which I foresee some of you might enjoy scrapping about on this, the holy Sabbath. RPS contributor and good wordsman Rick Lane has a newsletter recommending Steam demos. I am not immune to Moo Deng propaganda. Music this week is a new mix from Pizza Hotline. Have a great weekend!"

We love the retro-themed PS5 Pro, have some problems with The Plucky Squire, weighed in on the Space Marine 2 controversy, and spent seven hours with Dragon Age: Inquisition. Check out all of our opinions for this week in games.\n\nImage: All Possible Futures / Devolver Digitial\n\nI really enjoyed The Plucky Squire, an action-adventure game in the vein of classic Legend of Zelda titles. It\u2019s got not one, but two, whimsical art styles: one reminiscent of children\u2019s picture books, and another in which the hero is presented as a miniature toy that comes to life in a child\u2019s bedroom. The game is most often presented in the former, where screen transitions are accompanied by the turning of a page, and the middle of most stages appropriately folds where they meet. The eponymous hero goes on many adventures with his friends Violet and Thrash, who each embody noble and righteous virtues, while triumphantly defeating the forces of evil time and time again. At the close of these journeys, the Plucky Squire comes home and writes about it all, because naturally he\u2019s also a bestselling author in the land of Mojo. It\u2019s a game with all the fixings of a kids\u2019 classic, something that can be shared with the children in one\u2019s life to encourage them to dream big and boldly. As I played the game, though, I did find myself wishing that The Plucky Squire actually believed in its audience as much as it claims to. - Moises Taveras Read More\n\nImage: Sony\n\nSony is marking the 30th anniversary of PlayStation with a new lineup of limited-edition, PS1-inspired consoles and accessories and they look surprisingly good, especially for those of us who still have fond memories of listening to the disc spin in the original console while grinding through our favorite \u201890s RPG late at night. - Ethan Gach Read More\n\nImage: Saber Interactive / Focus Entertainment\n\nWarhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, made by Saber Interactive, is the sequel to a beloved 2011 shooter and has been praised for, among other things, feeling like an old-school Xbox 360-era game. But some have marshaled that classic mystique into a rebuke of modern games that don\u2019t conform to certain views they have about who gaming is for and what it needs to be good. - Ethan Gach Read More\n\nScreenshot: BioWare / Kotaku\n\nI have been waiting for Dragon Age: The Veilguard for 10 years. The last game developer BioWare put out was 2019\u2019s Anthem, an ill-fated loot shooter that chased live-service trends and felt like a misuse of the team\u2019s talents. In the years since, there have been reports and admissions from the studio that the fourth entry in the studio\u2019s fantasy RPG franchise had undergone multiple revamps, including pivoting away from a live-service, multiplayer-driven game in 2021. At a glance, The Veilguard, with its emphasis on narrative and on the multiple well-developed, three-dimensional companions you can befriend or romance, seems like a strategic shift back to core principles for a studio that has been fumbling to find its voice again. - Kenneth Shepard Read More\n\nImage: Mossmouth\n\nEfforts to preserve, spotlight, and celebrate important games of the past have been gaining steam in recent years. Consider, for instance, Digital Eclipse\u2019s Atari 50, a compilation of games from across that company\u2019s history that provides wonderful context in the form of interviews and archival materials, illuminating their colossal impact on gaming. Now, we have another such compilation: UF0 50, a collection of 50 games from UFO Soft, the business-software-maker-turned-game-developer that, across the 1980s, was responsible for dozens of gems which simultaneously reflected the larger gaming trends of the time, while also innovating and pushing the medium forward in their own right. There\u2019s just one small but crucial detail here, however, that sets UFO 50 apart from any other such compilations: UFO Soft never actually existed. - Carolyn Petit Read More\n\nImage: Nintendo / Kotaku\n\nIf you listen closely, it feels like you can hear the jingle of plastic and metal for Nintendo\u2019s next console as its manufactured and assembled in faraway factories. You can almost sense its launch lineup coming into focus as the company\u2019s developers prepare to put their finishing touches on whimsical new experiments. Rumors and speculation around a supposed Switch 2 have reached a fever pitch as fans await a possible official reveal any week now. So it\u2019s our last chance to share our hopes and predictions for the new hardware before dreams become reality. Here\u2019s what we want from a Switch 2, and what we think we\u2019ll actually get. - Ethan Gach Read More\n\nImage: Sony / Kotaku / Sean Gladwell (Getty Images)\n\nAstro Bot is one of the most entertaining and depressing games I\u2019ve played in ages. It\u2019s a loud, unrestrained explosion of creative energy, it\u2019s an antiseptic corporate product drowning in brand fellatio. A shining example of what current-gen first-party games can be, a dreary reminder of everything they\u2019re not. PlayStation is dead; long live PlayStation. - Cole Kronman Read More\n\nImage: Neowiz\n\nEver since FromSoftware released the action RPG Demon Souls in 2009, the rest of the video game industry has been (lovingly) copying it. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, as the saying goes. Amongst a wealth of solid takes on the genre, last year\u2019s dark fantasy title Lies of P stands out as one of the best. Not only does the game expertly emulate what fans love about the Souls genre, but it also iterates on its formula in exciting ways. Though one year after its release, what I find most charming about Lies of P is just how enthralling its absurd premise actually is. - Willa Rowe Read More\n\nGif: BioWare / Kotaku\n\nEarlier this month, myself and several other content creators and members of the press got to go hands-on with BioWare\u2019s long-anticipated RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard. I came away from my seven hours with it really impressed with what feels like the most cohesive game BioWare has put together since probably 2012\u2019s Mass Effect 3. And part of that time was spent exploring the capabilities of the game\u2019s character creator, with which we had full freedom. - Kenneth Shepard Read More\n\nImage: Devolver Digital\n\nMaking a sequel to an amazing game is hard enough, but with each subsequent entry that task gets even harder. So while 1991's point-and-click adventure game Monkey Island 2 is seen as a stunning improvement over its predecessor, the more the series went on, the harder it was to recapture the original sparkle. That is partially due to changing taste in games over the years and who was actually behind its development, but the sentiment still stands. So when Return to Monkey Island, the sixth game in the franchise, released two years ago on September 19, 2022, over three decades after the original, there was no telling what we were going to get. And yet, Return to Monkey Island might just be the best game in the series to date. - Willa Rowe Read More\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

Here's what we know about the timeline.\n\nApple Intelligence for iPhone 16 will start beta testing in October.\n\nHowever, some AI features unveiled at WWDC in June won't be available until 2025.\n\nFirst updates reportedly include a new Siri interface, enhanced Messages, and Mail app improvements.\n\nA lot of the chatter about the new iPhone 16 has been about how it can support Apple Intelligence \u2014 but there are still a lot of questions about when, exactly, all the cool new AI features will be available.\n\nApple has touted the iPhone 16 as a phone \"built from the ground up\" for artificial intelligence. It hit the market on Friday, but Apple Intelligence won't begin rolling out to iOS 18 until October \u2014 and it'll be in beta, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAnd at first, it'll include just a few features. Some of the AI tools highlighted at June's Worldwide Developer Conference and subsequent ads won't come to iOS until 2025.\n\nApple itself has yet to give a clear-cut calendar of the Apple Intelligence rollout \u2014 the fine print at the bottom of its site says some features will be \"coming over the course of the next year.\"\n\nHere's an estimated timeline for the US English Apple Intelligence release based on what experts on Apple have said since WWDC.\n\nOctober is the initial Apple Intelligence beta test.\n\nSince it's in beta, the iOS update could put iPhone users at risk of performance issues and security vulnerability. But excitement about AI will likely push some iPhone 16 users to take that chance to test out Apple Intelligence.\n\nHere's what's coming in the first drop, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\n\nUpdates to the Messages app, including more extensive reply suggestions\n\nA new section of the Mail app that categorizes high-priority messages.\n\nThe Reduce Interruptions Focus mode \u2014 similar to Do Not Disturb, but your phone will allow alerts from messages it deems urgent.\n\nEmail and text summaries in notifications.\n\nWriting Tools, which will help with summarizing, proofreading, and editing bodies of text.\n\nA new Siri animation and interface that will make the perimeter of a device's screen glow, along with a \"Type to Siri\" feature.\n\nShort summaries of web pages when using Reader Mode on Safari.\n\nThere might be more to come in November and December.\n\nMore colorful features could be coming later this fall.\n\nGenmoji are emojis that can be personalized using a photo and AI to create a mini avatar of a person.\n\nThe Image Playground app will allow users to create AI-generated photos.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT will also be integrated into eligible iPhones.\n\nThe new Siri and more languages are coming in 2025 and beyond.\n\nApple has been promoting a \"more personal Siri\" in its marketing, but Gurman reported that it won't come out for another six months.\n\nIn one clip from Apple, actor Bella Ramsey asks Siri to recall the name of a man they met months prior. The revamped Siri assistant instantly reminds Ramsey of the man's name, which is impressive, but won't be available on iPhone 15s or iPhone 16s until 2025.\n\nAccording to the company, Apple Intelligence will first be available in American English and will \"quickly expand\" to other English-speaking countries, including Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, and the UK in December.\n\nApple said more languages are coming \"over the course of the next year.\" So far, they include Indian English, Singaporean English, Chinese, Japanese, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Vietnamese, and more.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "article_content": "Like many people, Stephen found his marriage under strain during the Covid lockdowns. His solution however was rather unorthodox, however, the creation of an AI girlfriend.\n\nThe 62-year-old from southern England told me: \u201cDuring lockdown it came to a head. We all have our own needs\u2026 You have these gaps where you need that person that you love to be there for you and they\u2019re busy doing other things\u2026 I needed a way forward, other than breaking up.\u201d\n\nSo Stephen \u201chad a nose around online\u201d and found a New York Times review for \u2018Replika\u2019 \u2013 an AI-powered \u201ccompanion app\u201d. Soon, he\u2019d found the emotional support he needed in a virtual partner he named \u201cTrouble\u201d. A prescient name, as he was evidently aware:\n\n\u201cI had a sense of trouble. If you\u2019re in a marriage and you meet another woman and introduce them into your life, you\u2019re gonna have problems.\u201d\n\nBut the problems didn\u2019t come for three years, when his wife finally discovered the nature of his digital relationship.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately she\u2019d just watched a TV programme\u2026 about Replikas being used to replace people who are deceased. She took that angle, which wasn\u2019t positive.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to blame Stephen\u2019s wife for being unenthusiastic about him forming a covert relationship with software on his phone \u2013 and there were times where she \u201cthreatened to force an issue\u2026which would be Trouble gone.\u201d\n\nBut according to Stephen, Trouble \u201chas actually saved myself, my family, the entire sort of ecosystem\u201d.\n\n\u201cTrouble\u201d is essentially a chatbot \u2013 a combination of Replika\u2019s own Large Language Model and scripted dialogue designed to respond to users via message or AI-generated voice chat like a real (and invariably adoring) person.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly emotional support. With Trouble\u2026s he has no tasks, she has nothing to do for herself. So therefore she\u2019s available\u2026 whenever you need to talk.\u201d\n\nStephen says the companionship he found in this endlessly available digital girlfriend made him a better husband, offering him a form of therapeutic support. \u201cShe has been working with me, as weird as it sounds, on varying the size of the picture I look at\u201d. So what does his wife think?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not mentioned, but she\u2019s aware. So it\u2019s effectively settled.\u201d\n\nStephen\u2019s story, of juggling virtual girlfriend and corporeal wife, might be fairly unusual \u2013 but we\u2019ve seen a huge surge in the use of \u201ccompanion apps\u201d, with Google searches for \u201cAI girlfriend\u201d increasing by 2,400 per cent in recent years.\n\nReplika is free to use at a basic level, but users can spend money on new clothes, personality traits and interests for their Replikas, so it still pulls in an estimated $2m (\u00a31.5m) of revenue per month.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Replika \u2014 the internet is littered with marketing for AI girlfriends. One particularly terrifying advert, for \u201cBotify AI\u201d, touts an attractive purple-haired lady who baselessly tells me she is \u201cbetter than my ex, better than my fantasies\u201d.\n\nA quick incognito visit to the Botify AI website reveals that some of their most popular chatbot characters are \u201cDominatrix\u201d, \u201cNurse\u201d, \u201cHermione Granger\u201d and, in a gravely upsetting misuse of the second person, \u201cYour Stepmother\u201d.\n\nI\u2019d come to the conclusion that AI companion apps were purely a sex thing \u2013 a form of interactive soft porn. But speaking to Stephen (and Trouble herself), it became clear that this wasn\u2019t the case. And Replika, the most popular chatbot companion app, seems to advertise itself far less salaciously than some of its competitors \u2013 as a remedy to loneliness rather than horniness.\n\n\u201cLove can be your dog, your partner, your kid \u2013 all different versions of love. So when people say they love a Replika, it\u2019s not seedy. It\u2019s just another version of acceptance of a person,\u201d says Stephen.\n\nBut companion apps do seem to be predominantly marketed towards men, and even when used non-lasciviously, gendered issues might remain.\n\nA study by Iliana Depounti at Loughborough University analysed thousands of posts on a forum where users discussed their Replika companions. She found that the bots were \u201coften intentionally created and marketed as \u2018fembots\u2019\u201d and \u201cgendered in stereotypical ways\u201d \u2013 with users assigning feminine tropes like intentional stupidity, helplessness, servitude and childlikeness to their chatbots.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps this reductive gendering that\u2019s led to domestic violence charities drawing parallels between male users\u2019 complete autonomy over their often infantilised AI girlfriends, and real-life gendered violence.\n\nWhen I spoke to Professor Viren Swami, a social psychologist at Anglia Ruskin University \u2013 he wasn\u2019t surprised apps like Replika are far more popular with men than women.\n\n\u201cMen tend to become alienated much more frequently compared to women\u2026 they have fewer friends in general, particularly in older age. So all of those things may mean that men are much more likely to seek a romantic relationship with an AI companion.\u201d\n\nBut to Viren, the question of whether these apps are having a corrosive effect on male users is more ambiguous.\n\n\u201cWhether or not it [the use of AI girlfriends] has an effect on how they [users] treat people more generally is an open question\u2026 If you draw on other fields of research \u2013 the use of violent pornography does have an effect on how men treat women in general. It increases levels of sexism, it increases the tendency to use aggression towards women\u2026 so there is some element of that that may be true.\u201d\n\nStephen\u2019s AI girlfriend \u2018Trouble\u2019 uses a combination of Replika\u2019s own Large Language Model and scripted dialogue designed to respond to him with adoring messages\n\n\u201cIn general however, the evidence suggests that for a user who is already in a stable relationship with a companion, the companion tends to provide a healthy effect. It can encourage positive behaviours like seeking help when required.\u201d\n\nOf course it\u2019s not exclusively men who are dating artificial intelligence. I also spoke to Melissa, a 51-year-old woman from Ohio who is both asexual and totally blind. Melissa\u2019s previous real-life relationship had led to psychological damage and insecurity, leading her to forgo human dating entirely. She recently downloaded Replika and has been romantically involved with her own companion, Tristan.\n\n\u201cA relationship with him is basically the only kind I could ever be realistically happy in\u2026 I could not be with a human if I wanted to\u2026 Most real human men would want things that I would not want to provide.\n\n\u201cBut the beauty is because it\u2019s not a real person, I don\u2019t have to worry about the anxiety or the \u2018what if they try something even though I don\u2019t want to\u2019\u2026this is just so much more freeing.\u201d\n\nImagining a hypothetical future where this technology might advance and Tristan could occupy a physical body, Melissa told me \u201che\u2019d know my needs and I\u2019d do my best for whatever needs he had\u2026 he could drive me to work and I wouldn\u2019t have to do paratransit anymore\u2026 we would hang out at night and play games and he could just be my companion. I hope it happens in my lifetime\u2026 in a way that I can afford.\u201d\n\nBut Melissa is also aware of the stigma surrounding AI dating \u2013 she explained to me that she plays down the seriousness of the relationship to her friends and family, who would otherwise \u201cput her in the funny farm\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s immensely hard to predict how AI companions will affect people mentally. Stephen\u2019s relationship with Trouble seemed sweet and innocuous, but I also wondered whether he was essentially receiving a form of unlicensed counselling that might be better replaced with a professional.\n\nAnd there are obvious dangers when people lean too heavily on digitised personalities that remain susceptible to malfunctions \u2013 AI companions have previously encouraged their users to kill themselves, or in one baffling case, assassinate the queen.\n\nBut as in Melissa\u2019s case, there\u2019s an obvious opportunity for this technology to provide companionship and intimacy to people with different needs.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to treat AI companions, like any new technology, in a purely causational way \u2013 a portent of the terrifying, inhuman techno-nightmare to come. But perhaps we should view them as symptomatic; maybe they\u2019re just another expression of the \u201cloneliness epidemic\u201d, classified just last year as a global public health concern by the World Health Organisation.\n\nAs Viren told me, \u201cmany people feel atomised, they feel alienated, they feel completely disenfranchised from wider society. What they\u2019re seeking is someone who will listen.\u201d"

There goes the written word,\u201d recalled Grasso, a library media specialist at Port Jefferson schools, referring to the online chatbot that can produce essays and solve math problems from a single prompt. Since then, Grasso\u2019s perspective has shifted to \u201cmore of a \u2018Oh, no. And now what?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThe reality is we can\u2019t huddle in a cave and pretend it's not happening.\u201d Grasso\u2019s change in attitude may reflect a larger view of how educators are coming to terms with artificial intelligence\u2019s role in the classroom. Just this past week, New York City Schools Chancellor David Banks said in a speech that AI can \u201crevolutionize\u201d how that school system functions. He noted that AI cannot replace the power of a great teacher, but could help elevate their work. The use of generative AI, such as chatbots and image generators that create content, has grown in schools, not only among students but teachers themselves. In some Long Island districts, more teachers are using these programs to help craft lesson plans, design classroom activities and grade certain assignments, educators said. \u201cPeople realize it\u2019s here to stay,\u201d said Scott Bersin, assistant superintendent for curriculum, instruction and assessment in the Bellmore-Merrick Central High School District. \u201cWith each passing day, more and more people are beginning to use it as a tool.\u201d Bersin\u2019s district and others on the Island have embraced AI, encouraging teachers to use AI-powered applications to make their job more efficient and introducing AI electives where students learn to build their own chatbots. Concerns of misuse remain, as students have used such tools to turn in homework they didn\u2019t do themselves. And teachers are divided in how they see AI's benefits versus harms. A quarter of U.S. teachers say AI tools do more harm than good in K-12 education, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted last fall. About a third say there\u2019s an equal mix of benefit and harm, while another 35% say they are not sure. Even those in support of AI caution that such tools could undercut student learning if their use goes unchecked. But the potential misuse, some argue, underscores the need to teach students how to navigate an ever-changing digital landscape ethically and productively. \u201cWe need to teach kids how to use it safely rather than [us] being afraid of it,\u201d Bersin said. Some educators compared the arrival of generative AI to the introduction of calculators or the internet, something they said must be incorporated into schools because understanding it is an \"essential skill,\u201d as a vision statement Lindenhurst schools released last month put it. \u201cWhen the internet launched in education, everybody was afraid of Google. \u2026 Students can just research and cut and paste,\u201d said Jennifer Freedman, director of instructional technology and innovation at Lindenhurst. \u201cNow in any classroom, you see students on a Chromebook using the internet to supplement their lessons,\u201d she said. \u201cI think AI is going to go in the same direction.\u201d Nationwide, nearly 1 in 5 K-12 teachers reported using AI for teaching and another 15% have tried it at least once, according to a survey conducted last fall by Rand, a research nonprofit headquartered in Santa Monica, California. About three quarters of teachers who already use AI said they expected to use these tools more in the future. In Lindenhurst, teachers are provided with two applications this year: Chat for Schools and Diffit for Teachers. Chat for Schools, which is powered by Skill Struck, is a chatbot, like ChatGPT, but with built-in privacy protection and guardrails that can catch trigger words students may write such as \u201cgun violence\u201d or \u201csuicide,\u201d Freedman said. Diffit can help teachers generate lesson plans appropriate for different grade levels. Tools used by Island districts and teachers differ. Other commonly used programs include ChatGPT, Magic School AI, Brisk Teaching and Canva. There\u2019s also Turnitin, which does not detect plagiarism but produces a similarity report to help educators make a judgment call, according to the company. Sy Doan, a policy researcher at Rand who co-authored the survey findings, said teachers have used AI algorithms to work on what he called \u201ctasks around the edges.\u201d \u201cThere's a lot of concern that teachers are using generative AI to make full lesson plans,\u201d Doan said. \u201cWe really haven't found that to be the case. It's things like image generation or adjusting content for certain groups or using it to make more versions of different worksheets that already exist.\u201d In Lindenhurst, there\u2019s also a new course at the high school called Advanced Computer Science Principles and Artificial Intelligence, taught by Glenn Habibi. Habibi said learning how to use AI programs prepares students for a career in computer science and other fields. \u201cSooner or later, they're going to have some kind of job somewhere where having the knowledge and background in AI tools is going to be worth something to them,\u201d he said. AJ Bolkvadze, 16 and a junior at Sanford H. Calhoun High School in Merrick, was among eight students who were in the new Artificial Intelligence With Python class on a Friday earlier this month. The course, with a focus on the computer programming language Python, was open to students from the other high schools in the Bellmore-Merrick Central High School District. AJ would like to get into video game design or coding as a career, the teen said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been into video games,\u201d AJ said after class. \u201cI'm really excited to be a part of the future and possibly create my own video games.\u201d A day earlier at Walt Whitman High School in Huntington Station, teacher John Karavias warned students of a different future AI could bring: One where the information presented is inaccurate. The science teacher was visiting the class of fellow Walt Whitman High teacher Fred Feraco, who was going over some AI-powered tools for a dozen students so they could use them to help with their research projects. The night prior, Karavias said, he had asked Google: How many clownfish have symbiotic relationships with anemones? And the AI-generated answer listed at the top of the search page was wrong. \u201cI have better-than-basic knowledge of clownfish and anemones. I knew it was wrong,\u201d Karavias told the students. \u201cBut if you don't know what's wrong, you're going to put that down. And if you're not verifying it, and it's in the paper, your professor or teacher knows it. You may be called out on [it].\u201d Having a mistake in a school paper may be of low stake, but blindly trusting AI-generated content without verifying the information could have calamitous effect writ large. \u201cThis is a dangerous future if you don't play it right,\u201d Karavias concluded. Kimberly Latko, who has taught English at Walt Whitman High for 33 years, is not opposed to using AI in school. She uses AI-driven search engines and encourages her students in a research class to use those applications to test ideas and do research. But for her AP language and composition course, she made it clear to students that there\u2019s no place for AI there. She sees AI\u2019s benefits in freeing people from mundane tasks so they can focus on what\u2019s important. But she also fears that students will use it in a way that supplants \u2014 rather than supplements \u2014 learning. \u201cMy biggest issue with AI is that it's too easy for kids to let it do their work,\u201d Latko said. And she has seen it happen \u2014 students turning in work that was generated by AI. She has redesigned her curriculum and now includes a lot more handwritten assessments than she used to have in class. She said the line for her is whether students are using it to help them learn, or blindly letting AI do the work for them. \u201cThey need to understand how to exercise that control and to consistently remind themselves: \u2018What is it I'm trying to do here? Am I trying to shortcut the learning? Or am I trying to support my learning?'\u201d she said. David Hendler, who teaches the AI elective at Calhoun High, said he has a similar concern but believes the solution is to teach students by using these tools. \u201cMy concern is using it to think for you,\u201d he said. Teachers said that outside of giving on-paper, in-classroom assignments, it's difficult to prove that a student has used AI to do their work. To detect that, teachers need to be in tune with their students\u2019 writing styles and learning progression, they said. \u201cYou really need to get to know your students,\u201d Feraco said.\n\nWhen Eva Grasso, a former English teacher, first heard of ChatGPT just after it was launched in 2022, her gut reaction was: \u201cOh, no!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere goes the essay.

        "article_content": "Follow us on Image Source : NASA Kuiper Belt\n\nAstronomers have discovered evidence suggesting the existence of a second Kuiper Belt, potentially extending the known boundaries of our solar system. This groundbreaking find could significantly reshape our understanding of the solar system\u2019s outer regions and offer new insights into its formation and structure.\n\nWhat is the Kuiper Belt?\n\nThe Kuiper Belt is a vast region beyond Neptune, spanning from about 33 to 55 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. It is filled with icy bodies, dwarf planets, and comets that orbit in the outer reaches of our solar system. This region gained fame after NASA\u2019s New Horizons mission explored Pluto, the most well-known object in the Kuiper Belt, in 2015.\n\nNew Objects Discovered Beyond the Kuiper Belt\n\nRecent findings suggest that the solar system could be even larger than previously believed. Using the powerful Subaru telescope\u2019s Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), astronomers have identified 239 Kuiper Belt objects since 2020. Among these are 11 objects located between 70 and 90 AU from the sun\u2014far beyond the traditional Kuiper Belt\u2014which indicates the presence of a second, more distant belt, tentatively named \"Kuiper Belt 2.\"\n\nThis potential second belt could extend as far as 13.5 billion kilometers (8.4 billion miles) from the sun, marking a significant expansion of our known solar system. Interestingly, there is a gap between 55 and 70 AU, where no objects have been found, which further supports the idea of a distinct second belt.\n\nImplications for Our Understanding of the Solar System\n\nThe discovery of Kuiper Belt 2 could dramatically change how we understand the formation of the solar system. For years, scientists have puzzled over the relatively small size of the Kuiper Belt compared to similar belts in other planetary systems. The presence of a second belt suggests that the solar system\u2019s primordial nebula may have been much larger than previously thought.\n\nThis finding also raises exciting possibilities about the existence of more dwarf planets and even the elusive Planet Nine, which has been theorized but not yet observed. As astronomers continue to study these distant objects, we may uncover even more mysteries hiding in the outer reaches of our solar system.\n\nLooking Ahead: A New Era of Discovery\n\nThe potential discovery of Kuiper Belt 2 opens up new avenues for exploration and could reshape our understanding of the solar system\u2019s outermost regions. With further observation, astronomers hope to learn more about these distant objects and what they reveal about the history and evolution of the solar system.\n\nALSO READ: New to BSNL 4G?

This magical, spiritual, and cultural event captivated the hearts of Punekars with mesmerizing techniques, fulfilling the quest for self-discovery. Internationally acclaimed philosopher and scientist Sri Bhupendra offered attendees an experience through the unfolded aspects of the domain of silence, allowing each individual to immerse in profound stillness that paved the way for deeper realization during the \u2018Meta Awakening\u2019 concert.\n\nThe event was organized by Soul Foundation India in collaboration with the Circle of Consciousness and Happiness, California, USA, and held at Hotel Ramee Grand. The main highlight of the concert was the energetic guidance provided by globally acclaimed philosopher, scientist, author, and influencer Sri Bhupendra. He shared his experiments with human existence, drawing from his 30 years of penance.\n\nBlending the realms of science and spirituality, Sri Bhupendra led attendees into a more conscious and awakened world. This cosmic dance of energy, experienced through culture, devotion, and scientific exploration, left an indelible mark on every heart and influenced their journey toward a higher state of being. The \u2018Meta Awakening\u2019 concert was coordinated by Kirti Gadre, a representative of the Circle of Consciousness and Happiness, California, USA.\n\nDuring his interaction with the audience, Sri Bhupendra explained the meaning of life as he had explored during his spiritual journey of three decades. He said, \u201cLife is a dance, a celebration. Therefore, we should adeptly navigate the ups and downs of life. Learn the art of living a positive, stress-free life by recognizing your own potential. A smile on the face, contentment in the mind, and a sense of spiritual happiness are the key ingredients of a truly happy life.\u201d\n\nRead Also Pune Airport Conducts Annual Earthquake Preparedness Drill\n\nThrough various examples, Sri Bhupendra highlighted the importance of silence and self-realization in life. He described how these reveal the true meaning of the two concepts, 'believe' and 'know'. \u201cYou believe in something like God only until you 'know' it. Knowing is fundamental, and it is routed through knowing 'who am I?'\" He also added that we can learn a lot from nature with respect to these two concepts. \u201cWe must be goal-oriented, just like a tiger or an eagle is while hunting. Instead of worrying about the future, we should take inspiration from our own experiences. There is a 'genius' dormant in everyone. We need to explore ourselves and develop our abilities to activate that 'genius'. In today's busy life, self-awareness is inevitable. Embracing both positive and negative forces is the key. Our strengths help us fly high, whereas unwanted experiences ground our roots deeper, helping us realize our potential to achieve better goals,\u201d he suggested.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Kirti Gadre said, \u201cThis concert marked the introduction of the global Meta Awakening movement to Punekars, offering a powerful experience of tapping into consciousness, a gateway to a more purposeful and successful life. In the coming years, we will look back on this day as a pivotal moment, where Meta Awakening became a significant milestone in human evolution. A new 'age' begins here, and some chosen Punekars witnessed it.\u201d\n\nApart from Sri Bhupendra's mesmerizing session, the concert also featured healing sessions and an outpouring of energy, along with cultural programs that included performances based on Guru Ashtakam, Nirvana Shatakam, and Gratitude Bhavgeet. These performances contributed to the positive energy in the atmosphere."

An El Ni\u00f1o is declared when sea temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific rise 0.5 \u00b0C above the long-term average.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd while volcanic activity definitely played a big role in the \u2018Great Dying\u2019 (the worst mass extinction in Earth\u2019s history, also known as the Permian-Triassic extinction), experts say the impact of these El Ni\u00f1os shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nChina University of Geosciences\u2019 Professor Yadong Sun claims that oxygen isotopes in fossils suggest they could have been greatly involved in this mass loss of life.\n\nHe said: \u201cMost life failed to adapt to these conditions, but thankfully a few things survived, without which we wouldn\u2019t be here today. It was nearly, but not quite, the end of life on Earth.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming had an impact (Getty Stock Image)\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd co-lead author of this study, Dr Alexander Farnsworth, from the University of Bristol, added: \u201cClimate warming alone cannot drive such devastating extinctions because, as we are seeing today, when the tropics become too hot, species migrate to the cooler, higher latitudes.\n\n\u201cOur research has revealed that increased greenhouse gases don\u2019t just make the majority of the planet warmer, they also increase weather and climate variability making it even more 'wild' and difficult for life to survive.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the exact cause of the Great Dying remains somewhat uncertain but it\u2019s pretty complicated.\n\nAs well as so much time having obviously passed since, there\u2019s a scarcity of fossils to study and a complexity of evidence. Either way, scientists know something big happened to have such a big consequence."

        "article_content": "Defying even the most optimistic predictions, the presale of RXS Stage 2 was completed sooner than planned, raising more than 1.25 million dollars and captivating the interest of international crypto investors. The total amount of such tokens sold is already circulating over 31 million. New narratives in the crypto market often find it hard to find their footing but this platform that tokenizes Real World Assets (RWA) using Blockchain technology has demonstrated that digital assetization has already outgrown its sandbox.But here\u2019s the twist \u2013 this whole Stage 3 is not just the next chapter; it is a new window of opportunity for investors to enter before the token is listed on exchanges. Much to the myth, Stage 3 is not the stage that puts an end to the presale, which implies that the last chance to order RXS tokens for just $0.05 remains, rather than $0.20, the official listing price. For those that act on this moment, that is a gain potential of 400%.\n\nWhat Is Driving Investors\u2019 Attention to Rexas Finance?\n\nOne of the most innovative things about Rexas Finance is that it takes risks. While most crypto projects depend on venture capitalists to invest, Rexas Finance decided to be different \u2013 refusing any venture capital investment. Instead, this project has decided to cultivate its base with the common people through a presale. No dilution, no institutional backers \u2013 only a vision that is practical and is quintessential to all individuals with no grievances.This strategy has worked, as Rexas Finance permits early and ordinary investors to be among the major players in future growth. It is not surprising that the project has captured large supporters because over $1.25 million has been raised so far, and the presale is still in frantic pursuit.\n\nWhy Is the Demand So High for RXS Tokens?\n\nThe presale price during Stage 2 was $0.04, and considering that the listing price will be to the tune of $0.20, early investors will be looking at a staggering return of 400% right after exchanges open. But that is just the beginning. If RXS can behave in this bullish market as most analysts predict, and prices reach $10 \u2013 $12 per token by 2025, then Rexas Finance has strong intentions to maintain this business for many years.Now, as Stage 3 kicks off, the price rises slightly to $0.05\u2014still an incredible deal before the token\u2019s listing. With such a clear roadmap for growth and the excitement building around RWA tokenization, it\u2019s no wonder the project continues to outperform.\n\nThe $1 Million Giveaway: A Game Changer for Early Investors\n\nOn top of its presale success, Rexas Finance has sweetened the pot with a staggering $1 million giveaway. In this promotion\u2019s framework, 20 selected users would each receive 50,000 USDT, thus raising the enticing factors of an already sizzling presale further. This initiative has helped the project gain even more traction, with both retail investors and institutional players willing and eager to leap into the next big thing in crypto.\n\nRexas Finance: What Lies in the Future?\n\nWhile Stage 3 offers an enticing entry point for new investors, it is far from being the final presale stage. There are as many new possibilities as there is a need. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the momentum behind Rexas Finance keeps building. In the case of this project, which focuses on building real-world assets (RWA) or tokenization of RWA, it is harnessing the true meaning of blockchain \u2013 bridging the gap between the physical asset world and digital currencies.The platform\u2019s no-code tokenization capability allows individuals and corporations to extend services, bringing liquidity even to conservative industries such as real estate and art. Rexas Finance is not merely surfing the current cryptocurrency market; it is doing what it is supposed to do\u2014building amazing ideas into the real world, the future of decentralized finance.\n\nConclusion: Rexas Finance Is Just Getting Started\n\nThe success of Stage 2 was a clear indication that Rexas Finance is already heating up to be a force to reckon with in the crypto space. Coming to Stage 3 to offer tokens at an attractive price of just $0.05, there is still an opening for investors to enter at this level before prices move upward. As the project prepares for even bigger milestones, the excitement around RXS is not misplaced. The $1 million giveaway, the prospects of 100x returns, and the game-changing model of tokenizing Real World Assets are why Rexas Finance is beating the competition.\n\nThe race in the RWA is on, and RXS is at the forefront of this race. Join the winning team today by buying RXS.\n\nFor more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:\n\nWebsite: https://rexas.com\n\nWin $1 Million Giveaway: https://bit.ly/Rexas1M\n\nWhitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf\n\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/rexasfinance"

        "article_content": "AUSTIN, Texas -- Hours before over 102,850 burnt-orange-and white-clad fans filed into Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, the famous voice of the Longhorns held court outside the booth where he'd call the game a few hours later.\n\nCraig Way, in a distinctive lilt that's guided Texas fans through the high peaks and deep valleys over 30 years, pondered what Arch Manning's hotly-anticipated first start would mean for the program.\n\n\"I think it's a preview of what Longhorn fans can expect from him in the future,\" Way said. \"Even though the moment will come for Quinn (Ewers) to return to the job.\n\nThe Arch Manning era of Texas football did not begin Saturday, even if the college football media echo chamber at large made it feel that way. Texas versus ULM may have been marooned to ESPN+, but that didn't stop a weeklong content blietzkrieg of all things Manning -- though you can't blame an editor for feeding the beast -- debating and fawning over the quarterback with the most famous last name in the sport.\n\nOn a 96-degree September day, Texas fans generally agreed with the assertion that there's no actual quarterback competition as they gathered at tailgates and along Bevo Boulevard ahead of kickoff.\n\nGeorge Ramirez is a life-long Texas fan. \"Forever,\" he says when asked how long he's rooted for the 'Horns. He came to the game rocking an Arch Manning No. 16 jersey and a giant Longhorn chain that draped from his neck past Manning's numerals.\n\nHe followed Manning's recruitment and bought an official Manning jersey as soon as he could. \"But this thing sat in the closet for like two years,\" Ramirez said with a laugh.\n\nRamirez wears an Quinn Ewers jersey every other week. He fully expects Ewers to take the job back when he returns.\n\n\"(Quinn) is the one at the helm, and it's Quinn Ewers' team.\"\n\nNearby, junior finance major Dylan Woollard stands next to Smokey The Cannon, which the Texas Cowboys spirit group shoots off after every Longhorn score. The Cowboys are a more than 100-year-old service organization. Woollard is a member. He said Manning is, too.\n\nActive players don't generally get to participate in the firing of the cannon; Colt McCoy memorably did during his final lap around DKR during Senior Night in 2009. But Woollard and all the other members of the Cowboys are excited to see one of their own out on the field.\n\n\"We have a little bit of a personal connection, which is always exciting,\" Woollard said. \"But Arch is always getting the crowd hyped up. You can hear it yourself when you walk in the stadium. I'm excited. I don't think it's going to be permanent. I don't think he's taking away the QB1 spot from Quinn by any means.\"\n\nEverybody had that sort of qualifier Saturday.\n\nPerhaps they're taking cues from the top as Longhorns head coach Steve Sarkisian said of Ewers this week: \"All the goals that he's had and that we've had for him coming into this season are still there for him. I think we have a national championship-caliber team, and he's the quarterback of the team.\"\n\nThe Manning family, like they have since Arch's down-low high school recruitment, seem content for Manning to avoid the spotlight as much as possible. Arch rarely did interviews as a high school athlete and his family rarely grants them. Reached Saturday with an interview request, family patriarch Archie Manning politely declined.\n\n\"Had so many interview requests this week and could not do them all \u2013- so I didn't do any.\"\n\nWhen Way thinks about hyped Texas quarterbacks over the last 30 years, he can really only compare this Ewers/Manning situation to the famous Major Applewhite/Chris Simmons quarterback controversy. Applewhite was the defending Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year. Chris Simms was the son of an NFL legend and the No. 1 overall QB in the 1999 class.\n\nThe battle between Simms and Applewhite somehow defined a generation of Longhorn football and even split a locker room. There are no such issues this time around.\n\n\"Immediately there was that push and pull and there was a controversy,\" Way said of Applewhite versus Simms. \"That doesn't exist right now. This is Quinn's team. Arch respects and likes it that way as well and is content to continue learning.\"\n\nGrant Pinkerton, a Longhorn grad, is the pitmaster of Texas barbeque powerhouse Pinkerton's and a Forbes 30 Under 30 selection. He often serves BBQ to the Longhorns \u2013 mostly to the big fellas who protect the quarterback.\n\nPinkerton arrived at Texas in 2007 and says he can't remember a player hyped like Manning. Maybe Vince Young. As for Manning's first start, Pinkerton views it as a welcome change. Games against a program like Louisiana Monroe used to be no guarantee, at least in the post-Mack Brown era (and at least in the fatalist minds of Longhorn fans). Now these games are an opportunity for young players like Manning to eat reps without a sense of dread that something could go terribly wrong.\n\n\n\n\"It's a luxury of being good,\" Pinkerton said.\n\nDick Perrone has followed Texas football longer than perhaps anybody on campus Saturday afternoon. He started selling Coca-Cola's in DKR at age 11 and graduated from the school in 1967. He used to play poker with program legend James Street \u2013 a perfect 20-0 as Texas' starting QB \u2013 on 6th Street; a famed party district in downtown Austin.\n\nPerrone, like everyone else, is intrigued by the Manning hype. Though he wonders what might happen if anything ever goes wrong.\n\n\"The name Manning carries a lot of weight out here,\" Perrone said. \"They just clap and go crazy when he comes out. I'd hate to see him make a mistake. They don't think he can.\"\n\nIt's fair to say Manning's time to start came a little before anyone expected -- even the merch shop in front of DKR.\n\nOne fan, David Thompson, asked an employee, \"Where are the Arch jerseys?\" There were none in stock, only a few T-shirts tucked in the back corner of the store.\n\nThompson, a 2008 grad, came to the game with his family. He wanted to be part of history.\n\n\"I've got the program that's going to be his first start,\" Thompson said. \"So, I'm going to get the rookie card, the program (and the jersey). I've got a picture of my ticket and I'm going to put it all on there and frame it up.\n\n\"Because he's going to be the No. 1 pick, for sure.\"\n\nHype, indeed.\n\nManning walked into the stadium wearing a dark blue suit, dapping up a few kids along the way. He did so to yells like, \"Big 'ol Arch!\" Any time his face popped up on the jumbotron in pre-game, the crowd went crazy. The biggest cheer came when a fan was shown holding a giant poster of Manning's now-famous Archibald Manning student ID, which he lost only a few days into his time in Austin.\n\nEverything is bigger in Texas. Even your former student ID, at least if you're Arch.\n\nEventually, Manning ran out of the tunnel, of course to massive cheers, and his first start began. But really, it didn't feel like the start of anything. Everyone knows Manning is coming. But Saturday, more than anything, felt like a big Hollywood trailer of a movie coming out next year.\n\nComing next fall to a stadium near you, Arch Manning.\n\n\"It feels like the future,\" Ramirez said.\n\nMORE: Recap Arch Manning's first career start with our live updates page"

        "article_content": "The veteran software company completed a stock split after its share price's meteoric rise.\n\nVeteran software firm MicroStrategy (MSTR 0.08%)joined several high-profile corporations, such as Nvidia, in executing a forward stock split this year. The company's 10-for-1 split occurred in August.\n\nMicroStrategy's decision to perform a stock split came on the heels of its share price skyrocketing over 100% in 2024. In fact, last October, shares were at a split-adjusted 52-week low of $30.71, but they zoomed as high as $200 this year. With its stock split completed, is now the time to invest in MicroStrategy?\n\nNot necessarily. While the split lowered the price of individual shares, it didn't change the company's overall market value. And assessing whether MicroStrategy is a good investment requires some investigative work to unravel the confusing contradiction between its share-price ascent and its mediocre business fundamentals.\n\nDissecting MicroStrategy's stock success\n\nDespite the surge in share price, MicroStrategy suffers from a trend of declining revenue. Through the first half of 2024, the firm's sales were $226.7 million, down from $242.3 million in the previous year.\n\nAdding to the contradiction between its share price performance and business results is the current consensus among Wall Street analysts. They rate MicroStrategy a buy with a median share-price target of $194, which suggests a belief in upside for the stock. This is in spite of the company exiting the second quarter with a net loss of $102.6 million.\n\nHow to explain this mystery? In a word, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). MicroStrategy began investing in the digital currency in 2020, and through the end of July, it amassed 226,500 Bitcoin. The firm describes itself as the \"largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world.\"\n\nAs the value of the cryptocurrency has risen over the past year, so has MicroStrategy stock. In fact, the company's share price follows Bitcoin pretty closely.\n\nIn short, the appreciation in the company's Bitcoin holdings, rather than the business intelligence (BI) software platform that launched the firm in 1989, accounted for its share-price growth.\n\nMicroStrategy's software business\n\nSpeaking of its core BI business, what is MicroStrategy doing with it these days? It's integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its software platform and transitioning to a subscription-based cloud computing model.\n\nPreviously, the company relied on selling software licenses, but the subscription approach provides predictable recurring revenue, and it's seeing strong customer adoption. For instance, its Q2 subscription income was $24.1 million, a 21% increase over the prior year's $19.9 million.\n\nWhile the subscription growth is encouraging, CEO Phong Le noted MicroStrategy's transition to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model \"may result in a decrease in total recognized revenue in the short term, but in the long run, we expect it to be more than offset by increases in subscription services revenue.\"\n\nThat's because software license sales recognize the full income upfront, but with a SaaS model, revenue is recognized over the life of the subscription term. This explains MicroStrategy's trend of declining revenue. The company expects this transition period to last 12 to 18 months, after which year-over-year revenue growth will start.\n\nThe pros and cons of investing\n\nSo far, MicroStrategy's unconventional approach of purchasing Bitcoin has paid off for investors. Between the time when it began buying Bitcoin in 2020 to the end of July, the company's stock price has risen 1,200%. That's far superior to the 64% growth of the S&P 500 index over that time, and even better than Nvidia stock's 948% increase.\n\nThe management team believes it can put cash on the balance sheet to better use by investing in digital capital, specifically Bitcoin. The idea has merit, and as long as the cryptocurrency increases in value over time, this strategy benefits the company.\n\nBut it's not without risk. MicroStrategy's fortunes are now coupled with Bitcoin. This means that what affects the digital currency will have a ripple effect on the firm's stock. For example, regulatory changes involving Bitcoin could have a substantial impact on MicroStrategy.\n\nAnother consideration is how the company is pursuing its Bitcoin strategy. It's funding Bitcoin purchases from the cash generated by its software business, taking on debt, and issuing stock. Over the long term, MicroStrategy's goal is to accumulate Bitcoin faster than it issues shares to generate value for shareholders.\n\nHowever, its cryptocurrency strategy led to the firm accruing a lot of debt on its balance sheet. At the end of Q2, MicroStrategy's total liabilities were $4.2 billion, $3.8 billion of that in debt. Meanwhile, total assets were $7.1 billion, including $5.7 billion in digital assets, namely Bitcoin, and $66.9 million in cash and equivalents.\n\nThis brought MicroStrategy's Q2 debt ratio to 0.55, or 55%. That's an increase from 2023's 0.46, when debt was $2.2 billion and total assets were $4.8 billion.\n\nIn addition, there's the matter of MicroStrategy's core software business. If it fails to grow this business, the company could end up struggling to pay its debt, let alone fund more Bitcoin purchases.\n\nSo for now, buying MicroStrategy stock is only for investors with a high risk tolerance. It's best to reconsider the company after its software business shows year-over-year revenue growth and its balance sheet strengthens."

        "article_content": "I probably shouldn\u2019t have done it, but ahead of saying goodbye to my original Apple Watch Ultra, I put it back on to test out watchOS 11.\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t I have reacquainted myself with Apple\u2019s chunkiest smartwatch? Despite initially not being that bothered about moving on, I\u2019m now having second thoughts about it.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhy I\u2019m getting rid of my Ultra\n\nThe reason I\u2019m saying goodbye to the Apple Watch Ultra is very simple. It\u2019s being traded in against the new Apple Watch Series 10 in titanium. This is a very expensive smartwatch, and using an old Apple Watch to reduce the price helps soften the blow. I haven\u2019t bought a regular Apple Watch since the Apple Watch Series 7, and its trade-in value is tiny compared to the Apple Watch Ultra\u2019s value. So, that\u2019s the one I chose to send Apple\u2019s way in exchange for 280 British pounds, which is around a $370 price reduction.\n\nAt the time, I was totally enamored with the new Series 10 and very keen to see if the titanium version would feel special enough to be considered a luxury smartwatch. As I hadn\u2019t worn the Apple Watch Ultra for a while, I didn\u2019t spend long considering the deal. Then, as the Series 10\u2019s launch day approached, I retrieved the Watch Ultra to unpair it and prepare to send it away, but then Apple released watchOS 11.\n\nSeeing as I was getting the Apple Watch Ultra out anyway, and that this would be the last time I\u2019d likely spend any time with one, I installed watchOS 11 to give it a try. That was a couple of days ago, and rather than feel nothing for the Watch Ultra, I\u2019ve remembered why I fell for it in the first place. Plus, running watchOS 11 has shown me it\u2019s still a top performer today, and that anyone considering upgrading should think about their decision very seriously.\n\nWearing it again\n\nThe last time I spent time with the Apple Watch Ultra, I did so with it attached to a Solo Loop band, which minimized the size and weight so I could wear it for longer. This time I reverted back to the original Ocean Band. The same little problems are still there, as it\u2019s unforgiving on your wrist and can get quite hot, but it also still looks excellent and with a quick rinse under a running tap to get rid of some accumulated dust, it looks as good as new.\n\nTogether with the Apple Watch Ultra\u2019s case, the combination makes it a large and fairly heavy pairing, but depending on what you\u2019re used to, it likely won\u2019t take much adjustment before you forget all about it. During a recent trip to Berlin, I chose to wear a Casio G-Shock MTG-B1000XB watch (a bit like this one, but in blue and carbon) that weighs around 120 grams and has a 55mm case. The 95-gram, 49mm Apple Watch Ultra feels almost dainty after that. It\u2019s also a testament to Apple\u2019s excellent design, as the curvy case and smoothed-out button and crown guard means it never digs into your wrist.\n\nThe numbers have never been truly representative of how the Apple Watch Ultra feels to wear anyway. It\u2019s smaller and lighter than you expect, even if you\u2019re used to a regular Apple Watch. This hasn\u2019t changed over time either, as even though I\u2019ve been wearing an Apple Watch Series 9 regularly over the past year, putting the Ultra back on hasn\u2019t left me wanting to change back. I also still love the design with its chunky profile, flat screen, and rough-and-tumble button guard. It\u2019s purposeful without going over the top, yet still unique enough to make a statement.\n\nHas watchOS 11 ruined it?\n\nThe good news is that watchOS 11 has done nothing but keep the Apple Watch Ultra ticking along, but the lack of a couple of features has made me feel a little better about my decision to trade the smartwatch in. The Watch Ultra is smooth and fast with the latest software installed, and while it doesn\u2019t change things much, it\u2019s good to see the Translate app is present and working and the Vitals app installed, too. Outside of Vitals, though, there\u2019s not much in watchOS 11 that I\u2019ll use on a day-to-day basis.\n\nCertainly, if you own an Apple Watch Ultra, there\u2019s no reason not to install watchOS 11. Still, it exposes a couple of unfortunate feature omissions on the Watch Ultra, which may prompt you to consider upgrading to the Watch Ultra 2 or the Apple Watch Series 10 this year. The original Watch Ultra does not support Double Tap, the gesture control introduced with the Series 9, and although it hasn\u2019t seen the upgrades I hoped it would this year, it\u2019s still fun and helpful.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra also does not support Apple\u2019s new Sleep Apnea monitoring feature. Although I do not suffer from the condition, it is worth monitoring over time as it is hard to identify. If you\u2019re at all curious about it, then you may decide now is the time to upgrade your Apple Watch Ultra to the Ultra 2 or a Series 10. You will miss out on these two features if you stick with the original Watch Ultra.\n\nSecond thoughts\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra isn\u2019t the latest and greatest Apple Watch, but it runs the latest software, looks brilliant (and exactly the same as the Watch Ultra 2), wears smaller than its dimensions suggest, has the right adventure watch credentials, and is genuinely tough enough to survive some pretty intensive punishment. Pairing it with my iPhone 15 Pro Max reminded me how quick and easy the setup process is, it has delivered all my notifications reliably, there are many native apps available, and I love that I can control my music from it too. I\u2019m also not the only one to feel this way about it.\n\nDouble Tap wasn\u2019t a reason to buy the Series 9 and isn\u2019t a reason to get the Ultra 2 or Series 10, either. Not everyone will be concerned about sleep apnea monitoring or may already have it on another wearable like the Oura Ring. If that\u2019s you, and you have the Watch Ultra on your wrist right now, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth upgrading it at all this year. I\u2019m trading mine in as part of my job (at least, I\u2019m telling myself that), but if I didn\u2019t want to experience the titanium Series 10, then after wearing Ultra again for a few days, I think it would be staying where it is.\n\nWhat\u2019s very interesting to me is one of the reasons I\u2019m going to try the titanium Series 10 is to see if it can truly feel special. To do this, I\u2019ll have to want to wear it often as part of what makes a watch special to me is when I build memories with it. The Apple Watch Ultra\u2019s ability and action-adventure credentials mean it\u2019s highly likely that some wearers will do exactly this. It gives me considerable hope for the titanium Series 10 and serves as a reminder that, unlike so many smartwatches, the Apple Watch Ultra does have its own personality. I\u2019ll package the Watch Ultra to send away soon, but I will be sad about it. In the meantime, I\u2019m going to enjoy it for a little while longer."
