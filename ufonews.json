The UFO \u2015 which the U.S. government now calls UAPs, or unidentified aerial phenomena \u2015 had no engine and no thermal signature.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconsistent with anything I\u2019d ever seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cI can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.\u201d\n\nBarber said it was later confirmed to him that the object was from a \u201cnonhuman intelligence,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t know what it was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said he also picked up what he called an \u201ceightgon,\u201d which he described as \u201ca flying disc with what looked like eight delineated sections.\u201d Barber described feeling \u201codd\u201d and growing more emotional as he got closer to the \u201ceightgon\u201d object.\n\n\u201cI felt like something connected with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like something had tuned in to me and my soul and was providing me some sense of guidance on what to do and how profound what I was doing was. It was so overwhelming that I began to cry.\u201d\n\nNewsNation also said it independently obtained footage of an egg-shaped object being moved by helicopter:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile few details can be seen, the object isn\u2019t dissimilar to some of those seen in flight in prior videos from other whistleblowers, footage later confirmed by the Pentagon as authentic.\n\nOne, called the \u201cTic Tac\u201d because of its similarity to the mint candies, shows a white object with no visible wings or engines moving rapidly through the sky as pilots react in awe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been no clear answer as to what the objects are, but some observers have noted that there are more down-to-earth explanations for them, such as drones or balloons, in some cases of potentially foreign origin and with advanced \u2015 but not alien \u2015 technology."

Would we expect anything different from the state that was used as the setting in the \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d broadcast?\n\nUFOs (or UAPs if you want to go with the latest terminology which hasn\u2019t fully caught on yet, unidentified aerial phenomena) have been reported in New Jersey for generations. One of the first notable sightings came in 1966 when a mysterious glowing object was seen over Wanaque.\n\nIt started on Jan. 11 when people from many other towns were among callers to police that they saw the strange object over the Wanaque reservoir. Calls came from Ringwood, Totowa, Paterson, Oakland, and even Butler. It was described as between 2 to 9 feet with a light brighter than any star changing from white to red to green and it was reported the object moved in a manner no man-made aircraft could.\n\nWhat made this sighting so credible is the huge number of people reporting it. Even the mayor of Wanaque saw this.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon was terribly strange,\u201d Mayor Harry T. Wolfe explained. He described it as an oval object.\n\nWitness calls came in from a 20-mile radius. The closest reported seeing this thing burn a hole in the reservoir\u2019s ice, a brilliant light beam shooting down from the object.\n\nCanva / TSM Illustration Canva / TSM Illustration loading...\n\nIt didn\u2019t end there. The next day, Jan. 12, a police officer, Jack Wardlaw, reported he witnessed a brilliant white disc floating near his home in the Wanaque\u2019s Stonetown section.\n\nWardlaw described it as \u201cdefinitely disc-shaped and at certain angles, egg-shaped.\u201d\n\nStacker compiled a list of New Jersey towns with the most UFO sightings in the last 30 years.

            "article_content": "We\u2019ve been talking about AI agents for several months now, as they\u2019re seen as the next big thing in genAI tech. Some companies have started showing off their agents. OpenAI made the first moves by giving ChatGPT the ability to interact with some Mac apps. The newly launched ChatGPT Tasks feature also falls within the same category of AI products; programs that can do things for you. The more sophisticated Operator AI agent OpenAI is reportedly working on is still not official.\n\nThen there\u2019s Google, which unveiled some of its agents last month, including Project Mariner. That\u2019s an AI agent that can browse the web for you for specific actions. Anthropic has its own computer-controlling AI Agent.\n\nEven Apple\u2019s Siri should get agentic abilities in Apple Intelligence come iOS 18.4. Siri will be able to control some apps and access more user data to provide more helpful assistance. But Siri doesn\u2019t have chatbot abilities, which would let the user control the AI via natural language.\n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at is that we\u2019re still in the very early days of AI\u2019s agentic abilities. All this software is still in testing ahead of commercial releases. Unsurprisingly, OpenAI might be among the first AI firms to release a true AI agent for ChatGPT. According to evidence found in the Mac app and online, it might happen imminently.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, Tibor Blaho is a software engineer with a reputation for leaking upcoming AI products.\n\nBlaho took to X to post evidence that ChatGPT\u2019s Operator agent is coming soon. The ChatGPT app for Mac contains new options that are hidden for now. The shortcuts read Toggle Operator and Force Quite Operator.\n\nConfirmed \u2013 the ChatGPT macOS desktop app has hidden options to define shortcuts for the desktop launcher to \"Toggle Operator\" and \"Force Quit Operator\" https://t.co/rSFobi4iPN pic.twitter.com/j19YSlexAS \u2014 Tibor Blaho (@btibor91) January 19, 2025\n\nOpenAI\u2019s website contains tables comparing Operator\u2019s performance to that of other AI agents. However, these are not official, so the information in them might not be accurate.\n\nIf the figures are real, then the OpenAI Computer Use Agent (CUA), aka Operator, outscores the Anthropic AI agent in OSWorld, with 38.1%. That benchmark tries to mimic a real computer environment, where humans score 72.4%. Operator outperforms humans in WebVoyager but can\u2019t match them in WebArena, other benchmarks mentioned in the tables.\n\nThe leaks also say that Operators struggle with tasks that a human could do easily. For example, Operator was successful only 60% of the time in a test that requested the AI agent sign up for a cloud provider and launch a virtual machine. That dropped to 10% when tasked with creating a Bitcoin wallet.\n\nOpenAI website already has references to Operator/OpenAI CUA (Computer Use Agent) \u2013 \"Operator System Card Table\", \"Operator Research Eval Table\" and \"Operator Refusal Rate Table\"\n\n\n\nIncluding comparison to Claude 3.5 Sonnet Computer use, Google Mariner, etc.\n\n\n\n(preview of tables\u2026 pic.twitter.com/OOBgC3ddkU \u2014 Tibor Blaho (@btibor91) January 20, 2025\n\nThe leaks do not include a list of Operator\u2019s capabilities. I\u2019m dreaming about being able to control my computer by voice. I want to tell the AI which apps to handle on my behalf, what sites to browse on its own for research, and what programs to run. But it\u2019s too soon to expect all that from ChatGPT\u2019s first Operator.\n\nI definitely wouldn\u2019t trust the AI to do either of the actions mentioned above. I\u2019d want to sign up for services on my own and create Bitcoin wallets without genAI products helping out. I would not trust the AI with such information. It will eventually happen, but Operator has to gain that trust.\n\nOperator has to start somewhere when it comes to controlling computer apps. Browsing the web seems like the simplest thing you\u2019d want the AI to do for you. Google\u2019s Project Mariner is proof of that. But we\u2019ll have to wait for OpenAI to announce the Operator AI agent to see what it can do.\n\nGiven Blaho\u2019s findings, it sure looks like OpenAI is preparing for an announcement. Previous reports said Operator might drop this month, and the leaks support those claims. Remember that OpenAI also said in December the next-gen ChatGPT reasoning model, o3, should be ready this month. Sam Altman tweeted on Friday that safety testing for o3-mini has been successful, suggesting a launch is imminent.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no necessary connection between o3 and Operator, it would make sense for ChatGPT to make both products available to ChatGPT users around the same time. This is all speculation, but we might learn more details about OpenAI\u2019s next ChatGPT upgrades by the end of January."

Hidden from the outside world for thousands of years, a unique population of crocodiles has adapted to their dark, isolated home. This article uncovers the secrets behind these fascinating creatures.\n\nDiscovery of the Cave Crocodiles\n\nIn 2008, archaeologist Richard Oslisly uncovered a population of dwarf crocodiles in the Abanda caves. These reptiles, believed to be trapped for 3,000 years, have evolved remarkable traits to survive in complete darkness. Unlike their relatives, they no longer rely on sunlight to regulate their metabolism, showcasing the incredible resilience of life.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nA comparison of crocodiles lying on their backs. (Image credit: Olivier Testa, CC BY-SA 3.0 , via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nHow Cave Crocodiles Differ from Forest Relatives\n\nCave crocodiles feed on bats and crickets rather than fish. Studies suggest they are healthier than forest-dwelling crocodiles, likely due to abundant food and a lack of predators. Genetic analysis has revealed unique traits, with some crocodiles even developing a distinct orange hue, possibly from exposure to bat guano.\n\nA young African dwarf crocodile on the cave floor. Researchers discovered that their diet consists mainly of crickets and bats. (Image credit: Olivier Testa, CC BY-SA 3.0 , via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nEvolution into a New Species\n\nThe cave crocodiles are genetically distinct from their forest counterparts. Over time, their isolation has led to the development of new traits, signalling their evolution into a separate species. Researchers believe this process may continue as the crocodiles adapt further to their unique environment.\n\nThese extraordinary crocodiles offer insight into the adaptability of life. Their continued study will reveal more about evolution's power and the mysteries hidden beneath the earth."

            "article_content": "All the key players in cyber-security make predictions at the end of every year and 2025 is no exception, there was a flurry of predictions which are nicely summarized here.\n\nSo why would we add our thoughts to an already crowded field (and in January..)? Well no one seems to have looked specifically at mobile cybersecurity. As everyone should know by now, mobile app security is an issue which must be taken seriously, and having some insight into key trends is important.\n\nWe do think that our expansive customer base, ongoing research initiatives and the insights we collect from our live threat metrics, give us some visibility into trends. So here goes\u2026If you are responsible for mobile app security, here are seven mobile security trends to think about. We hope this helps you prepare your own plan for navigating the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in 2025.\n\nThe 7 Big Mobile Security Trends to Plan for in 2025\n\n1. Alternative app stores are so 2024! \u201cDirect to consumer\u201d will be the new trend in 2025\n\nWe have reported extensively on the pressure building on Apple and Google during 2024 to break up their lucrative monopolistic practices which lock in developers. Alternative app stores like the one from Epic Games are up and running. This pressure will increase in 2025 but a whole new front will open up too. 2024 was all about allowing alternative app stores and payment mechanisms, but next up will be a drive to direct-to-consumer models \u2013 why do I even need an app store? When I download an app on my laptop, I go right ahead and the laptop manufacturer has no part to play. A new court case in the UK is a sign of what\u2019s to come. Expect continued engagement from the Coalition for App Fairness and from governments around the world to drive this forward. This trend will cause mobile app security to be re-evaluated in 2025: alternatives to native security will need to be found.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nAs it becomes clear that security provided by Apple, Google, Huawei is actually quite limited, and in any case do not work with alternative app stores and direct to consumer models, it makes a lot of sense to try to find a cross-platform security solution which makes it easy for you to embrace new approaches and platforms.\n\n2. AI Will Continue to be Adopted by Hackers \u2026 and Security Teams\n\n2024 was the year when AI started being used everywhere, especially generative AI tools.\n\n\u201cAgentic AI\u201d, which is capable of independently planning and acting to achieve specific goals, will be exploited by threat actors, and this is unfortunately a good fit for mobile app attacks where attackers orchestrate complex attacks which involve gathering data from a number of sources before using this data to create automated exploits. Another looming threat in 2025 is AI tools making code obfuscation even less effective. Obfuscation methods have been used extensively to protect mobile app code and IP, but AI tools are making it easier than ever for attackers to undo obfuscation.\n\nOn the other hand, AI is also being used to build better defenses. Machine learning has been employed by security tools for a while in app security, particularly where user behaviour or other non-deterministic signals need to be assessed and classified. Concerns have been raised however about the \u201cblack box\u201d nature of some of the tools and the AI skills gap in most organizations. OWASP published their first Top 10 for LLM Applications and a guide to AI for CISOs in 2024.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nAI should always be a means to an end, and clear goals such should be set for any new deployment e.g. you must quantify the resource savings and process improvements expected from the automation of security tasks, set a goal for time to market speed increase from faster identification of vulnerabilities etc. It also always makes sense to prioritize deterministic solutions for particular use-cases as alternatives to AI, if such solutions exist, to minimize the risk of false positives.\n\n3. 2025 Will Be When API Keys in Mobile Apps Are Properly Secured\n\n2024 has been a terrible year for API secrets protection. It continued to be easy to find secrets in mobile app code and it seemed like hardly a week went by without another breach being reported due to theft and misuse of API credentials. Our own research and many other reports show the extent of the problem. The Internet Archive had a nightmare scenario where even after a breach was reported attackers continued to use stolen Zendesk API keys, suggesting that the organization had some challenges rotating compromised keys when an issue was identified. It\u2019s not a surprise that credential management is number 1 on the OWASP Mobile Top Ten but will 2025 be the year when the problem is finally addressed? We really hope so!\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nThe only practical way to ensure secrets are safe is to adopt a dynamic, zero trust security approach. Get them out of your code, and have them delivered only as needed, and only to apps which are verified via attestation. Also make sure they can be updated and rotated immediately across all your apps immediately as required.\n\n4. Cross-Platform Development Will Be The Way Forward For Mobile Apps\n\nIn 2025, cross-platform mobile development is expected to be dominated by frameworks like Flutter, React Native, and Xamarin, with a strong focus on achieving near-native performance, leveraging advanced features like AI/ML integration, and catering to new devices and emerging technologies. We predict that we will see \u201cofficial\u201d support of the HarmonyOS ecosystem in 2025 by the biggest players.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nIf you are still developing your apps using native tools, now is the time to consider migrating to a cross-platform framework, or at least moving to a hybrid approach. This should generate substantial cost savings. It\u2019s also time to evaluate your security. There are good third-party security solutions which integrate with cross-platform frameworks in order to provide advanced security across platforms in a consistent and unified way. So you can get the benefits of cross-platform development and improve your security at the same time.\n\n5. Open Source Scrutiny Will Increase\n\nThe mobile ecosystem is highly dependent on open source software and it remains a reliable driver of innovation. However 2024 saw some major issues including the vulnerabilities found in the Cocoapods dependency manager. Clearly, hackers see a path to commit supply chain attacks that could introduce malicious code updates to the corporate software projects that rely on them. During 2024 we also saw governments start to take an interest. The EU has passed the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and we can expect to see the U.S. gradually developing tighter requirements, on software components especially for software for critical infrastructure and government use.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nIn preparation for regulations or issues that could disrupt your own software supply chain, you should audit your open source components and dependencies and evaluate alternatives for any risky components of your app. You should also, of course, implement robust dependency management to track and manage open source use and ensure you\u2019re using the latest secure versions as well as investing in frequent vulnerability scanning. You must also invest in runtime protection of your app to provide an additional layer of security.\n\n5. Pinning Communications Channels Will Become The Norm\n\nMan-in-the-Middle attacks continue to be a clear and present danger to mobile apps. Tools such as Proxyman and mitmproxy can be used to intercept encrypted traffic to and from the app. Certificate pinning is the solution and OWASP recommends it. But operational challenges and potential disruptions caused when a certificate changes or expires means that devops teams have been wary of implementing this critical way of protecting the communications channels your app uses.\n\nThere are, in fact, solutions that make administration of pinning easy and maintain customer experience. These facilitate the kind of immediate rotation required when Digicert revoked thousands of certificates in July 2024. We believe that 2025 will be the year that these types of dynamic certificate pinning solutions will finally be adopted, eliminating an important attack surface for hackers.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nEvaluating and implementing dynamic certificate pinning on any communications channels your app uses would be a good security improvement to plan for 2025.\n\n6. Breach reporting requirements will require more attention and investment\n\nBreach reporting requirements around the world have become more onerous in 2024, especially in the EU, Japan and Singapore. This trend will continue into 2025. Some industries such as US Healthcare and financial institutions will face even stricter requirements. For the finance industry, PCI DSS 4.0 compliance is coming in 2025. Concerning mobile app breaches, companies are generally required to notify affected users \u201cwithout unreasonable delay\u201d and within a specific timeframe, providing details of the breach, notifying relevant regulatory bodies at the same time.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nYou need to understand the reporting requirements of the industry and the geographies in which you operate and make sure your incident response plan addresses evolving reporting requirements. You should rehearse thoroughly the procedures you will follow if and when there is a breach. In addition, service continuity in the event of a breach should be a key objective for the development team.\n\nFor mobile apps specifically, the playbook must include information about rotating any secrets and certificates your app uses, including third-party API keys. You should also include procedures on how you can quickly block rogue devices and apps without affecting genuine users.\n\nKey Takeaway \u2013 Run Time Protection\n\nAll of this can be overwhelming but there is one single key takeaway and that is a need to focus on runtime protection for mobile apps. Robust run time protection that works across platforms can prevent apps or devices being tampered with and adds a zero trust layer to other protections that you put in place \u2013 every request can be validated. It can also mitigate the limitations of code obfuscation. Dynamic management can allow you to identify and deal with issues as they arise without having to release new versions of your app. A solution such as Approov can continuously verify all aspects of the running mobile ecosystem and allow you to future proof your mobile app security.\n\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from Approov Blog authored by George McGregor.

Hidden from the outside world for thousands of years, a unique population of crocodiles has adapted to their dark, isolated home. This article uncovers the secrets behind these fascinating creatures.\n\nDiscovery of the Cave Crocodiles\n\nIn 2008, archaeologist Richard Oslisly uncovered a population of dwarf crocodiles in the Abanda caves. These reptiles, believed to be trapped for 3,000 years, have evolved remarkable traits to survive in complete darkness. Unlike their relatives, they no longer rely on sunlight to regulate their metabolism, showcasing the incredible resilience of life.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nA comparison of crocodiles lying on their backs.

Studies suggest they are healthier than forest-dwelling crocodiles, likely due to abundant food and a lack of predators. Genetic analysis has revealed unique traits, with some crocodiles even developing a distinct orange hue, possibly from exposure to bat guano.\n\nA young African dwarf crocodile on the cave floor. Researchers discovered that their diet consists mainly of crickets and bats. (Image credit: Olivier Testa, CC BY-SA 3.0 , via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nEvolution into a New Species\n\nThe cave crocodiles are genetically distinct from their forest counterparts. Over time, their isolation has led to the development of new traits, signalling their evolution into a separate species. Researchers believe this process may continue as the crocodiles adapt further to their unique environment.\n\nThese extraordinary crocodiles offer insight into the adaptability of life. Their continued study will reveal more about evolution's power and the mysteries hidden beneath the earth."

            "article_content": "All the key players in cyber-security make predictions at the end of every year and 2025 is no exception, there was a flurry of predictions which are nicely summarized here.\n\nSo why would we add our thoughts to an already crowded field (and in January..)? Well no one seems to have looked specifically at mobile cybersecurity. As everyone should know by now, mobile app security is an issue which must be taken seriously, and having some insight into key trends is important.\n\nWe do think that our expansive customer base, ongoing research initiatives and the insights we collect from our live threat metrics, give us some visibility into trends. So here goes\u2026If you are responsible for mobile app security, here are seven mobile security trends to think about. We hope this helps you prepare your own plan for navigating the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in 2025.\n\nThe 7 Big Mobile Security Trends to Plan for in 2025\n\n1. Alternative app stores are so 2024! \u201cDirect to consumer\u201d will be the new trend in 2025\n\nWe have reported extensively on the pressure building on Apple and Google during 2024 to break up their lucrative monopolistic practices which lock in developers. Alternative app stores like the one from Epic Games are up and running. This pressure will increase in 2025 but a whole new front will open up too. 2024 was all about allowing alternative app stores and payment mechanisms, but next up will be a drive to direct-to-consumer models \u2013 why do I even need an app store? When I download an app on my laptop, I go right ahead and the laptop manufacturer has no part to play. A new court case in the UK is a sign of what\u2019s to come. Expect continued engagement from the Coalition for App Fairness and from governments around the world to drive this forward. This trend will cause mobile app security to be re-evaluated in 2025: alternatives to native security will need to be found.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nAs it becomes clear that security provided by Apple, Google, Huawei is actually quite limited, and in any case do not work with alternative app stores and direct to consumer models, it makes a lot of sense to try to find a cross-platform security solution which makes it easy for you to embrace new approaches and platforms.\n\n2. AI Will Continue to be Adopted by Hackers \u2026 and Security Teams\n\n2024 was the year when AI started being used everywhere, especially generative AI tools.\n\n\u201cAgentic AI\u201d, which is capable of independently planning and acting to achieve specific goals, will be exploited by threat actors, and this is unfortunately a good fit for mobile app attacks where attackers orchestrate complex attacks which involve gathering data from a number of sources before using this data to create automated exploits. Another looming threat in 2025 is AI tools making code obfuscation even less effective. Obfuscation methods have been used extensively to protect mobile app code and IP, but AI tools are making it easier than ever for attackers to undo obfuscation.\n\nOn the other hand, AI is also being used to build better defenses. Machine learning has been employed by security tools for a while in app security, particularly where user behaviour or other non-deterministic signals need to be assessed and classified. Concerns have been raised however about the \u201cblack box\u201d nature of some of the tools and the AI skills gap in most organizations. OWASP published their first Top 10 for LLM Applications and a guide to AI for CISOs in 2024.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nAI should always be a means to an end, and clear goals such should be set for any new deployment e.g. you must quantify the resource savings and process improvements expected from the automation of security tasks, set a goal for time to market speed increase from faster identification of vulnerabilities etc. It also always makes sense to prioritize deterministic solutions for particular use-cases as alternatives to AI, if such solutions exist, to minimize the risk of false positives.\n\n3. 2025 Will Be When API Keys in Mobile Apps Are Properly Secured\n\n2024 has been a terrible year for API secrets protection. It continued to be easy to find secrets in mobile app code and it seemed like hardly a week went by without another breach being reported due to theft and misuse of API credentials. Our own research and many other reports show the extent of the problem. The Internet Archive had a nightmare scenario where even after a breach was reported attackers continued to use stolen Zendesk API keys, suggesting that the organization had some challenges rotating compromised keys when an issue was identified. It\u2019s not a surprise that credential management is number 1 on the OWASP Mobile Top Ten but will 2025 be the year when the problem is finally addressed? We really hope so!\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nThe only practical way to ensure secrets are safe is to adopt a dynamic, zero trust security approach. Get them out of your code, and have them delivered only as needed, and only to apps which are verified via attestation. Also make sure they can be updated and rotated immediately across all your apps immediately as required.\n\n4. Cross-Platform Development Will Be The Way Forward For Mobile Apps\n\nIn 2025, cross-platform mobile development is expected to be dominated by frameworks like Flutter, React Native, and Xamarin, with a strong focus on achieving near-native performance, leveraging advanced features like AI/ML integration, and catering to new devices and emerging technologies. We predict that we will see \u201cofficial\u201d support of the HarmonyOS ecosystem in 2025 by the biggest players.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nIf you are still developing your apps using native tools, now is the time to consider migrating to a cross-platform framework, or at least moving to a hybrid approach. This should generate substantial cost savings. It\u2019s also time to evaluate your security. There are good third-party security solutions which integrate with cross-platform frameworks in order to provide advanced security across platforms in a consistent and unified way. So you can get the benefits of cross-platform development and improve your security at the same time.\n\n5. Open Source Scrutiny Will Increase\n\nThe mobile ecosystem is highly dependent on open source software and it remains a reliable driver of innovation. However 2024 saw some major issues including the vulnerabilities found in the Cocoapods dependency manager. Clearly, hackers see a path to commit supply chain attacks that could introduce malicious code updates to the corporate software projects that rely on them. During 2024 we also saw governments start to take an interest. The EU has passed the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and we can expect to see the U.S. gradually developing tighter requirements, on software components especially for software for critical infrastructure and government use.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nIn preparation for regulations or issues that could disrupt your own software supply chain, you should audit your open source components and dependencies and evaluate alternatives for any risky components of your app. You should also, of course, implement robust dependency management to track and manage open source use and ensure you\u2019re using the latest secure versions as well as investing in frequent vulnerability scanning. You must also invest in runtime protection of your app to provide an additional layer of security.\n\n5. Pinning Communications Channels Will Become The Norm\n\nMan-in-the-Middle attacks continue to be a clear and present danger to mobile apps. Tools such as Proxyman and mitmproxy can be used to intercept encrypted traffic to and from the app. Certificate pinning is the solution and OWASP recommends it. But operational challenges and potential disruptions caused when a certificate changes or expires means that devops teams have been wary of implementing this critical way of protecting the communications channels your app uses.\n\nThere are, in fact, solutions that make administration of pinning easy and maintain customer experience. These facilitate the kind of immediate rotation required when Digicert revoked thousands of certificates in July 2024. We believe that 2025 will be the year that these types of dynamic certificate pinning solutions will finally be adopted, eliminating an important attack surface for hackers.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nEvaluating and implementing dynamic certificate pinning on any communications channels your app uses would be a good security improvement to plan for 2025.\n\n6. Breach reporting requirements will require more attention and investment\n\nBreach reporting requirements around the world have become more onerous in 2024, especially in the EU, Japan and Singapore. This trend will continue into 2025. Some industries such as US Healthcare and financial institutions will face even stricter requirements. For the finance industry, PCI DSS 4.0 compliance is coming in 2025. Concerning mobile app breaches, companies are generally required to notify affected users \u201cwithout unreasonable delay\u201d and within a specific timeframe, providing details of the breach, notifying relevant regulatory bodies at the same time.\n\nHow to Adapt Your Security Strategy to Meet This Challenge\n\nYou need to understand the reporting requirements of the industry and the geographies in which you operate and make sure your incident response plan addresses evolving reporting requirements. You should rehearse thoroughly the procedures you will follow if and when there is a breach. In addition, service continuity in the event of a breach should be a key objective for the development team.\n\nFor mobile apps specifically, the playbook must include information about rotating any secrets and certificates your app uses, including third-party API keys. You should also include procedures on how you can quickly block rogue devices and apps without affecting genuine users.\n\nKey Takeaway \u2013 Run Time Protection\n\nAll of this can be overwhelming but there is one single key takeaway and that is a need to focus on runtime protection for mobile apps. Robust run time protection that works across platforms can prevent apps or devices being tampered with and adds a zero trust layer to other protections that you put in place \u2013 every request can be validated. It can also mitigate the limitations of code obfuscation. Dynamic management can allow you to identify and deal with issues as they arise without having to release new versions of your app. A solution such as Approov can continuously verify all aspects of the running mobile ecosystem and allow you to future proof your mobile app security.\n\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from Approov Blog authored by George McGregor.

Many believed that the modern world, shaped by institutions and economic interdependence, had moved beyond such conflicts. Yet, these assumptions now appear increasingly tenuous. Today, the dynamics of great-power competition and regional instability suggest that the world has not left these patterns behind but is instead witnessing their resurgence in new forms. The growing rivalry between the United States and China has been described as a \u2018Cold War II\u2019, evoking comparisons to the ideological and strategic tensions of the mid-20th century. At the same time, discussions of a potential \u2018World War III\u2019, once confined to speculative fiction, have entered the realm of serious analysis among policymakers and academics. These concerns are not abstract."

            "article_content": "By Steven Scheer\n\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel spent about 100 billion shekels ($28 billion) on military conflicts in 2024, the finance ministry said on Tuesday, a figure that has sharply pushed up government borrowing and the country's debt burden.\n\nThe ratio of public debt to gross domestic product rose to 69.0% at the end of last year, from 61.3% in 2023.\n\nThe ratio has risen 9 percentage points over the past two years, largely due to Israel's wars against Palestinian militant groups Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Ceasefire deals have been made in recent weeks to end the fighting.\n\nEntering the Gaza war in 2023, Israel's low debt-to-GDP ratio provided flexibility, allowing funding to support displaced populations, businesses and reservists, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said.\n\n\"The debt-to-GDP ratio in 2024 reflects the significant governmental response to war needs, both on the security and civilian fronts,\" Accountant General Yali Rothenberg said, adding it must return to a declining trajectory \"as soon as possible\".\n\nStill, Israel's debt-to-GDP ratio remains lower than 88.1% in the euro bloc, 121% in the United States and 251.2% in Japan, the ministry said, citing IMF data.\n\nTotal government debt rose to 1.33 trillion shekels last year from 1.13 trillion in 2023. Government spending in 2024 was 621 billion shekels, with 100 billion of that on the wars.\n\nDuring 2024, the state raised 278 billion shekels - 79% through Israel's bond market. Another 19% was raised in global bond issues and the rest in domestic non-tradable debt.\n\nLast March, Israel raised a record $8 billion in an international offering of 10 and 30-year bonds.\n\nSince the start of the Gaza war, which began after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has raised 360 billion shekels - 272 billion of which locally and 83 billion globally.\n\nIt raised 160 billion shekels in 2023 and 63 billion in 2022.\n\n\"The ability to raise debt on a large scale is a result of Israel's sophisticated and deep capital market, a strong economy, and a stable financial system,\" Rothenberg said.\n\nIsrael's budget deficit reached 6.9% in 2024, its highest level since 11.6% in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic. All three agencies lowered Israel's credit rating in 2024.\n\n($1 = 3.5760 shekels)\n\n(Reporting by Steven Scheer; Editing by Alison Williams and Christina Fincher)\n\nCopyright 2025 Thomson Reuters."

            "source": "Business Insider",
            "article_content": "It's a challenging job market for candidates in the ad industry.\n\nRecruiters and industry insiders say there are bright spots for job seekers with the right skills.\n\nAdvertising employees with expertise in data, tech, and client relations remain in demand.\n\nIt's set to be one of the most volatile years yet for the advertising industry.\n\nThere's massive ad agency consolidation, return-to-office mandates, and the opportunities and threats posed by artificial intelligence.\n\nIt's a lot.\n\nSo, spare a thought for the ad industry workers trying to figure out their next career moves. Do they stay on Madison Avenue? Or take the first exit?\n\nThe challenging outlook for job hunters is true for those in the early stages of their careers all the way through to the senior ranks. But headhunters, human resources execs, consultants, and other industry insiders told Business Insider there are bright spots for employees who can double down on the skills that are in demand from ad bosses. Those with the best chance of success will be able to demonstrate data and tech capabilities, as well as a bulging Rolodex of top client contacts.\n\n\"If you have not been pioneering in AI and data-driven roles in the last 900 days, I don't know what we can offer you,\" said Michele James, founder of James & Co, United Talent Agency's executive search practice.\n\nJames added that there would be little interest for a senior leader \"if you don't have interpretative data management skills, a machine learning strategy, if you can't be a player-coach to your client partners.\" James said this reflects the transformation of the ad industry.\n\nOver time, advertising agencies have expanded their services from creating and distributing ads, to an offering more akin to consultancies, moving into areas such as digital transformation, data strategy, and commerce. As client demands for these services grow, agencies are seeking allrounders who can bring it all together.\n\n\"Both brand owners and agency groups are hiring leaders whose skillset equips them to build and choreograph data, tech, and content capabilities at scale,\" said Gary Stolkin, CEO of The Talent Business, an executive search firm.\n\nA tough advertising job market \u2014 with some bright spots\n\nEmployment in advertising, PR, and related services jobs in the US declined by 1,500 jobs in December to 520,800, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 as overall US employment grew by 256,000 jobs.\n\nAd industry job hunters are encouraged to seek out businesses in growth mode, such as those that have recently taken on private equity investment and are now bulking up. Chelsea Jia Feng/BI\n\nWhile ad industry employment was up by 2,900 jobs versus December 2023, industry insiders said there were now fewer senior roles. That was in part due to agencies trimming costs amid shrinking client budgets. The trend is exacerbated by mergers such as the forthcoming tie-up between Omnicom and IPG, which will create the world's largest holding company but will likely lead to job losses, industry insiders have said.\n\n\"Everyone I talk to is getting rid of people who were overpaid and hiring back at a different level,\" said Lori Murphree, founder of the ad industry M&A advisory firm Evalla Advisors.\n\nMurphree said there are some exceptions, such as the raft of independent agencies that have recently taken on private equity investment and are now bulking up.\n\nOut: Skills that AI excels at\n\nIndustry insiders are updating their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to reflect the changing times.\n\nA LinkedIn analysis found that social media management, e-commerce optimization, paid media advertising, performance marketing, and influencer marketing were among the fastest-growing skills people in the advertising and marketing industries have added to their profiles on the platform between January 2025 and January 2024.\n\n\"With nearly 40% of marketers under pressure to measure ROI in the short term, it's no surprise that they are increasingly leaning into skills like influencer marketing to build trust with their audiences and drive continued growth,\" said Tom Pepper, senior director at LinkedIn. (ROI refers to \"return on investment\".)\n\nAdvertising and marketing LinkedIn users were less likely to add established skills like \"marketing communications\" to their profiles, as well as skills like web design and email marketing, where AI is increasingly replacing human work.\n\n\"Automation continues to squeeze PR, copywriting, media owner sales, and production roles,\" said Simon Francis, CEO of Flock Associates, a marketing consultancy and search firm.\n\nAdvertising recruiters said they are searching for candidates whose career paths have taken unusual or varied turns. This can sometimes indicate that they are adaptable to the industry's ever-changing nature.\n\n\"Instead of skillsets, I consistently focus on mindset,\" said Monica Torres, executive director of global recruiting at the ad agency TBWA\\Worldwide. \"Having a mindset of curiosity and optimism, those are the traits that are always in demand because they're going to make you a problem solver for clients.\"\n\nAd execs encourage their peers to seek out unusual career paths and international roles. Tristan Fewings\n\nInternational experience can also be a bonus, industry insiders said.\n\nIndustry veteran Emiliano Gonz\u00e1lez De Pietri began his career in Madrid, Spain. He said his career and mindset got a jolt in 2013 when he moved to Peru to become deputy chief creative officer of the ad agency Circus Grey, later simply known as Grey.\n\nWhile he spoke the same language as his colleagues, he clearly didn't share the same cultural references, humor, and understanding of local consumer behavior. He made it his mission to adapt.\n\n\"Just like a student, doing at least one year abroad is going to do wonders for your worldliness and ability to be a more interesting person,\" said De Pietri, who has now returned to Madrid as a global creative partner at McCann Worldgroup, having also done stints in London and New York in between.\n\n\"You encounter entirely different business problems, situations, politics \u2014 you will become a more versatile advertising beast,\" he added.\n\nOne thing in the industry hasn't changed: the constant fight for new business. But it's not just the domain of a dedicated agency growth department. Almost everyone in senior roles is expected to have those relationships, said Sasha Martens, president of the advertising executive recruiting firm Sasha the Mensch.\n\n\"What you're seeing is a lot of creatives a lot closer to the client than they were in the past,\" Martens said. \"There's a greater understanding that you have to understand the strategic needs of your clients.\""

            "article_content": "Experiencing a Windows 11 boot loop can be incredibly frustrating, transforming your computer into a seemingly endless cycle of restarts that disrupts productivity. When your system continuously fails to load the login screen and instead repeatedly attempts to restart, you\u2019re facing a critical technical issue that demands immediate attention.\n\nThis persistent reboot problem can stem from various causes. So, what do you do? Let\u2019s look at some ways to diagnose and resolve the Windows 11 boot loop, helping you restore your computer\u2019s functionality and get back to work.\n\nWhat causes a Windows 11 PC to keep restarting?\n\nThere\u2019s no single cause for a Windows 11 PC getting stuck in a reboot loop. A reboot loop can be caused by an issue with your computer\u2019s power supply, a malware infection, overheating, or even hardware drivers. Here are the different things to check if your Windows 11 laptop or desktop keeps restarting.\n\nFix #1 \u2013 Boot your PC into safe mode\n\nWhen you are troubleshooting any problem on your PC, you should boot your computer into safe mode. If when you\u2019re PC is in safe mode it no longer experiences the restart loop, then this means that the default Windows 11 settings and drivers aren\u2019t causing the issue. This allows you to narrow down the sources of problems causing your Windows 11 PC to crash, making it easier to troubleshoot. Here\u2019s what you need to do to boot in safe mode:\n\nPress the Windows Logo key and R at the same time .\n\nkey and . Type msconfig in the box\n\nin the box Press OK\n\nUnder Boot Options, click the Safe Boot checkbox.\n\nWhen your computer restarts, it will automatically restart in safe mode. If your computer restarting is making it difficult to follow these steps, you can also follow these steps at the sign-in screen:\n\nHold the Shift key while clicking the Power icon\n\nkey while clicking the icon Select Restart\n\nYour PC will restart\n\nOnce your PC restarts, you will see a Choose option; click it\n\noption; click it Select Advanced Options\n\nSelect Startup Settings\n\nNow, when your PC restarts, you will be presented with a list of options. Select 4 or F4 to start your PC in safe mode. If you need to use the internet while the computer is in safe mode, you can select option 5 or press F5.\n\nWINDOWS 11 TIPS AND TRICKS YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW YOU NEEDED\n\nFix #2 \u2013 Remove any new software\n\nIf your automatic rebooting problem began after installing a new app, uninstall that app and monitor your PC. If you still notice your PC restarting, there\u2019s a chance that the app has infected your system settings before you uninstalled it. To fix this, you\u2019ll need to restore the system. To do a system restore, you should first boot your PC into safe mode and then follow these steps:\n\nOpen the Control Panel\n\nSearch the Control Panel for Recovery\n\nSelect Recovery\n\nChoose Open System Restore\n\nClick Next\n\nNow you will click on your hard drive, and select finish. Your computer will automatically restart.\n\nFix #3 \u2013 Make sure your computer isn\u2019t overheating\n\nAn overheating laptop or desktop will try to prevent damage to critical hardware components by shutting itself down. This is one of the leading causes of a Windows 11 PC getting stuck in a restart loop. If you\u2019ve noticed your desktop giving off a lot more heat than usual or a laptop feeling hot to the touch, chances are you have an overheating issue.\n\nA computer\u2019s CPU and GPU generate the most heat, so I recommend monitoring those hardware pieces to see if they are overheating. You don\u2019t need any additional software to monitor the temperatures of your GPU, as some temperature readings are built into Windows 11. Here\u2019s how to check on your hardware temperatures in Windows 11:\n\nOpen the Task Manager\n\nClick the second tile, Performance, on the left-hand side of your screen\n\non the left-hand side of your screen From here, you can click GPU, which will show you your GPU temperature\n\nUnfortunately, the built-in temperature reading doesn\u2019t read your CPU temperature, and you\u2019ll need to manually go into the UEFI/BIOS to check the temperature without installing any additional software. However, there\u2019s a multitude of free-to-use apps that manufacturers have developed to measure your CPU temperature, including Core Temp, HWMonitor, or Open Hardware Monitor.\n\nWhen you open one of these monitoring tools, you\u2019ll be able to view your PC\u2019s stats, including CPU and GPU temperatures and loads. If your CPU or GPU is running too hot, try cleaning the components to remove dust. For custom-built desktops, adding more exhaust fans to the case can improve airflow and cooling. Persistent overheating, especially in older laptops, may indicate that it\u2019s time to consider upgrading your machine.\n\nTAKE YOUR WINDOWS PC\u2019S SECURITY TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nFix #4 \u2013 Check for issues with your PC\u2019s power supply\n\nA computer will randomly restart when it has a failing power supply unit (PSU). If you have an issue with your power supply, you\u2019ll know if your computer won\u2019t restart or turn on. In addition to causing shut-offs and restart-loops, a faulty power supply can also cause a blue screen of death error. In severe cases, you might even smell a burning scent or witness smoke coming from your PC\u2019s power supply exhaust vent. If you use a laptop with PSU issues, you cannot send your computer to a repair shop or the manufacturer for repair.\n\nDesktop PC owners have it a bit easier, assuming they have a pre-built PC that can be altered easily. If you do have a desktop, turn off and unplug your computer before going into the case to investigate if dust build-up is affecting your PSU. If your PSU fails, you must purchase and install a new one.\n\nFix #5 \u2013 Scan your PC for viruses\n\nMalware and other viruses are a common cause of a crashing or constantly restarting PC. The easiest way to do this is by using strong antivirus software.\n\nMy top pick is TotalAV, and you can get a limited-time deal for CyberGuy readers: $19 your first year (80% off) for the TotalAV Antivirus Pro package.\n\nGet my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.\n\nIf your computer is stuck re-booting, you may need to boot into safe mode in order to run an anti-virus application. Here\u2019s what you need to do to boot your PC in safe mode with Windows 11:\n\nWhen your computer restarts, at the sign-in screen, press and hold the Shift key\n\nkey Click Power\n\nClick Restart\n\nNow, your computer should act more stable after booting in safe mode, allowing you to run an anti-virus scan.\n\n10 USEFUL WINDOWS KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nFix #6 \u2013 Disable automatic restart\n\nIf you have automatic restart enabled in Windows 11, your PC will restart every time it encounters a system failure. You can easily disable this future within the Windows 11 command prompt. Here\u2019s what you need to do:\n\nPress the Windows key + R on your keyboard\n\non your keyboard Type sysdm.cpl and click OK\n\nand click OK Select the Advanced tab\n\ntab Under Startup and Recovery, click Settings\n\nclick Under System Failure , uncheck the box Automatically restart .\n\n, uncheck the box . Click ok.\n\nKeep in mind this isn\u2019t a fix for the problem, but it will help you further troubleshoot the restart loop problem by disabling automatic restarts.\n\nFix #7 \u2013 Repair your system files\n\nAn issue with your Windows 11 system files may be causing your PC to constantly restart. If you think a corrupted system file is why your PC keeps restarting, there\u2019s a quick and easy fix you can do within the Windows Powershell. The System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool that will scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a system file has been modified, it will automatically replace the file with the correct version. Here\u2019s how to run the SFC command:\n\nOpen the Windows Powershell (or Command Prompt )\n\n(or ) Type in sfc /scannow\n\nPress Enter\n\nLeave the command prompt window open until the command completes, which could take some time.\n\nIf there\u2019s no problem with your Windows system files, after the scan, you\u2019ll see a message that says, \u201cWindows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.\u201d If you instead see a message saying, \u201cWindows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them,\u201d you should try running SFC again but in safe mode.\n\nFix #8 \u2013 Check for RAM issues in the command prompt\n\nYour PC might be restarting itself because it doesn\u2019t have access to enough Random Access Memory (RAM). Windows 11 may become unstable without enough RAM in your computer, causing the OS to randomly reboot. You can use the built-in Memory Diagnostics Tool in Windows 11 to check your computer for issues related to RAM. Here\u2019s what you need to do:\n\nPress the Windows Key and R\n\nand Type mdsched.exe in the text box\n\nin the text box Click OK\n\nSelect Restart Now and Check for Problems.\n\nWhen your PC restarts, the Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool will check for any RAM-related issues; if the test detects an error, take note of the error code. You can check the error code online to find the correct fix for that specific error.\n\nKurt\u2019s key takeaways\n\nThese are the best fixes for a computer that is constantly restarting. While you can perform these fixes at home, it might be your best bet to send your computer to a repair shop or back to the manufacturer if you continue having an issue with your Windows 11 PC being stuck in a restart loop after these fixes. It also may be time to invest in a new laptop if you are experiencing a system slowdown and random restarting on your Windows 11 PC, but I would recommend trying to fix the problem first before buying a new machine.\n\nWhat was the most challenging computer technical issue you\u2019ve ever encountered, and how did you resolve it?

            "article_content": "PM Images/Getty Images\n\nThe cloud has dominated enterprise technology provision for a decade or more. Public cloud services, with huge capacity, commitments to security, and assurances that the latest and greatest technologies are running underneath, offer a compelling value proposition. In the age of artificial intelligence (AI), capacity is critical. However, a new survey suggests evidence of a movement away from public provision.\n\nClose to seven in 10 companies (69%) have moved at least some apps off the cloud and back to on-premise systems or private clouds, the survey of 1,420 IT executives from Rackspace finds. Reasons given for this retrenchment back to on-premise environments include data security and compliance concerns, cited by 50%, better integration with existing on-premise systems, mentioned by 48%, and cost savings and budget constraints, cited by 44%.\n\nAlso: The best email hosting services: Expert tested\n\nIndustry experts and business leaders also recognized a reconsideration of the value of public clouds. For one, the rising costs of cloud subscriptions -- with accompanying sticker shock -- means many finance chiefs have paused for thought. \"Enterprises are just spending too much on public cloud services, given applications they may have migrated to the cloud years ago,\" said David Linthicum, a leading consultant, author, and former CTO with Deloitte.\n\nTechnical debt may be the root of many moves back to on-premise environments. \"Normally this is a self-inflicted thing,\" Linthicum said. \"They didn't refactor the applications to make them more efficient in running on the public cloud providers. So the public cloud providers, much like if we're pulling too much electricity off the grid, just hit them with huge bills to support the computational and storage needs of those under-optimized applications.\"\n\nRather than spending more money to optimize or refactor applications, these same enterprises put them back on-premise, said Linthicum. Security and compliance are also an issue. Enterprises \"realize that it's too expensive to remain compliant in the cloud, with data and sovereignty rules. So, they just make a decision to push it back on-premise.\"\n\nAlso: 5 reasons why Google's Trillium could transform AI and cloud computing - and 2 obstacles\n\nThe perceived high costs of cloud operations \"often stem from lift-and-shift migrations that in some cases didn't optimize applications for cloud environments,\" said Miha Kralj, global senior partner for hybrid cloud service at IBM Consulting. \"These direct transfers typically maintain existing architectures that don't leverage cloud-native capabilities, resulting in inefficient resource utilization and unexpectedly high expenses.\"\n\nHowever, the solution to this problem \"isn't necessarily repatriation to on-premises infrastructure,\" said Kralj. \"Most performance, security, and cost challenges we encounter can be addressed through cloud-native refactoring -- redesigning applications to fully utilize cloud capabilities like auto-scaling, containerization, and serverless architectures. Organizations that invest in refactoring consistently report improved operational efficiency and better cost control.\"\n\nWhen it comes to costs, \"many organizations are finding that cloud solutions can be costly, with unexpected expenses from data egress fees and premium features, among others,\" said Timothy E. Bates, professor at the University of Michigan and former CTO for Lenovo and General Motors. \"On the other hand, on-prem solutions have upfront costs, but they are more cost-effective in the long run for stable workloads.\"\n\nAlso: The best open-source AI models: All your free-to-use options explained\n\nBates witnessed the trend toward achieving a better balance between cloud and on-prem while architecting and building hybrid solutions for GM: \"Large enterprises are increasingly reevaluating the risks and limitations of relying solely on the cloud for critical workloads and intellectual property.\"\n\nEnterprises don't like being dependent upon someone else's cloud infrastructure, said Richard Robbins, founder and owner of TheTechnologyVault.com. \"Many of the enterprises that are regulated, especially banks and other financial institutions, are moving some or all of their web apps from the cloud back to on-prem or to hybrid setups,\" he observed. \"It is clear that there has been enough vulnerability and downsides to cloud hosting to make executives feel nervous about not having more control over the security and other aspects of cloud hosting.\"\n\nBates also said security, control, and cost efficiency are at the roots of such cloud hesitation: \"A cloud, while offering scalability, is a shared resource -- organizations have to trust third-party providers like Azure, Amazon, or Google with their most sensitive data. For businesses with highly proprietary information or strict compliance needs, the potential risks of not having end-to-end control over the storage of that information far exceed the benefits.\"\n\nAlso: How to easily use Cloudflare's secure DNS on your Mac and why it even matters\n\nTo a large degree, the hype around the cloud has dissipated, with many people focusing on AI instead. As a result, many decision-makers are taking a clear-eyed view of the cloud's benefits and drawbacks. \"I remember talking to CIOs and DevOps personnel in 2017 -- several of them had been assigned, to their dismay, to do whatever was needed to move their technology into the cloud,\" said Robbins. \"Most felt overwhelmed with the assignment and pushed back. That was during the cloud rush, when having apps hosted in the cloud was a status symbol and a marketing flex.\"\n\nNow, \"with the movement to the cloud being hasty and not very well coordinated, enterprises are re-thinking their initial decision to move to the cloud,\" Robbins continued. \"Companies like Dropbox, one of the first major enterprises to use the cloud, began moving back to their own hosting infrastructure as early as 2015. The benefits of their reversal -- including saving nearly $75 million in operational costs over a two-year period -- have influenced other enterprises to follow suit.\"\n\nBates said reliability and performance are also considerations that favor on-premise systems. He said applications that require low latency, and mission-critical tools or apps that deal with proprietary processes, are sometimes better run from dedicated, in-house infrastructure. \"When we built the hybrid model for GM, we got the benefits of the cloud without compromising on the security and reliability of on-prem systems,\" he said. \"This hybrid model is something that is now being adopted by more companies.\"\n\nHowever, some experts believe evidence of a movement away from the cloud is unclear, especially when vendor perspectives are involved. \"When we talk about the potential security benefits of local architecture, this is a drop in the bucket compared to larger conversations in cybersecurity at this moment,\" said Seth Geftic, vice president of product marketing at Huntress. \"Although I don't believe that people are moving away from the cloud in such high waves, there are a number of potential reasons that a company could look toward local infrastructure.\"\n\nA balancing act between on-prem and cloud will likely continue, with the need to weigh the advantages for both sides. \"Cloud providers have a huge deal of control over their resources, meaning that there is little companies can do when they decide to put up prices,\" said Geftic.\n\n\"Cloud is an expensive solution, but one that offsets that with a number of advantages -- speed, scalability, ease of use. What the industry could experience is a slight deviation from full-cloud architecture and a restructuring toward hybrid environments. A direct leap from fully cloud-based to fully local seems like a slight stretch, if I'm being honest.\"\n\n"

Oh, and they're the largest shark in history.\n\nSome fans think that the megalodon is back (Getty Stock Photo)\n\nBut some think that they could be back as a documentary about the megalodon that aired on the Discovery Channel back in 2013.\n\nIt was titled Megalodon: The Shark Lives, and after resurfacing recently on YouTube, a lot of people seem to think that the chilling footage in the video could be telling about the pre-historic creature.\n\nAdvert\n\nWith over seven million views, the video gruesomely shows a blue whale carcass that is beached off the coast of Hawaii, that looks to have been brutally attacked.\n\nOriginally filmed in 2009, the blue whale's insides can be seen hanging out after being cut open by a predator, despite being the biggest animal in the world.\n\nThis photo allegedly shows a six foot fin (Discovery Channel)\n\nA talking head the programme introduces as a marine biologist explained that the culprit had to be the size of a megalodon, as other scenes in the documentary claimed to show six foot tall fins poking out of the ocean near similar blue whale attacks, as people believed that megalodon could still be around.\n\nAdvert\n\nOne user wrote in the comments: \"Six percent of the ocean has been explored, still no sign of the megalodon, but that's only 6%. Megalodon could still be alive.\"\n\nAnother added: \"I believe in megalodon because we just explored 5% Of The Ocean... Its Lurking Down There....\"\n\nBut a third pointed out: \"Megalodon was a surface dweller, I'm sure we'd of [sic] spotted it by now.\"\n\nAnd a fourth also said about one of the scenes: \"That whale died and its guts exploded.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nGraphic images of dead whales were used in the documentary (Discovery/YouTube)\n\nBut despite all of this footage and a whole documentary suggesting that the megalodon could have returned, a brief disclaimer at the start of the show said that the potential return of the species was not based on fact.\n\nThe whole documentary was actually fake, or fiction, rather.\n\nDiscovery Channel viewers couldn't believe it when they found out that Megalodon: The Shark Lives wasn't based on any actual scientific research, but instead used edited footage to make viewers believe that megalodon could still be in our waters.\n\nAdvert\n\nAsk any respected marine biologist though, and they'll tell you that this isn't the case.\n\nShark expert David Shiffman was one person who certainly wasn't happy about the documentary, telling National Geographic it was a 'fiasco' and 'utter nonsense'."

            "article_content": "Archaeologists have unveiled a remarkable Byzantine-era complex in Israel, featuring a vibrant mosaic floor with a Greek inscription from the Bible.\n\nThe inscription, quoting Deuteronomy 28:6, reads: \u201cBlessed are you (lit: peace be with you) when you come in and blessed are you when you go out.\u201d\n\nThe discovery was made during pre-construction excavations for a new neighborhood near Kiryat Gat. The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) has identified the site as a significant Roman and Byzantine-era location, possibly a monastery.\n\nThe site, which dates back to the fifth or sixth century C.E., reveals a wealth of artifacts, including a winepress, a large warehouse, and imported goods like metal, glass containers, coins, and marble objects. Excavation managers Shira Lifshitz and Maayan Margulis told Smithsonian Magazine that the site is \u201cThe largest and most significant discovery in the region from the Roman and Byzantine periods.\u201d\n\nThe mosaic floor, located in what is believed to be the monastery\u2019s main aisle, features intricate designs of crosses, lions, doves, flowers, geometric patterns, and an amphora (an ancient jug). These artistic elements, combined with the Biblical inscription, suggest the site was of considerable importance.\n\nThe site was continuously occupied from the early Roman period (around the first century C.E.) to the late Byzantine period in the sixth century. Archaeologists believe its first human activity may date back 6,000 years to the Chalcolithic era.\n\nThis discovery sheds light on the spread of Christianity during the Byzantine Empire\u2019s golden age. Following Emperor Constantine I\u2019s conversion to Christianity in the fourth century C.E., the Byzantine Empire became a hub of religious and cultural development.\n\nThe IAA continues to work on preserving the site and its artifacts, offering invaluable insights into the history of the region."

One of the first notable sightings came in 1966 when a mysterious glowing object was seen over Wanaque.\n\nIt started on Jan. 11 when people from many other towns were among callers to police that they saw the strange object over the Wanaque reservoir.

It was described as between 2 to 9 feet with a light brighter than any star changing from white to red to green and it was reported the object moved in a manner no man-made aircraft could.\n\nWhat made this sighting so credible is the huge number of people reporting it. Even the mayor of Wanaque saw this.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon was terribly strange,\u201d Mayor Harry T. Wolfe explained.

Unearthed from the arid and discovery-rich Pisco basin, this nearly-complete Cosmopolitodus Hastalis fossil highlights the region's significant contributions to understanding prehistoric marine life.\n\nThe shark's fossilized remains, including a jaw equipped with teeth reaching up to 8.9 centimeters, are a testament to the species' dominance in ancient seas. With adults reaching lengths comparable to small boats, these marine giants had a diet chiefly composed of sardines, as evidenced by remnants found within the specimen's stomach.\n\nDuring the presentation, paleontologist Mario Urbina emphasized the rarity of complete shark fossils, enhancing the importance of this discovery. This unveiling follows previous finds in the region, including ancient river dolphin and crocodile fossils, cementing Peru's standing as a pivotal site for paleontological research.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

Hidden from the outside world for thousands of years, a unique population of crocodiles has adapted to their dark, isolated home. This article uncovers the secrets behind these fascinating creatures.\n\nDiscovery of the Cave Crocodiles\n\nIn 2008, archaeologist Richard Oslisly uncovered a population of dwarf crocodiles in the Abanda caves. These reptiles, believed to be trapped for 3,000 years, have evolved remarkable traits to survive in complete darkness. Unlike their relatives, they no longer rely on sunlight to regulate their metabolism, showcasing the incredible resilience of life.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nA comparison of crocodiles lying on their backs. (Image credit: Olivier Testa, CC BY-SA 3.0 , via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nHow Cave Crocodiles Differ from Forest Relatives\n\nCave crocodiles feed on bats and crickets rather than fish. Studies suggest they are healthier than forest-dwelling crocodiles, likely due to abundant food and a lack of predators. Genetic analysis has revealed unique traits, with some crocodiles even developing a distinct orange hue, possibly from exposure to bat guano.\n\nA young African dwarf crocodile on the cave floor. Researchers discovered that their diet consists mainly of crickets and bats. (Image credit: Olivier Testa, CC BY-SA 3.0 , via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nEvolution into a New Species\n\nThe cave crocodiles are genetically distinct from their forest counterparts. Over time, their isolation has led to the development of new traits, signalling their evolution into a separate species. Researchers believe this process may continue as the crocodiles adapt further to their unique environment.\n\nThese extraordinary crocodiles offer insight into the adaptability of life. Their continued study will reveal more about evolution's power and the mysteries hidden beneath the earth."
