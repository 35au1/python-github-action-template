        "article_content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: AARO/DOD\n\nIt's never aliens.\n\nAt least, it hasn't been yet. The United States Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities heard testimony on Tuesday (Nov. 19) from Jon T. Kosloski, director of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). The U.S. Department of Defense created the office in July 2022 in order to have a single place for military and government personnel to report UFO sightings, or UAP, as they're now known. The new term, short for unidentified anomalous phenomena, encompasses not only unidentified objects or events in the sky, but also those in water, in space or those that appear to travel between these domains.\n\nDuring today's hearing, Kosloski came in strong, stating that \"it is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has not discovered any verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology.\" Still, despite having resolved hundreds of cases with prosaic explanations, Kosloski noted that his office does not believe that every UAP is a bird, balloon or drone. \"We do have some very anomalous objects,\" he said.\n\na blurry black dot flying above a snow-covered volcano in grainy black-and-white footage\n\nKosloski also reported on the office's latest analysis of UFO/UAP cases, stressing that his office will \"continue to follow the science and data wherever they lead\" and keep both Congress and the public as informed as possible \u2014 at the unclassified level, he clarified.\n\nThat stands in stark contrast to testimony presented to a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee last week, in which a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former U.S. counterintelligence officer told lawmakers that the American government is part of a decades-long coverup to conceal the fact that \"we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nDuring his testimony, Kosloski gave an overview of his office's activities since it issued a report to Congress and testified in a similar setting last year. \"Many reports resolve to commonplace objects like birds, balloons and unmanned systems, while others lack sufficient data for comprehensive analysis,\" Kosloski said, adding that \"only a small percentage of reports received by AARO are potentially anomalous.\"\n\nKosloski referred to a UAP incident that occurred in 2013 near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. The infrared video, shot in 2013 by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol helicopter, appears to show an object flying just above the ocean before disappearing into it, or perhaps splitting in two.\n\n\"We assessed that it was actually flying over the airport the entire time,\" Kosloski said. When the object appears to disappear in the infrared video that accompanies the case, it is actually the camera sensing that the object is the same temperature as the water behind it. Instead of splitting in two, it was simply two objects \u2014 balloons or sky lanterns \u2014 in close proximity that came in and out of view.\n\nKosloski also offered how his office was able to close the case on the infamous GOFAST video, shot by a U.S. Navy fighter jet in 2016 off the coast of Florida. In that case, the object's apparent speed in the video was actually due to the parallax effect, or the camera's perspective, Kosloski explained.\n\nFurthermore, the AARO director showed a 2018 video captured by a drone flying over Mt. Etna that he stated is not widely known among the public. \"This was a rather difficult case to solve,\" Kosloski said. \"The object was actually 170 meters away from the plume \u2014 not flying through it.\"\n\nDuring questioning, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) asked Kosloski about whether or not some individuals who have encountered UAP might be reluctant to engage with his office, referring to accusations some UAP disclosure advocates frequently level against AARO. These critics attest that the office is part of an alleged decades-long U.S. government-led campaign of \"excessive secrecy\" that aims to keep the public in the dark about UFOs.\n\nIn response to Gillibrand's questioning, Kosloski defended his office. \"Congress has gone out of its way to create the organization AARO specifically to conduct these sorts of investigations, and has uniquely empowered them to have access to all UAP related information, whether that's historic or current, and we take that responsibility and those authorities very seriously,\" he said.\n\nGillibrand also asked about a report released by AARO in March 2024, noting that she has been told \"it doesn't show any any evidence of secret programs that have aliens.\"\n\nBut Gillibrand pushed back on that assertion. \"That's not how I read the report,\" the senator said. \"What I read in the report is the US government took sightings extremely seriously over the last 75 years, and put some of the greatest minds together to analyze these cases, because they assessed them as some deeply unknown phenomena that may or may not cause threats \u2014 that may or may not be related to adversaries.\"\n\na grainy black orb above the ocean in a black-and-white video\n\nAARO released a report to accompany today's hearing earlier this week. The report, titled, \"All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office\u2019s Annual Report on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena,\" examines UAP cases dated between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024 as well as historical incidents that were not included in previous reports.\n\nBut, like in its other reports, AARO found no smoking gun for alien visitation this year. \"AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,\" the report notes. Out of the 485 cases that are well within the report's timeframe, 118 were solved and another 174 were slated to be closed, pending a final review.\n\nStill, AARO's 2024 report says that many cases remain unsolved, and that the office continues to study them. However, AARO\u2019s ability to resolve cases \"remains constrained by a lack of timely and actionable sensor data,\" according to the report, meaning there just isn't enough data to conclusively solve cases that lack detailed or multi-sensor observations. In some cases, all there might be to analyze is a single photograph, a few seconds of grainy video or an aviator's written report. Many UAP sightings happen in the blink of an eye as an unknown object zooms past a moving aircraft, for example, so there often isn't enough time to gather photographic or video evidence.\n\nIn other cases, the capabilities of the sensors or platforms involved in the UAP sightings are themselves classified (sometimes, even their existence isn't publicly known), so AARO is unable to discuss them in unclassified reports.\n\nThough overall, according to the 2024 report, there is enough data for AARO to state that it has has \"no indication or confirmation that these activities are attributable to foreign adversaries.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n\u2014 Pentagon UFO office finds 'no empirical evidence' for alien technology in new report\n\n\u2014 Pentagon has 'no credible evidence' of aliens or UFOs that defy physics\n\n\u2014 UFO whistleblowers tell Congress 'we are not alone in the cosmos' (video)\n\nToday's hearing echoed a previous hearing held last year on April 19, 2023. During that hearing, AARO's previous director Sean Kirkpatrick told the Senate Armed Services Committee that his office has seen \"no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity, off-world technology or objects that defy the known laws of physics.\"\n\nSimilarly, the report released by AARO in March 2024 that examined historical UFO cases found \"no evidence that any USG [U.S. government] investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.\"\n\nAARO's previous report, released in 2022, examined 510 contemporary UAP reports gathered from government agencies and branches of the United States military. The report found that, while most cases were able to be resolved, 171 remained a mystery.\n\n\"Some of these uncharacterized UAP appear to have demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities, and require further analysis,\" AARO's 2022 report states.\n\nToday's hearing concluded with a discussion of recent incidents in which unidentified drones, or uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), were seen over U.S. military bases and other sensitive installations. Those incidents, Kosloski notes, underscore the need for the United States to have \"more persistent monitoring and understand that, whether it is a UAP or a counter-UAS issue, that we need to have that complete domain awareness around our national security facilities.\""

It focuses on filmmakers who have yet to direct a second feature in the years following the release of their promising independent feature debut. It provides a living and work space at the Silver Sun Residence and culminates with a week in New York City this month. During her time in residence, Godfrey Peoples will continue developing the script for her next project and participate in curated meetings with industry professionals facilitated by Neon and UFO. This program will also engage the local community through a screening of \u201cMiss Juneteenth\u201d at Upstate Films\u2019 Orpheum Theater in Saugerties, N.Y.\n\nGodfrey Peoples was honored by the National Board of Review with the Best Directorial Debut Award for \u201cMiss Juneteenth.\u201d The film received both Independent Spirit and Gotham Awards nominations, winning a Best Actress Gotham for lead actor Nicole Beharie. The film follows a former beauty queen and single mom as she prepares her rebellious teenage daughter for the \u201cMiss Juneteenth\u201d pageant.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cAll of UFO\u2019s filmmaker support programs are made possible through meaningful partnerships, and we are proud to be partnering with Neon. Neon\u2019s extensive industry expertise and their unparalleled eye for bold artistic promise in both films and filmmakers has been an invaluable asset in developing this program,\u201d Martha Gregory, UFO\u2019s co-director, said in a statement. \u201cWe love Channing\u2019s work and we are delighted to welcome her to New York for this residency.\u201d\n\nGodfrey Peoples was selected through an invite-only application process. In collaboration with Neon, UFO identified filmmakers whose first feature films exhibited creative risk-taking. Their curation focused on filmmakers from historically underrepresented experiences and backgrounds who had not yet had a second feature project greenlit at the time of selection.\n\nNeon recently released \u201cAnora,\u201d which won the Palme d\u2019Or in Cannes, and the hit horror film \u201cLonglegs.\u201d UFO is a donor-supported organization that gives time, space and money to filmmakers at under-resourced career stages."

        "article_content": "H, the Paris startup founded by Google alums, made a big splash last summer when, out of the blue, it announced a seed round of $220 million before releasing a single product. Three months later, still without a product, that splash started to look like a catastrophic flood when three of the company\u2019s five co-founders left over \u201coperational and business disagreements.\u201d\n\nBut the company has kept swimming, and today it\u2019s announcing its first product: Runner H, an \u201cagentic\u201d AI aimed at businesses and developers across tasks like quality assurance and process automation. It's built atop the startup\u2019s own, proprietary \u201ccompact\u201d LLM based on just 2 billion parameters.\n\nH has set up a waitlist for Runner H on its site. CEO Charles Kantor said that it will be releasing APIs to those on the list over the coming days to use agents \u201coff the shelf\u201d that have been pre-built by H, as well as for developers to create their own. Access to the API will also come along with access to something called H-Studio to test and manage how these services work.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nInitially, using those APIs will be free, and later there will be a payment model introduced.\n\nEven using compact LLMs, building and running AI is not cheap, especially as competition continues to raise money to develop their own products. TechCrunch has also confirmed that H is raising a Series A to build what Kantor describes as part of the second era of AI \u2014 with LLM companies like OpenAI being part of the first era.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky to be in the position of building our own models,\u201d Kantor said. \u201cBut this second era will be as capital intensive as first one.\u201d\n\n(Recall the $230 million H has already raised \u2014 it appears to have added another $10 million since announcing it earlier this year \u2014 was a mixture of equity and convertible debt. The long list of investors in that round included individuals like Eric Schmidt, Yuri Milner and Xavier Niel; VCs such as Accel and Creandum; and strategic backers like Amazon, Samsung and UiPath.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nKantor told TechCrunch that H has quietly been working with a handful of customers in areas like e-commerce, banking, insurance and outsourcing, who have been helping it hone the product.\n\n\u201cEverything [in H] is not based on our creativity but customer feedback,\u201d he said.\n\nRunner H will initially focus on three specific use cases: robotic process automation (RPA), quality assurance, and business process outsourcing.\n\nRPA is an area that has existed for years, using basic scripts to automate the most repetitive tasks that humans have had to perform \u2014 such as reading forms, checking boxes, and sending files from one place to another. In fact, a lot of RPA has never been built with AI baked in, even after AI started to develop advanced skills. The idea with Runner H is that it will be able to run RPA across forms, sites, and other templates even when they have been modified (something that might have broken previous scripts), and across a much wider range of sources.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nQuality assurance can cover a wide range of applications, but Kantor said that one of the most popular so far has been reducing the \u201cmaintenance burdens\u201d around website testing \u2014 validating page availability, simulating real user actions, or ensuring compatibility across payment methods \u2014 in particular when modifications have been made.\n\nBPO is a catch-all area that will cover not just fixing and improving billing processes, but also speeding up how an agent can use and access data from different sources, and more.\n\nThere has been a race among foundational AI companies around how many parameters are going into LLMs. (GPT 4 for example has 175 billion parameters.) But Runner H is taking a very different approach with just 2 billion parameters, both for its LLM and for its computer-vision based \u201cVLM.\u201d Kantor\u2019s argument is that this makes them significantly more efficient in terms of cost and operations, key when working on winning and keeping business deals, and H\u2019s own operational costs.\n\n\u201cWe are specialists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are building for the agentic era.\u201d\n\nThe company also claims that it works: it says that its compact models outperforms Anthropic\u2019s \u201cComputer Use\u201d by 29% (based on WebVoyager benchmarks) as well as models from Mistral and Meta."

These more complex AI applications will require more thought, more code, more testing, and more safeguards.\n\nAn AI evolution requires a similar evolution in our development tools. Although we\u2019ve seen Power Platform\u2019s Copilot Studio begin to deliver tools for building task-focused agents, more complex AI applications will require a lot more work, even with support from frameworks like Semantic Kernel.\n\nMuch of Azure\u2019s current AI tools, beyond its Cognitive Services APIs, are focused on building grounded chatbots, using Microsoft\u2019s Prompt Flow framework to add external vector indexes to LLMs for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), along with wrapping calls and outputs in its own AI safety tools. It\u2019s a proven approach to building and running Microsoft\u2019s own Copilot services, but if enterprises are to get the next generation of AI services, they need new tools that can help deliver custom agents."

Its profile, called @Nvidia_AI_PC, is dedicated to RTX AI PCs and seems to be promoting AI for the average user. Its bio says, \u201cNvidia Powers the World\u2019s AI. And Yours with RTX AI PCs,\u201d and the first pinned post says, \u201cWhether you are deep into AI or just a little curious, we\u2019re here to explore the power of AI on your local PC.\u201d\n\nThe social media profile will deliver the latest news, tech, and AI inspiration from Team Green, with the aim of promoting AI tech on consumer devices. This is particularly important as it seems that most users still haven\u2019t figured out AI, with the majority buying an AI PC not because of its AI capabilities but because it\u2019s the only available option in 2024. And although Nvidia is the leading manufacturer of AI tech in the data center and enterprise world, it probably faces its fiercest competition in the consumer space, with Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and even Apple all producing processors with built-in NPUs.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe company has previously criticized AI PCs, saying that their performance is only good for basic AI workloads and that its GPUs offer better performance, achieving 100 to more than 1,300 TOPS, depending on the model. Furthermore, we\u2019ve been hearing news and rumors that Nvidia will soon launch an Arm-based processor in 2025, which was further fueled when the heads of Nvidia, TSMC, MediaTek, and Quanta were spotted having dinner before Computex 2024. Although it\u2019s easy to brush off this event as just industry leaders enjoying some time off, it could also be a cap to an informal agreement where Nvidia produces consumer AI CPUs, especially as these four companies are what you need to produce a laptop from scratch.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s no secret that Nvidia wants to enter the CPU market. It even attempted to buy Arm, the company behind the architecture of Snapdragon X and Apple M chips. Unfortunately, the deal was shot down by several government regulators, including the U.S.\u2019s FTC and the U.K.\u2019s CMA. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Masayoshi Son, the head of SoftBank, the investment group that owns 90% of Arm, regret that they both did not take the opportunity to merge the two companies about a decade ago.\n\nThe company\u2019s move to launch the Nvidia AI PC account Twitter/X is one more sign that the company is trying to emulate its success in data center AI in the consumer space. If and when Nvidia launches its own AI CPU, it would add one more competitor in the processor market \u2014 a space that\u2019s increasingly becoming crowded with Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple all jostling for a bigger slice of the pie."

Mantzarlis, who stumbled on one of these accounts while casually using Instagram, said he started researching the AI-generated influencer accounts because it might show us where AI-generated content is taking social media and the internet more broadly, where he sees a \u201ca rising blended unreality.\u201d Mantzarlis believes he could have easily found 900 more accounts and that the only reason he didn\u2019t get more is that Instagram restricted the account he used to scrape the platform.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a possible sign of what social media is going to look like in five years,\u201d Mantzarlis said in an interview. \u201cBecause this may be coming to other parts of the internet, not just the attractive-people niche on Instagram. This is probably a sign that it's going to be pretty bad.\u201d\n\nThe Accounts\n\nOut of more than 1,000 AI-generated Instagram influencer accounts we reviewed, 100 included at least some deepfake content which took existing videos, usually from models and adult entertainment performers, and replaced their face with an AI-generated face to make those videos seem like new, original content consistent with the other AI-generated images and videos shared by the AI-generated influencer. The other 900 accounts shared images that in some cases were trained on real photographs and in some cases made to look like celebrities, but were entirely AI-generated, not edited photographs or videos.\n\nOut of those 100 accounts that shared deepfake or face-swapped videos, 60 self-identify as being AI-generated, writing in their bios that they are a \u201cvirtual model & influencer\u201d or stating \u201call photos crafted with AI and apps.\u201d The other 40 do not include any disclaimer stating that they are AI-generated.\n\nOne of the bigger accounts in the latter category is \u201cChloe Johnson,\u201d who has a verified account on Instagram and 171,000 followers. This account was deleted by Meta within the past few weeks."

        "article_content": "There's not been a game that nails the feeling of loneliness like Stalker 2. A vast and challenging open world sci-fi RPG from GSC Game World, it stands alone in its ambitious exploration of a perilous, ruined landscape plagued by greed and unflinching peril. A theme park to some and a fresh hell for others, Stalker 2 excellently portrays the grim reality of trying to carve a life out of struggle, wrestling with the weird and the paranormal.\n\nIt is a shame the game was impaired by bugs during my playthrough, though perhaps there is no better indicator of its status as a legitimate successor to the Stalker mantle than crashes, busted side quests, and broken notes left unreadable due to some technical spaghettification.\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nThe game places you in the shoes of Skif, a man whose home is destroyed due to a sudden appearance of anomalous shenanigans outside the boundaries of The Zone. This spurs him to enter The Zone alone, to try and take back his future like so many Stalkers before him, and maybe discover why this tragic accident happened in the first place.\n\nOver the next 40 hours (at least) he'll find himself at the centre of potentially world-changing events, delving headfirst into The Zone's mysteries, and drinking approximately 25 energy drinks-per-hour without exhibiting any health problems whatsoever. Maybe proximity to The Zone makes us all a little anomalous, right?\n\nThe Stalker series has earned a reputation for its difficulty, and in Stalker 2 this manifests in two forms: one I like, one I don't. The first is a practice of resource management and risk-taking. The Zone is littered with ample ammunition, bread, grenades, more bread, delicious energy drinks, precious healing items, and more bread. If you're like me you'll start the game grabbing everything, a practice Stalker 2 will beat out of you.\n\nIt's surprisingly easy to find yourself overencumbered. What do you mean I'm holding 6KG of sausage? How could this ammo I'm not using be this heavy? What do you mean it's my fault I have 50 bandages in my bags?\n\nDelicious canned meat! | Image credit: VG247\n\nSo, naturally, you slay your inner loot goblin and grab only what you need, and cut down on the bread in the hopes of a low-carb life with a fast move speed and uncluttered backpack. But then you run into an area and are confronted with a Chimera, or a Psi-dog, or three Bloodsuckers. Suddenly you're burning through ammo, you're out of good healing items, and the taste of bread is naught but a sweet memory. If only I had looted more bread!\n\nWhat this does is force you to prepare, to take things slow. Sure, you can run and gun through The Zone, dashing into anomalies while your podcast is blaring and throwing healing items away, but you're punished for it. Stalker 2 is a game of slow, gradual wins. Clearing the map, building up a wealth of spare goodies in your stash, building a nice nest egg of Coupons for a raining day, and heading out prepared. I even walked back five minutes into town when I realised I was under-stocked once. Me? Retreating from a challenge? A testament to the game's artisanally-crafted difficulty, clearly.\n\nBuddy please move I need to get to my stash. | Image credit: VG247\n\nThere are, however, spikes. Quite naughty ones at that. You may know what a Psuedogiant is, but what you're not familiar with is a Chimera. These bullet sponge, two-headed, leaping monsters have a tendency to pop up at the worst times, are faster than you, and have a seemingly infinite aggro range.\n\nYou must fight them if you see them, and while there is no shame in jumping on top of a box and blasting away all your ammo, they can (and will) combo you from 100% health to zero. I shall not spoil the events leading up to the worst one, but if you see a train tunnel after a main mission, brace yourself. There is one especially tricky fight that I believe leans over to the frustrating side of things, but it's story-related, so I'd rather die than spoil it for you.\n\nWhat a wonderful segue... The main narrative in Stalker 2 is fantastic. Filled with intriguing twists and turns, revelations, thrilling action, and believe-it-or-not some stellar character performances. As per the iron-clad conditions of this review set out by the publisher, I can't point to any one narrative moment that stole the show, but I wouldn't anyway since I was taken aback by various moments in the story.\n\nCharacters I assumed were one-dimensional genuinely flipped my expectations on their head. You'll sit up and prepare yourself for a show whenever the gameplay transitions into in-game cinematics.\n\nThe story is, also, quite long. Reviewers were told by the developers upon receiving a code that the main story alone takes 30-40 hours, to which I was sceptical. I believed that this number surely took into account a healthy serving of exploration. I was totally wrong. At around the 15 hour mark, I had only explored three of the regions. The next 15 hours was spent entirely focused on the main story with little to no exploration. This is a game you can gorge on.\n\nThis decision, within the game's first five hours, does have an impact later on! | Image credit: VG247\n\nOn this note, I'd absolutely recommend not focusing just on the story. You'll miss out on cool side quests dotted around the map, cool gear, and tons of artefacts. Not to mention, certain side quests will become uncompletable at certain points in the story. So, once you enter a region, totally finish up and quests there before moving on for the best experience. There's an RPG locked behind a door and I don't know how to open it. Devastating.\n\nOne final note on the narrative; I was giddy when it became clear to me that story decisions I made actually mattered. I'm not talking about some final cinematic changes as a lone sign of your deeds, I'm talking forks in the story that diverge pleasantly. Quest items you can only get by siding with a faction, that makes certain things easier. Main characters noting your allegiances.\n\nI sided with The Ward - the game's military police that stand philosophically, and sometimes literally, opposed to native factions in The Zone - and riding that cop train as far as it goes was ripe with merit and interesting moments. The Stalker series has taught folks that things aren't always black and white, and Stalker 2 maintains that legacy elegantly.\n\nShout out to emissions, which are beautiful and very bad for your health! | Image credit: VG247\n\nAnother reason to explore is the world of Stalker 2 itself, which is gorgeous in both looks and vibe. Some may disagree with me here: they may find themselves bored of trees and green hills. But look beyond the general landscape of The Zone and you'll find a rich landscape dotted with haunting ruins, a legacy of civilisation overcome by both metaphysical incursions and the conquest of time.\n\nEven in the initial region, The Lesser Zone, places like The Poppy Field, The Ribs, and the Bulba stand in stark contrast to the regular. Later on, places like The Swamp and the Red Forest show the extent of how The Zone can morph and transform the world, for better and worse.\n\nI'm also in love with the settlements. These aren't just ramshackle towns, but sometimes sprawling homes for The Zone's population, each with their own style and character. People live in old factories, ruined ships, and tunnels. Some live in squalor while others reside in clean structures with sick bars and (gasp) working elevators. I, personally, made my den in a settlement in the Chemical Plant because I'm a bougie boy who loves the fictional cops, but I can't deny my heart longs for the best bar in the game, just a little trip north.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that the world building is strong, be it environmental storytelling throughout the various landmarks, the rad Ukrainian music playing on the radio, or the little moments of respite you find along the way. I sat down by a fire with a random Stalker in The Lesser Zone. He wasn't an important NPC or anything, he was just a guy, and we became close friends in a matter of seconds. Then, a pack of dogs spawned and mauled him to death moments later. I looted some sausage off his body and moved on, distraught and utterly sold on the whole tone from there on out.\n\nRest in peace, mate. | Image credit: VG247\n\nThis all might sound as glowing as background radiation poisoning, and it is, but the game is not without its problems. I opened the article with a reference to the game's bugs, and I did encounter a fair number, ranging from funny distractions, to crashes, to disastrous quest-halting schisms.\n\nMany of the smaller bugs have been fixed in the days leading up to launch: dead bodies flying skyward and pulling cartwheels before vanishing on the horizon, gunfire sounds on your weapons vanishing completely when you stop using your personal PDA. Some remain though, like allied NPCs standing in doorways during fights, unmoving and rooted like an oak tree regardless of how often you push against them. And the act of killing them failing quests forever. Uh oh.\n\nI didn't run into any serious crashes until 25 hours in, though there was a spot in The Lesser Zone that lagged heavily that has now been fixed (from what I can tell). This crash happened when I opened the map during an 'emission' - a map-wide event that forces you inside or has you face certain death. Not only did I have to close the game via the task manager, I had to restart my PC completely. The autosave file in that spot then could not be loaded without an instant crash.\n\nThose smaller bugs, while grating, aren't the biggest deal in the world, and required only a loaded save to circumvent. However, later in the game I ran into some really bad ones. There is a side quest that I won't spoil, but it involves defending a settlement. One NPC asks you to take out some enemies nearby, and this guy is essentially an AOE soft lock. It doesn't matter if you help him, ignore him, or even let him die! No matter what happens, the game locks you into a dialogue you must Alt F4 out of.\n\nThis meant I had to ignore the side quest altogether, which had horrendous ramifications for the region. This bug was reported, so I can only hope it's fixed. If it's not, it's a real sore spot on the game.\n\nNow, Stalker is no stranger to bugs, and what I can say is that there have been waves of bug fixes during the review period that have removed a lot of the smaller problems. On top of that, a Day Zero patch went into effect a day prior to this review's publication. I've jumped in and noticed an impact, sure, but at the same time I can't review a version of the game I've not seen.\n\nThe floating lads and flying bodies have a certain charm. | Image credit: VG247\n\nWhat I would recommend for players is to take your time going through the game, as these quickfire fixes do point to a collective effort to patch things up, and there's hope that by the time you reach some of my rough moments it'll be working as intended.\n\nIf not, the Stalker series has a rich history of community-led mods that fix multitudes of problems. If bugs are a real prohibiting factor for you, keep tabs on the community's experience in the coming days and maybe hang back for a week or two.\n\nIn spite of these problems, I loved my time with Stalker 2. It says a lot that even with a bug that would otherwise push me away from a game like this, I continued playing - perhaps a little bummed out, yeah, but still eager to see more.\n\nIt's a game created under extraordinarily shitty circumstances, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine forcing much of the staff to leave the country while their peers either stuck it out among their family or signed up the war effort.\n\nMaking games is hard, regardless, and the fact that the team was able to put together a package like this that's so earnest, so passionate in its revisit of a world enshrined in PC gaming's history, is more than impressive. It's an admirable feat that I hope isn't lost on the general gaming crowd who don't know too much about the games outside of their time playing them.\n\nI would recommend Stalker 2 to fans of the Stalker series, obviously, and as anyone with a love of open world FPS games and distinct sci-fi. The good thing is it's available on Game Pass, so you can pay less than full price and try it out.\n\nNow, if you don't mind, I've got three loaves of bread to eat and about a dozen energy drinks waiting for me.\n\nThis review is based on a PC build of Stalker 2, with code provided by GSC Game World."

Pic: AP\n\nHe was popular, though his promotion of alternative medicine, faith healing and various paranormal beliefs earned him criticism from a number of medical publications and physicians.\n\nThe critics accused him of blurring the lines between medical advice and advertising, failing to make clear to his audience just how closely he worked with the companies he pitched.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 11:20 Who will be in Trump's White House?\n\nDespite the controversy, Dr Oz's show was a hit and his net worth sat between $100m (\u00a379m) and $315m (\u00a3249m) in 2022, according to a federal financial disclosure he filed that year.\n\nBeyond being an Emmy-winning TV show host, he is also an author of New York Times bestsellers, radio talk show host, founder of a national nonprofit to educate teens about healthy habits, and self-styled ambassador for wellness.\n\nHe was also a regular Fox News commentator, and a champion of unproven treatments for COVID including hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug whose use against the disease was also backed by Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage: Dr Oz holding his Emmy for outstanding talk show host in 2016. Pic: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP\n\nHe became a fierce critic of Joe Biden's government during the COVID pandemic, challenging its policies on social media.\n\nMoving into politics\n\nDr Oz played a lesser part in the first Trump administration from 2016, when he was appointed to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition.\n\nBut it was in 2022, after his show concluded, when Dr Oz really transitioned into politics by running for US Senate as a Republican in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe campaign leaned heavily into his celebrity status, with his campaign logo almost identical to his TV show logo.\n\nImage: Mehmet Oz campaigning for Senate in 2022. Pic: AP\n\nDuring his campaign rallies, he would talk up his \"number one health show in the world,\" give the odd piece of medical advice to supporters and spend a lengthy amount of time signing autographs and posing for photos.\n\nFollowing a court battle that went all the way to the US Supreme Court, Dr Oz narrowly won the primary over Dave McCormick by 951 votes, becoming the Republican candidate, but lost to Democrat John Fetterman in the general election.\n\nHis relationship with Trump\n\nImage: Donald Trump stands behind Dr Oz during rally in 2022. Pic: Reuters\n\nThe surgeon has had a long, personal relationship with the president-elect spanning back to the early 2000s.\n\nHe said in an interview during his Senate campaign that the pair first met in 2004 or 2005, when Dr Oz asked Mr Trump to use his golf course for an event for his children's charity.\n\nMr Trump agreed and, after that, they saw each other intermittently at social events before Dr Oz interviewed him about his health during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMr Trump appeared on his show, where he also said his wife Melania was \"a big fan\" of the doctor.\n\nThe pair then worked together when Mr Trump won the election and put Dr Oz on the President's Council.\n\nThen in 2022, Mr Trump was integral to Dr Oz's push for Senate, giving him his eagerly sought-after endorsement.\n\nRead more:\n\nWho does Trump want in his top team?\n\nTrump and Musk watch shaky rocket launch\n\n\"Women, in particular, are drawn to Dr Oz for his advice and counsel. I have seen this many times over the years. They know him, believe in him, and trust him,\" Mr Trump said when he first backed him.\n\n\"You know when you're in television for 18 years, that's like a poll,\" added the billionaire, who himself starred on 14 seasons of The Apprentice US.\n\n\"That means people like you.\"\n\nWhat will his role be?\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate to take the role, Dr Oz would oversee Medicare, Medicaid, children's health insurance and the Affordable Care Act, better known as \"Obamacare\".\n\nThe programmes cover more than 160 million people, from new-borns to nursing home residents.\n\nCMS also plays a central role in the nation's $4.5trn health care economy, setting payment rates for hospitals, doctors, labs and other service providers.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\n\"Dr Oz will be a leader in incentivising disease prevention, so we get the best results in the world for every dollar we spend on healthcare in our great country,\" the president-elect said in a statement.\n\n\"He will also cut waste and fraud within our country's most expensive government agency, which is a third of our nation's healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire national budget.\"\n\nDr Oz said he was \"honoured\" to be nominated for the role and looked forward to \"serving my country to Make America Healthy Again\".\n\nHe, like all of Mr Trump's picks, must be questioned by members of the Senate before it votes on his appointment. Even with the Republicans in control, some of the picks could be blocked."

We might call this second approach the \u201cwobble\u201d method. The gravity of a planet tugs its star one way, then another, as the orbiting planet makes its way around the star. And that wobble can be detected by changes in the light from the star, picked up by specialized instruments on Earth. Such \u201cradial velocity\u201d measurements of this planet reveal that its mass, or heft, amounts to no more than about a third of our own Jupiter. But the transit data shows the planet\u2019s diameter is about the same. That means the planet has a comparatively low density and, likely, an inflated atmosphere. So this world probably is not a gas giant like Jupiter. Instead, it could well be a planet whose atmosphere will shrink over time. When it finally settles down, it could become a gaseous \u201cmini-Neptune\u201d or even a rocky \u201csuper-Earth.\u201d These are the two most common planet types in our galaxy \u2013 despite the fact that neither type can be found in our solar system."

It's been standing for more than a century.\n\n\n\nThe Atlas Science Center, formerly the Paper Discovery Center, is closing due to high costs and is now for sale at $1.8 million\n\nWhile the museum portion is up for sale, spaces like Mondo on the River remain under separate ownership and will stay operational\n\nThe building holds historical significance, having once been a major paper mill in the Appleton area\n\n(The following is a transcription of the full broadcast story)\n\nThe Atlas Science Center, once home to the Paper Discovery Center, is up for sale at $1.8 million.\n\nThe science center operated for nearly 20 years, promoting learning, discovery, and exploration. However, earlier this month, it announced closure due to rising operational costs.\n\nThe building has a long history, originally serving as a paper mill. While part of the space is for sale, other areas, like \u201cMondo on the River,\u201d remain under separate ownership.\n\n\u201cThe science center portion is wholly owned by the science center. They are completely separate to me and the other businesses on the two floors above me,\u201d said David Oliver, owner of the restaurant Mondo on the River.\n\nOliver assured customers his restaurant isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\n\u201cThis side of the building? Not for sale. This is going to remain in the hands of the owner of this side of the building for many, many years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe building also holds personal significance for many in the community.\n\n\u201cFor myself and my family, it was the mill that my father worked at for many, many decades,\u201d said Sheila Brucks of the Appleton Historical Society.\n\nShe added, \u201cThe history along the Fox River is so important. It\u2019s important for us to look back on that history and know why we are here.\u201d\n\nNBC 26 has reached out to the museum board, but they have yet to comment on what could be next for the space."

        "article_content": "Starting a business is exciting, but let\u2019s be honest\u2014it\u2019s also expensive. From hiring developers to setting up systems, costs can quickly add up, leaving little room for experimentation. But here\u2019s the good news: no-code tools are rewriting the rules of entrepreneurship. They allow you to build apps, automate processes, and test ideas without breaking the bank.\n\nYou no longer need to rely on expensive developers or wait months to bring your vision to life. No-code strategies empower you to create and grow your business while keeping costs low. In this article, I\u2019ll share how you can leverage no-code tools to cut startup costs, streamline operations, and make every dollar count.\n\nWhy Cutting Costs Matters for Startups\n\nEvery startup faces the challenge of doing more with less. When you\u2019re just starting out, funds are often limited, and you need to allocate them wisely. Cutting costs isn\u2019t just about saving money\u2014it\u2019s about giving your business room to grow without unnecessary financial stress.\n\nWith no-code tools, you can avoid hiring full development teams, reduce software expenses, and speed up your go-to-market strategy. Imagine being able to build a functioning product or automate a workflow in days rather than months, all at a fraction of the cost.\n\n1. Use No-Code Tools to Build Your MVP\n\nYour Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the first version of your product, designed to test your idea with real users. Traditionally, building an MVP required a team of developers and thousands of dollars. No-code tools have changed the game.\n\nPlatforms like Bubble, Webflow, and Glide let you build fully functional apps and websites without any coding knowledge. You can design, test, and launch your product in weeks instead of months, saving significant development costs.\n\nExample:\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to launch an ecommerce store. Using Webflow, you can create a visually stunning and functional website without hiring a web developer. Need a mobile app for your store? Tools like Glide or Adalo make it possible.\n\nCheck out this no code tools directory to explore platforms that fit your needs.\n\n2. Automate Repetitive Tasks to Save Time and Money\n\nRepetitive tasks like sending follow-up emails, updating spreadsheets, or managing customer support can eat up your time. Hiring people to handle these tasks can also strain your budget. No-code automation tools like Zapier and Make (formerly Integromat) help you streamline these processes.\n\nFor instance, you can automate:\n\nSending a welcome email to new subscribers.\n\nAdding leads from forms to your CRM.\n\nUpdating inventory levels across platforms.\n\nAutomation not only saves money but also frees up your time to focus on scaling your business. You don\u2019t have to manage everything manually when these tools work in the background.\n\n3. Create Marketing Assets Without Hiring Designers\n\nProfessional design services can be expensive, especially for startups on a budget. No-code tools like Canva and Visme let you create stunning graphics, social media posts, and presentations without needing a designer. These platforms offer templates and drag-and-drop interfaces that make designing simple.\n\nExample:\n\nIf you\u2019re promoting your business on Instagram, Canva allows you to create eye-catching posts and stories that stand out. With no additional cost, you can maintain a professional online presence and attract more customers.\n\nFor entrepreneurs exploring best side business ideas for entrepreneurs, using design tools like Canva can also help build your brand with minimal investment.\n\n4. Streamline Customer Management with No-Code CRM Tools\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) is crucial for any business, but traditional CRM software can be expensive. No-code CRMs like Airtable and Notion allow you to manage your customer data, track interactions, and even automate follow-ups\u2014all on a budget.\n\nHow to Use No-Code CRMs:\n\nTrack sales leads and conversations in Airtable.\n\nUse Notion to create a centralized hub for client details and project updates.\n\nAutomate lead assignment and notifications with Zapier integrations.\n\nThese tools give you the functionality of big-name CRMs without the hefty price tag.\n\n5. Test and Scale Business Ideas Without High Costs\n\nOne of the biggest challenges entrepreneurs face is testing business ideas quickly without wasting money. With no-code tools, you can experiment with different ideas and pivot when needed, all without draining your budget.\n\nFor example:\n\nBuild a prototype of your app using Bubble.\n\nSet up a landing page to validate your idea with Webflow.\n\nUse Glide to create a mobile app for testing a new service.\n\nNo-code tools give you the flexibility to adapt your business strategy based on feedback. This agility can save you from costly mistakes and help you focus on what works.\n\n6. Reduce Software Expenses with Free and Low-Cost No-Code Tools\n\nInstead of investing in multiple expensive tools, you can use no-code platforms that offer free or low-cost plans. Many tools provide all the functionality you need at an affordable price, especially when you\u2019re just starting out.\n\nTool Purpose Starting Price Bubble App development $25/month Zapier Workflow automation Free (limited) Canva Graphic design Free (with pro options) Airtable CRM and databases Free\n\nBy choosing the right tools, you can reduce overhead while maintaining the quality and efficiency of your operations.\n\n7. Work with No-Code Agencies for Complex Projects\n\nWhile no-code tools empower you to build on your own, there are times when you might need expert guidance, especially for more complex projects. A Zeroqode is top No code Agency that can help you bring your ideas to life faster and more efficiently than traditional development teams.\n\nFor instance, if you want to create a custom app with advanced functionality, a no-code agency can save you time and money by delivering a professional solution tailored to your needs.\n\n8. Leverage Free Online Resources and Communities\n\nOne of the hidden benefits of no-code tools is the thriving communities that surround them. Platforms like Bubble and Webflow have active forums where users share tips, templates, and solutions. These resources can help you learn faster and troubleshoot without spending extra money.\n\nPro Tip: Many no-code tools also offer free tutorials and courses to help you get started. Use these resources to build your skills and avoid costly mistakes.\n\nConclusion\n\nStarting a business doesn\u2019t have to drain your savings. By using no-code tools, you can build, automate, and grow your startup while keeping costs low. From creating an MVP to managing customers and streamlining workflows, no-code strategies let you focus on expanding your business without financial stress.\n\nWith no-code tools, you can turn your entrepreneurial dreams into reality without spending a fortune."

        "article_content": "Apple does not assist third parties in unlocking iPhones, which has led many law enforcement agencies to rely on the Graykey forensics tool. A recent report from 404 Media indicates that this controversial product can now access the newest iPhone 16 models.\n\nShould this be a concern for you? Almost certainly not, but it\u2019s still good to stay informed about how these things work. Here\u2019s a quick overview.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nA new report states that Graykey can access \u201cpartial\u201d information from iPhones running iOS 18 or iOS 18.0.1, including the iPhone 16 lineup. What \u201cpartial\u201d information means is unknown. Leaked documents also suggest that iPhones with the iOS 18.1 beta are inaccessible to Graykey. The same restriction is believed to apply to the official release of iOS 18.1, which became available to the public in late October.\n\nGraykey, like another law enforcement-used unlocking product, Cellebrite, is very secretive about how its products help unlock iPhones. What we do know, however, is that these companies look for new iPhone vulnerabilities to do their job. As Apple patches security flaws, companies have to find new ways to access data, and so on.\n\nSince at least iOS 12 in 2018, Apple has continually identified vulnerabilities that make iPhones susceptible to unlocking and subsequently released software patches that address the issue. Eventually, third parties find new vulnerabilities, and so on.\n\nAs 404 Media indicates, Magnet Forensics, which owns Graykey, could eventually find ways to unlock iOS 18, iOS 18.1, and subsequent versions. Apple developers are currently testing iOS 18.2, which should be released to everyone before the end of the year. The leaked documents don\u2019t mention this version.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that products like Graykey and Cellebrite need physical access to a device to function \u2014 if they can at all. This isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll run into in the wild and cannot be done remotely.\n\nUser privacy has always been one of Apple\u2019s core principles. As a result, its products, such as the iPhone and iPad, are protected by strong encryption. The company has consistently resisted government requests to create a \u201cbackdoor\u201d for data access.\n\nFor individuals concerned about unauthorized access to their phones, ensuring they have installed the latest software updates is the best course of action. For iPhones, this means updating to iOS 18.1.1; for iPads, the update is iPadOS 18.1.1."
