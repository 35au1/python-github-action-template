        "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 An annual report released Wednesday by the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence revealed hundreds of cases of unidentified anomalous phenomena. But even with the sightings, there is still no direct link to aliens.\n\nOf the 757 reports, 485 occurred between May 2023 and June 2024, while around 272 occurred between 2021 and 2022.\n\nAccording to the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), 21 of the cases still remain under investigation and require further data and analysis.\n\n\"It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,\" the report stated. \"None of the reports AARO received during the reporting period indicated that observers suffered any adverse health effects.\"\n\nMost of the sightings turned out to be balloons, birds, aircraft and even satellites in outer space.\n\nHow Thunderstorms Hundreds Of Miles Away Can Wreak Havoc On Air Travel\n\n\"AARO increasingly receives cases that it is able to resolve to the Starlink satellite constellation,\" the report stated. \"For example, a commercial pilot reported white flashing lights in the night sky. The pilot did not report an altitude or speed, and no data or imagery was recorded. AARO assessed that this sighting of flashing lights correlated with a Starlink satellite launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the same evening about one hour prior to the sighting. This sighting occurred in the known orbital path of the satellites. AARO is investigating if other unresolved cases may be attributed to the expansion of the Starlink and other mega-constellations in low earth orbit.\"\n\nWhile the number of reported UAP incidents has risen in recent years, government officials contend it is because of the public\u2019s greater awareness and tendency to report such objects than actually a growing trend.\n\nThe AARO was established in 2022 to oversee the investigation and analysis of UAPs and help determine their threats to national security.\n\nOf the nearly 400 reports received from pilots during the period, only one incident appeared to pose a potential safety risk, in which the AARO continues to look into the case.\n\nAdditionally, 18 reported events occurred near U.S. nuclear infrastructure, weapons and launch sites, prompting the involvement of law enforcement.\n\nAviation Experts Concerned 5G Rollout Near Airports Could Compromise Safety\n\nGovernment agencies, including the Department of Defense and the National Intelligence Program, use the broader term of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) rather than Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) to identify cases.\n\nUAPs include any unexplained phenomenon that occurs on land, sea or space, while UFOs specifically refer to objects that fly through the sky.\n\nRecent spotting of an UFO reported to the Department of Defense.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: Hundreds of UFO-like sightings revealed in US Department of Defense report"

The sightings are then investigated by multiple agencies.\n\nOnce the Pentagon puts together the report, it\u2019s sent to the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office for review.\n\nThis year, the AARO received 757 new incident reports, 485 from this past year and an additional 272 from 2021-2022 that were not sent. The Pentagon says after being reviewed, the majority of the sightings were found to be ordinary objects.\n\nAs of today, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has received over 1,600 UAP reports, 757 of which came to AARO during the period covered by this report. \u201cAARO has successfully resolved hundreds of cases in its holdings to commonplace objects such as balloons, birds, drones, satellites and aircraft,\u201d said Sabrina Singh, the Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary.\n\nDuring that press briefing, the head of the AARO acknowledged that there were 21 reports over the last year and a half that he can\u2019t explain. The agency added that all 21 happened near national security sites, were recorded on video, and had multiple eyewitnesses.\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Accountability recently held its second hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs, as they call them."

        "article_content": "Newly released documents have revealed that Canadian police collected debris of a UFO that was shot down over Lake Huron last year.\n\nThe object was taken down on February 12, 2023 by a US F-16 fighter jet, marking the third such incident over North America that month.\n\nWitnesses described the object as 'octagonal' with strings hanging off it before the jet fired two missiles, striking the UFO that then slowly descended into Canadian waters.\n\nDocuments obtained by CTVNews.ca stated that 'wreckage' was found on 'the shoreline of Lake Huron' weeks after search efforts were suspended.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) partnered with the American and Canadian Coast Guard to conduct a brief search following the incident.\n\nBy February 16, it was called off due to 'deteriorating weather and the low probability of recovery, according to an RCMP statement.\n\nBut the partially redacted emails acquired by CTVNews.ca revealed that the RCMP collected 'both material and a module' from the site of the incident roughly three weeks after the object was shot down.\n\nNational security officials have criticized the effort for a 'lack of transparency.'\n\nNewly released documents have revealed that Canadian police collected debris after an unidentified object was shot down over Lake Huron on February 12 2023\n\n'The module is from a company who sells weather monitoring equipment,' a senior RCMP member told a Canadian military brigadier-general in an email sent on March 13, 2023, according to CTVNews.ca.\n\n'It will be analyzed to determine if there is anything unusual with it but I suspect not given the size. Whether or not it is from the shoot down is uncertain,' the email continued.\n\nAn RCMP spokesperson further confirmed the debris collection in a statement to CTVNews.ca.\n\n'The RCMP confirms that debris was recovered from the shores of Lake Huron, and we continue to work in close collaboration with our domestic and international partners in furthering the investigation,' the spokesperson said Friday.\n\n'As the investigation is ongoing, additional details cannot be provided at this time.'\n\nThe RCMP would not confirm whether the debris was ever definitively linked to the Lake Huron object, and Canada's Department of National Defense also declined to comment, CTVNews.ca reported.\n\nIain Boyd, director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado Boulder, said that the lack of transparency could be because the US and Canadian governments were embarrassed of shooting down objects that did not pose national security threats.\n\nThe object was taken down by a US F-16 fighter jet, and was the third unidentified object to be shot out of the sky over North American that month\n\nThe incident occurred just days after the downing of a Chinese surveillance balloon on February 4, which garnered widespread media attention.\n\n'To have expended significant military time and resources to shoot down benign objects does not look good, even though there may have been many factors we are still unaware of,' he speculated to CTVNews.ca.\n\n'I am not surprised that the Canadian government did not share more information about the Lake Huron debris.'\n\nThe incident, and three others that month, occurred just days after the downing of a Chinese surveillance balloon on February 4, which garnered widespread media attention.\n\nThe other two were downed in Alaska and Yukon, Canada.\n\nAll three were reported to be smaller than the Chinese balloon, which measured 200 feet tall, according to US General Glen D. VanHerck.\n\nThe balloon carried an underslung payload described as a 'technology bay' that was roughly the size of two to three school buses.\n\nIt flew across North America from January 28 to February 4, 2023, passing over Alaska, western Canada and the contiguous US before it was shot down by the US Air Force off the coast of South Carolina.\n\nAnalysis of the debris determined that the balloon carried intelligence-gathering equipment, but it did not appear to have sent information back to China.\n\nThe three UFO incidents that followed did not appear to be related to the Chinese balloon, and there was no evidence to suggest that they were surveillance vehicles from any other country, President Joe Biden stated on February 16."

        "article_content": "The European Union\u2019s risk-based rulebook for artificial intelligence \u2014 aka the EU AI Act \u2014 has been years in the making. But expect to hear a lot more about the regulation in the coming months (and years) as key compliance deadlines kick in. Meanwhile, read on for an overview of the law and its aims.\n\nSo what is the EU trying to achieve? Dial back the clock to April 2021, when the Commission published the original proposal and lawmakers were framing it as a law to bolster the bloc\u2019s ability to innovate in AI by fostering trust among citizens. The framework would ensure AI technologies remained \u201chuman-centered\u201d while also giving businesses clear rules to work their machine learning magic, the EU suggested.\n\nIncreasing adoption of automation across industry and society certainly has the potential to supercharge productivity in various domains. But it also poses risks of fast-scaling harms if outputs are poor and/or where AI intersects with individual rights and fails to respect them.\n\nThe bloc\u2019s goal for the AI Act is therefore to drive uptake of AI and grow a local AI ecosystem by setting conditions that are intended to shrink the risks that things could go horribly wrong. Lawmakers think that having guardrails in place will boost citizens\u2019 trust in and uptake of AI.\n\nThis ecosystem-fostering-through-trust idea was fairly uncontroversial back in the early part of the decade, when the law was being discussed and drafted. Objections were raised in some quarters, though, that it was simply too early to be regulating AI and that European innovation and competitiveness could suffer.\n\nFew would likely say it\u2019s too early now, of course, given how the technology has exploded into mainstream consciousness thanks to the boom in generative AI tools. But there are still objections that the law sandbags the prospects of homegrown AI entrepreneurs, despite the inclusion of support measures like regulatory sandboxes.\n\nEven so, the big debate for many lawmakers is now around how to regulate AI, and with the AI Act the EU has set its course. The next years are all about the bloc executing on the plan.\n\nWhat does the AI Act require?\n\nMost uses of AI are not regulated under the AI Act at all, as they fall out of scope of the risk-based rules. (It\u2019s also worth noting that military uses of AI are entirely out of scope as national security is a member-state, rather than EU-level, legal competence.)\n\nFor in-scope uses of AI, the Act\u2019s risk-based approach sets up a hierarchy where a handful of potential use cases (e.g., \u201charmful subliminal, manipulative and deceptive techniques\u201d or \u201cunacceptable social scoring\u201d) are framed as carrying \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d and are therefore banned. However, the list of banned uses is replete with exceptions, meaning even the law\u2019s small number of prohibitions carry plenty of caveats.\n\nFor example, a ban on law enforcement using real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces is not the blanket ban some parliamentarians and many civil society groups had pushed for, with exceptions allowing its use for certain crimes.\n\nThe next tier down from unacceptable risk/banned use is \u201chigh-risk\u201d use cases \u2014 such as AI apps used for critical infrastructure; law enforcement; education and vocational training; healthcare; and more \u2014 where app makers must conduct conformity assessments prior to market deployment, and on an ongoing basis (such as when they make substantial updates to models).\n\nThis means the developer must be able to demonstrate that they are meeting the law\u2019s requirements in areas such as data quality, documentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy, cybersecurity, and robustness. They must put in place quality and risk-management systems so they can demonstrate compliance if an enforcement authority comes knocking to do an audit.\n\nHigh-risk systems that are deployed by public bodies must also be registered in a public EU database.\n\nThere is also a third, \u201cmedium-risk\u201d category, which applies transparency obligations to AI systems, such as chatbots or other tools that can be used to produce synthetic media. Here the concern is they could be used to manipulate people, so this type of tech requires that users are informed they are interacting with or viewing content produced by AI.\n\nAll other uses of AI are automatically considered low/minimal risk and aren\u2019t regulated. This means that, for example, stuff like using AI to sort and recommend social media content or target advertising doesn\u2019t have any obligations under these rules. But the bloc encourages all AI developers to voluntarily follow best practices for boosting user trust.\n\nThis set of tiered risk-based rules make up the bulk of the AI Act. But there are also some dedicated requirements for the multifaceted models that underpin generative AI technologies \u2014 which the AI Act refers to as \u201cgeneral purpose AI\u201d models (or GPAIs).\n\nThis subset of AI technologies, which the industry sometimes calls \u201cfoundational models,\u201d typically sits upstream of many apps that implement artificial intelligence. Developers are tapping into APIs from the GPAIs to deploy these models\u2019 capabilities into their own software, often fine-tuned for a specific use case to add value. All of which is to say that GPAIs have quickly gained a powerful position in the market, with the potential to influence AI outcomes at a large scale.\n\nGenAI has entered the chat \u2026\n\nThe rise of GenAI reshaped more than just the conversation around the EU\u2019s AI Act; it led to changes to the rulebook itself as the bloc\u2019s lengthy legislative process coincided with the hype around GenAI tools like ChatGPT. Lawmakers in the European parliament seized their chance to respond.\n\nMEPs proposed adding additional rules for GPAIs \u2014 that is, the models that underlie GenAI tools. These, in turn, sharpened tech industry attention on what the EU was doing with the law, leading to some fierce lobbying for a carve-out for GPAIs.\n\nFrench AI firm Mistral was one of the loudest voices, arguing that rules on model makers would hold back Europe\u2019s ability to compete against AI giants from the U.S. and China. OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman also chipped in, suggesting, in a side remark to journalists that it might pull its tech out of Europe if laws proved too onerous, before hurriedly falling back to traditional flesh-pressing (lobbying) of regional powerbrokers after the EU called him out on this clumsy threat.\n\nAltman getting a crash course in European diplomacy has been one of the more visible side effects of the AI Act.\n\nThe upshot of all this noise was a white-knuckle ride to get the legislative process wrapped. It took months and a marathon final negotiating session between the European parliament, Council, and Commission to push the file over the line last year. The political agreement was clinched in December 2023, paving the way for adoption of the final text in May 2024.\n\nThe EU has trumpeted the AI Act as a \u201cglobal first.\u201d But being first in this cutting-edge tech context means there\u2019s still a lot of detail to be worked out, such as setting the specific standards in which the law will apply and producing detailed compliance guidance (Codes of Practice) in order for the oversight and ecosystem-building regime the Act envisages to function.\n\nSo, as far as assessing its success, the law remains a work in progress \u2014 and will be for a long time.\n\nFor GPAIs, the AI Act continues the risk-based approach, with (only) lighter requirements for most of these models.\n\nFor commercial GPAIs, this means transparency rules (including technical documentation requirements and disclosures around the use of copyrighted material used to train models). These provisions are intended to help downstream developers with their own AI Act compliance.\n\nThere\u2019s also a second tier \u2014 for the most powerful (and potentially risky) GPAIs \u2014 where the Act dials up obligations on model makers by requiring proactive risk assessment and risk mitigation for GPAIs with \u201csystemic risk.\u201d\n\nHere the EU is concerned about very powerful AI models that might pose risks to human life, for example, or even risks that tech makers lose control over continued development of self-improving AIs.\n\nLawmakers elected to rely on compute threshold for model training as a classifier for this systemic risk tier. GPAIs will fall into this bracket based on the cumulative amount of compute used for their training being measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) of greater than 1025.\n\nSo far no models are thought to be in scope, but of course that could change as GenAI continues to develop.\n\nThere is also some leeway for AI safety experts involved in oversight of the AI Act to flag concerns about systemic risks that may arise elsewhere. (For more on the governance structure the bloc has devised for the AI Act \u2014 including the various roles of the AI Office \u2014 see our earlier report.)\n\nMistral et al.\u2019s lobbying did result in a watering down of the rules for GPAIs, with lighter requirements on open source providers for example (lucky Mistral!). R&D also got a carve out, meaning GPAIs that have not yet been commercialized fall out of scope of the Act entirely, without even transparency requirements applying.\n\nA long march toward compliance\n\nThe AI Act officially entered into force across the EU on August 1, 2024. That date essentially fired a starting gun as deadlines for complying with different components are set to hit at different intervals from early next year until around the middle of 2027.\n\nSome of the main compliance deadlines are six months in from entry into force, when rules on prohibited use cases kick in; nine months in when Codes of Practice start to apply; 12 months in for transparency and governance requirements; 24 months for other AI requirements, including obligations for some high-risk systems; and 36 months for other high-risk systems.\n\nPart of the reason for this staggered approach to legal provisions is about giving companies enough time to get their operations in order. But even more than that, it\u2019s clear that time is needed for regulators to work out what compliance looks like in this cutting-edge context.\n\nAt the time of writing, the bloc is busy formulating guidance for various aspects of the law ahead of these deadlines, such as Codes of Practice for makers of GPAIs. The EU is also consulting on the law\u2019s definition of \u201cAI systems\u201d (i.e., which software will be in scope or out) and clarifications related to banned uses of AI.\n\nThe full picture of what the AI Act will mean for in-scope companies is still being shaded in and fleshed out. But key details are expected to be locked down in the coming months and into the first half of next year.\n\nOne more thing to consider: As a consequence of the pace of development in the AI field, what\u2019s required to stay on the right side of the law will likely continue to shift as these technologies (and their associated risks) continue evolving, too. So this is one rulebook that may well need to remain a living document.\n\nAI rules enforcement\n\nOversight of GPAIs is centralized at EU level, with the AI Office playing a key role. Penalties the Commission can reach for to enforce these rules can reach up to 3% of model makers\u2019 global turnover.\n\nElsewhere, enforcement of the Act\u2019s rules for AI systems is decentralized, meaning it will be down to member state-level authorities (plural, as there may be more than one oversight body designated) to assess and investigate compliance issues for the bulk of AI apps. How workable this structure will be remains to be seen.\n\nOn paper, penalties can reach up to 7% of global turnover (or \u20ac35 million, whichever is greater) for breaches of banned uses. Violations of other AI obligations can be sanctioned with fines of up to 3% of global turnover, or up to 1.5% for providing incorrect information to regulators. So there\u2019s a sliding scale of sanctions enforcement authorities can reach for."

        "article_content": "Science is the systematic study of the world around us. It involves observation, questioning, understanding, and gathering evidence to make conclusions. Science isn't a subject to be learnt but a way of understanding the world.\n\nTherefore, science education must focus on developing a scientific mindset and capabilities, not merely imparting facts. Today, science education is likened to acquiring facts and figures about already discovered knowledge.\n\nadvertisement\n\nStudents are conditioned to view science as a collection of information rather than an active, exploratory process.\n\nTo change this perspective, it is crucial to reimagine the traditional science classroom as a space for exploration, experimentation, and collaboration students actively engage with science as a process of discovery.\n\nThis shift not only enriches their learning experience but also contributes to the broader goals of fostering scientific advancement that is sustainable and beneficial to humanity at large.\n\nFOCUS ON THE PROCESS OF SCIENCE\n\nFocusing on teaching the results of scientific discoveries-such as facts, principles, and applications-while neglecting the process through which these discoveries were made, the learning experience remains incomplete.\n\nThe scientific process-observing, hypothesising, experimenting and validating conclusions-is just as necessary as the knowledge gained. This requires a focus on how to \"do science\". Students must learn to base their conclusions on evidence and remain open to new ideas, just as scientists do.\n\nCOMPETENCY-CENTRIC LEARNING AND ACTIVE LEARNING PEDAGOGIES\n\nScience education should focus on developing competencies leading to abilities like problem-solving, critical thinking, and investigative skills. These abilities are best nurtured through experiential learning and inquiry-based pedagogy, where students actively engage in hands-on exploration rather than passively receiving information.\n\nFrom a young age, students should be encouraged to investigate and explore, with the practice of \"doing\" science driving their learning. This approach supports cognitive development and also cultivates a lifelong habit of inquiry and discovery.\n\nCOMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION\n\nEffective communication is crucial for meaningful science education. Without the ability to express ideas, share findings, and engage in discussions, students miss out on opportunities to deepen their understanding and refine their thinking.\n\nCurrently, science communication in many classrooms is confined to students providing predetermined answers to existing questions, which limits opportunities for collaborative learning.\n\nTo truly enhance the learning experience, students should be encouraged to communicate openly with one another, exchange insights, and collaborate on scientific explorations. Peer learning reinforces key concepts and also sparks new ideas and perspectives.\n\nBy cultivating an environment that values communication and collaboration, we can create a classroom culture where students are more engaged, motivated, and empowered to take an active role in their learning.\n\nINTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO LEARNING\n\nScience in the initial stages of learning has to be presented holistically rather than deepening the boundaries of conveniences created, like physics, chemistry, and biology, among others. An interdisciplinary approach is essential to help students appreciate the beauty and interconnectedness of nature that might otherwise go unnoticed and evolve holistic solutions.\n\nINTEGRATING TECHNOLOGY AND HANDS-ON LEARNING\n\nLeveraging modern technology, students now have access to tools that allow them to visualise and experience scientific concepts in ways that would be impossible through traditional methods. Technology empowers students to learn based on their observations and experiences, fostering a more personalised approach to education. Through a combination of technology, hands-on tools, and real-world applications, learning experiences can be curated to make learning more relevant and meaningful.\n\nSCIENCE LEARNING SPACES\n\nScience classrooms should be reimagined as spaces that encourage students to be active learners rather than just passive recipients of information. Instead of merely verifying facts through traditional experiments, students should be inspired to experiment and engage in hands-on activities that enable exploration.\n\nTraditional verification-based experiments, which require students to reproduce known outcomes, limit their potential for true discovery and creative thinking. To help students gain a better understanding of science, educators should encourage exploration, allowing students to investigate concepts and make their own discoveries.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile research-grade equipment may not be essential, students should have access to materials that allow them to understand scientific concepts at their developmental level, ensuring that learning is both relevant and engaging.\n\nBy making exploration a core component of the learning process, teachers can ignite a lifelong passion for discovery and equip students with the skills to think critically and innovate.\n\nFACILITATING LEARNING, NOT TEACHING\n\nIn this age, where access to information is not a barrier, educators should be trained as facilitators to foster building competencies in students rather than passing on information to them. Encouraging the process of exploration, curating experiences to enhance curiosity and leverage skills in the students, and enabling the process of discovery are essential.\n\nIn a rapidly evolving global learning landscape, the need for transformation in education is more urgent than ever. It is imperative that we make a concerted effort to embrace these changes, ensuring that our educational systems remain relevant, effective, and aligned with the future needs of learners.\n\nOnly through concerted efforts can we bring about a change that will equip future generations to thrive in a dynamic world.\n\nArticle by Vallish Herur, Managing Trustee, Prayoga"

When underwater cinematographer Manu San Felix first saw the mega coral, he thought it was a shipwreck due to its large size.\n\n\u201cWell, when you are in the water and you have the opportunity to see, it\u2019s evident because it's enormous. And I remember the first time I saw it was like in the first second realized that I was looking to something unique because it's huge,'' he said.\n\nThe team\u2019s coral expert, Eric Brown, said that the discovery is a reminder of the importance of coral reefs and the increased need for action to save the world\u2019s oceans.\n\n\u201cNow the significance of finding coral like this, you know, goes beyond simply, you know, enjoying the moment and seeing this magnificent organism that's mega coral, because it doesn't just captivate the hearts and minds of people like seeing something magical, but it really shines a light (on) the significance of coral reefs worldwide, what their critical role is in the ecosystem,'' he said. \u2014 Reuters"

        "article_content": "Scaling a startup is one of the most exciting yet challenging phases for any entrepreneur. The key to successful scaling lies in the ability to manage growth efficiently while maintaining product quality and meeting market demands. This is where IT outsourcing comes into play. By partnering with a reliable IT staffing agency, startups can leverage external expertise, optimize their resources, and focus on what they do best\u2014innovating and driving the business forward.\n\nThe journey of scaling a startup is full of potential pitfalls, from limited resources to the need for specialized talent that can adapt quickly to changing demands. Entrepreneurs who understand the strategic value of outsourcing can sidestep these challenges, turning potential obstacles into opportunities for growth. With the right approach, outsourcing can be the secret weapon that propels your startup to new heights and sets the stage for long-term success.\n\nWhy IT Outsourcing is a Game-Changer for Startups\n\nIT outsourcing allows startups to access a global pool of talent without the time-consuming and costly process of building an in-house team from scratch. This is particularly beneficial for tech startups that need specialized skills but may not have the budget or time to recruit and train full-time employees.\n\nOutsourcing helps startups:\n\nScale Quickly : With an outsourcing partner, businesses can ramp up their teams as needed without lengthy onboarding processes.\n\n: With an outsourcing partner, businesses can ramp up their teams as needed without lengthy onboarding processes. Access Niche Expertise : Outsourcing provides access to specialized knowledge in areas like cybersecurity, software development, and data analysis that may be hard to find locally.\n\n: Outsourcing provides access to specialized knowledge in areas like cybersecurity, software development, and data analysis that may be hard to find locally. Control Costs: Hiring in-house employees comes with fixed costs such as salaries, benefits, and office space. Outsourcing allows startups to pay for services as needed, providing more budget flexibility.\n\nThese benefits are why outsourcing has become a fundamental strategy for startups aiming to scale sustainably and competitively.\n\nKey Areas Where IT Outsourcing Can Support Growth\n\nOutsourcing can provide a significant boost across various operational areas. One of the primary areas is software development, where outsourced development teams can accelerate the software lifecycle and bring products to market faster. Startups benefit from having expert developers on hand who are already familiar with cutting-edge technologies and best practices, thus reducing the learning curve and speeding up development timelines.\n\nAnother area where IT outsourcing shines is in IT infrastructure management. By outsourcing the management of IT systems, startups can ensure their platforms are reliable, secure, and scalable without needing an in-house IT department. This allows founders and internal teams to concentrate on core business strategies and market expansion.\n\nArea of Support Benefits for Startups Software Development Faster development cycles and expert input IT Infrastructure Management Reliable, secure systems with minimal downtime Cybersecurity Enhanced protection and risk mitigation\n\nLeveraging Outsourcing to Stay Competitive\n\nOne overlooked advantage of outsourcing is the ability to stay competitive in rapidly changing markets. By outsourcing certain functions, startups can respond faster to industry trends and integrate new technologies without needing to build that expertise from scratch. This agility can be the difference between a company that thrives and one that struggles to keep up with competitors.\n\nIn addition, outsourcing partners often bring fresh perspectives and innovative solutions. Working with external teams can lead to creative problem-solving approaches that may not have been considered by an internal team. This influx of new ideas is invaluable for startups that are looking to push the envelope and distinguish themselves in their field.\n\nBest Practices for Effective IT Outsourcing\n\nTo fully reap the benefits of IT outsourcing, startups need to approach it strategically. It\u2019s not just about delegating tasks but building a partnership that aligns with business goals. Choosing the right partner is crucial\u2014select an agency with a proven track record, strong client feedback, and expertise in your industry. Setting clear, measurable objectives ensures that your partner understands your expectations and can align their efforts accordingly.\n\nMaintaining open communication is also key. Utilize effective tools like Slack, Zoom, and project management software to foster transparency and regular updates. These practices help in nurturing a strong, productive relationship with your outsourcing partner.\n\nConclusion: Position Your Startup for Growth with IT Outsourcing\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced tech landscape, startups that leverage IT outsourcing can gain a competitive advantage by scaling efficiently, accessing specialized expertise, and controlling costs. Whether it\u2019s software development, IT infrastructure, or cybersecurity, outsourcing offers a scalable solution that supports rapid growth and sustainability.\n\nReady to scale your startup to the next level?

        "article_content": "You may or may not know this, but certain online retailers and various small brands will actually increase prices before a huge sale, like early Black Friday sales, actual Black Friday, or even Cyber Monday and Cyber Week. Let\u2019s say, for example, they discount the product by $20. Weeks before, they might raise the price by $30 to make the discount look bigger. So, the reality is you\u2019re not actually getting a great deal \u2014 they trick you. There is a way to combat this and find the best early Black Friday deals and beyond. There\u2019s a tool I use called CamelCamelCamel, which works wonders to help you find the real deals and steals. Well, anyway, I used the tool to find the best deal prices for Black Friday, and the holiday discounts. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of those deals. Spoiler: They\u2019re so, so good.\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max \u2014 now $33, was $60 45% off\n\nIt makes a lot of sense that Amazon\u2019s devices would be discounted heavily for Black Friday and the holiday sales, so no surprise here. But if you\u2019ve been wanting to upgrade your streaming game you can\u2019t go wrong with the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max.\n\nDewalt 20V Max Cordless Drill and Impact Driver \u2014 now $129, was $239 46%off\n\nWe\u2019ve covered this drill set a lot in the past because, well, I have it. I also love it. It\u2019s great for just about anything drill-related. I use it to hang pictures, and TVs, and build various things around the home \u2013 my most recent project was building a wooden box around a TV on my outdoor patio. It worked wonderfully. Anyway, it comes with a regular electric drill and a hammer drill, the latter of which makes it so much easier to punch through hard materials like stone or concrete. This deal is one of the best in a while.\n\n27-inch Sceptre IPS 2K Gaming Monitor \u2014 now $169, was $200 16% off\n\nNeed a new gaming monitor or just want an extra one? You can\u2019t go wrong here. It\u2019s 27 inches, supports 2K QHD resolutions \u2014 2560 by 1440 \u2014 with HDR400, and at 165Hz with a 1ms response time. If you don\u2019t know any of those numbers, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a decent monitor, even more so at the current deal price.\n\nSony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones \u2014 now $198, was $348 43% off\n\nThe Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones earned a full five stars from our audio reviewer back when they launched. They\u2019re still that good. This deal price makes them super enticing, especially if you don\u2019t have a comparable pair handy. They\u2019re comfortable, offer excellent sound quality, offer great noise cancelation features, and include a bunch of extras. At least check them out.\n\nGarmin Vivoactive 5 Smartwatch \u2014 now $200, was $300 33% off\n\nWe gave the Garmin Vivoactive 5 four stars in our review and for good reason. It offers exceptional fitness and health tracking, long-lasting and reliable battery life, doesn\u2019t require any needless subscriptions, and has a beautiful AMOLED display. Garmin\u2019s software can be a little trick for new users, but once you get the hang of it, you\u2019re all set. Don\u2019t let that scare you away from his incredible fitness and health-oriented smartwatch. Garmin makes some of the best out there on the market today and this one is no exception. Plus, you know, that\u2019s a great deal price.\n\nNintendo Switch OLED with White Joy-Cons \u2014 now $349, was $350 1% off\n\nThis is actually less than a 1% discount which will probably lead many of you to ask why I even included it. The answer is that it\u2019s still the best price out there right now, even by a small margin. If you have Amazon gift cards or some money saved up, you can save quite a bit on it. Maybe you earned some money doing Amazon tasks or surveys? Bam, then the best place to buy is Amazon already and now you\u2019ll save even more.\n\nMSI Claw Ultra 7-155H PC gaming handheld \u2014 now $471, was $749 37% off\n\nLook, the MSI Claw isn\u2019t the best gaming handheld on the market right now \u2014 that\u2019s fairly evident. But this deal price does put it on our radar. Instead of the usual AMD chipset like the Steam Deck and its competitors, the MSI Claw opts for an Intel Ultra 7-155H, with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, a 512TB solid-state drive, a microSD card reader, and a 7-inch FHD 120Hz display. Then there\u2019s that snazzy RGB around the joysticks. I don\u2019t know, think about it.\n\n65-inch LG C3 Series Class OLED evo 4K smart TV \u2014 now $1,297, was $1,500 14% off\n\nYou know as well as I do that during these huge sales there are TV deals and discounts flying all over the damn place. It\u2019s difficult to keep up at times, that\u2019s for sure. But this LG smart TV deal is one of the best out there right now according to sources. It\u2019s a 4K OLED with a sweet spot size \u2014 65-inches \u2014 making it suitable to place in bedrooms, game rooms, garages, living rooms, you name it. The deal price doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\n2024 Apple MacBook Air 15-inch with M3 \u2014 now $1,299, was $1,499 13% off\n\nAt one of its lowest prices in a long while, this Apple MacBook Air features 16GB of unified memory, a 512GB solid-state drive for storage, and the Apple M3 chip. It\u2019s lean, mean, and one of the most powerful MacBooks released. The portable design lends itself well to creatives, with 18 hours of battery life on a single charge despite having a beautiful 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display. This is a great deal, folks."
