Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. Shellenberger will join Elizabeth Vargas Reports at 5p/4C to recap today\u2019s hearing. Find out how to watch at JoinNN.com.\n\n(NewsNation) \u2014 At a House of Representatives committee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena Wednesday, lawmakers are hearing from a number of witnesses about what they have seen and heard about UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d opened with Rep. Nancy Mace, R- S.C., laying out the goals including finding out the extent of Pentagon programs investigating UAPs and any information that may have been recovered, including any information or lack thereof on alien life or technology of non-human origin.\n\nMace noted a lack of trust in agencies including the Defense Department due to a reluctance by those entities to declassify information.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to investigate these phenomena, we must do so with the mind of protecting our country, advancing scientific discovery and upholding the trust of the American people, who right now I don\u2019t think have trust, which is obvious. I don\u2019t have trust,\u201d said Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisc.\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., also addressed the stigma around the subject, pointing to a lack of official information that pushed UFOs and UAPs to the fringes.\n\n\u201cA void of information has allowed conspiracy theories to fester,\u201d Moskowitz said.\n\nWitnesses decry culture of secrecy around UFOs\n\nRetired Navy Rear Adm. Timothy Gallaudet said in his opening statement that he first became aware of UAPs during his career as a meteorologist with the Navy and pushed back against secrecy about UAPs.\n\n\u201cWe should boldly face this new reality and learn from it,\u201d Gallaudet said.\n\nHe also said he felt a moral obligation to come forward and vouch for the credibility of whistleblowers who have come forward with their UAP experiences, many of whom have faced ridicule for their claims.\n\nPentagon insider Luis Elizondo accused a small group of government insiders of keeping the truth about UAPs from the public.\n\n\u201cExcessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public, all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked directly if the government has secret UAP craft retrieval programs, Elizondo gave an unequivocal yes but declined to answer if he had been read into such programs in a public setting.\n\nFormer NASA administrator Michael Gold pushed back against stigma about UAPs, noting that it discourages scientific efforts to determine what is happening.\n\nWhat have we learned about UAPs?\n\nLuis Elizondo, a former Pentagon insider, veteran and investigator; retired Navy Rear Adm. Timothy Gallaudet; journalist Michael Shellenberger and Michael Gold, a former NASA administrator, are scheduled to give their testimony.\n\nThis hearing is the first since the summer of 2023, which was sparked by career intelligence official David Grusch\u2018s allegations that the Pentagon has been operating a secret UFO retrieval program.\n\n\u201cIf the UFO hearings catch on with the public, we could be in for quite a ride,\u201d Bryce Zabel, UFO author and cohost of the podcast \u201cNeed to Know\u201d with Ross Coulthart, told NewsNation. \u201cBack in 1973, all of America was riveted to the Senate Watergate hearings, and the cover-up Nixon orchestrated will seem small compared to the one that would have been necessary to hide the truth about alien contact for nearly eight decades now.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re gonna learn some things\u2019 about UFOs: Rep. Tim Burchett\n\nElizondo\u2019s book \u201cImminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt for UFOs\u201d alleges that the United States military has been running a UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program for years, even recovering nonhuman specimens.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: UAP are real. Advanced technologies not made by our Government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe,\u201d Elizondo will say, according to testimony published the day before the hearing.\n\nHe will talk about what actions the government should be taking regarding the UAP issue.\n\nGallaudet, in his testimony, plans to repeat a claim he\u2019s made before to NewsNation: that an email that contained what is known as the \u201cGo Fast\u201d video, disappeared from his and his colleagues\u2019 email servers. \u201cGo Fast\u201d shows a fighter pilot\u2019s encounter with a UAP.\n\nWhat is Immaculate Constellation?\n\nShellenberger will detail his reporting on the alleged \u201cImmaculate Constellation\u201d secret government program. A whistleblower revealed the alleged UFO program, in which the Pentagon collects and quarantines information on UFO sightings, Shellenberger says.\n\nDepartment of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough has previously denied records of the program.\n\nThe \u2018tic tac\u2019 incident: What we know about the UFO encounter\n\nShellenberger will highlight the need for Congress and the White House to address UFOs.\n\nMichael Gold, a former NASA administrator, will outline new ways for NASA to be helpful on the UAP issue. Currently Chief Growth Office at Redwire Space, Gold stresses in his testimony that he is speaking on his own behalf, and not for any other organization.\n\n\u201cAgencies such as NASA have much to offer when it comes to understanding UAP,\u201d Gold\u2019s prepared testimony reads.\n\nUFO Whistleblower Sparks Conversation\n\nMuch of the current conversation surrounding UFOs started when Grusch came forward last year with his claims that the government was operating a secret program dedicated to retrieving crashed UAPs and was in possession of nonhuman craft and biological remains of nonhuman beings.\n\nThe Defense Department has denied these allegations.\n\nStill, they sparked the 2023 congressional hearing on the subject \u2014 the first in more than 50 years \u2014where Grusch testified with former Navy pilot Ryan Graves and Navy Commander David Fravor.\n\nFravor talked about his experience encountering a UAP. Both Graves and Fravor said they were concerned about the risks UAPs pose to the military, regardless of origin.\n\nNetflix faces lawsuit over \u2018The Manhattan Alien Abduction\u2019\n\nLawmakers asked about the secret program referenced by Grusch, and eventually, the hearing led to the formation of a bipartisan UFO Caucus, informally led by Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\nAn official report issued by the Pentagon from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office found no evidence of a secret program. Furthermore, it said the government has no evidence that UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin. However, the Department of Defense did admit to a proposed program known as Kona Blue, which was developed to reverse-engineer any alien technology recovered by the government. This never got off the ground, the DOD said, as no such technology was ever located.\n\nNASA, in a report of its own, said there\u2019s no evidence for extraterrestrial contact with Earth, though the agency said there needs to be more rigorous research in the area and less stigma around the topic as a whole.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Read our coverage for more details and videos from the hearing.\n\nThe U.S. government is holding another hearing on UFOs today, and you can watch it live.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representative's Committee on Oversight and Accountability will administer the hearing, titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\" The name of the event refers to UFOs by their new preferred acronym, which is more inclusive of sightings that might take place not only in the air but also in space, as well as those that take place across multiple domains.\n\nThe hearing will be held at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington D.C. at 11:30 a.m. ET (1630 GMT) on Wednesday (Nov. 13). You can watch it live here on Space.com, courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.\n\nThis marks the second congressional hearing U.S. Congress has put together in order to \"further pull back the curtain on secret UAP research programs conducted by the U.S. government, and undisclosed findings they have yielded,\" according to a House statement. The hearing will examine the U.S. Department of Defense's strict classification policies when it comes to UAP and related topics, and will explore ways to \"make sure the American public is better informed on this topic.\"\n\nThis will be a joint hearing, led by representatives Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) and Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), who argue that \"the American people are tired of the obfuscation and refusal to release information by the federal government,\" according to the House's statement.\n\n\"Americans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose. We can only ensure that understanding by providing consistent, systemic transparency. We look forward to hearing from expert witnesses on ways to shed more light and bring greater accountability to this issue,\" Mace and Grothman said in the statement.\n\nExpert witnesses in the hearing will include Luis Elizondo, a decorated former counterintelligence officer who has claimed for years that the U.S. government is hiding knowledge of UAP, including materials recovered from crashed flying saucers.\n\n\"The cover-up and disinformation campaign has been so successful that most scientists do not even know UAP are real,\" Elizondo wrote in his 2024 book \"Imminent.\" The book also claims that four \"deceased nonhuman bodies\" were recovered from the infamous 1947 crash in Roswell, New Mexico and that \"China and Russia do not have the same stigma and can employ their scientists to work on this topic for them.\"\n\nElizondo has also claimed firsthand knowledge of U.S. programs that employ individuals with psychic powers to \"remote view\" distant locations. Most recently, the former counterintelligence officer held a paid event where a photo was shown that Elizondo claimed was a \"real photo\" of a \"mothership\" UFO above a U.S. embassy. Within days, the photo was found to be the reflection of a lamp in a window.\n\nThe House hearing will also include Tim Gallaudet, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who unidentified submersible objects, arguing that \"these underwater anomalies jeopardize US maritime security.\" Gallaudet has also told interviewers that his daughter is a \"medium\" who can communicate with spirits.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n\u2014 NASA UFO report finds no evidence of 'extraterrestrial origin' for UAP sightings\n\n\u2014 UFO whistleblower tells Congress the US government is hiding evidence of 'non-human intelligence'\n\n\u2014 UFOs worth investigating despite lack of 'real evidence,' former astronaut Scott Kelly says\n\nOther speakers at the hearing include journalist Michael Shellenberger, who has also claimed the U.S. government is hiding UFO crash retrieval programs, and former NASA Associate Administrator of Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold, who is a member of NASA's independent UAP study team.\n\nAccording to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson's remarks in September 2024 when the team's report was released, \"the top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn.\"\n\n\"The NASA independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin, but we don't know what these UAP are,\" Nelson said."

        "article_content": "UFOs came to Washington again today.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth\" at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C. at 11:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday (Nov. 13). Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) is a relatively new catch-all term that includes sightings of unexplained objects or events that take place in the air, underwater, in space, or that travel between those domains.\n\nLike previous congressional UFO hearings, today's event featured testimony from current U.S. military personnel who claim the American government has for decades hidden evidence of advanced technologies and otherworldly visitors from the public. A multitude of anecdotes were presented about flying orbs coming out of the ocean, disc-shaped objects, and craft \"exhibiting flight and structural characteristics unlike anything in our arsenal.\" While such claims are nothing new, what is noteworthy about today's hearing are the pedigrees of some of the whistleblowers who testified, including a former U.S. counterintelligence officer, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former NASA associate administrator. All of them stressed the need for more government transparency, less stigma about the UFO topic and new policies to bring UAP data out of the \"black\" classified world and into the public domain.\n\nA still from a video titled \"Go Fast\" recorded by a U.S. Navy aircraft reportedly showing a UAP that was discussed in the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth\" on Wednesday (Nov. 13). (Image credit: U.S. Department of Defense)\n\nThis isn't the U.S. government's first attempt to investigate the recent wave of UFO claims that began in 2017. A similar hearing was held last year, in which a whistleblower told Congress the U.S. government is hiding evidence of 'non-human intelligence.'\n\nThe Pentagon also created the All-Doman Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate UAP reports and government data about UFOs, but critics, including some government officials, are skeptical of the office's aims and methods.\n\nRelated: UFO whistleblower tells Congress the US government is hiding evidence of 'non-human intelligence'\n\n\"AARO is unable, or perhaps unwilling, to bring forward the truth about the government's activities concerning UAPs,\" Representative Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) said during the hearing's opening remarks today. \"I'm disturbed that AARO itself lacks transparency; even its budget is kept from the public. So if there is no 'there' there, then why are we spending money on it? And by how much? Why the secrecy?\"\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nOther representatives stressed the need for transparency and data analysis today, a common theme of other recent UAP studies. \"We have evidence that what we are detecting things, and we know that we don't understand them, and this is worth investigating,\" Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said. \"I believe we can always be more transparent. To me, this hearing and others are simply about the truth and getting to the facts of what these UAPs actually are.\"\n\nLuis Elizondo, a former U.S. counterintelligence officer who has been vocal about such claims in recent years, told the assembled representatives at the hearing that \"excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public \u2014 all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nWe are \"in the midst of a multi-decade, secretive arms race \u2014 one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies,\" Elizondo stated during his testimony.\n\nElizondo, who claims to have previously investigated UFOs as part of a secret Pentagon program, suggested that the U.S. government create a \"whole-of-government\" approach to studying UAP, create a national UAP strategy and offer protections so that whistleblowers who are \"desperate to do the right thing can come forward without fear.\"\n\nDuring questioning, Elizondo was asked if some of the \"advanced technologies\" that have been seen monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe could be operated by aliens or private companies. \"Maybe both,\" Elizondo replied.\n\nElizondo also stated point-blank to Rep. Mace's questioning that the U.S. government has programs to retrieve crashed UAP and reverse-engineer them, but avoided giving any specifics in an unclassified public setting such as the hearing.\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) then questioned Elizondo, asking the former counterintelligence agent about a document he signed that limits him from speaking publicly about crash retrieval programs. \"The document said you can't talk about crash retrieval. Well, you know, you can't talk about Fight Club if there's no Fight Club, correct?\"\n\nLike other witnesses, Elizondo stated that the alleged excessive government secrecy around UFOs harms national security. In response to questioning from Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN), Elizondo stated that, if UAP sightings turned out to be technologies operated by adversarial nations, it would be \"an intelligence failure eclipsing 9/11 in order of magnitude.\"\n\nA still from footage shot by an MQ-9 reaper drone showing an unidentified spherical object soaring through the air shown to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services during an April 2023 hearing. (Image credit: U.S. Dept. of Defense)\n\nRetired U.S. Navy rear admiral Tim Gallaudet offered similar testimony as Elizondo. \"We know from last year's UAP hearing and recent statements and publications by credible whistleblowers that UAP, NHI [non-human intelligence], and their technology of unknown origin (TUO) represent a new realization that we are not the only advanced intelligence in the universe,\" Gallaudet said on Wednesday, according to his published remarks.\n\n\"Unelected officials in the U.S. government do not have an exclusive right to this knowledge about the nature of reality. The American people have a right to that knowledge,\" Gallaudet said. The retired rear admiral also stressed the national security and airspace safety concerns related with UAP sightings, calling them \"extensive.\"\n\nWhen Rep. Garcia asked Gallaudet and other witnesses what UAP might represent, the retired rear admiral said he believes they are evidence of a \"non-human higher intelligence.\"\n\nFormer NASA Associate Administrator for Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold also testified at today's hearing, and previously served on NASA's UAP study team. Gold's testimony was more grounded; for example, he stressed the need for NASA to contribute its authority and expertise toward analyzing what UAP data it might already possess and helping dispel the stigma associated with the UFO topic.\n\n\"Our best tool for unlocking the mystery of UAP is science, but we cannot conduct a proper inquiry if the stigma is so overwhelming that just daring to be part of a NASA search team elicits such a vitriolic response,\" Gold said during today's hearing. \"Therefore, one of the most important actions that can be taken, relative to exposing the truth of UAP, is to combat the stigma, and this is where I believe that NASA can be eminently helpful.\"\n\nGold added that NASA has a massive archive of data that could possibly contain evidence of UAP, and suggested that artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms could help sort through the agency's trove of data to help shine light on the UFO phenomenon. In addition, the former NASA associate administrator said the agency should develop specialized instruments that might be able to gather useful data about UAP.\n\nRelated: NASA UFO report finds no evidence of 'extraterrestrial origin' for UAP sightings\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger also testified today, telling the representatives that there's a \"growing body of evidence that the government is not being transparent about what it knows about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly called UFOs, and that elements within the military and IC [intelligence community] are in violation of their Constitutional duty to notify Congress of their operations.\"\n\nShellenberger stated that there is a secret program within the U.S. government known as \"Immaculate Constellation\" whose sole purpose is to collect UFO and UAP reports from military personnel and sensor data and quarantine them away from the rest of the government and military. While he noted that a Pentagon spokesperson has stated no such program exists, Shellenberger recounted prior examples in which the Department of Defense has initially denied knowledge of UAP-related information only to later change its stance and either admit the information exists or release it to the public.\n\n\"The U.S. government appears to know significantly more about UAPs than it is revealing,\" Shellenberger said at the hearing. \"But even those who believe the U.S. government has revealed all that it knows should have no objection to Congressional demands for greater transparency.\"\n\nTo conclude the meeting, Rep. Mace asked each of the witnesses to define what non-human biologics or non-human intelligence mean to each of them.\n\n\"I don't think it's a stretch, when you look at the diversity of life on this planet and the size of this universe, to think that there will be more diverse, higher-order, non-human intelligence throughout the universe, and that's probably what's visiting us,\" Gallaudet said.\n\nElizondo stated he would take a scientific approach: \"The definition would be the ability to react to a stimulus in a manner that requires an intellectual thought process.\"\n\nGold, meanwhile, questioned whether non-human intelligence necessarily implies life, suggesting sophisticated artificial intelligence might be responsible for some UAP encounters. Shellenberger simply stated he did not know what they might be.\n\nRelated: The search for alien life\n\nIn today's hearing, as in other UFO hearings, there was a lot of telling and not a lot of showing. One of the core tenets of these whistleblower testimonies is that much of the credible UFO data is classified and can't be revealed to the public based on the military capabilities that some of that data could reveal.\n\nWhistleblowers have attested for years that, because advanced or classified sensors and satellites sometimes capture footage or photos of unexplained phenomena or advanced craft, those photos or videos are likewise classified by the U.S. government in order to not reveal America's full surveillance or sensing capabilities.\n\nSuch was the case in 2023 when U.S. military aircraft shot down a mysterious object off the coast of Alaska. The American government has yet to release any imagery from the event, but a Canadian freedom of information request unveiled a photograph earlier this year of a balloon-like object.\n\nThose incidents and others like it, such as a weeks-long drone incursion above Langley Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., were discussed in today's hearing. \"The origin of these drones and their operators remains a mystery,\" Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said. \"This incident and other sightings near sensitive military installations highlights the complexity of the UAP challenge facing our intelligence, defense and homeland security committees.\""

        "article_content": "Experts testify at UFO hearing in Congress\n\n\n\n\n\nIs intelligent alien life darting around in space \u2014 and even in the skies above us here on Earth? Has the U.S. government been covering up unexplained phenomena, and using secret extraterrestrial discoveries to boost its own technology? Those are among the questions members of Congress discussed Wednesday in a joint hearing by subcommittees of the House Oversight Committee. Its title: \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\" Four experts testified in the public hearing. You can watch the proceeding here. The Pentagon issued a report in March saying that it has found no evidence of extraterrestrial spacecraft. Extraordinary moments unfolded in a similar hearing last year, most notably when retired Maj. David Grusch, formerly part of the Pentagon's UAP Task Force, alleged that the U.S. government has recovered nonhuman \"biologics\" from crash sites and has long operated a secret reverse-engineering program to glean advances from recovered vessels.\n\nGrusch isn't among the witnesses for the 2024 hearing. Instead, those testifying include: Tim Gallaudet, retired rear admiral, U.S. Navy; CEO of Ocean STL Consulting, LLC \"Confirmation that UAPs are interacting with humanity came for me in January 2015,\" Gallaudet said in his written testimony. He describes being part of a pre-deployment naval exercise off the U.S. East Coast that culminated in the famous \"Go Fast\" video, in which a Navy F/A-18 jet's sensors recorded \"an unidentified object exhibiting flight and structural characteristics unlike anything in our arsenal.\" He was among a group of commanders involved in the exercise who received an email containing the video, which was sent by the operations officer of Fleet Forces Command, Gallaudet said.\n\n\"The very next day, the email disappeared from my account and those of the other recipients without explanation,\" he said. Luis Elizondo, author and former Department of Defense official Elizondo's testimony is brief and sure to raise scrutiny, alleging that a secretive arms race is playing out on the global stage. \"Let me be clear: UAP are real,\" he writes. \"Advanced technologies not made by our Government \u2014 or any other government \u2014 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe. Furthermore, the U.S. is in possession of UAP technologies, as are some of our adversaries.\" Elizondo is a former intelligence officer who later \"managed a highly sensitive Special Access Program on behalf of the White House and the National Security Council,\" according to his official bio.\n\n\"By 2012, [Elizondo] was the senior ranking person of the DOD's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, a secretive Pentagon unit that studied unidentified anomalous phenomena,\" his bio states, adding that he resigned in 2017. Michael Gold, former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships; member of NASA UAP Independent Study Team Gold's testimony stresses the need for government agencies and academics to \"overcome the pernicious stigma that continues to impede scientific dialogue and open discussions\" about unexplained phenomena. \"As the saying goes, the truth is out there,\" Gold said, \"we just need to be bold enough and brave enough to face it.\" Michael Shellenberger, founder of Public, a news outlet on the Substack platform\n\nShellenberger's testimony runs to some 214 pages, including a lengthy timeline of UAP reports from 1947 to 2023. Shellenberger presses the White House and Congress to act, calling for the adoption of UAP transparency legislation and cutting funds for any related programs that aren't disclosed to lawmakers. \"UAP transparency is bi-partisan and critical to our national security,\" his written testimony states. Reports of UFOs and UAPs are now more centralized"

These new AI-powered tools are currently available for Windows 11 Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels.\n\nPaint is getting two new AI features. The first is called \"Generative Fill,\" similar to PhotoShop; it lets users add or modify elements in their artwork by describing the desired changes.\n\nThe second feature of Paint, \"Generative Erase,\" lets users remove unwanted objects from their canvas, similar to Google Photo's Magic Eraser. The AI then fills in the empty space, making it look like the object was never there.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"With generative fill, you can make edits and additions with just a few words while maintaining the existing art style of your project. We are also introducing generative erase, a new AI-powered tool that helps you remove unwanted objects from the canvas, filling in the empty space left behind to make it look like the object was never there.\" said the product manager of the Windows Inbox Apps group, Dave Grochocki, reports Bleeping Computer.\n\nNotepad is also receiving an AI upgrade with the \"Rewrite\" feature, previously known as CoWriter. This tool allows users to rephrase sentences, adjust the tone of their text, and modify the content's length based on their preferences.\n\nThe Rewrite feature in Notepad is currently available in preview to Windows 11 users in select countries, including the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, and Germany. Users need to sign in with a Microsoft account to access this feature.\n\nIf the generative fill turns out to be as good as what Adobe has for Photoshop, it can be a real changer for Microsoft Paint. Maybe I'll start using it again after last using it in 5th grade."

        "article_content": "From the supernatural to the super-neurotical.\n\nResearchers at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK set out to determine whether paranormal beliefs \u2014 be it in religion, witchcraft or new age spirituality \u2014 are an indicator of how well people manage stress.\n\nThey discovered a link between one group of beliefs and a reduced ability to cope with stressors.\n\n3 Are superstitions stressing you out? brillianata \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nParticipants in the study were tasked with filling out a questionnaire called the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale. The scale measures the degree of belief in each of these seven categories: traditional religious belief, psi, witchcraft, superstition, spiritualism, extraordinary life forms and precognition.\n\nThese are further broken down into dimensions: The first, \u201ctraditional\u201d paranormal belief, includes religious belief and witchcraft. The second, new age philosophy, encompasses things like spiritualism, precognition and extraordinary life forms.\n\nA quarter of adults in the US consider themselves superstitious, and recent trends reveal that younger people are more superstitious than older adults.\n\nResearch team lead Kenneth Drinkwater, Ph.D., and his colleagues had 3,084 people complete the questionnaire evaluating different facets of perceived stress.\n\nTheir findings, published today in the journal PLOS ONE, revealed that those who scored higher for traditional paranormal belief reported elevated distress levels and reduced ability to manage stress.\n\nHowever, belief in new age philosophies, including psi, was not linked to increased distress and/or decreased ability to cope.\n\nEarlier research has suggested that, in general, belief in the paranormal is not linked to stress vulnerability. Yet research on superstitious belief, a subset of paranormal belief, has suggested that people rely on superstitions in stressful situations to gain an illusion of control over outcomes.\n\n3 The revised Paranormal Belief Scale differentiates between traditional superstitions and new-age philosophies. STGZ. \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nAs an article in the International Journal of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences states, \u201cSuperstition has its roots in our species\u2019 youth, when our ancestors could not understand the forces and whims of [the] natural world. Our ancestors\u2019 survival was threatened by predation or other natural forces.\u201d\n\nThese latest findings are in line with the idea that traditional paranormal beliefs are a response to feelings of anxiety related to an individual\u2019s lack of control over external forces.\n\nThe research team notes that this study is exploratory and does not support any causal relationship.\n\nGet the latest breakthroughs in medicine, diet & nutrition tips and more.

However, additional research is still needed to further explore these fascinating relationships in connection to perceived stress, well-being and coping styles.\u201d"

        "article_content": "\u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d house may still be \u201chaunted\u201d 50 years after the real-life massacre that inspired the book and movies, neighbors and a paranormal expert close to the case claim.\n\nThe Long Island home could still have \u201cdormant\u201d demonic entities inside, waiting to be reawoken and conjured anew years after the infamous 1974 murder of six family members there.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. I believe there are more things in this world that we don\u2019t understand, and I don\u2019t discount the possibility at all,\u201d said Fran Walters, who has lived next door for the last 28 years.\n\n\u201cWhen I first moved out here, I\u2019d walk by there and I could not believe there was a little girl playing in the front, and I remember thinking, \u2018How could a family with little kids buy this house?'\u201d she said.\n\n5 On Nov. 13, 1947, Ronald DeFeo, 23, walked through his Amityville home and executed his sleeping family Newsday via Getty Images\n\nThe house has long attracted curiosity seekers over its claims that it is haunted, but the legends began with a real-life crime on Nov. 13, 1974.\n\nAt around 3 a.m., 23-year-old Ronald \u201cButch\u201d DeFeo rose from bed with a .35 caliber rifle in his hands and executed his parents and four siblings as they slept.\n\nHe then got dressed, and went to work. It wasn\u2019t until hours later that DeFeo burst into a neighborhood bar and claimed somebody had attacked his family.\n\nThe next year DeFeo was sentenced to life in prison, but he spent his life blaming a long list of others \u2014 at one point reportedly claiming \u201cvoices\u201d coming from the house urged him to do it.\n\nThough DeFeo was believed to be a heavy drug user, famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren \u2014 who have since been fictionalized in \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d series of movies \u2014 came to believe he was performing satanic rituals, and those voices may have been demonic forces he unleashed on the house.\n\n5 DeFeo was sentenced to life in prison, and died in 2021 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\u201cDeFeo was into Satanism,\u201d said Tony Spera, the Warrens\u2019 son-in-law, who now leads the couple\u2019s New England Society of Psychic Research. \u201cHe had a little room they called the red room because it was painted red, and there\u2019s a little cubby hole and he kept his satanic artifacts in there.\n\n\u201cThings were happening in the home,\u201d Spera told The Post. \u201cSomething was going on in that house that was nefarious, and we believe it was Ronald DeFeo Jr. doing these satanic rituals.\u201d\n\nAs DeFeo was being sentenced, George and Kathy Lutz moved into the Amityville house with their three kids at a bargain price of $80,000.\n\nOver the next 28 days, the family claimed they were harassed by a host of terrifying happenings \u2014 including levitations and visions of hags, the children sleeping face-down just as the DeFeos bodies were found, freezing temperatures while fireplaces raged, and slime oozing from walls and doors.\n\n5 Tony Spera, the son-in-law of Ed and Lorraine Warren, cautioned that the Amityville house could still be haunted Matthew McDermott\n\nThey fled the home before the month was out, and after a local news station camped out at the house for a segment the Warrens showed up to investigate \u2014 but the Lutzes reportedly refused to go back inside with them.\n\n\u201cThere was an arrangement for George to meet Ed and Lorraine at a pizza place about five blocks away from the Amityville house,\u201d Spera recounted. \u201cEd said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s go to the house and check it out.\u2019\n\n\u201cGeorge stands up, pulls out the keys to the house. He goes, \u2018Here\u2019s the keys. I\u2019m not going in that house \u2026 I\u2019m not going anywhere near that house. Do me a favor, Ed, in such-and-such a drawer there\u2019s a deed to the house. Just get me that, will you?\u2019\u201d\n\nMonths later the Lutzes inked a book deal to tell their story, with \u201cThe Amityville Horror: A Story,\u201d which came out in 1977 and was an immediate success, sparking an even more successful film and sequels.\n\nThough many wrote it off as a hoax \u2014 DeFeo\u2019s own attorney, William Weber, later claimed he and the family concocted the story over several bottles of wine \u2014 the Lutz parents stood by their story for life.\n\n5 George and Kathy Lutz stood by their haunting story their entire lives Getty Images\n\nAnd while the house has changed hands numerous times since the Lutzes left, none of the owners have ever reported any hauntings over those five decades \u2014 something Spera thinks doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the Lutzes were lying, or that whatever haunted them is really gone.\n\n\u201cEd used to not want to talk very much about it, because he said the more recognition you give to it, the more likely something would happen. It depends on the entity, too, that might be at that house. It may lay dormant for years,\u201d Spera said.\n\n\u201cThere could possibly \u2014 and I\u2019m emphasizing the word possibly \u2014 still be something dormant in that structure that could reignite with either recognition, or somebody doing rituals in the house, incantations, or a family that is susceptible to hauntings \u2014 in other words, a family that\u2019s weak-willed, or someone in the house that\u2019s weak-willed.\n\n5 The Amityville house has changed hands numerous times since 1974, but nobody has reported a haunting since Getty Images\n\n\u201cSo in other words, I can move into a house. I can make it haunted. I can make the house haunted by dabbling in occult practices, by doing witchcraft, incantations, satanic rituals, using a Ouija board in the house,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhen you do things like that, you\u2019re inviting things into your life. You\u2019re inviting the unknown in.\u201d\n\nThe current residents of the house \u2013 along with one of the Lutz children \u2013 declined to comment.\n\nAs for Walters \u2014 who \u201cmade it a point to never ever, ever watch the movie\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s ventured inside the \u201cbeautiful\u201d home once during an estate sale, but wouldn\u2019t consider living there.\n\n\u201cIn the back of my head, the Amityville Horror would always be there. You\u2019d hear a little creak in the night and it might set you off. I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said."

To preserve the historical nature of the event and help tell the stories of the residents of the city, some of the victims who had been buried by the ash and debris from the volcano were eventually cast in plaster. It turns out that the stories of a few of those individuals weren\u2019t quite as truthful as we previously thought.\n\nA new study\u2014published in Current Biology by a team of researchers at Harvard University and the Archaeological Park of Pompeii in Naples, Italy\u2014asserts that ancient DNA taken from some of the victims challenges stories long told about those particular Pompeii citizens.\n\n\u201cThe findings demonstrate the importance of integrating genetic analysis with archaeological and historical information to enrich or correct narratives constructed based on limited evidence,\u201d Alissa Mittnik, a co-author of the study, said in a statement.\n\nRelated Story Roman Coins, Graves Found in Pompeii Shop Dig\n\nFor decades, many of the stories told about the relationships and connections between individuals discovered within the Archaeological Park of Pompeii were based simply on the physical appearances of the victims and their proximity to one another. In one situation, for example, the tableau of an adult with a golden bracelet holding a child on their lap was interpreted as a mother holding her offspring. This recent DNA analysis, however, shows that there was no maternal presence or any familial relationship involved in the scene. Instead, the adult in the scene wearing the jewelry was a male who was biologically unrelated to the child.\n\nA second scene features four victims huddled together, often believed to be a family. But when the research team analyzed DNA from three of the victims, they found no genetic ties between them.\n\nIn a third situation, two individuals are seen lying in what is believed to be an embrace. Some have hypothesized the two people could be sisters, a mother holding a daughter, or even lovers. The DNA shows that at least one of the two people was a male, eliminating two of the three common interpretations.\n\nThe ancient eruption buried several Roman towns, killing inhabitants and laying ash deposits across cities that preserved everything from buildings to sculptures and mosaics to human victims. Shortly following the eruption, rain helped functionally cement the bodies within the ash. When excavators descended upon the area centuries later, the outlines of roughly 1,000 victims remained and\u2014in over 100 cases\u2014the cavities were filled in with plaster to preserve their positioning.\n\nRelated Story Before Volcanoes, Pompeii Struggled with Potholes\n\nWhile this DNA analysis dispels some of the myths of Pompeii, the goal of the team behind this work was not necessarily to sleuth out any definitive histories. And DNA on its own wouldn\u2019t be enough to know the stories of these victims. For one, some of the remains may have been moved from their original positions, and the plaster casts could have been \u201ccreatively restored\u201d in the past, the study authors wrote. The team also warned that using so few clues, such as jewelry, to spin a full tale proves risky, especially in an area rich with differing cultures.\n\nThe intent of the team was never to get these stories right once and for all\u2014rather, they wanted to ensure that the tales were merely less wrong. \u201cInstead of establishing new narratives that might also misrepresent these people\u2019s experiences,\u201d David Reich, co-senior author of the study, said in a statement, \u201cthe genetic results encourage reflection on the dangers of making up stories about gender and family relationships in past societies based on present-day expectations.\u201d"

(NASDAQ: BIDU and HKEX: 9888), a leading AI company with strong Internet foundation, today hosted its annual flagship technology conference Baidu World 2024 in Shanghai. At the event, the company announced a range of new AI technologies and solutions to accelerate the boom of AI applications, featuring iRAG (Image-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a new technology designed to tackle hallucinations in image generation, and Miaoda, a no-code tool that empowers businesses and individuals to create applications.\n\nThe launch comes amid surging demand for Baidu's AI offerings, as evidenced by the ERNIE foundation model's daily API calls reaching 1.5 billion by early November. This represents a substantial 30-fold increase from the 50 million announced a year ago.\n\n\n\nERNIE's daily API calls reach 1.5 billion by early November 2024\n\n\"The growth rate exceeded my expectations,\" said Robin Li, Co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Baidu, who described the steep increase as a reflection of the explosive growth in generative AI applications in China over the past two years.\n\n\n\nRobin Li, Co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Baidu, speaks at Baidu World 2024\n\nLooking ahead, Li emphasized that agents will serve as the predominant form of AI applications and are approaching a tipping point of explosive growth. Underscoring this point, Li introduced the Top 100 Agents and Top 100 Industry Applications on the ERNIE AgentBuilder platform.\n\nBaidu World 2024 also highlighted the latest user growth for ERNIE Bot, ERNIE's expanding role in enterprise applications, and featured the debut of Xiaodu AI Glasses by Xiaodu Technology.\n\nNew iRAG Technologyto Mitigate Hallucinations in Image Generation\n\nHallucinations, a phenomenon in which AI generates false or misleading information, have remained one of the most intractable barriers to the widespread adoption of generative AI. In text generation, RAG technology has largely resolved the problem of hallucinations, greatly enhancing the accuracy of generated answers. However, in the field of multimodality, hallucinations remain a key obstacle, often manifesting as inaccurate depictions of people or landmarks.\n\nBaidu's newly launched iRAG technology can mitigate hallucinations in text-to-image generation. Leveraging Baidu Search's vast collection of hundreds of millions of images and the company's strong foundation model capabilities, the new technology enables text-to-image models to deliver hyper-realistic visuals while also significantly reducing the cost of image production. The ability of the iRAG to reduce hallucinations boosts the applicability of images generated by text-to-image models across visual mediums, including comics, storyboards, posters, among others. Li described the reduction of hallucinations as laying the groundwork for the coming boom in AI applications.\n\nMiaoda: Building Applications with Natural Language\n\nBaidu also unveiled Miaoda, a no-code tool that makes it possible to build entire applications simply by describing them in natural language. Miaoda provides no-code programming, multi-agent collaboration, and multi-tool invocation. No-code programming allows anyone to generate code without writing a single line, lowering barriers to AI development and making it accessible to all. Its multi-agent collaboration leverages ERNIE's thinking and planning capabilities to coordinate and manage different agents effectively, while its multi-tool invocation taps into ERNIE's tool invocation abilities, extensively utilizing web search, iRAG, maps API, and other tools for a seamless workflow.\n\n\"Baidu isn't aiming to launch a 'super app'; instead, we aim to help more people and businesses create millions of 'super useful' applications,\" Li said.\n\nMirroring the real-world product development process, Miaoda draws on the abilities of different agents across multiple domains such as project management and planning, content editing, programming and quality control. Miaoda can even automatically identify bugs and use a range of tools. Li called it \"the most complex application case of multi-agent collaboration to date\".\n\nMiaoda empowers everyone with the capabilities of a programmer \u2013 anyone who can speak, can create applications, greatly enhancing human productivity.\n\nAgents as the Next Frontier in AI Application\n\n\"Today, while all leading global tech firms are paying attention to agents, few have made them as central to their strategy as Baidu has,\" Li said at the event. He likened the potential of agents to websites in the PC era and social media accounts in the mobile age.\n\n\"Agents are more human-like, more intelligent, and act like your sales, customer service representatives, or assistants. Agents will become a new vehicle for content, information and services,\" Li added.\n\nFour types of agents \u2013 company, character, tool, and industry \u2013 were highlighted at the event to demonstrate the potential of agents in the AI era. Company agents, for example, differ from traditional websites that only show static company and product information, and can instead proactively recommend products based on customer needs and respond promptly to service requests, greatly improving the efficiency of interactive marketing. After deploying an agent powered by ERNIE, automaker BYD saw a 119% increase in lead conversion.\n\nLi also offered the example of the tool agent Free Canvas, developed in collaboration between Baidu Wenku and Baidu Drive. It allows users to drag and drop documents, audio, video, and other materials onto a canvas-like interface to quickly generate multimodal content. Similarly, the industry agent Faxingbao was specifically developed for the legal field. It has answered over 16.6 million legal questions and can also calculate compensation, draft legal documents, and recommend suitable lawyers.\n\nTo date, Baidu's ERNIE AgentBuilder has garnered the interest of 150,000 businesses and 800,000 developers. The top 100 agents encompass character-based agents like the \"Farmer Academician\", as well as agents for tools, industries, workplace, emotions, and entertainment.\n\nExpanding ERNIE's Reach with Growing Developer Community, Enterprise Applications and AI Glasses\n\nHaifeng Wang, Chief Technology Officer of Baidu, announced that ERNIE Bot has amassed 430 million users, while the PaddlePaddle deep learning platform and ERNIE have a total of 18.08 million developers. Wang also mentioned that the ERNIE foundation model is still in training, with an even more powerful version worth looking forward to.\n\nDou Shen, Executive Vice President of Baidu and President of Baidu AI Cloud Group, highlighted that the Qianfan platform has helped customers fine-tune 33,000 models, and develop 770,000 enterprise applications. Shen noted that the explosion in new AI applications has begun on the enterprise front, supported by a new AI infrastructure comprising an enterprise-level foundation model engineering platform and a heterogeneous computing platform, poised to replace traditional cloud computing.\n\nYing Li, CEO of Xiaodu Technology, introduced Xiaodu AI Glasses, the first native AI glasses powered by a Chinese language foundation model. Powered by ERNIE and equipped with visual, audio, and location-based capabilities, these smart glasses serve as a versatile AI assistant across everyday scenarios. They function as a personal tour guide, offer information via Baidu Maps and Search, and excel in instant translation and content summarization from photos. Ideal for both academics and casual readers, they also assist with intelligent note-taking and can personalize music to enhance the user's surroundings. Li revealed that Xiaodu AI Glasses will be available for sale in the first half of 2025."

Global emissions from coal, oil and gas are all projected to increase.\n\nThe news comes as global leaders gather at the COP29 UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan \u2014 talks which have been overshadowed by anxiety over what a new Trump administration will mean for global climate action. The urgency is clear, however, this year is \u201cvirtually certain\u201d to be the hottest on record, and has seen back-to-back hurricanes, catastrophic flooding, devastating typhoons and severe drought.\n\n\u201cThe impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly dramatic, yet we still see no sign that burning of fossil fuels has peaked,\u201d said Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate professor at the University of Exeter, who led the study, published Tuesday by the Global Carbon Project, a consortium of scientists.\n\nWhile fossil fuels make up the bulk of planet-heating pollution, the other main source is land-use change, including deforestation. Those emissions are also set to go up in 2024, according to the report, exacerbated by this year\u2019s severe droughts and fires.\n\nThere was some more positive news: emissions are set to decline in the US and Europe, and China\u2019s emissions are slowing, and could even see a decline this year, the research projected. But that progress is offset by increases in much of the rest of the world, including India.\n\nTotal global climate pollution will reach 41.6 billion metric tons this year, up from 40.6 billion metric tons last year, according to the report.\n\nThe increase may not seem huge, but it puts the world way off track for tackling the climate crisis.\n\nA UN report published in October said global carbon emissions were slowly plateauing and had raised the possibility they could fall this year.\n\nFossil fuel pollution needs to roughly halve over this decade to keep global warming lower than 1.5 degrees Celsius, a threshold countries have pledged to try to stay below in the Paris climate agreement.\n\nClimate change is already having catastrophic impacts. But scientists warn that at 1.5 degrees, it begins to exceed the ability of humans and the natural world to adapt \u2014 including potentially triggering devastating climate tipping points.\n\nHumanity has already lived through 12-month periods above this critical climate limit but scientists are more concerned about longer timeframes. Tuesday\u2019s study estimates that at current rates of emissions, there is a 50% chance the world will breach 1.5 degrees consistently in about six years.\n\nSome companies and governments have emphasized carbon removal as a key way to bring global temperatures down, but current technology is only removing around one-millionth of the carbon pollution produced by fossil fuels, the report found.\n\n\u201cTime is running out,\u201d Friedlingstein said, adding, \u201cworld leaders meeting at COP29 must bring about rapid and deep cuts to fossil fuel emissions.\u201d"

Most were simple security updates, while others included new features and OS upgrades. Fans expected an update in October, but Google delayed it until this month. This update will resume the rollout of Wear OS 5 to Pixel Watch 1 and Pixel Watch 2 users after a series of crashes caused Google to pause it back in September. After several months of work, the company has addressed the cause of the crashes and is confident that yesterday\u2019s update will be stable.\n\nIn addition to Wear OS 5, the update will also include better camera controls and changes to the Pixel Recorder app, which will be available through the Play Store. Your individual watch will notify you when the update is available for download, so you don\u2019t have to constantly check for it. The first update for the Pixel Watch 3 since its launch is also coming with bug fixes and security updates. All Pixel Watch models will eventually update to version AW2A.241105.012, although when the update happens will depend on both the carrier and the device.\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019re going to have to wait a while for the next Pixel Watch software updates, which Google says won\u2019t come until March 2025. Before now, Pixel Watch users have never before seen a three-month gap in updates. The longest time between updates usually coincided with operating system upgrades, such as from Wear OS 3 to Wear OS 4. That said, slower updates aren\u2019t necessarily a downside. By reducing the time spent on deploying bug fixes, Google could potentially focus on releasing regular, larger updates \u2014 maybe quarterly versus monthly.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile the wait is unfortunate, it does have a gleaming silver lining. The schedule for the next update lines up with a March Feature Drop. You can expect some significant upgrades and improvements, along with a few updates we already know are coming like the Android 15 QPR2 beta. Expect to see changes not only in how the Pixel Watch works, but also in how it interacts with Android. It\u2019s also safe to say that there are likely several surprises we haven\u2019t come across yet."
