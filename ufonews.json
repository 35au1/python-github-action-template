            "article_content": "The internet has been left divided over an 'egg-shaped craft' recorded during a UAP retrieval operation after the video was aired on TV for the first time.\n\nNewsNation aired the footage that 'clearly showed' the object dangling in a sling from a helicopter on Saturday night.\n\nThe alleged craft was about 20ft long and resembled the UAP encountered by the Navy off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects, NewsNation reported.\n\nIt was pointed out in the video that the object had no markings, being 'perfectly smooth', and no 'visible' means of propulsion or way to look inside.\n\nAfter the segment aired, Redditors had mixed opinions on the footage's veracity, although many were impressed by what they saw.\n\n'This is pretty cool. I don\u2019t know what you guys were expecting of a nighttime retrieval. This is actually more clear than I thought it would be. It helps to lower expectations,' one wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'I had a feeling that the video would be somewhat ambiguous. I'm not sure this is gonna move the needle without more substantiating evidence. I think it's great, personally, but this isn't gonna convince Joe Taxpayer.'\n\n'Probably is real. But you aren\u2019t going to convince people with this. To claim this is any different from any other sketchy video already seen (outside the gimbal & go fast) is a stretch & hardly going to make anybody new sit up & take notice. Too bad,' another wrote.\n\nNewsNation aired the footage which 'clearly showed' the object dangling in a sling from a helicopter\n\nThe outlet was told the craft was about 20ft long. It's said to resemble the UAP encountered by the Navy off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects\n\nHowever, other users were much less convinced.\n\n'Well, the video quality is better than I expected, I'll give them that. The object itself? With no frame of reference to judge size, it could be an actual chicken egg as far as I can tell,' one Redditor wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'This video could not have been cheap to make with the cost of eggs these days!'\n\n'No reference to size, this could literally be a chicken egg on a string, with helicopter noises edited in,' a third added.\n\n'This shows nothing. This is not earth shattering, redefining man kind evidence they were promising,' another wrote.\n\nA fifth commented: 'I knew the footage was not going to be good. But what exactly am I looking at here? An egg on the end of a fishing rod?'\n\nOther users pointed out some potential issues with the credibility of the footage.\n\n'What kind of terrain is this supposed to be on? Something about the scaling and shadow feels off,' one questioned.\n\n'Well, the video quality is better than I expected, I'll give them that. The object itself? With no frame of reference to judge size, it could be an actual chicken egg as far as I can tell,' one user wrote\n\nAnother eagle-eyed user said: 'If this was in the desert how is the helicopter not blowing up dust and sand like crazy.'\n\n'So, like, wouldn't they drop off the egg thing on a truck or something or a base? Why are they dropping it off on the ground of what appears an empty desert field?' another wrote.\n\n'No prop wash? I could fake this in my house right now in an hour,' a Redditor added.\n\nAnother user replied by pointing out the lack of sway in the rope.\n\n'So, they retrieved and filmed just an egg-shaped thing. It wasn't flying, it wasn't doing anything. What a load of utter nonsense this is,' one user said.\n\nThe video, which was kept in the dark until its bombshell release, is the latest video footage that has made the rounds online in recent weeks seemingly depicting a UFO.\n\nWidespread interest and coverage of the subject surged after drones were seen flying across New Jersey last month.\n\nOffering a solution to the mystery, Tucker Carlson made a shocking claim that the mysterious drones were controlled by a Chinese mothership satellite.\n\nTucker Carlson discussed the mysterious drones on his show this week, saying he was told the objects were controlled by China\n\nThe White House repeatedly stated that the drone sightings are not a foreign adversary, pose no threat and are not part of a US military operation\n\nThe first sightings appeared over the Picatinny Arsenal in Rockaway and President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster in November, followed by thousands more in the skies.\n\nWhile the US government was quick to dismiss claims they were foreign adversaries, Carlson claimed he was told otherwise.\n\nHe said, 'an intel person' told him that the drones 'were in fact Chinese,' explaining the US government took down a Chinese satellite 'that was a command and control satellite for these drones.'\n\nCarlson appeared to be hinting at a Beijing-operated satellite known as GaoJing 1-02 which fell from space on December 21.\n\nAstronomers tracking such devices confirmed the Chinese satellite re-entered Earth's atmosphere above New Orleans and headed north towards Mississippi, Arkansas and Missouri before burning up in the atmosphere.\n\nBut Carlson claimed it was 'taken down by the US government.'\n\nHe made the claims while speaking with independent journalist Michael Shellenberger, who heard a similar explanation for the drones.\n\n'Somebody told me that that the military got one of the orbs, opened it up and it was Chinese,' Shellenberger said.\n\nThe White House repeatedly stated that the drone sightings - which coincidentally began on November 18 - are not a foreign adversary, pose no threat and are not part of a US military operation.\n\nBut Carlson said his inside source told him that 'the belief was the Chinese government was sending the following message, 'We're moving on Taiwan.''"

That or it\u2019s Mork from Mork and Mindy in his giant egg rolling on the ground under a tarp.

I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.\n\nPlay video\n\n\u201cOver the last couple years, it\u2019s been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP task force that what we were working with that night was, in fact, NHI (nonhuman intelligence) and it was not a unique experience,\u201d they added.\n\nThe report was touted by musician, filmmaker and all-around talented guy Flying Lotus on Twitter. Setting the tone for how people might be absorbing these new revelations.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s the big day huh? Lets see,\u201d he wrote alongside an alien and UFO emoji. \u201cI hear we will see \u2018paradigm shifting\u2019 evidence of a UFO crash retrieval today for the first time from a first hand witness.\u201d\n\nThis is only the latest revelation out of the disclosure we\u2019ve seen in recent years. The end of 2024 into the new year saw plenty of questions about drones across multiple areas on the East Coast. We\u2019ve also heard about the \u201cnonhuman\u201d intelligence during the Congressional testimony from the likes of Lue Elizondo and David Grusch.\n\nIf this turns out to be a Robin Williams clone gone awry, I might just have to hang it up. Life will have officially drifted into being a Family Guy gag."

            "article_content": "Unlike most of the PC gaming world, my ears didn\u2019t perk up when Nvidia announced DLSS Multi-Frame Generation alongside its RTX 50-series GPUs. Although the cards themselves look destined for a slot or two among the best graphics cards, the new DLSS 4 and its Multi-Frame Generation feature that\u2019s exclusive to Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards didn\u2019t stand out. To me, at least.\n\nThat\u2019s because I\u2019ve been using an app called Lossless Scaling for close to a year now, which spent most of the past 12 months laying the groundwork for multi-frame generation. I\u2019ve written about Lossless Scaling too many times to count, but it\u2019s high time to revisit the app once again. Not only is DLSS 4 on the way to show everyone what multi-frame generation is capable of, Lossless Scaling just received the biggest update it\u2019s seen in months.\n\nIt\u2019s really, really good\n\nJacob Roach / Digital Trends\n\nLet me catch you up to speed if you haven\u2019t heard of Lossless Scaling. It\u2019s an upscaling and frame generation utility that\u2019s $7 on Steam. It works with any graphics card, and with any game, and that\u2019s because the frame generation happens at the display step. Unlike DLSS or AMD\u2019s FSR 3, it doesn\u2019t mess with anything in the game engine. That means you can use it with online games and titles that have a frame rate cap, such as Elden Ring.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLossless Scaling doesn\u2019t tap into any AI hardware on your graphics card, but it\u2019s a bit smarter than standard frame interpolation. It has three algorithms available, all of which have been developed using machine learning. And LSFG 3, the latest algorithm, was just released. It offers standard frame generation, as well as triple and quadruple settings, just like DLSS 4. You can even set your own custom frame generation factor, up to 20X. I wouldn\u2019t recommend that, though.\n\nAssuming you have a decent base frame rate, the 4X frame generation works a treat. With the RTX 4080, for example, I was getting around 50 frames per second (fps) at 4K with the highest graphics preset in Marvel Rivals. Tick on Lossless Scaling, and my frame rate jumped to between 170 fps and 180 fps. That\u2019s without any upscaling or other tricks. And despite how competitive Marvel Rivals is, I didn\u2019t feel like I was dragging my mouse through mud.\n\nLossless Scaling 4X\n\nThe latest LSFG 3 algorithm works really well with multi-frame generation, as well. Previously, I tried out the feature in Elden Ring and found too many visual artifacts to stomach. With the new model, any visual artifacts that were present weren\u2019t enough to distract me. Even my cursor was fine, which is an area where I would expect to see major issues with a tool like Lossless Scaling.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, Lossless Scaling has a feature that even pushes beyond what Nvidia offers with DLSS. Below the frame generation section, you\u2019ll find a resolution slider. This reduces the resolution of frames that are passed through the frame generation algorithm in order to reduce latency and improve overall performance. You still see everything at your monitor\u2019s native resolution, but the scale factor helps tremendously in improving performance.\n\nSome downsides\n\nI just gushed about Lossless Scaling, and for good reason. It\u2019s an app I unironically use in nearly every PC game I play. I\u2019ve gotten so much use out of it that I rarely even think about the price tag \u2014 Steam has tracked hundreds of hours of usage time in the app, which is pretty good for only $7. It\u2019s not perfect, though, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same as DLSS 4. It\u2019s just a good compromise.\n\nFirst, your base frame rate. Like any frame generation feature, Lossless Scaling uses frame interpolation. It renders two frames, compares them, and then the algorithm generates a frame to go in between based on the difference between the two rendered ones. This creates additional latency, as your GPU needs to always have a frame buffered before displaying anything to you. And, the latency is compounded if you have a low base frame rate.\n\nThe lower your frame rate, the longer it takes for each frame to be rendered, so there\u2019s far more latency when adding frame generation into the mix. For Lossless Scaling, I recommend at least an average frame rate of 40 fps before engaging frame generation, and ideally close to 60 fps. That way, you\u2019ll still get good responsiveness and a smooth visual experience. In fairness to Lossless Scaling, this is an issue with all frame generation features, and likely something DLSS 4 will struggle with, too.\n\nNvidia\n\nCompared to DLSS 4, the main issue is quality. I haven\u2019t extensively tested DLSS 4 yet. However, it runs within the rendering pipeline, and it has access to data from the game engine like motion vectors. There are a couple of reasons why that gives DLSS 4 an advantage. First, HUD elements. Static elements on your screen like your HUD or crosshair actually aren\u2019t part of the main rendering process \u2014 they\u2019re applied after the fact, and the 3D world is still rendered underneath.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDLSS 4 is able to essentially mask out those elements so there aren\u2019t visual artifacts on them. Lossless Scaling, being at the display stage, sees those elements and isn\u2019t able to mask them out.\n\nIn addition, Lossless Scaling doesn\u2019t always get the frame interpolation perfect. Motion vectors from the game engine describe how objects are moving throughout a scene, so DLSS 4 can better perform the frame interpolation it needs to. That sometimes means you\u2019ll see visual artifacts with Lossless Scaling that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t see with DLSS 4.\n\nThose are fairly minor complaints in the grand scheme. Nvidia\u2019s upcoming RTX 50-series GPUs may be impressive \u2014 I\u2019ll have to wait to test them \u2014 but tools like Lossless Scaling are breaking the price dynamic. If you otherwise have a GPU you\u2019re happy with the performance with, give Lossless Scaling a shot. After all, a $7 app is a heck of a lot better than spending $2,000 on a new graphics card."

Discounted accommodation prices beginning at $149 per night allow you to remain where the paranormal activity occurs throughout ESP.\n\nBuilt in 1886, the Crescent Hotel has a colorful and, at times, frightening past. From its days as a Victorian health spa to its notoriety under Norman Baker, who converted the hotel into a hospital promising miraculous cancer treatments, the hotel has been the setting for successes, tragedies and stories that continue to captivate.\n\nLarry Flaxman, a paranormal theorist, best-selling novelist in the field and the Crescent Hotel's resident paranormal investigator who is speaking at ESP, believes the Crescent's history adds to its continued spiritual presence.\n\n\"The rich history of the Crescent Hotel, including the unscrupulous acts of Norman Baker and the physical, emotional, and mental pain of his cancer patients who occupied the Crescent during its time as a hospital, has left an indelible mark,\" Flaxman said in a 2021 Crescent blog post. \"Hauntings are common in locations where there has been extreme trauma and tragedy, and the long history of tragedies at this property has lent itself to producing an environment highly conducive for paranormal activity and making the Crescent Hotel America's Most Haunted Hotel.\"\n\nAn ESP Weekend schedule offers a range of events geared for both experienced investigators and interested novices. The Crescent's very own tour guides and prominent specialists such as Flaxman and Dave Harkins, founder of the Ozarks Paranormal Society, will lead participants through seminars, talks and extended overnight investigations.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing for me is being able to educate folks about the possibilities, the scientific probabilities of the continuity of life,\" Flaxman said in an over-the-phone interview. \"There's a demonstration that I'll be doing on Saturday that sort of melds quantum mechanics and spirit communication into one.\"\n\nJason 'Iakona' Colobong of the podcast Paranormal Patrol, based in Kansas City, reflects on his own transforming experience at last year's ESP Weekend.\n\nColobong said ESP Weekend 2024 was his team's first foray into official paranormal investigating. They wanted to attend a public event hosted by experienced investigators so they could quietly sit back and see how things were done.\n\n\"Having our first formal investigation at the Crescent set the bar too high,\" Colobong said. \"Our first night at ESP 2024 was so filled with incidents and possible evidence that, when we go to other places, we find ourselves with far less, if any, evidence.\"\n\nThey had an unforgettable encounter in Norman Baker's bedroom, Colobong recounted, recalling how a mist-like figure climbed the stairs in time with the sound of footsteps. One of the other members of Paranormal Patrol, Jennifer Kohl, saw the mist-like figure while Colobong and Frank Pflumm were setting up the cameras and heard the footsteps themselves. When they turned around to see who it was, there was nothing there, but Colobong said Kohl asked over and over if they saw it. The two members didn't and unfortunately did not have the camera recording when it happened. All three disappointed, but still Colobong said the encounter has been one of the highlights of their career so far.\n\nThe real difference between the Crescent's paranormal event and others that the Paranormal Patrol has attended, Colobong said, comes in the overall experience. At the Crescent, visitors have guides and professionals who are all familiar with the common equipment used in the investigations. You don't have to have a large set of skills or even equipment for ESP weekend because the staff is there to help and provide you with what you need, he said.\n\n\"This is one of the best ways to get yourself exposed to the paranormal world without risk or significant cost,\" Colobong said. Paranormal Patrol plans to return to this year's ESP Weekend.\n\nSo the question is: Are you ready to hunt or ready to learn? Whether you're a believer, skeptic, or simply curious, the ESP Weekends allow you to delve into the Crescent Hotel and Spa's historic mysteries.\n\n-\n\nFAQ\n\n14th annual Eureka Springs Paranormal Weekends\n\nWHEN -- Jan. 24-26 and Jan. 31-Feb. 2.

            "article_content": "In a groundbreaking discovery that sounds like science fiction but is absolutely real, researchers have found that your eyes contain hidden signals that could predict your risk of having a stroke. This revolutionary finding isn\u2019t just another medical study, it\u2019s a potential game-changer in how we approach stroke prevention and early detection.\n\nThe incredible science behind retinal fingerprints\n\nScientists have identified 29 unique vascular indicators in your retina that serve as warning signs for stroke risk. These tiny blood vessels in your eyes create patterns as unique as your fingerprints, and their condition can reveal crucial information about your overall health. Within these indicators, 17 are density-related markers that can increase your stroke risk by up to 19% when altered. These changes are like tiny red flags waving in your eyes, signaling potential danger before other symptoms appear. The remaining indicators focus on the size and twistedness of blood vessels, with changes potentially raising stroke risk by nearly 20%. Think of these vessels as tiny roads in your eyes, their condition reflecting the health of your entire cardiovascular system.\n\nWhy this discovery is absolutely mind-blowing\n\nTraditional stroke risk assessments often involve invasive procedures and expensive tests. But this new method requires nothing more than a specialized photograph of your eye. The implications are enormous, especially for communities where access to advanced medical testing is limited or cost-prohibitive.\n\nThe beauty of this breakthrough lies in its simplicity. During a routine eye exam, doctors can capture detailed images of your retina and analyze them for these crucial indicators. It\u2019s painless, quick, and could potentially save countless lives through early detection.\n\nThe fascinating connection between your eyes and brain\n\nYour retina isn\u2019t just a window to your soul, it\u2019s actually an extension of your brain. Every tiny blood vessel in your eye tells a story about the health of your brain\u2019s blood vessels. This connection explains why changes in your retinal vasculature can predict stroke risk with remarkable accuracy.\n\nWhat makes this discovery revolutionary\n\nThe research team analyzed data from over 45,000 participants. This massive study revealed that retinal analysis combined with basic demographic information could predict stroke risk as accurately as traditional methods.\n\nWhat\u2019s truly remarkable is how this technology could transform preventive healthcare. Imagine walking into your local eye clinic and getting a comprehensive stroke risk assessment during your regular eye exam. This isn\u2019t just convenient, it\u2019s revolutionary for global health care accessibility.\n\nThe global impact of this breakthrough\n\nThis discovery could dramatically change how we approach stroke prevention worldwide. In regions where advanced medical facilities are scarce, a simple eye scan could become a lifesaving tool. The technology could help identify at-risk individuals years before they might experience a stroke, allowing for early intervention and prevention strategies.\n\nHealthcare providers are particularly excited about implementing this technology in primary care settings. It could become as routine as checking blood pressure, but with the potential to reveal much more detailed information about cardiovascular health.\n\nWhat this means for the future of healthcare\n\nThe implications extend far beyond stroke prediction. Researchers believe similar retinal analysis could help predict other conditions like heart disease and dementia. This opens up endless possibilities for early detection and prevention of various diseases through simple eye examinations.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, we might see artificial intelligence systems analyzing these retinal images in real-time, providing instant risk assessments and recommendations. This could revolutionize how we approach preventive healthcare, making it more accessible and effective than ever before.\n\nThe discovery of retinal vascular fingerprints as predictors of stroke risk isn\u2019t just a scientific breakthrough, it\u2019s a glimpse into the future of medicine. It shows us that sometimes the most powerful diagnostic tools are hidden in plain sight, waiting to be understood and utilized. As this technology develops and becomes more widely available, it could transform how we approach disease prevention and ultimately save countless lives through early detection and intervention."

            "article_content": "An organization developing math benchmarks for AI didn\u2019t disclose that it had received funding from OpenAI until relatively recently, drawing allegations of impropriety from some in the AI community.\n\nEpoch AI, a nonprofit primarily funded by Open Philanthropy, a research and grantmaking foundation, revealed on December 20 that OpenAI had supported the creation of FrontierMath. FrontierMath, a test with expert-level problems designed to measure an AI\u2019s mathematical skills, was one of the benchmarks OpenAI used to demo its upcoming flagship AI, o3.\n\nIn a post on the forum LessWrong, a contractor for Epoch AI going by the username \u201cMeemi\u201d says that many contributors to the FrontierMath benchmark weren\u2019t informed of OpenAI\u2019s involvement until it was made public.\n\n\u201cThe communication about this has been non-transparent,\u201d Meemi wrote. \u201cIn my view Epoch AI should have disclosed OpenAI funding, and contractors should have transparent information about the potential of their work being used for capabilities, when choosing whether to work on a benchmark.\u201d\n\nOn social media, some users raised concerns that the secrecy could erode FrontierMath\u2019s reputation as an objective benchmark. In addition to backing FrontierMath, OpenAI had access to many of the problems and solutions in the benchmark \u2014 a fact Epoch AI didn\u2019t divulge prior to December 20, when o3 was announced.\n\nIn a reply to Meemi\u2019s post, Tamay Besiroglu, associate director of Epoch AI and one of the organization\u2019s co-founders, asserted that the integrity of FrontierMath hadn\u2019t been compromised, but admitted that Epoch AI \u201cmade a mistake\u201d in not being more transparent.\n\n\u201cWe were restricted from disclosing the partnership until around the time o3 launched, and in hindsight we should have negotiated harder for the ability to be transparent to the benchmark contributors as soon as possible,\u201d Besiroglu wrote. \u201cOur mathematicians deserved to know who might have access to their work. Even though we were contractually limited in what we could say, we should have made transparency with our contributors a non-negotiable part of our agreement with OpenAI.\u201d\n\nBesiroglu added that while OpenAI has access to FrontierMath, it has a \u201cverbal agreement\u201d with Epoch AI not to use FrontierMath\u2019s problem set to train its AI. (Training an AI on FrontierMath would be akin to teaching to the test.) Epoch AI also has a \u201cseparate holdout set\u201d that serves as an additional safeguard for independent verification of FrontierMath benchmark results, Besiroglu said.\n\n\u201cOpenAI has \u2026 been fully supportive of our decision to maintain a separate, unseen holdout set,\u201d Besiroglu wrote.\n\nHowever, muddying the waters, Epoch AI lead mathematician Ellot Glazer noted in a post on Reddit that Epoch AI hasn\u2019t be able to independently verify OpenAI\u2019s FrontierMath o3 results.\n\n\u201cMy personal opinion is that [OpenAI\u2019s] score is legit (i.e., they didn\u2019t train on the dataset), and that they have no incentive to lie about internal benchmarking performances,\u201d Glazer said. \u201cHowever, we can\u2019t vouch for them until our independent evaluation is complete.\u201d\n\nThe saga is yet another example of the challenge of developing empirical benchmarks to evaluate AI \u2014 and securing the necessary resources for benchmark development without creating the perception of conflicts of interest."

            "article_content": "I\u2019ve been a longtime ChatGPT Plus user and talk to the AI chatbot regularly. Whether it\u2019s for work or fun, ChatGPT can be incredibly helpful as long as you\u2019re aware it can hallucinate. It\u2019s never a bad idea to verify its claims, especially if you\u2019re concerned it might be wrong.\n\nI\u2019ve also been keeping up with all the new features that OpenAI has launched in recent years and testing them accordingly. That includes all the UI changes that came with the various novelties that OpenAI added to ChatGPT.\n\nOn that note, I\u2019ll remind you that ChatGPT Search and the addition of Advanced Voice Mode and Canvas made OpenAI deliver several big changes to the ChatGPT UI, which makes the tool even easier to use.\n\nHowever, to get the best results, you need to be mindful of one thing: the prompt. That is your first set of instructions in a conversation. The better the prompt, the faster you get the desired results. Otherwise, you must keep tweaking it for the chatbot to give you what you need.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nThis is where I tell you ChatGPT has a built-in \u201chack\u201d to improve your prompts, one that I\u2019ve missed for many months. It\u2019s called \u201cEdit message,\u201d and it could have saved me hours of prompt editing in all my chats with ChatGPT.\n\nWhenever I start a new conversation with ChatGPT, I try to provide as many details and instructions as possible in the prompt to prevent wasting time with follow-up requests.\n\nSometimes, I get it right on the first try, but many times, I have to tweak my initial request. To fix the prompt, I write a reply in the chat, asking the AI to tweak its response to take into account additional requests.\n\nThe \u201cEdit message\u201d button is right next to your reply. Image source: Chris Smith, BGR\n\nI was testing ChatGPT\u2019s new Tasks feature on Wednesday when I realized I\u2019d been making a huge mistake for months. I ignored the \u201cEdit message\u201d button that appears when you hover over one of your replies. The editing option is available in the mobile app if you touch and hold any of your prompts.\n\nWe\u2019ve been editing replies in instant messenger apps like iMessage and WhatsApp for years. I\u2019m more than familiar with the feature. It\u2019s a great way to fix an error in a chat reply in a text with other people. Of course, you should expect AI chatbots like ChatGPT to offer the same functionality.\n\nYou can change the prompt to something entirely different from your initial request, like I did here. Image source: Chris Smith, BGR\n\nWhy is the \u201cEdit message\u201d so brilliant? Suppose you start a new chat with ChatGPT, and your initial prompt doesn\u2019t yield the desired results. You could tap that button and edit your initial prompt rather than writing a reply to the AI to tweak it. ChatGPT will adapt to the changes automatically and provide a different answer.\n\nThe best part is that ChatGPT will show you the previous response so you can choose how to continue your conversations.\n\nYou can switch between the original ChatGPT response and the ones the AI will offer once you edit your request. Image source: Chris Smith, BGR\n\nThere\u2019s another benefit to using the button. The conversations won\u2019t always be as long, so you\u2019ll have less scrolling to do when revisiting a chat. Also, you can use the button as many times as you need to get the proper start.\n\nThe screenshots above show an example of editing a first prompt in a ChatGPT conversation. I wrote a short prompt, waited for ChatGPT to respond, and then edited the prompt to something entirely different. As you can see in the screenshot sequence, ChatGPT adapted accordingly.\n\nThe \u201cEdit message\u201d button is available for all the user\u2019s replies in a chat, not just the first one.\n\nWhile I missed using this ChatGPT prompt \u201chack\u201d right before my eyes for months, I\u2019ll surely take advantage of it now that I\u2019ve realized how bad my ways were."

            "article_content": "By Chloe Mari A. Hufana, Reporter\n\nA STRICTER monitoring and enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with labor standards is needed amid a \u201cdim\u201d employment outlook, particularly in the country\u2019s service and agriculture sectors, a labor leader said.\n\nA recent International Labour Organization (ILO) report on insufficient global employment growth mirrors the situation in the Philippines, where persistent decent work deficits in the service and agriculture sectors are attributed by the Federation of Free Workers (FFW) to rampant contractualization, low wages, and unsafe working conditions.\n\n\u201cThe outlook remains dim, particularly when considered alongside the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) recent report. It estimates that 14% of the workforce \u2014 around 5 million Filipino workers \u2014 are at risk of displacement this year due to artificial intelligence (AI) and climate change,\u201d FFW President Jose Sonny G. Matula told BusinessWorld in a Viber message over the weekend.\n\nThe ILO\u2019s World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2025, released last week, found employment growth globally remained \u201ctoo weak\u201d to significantly impact lingering decent work deficits.\n\nWhile employment growth remains steady, various factors are testing the resilience of labor markets worldwide, it added.\n\n\u201cThe lack of faster global productivity growth is partly linked to the failure of structural change to move people out of agriculture into manufacturing and services,\u201d it noted.\n\n\u201cGiven the poor working conditions in much of farming outside advanced economies, this also means that working poverty and informality have not benefited from people moving out of agriculture to better-paying jobs in industry and services,\u201d it added.\n\nIndividuals in informal employment, particularly in agriculture and other sectors like wholesale and retail trade, often face irregular income and lack access to social protection, it added.\n\n\u201cIn this context, the vigorous exercise of the Department of Labor and Employment\u2019s (DoLE) inspection and visitorial powers under the Labor Code is essential,\u201d Mr. Matula said.\n\n\u201cStrengthened monitoring and enforcement mechanisms will ensure that employers comply with labor standards, while the Employment Plan should adapt to rapidly changing labor market dynamics, including those influenced by technology and climate change,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 2024, global employment grew alongside the expanding labor force, maintaining the global unemployment rate at a steady 5%, consistent with the level recorded in 2023, the ILO noted.\n\nHowever, this growth remains insufficient to address persistent decent work deficits as young workers continue to face high unemployment rates, around 12.6%, with little sign of improvement, it added.\n\nLabor Secretary Bienvenido E. Laguesma said the department conducted \u201cextensive national consultations,\u201d culminating in the upcoming 10-year Trabaho Para sa Bayan (TPB) Plan to address weak job growth.\n\n\u201cThrough these initiatives, we have identified several key areas of intervention that align with the goals of the TPB Plan and aim to address the challenges of regional employment disparities, particularly in rural areas,\u201d he told BusinessWorld in a Viber message over the weekend.\n\n\u201cAgriculture remains a cornerstone of rural employment, and we are committed to transforming this sector to boost productivity and job creation,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted the Labor department aims to introduce technology-enabled farming practices, climate-resilient methods and value-added processes into agribusiness through the Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives will not only create more jobs but also enhance the sustainability and profitability of rural livelihoods,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Agency\u2019s (PSA) November 2024 Labor Force Survey, the agriculture sector experienced the highest year on year job loss, with 1.99 Filipinos leaving the sector.\n\nThe agency attributed the loss to typhoons.\n\nRURAL WORKFORCE\n\nAccording to Mr. Laguesma, DoLE is empowering local government units (LGUs) to spearhead rural development by supporting them with investment strategies, microfinance for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and infrastructure projects under the Build Better More program.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives will ensure that rural areas become hubs for inclusive economic activity,\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition, DoLE is collaborating with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and local institutions, prioritizing tailored skills training.\n\nPrograms will focus on green skills development, digital upskilling and vocational training to prepare rural workers for opportunities in sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, and renewable energy, he noted.\n\n\u201cOur Public Employment Service Offices (PESOs) are key to facilitating job placement and matching in rural areas,\u201d he added, noting that digitalization and enhancing labor market intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe aim to make employment services more accessible and effective, enabling rural job seekers to connect with opportunities tailored to their skills and aspirations,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe labor chief also added the department is committed to fostering sustainable job opportunities in agriculture, eco-tourism and clean energy. These green initiatives will ensure long-term job creation while protecting environmental resources.\n\nSocial safety nets for rural workers are critical, he noted, adding the ILO has been helping DoLE in achieving these initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe will broaden coverage of social protection programs to include informal workers, addressing vulnerabilities and providing stability during economic transitions,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBy prioritizing rural job creation and addressing regional disparities, we aim to build a resilient and equitable labor market where every Filipino has access to quality employment.\u201d"

            "article_content": "In a dramatic development on Thursday, SpaceX's Starship rocket mission ended abruptly when the spacecraft exploded minutes after launch from Texas. The incident, which involved an upgraded Starship carrying a test payload, prompted airlines to reroute flights over the Gulf of Mexico as debris scattered, marking a setback for Elon Musk's rocket program. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, in coordination with Turks and Caicos officials, is investigating the fallout, though no injuries have been reported.\n\nIn Belgium, scientist Clement Martin is collaborating with federal police to create a groundbreaking scent mimicking the smell of dried bones, helping sniffer dogs locate long-missing remains. This innovation follows Martin's earlier work isolating the scent of decomposing flesh, now essential in training cadaver dogs across Belgium.\n\nMeanwhile, archaeological explorations in Pompeii have uncovered an opulent private bath complex, providing insights into the affluent lifestyle of the Romans before the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The newly unearthed site features hot, warm, and cold baths that could accommodate up to 30 guests, adorned with Greek mythological themes, showcasing the luxury of that era.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an incredible technology, and we've only scratched the surface of its potential. Currently, it's being used as a program on the side of normal work, but it's about to enter a new phase: Agentic AI. Agentic AI, often called AI agents, involves setting up software programs to do tasks that humans normally do. This next phase in implementing AI is critical, as it will allow those at the cutting edge to do more with fewer resources.\n\nOne of the leaders in agentic AI is Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). The software company is making a heavy push to promote and integrate agentic AI, and it also has one of the best platforms for implementing it.\n\nSalesforce's platform is ripe for agentic AI integration\n\nSalesforce makes customer relationship management (CRM) software. CRM is an incredibly broad sector but can generally be summarized as a business interaction with a potential customer from the marketing stage to after-sale support. There's a lot that happens between those two points, and Salesforce software is there to offer support along the way.\n\nMany customer interactions can be automated by AI agents, which is why agentic AI is such a massive trend for Salesforce. As with most software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, the more add-ons you have from the base software package, the more expensive it gets. This unlocks another milestone for the generative AI trend; we're reaching a point where many companies are starting to monetize their AI investments.\n\nSalesforce's CEO and co-founder, Marc Benioff, is extremely bullish on agentic AI. During the company's 2024 Dreamforce conference, he stated, \"This is what AI was meant to be.\" That's a big statement, but the ability for companies to become more efficient and free their workers up to do tasks that require original thinking will be a huge change for many in the workforce.\n\nHowever, does this one technology have the ability to drive Salesforce's stock to new heights?\n\nSalesforce needs this new technology to kick-start growth again\n\nSalesforce is a mature software company that started to shift from growth-at-all-costs to maximizing profitability a few years ago. However, its sales growth has been a bit slow, by most software company standards, over the past few quarters. In its fiscal 2025's third quarter (ended Oct. 31), revenue was up 8% year over year to $9.44 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) were $1.60 versus $1.26 a year ago -- a 27% gain.\n\nEPS growth outpaced revenue growth because of Salesforce's rising margins. During last year's third quarter, Salesforce posted operating margins of 17.8%. This year, it delivered 20.6% operating margins. This will be a key trend to watch, as some of the most profitable software companies can reach profit margins of up to 30%. It will likely be some time before Salesforce can reach that level (if it can), but shareholders will be elated if it does.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "A tech professional recently shared valuable insights on social media about navigating layoffs after being let go by a prominent tech company. Reflecting on his experience, he emphasized the importance of financial preparedness , skill enhancement, and leveraging professional networks. Building an emergency fund with 6\u201312 months of living expenses provided him the flexibility to focus on finding the right opportunity. He also credited certifications in AI and machine learning, such as Google Cloud ML Engineer and Microsoft Azure AI Engineer, for helping his resume stand out and accelerating interview calls. Networking proved critical, with referrals from ex-colleagues, mentors, and LinkedIn posts opening new doors. He also recommended exploring roles in non-tech industries like finance and healthcare, which are increasingly hiring for AI and automation projects. Freelancing, he noted, was another avenue to maintain skills, expand networks, and gain experience while job hunting.In a similar situation, another techie sought advice online after being laid off in September. Having returned to India after working abroad and boasting nine years of experience in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and data, he faced challenges in the local job market, including rejections or significantly lower salary offers. The lack of preparation in competitive coding practices like DSA and Leetcode further added to his struggles. The tech professional expressed frustration and embarrassment after three months without an offer.Online responses suggested exploring opportunities abroad, especially in regions like the Middle East, where AI and tech roles are in demand. Others advised accepting lower-paying offers temporarily while continuing to search for better roles. Some users expressed surprise at the challenges faced by AI and ML professionals, questioning whether the demand in these fields was dwindling or if entry into data science had become increasingly competitive."

Moscow called the attack retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, which in recent weeks appear to have intensified.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said that four ballistic missiles and 39 attack drones had been launched in the assault and that two of the ballistic missiles had been shot down in the Kyiv region. Although the city comes under drone attack almost nightly, ballistic missile launches targeting the capital are less frequent.\n\nThe pre-dawn attack ruptured a water main near the city center, sending water cascading through the streets around the battered facade of the Lukianivska subway station. Nearby, smoke was rising from a charred van with at least two burned bodies inside."

            "article_content": "A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip came into effect on Sunday, following a delay of nearly three hours. The truce halts a devastating 15-month-long conflict that has caused widespread destruction and loss of life. After months of intricate and tense negotiations, the agreement aims to provide a reprieve from the violence that has gripped the region, while addressing the political and humanitarian crises exacerbated by the ongoing war.\n\nDespite the delayed start, residents and medical workers in Gaza reported no new fighting or military strikes after about 30 minutes before the ceasefire was implemented. However, Israeli airstrikes and artillery attacks killed 13 Palestinians in Gaza between 06:30 GMT, when the ceasefire was originally set to begin, and 09:15 GMT, when it was finally enacted, according to Palestinian medics.\n\n#WATCH | Delhi | Reuven Azar, Israeli Ambassador to India, says, \"The ceasefire Israel signed off to is the first phase of a gradual deal which has the potential of bringing back our hostages and also making sure Hamas won't be ever able to massacre Israelis like it did on\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fBZwWi7jNP Also Read Air Canada plane catches fire during landing at Halifax airport, incident happens hours after fatal South Korea plane tragedy \u2013 Watch \u2018IITian Baba\u2019 Abhey Singh expelled from Juna Akhara for disrespecting his guru; he responds Indian Railways\u2019 expansion in West Bengal: 43 rail projects spanning 4,479 km underway in the state, says Ashwini Vaishnaw FPIs turn net sellers after two weeks of buying, withdraw Rs 976 crore amid global uncertainty January 19, 2025\n\nReasons for the Delay\n\nIsrael\u2019s military blamed Hamas for the delay, citing the Palestinian militant group\u2019s failure to provide a list of hostages to be released as part of the agreement. Hamas attributed the delay to \u201ctechnical\u201d reasons, though it did not elaborate further. A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated that the delay was due to mediators requesting 48 hours of \u201ccalm\u201d before the ceasefire, but Israeli strikes had made it difficult to send the list of names.\n\nAlso Read Israeli PM Netanyahu delays Gaza ceasefire until Hamas releases hostage list\n\nTwo hours after the deadline, Hamas announced that it had sent the names of the hostages to be released, with Israeli officials confirming the receipt. The three hostages named for release on Sunday were Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher, and Emily Damari, although Israel did not immediately confirm their identities.\n\nDetails of the Ceasefire Agreement\n\nThe ceasefire deal follows months of on-again, off-again negotiations, involving mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and the United States. The deal, which is seen as a potential step toward ending the Gaza war, is structured in three stages. The first stage will last six weeks and will involve the release of 33 of the remaining 98 hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe first hostages to be released will include women, children, and the elderly, and they are expected to be transferred through the Red Cross. In return for each of the hostages released, Israel will free 30 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas will coordinate with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to determine the meeting points inside Gaza for the handover.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement, though a step forward, does not yet guarantee a full resolution to the conflict. The ongoing war, which erupted after Hamas launched attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, has claimed thousands of lives, with nearly 47,000 Palestinians killed in the conflict. The war has also exacerbated tensions throughout the Middle East, drawing in Iranian-backed militant groups and causing diplomatic isolation for Israel.\n\n(With Reuters Inputs)"

            "article_content": "Adani Energy Solutions Ltd, India's largest electricity transmission and distribution company, has won two new transmission projects, helping swell its order book to \u20b954,700 crore -- more than three times of the work order it had at the start of current fiscal in April 2024.\n\nIn October-December 2024 -- the third quarter of the fiscal year April 2024 to March 2025 (FY25), AESL won two new transmission projects worth \u20b928,455 crore in Rajasthan, related to the renewable energy park, Jefferies said in a report.\n\nThe orders include the \u20b925,000-crore Bhadla-Fatehpur HVDC project, which is AESL's largest order win till date.\n\nThese order wins have pushed up the company's market share in TBCB (tariff-based competitive bidding) orders to 24 per cent, from 17 per cent in the second quarter.\n\nAESL's current order book now stands at \u20b954,700 crore, as compared to \u20b917,000 crore in the beginning of the current financial year. This is the highest order book amongst all private sector transmission companies.\n\nAlso read: ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel to commission 2 million tonne auto grade steel capacity by March\n\nDuring the quarter, the company commissioned one transmission line, adding over 1000 circuit kilometres to its network, which stands at 26,485 cKM and 84,286 MVA of transformation capacity. As of December 2023, these were 20,422 cKM and 54,661 MVA.\n\nIn distribution, the company supplies power to over 3 million customers in Mumbai metropolitan and Mundra SEZ regions. During the quarter, Mumbai market saw a 3 per cent year-on-year increase in power sale to 2.57 billion units, while the Mundra market saw a 30 per cent rise to 236 million units.\n\nThe company has applied for a parallel distribution license in Navi Mumbai, Kutch, and Ghaziabad-Jewar-Bulandshahr area.\n\n\"We believe AESL should see 16 per cent revenue CAGR and 62 per cent profit CAGR in FY24-27E, driven by locked-in growth in both transmission and distribution business,\" Jefferies said. \"\u20b927,300 crore projects are targeted to be commissioned by October 2026\".\n\nIn smart metering, AESL was the lowest bidder in the cancelled smart metering tender of 8.2 million meters in Tamil Nadu. This order quantity is not part of AESL's existing pipeline of 22.8 million meters.\n\nAESL said it will participate in the rebidding when it comes up.\n\nJefferies expects AESL to add 4.5 million smart meters by the end FY25 and 10 million by FY26, of which 7 million will come from existing contracts and balance from new wins.\n\nAESL's capital management program prioritises reducing volatility in interest costs through long-tenure bonds. The company is also refining its debt management strategy to match the life of respective assets at fixed rates as much as possible.\n\n\"AESL's management says it believes in minimising volatility in its asset base across parameters: debt is being refinanced and raised to match the life of the respective asset at a fixed rate as far as possible; vendor back-to-back arrangements to limit the impact of commodity price changes; and land studies for faster project commissioning,\" the report said, adding downside risks include inability to maintain interest rate; and market share loss."

            "article_content": "Recent UFO Cloud Sightings Over the UK: A Growing Phenomenon\n\nIn recent years, the United Kingdom has become a hotspot for unusual atmospheric phenomena, including sightings of UFO clouds. While UFO sightings themselves are not new, there has been a notable increase in reports of strange cloud formations that appear to be connected to UFO activity. These incidents have fuelled speculation that the skies above the UK might be hiding more than just ordinary weather patterns. From rural areas in Scotland to urban centres in England, observers have documented several UFO-related cloud events, prompting fresh debates about the connection between these clouds and extraterrestrial craft.\n\nWhen people think of UFOs, they often envision saucer-shaped craft zooming through the sky, or strange lights darting across the night. However, there is another intriguing phenomenon that has become linked with UFO sightings\u2014UFO clouds. These mysterious cloud formations, which often appear anomalous or out of place, have sparked numerous theories and debates over the years. Are these clouds simply rare meteorological events, or could they be related to extraterrestrial activity? In this article, we explore the fascinating world of UFO clouds, the possible causes behind them, and how they tie into UFO lore.\n\nWhat Are UFO Clouds?\n\nThe term \"UFO cloud\" refers to a type of cloud formation that appears unusual or particularly striking in appearance, often leading observers to associate them with unidentified flying objects or extraterrestrial phenomena. These clouds are typically characterised by their strange shape, colour, or movement, and they often appear in areas where UFO sightings have been reported. While some of these clouds are nothing more than unusual atmospheric phenomena, others appear to defy typical meteorological explanations, sparking theories of alien involvement.\n\nOne of the most common characteristics of UFO clouds is their circular or disc-like shape. They often appear as smooth, flat clouds with defined edges, resembling the classic depictions of UFOs in popular culture. These formations can be strikingly similar to the saucer-shaped objects that UFO enthusiasts believe extraterrestrials use for travel. As a result, many UFO sightings involve reports of a UFO cloud in the vicinity, further fueling speculation about their connection.\n\nThe 2021 \"Saucer Cloud\" Incident Over London\n\nOne of the most widely reported UFO cloud sightings in recent UK history occurred in London in 2021. Witnesses described seeing a disc-shaped cloud hovering over the skyline, with its smooth, circular edges resembling the classic depiction of a UFO. The cloud was observed in broad daylight, and although it did not move in a manner that suggested it was a flying object, the perfectly symmetrical shape led many onlookers to wonder if it was an optical illusion caused by a UFO. Eyewitnesses also noted that the cloud appeared to glow faintly in the light, further enhancing its surreal and otherworldly presence.\n\nSeveral UFO researchers quickly jumped on the case, suggesting that the cloud could be linked to some form of atmospheric disturbance created by a UFO. Meteorologists, however, suggested that the cloud could have been a rare lenticular cloud, which can form in circular shapes under specific atmospheric conditions, especially near mountain ranges or strong wind currents. Still, the resemblance to the saucer-shaped craft often seen in UFO sightings was too uncanny to ignore, and the event gained significant attention on social media.\n\nUFO Cloud Sightings in Scotland\u2019s Highlands\n\nIn Scotland, particularly in the remote Highlands, there have been increasing reports of mysterious cloud formations that coincide with UFO sightings. In 2020, a group of hikers in the Cairngorms National Park described seeing unusual cloud structures in the sky, which they believed were connected to a UFO. The clouds were described as massive, elongated formations that appeared to \"move\" in strange patterns, with some observers even reporting that the clouds seemed to change shape rapidly, as if they were being manipulated by a force beyond the natural elements.\n\nSome locals in rural parts of Scotland have long been proponents of the idea that the area\u2019s isolation and its connection to ancient folklore might attract UFOs or otherworldly visitors. These recent cloud sightings, coupled with ongoing UFO reports, have only strengthened these theories. The belief that UFOs use the clouds as a form of camouflage or as a by-product of their energy emissions has found fertile ground in these remote communities.\n\nStrange Clouds Over Manchester\n\nIn late 2022, Manchester, a bustling urban centre in the north of England, became the site of another mysterious cloud sighting. Several witnesses reported seeing a dark, swirling cloud that appeared to hover for an unusually long period above the city. The cloud was said to take on an amorphous, disc-like form before dissipating into the sky without any clear explanation.\n\nWhat made this sighting particularly intriguing was the concurrent UFO sighting reported by a resident just hours before. According to the witness, they saw a series of bright lights darting across the sky, followed by the sudden appearance of the swirling cloud. Some speculated that the cloud might have been a side effect of the UFO\u2019s propulsion system, or that the lights and cloud were linked in some way. A few local news outlets picked up the story, with experts offering both mundane meteorological explanations and more speculative theories involving extraterrestrial phenomena.\n\nThe Connection Between UFOs and Clouds in the UK\n\nThe recent spate of UFO cloud sightings over the UK has led some to wonder whether there is a pattern connecting these unusual formations to extraterrestrial activity. The country has seen a notable uptick in UFO reports over the past decade, with several credible witnesses\u2014ranging from military personnel to ordinary citizens\u2014describing sightings of strange lights or unidentified craft in the sky.\n\nSome UFO enthusiasts and researchers argue that the unusual clouds could be camouflage for UFOs, a way for extraterrestrial craft to hide their presence in plain sight. According to this theory, UFOs might create or manipulate cloud formations in such a way as to remain undetected by conventional observation, blending in with the natural weather patterns.\n\nOthers speculate that these clouds may be linked to atmospheric anomalies created by UFO propulsion systems. Some UFOs, especially those described as \"saucer-shaped\", are often associated with electromagnetic or plasma-based propulsion methods. According to proponents of this theory, the interaction between the craft\u2019s energy field and the surrounding atmosphere could lead to the formation of oddly shaped clouds, which could be mistaken for a natural weather phenomenon.\n\nAdditionally, it's possible that the rise in sightings of UFO clouds is simply a result of heightened public awareness and media coverage of UFO phenomena. As UFOs and related sightings become a more widely discussed topic\u2014thanks in part to government disclosures and the release of previously classified reports\u2014more people may be looking at the sky with a more discerning eye, noticing unusual cloud formations that they might have otherwise overlooked.\n\nScientific and Meteorological Explanations\n\nOf course, there are scientific explanations for most of these strange cloud sightings. As mentioned earlier, lenticular clouds and roll clouds are two of the most commonly misidentified formations. Both types of clouds have a characteristic shape that can resemble UFOs or discs, particularly when seen from certain angles or under specific lighting conditions.\n\nMeteorologists also point out that some weather systems\u2014such as cold fronts or warm air surges\u2014can produce clouds that appear to behave in unusual ways, such as hanging low in the sky or shifting shape rapidly. Such phenomena could be responsible for some of the recent reports in the UK, especially those involving swirling, elongated clouds.\n\nTypes of UFO Clouds\n\nThough no official meteorological classification exists for UFO clouds, several specific types of cloud formations have become associated with UFO phenomena. These clouds share certain characteristics, which make them seem out of place or highly unusual. Here are some of the most common types:\n\n1. Lenticular Clouds\n\nLenticular clouds are large, lens-shaped clouds that often form over mountains or other elevated terrain. These clouds are typically stationary and can take on a disc-like appearance, which has led many to speculate that they are associated with UFOs. Lenticular clouds are formed when air flows over a mountain range, creating a standing wave of air. As the air moves upward and cools, it condenses into a cloud, and its shape can appear very similar to a saucer or disc.\n\nLenticular clouds are commonly mistaken for UFOs because of their smooth, distinct shape, and they often appear to hover in the sky. While these clouds are completely natural and can be explained by atmospheric science, their resemblance to UFOs has contributed to numerous sightings and theories about extraterrestrial activity.\n\n2. Roll Clouds\n\nA roll cloud is a type of low, horizontal cloud that can appear to \"roll\" across the sky, giving it a cylindrical appearance. These clouds are usually associated with storm fronts and can stretch for hundreds of miles. Although roll clouds are a well-known meteorological phenomenon, their long, uniform shape and movement can create an eerie or otherworldly effect. In some cases, roll clouds have been reported in conjunction with UFO sightings, and their unusual, rolling motion has led to speculation that they may be linked to alien technology or atmospheric anomalies caused by UFOs.\n\n3. Mammatus Clouds\n\nMammatus clouds are puffy, balloon-like formations that typically appear beneath the base of a thunderstorm cloud. They often create a striking and somewhat ominous visual effect, with their bulbous, sagging appearance giving them a surreal, otherworldly quality. While mammatus clouds are associated with intense thunderstorms, their strange shape and eerie nature have caused some to connect them with UFOs or extraterrestrial activity. The clouds' unusual appearance, particularly when seen in isolation or during an otherwise calm period, can evoke images of hovering ships or alien craft, leading to UFO-related speculation.\n\n4. Noctilucent Clouds\n\nNoctilucent clouds are high-altitude clouds that are most visible during the summer months, especially at latitudes between 50 and 70 degrees north and south. These clouds form in the mesosphere, far higher than typical clouds, and they glow with an eerie, blue or silver light after sunset. While the phenomenon can be explained by the reflection of sunlight on ice crystals in the clouds, the unusual, glowing nature of noctilucent clouds has led to various UFO-related theories. Their ethereal glow and unusual location in the atmosphere have given rise to questions about whether they might be linked to extraterrestrial activity or even serve as a cover for UFOs.\n\nUFO Clouds and the UFO Phenomenon\n\nThe connection between UFO clouds and UFO sightings is a subject of intense fascination for both UFO enthusiasts and meteorologists. Some individuals claim that certain UFO clouds are associated with UFO activity, suggesting that the clouds might be a type of camouflage or atmospheric distortion created by alien spacecraft. Others believe that UFOs themselves may be responsible for the formation of these clouds, either as a result of the energy they emit or the atmospheric disturbances they cause.\n\nOne of the most notable cases linking UFOs to clouds occurred in 1957, when several people reported seeing a UFO hovering above a strange cloud formation over the Pacific Northwest in the United States. The object was described as disc-shaped, and the cloud that formed underneath it appeared to be perfectly round, prompting some to believe that the cloud was the result of the UFO\u2019s activity. Since then, similar reports of UFO sightings coinciding with unusual cloud formations have been documented, further cementing the idea that there may be a connection.\n\nScientific Explanations vs. Extraterrestrial Theories\n\nWhile UFO clouds are often seen as evidence of alien involvement in atmospheric phenomena, there are more grounded scientific explanations for these unusual cloud formations. Meteorologists argue that many of the clouds associated with UFO sightings are simply natural occurrences. Lenticular clouds, roll clouds, and mammatus clouds are all well-documented and have clear meteorological explanations that do not require the involvement of extraterrestrial beings.\n\nHowever, the mystique of UFOs and the possibility of alien life continues to captivate the human imagination. For many, the idea that UFOs might be responsible for certain cloud formations provides a compelling narrative that fits within the broader framework of UFO lore. The persistent sightings of these clouds, combined with the belief in extraterrestrial visitation, means that UFO clouds will likely continue to fuel theories and debates for years to come.\n\nConclusion: A Continued Mystery\n\nThe recent sightings of UFO clouds in the UK serve to deepen the mystery surrounding both unidentified flying objects and the enigmatic nature of cloud formations. While scientific explanations are readily available, the persistent association of these unusual clouds with UFO sightings continues to fuel the debate about extraterrestrial involvement.\n\nAs UFO sightings remain a popular subject of fascination for many, it seems likely that these strange, disc-shaped clouds and anomalous weather phenomena will continue to spark curiosity. Whether they are merely natural atmospheric events or signs of something more profound remains a question that has yet to be definitively answered. For now, the skies above the UK\u2014and the mysterious clouds within them\u2014remain a captivating enigma."

            "article_content": "In a dramatic development on Thursday, SpaceX's Starship rocket mission ended abruptly when the spacecraft exploded minutes after launch from Texas. The incident, which involved an upgraded Starship carrying a test payload, prompted airlines to reroute flights over the Gulf of Mexico as debris scattered, marking a setback for Elon Musk's rocket program. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, in coordination with Turks and Caicos officials, is investigating the fallout, though no injuries have been reported.\n\nIn Belgium, scientist Clement Martin is collaborating with federal police to create a groundbreaking scent mimicking the smell of dried bones, helping sniffer dogs locate long-missing remains. This innovation follows Martin's earlier work isolating the scent of decomposing flesh, now essential in training cadaver dogs across Belgium.\n\nMeanwhile, archaeological explorations in Pompeii have uncovered an opulent private bath complex, providing insights into the affluent lifestyle of the Romans before the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The newly unearthed site features hot, warm, and cold baths that could accommodate up to 30 guests, adorned with Greek mythological themes, showcasing the luxury of that era.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "I\u2019m a fan of the Marvel movies. Not just for the action and the effects, but perhaps even more so for the clever dialogue between characters. I find the writers and actors witty and brilliant.\n\nIn one of the Antman movies, the hero Scott Lang is being lectured on how he became the Antman. After the confusing diatribe from the physicists who created his Antman suit, he frustratingly asks \u201cDo you guys just put the word 'quantum' in front of everything.\u201d Well for the past couple months, stock investors have doing just that.\n\nAs seemingly quickly as the investment excitement surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology came into the financial market landscape, the hype around quantum computing has come on even faster. While AI may be the secret technology sauce of the current stock market rally, those focused on quantum computing believe this technology may soon take up the leadership mantle. While I am certainly not convinced, I don\u2019t think this topic is going away, so I thought we might cover some basics in the column.\n\nLike the Antman movie dialogue indicates, the subject of quantum computing is confusing. The terms used to discuss it are technical and most of the talk quickly breaks down into the jargon from a master level physics textbook. I will do my best to avoid this technical jargon here, so I may also be off on some of my accuracy for our true physicists' readers. Feel free to educate me, the rest of you stay with me.\n\nThe word quantum in its simplest form is used to describe processes or interactions occurring on a very small scale. Not small like microscopic, but rather small like subatomic. So small the processes are considered almost \u201cfundamental\u201d in that they are the most basic interactions between energy and matter. Processes at this fundamental level occur in different contexts of time and reality. Despite attempting to build technology used to harness these processes, they are not yet completely understood by physics.\n\nBecause quantum processes occur in different contexts of time, the opportunity to harness them with technology has become the focus of researchers. Developers of quantum computers promote the technology as a way to solve extremely complex mathematical equations and challenges in fractions of the time it would take for classical computing models (including AI). This speed would enable quantum computers to increase the computational potential of the planet by an incomprehensible magnitude.\n\nThis type of computing power has the capacity to be used to solve many complex problems. One positive example coming to mind for me, is perhaps the ability to accurately model long term global climate trends, a feat not yet been possible with current technology.\n\nThere are negative examples as well, as it is believed a true quantum computer could break any current computer security encryption within a matter of milliseconds. The financial and national security ramifications of which are terrifying.\n\nQuantum technology is still primarily in the theoretical stage. I am only aware of two companies claiming to have built a machine based on quantum technology, Google and IBM. The basic form of quantum information interaction, called the qubit (I promise no more jargon) are unstable and require incredible amounts of energy to isolate and contain. Any interference present in this process tends to break down the qubit into a state of incoherence. It's mind-boggling stuff.\n\nSome of the immense technological challenges, however, have not deterred a host of companies from pursuing development and commercialization of quantum technology. In November and December of 2024 this niche of the stock market ignited, and many \u201cquantum\u201d stocks rallied, drawing attention to this subsector of the market.\n\nUnlike the development of AI, which has been heavily dominated by giant mega-cap technology companies, quantum computing opportunities look to be more broadly spread among mid-sized companies and even start-ups. While the debate is raging about how soon quantum technology may provide commercially viable applications, with claims ranging from later this year to 15 to 20 years, I think it is clear the topic of investment possibilities in quantum computing is likely here to stay.\n\nWhile investors may not be early at this point, this topic and the companies developing this technology are certainly worth further exploration and research."

            "article_content": "The quantum computing revolution is changing technology as we know it. Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations far beyond the capabilities of traditional computers.\n\nThis transformative technology has the potential to revolutionize diverse sectors, including medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence (AI). Underscoring this point, a recent McKinsey & Co. research report projects that quantum computing could generate a whopping $1.3 trillion in economic value by 2035.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nJust as the internet boom created giants like Amazon and Google, quantum computing could give rise to a new generation of industry-leading companies, offering early investors the potential for extraordinary gains. Imagine a future with personalized medicines, revolutionary materials, and supercharged AI -- all made possible by quantum computing.\n\nLet's take a closer look at two quantum computing stocks that could represent once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for early shareholders.\n\nTrapped-ion quantum computing leader\n\nIonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is emerging as a potential leader in the commercialization of quantum computing through its trapped-ion technology approach. Unlike traditional superconducting quantum competitors, IonQ's architecture operates at room temperature and demonstrates strong qubit connectivity, with the company's Forte system delivering 36 algorithmic qubits at 99.9% fidelity -- marking significant performance advantages that could translate into a formidable competitive moat as the technology matures.\n\nWhile some quantum computing companies focus on the number of physical qubits, IonQ uses \"algorithmic qubits\" to represent the computational power available after accounting for error correction and other factors that affect algorithm performance. This metric aims to provide a more practical measure of a quantum computer's ability to solve real-world problems.\n\nBeyond the core technology, IonQ's execution has been notable. The company has consistently beaten aggressive roadmap timelines, secured a major $54.5M Air Force Research Lab contract, and established partnerships with heavyweights like pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and engineering simulation software leader Ansys.\n\nWhile quantum computing stocks are notoriously speculative, IonQ's manufacturing facility opening and modular multicore architecture as a potential path to scaling suggest the company has a credible shot at capturing a meaningful share of the vast and potentially unparalleled quantum computing market.\n\nStory Continues"
