In a playful tweet, McGregor expressed his thoughts on the influx of UFO reports, calling it \u201cpretty cool.\u201d\n\nConor McGregor on UFO\u2019s\n\nConor McGregor said:\n\n\u201cPretty cool to see ufo\u2019s rocking around freely now. Kang and Kodos shortly, The Simpsons predicted it. The lads were alright. #Kang #Kodos\u201c\n\nConor McGregor\u2019s comment comes amidst an uptick in UFO sightings, including several in the UK and the US in recent weeks. From November 20 to 22, 2024, drones were spotted hovering over multiple Royal Air Force (RAF) bases in the UK, including RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell, which are crucial to the US Air Force\u2019s operations.\n\nRecent UAP and UFO Sightings\n\nThese sightings occurred while preparations were underway for RAF Lakenheath\u2019s nuclear mission, prompting concerns about potential surveillance from foreign adversaries. The UK Ministry of Defence has maintained its stance on UAPs, stating that it has not investigated such reports since 2009 and that no UAP sightings have indicated any military threat to the UK.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, similar reports have emerged in Somerset County, New Jersey, where residents reported multiple sightings of unidentified objects in early December 2024. These incidents are part of a broader pattern of UAP sightings near US military and nuclear facilities.\n\nIn the UK, Manchester Airport recently faced a media frenzy after images and videos of a purported UFO appeared on social media, allegedly showing a spherical object. However, airport officials dismissed the claims, asserting that the footage was likely fake and that their security systems would have flagged any legitimate threat.\n\nAs Conor McGregor\u2019s comment highlights, whether you believe in extraterrestrial life or not, the mystery surrounding UFOs shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon."

            "article_content": "MIT Technology Review got to try out Astra in a closed-door live demo last week. It was a stunning experience, but there\u2019s a gulf between polished promo and live demo.\n\nAstra uses Gemini 2.0\u2019s built-in agent framework to answer questions and carry out tasks via text, speech, image, and video, calling up existing Google apps like Search, Maps, and Lens when it needs to. \u201cIt\u2019s merging together some of the most powerful information retrieval systems of our time,\u201d says Bibo Xu, product manager for Astra.\n\nGemini 2.0 and Astra are joined by Mariner, a new agent built on top of Gemini that can browse the web for you; Jules, a new Gemini-powered coding assistant; and Gemini for Games, an experimental assistant that you can chat to and ask for tips as you play video games.\n\n(And let\u2019s not forget that in the last week Google DeepMind also announced Veo, a new video generation model; Imagen 3, a new version of its image generation model; and Willow, a new kind of chip for quantum computers. Whew. Meanwhile, CEO Demis Hassabis was in Sweden yesterday receiving his Nobel Prize.)\n\nGoogle DeepMind claims that Gemini 2.0 is twice as fast as the previous version, Gemini 1.5, and outperforms it on a number of standard benchmarks, including MMLU-Pro, a large set of multiple-choice questions designed to test the abilities of large language models across a range of subjects, from math and physics to health, psychology, and philosophy.\n\nBut the margins between top-end models like Gemini 2.0 and those from rival labs like OpenAI and Anthropic are now slim. These days, advances in large language models are less about how good they are and more about what you can do with them.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where agents come in.\n\nHands on with Project Astra\n\nLast week I was taken through an unmarked door on an upper floor of a building in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross district into a room with strong secret-project vibes. The word \u201cASTRA\u201d was emblazoned in giant letters across one wall. Xu\u2019s dog, Charlie, the project\u2019s de facto mascot, roamed between desks where researchers and engineers were busy building a product that Google is betting its future on."

            "article_content": "Opinion: superstitions like crossing your fingers or throwing spilled salt over your shoulder can have a powerful impact on your emotions\n\nBy Kylie Sturgess, Murdoch University\n\nOf all the days to stay in bed, Friday the 13th is surely the best. It\u2019s the title of a popular (if increasingly corny) horror movie series; it\u2019s associated with bad luck and it\u2019s generally thought to be a good time not to take any serious risks.\n\nEven if you try to escape it, you might fail, as happened to New Yorker Daz Baxter. On Friday 13th in 1976, he decided to just stay in bed for the day, only to be killed when the floor of his apartment block collapsed under him. There\u2019s even a term for the terror the day evokes: Paraskevidekatriaphobia was coined by the psychotherapist Donald Dossey, a specialist in phobias, to describe an intense and irrational fear of the date.\n\nUnfortunately there is always one Friday 13th in a year, and sometimes there are as many as three. But no matter how many times the masked killer Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th returns to haunt our screens, this fear is in our own minds rather than any basis in science.\n\nWe need your consent to load this YouTube contentWe use YouTube to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

Follow-up research found no consistent evidence of a rise in accidents on the day, but suggested that if you\u2019re superstitious, it might be better not get behind the wheel of a car on it anyway.\n\nThe stigma against Friday 13th likely comes from a merging of two different superstitions. In the Christian tradition, the death of Jesus took place on a Friday, following the presence of 13 people at the Last Supper. In Teutonic legend, the god Loki appears at a dinner party seated for 12 gods, making him the outcast 13th at the table, leading to the death of another guest.\n\n13 was certainly unlucky number for Jesus. Leonardo da Vinci, The Last Supper, 1498. Wikimedia\n\nElsewhere in the world, 13 is less unlucky. In Hinduism, people fast to worship Lord Shiva and Parvati on Trayodashi, the 13th day in Hindu month. There are 13 Buddhas in the Shingon sect of Buddhism, and there is mention of a lucky 13 signs, rather than unlucky, in The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation.\n\nIn Italy, it is more likely to be \"heptadecaphobia\", or fear of the number 17, that leads to a change of plans. In Greece, Spain, and Mexico, the \"unlucky\" day is not Friday 13th, but Tuesday 13th.\n\nIn China, the number four is considered significantly unlucky, as it is nearly homophonous to the word \"death\". In a multicultural country like Australia you may find hotels and cinemas missing both 13th and fourth floors, out of respect for the trepidation people can have about those numbers.\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

While many are now just social customs rather than a genuine conviction, their persistence is remarkable.\n\nIf you cross your fingers, feel alarmed at breaking a mirror, find a \"lucky\" horseshoe or throw spilled salt over your shoulder, you are engaging in long-held practices that can have a powerful impact on your emotions. Likewise, many students are now heading towards their semester exams. In the lecture rooms, they may take lucky charms such as a particular pen or favourite socks.\n\nIn sports, baseballer Nomar Garciaparra is known for his elaborate batting ritual. Other sports people wear \"lucky gear\" or put on their gloves in a particular order. The great cricket umpire David Shepherd stood on one leg whenever the score reached 111. These sorts of superstitions are humorously depicted in the film Silver Linings Playbook. It\u2019s interesting to note that it\u2019s often the successful athletes who have these superstitions and stick to them.\n\nLucky charms can make you feel good. Shutterstock.com\n\nOne key reason for the persistence of superstition is a psychological concept called a \"discriminative stimulus\". An example of this is the gambler who notices he always seem to win when betting on \"lucky 7\", and forgets all the times that same number has not been in his favour.\n\nCharms do work in a fashion. If you wear your lucky underwear and succeed enough, you will feel distress that actually impedes your performance if you\u2019re not wearing them. This then influences your performance \u2013 an \"A\" seems guaranteed because you walk in fully prepared.\n\nBut if you\u2019re feeling a little anxious this Friday, try to remember there\u2019s nothing different about it to any other day.\n\nFollow RT\u00c9 Brainstorm on WhatsApp and Instagram for more stories and updates\n\nKylie Sturgess is a tutor and researcher in Radio Broadcasting at Murdoch University.

The real driving force in Dandadan is Okarun\u2019s quest to get his testicles back, which were stolen from him by the Yokai Turbo Granny. Yes, you read that right, Dandadan spends a lot of time focused on a teen boy\u2019s nutsack.\n\nAs you can probably imagine then, this is a show that doesn\u2019t take itself very seriously, and as you\u2019d expect, it\u2019s very funny and full of action. It\u2019s classic shonen stuff, really. Yet every now and again, Dandadan will blindside you with an episode that\u2019s so heartbreaking you\u2019ll be left an emotional wreck by the time it ends.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nAcrobatic Silky\n\nCrunchyroll\n\nIn fact, one episode in particular is so good that fans have already labeled it the best in the series. I\u2019m talking, of course, about Episode 7, titled \u2018To A Kinder World\u2019. This genuinely harrowing chapter sees Momo and Okarun battle the terrifying Acrobatic Silky, a powerful Yokai with designs on their school friend, Aira Shiratori.\n\nYet the episode takes a tragic turn when, during the battle, Aira dies, and Acrobatic Silky decides to sacrifice her own aura to the teenager to save her life. During the transfer, the audience gets to see a flashback to Acrobatic Silky\u2019s human life and what drove her to become a vengeful spirit in the afterlife.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nSilky, it turns out, was a poor single mom struggling to keep her head above water. To provide for her daughter, she turned to prostitution and loan sharks, which allowed her to give her child a happy life. One day, however, rather than paying the loan sharks back, she bought her daughter a pretty dress, and let\u2019s just say the criminals who lent her the money weren\u2019t pleased with her.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIn one of the most triggering scenes I\u2019ve ever watched, the loan sharks beat Silky half to death and kidnap her daughter. Silky gave chase, but she was so grievously wounded that she died (or took her own life, it\u2019s a bit unclear), never finding out what happened to her beloved little girl.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nFor years, she wandered Tokyo as a ghost until a fateful encounter with Aira transformed her into the fearsome Yokai we know and love.\n\nMummy?\n\nCrunchyroll\n\nAs the transfer finishes, Silky starts to break apart, dying once again. This time, however, there will be no afterlife; if a ghost dies without completing its unfinished business, it simply ceases to be. However, before Silky goes into the void, Aira steps up and hugs the Yokai, thanking her and calling her mommy.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nThis brief act of kindness convinces Silky she is a good mother after all, and it counts as her completing her unfinished business so she can go to a kinder world. It\u2019s heart-wrenching stuff and on a level with some of the saddest scenes ever seen on TV.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising then that fans love it, and a quick search of Episode 7 will bring up countless posts and comments lauding the episode for its gorgeous animation, beautiful storytelling, and heart-rending final moments.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nThis isn\u2019t just Redditor group think either; on IMDb, it\u2019s Dandadan\u2019s highest-rated episode with a score of 9.7, the same score as all-time classics like The Soprano\u2019s \u2018Pine Barrens\u2019 and \u2018The One Where Everyone Finds Out\u2019 from Friends.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not checked out Dandadan, maybe do yourself a favor and just get up to Episode 7 \u2013 you won\u2019t be disappointed.

            "article_content": "There are certain sequences in horror that affect moviegoers for years, even decades. Seeing the first Crawler in The Descent or the red-faced demon in Insidious gave viewers such a fright, it might still rattle them to this day even if they haven't watched the film in years.\n\nWith that in mind, horror veterans should be excited (and a little anxious) to learn the genre has a whole new batch of defining moments thanks to 2024's stacked roster. The year had something for everybody, including slashers, creature features, paranormal sagas, original IPs, potentially new franchises, long-awaited sequels, and a few unneeded but surprisingly solid prequels.\n\nThough several of these movies captivated the masses from beginning to end, one or two moments did something truly special, allowing them to leave a lasting impression. Sure, these entries contained hard-hitting stories and thought-provoking characters, but it's those jaw-dropping twists, creative deaths, nightmarish jump-scares, and WTF endings that stand the test of time.\n\nWhether these moments lasted an entire scene or less than a second, none of them will be forgotten anytime soon."

Roller coasters that will leave you hoarse from screaming. It might not sound like the makings of a relaxing holiday, but we\u2019ve ranked 30 of the world\u2019s most terrifying attractions \u2013 guaranteed to thrill adrenaline junkies and horror fans alike. You have been warned.\n\nRead on to discover our ranking of the world's most terrifying attractions...\n\n30. The Skywalk at the Dachstein Glacier, Germany\n\nmarcos alvarado/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThe Skywalk is a vertigo-inducing viewing platform made almost entirely of glass, suspended directly above the 820-foot (250m) sheer rock face of the Hunerkogel mountain region. This unique vantage point offers some of the most beautiful views in the Alps \u2013 on a clear day, travellers can see as far as Slovenia and Czechia. While it may look fragile, The Skywalk is anything but: the steel-reinforced structure is built to endure winds of up to 130 miles per hour (210km/h) and support up to 26 feet (8m) of heavy snowfall.\n\n29. The Winchester Mystery House, California, USA\n\nUladzik Kryhin/Shutterstock\n\nBehind the beautiful exterior of the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California, lies a seriously spooky history that has led many to declare it America\u2019s most haunted property. Built by eccentric \u2018cursed widow\u2019 Sarah Winchester between 1884 and 1922, this 160-room mansion features 2,000 doors, 10,000 windows, a \u2018seance room\u2019 and countless instances of paranormal activity and chilling ghost sightings. You can tour the mansion all year round, but it\u2019s best explored by flashlight, after-hours.\n\n28. Gomantong Caves, Borneo, Malaysia\n\nYusnizam Yusof/Shutterstock\n\nClaustrophobes, look away now. Got a fear of insects? Stay away too. The Gomantong Caves are a popular stop on the Malaysian Borneo tourist trail, but they\u2019re also home to hundreds of thousands of wildlife, including bats, cockroaches, spiders, scorpions and giant centipedes, all of whom litter the floors and damp, mossy walls. The takeaway? Covered shoes and a hat are essential, as is a mask \u2013 the smell, mostly bat and bird excrement, is pungent.\n\n27. Catacombs of Paris, France\n\nAndrea Izzotti/Shutterstock\n\nHidden deep underneath the City of Love lies one of the world\u2019s most macabre attractions: an ossuary, or resting place for human remains. This labyrinth of tunnels contains the bones of over six million bodies, moved there in 1786 due to overcrowding in the city\u2019s graveyards and cemeteries. Incredibly, the catacombs are roughly the depth of a five-storey building, and while they stretch for over 150 miles (240km), visitors can only explore around a mile of them. What makes the catacombs so unique is their design: the bones and skulls are artfully arranged into beautiful structures, and the tunnels also contain sculptures and other artworks.\n\n26. Red Force Roller Coaster, Spain\n\nPanagiotis Kotsovolos/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nRed Force, Europe\u2019s fastest and highest roller coaster, accelerates from 0 to 110 miles per hour (177km/h) in a staggering five seconds. Part of the Ferrari Land theme park, which opened in 2017, the ride was designed to give Formula One fans a taste of what it\u2019s like to be Lewis Hamilton et al, as they experience a hair-raising G force of 1.35. Costing an estimated \u00a380m ($101.9m) Red Force is unsurprisingly high-tech, using magnetic launch technology in its acceleration.\n\n25. Port Arthur, Tasmania, Australia\n\nJEONA/Shutterstock\n\nPort Arthur, on the Australian island state of Tasmania, has an incredibly dark and storied history. The site of Australia\u2019s largest penal colony in the 18th and 19th centuries, with up to 14,000 convicts passing through or living there, it has a tragic recent history too, with the country\u2019s biggest mass shooting taking place at Port Arthur in 1996. Nowadays it\u2019s a popular historic attraction, including the eerie \u2018Isle of the Dead\u2019, where more than 1,000 convicts and their families lie buried.\n\n24. Felicitas Slate Mine, Germany\n\nHolger Von Both/Shutterstock\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get much creepier than an abandoned mine \u2013 particularly one that\u2019s completely underwater. Located 96 miles (156km) east of Dusseldorf, Germany, is the Felicitas Slate Mine, opened in 1886 but shut down and purposely flooded in 1997. Since then it\u2019s been abandoned, but is popular with divers in search of an eerie experience \u2013 with old machinery, discarded cables and even a small chapel still visible under the water in the darkness. Understandably, exploring the area is reserved for divers with a cave or mine certification, but tours run year round.\n\n23. Hanging Coffins of Sagada, Philippines\n\nMatyas Rehak/Shutterstock\n\nIn the quiet village of Sagada in the Cordillera Mountains of northern Luzon, visitors encounter a haunting yet fascinating sight: hundreds of hand-carved coffins suspended from cliffs. This ancient burial tradition, practiced for over 2,000 years by the Igorot people, reflects their belief that placing the deceased high up brings them closer to ancestral spirits and the afterlife. Some of the coffins are more than a century old, and while rare today, this unique tradition remains a powerful testament to the region\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\n22. Superman: Escape from Krypton, California, USA\n\nCalifornia Dreamin/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nKingda Ka, once the world\u2019s fastest and tallest roller coaster, was officially retired in November 2024. Enter Superman: Escape from Krypton, a record-breaking thrill ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. Standing at 415 feet (126.5m) tall, this ride launches passengers in reverse, accelerating from 0 to 100 miles per hour (160km/h) in just seven seconds. Riders then ascend vertically at a 90-degree angle before plunging back down at speeds of 92 miles per hour (148km/h).\n\n21. Yungas Road, Bolivia\n\nDEPLANQUE JOEL/Shutterstock\n\nCommonly known as \u2018The Death Road\u2019, the North Yungas Road has frequently been called the world\u2019s most dangerous drive. Stretching 40 miles (64km) through rural Bolivia \u2013 linking the capital city of La Paz to the Amazon Rainforest \u2013 it\u2019s infamous for its sheer, vertical 11,000-foot drop (3,500m) that claimed the lives of hundreds of motorists and passengers in the 1990s. Now mostly used by cyclists, parts of the Yungas Road are a miniscule 10 foot (3m) wide, while the entire route is dotted with memorials and crosses dedicated to the dead.\n\n20. Defiance Roller Coaster, Colorado, USA\n\nGlenwood Caverns Adventure Park/Todd Patrick\n\nSitting atop Iron Mountain at Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park in Colorado, Defiance stands an impressive 7,132 feet (2,173m) above sea level, making it the highest and steepest looping roller coaster in the United States. It features a thrilling 102.3-degree freefall and a 75-foot (22m) vertical lift hill, before plunging riders at high speed into a ravine with epic views of the Colorado River. Opened in 2021, the ride lasts just 56 seconds, but you\u2019ll be screaming for every single one of them.\n\n19. Titlis Cliff Walk, Switzerland\n\nTitlis Cliff Walk\n\nSnow and ski enthusiasts alike will be dazzled by the Titlis Cliff Walk, one of Europe\u2019s highest suspension bridges. With snowy vistas visible from every angle, the bridge hangs between two rock faces, and intrepid visitors walk the 328-foot (100m) length of it with a 1,640-foot (500m) chasm unfolding beneath their feet. Once they reach the end, they can step onto the Ice Flyer glacier chair lift for a more serene end to the experience.\n\n18. Arouca Bridge, Portugal\n\nlone wolf7/Shutterstock\n\nThe Arouca Bridge, the world\u2019s longest pedestrian suspension bridge, may be sturdy and very new \u2013 having only opened in 2021 \u2013 but it\u2019s still anxiety-inducing to cross. Suspended 574 feet (175m) above the Paiva River in Portugal\u2019s Arouca UNESCO Global Geopark, the bridge stretches an astounding 1,693 feet (516m), connecting the stunning Aguieiras Waterfall and Paiva Gorge. Inspired by ancient Tibetan footbridges, its metal grid floor and railings offer a breathtaking (and nerve-wracking) 360-degree view of the dramatic scenery below.\n\n17. The Darvaza Crater, Turkmenistan\n\nMatyas Rehak/Shutterstock\n\nDeep in Turkmenistan\u2019s Karakum Desert is a massive, burning gas crater of unknown origin: the aptly named \u2018Gateway to Hell\u2019. Geologists disagree as to how the hole was formed \u2013 while some believe it was a freak natural phenomenon, others say it was accidentally created by the Soviet Union in the 1960s while they drilled for oil. Either way, it\u2019s still burning more than half a century later \u2013 and is one of the country\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, with people flocking from all over the world to marvel at the seemingly eternal flames.\n\n16. \u00der\u00edhn\u00fakag\u00edgur volcano, Iceland\n\nNature Picture Library/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nVolcanoes are among the most terrifying things on Earth to witness \u2013 let alone climb inside. But that\u2019s exactly what Iceland\u2019s \u2018Inside the Volcano\u2019 experience offers intrepid tourists. Named as \u2018one of 20 places in the world you must see\u2019 by CNN, the dormant \u00der\u00edhn\u00fakag\u00edgur volcano is the only accessible lava chamber on Earth. Participants begin by hiking two miles (3km) to the summit, before descending 400 feet (120m) into the volcano via an open cable lift, operated by mountaineers.\n\n15. Al-Ula Old Town, Saudi Arabia\n\ncorkscrew/Shutterstock\n\nEqual parts creepy and fascinating, the abandoned Al-Ula Old Town is an ancient time capsule. Frozen in time since the 1980s, when the last few residents left for a nearby town, Al-Ula\u2019s winding pathways and once-bustling squares were a key route on the spice and silk roads, welcoming traders from all over the Middle East and Europe. However, travellers wanting to visit Al-Ula for its ghost-town-vibes should do so soon: it\u2019s currently undergoing careful redevelopment, and may not be abandoned for much longer.\n\n14. Kawah Ijen Volcano, Indonesia\n\nlkunl/Shutterstock\n\nOn the Indonesian island of Java lies the world\u2019s largest acidic lake, nestled within the crater of the Kawah Ijen Volcano. Measuring over half a mile wide (1km) and 656 feet (200m) deep, the lake's stunning turquoise colour is caused by high sulfuric acid levels. Recognised as part of a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve in 2016, Kawah Ijen remains an active volcano, with notable eruptions as recently as 2002. Visitors can trek along the crater\u2019s rim, taking in both its beauty and its geological power.\n\n13. Capuchin Catacombs, Italy\n\nBoaz Rottem/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nHidden in an unassuming monastery in Palermo, Sicily lie more than 1,000 mummified corpses \u2013 beautifully dressed in their best clothes. This is the Capuchin Catacombs where, unlike its Parisian counterpart, many of the bodies have been embalmed, some as recently as 1920. The largest collection of mummified remains in Europe, the Catacombs have fascinated and terrified tourists for decades. Originally, only Capuchin monks could be interned there, but it soon became a prestigious final resting place and was opened to the public.\n\n12. Nagoro, Japan\n\nretirementbonus/Shutterstock\n\nWhether you find this entry creepy or cute will depend on how you feel about scarecrows. Hidden deep in the valleys of Tokushima Prefecture on the Japanese island of Shikoku is a real-life \u2018Valley of the Dolls\u2019, where hundreds of handmade, life-size scarecrows outnumber humans 10-to-one. Why, you ask? With a permanent population of just 27, most of them elderly, crafts hobbyist Tsukimi Ayano decided to create scarecrow tributes to all of the past residents who have left the remote village. It now attracts more than 3,000 visitors every year.\n\n11. Cerro Negro, Nicaragua\n\nMario Chipev/Shutterstock\n\nThere\u2019s several volcanic attractions featured on this list \u2013 but none quite like Cerro Negro. It\u2019s become synonymous with \u2018volcano boarding\u2019, where hardcore adrenaline junkies take on the 2,388-foot (728m) descent strapped to a sandboard. They experience an almost completely vertical drop, and if that wasn\u2019t terrifying enough, the black-sand Cerro Negro volcano remains active, having erupted 23 times since its formation in 1850, with the last eruption occurring as recently as 1999.\n\n10. Eastern State Penitentiary, Pennsylvania, USA\n\nMarco Paradiso 4483/Shutterstock\n\nBuilt way back in 1829, Eastern State Penitentiary was once \u2018home\u2019 to notorious criminals like Al Capone. It\u2019s also thought to be one of USA\u2019s most haunted buildings, with past inmates and present visitors reporting footsteps, ghosts and shadows. Before finally shutting its doors in 1971, it was an overcrowded hellhole where inmates were locked in their cells for 23 hours a day \u2013 now, it\u2019s a popular destination where true crime and horror fans flock for spooky experiences and Halloween festivities, including nighttime tours.\n\n9. The Chinampas of Xochimilco, Mexico\n\nCassielMx/Shutterstock\n\nSouth of Mexico City is Xochimilco, home to the chinampas, ancient floating gardens filled with brightly coloured flowers that are also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But one of the Xochimilco islands is more nightmare fuel than beauty spot. Translating literally to \u2018island of the dolls\u2019, it\u2019s home to more than four thousand of them \u2013 many dishevelled and broken. Legend has it that after a young girl drowned in one of the chinampas in the 1950s, a local hermit, Julian Santana Barrera, began hanging dolls to ward off evil spirits \u2013 before drowning in the canal himself, leading many to consider the now uninhabited island haunted in the extreme.\n\n8. Mount Huashan, China\n\nflocu/Shutterstock\n\nAt its narrowest point, the path on Mount Huashan in China is just 11.8 inches (30cm) wide \u2013 the same as a standard ruler \u2013 earning it a reputation as \u2018the world\u2019s most dangerous hike\u2019. While rumours of 100+ deaths annually are likely unfounded, safety harnesses are now mandatory on the most treacherous sections. Giving a whole new meaning to the phrase \u2018walking the plank\u2019, part of the mountain\u2019s 700-year-old path is little more than rickety wooden slats, affixed to the cliffside by metal bolts. And with two-way traffic and a height of more than seven thousand feet (2,100m), it\u2019s no surprise that this six-hour trek leaves even experienced hikers hanging on for dear life.\n\n7. The Capuchin Crypt in Brno, Czechia\n\nAron M/Shutterstock\n\nThe third crypt on this list, and the creepiest, the Capuchin Crypt in Brno is the final resting place for more than two hundred 15th-and-16th-century friars and a handful of ordinary folk. Fascinating and horrifying visitors for more than 140 years, the dead are not preserved behind glass but lay prone, side-by-side, and tourists must navigate claustrophobic corridors to reach the crypt. Most chillingly, some of the mummies are said to have been accidentally buried alive.\n\n6. The Caminito del Rey, Spain\n\nLeonardo Ale Rocha/Shutterstock\n\nOnce known as \u2018the world\u2019s most dangerous walkway\u2019, Malaga\u2019s Caminito del Rey has shaken off its fearsome reputation in recent years, thanks to a \u00a32.3 million ($2.9m) renovation completed in 2015. Constructed in 1905, it\u2019s attached to the terrifyingly steep walls of the El Chorro gorge, and was originally used by construction workers as they transported materials to the Guadalhorce dam. Throughout the 20th century, it fell into disrepair, closing to the public in 2000 after five deaths in just two years. And while the Caminito Del Rey\u2019s paths may no longer be narrow and rickety (and all walkers must now wear hard hats), those with a fear of heights would be wise to steer clear.\n\n5. The Mummies of Guanajuato, Mexico\n\nDouglas Peebles Photography/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nGuanajuato is one of Mexico\u2019s most beautiful cities and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Less picturesque is one of its biggest tourist attractions, the Museo de las Momias, home to more than 100 mummified bodies, dating from the 18th and 19th centuries, standing shoulder to shoulder behind glass cases. Incredibly, these mummies are a vital source of income for the region \u2013 bringing in the second biggest revenue after property tax.\n\n4. X-Scream, Nevada, USA\n\nEThamPhoto/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nEverything is a little crazier in Las Vegas, and its roller coasters are no exception. Perched precariously at the very top of The STRAT Hotel & Casino, X-Scream dangles its terrified riders headfirst over the edge \u2013 staring down at a 866-foot (263m) sheer drop \u2013 before dragging them back time and again for more. Definitely the most petrifying (and unique) way to experience the world-famous Las Vegas Strip.\n\n3. Buddha's Hand at Gulong Canyon, China\n\nSipa US/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nFamous for going viral on TikTok, the Buddha\u2019s Hand sculpture is located in Qingyuan City, Guangdong Province \u2013 and has long captivated tourists in search of the ultimate selfie. At 66 feet long (20m) and 53 feet high (16m), those brave enough to climb the sculpture\u2019s narrow steps are rewarded with a breathtaking view. There\u2019s no harnesses or rails, but the Buddha\u2019s Hand does, thankfully, have a safety net underneath in case of trips or falls.\n\n2. Nevis Swing, New Zealand\n\njeremy sutton-hibbert/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nOften called \u2018the most famous swing in the world\u2019, Queenstown\u2019s Nevis Swing is nothing like you\u2019ve experienced at your local playground. Suspended 525 feet (160m) above the stunning Nevis River Valley, it boasts a massive 984-foot (300m) arc. Daredevils can choose to swing forwards, backwards or even \u2013 gulp \u2013 upside down, before being winched back onto the platform.\n\n1. EdgeWalk at the CN Tower, Ontario, Canada\n\nAssociated Press/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nGiving a whole new meaning to \u2018living life on the edge\u2019, our number one pick for the scariest tourist attraction in the world goes to Toronto\u2019s EdgeWalk. Those brave enough to take it on can experience the city from a height of 116 storeys \u2013 protected by nothing but a harness. The world\u2019s highest, full-circle, hands-free walking experience, thrill seekers spend 30 minutes strolling the Tower\u2019s five-foot-wide (1.5m) ledge, and can lean forward (or back, if so inclined) as they soak up breathtaking views of Lake Ontario.\n\nAmazing tourist attractions ruined by commercialisation"

            "article_content": "OpenAI has never revealed exactly which data it used to train Sora, its video-generating AI. But from the looks of it, at least some of the data might\u2019ve come from Twitch streams and walkthroughs of games.\n\nSora launched on Monday, and I\u2019ve been playing around with it for a bit (to the extent the capacity issues will allow). From a text prompt or image, Sora can generate up to 20-second-long videos in a range of aspect ratios and resolutions.\n\nWhen OpenAI first revealed Sora in February, it alluded to the fact that it trained the model on Minecraft videos. So, I wondered, what other video game playthroughs might be lurking in the training set?\n\nQuite a few, it seems.\n\nSora can generate a video of what\u2019s essentially a Super Mario Bros. clone (if a glitchy one):\n\nImage Credits:OpenAI\n\nIt can create gameplay footage of a first-person shooter that looks inspired by Call of Duty and Counter-Strike:\n\nImage Credits:OpenAI\n\nAnd it can spit out a clip showing an arcade fighter in the style of a \u201990s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle game:\n\nImage Credits:OpenAI\n\nSora also appears to have an understanding of what a Twitch stream should look like \u2014 implying that it\u2019s seen a few. Check out the screenshot below, which gets the broad strokes right:\n\nA screengrab of a video generated using Sora. Image Credits:OpenAI\n\nAnother noteworthy thing about the screenshot: It features the likeness of popular Twitch streamer Ra\u00fal \u00c1lvarez Genes, who goes by the name Auronplay \u2014 down to the tattoo on Genes\u2019 left forearm.\n\nAuronplay isn\u2019t the only Twitch streamer Sora seems to \u201cknow.\u201d It generated a video of a character similar in appearance (with some artistic liberties) to Imane Anys, better known as Pokimane.\n\nImage Credits:OpenAI\n\nGranted, I had to get creative with some of the prompts (e.g. \u201cItalian plumber game\u201d). OpenAI has implemented filtering to try to prevent Sora from generating clips depicting trademarked characters. Typing something like \u201cMortal Kombat 1 gameplay,\u201d for example, won\u2019t yield anything resembling the title.\n\nBut my tests suggest that game content may have found its way into Sora\u2019s training data.\n\nOpenAI has been cagey about where it gets training data from. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in March, OpenAI\u2019s then-CTO, Mira Murati, wouldn\u2019t outright deny that Sora was trained on YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook content. And in the tech specs for Sora, OpenAI acknowledged it used \u201cpublicly available\u201d data, along with licensed data from stock media libraries like Shutterstock, to develop Sora.\n\nOpenAI didn\u2019t initially respond to a request for comment. But shortly after this story was published, a PR rep said that they would \u201ccheck with the team.\u201d\n\nIf game content is indeed in Sora\u2019s training set, it could have legal implications \u2014 particularly if OpenAI builds more interactive experiences on top of Sora.\n\n\u201cCompanies that are training on unlicensed footage from video game playthroughs are running many risks,\u201d Joshua Weigensberg, an IP attorney at Pryor Cashman, told TechCrunch. \u201cTraining a generative AI model generally involves copying the training data. If that data is video playthroughs of games, it\u2019s overwhelmingly likely that copyrighted materials are being included in the training set.\u201d\n\nProbabilistic models\n\nGenerative AI models like Sora are probabilistic. Trained on a lot of data, they learn patterns in that data to make predictions \u2014 for example, that a person biting into a burger will leave a bite mark.\n\nThis is a useful property. It enables models to \u201clearn\u201d how the world works, to a degree, by observing it. But it can also be an Achilles\u2019 heel. When prompted in a specific way, models \u2014 many of which are trained on public web data \u2014 produce near-copies of their training examples.\n\nA sample from Sora. Image Credits:OpenAI\n\nThat has understandably displeased creators whose works have been swept up in training without their permission. An increasing number are seeking remedies through the court system.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI are currently being sued over allegedly allowing their AI tools to regurgitate licensed code. Three companies behind popular AI art apps, Midjourney, Runway, and Stability AI, are in the crosshairs of a case that accuses them of infringing on artists\u2019 rights. And major music labels have filed suit against two startups developing AI-powered song generators, Udio and Suno, of infringement.\n\nMany AI companies have long claimed fair use protections, asserting that their models create transformative \u2014 not plagiaristic \u2014 works. Suno makes the case, for example, that indiscriminate training is no different from a \u201ckid writing their own rock songs after listening to the genre.\u201d\n\nA sample from Sora. Image Credits:OpenAI\n\nBut there are certain unique considerations with game content, says Evan Everist, an attorney at Dorsey & Whitney specializing in copyright law.\n\n\u201cVideos of playthroughs involve at least two layers of copyright protection: the contents of the game as owned by the game developer, and the unique video created by the player or videographer capturing the player\u2019s experience,\u201d Everist told TechCrunch in an email. \u201cAnd for some games, there\u2019s a potential third layer of rights in the form of user-generated content appearing in software.\u201d\n\nEverist gave the example of Epic\u2019s Fortnite, which lets players create their own game maps and share them for others to use. A video of a playthrough of one of these maps would concern no fewer than three copyright holders, he said: (1) Epic, (2) the person using the map, and (3) the map\u2019s creator.\n\nA sample from Sora. Image Credits:OpenAI\n\n\u201cShould courts find copyright liability for training AI models, each of these copyright holders would be potential plaintiffs or licensing sources,\u201d Everist said. \u201cFor any developers training AI on such videos, the risk exposure is exponential.\u201d\n\nWeigensberg noted that games themselves have many \u201cprotectable\u201d elements, like proprietary textures, that a judge might consider in an IP suit. \u201cUnless these works have been properly licensed,\u201d he said, \u201ctraining on them may infringe.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch reached out to a number of game studios and publishers for comment, including Epic, Microsoft (which owns Minecraft), Ubisoft, Nintendo, Roblox, and Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt Red. Few responded \u2014 and none would give an on-the-record statement.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to get involved in an interview at the moment,\u201d a spokesperson for CD Projekt Red said. EA told TechCrunch it \u201cdidn\u2019t have any comment at this time.\u201d\n\nRisky outputs\n\nIt\u2019s possible that AI companies could prevail in these legal disputes. The courts may decide that generative AI has a \u201chighly convincing transformative purpose,\u201d following the precedent set roughly a decade ago in the publishing industry\u2019s suit against Google.\n\nIn that case, a court held that Google\u2019s copying of millions of books for Google Books, a sort of digital archive, was permissible. Authors and publishers had tried to argue that reproducing their IP online amounted to infringement.\n\nA sample from Sora. Image Credits:OpenAI\n\n\u201cThe key questions around whether AI models\u2019 use of copyrighted materials constitutes copyright infringement remain unsettled,\u201d Jesse Saivar, chair of Greenberg Glusker\u2019s IP and digital media and technology groups, told TechCrunch. \u201cIs there copying of copyrighted works during the training process, and does that constitute copyright infringement? Does it impact the market for the original work? [And] can the copyright owners of the training materials even allege any actual damage or injury?\u201d\n\nA ruling in favor of AI companies wouldn\u2019t necessarily shield their users from accusations of wrongdoing. If a generative model regurgitated a copyrighted work, a person who then went and published that work \u2014 or incorporated it into another project \u2014 could still be held liable for IP infringement.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI systems often spit out recognizable, protectable IP assets as output,\u201d Weigensberg said. \u201cSimpler systems that generate text or static images often have trouble preventing the generation of copyrighted material in their output, and so more complex systems may well have the same problem no matter what the programmers\u2019 intentions may be.\u201d\n\nA sample from Sora. Image Credits:OpenAI\n\nSome AI companies have indemnity clauses to cover these situations, should they arise. But the clauses often contain carve-outs. For example, OpenAI\u2019s applies only to corporate customers \u2014 not individual users.\n\nThere\u2019s also risks beside copyright to consider, Weigensberg says, like violating trademark rights.\n\n\u201cThe output could also include assets that are used in connection with marketing and branding \u2014 including recognizable characters from games \u2014 which creates a trademark risk,\u201d he said. \u201cOr the output could create risks for name, image, and likeness rights.\u201d\n\nThe growing interest in world models could further complicate all this. One application of world models \u2014 which OpenAI considers Sora to be \u2014 is essentially generating video games in real time. If these \u201csynthetic\u201d games resemble the content the model was trained on, that could be legally problematic.\n\n\u201cTraining an AI platform on the voices, movements, characters, songs, dialogue, and artwork in a video game constitutes copyright infringement, just as it would if these elements were used in other contexts,\u201d Avery Williams, an IP trial lawyer at McKool Smith, said. \u201cThe questions around fair use that have arisen in so many lawsuits against generative AI companies will affect the video game industry as much as any other creative market.\u201d"

Gemini 2.0's agent features currently exist as a research prototype under three different names: Project Astra for a universal AI assistant, Project Mariner for specific AI tasks, and Project Jules for developers.\n\nNot to be outdone, OpenAI's demo showcased how ChatGPT's vision modality accurately identified objects \u2014 and was even interruptible. And yes, part of this included a Santa voice option in Voice Mode, complete with a deep, jolly voice and lots of \"ho-ho-hos.\" You can chat with OpenAI's version of Santa by tapping the snowflake icon in ChatGPT. No word yet on whether the real Santa Claus contributed his voice for AI training or OpenAI used his voice without prior consent.\n\nOddly, when selecting the Santa voice in the ChatGPT app, the user is warned that the voice is only for people 13 and older.\n\nStarting today, video and screenshare are available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users, with Enterprise and Edu availability coming in Jan."

            "article_content": "Scientists have accidentally discovered a particle that has mass when it\u2019s traveling in one direction, but no mass while traveling in a different direction. Known as semi-Dirac fermions, particles with this bizarre behavior were first predicted 16 years ago.\n\nThe discovery was made in a semi-metal material called ZrSiS, made up of zirconium, silicon and sulfur, while studying the properties of quasiparticles. These emerge from the collective behavior of many particles within a solid material.\n\n\u201cThis was totally unexpected,\u201d said Yinming Shao, lead author on the study. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even looking for a semi-Dirac fermion when we started working with this material, but we were seeing signatures we didn\u2019t understand \u2013 and it turns out we had made the first observation of these wild quasiparticles that sometimes move like they have mass and sometimes move like they have none.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like an impossible feat \u2013 how can something gain and lose mass readily? But it actually comes back to that classic formula that everyone\u2019s heard of but many might not understand \u2013 E = mc2. This describes the relationship between a particle\u2019s energy (E) and mass (m), with the speed of light (c) squared.\n\nAccording to Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, nothing that has any mass can reach the speed of light, because it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate it to that speed. But a funny thing happens when you flip that on its head \u2013 if a massless particle slows down from the speed of light, it actually gains mass.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. When the quasiparticles travel along one dimension inside the ZrSiS crystals, they do so at the speed of light and are therefore massless. But as soon as they try to travel in a different direction, they hit resistance, slow down and gain mass.\n\n\u201cImagine the particle is a tiny train confined to a network of tracks, which are the material\u2019s underlying electronic structure,\u201d said Shao. \u201cNow, at certain points the tracks intersect, so our particle train is moving along its fast track, at light speed, but then it hits an intersection and needs to switch to a perpendicular track. Suddenly, it experiences resistance, it has mass. The particles are either all energy or have mass depending on the direction of their movement along the material\u2019s \u2018tracks.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe researchers originally set out to study the quantum interactions in the material by watching how the electrons in it responded to light. They found that the energy level of the electrons followed an unexpected pattern as the strength of the magnetic field increases, which turned out to be a key prediction of semi-Dirac fermions.\n\nWhile it\u2019s pretty high-concept physics, the team says the discovery could eventually open up a range of applications for ZrSiS similar to that of graphene.\n\n\u201cIt is a layered material, which means once we can figure out how to have a single layer cut of this compound, we can harness the power of semi-Dirac fermions, control its properties with the same precision as graphene,\u201d said Shao. \u201cBut the most thrilling part of this experiment is that the data cannot be fully explained yet. There are many unsolved mysteries in what we observed, so that is what we are working to understand.\u201d\n\nThe research was published in the journal Physical Review X.\n\nSource: Penn State"

            "article_content": "Check out Sequentum Cloud today and sign up for a free trial.\n\nData is an increasingly valuable commodity in today's digital world. Whether in finance, real estate, e-commerce or healthcare, the ability to extract, analyze and leverage data can provide a competitive edge for businesses across a wide range of industries. However, to fully harness the power of data, it is crucial to use a tool that can deliver reliability, precision and customizability.\n\nCustom web-scraping company Sequentum recently announced the launch of its cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution, Sequentum Cloud. The company says this cutting-edge platform is the ultimate web scraping tool, allowing users of all sizes to access high-quality, trusted, auditable, custom web data on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n\nWhy Low-Code Is Better Than No-Code\n\nWhen it comes to web scraping, many platforms aim to provide a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface that forgoes the need for traditional hand coding. So-called no-code tools may offer simplicity, but with the evolving nature of the internet, they lack the customizability required to handle ever-changing data extraction needs.\n\nSequentum Cloud is a low-code solution, aiming to strike the perfect balance between usability and customizability. Like no-code platforms, Sequentum offers a point-and-click interface for easy agent creation. The company says that around 95% of tasks can be achieved with reusable, composable assets, thereby saving time and allowing you to scale easily.\n\nHowever, for the remaining 5% of tasks, Sequentum Cloud supports custom coding in JavaScript, Python, C# and Regular Expression, giving you the flexibility to handle any data from any data source, in any data structure, to any destination.\n\nHarness The Sequentum Agent Human-Friendly Text Format To Build Trust And Train Your AI To Interact In Complex Ways With The Web\n\nOne of the advantages of Sequentum Cloud is its new and innovative nested, human-readable, text format of the agent you create. With all the data extraction process logic presented in this way, all stakeholders can understand the data and the extraction process, helping to promote trust and transparency in the process and the resulting data.\n\nFurthermore, non-technical staff will be able to review your data collection process by seeing all the steps laid out in a human-readable format and easily read every step that is being followed to obtain the data and ensure compliance with guidelines. For example, some companies might restrict their staff from using web scraping bots to automatically bypass CAPTCHA tests. With human-readable results, compliance teams can more easily verify that restricted activities such as CAPTCHA automation are not happening in their data collection.\n\nSimilarly, the human-friendly agent text format is a turnkey way to train AI to make use of websites and mobile apps no matter how complex the interaction needs to be.\n\nTrust, Transparency And Ethical Compliance\n\nData trustworthiness, transparency and regulatory compliance are of the utmost importance for companies. Sequentum Cloud aims to address this by ensuring that users can see exactly where their data originates from and every step of the collection process, all auditable with full documentation.\n\nSequentum argues that this not only mitigates legal risks, such as those relating to privacy and security, but also makes sure that data aligns with ethical standards. This is crucial when it comes to monetizing data assets since documenting full lineage on all data from how data is sourced and processed will not only enable dataset creators to demonstrate where they added value but will also point to the web sources that contributed to that value.\n\nThis is particularly important for AI, analytics and data-driven decision-making, as a lack of data transparency could mean risking future monetization opportunities or compliance failures as new regulations are adopted. By being proactive and applying transparent data practices today, companies can avoid losing out on all the value they've added once the laws catch up to the way people are working today.\n\nGet Started Today\n\nIn today's competitive environment, trust, precision and transparency are essential if you want to gain an edge. In November, CIOReview named Sequentum as the Enterprise Data Delivery Platform of the Year for 2024. Sequentum Cloud seems poised to be the ultimate web scraper for the most precise and trusted data, combining a low-code platform and point-and-click interface with the power of customization and human-readable nested text format of the agent you create.\n\nSign up for a free trial today and experience the Sequentum Edge.\n\nFeatured photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash.\n\nThis post contains sponsored content.

But in a way those were quite predictable \u2013 Enzo Maresca hinted heavily at appearances for both in his press conferences.\n\nA more surprising name starting his first game of the season is Carney Chukwuemeka, a member of the \u201cbomb squad\u201d in the summer who the club tried and failed to get rid of. After signing from Aston Villa for \u20ac18m, the midfielder has never really been given the opportunities his talent deserve.\n\nThis is not only Chukwuemeka\u2019s first start of the season \u2013 it\u2019s his first start since August last year. In that fateful game against West Ham, the midfielder was given the nod from the start by Mauricio Pochettino and did really well, before suffering a serious knee injury towards the end.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the great \u201csliding doors\u201d moments in recent Chelsea history. We\u2019re convinced that without that injury he would have stayed in the starting XI ( that seems likely given he scored a great goal earlier in the game), and from there, who knows where his Chelsea career might have gone?\n\nCarney Chukwuemeka in training.\n\nCarney gets unexpected chance for what could be his final Chelsea start\n\nRumours have it that the club are keen to move Chukwuemeka on in January \u2013 on loan or permanently. Either way, we don\u2019t expect to see many more appearances in Blue from the youngster. There\u2019s interest from AC Milan, and we\u2019re sure Premier League clubs will be sniffing around him too.\n\nWe\u2019re just glad we get to see one more Carney start before he goes."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Specs Pricing tiers Features Support Privacy and security Which data recovery app is right for you?\n\nI\u2019ve reviewed the best data recovery software you can buy, which often require a costly subscription. However, there are some very good free apps that can help restore your missing files or photos.\n\nCCleaner\u2019s Recuva and DMDE are among the best free data recovery apps that let you preview and restore a wide variety of files at no cost. I\u2019ll focus on the free versions, but also cover the more powerful paid apps.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSpecs\n\nRecuva DMDE Platforms Windows Windows, macOS, Linux Devices unlimited (Free), 3 (Professional) unlimited (Free), 1 (Express, Standard), plus 5 monthly (Professional) Support Email Email Free version? Yes Yes\n\nPricing tiers\n\nRecuva is a full-featured free data recovery app with only minor limitations. There\u2019s no customer service for free users. The app can\u2019t read virtual drives and you have to check for updates manually.\n\nBeyond that, you can use Recuva for free for as long as you like on any Windows computer. There\u2019s not a macOS or Linux version of Recuva and it doesn\u2019t work on mobile devices.\n\nLeading solutions like Stellar Data Recovery restrict free file restoration to 1 GB, which might be enough for lots of documents and several photos. However, the free version might not retrieve all your photos and videos since they take up more space.\n\nFor $25 annually, you can install Recuva Professional on up to three computers and contact support for technical assistance. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with data recovery software and drive technology and formats, technical support could be very important.\n\nDMDE also has a free version that\u2019s just as powerful as the paid app. However, it does have some restrictions. You can restore one folder and 4,000 files at a time.\n\nUnless you dump all you photos and videos in a single folder or store a huge number of files in one place, you\u2019ll need the paid version. Since only one folder can be restored with the free app, you\u2019ll probably need multiple scans to get back missing files.\n\nAn annual subscription to DMDE Express costs $20. There\u2019s also a lifetime plan call DMDE Standard that costs just $48. If you subscribe to DMDE Express for more than two years, DMDE Standard is a better bargain.\n\nDMDE also has professional plans, starting at $95, that let you install the app on more computers.\n\nFeatures\n\nRecuva has a wizard to guide you through data recovery. You select the type of files to restore, but the option of all files seems to make the most sense. Then you get to choose the drive or let the app scan all drives. That can take a long time, so it\u2019s best to select the drive you suspect has missing files.\n\nWhen you start a scan, the app immediately starts listing files that Windows File Explorer won\u2019t show. As the scan continues, more details appear including filename, the folder it\u2019s in, the modification date, size, and more.\n\nRecuva also estimates the recoverability of each file and optionally shows a preview. Those are the most valuable details. If image previews look correct and files are rated with excellent recoverability, the app should be able to restore them.\n\nIn my review of Recuva Professional, I found it to be useful in recovering data from my external hard disk drive (HDD) and my thumb drive. It found 158 of 163 files in the HDD test, which is good, but not great.\n\nDMDE is easy to get started with, but some features can be a little confusing. It\u2019s a much more technical app with powerful and dangerous features like disk editing. It\u2019s wise to make sure you understand what will happen before making a change.\n\nBasic operation is straightforward. You select a drive, start a scan, and watch the file list appear. DMDE shows the folders in a left sidebar and files to the right. It fills in the filename, size, modification date, and shows an optional preview.\n\nThe preview is important since DMDE doesn\u2019t give a recoverability estimate. In my review, DMDE Free restored all 55 files in my folder, but none of the images in subfolders. I\u2019d need the paid version to get everything in one pass.\n\nAs a workaround, I switched to raw recovery, which ignores my folder structure and groups restored files by type. With this trick, I got 162 of 165 files, but with randomly generated numeric filenames.\n\nThe paid version of DMDE managed to restore all my HDD files, but the first letter of each folder was replaced with an underscore \u201c_\u201d symbol.\n\nSolid-state drive (SSD) recovery is almost impossible and neither app could restore a single file in these tests. EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Pro is only app I\u2019ve tested that has successfully undeleted SSD files, which might have been due to lucky timing.\n\nSupport\n\nRecuva has a very limited help center and only offers email support to subscribers. The app has been around for decades, so your best bet is a web search if you need help with the free version.\n\nDMDE doesn\u2019t restrict help to paying customers, giving it an edge against Recuva. Support is via email, so it could take up to 24 hours to get a reply. DMDE\u2019s resource center features tutorials, a manual, and an FAQ so you can get answers faster.\n\nPopular data recovery apps like Disk Drill Pro offer live chat support, but cost more.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nThere\u2019s no need to upload data to recover files, so your files will remain private. However, if you email support or subscribe, your email address and financial information will be on record. That means cybersecurity is worth considering.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any record of a data breach at DMDE, but the developer of Recuva, CCleaner has had some issues. CCleaner has been hit by three major data breaches, one as recent as 2023.\n\nWhich data recovery app is right for you?\n\nThe free versions of Recuva and DMDE are both effective with HDD file recovery. While DMDE restored more data in my tests, it requires multiple passes to get back folders. Recuva is easier to use, but couldn\u2019t find as many missing files.\n\nWhile you could download and run both, HDD scans can be time-consuming, so it\u2019s better to pick one. If you absolutely can\u2019t pay to restore missing files, Recuva has the better free app.\n\nHowever, DMDE\u2019s $20 and Recuva\u2019s $25 annual subscription prices are incredibly affordable. If you\u2019re going to the trouble of scanning and restoring files, it\u2019s worth saving yourself time and effort at such a low cost.\n\nIf your photos, videos, documents, and other files are worth $20, I\u2019d recommend DMDE Express over Recuva Professional. If you anticipate needing to recover files in the future, a one-time purchase of DMDE Standard costs just $48 to use it on your Windows PC, Mac, or Linux computer forever.\n\nThat\u2019s why DMDE is high on our list of the best data recovery software.

            "article_content": "The world saw a staggering surge in conflicts over the past year. At least 233,000 people were estimated to be killed in conflicts in 2024, according to new data released Thursday by a prominent nonprofit analysis and crisis mapping project. The data, released today by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), shows in raw numbers how the level of conflicts around the world have doubled over the past five years, amid wars in Ukraine, Gaza, Myanmar and elsewhere.\n\nAmong the data for this year, ACLED found that the number of people killed in conflicts in 2024 had grown by 30 percent since the preceding year, from 179,099 deaths in 2023 to 233,597 in 2024.\n\nThe war in Ukraine was the deadliest in 2024, with 67,000 reported deaths, while 35,000 deaths were reported in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the end of the year, the number of acts of violence recorded by ACLED is projected to reach almost 200,000, a quarter higher than last year and double what it was five years ago, with sharp increases found in Lebanon (958 percent), as Israel staged a large-scale military intervention, and Russia (349 percent), which has seen more attacks amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe violence has remarkable reach. One in 8 people worldwide were exposed to conflict in 2024, ACLED found. Those living within five kilometers or less of conflict count as exposed. Palestinians face the highest level of violence in the world, according to the data, with 81 percent of the population exposed to conflict.\n\nThe peak may still be ahead. Clionadh Raleigh, a professor of political geography and conflict at the University of Sussex and founder of ACLED, said that she expected global conflict to continue its rise, pointing to \u201cpossible violent surges\u201d in Iran, Chad, Ecuador and Pakistan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe world may be entering a \u201cnew normal\u201d of conflict, said Paul Poast, a professor at the University of Chicago who tracks global violence and was not involved in drafting the ACLED report.\n\nThat would have political implications in the United States, where President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly pledged to \u201cstop war.\u201d Trump \u201cclaimed that he is going to solve all of these conflicts as soon as he enters office (if not before),\u201d Poast said. \u201cIndeed, it stood out to me that during his victory speech on election night, the first thing he mentioned was ending all of the world\u2019s conflicts.\u201d\n\nThe data over the past few years paints an unsettling picture: Few regions saw a decline in conflict, while both Europe and the Middle East saw major escalations. Research by other groups describes the same trend. This summer, a report put out by the Sydney-based Institute for Economics and Peace identified 56 active conflicts taking place at that time, which it said was the most since the end of World War II.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe founding hope of the United Nations, international peace is an increasingly distant prospect, as the trend builds over consecutive years.\n\nHigh levels of conflict worldwide have multiple and complex causes, including choices made by world leaders, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine in 2022. But there have also been global shifts in the way that conflicts are fought, according to the data collected by ACLED.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, conflict became more urbanized and concentrated, and the same places and communities have been attacked several times over,\u201d Raleigh said, adding that the world had seen a 300 percent increase in the use of bombing over the past five years.\n\nThe widespread use of missiles, drones and explosives by governments has added further to the levels of conflict, Raleigh said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome conflicts appeared to be tied to electoral politics, according to the ACLED data, with countries that held elections seeing a more significant rise in violence. Roughly 80 countries, together holding more than half of the world\u2019s population, held national elections in 2024.\n\nThe conflict data tracks incidents of what the authors call political violence \u2014 defined to including battles, bombings and other violent acts \u2014 and excludes nonviolent protest. ACLED notes it also recorded more than 143,000 protests in 2024.\n\nThe ongoing breakdown in global order and rising multipolarity, a world system in which power is more widely distributed, with global bodies such as the United Nations Security Council paralyzed, has led to major powers \u201casserting their regional influence and undermining one another,\u201d Poast said. U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the state of affairs as a \u201cpurgatory of polarity,\u201d in an address to the General Assembly in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nACLED, which has operated for as a nonprofit for just over a decade, collects its data through media monitoring as well as partnerships with international and local organizations. It aims to give a big picture view of trends in armed conflict through the collection of granular, detailed data.\n\nIn the year ahead, some of the conflicts could ease \u2014 particularly the war in Ukraine and fighting across in the Middle East. Some countries, like Madagascar, have seen a prolonged decline in political violence over recent years, according to ACLED.\n\nBut ACLED is predicting a 20 percent increase in conflict next year amid numerous regions of concern, including Colombia and Mexico, along with several areas of Africa like the Sahal and the Great Lakes region. The Middle East remains in a period of great uncertainty, while the risk of new wars involving China or Russia cannot be ruled out."

The new AOC AG326UD might not have the catchiest name, but it sports a decent set of specs with a $799 price tag.\n\nAOC takes up two spots on our best gaming monitor guide, thanks to their affordability and performance. The new AOC AGON Pro monitor appears to be following suit, as it undercuts some QD-OLED and regular OLED monitors by a fair margin in the 4K space.\n\nIn our tests, we\u2019ve found that Samsung\u2019s QD-OLED is generally superior to LG\u2019s competing WOLED tech, especially when it comes to viewing text on the Windows desktop, which can look fuzzier on the latter. AOC also says its new monitor supports TrueBlack HDR400, which will give games deep, rich blacks.\n\nThe monitor also looks set to carry on AOC\u2019s long line of excellent high-refresh rate monitors. While not the fastest, its 165Hz refresh rate is more than enough for most people and will be a massive boon for those deep in the waters of esports or twitch-heavy titles.\n\nThis lower refresh rate than the competition is probably a good reason why this monitor sits at $799 rather than over $1,000. Another bonus is that this new AOC screen is also Nvidia G-Sync compatible, meaning it can synchronize its refresh rate with the frame rate output from the best graphics card models, stopping irritating tearing issues.\n\nOLED tech \u2013 and its spin-offs \u2013 are currently going through a small price crash. On Amazon, large quantities of previously expensive 1440p and 1080p OLED gaming monitors are having hundreds of dollars slashed from their price tags.\n\nAOC\u2019s Agon Pro AG276QZD for, example, which has a 1440p resolution and 240Hz refresh rate, is sitting at a single cent under $500, for example, reduced from $600. Meanwhile, on the competing 4K front, the Asus ROG Swift PG32UCDM has had $300 cut from its price, leaving it at $999.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait for AOC\u2019s newest 4K QD-OLED to cross our desks before we make any real judgment. However, it is still cheaper than the best-known brands even with discounts. The AOC AG326UD also has a 32-inch screen, making it a little bigger than most OLED monitors in this price range.\n\nOLED looks like it is getting cheaper every year, and with CES 2025 coming, we\u2019re expecting to see much more. The sublime color reproduction and fast response times provided by these panels mean that any titles played on the best gaming PCs will almost always look infinitely better than on LCD. Even the best gaming handheld, the Steam Deck, has had an OLED refresh, putting it right at the top of our best gaming handheld guide."

If you want to write it out, it\u2019s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.\n\n\"This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a prediction first made by David Deutsch.\"\n\nApparently, all these wires help to draw information from parallel universes (Google)\n\nAdvert\n\nProfessor Deutsch is a physicist at the University of Oxford, and is known for his work in quantum computing after putting in research during the 1990s, supporting Neven's claims.\n\nSkeptics cast doubts\n\nHowever, some doubters say that these claims about its performance are based on the company's own benchmark to measure quantum performance, and that it doesn't prove that people in parallel universes are getting our information for us.\n\nThe development of Willow and the scientific findings behind it have been published in the journal, Nature."

            "article_content": "Iranian vessel, drone or UFO: Mystery over bizarre lights spotted in skies over New Jersey\n\nDrones of indeterminate origin have been buzzing New Jersey over the last month, prompting a mixed bag of responses from regional lawmakers. The state\u2019s governor has insisted the drones are safe, while a Congressman believes they\u2019re the vanguard of an Iranian \u201cmothership.\u201d\n\nHomeland security officials and regional lawmakers met on Wednesday to discuss the sightings further.\n\nDozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month and have raised growing concern among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over president-elect Donald Trump\u2019sgolf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must also be FAA certified.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost, but not all, of the drones spotted in New Jersey were larger than those typically used by hobbyists, with reports claiming some are the size of an SUV,\n\nThe number of sightings has increased in recent days, though officials say many of the objects seen may have been planes rather than drones. It\u2019s also possible that a single drone has been reported more than once.\n\nA drone of unknown origin was spotted flying over Donald Trump\u2019s Bedminster golf club in New Jersey (TMX)\n\nGov. Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don\u2019t appear to threaten public safety. The FBI has been investigating and has asked residents to share any videos, photos or other information they may have.\n\nMany municipal lawmakers have called for more restrictions on who is entitled to fly the unmanned devices. At least one state lawmaker proposed a temporary ban on drone flights.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is something we\u2019re taking deadly seriously. I don\u2019t blame people for being frustrated,\" New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said earlier this week.\n\nNew Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew echoed Murphy's sentiments.\n\n\u201cWe have a serious problem with our aerospace,\u201d he said on Wednesday before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. \u201cThe recent sightings of unidentified drones in the state of New Jersey, my home state, is justifiably causing tremendous public concern.\u201d\n\nUnlike Murphy, however, Van Drew blamed the drones on an \"Iranian mothership.\"\n\n\"I've learned, for real, that there is circumstantial evidence that there's an Iranian mothership off the East Coast of the United States, and that's launching these drone incursions,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh shot that theory down, assuring ABC News that there \"is not any truth to that \u2014 there is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there's no so called mothership launching drones towards the United States.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to monitor what is happening,\u201d Singh said. \u201cAt no point were our installations threatened when this activity was occurring.\u201d\n\nVan Drew did not buy the Pentagon's response, insisting during an ABC News interview that there is a \"real possibility that it is a foreign entity.\"\n\n\"[The Pentagon says] to us there's nothing to fear, but we have no idea who it is, where it comes from, what it's about, and what it can do,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetails about Wednesday's meeting were not immediately disclosed, and Murphy did not attend.\n\nRepublican Assemblyman Erik Peterson, whose district includes parts of the state where the drones have been reported, said he and other legislators met with Homeland Security and state police officials for about 90 minutes at a state police facility in West Trenton.\n\nPeterson said DHS officials were generous with their time, but appeared dismissive of some concerns, saying not all the sightings reported have been confirmed to involve drones.\n\n\u201cSo who or what is behind the flying objects? Where are they coming from? What are they doing? \u201cMy understanding is they have no clue,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA message seeking comment on Peterson\u2019s remarks was left with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nMost of the drones have been spotted along coastal areas and some were recently reported flying over a large reservoir in Clinton. Sightings also have been reported in neighboring states, including the New York City area, and over Pennsylvania\u2019s Delaware County and Philadelphia.\n\nJames Edwards, of Succasunna, New Jersey, said he has seen a few drones flying over his neighborhood since last month.\n\n\u201cIt raises concern mainly because there's so much that's unknown,\u201d Edwards said Wednesday. \u201cThere are lots of people spouting off about various conspiracies that they believe are in play here, but that only adds fuel to the fire unnecessarily. We need to wait and see what is really happening here, not let fear of the unknown overtake us.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press"

            "article_content": "But this pace of innovation is not guaranteed, and the next frontier of technological advances\u2014from the future of AI to new computing paradigms\u2014will only happen if we think differently.\n\nAtomic challenges\n\nThe modern microchip stretches both the limits of physics and credulity. Such is the atomic precision, that a few atoms can decide the function of an entire chip. This marvel of engineering is the result of over 50 years of exponential scaling creating faster, smaller transistors.\n\nBut we are reaching the physical limits of how small we can go, costs are increasing exponentially with complexity, and efficient power consumption is becoming increasingly difficult. In parallel, AI is demanding ever-more computing power. Data from Epoch AI indicates the amount of computing needed to develop AI is quickly outstripping Moore\u2019s Law, doubling every six months in the \u201cdeep learning era\u201d since 2010.\n\nThese interlinked trends present challenges not just for the industry, but society as a whole. Without new semiconductor innovation, today\u2019s AI models and research will be starved of computational resources and struggle to scale and evolve. Key sectors like AI, autonomous vehicles, and advanced robotics will hit bottlenecks, and energy use from high-performance computing and AI will continue to soar.\n\nMaterials intelligence\n\nAt this inflection point, a complex, global ecosystem\u2014from foundries and designers to highly specialized equipment manufacturers and materials solutions providers like Merck\u2014is working together more closely than ever before to find the answers. All have a role to play, and the role of materials extends far, far beyond the silicon that makes up the wafer.\n\nInstead, materials intelligence is present in almost every stage of the chip production process\u2014whether in chemical reactions to carve circuits at molecular scale (etching) or adding incredibly thin layers to a wafer (deposition) with atomic precision: a human hair is 25,000 times thicker than layers in leading edge nodes.\n\nYes, materials provide a chip\u2019s physical foundation and the substance of more powerful and compact components. But they are also integral to the advanced fabrication methods and novel chip designs that underpin the industry\u2019s rapid progress in recent decades.\n\nFor this reason, materials science is taking on a heightened importance as we grapple with the limits of miniaturization. Advanced materials are needed more than ever for the industry to unlock the new designs and technologies capable of increasing chip efficiency, speed, and power. We are seeing novel chip architectures that embrace the third dimension and stack layers to optimize surface area usage while lowering energy consumption. The industry is harnessing advanced packaging techniques, where separate \u201cchiplets\u201d are fused with varying functions into a more efficient, powerful single chip. This is called heterogeneous integration."
