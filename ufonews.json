        "article_content": "The Argentine comedy \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs\u2019 tells the story of entertainment journalist Jos\u00e9 de Zer in the 1980s. After hearing reports of a UFO sighting in La Candelaria, Jos\u00e9 embarks on a trip with his cameraman, Chango, to find the truth behind the paranormal claims. However, when paltry field evidence surfaces, the protagonist devises a different method to turn the story into a media sensation.\n\nDirected by Diego Lerman, the Netflix film plots a whimsical tale brimming with nostalgia and amusement centered on making aliens believable to the watching public and one man\u2019s efforts to fabricate his own version of events. As the attention grows on the subject matter, the lines between reality and fiction are blurred in a complex drama about personal conceit and the power of belief.\n\nThe Man Who Loved UFOs is a Vague Retelling of a Real Journalist\u2019s Story\n\nOriginally titled \u2018El Hombre Que Amaba Los Platos Voladores\u2019 in Spanish, \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs\u2019 is loosely inspired by the exploits of a real Argentine journalist, Jos\u00e9 de Zer. Written by Diego Lerman and Adri\u00e1n Biniez, the film taps into a mission led by Jos\u00e9 in 1986, when he concocted a report about an alleged UFO landing site close to Uritorco Mountain in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain. The actual evidence was meager and only amounted to some burnt pasture in the middle of nowhere. Jos\u00e9 had heard about it from tabloid reports while working in an area outside C\u00f3rdoba. Subsequently, he recorded footage of the pasture, burnt insects, cave hieroglyphics, and weird lights in the night sky as examples of the alien hauntings in the rural area.\n\nJos\u00e9 spent six months in C\u00f3rdoba, becoming a household name among the public as viewership numbers spiked for his TV network. However, years later, his reports were discovered to be false, and so was the evidence he had presented. For instance, the lights in his videos were found to be cigarettes and flashlights, the burnt insects were planted by Jos\u00e9, and the cave hieroglyphics were nothing more than rock paintings done in his hotel room. The movie attempts to explain the motivations behind Jos\u00e9\u2019s actions by stating it as a form of escapism. For the news-watching public who are tired of the regular coverage of politics, a fabricated truth allows them to believe in something greater than themselves.\n\nThe Movie Blurs the Lines Between Fiction and Reality\n\nWhile Jos\u00e9 de Zer\u2019s real-life case may have inspired the film, much of the narrative deviates from the actual events, including the presence of strange, inexplicable things that border on the paranormal. Even outside the various plot elements, director Diego Lerman stated that while crafting the ins and outs of Jos\u00e9\u2019s life, he had to imagine a majority of the character\u2019s backstory and the people around him. \u201cHe did his public things, but he guarded his private life. So I imagined a lot,\u201d the filmmaker said. The movie places great emphasis on the protagonist\u2019s relationship with his daughter, Martina, whose approval seems to dictate a lot of Jos\u00e9\u2019s motivations. However, the familial dynamics pale in comparison to some of the other exaggerated elements of the story, most importantly the nature of the UFO sightings themselves.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Lerman explained, \u201cThe film does the same thing that Jose did. You don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real or not. It\u2019s all this fiction machine to build a dream or whatever in your imagination. And I did the same. It was so much fun and so great to do the film. I enjoyed it so much, like a kid. The film shows that this is a machine that will make you dream for a moment.\u201d The director insisted that at its heart, the film targets the notion of faith, existence, and believing in a higher power, all amidst an outlandish scenario where a lot of fakery is involved. As such, the story maintains an air of mystery surrounding the possibility of aliens, never disclosing the truth either way except by layering it through the reporter\u2019s eyes.\n\nJos\u00e9 de Zer passed away on April 2, 1997, while battling against Parkinson\u2019s disease and esophageal cancer. His work pioneered a wave of popularity for Argentine TV despite its questionable methods. However, Director Lerman characterized his actions as \u201cmuch more innocent\u201d than they might be viewed today, given the context surrounding 80s media. It also highlighted one of the key themes he wanted to capture in the movie \u2013 fake news, which is a topic that also plagues contemporary discourse. Still, the filmmaker wanted to acknowledge the importance of the other motifs that contribute heavily to the subtext within the narrative. \u201cThere are several levels, different layers that I wanted to develop. It\u2019s a kind of comedy, so I try to tell everything through the eyes of Jose,\u201d Lerman summed up.\n\nRead More: Best Biopics on Netflix"

        "article_content": "For the believers and nonbelievers, the Pentagon answered whether UFOs or aliens have ever visited Earth, saying there is no evidence.\n\nPentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder fielded several questions from reporters on Thursday on topics such as the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the use of B-2 bombers to conduct precision strikes on five military sites controlled by Houthi forces in Yemen, and North Korean soldiers fighting on behalf of Russia in Ukraine. On top of those subjects, the daily news cycle is filled with nonstop election coverage.\n\nJeff Schogol of Task & Purpose, which provides military news, culture and analysis by members of that community, took the opportunity to go off-topic with Ryder, and asked about one of Earth\u2019s biggest mysteries.\n\n\u201cGiven the news cycle, you could announce anything about aliens or extraterrestrial life, and no one would care,\u201d Schogol said. \u201cSo\u2026I\u2019m just going to take the shot. What do you got on UFOs, aliens, etc.?\u201d\n\n7 Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder answered whether UFOs or aliens have ever visited Earth on Thursday. AP\n\n7 Ryder declared there is no evidence that UFOs or aliens ever visited Earth. AP\n\n\u201cThe truth is out there, Jeff, and the truth is, we have no evidence to indicate extraterrestrial life has visited the planet,\u201d Ryder said.\n\nThe spokesperson\u2019s message was the same that was given months ago on the topic after the coordination of efforts to get to the bottom of whether UFOs, unidentified anomalous phenomena, UAPs, and aliens had been to Earth.\n\nOn July 20, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced the establishment of an All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).\n\nAARO\u2019s mission is to synchronize efforts across the DoD and other U.S. federal departments and agencies to \u201cdetect, identify and attribute objects of interest\u201d in or around military facilities or airspace, which could pose a threat to safety of operations or national security \u2014 this includes anomalous, unidentified space, airborne, submerged and trans medium objects.\n\n7 In the summer of 2022, the Department of Defense announced the establishment of an All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) was formed to \u201cdetect, identify and attribute objects of interest\u201d in or around military facilities or airspace. AP\n\n7 The AARO will look for anything that poses a threat to the safety of operations or national security which includes unidentified airborne objects. AARO/SWNS\n\nThen in November, the DoD set up a website to report government activity related to unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), also known as UFOs.\n\nBut after setting up the AARO and conducting multiple investigations, the DoD claims there is no evidence any UAPs came from out of this world.\n\n\u201cThe aggregate findings of all USG investigations to date have not found even one case of UAP representing off-world technology,\u201d according to the report, which was released on March 1, and \u201cauthentic sensitive national security programs\u201d were \u201cmistaken\u201d with UFO programs.\n\n\u201cAARO has no evidence for the USG reverse-engineering narrative provided by interviewees and has been able to disprove the majority of the interviewees\u2019 claims,\u201d the report says, although \u201csome claims are still under evaluation.\u201d\n\n7 A tiny body of a specimen that Mexican journalist and UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan says is not related to any known Earthly species was revealed in Mexico City, Mexico last fall. REUTERS\n\n7 Maussan presented the bodies to Mexico\u2019s Congress last year. REUTERS\n\nOther conclusions put forth in the report include the public\u2019s general mistrust of the government and \u201cperceived bureaucratic barriers,\u201d intense secrecy related to military programs and growing interest in UFOs.\n\nTo put the rapidly growing interest in UFOs into perspective \u2014 a once-considered taboo subject that destroyed careers, like Bob Lazar\u2019s after he was essentially forced to hide in exile, had its own Super Bowl commercial.\n\n7 The Department of Defense set up a website to report activity related to UFOs in the fall of 2023.\n\nRyder, at around the same time the report was released, said there was no evidence that any information was \u201cillegally or inappropriately\u201d withheld from Congress.\n\n\u201cWhat we found was that claims of hidden programs are largely the result of circular reporting by a small group repeating what they heard from others and that many people have sincerely misinterpreted real events for mistaking sensitive U.S. programs as UAP or being extra-terrestrial exploitation,\u201d he said."

        "article_content": "Archeologists in Denmark have made one of the most notable discoveries in recent history: a group of 50 skeletons found in a burial ground, believed to be from the Viking Era. The skeletal remains could help scientists unearth some of the mysteries around Viking DNA, and provide new answers about this centuries-old civilization.\n\nThe skeletons were reportedly preserved due to favorable conditions near the burial site; they were discovered in mid-October near the village of \u00c5sum, a remote settlement located three miles from Denmark's third-largest city, Odense, on the island of Funen. And scientists are just now getting started on unlocking the puzzles behind these ancient remains.\n\nWhat did the archeologists discover?\n\nA team from Denmark's Museum Odense located the burial site, which covers around 21,500 square feet and \"was used in the 8th and 9th centuries,\" the museum said in a press release. A \"total of 50 inhumation graves and five cremation graves have been found, placing the burial ground among the largest Viking burial sites discovered on the island of Funen.\" The discovery proves that the area was a \"key geographical point for the earliest urban developments\" in what would become modern Denmark. The graves contained men, women and children.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

This includes a woman who was \"buried in a wagon, the upper part of a Viking cart used as a coffin,\" as well as another grave containing a \"fine bronze three-lobed brooch, a single red glass bead that hung on a cord around the deceased's neck, an iron knife, and a small piece of rock crystal.\"\n\nWhat can these skeletons tell us about the Vikings?\n\nThe finding of the graves \"opens a whole new toolbox for scientific discovery,\" Museum Odense curator Michael Borre Lund\u00f8 said to Newsweek. The museum is hoping to perform DNA analysis on the recovered skeletons to see what information can be obtained from their bones.\n\nThis discovery in particular is rare because of the well-preserved nature of the remains. Often \"when we excavate bodies from the Viking age, we are lucky if there are just a few teeth,\" Lund\u00f8 said to CNN. But in this case, the dampness of the region meant that for \"long periods of time the bodies of the Vikings were covered in water, which slows down the decomposition of the bones.\u201d\n\nAs noted in the museum's press release, DNA testing on the skeletons could provide information on the \"general health, diet, and origins of those buried\" in \u00c5sum. DNA imaging \"might even reveal whether the buried Vikings were related, which would be particularly significant, as this has never been examined in similar graves.\" This could \"give us a much better idea of people's ages, sex, what diseases they might have had,\" and more, Lund\u00f8 said to CNN.\n\nScientists are \"really hoping to gain the larger picture,\" conservator Jannie Amsgaard Ebsen said to The Associated Press. \"Who were the people that were living out there? Who did they interact with? It's a little bit like a jigsaw puzzle: all the various puzzle parts will be placed together.\" Archeologists are continuing to dig up some of the area around \u00c5sum, CNN reported. Most of the skeletons themselves have already been removed from the burial site, and are currently awaiting further testing and DNA extraction."

        "article_content": "Earlier today, OnePlus confirmed plans for its next-gen software overhaul based on Android 15, but so far, details of its upcoming flagship have remained tightly under wraps. Well, it seems leaks have other intentions.\n\nOn the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo, an image allegedly depicting the OnePlus 13 has been making rounds. Moreover, the material comes from a reliable source (Digital Chat Station), which lends further credibility to the leak.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhen it comes to the design, it seems that OnePlus is playing it close home once again. The camera island at the back appears to have been borrowed from the OnePlus 12. This time around, however, we have a small metallic line linking the camera hump to the right edge of the frame.\n\nAbove the line is a minimalist \u201cH\u201d logo, which is again a clear sign that Hasselblad camera tuning will also be used on the OnePlus 13. The most notable change, however, seems to be flat metallic sides.\n\nOver the past few generations, OnePlus flagships have sided with curved metallic frames, which actually feel a lot more comfortable to hold. The imminent tweak seems like an undesirable change and one that follows in the aesthetic footsteps of Samsung and Apple.\n\nBut what sets the OnePlus 13 apart is the texture on the rear shell, which is apparently inspired by rocks or minerals of some kind, with a familiar matte texture to it. I am quite fond of the surface finish on the OnePlus 12, and the leaked image suggests that the upcoming phone won\u2019t stray too far.\n\nOnePlus recently told Digital Trends that it is experimenting with natural materials like marble to design its phones, and so far, the results have been mighty impressive.\n\nIn addition to a black trim, it seems a pearl-white color option is also on the design table for the OnePlus 13. The company already offers something similar on the OnePlus 12, and my colleague Tushar Mehta liked it so much that he labeled it as \u201cElvis Presley of Android Phones.\u201d\n\nAs far as the innards go, there will be three camera lenses at the back, while the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 silicon will provide the firepower. We are also hearing rumors of a unique localized refresh rate tech for the screen, a larger battery, and some AI boost for the OxygenOS software experience.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems a price hike will also tag along with the long list of generation-over-generation changes. The phone is expected to launch close to the end of October, but that\u2019s likely the release timeline for the Chinese market, while a global debut will commence a few weeks later."

        "article_content": "Netstock\u2019s new inventory management 2024 benchmark report is a resource for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) striving to optimize their inventory performance. With excess stock now accounting for 38% of SMBs\u2019 inventory and significant gaps in demand planning, this report provides businesses with data needed to measure their performance against industry peers, identify areas for improvement, and set realistic, actionable goals.\n\nThe report highlights five emerging trends that emphasize the urgent need for SMBs to develop more robust supply and demand planning software strategies in an ever-shifting global marketplace.\n\n1 Addressing Inventory Excess\n\nSMBs have held onto fewer goods this past year but struggled to get rid of slow-moving inventory. Netstock\u2019s benchmark report shows that smaller businesses have reduced the overall inventory levels, showing a 9% year-over-year decrease in total inventory value. However, nearly 80% of SMBs continue to struggle with inadequate forward planning and overstock issues, indicating persistent worries about not being able to get inventory.\n\n\u201cIf you step back two to three years, we all know where this excess comes from,\u201d says Barry Kukkuk, CTO and co-founder of Netstock. \u201cA lot of SMBs got burned from over-ordering their inventory during the peak of COVID-19 and have continued to try to compensate from these past experiences.\u201d\n\nViewed year-over-year, while purchase orders steadily rose by 9% in early 2023 and skyrocketed ahead of the holiday shopping season for retail businesses to 16% in the first half of 2023, businesses weren\u2019t moving enough goods to keep up with the big stockpiles accumulated. Yet, by early 2024, average inventory spending returned to a near identical pre-crisis level (less than 1% difference from 2023).\n\n2 Navigating Long Lead Times and Lead Time Variability\n\nNetstock\u2019s report shows that lead times began on a downward slope in 2023, dropping a full week from an average of 61.5 days to 54.1 by Q3. But when global unrest knocked supply chains off course, and turnover plateaued in the second half of the year, supplier delays predictably picked back up all the way into 2024.\n\nThe report identified that 58% of SMBs cite long lead times as a significant challenge, where the dominant issue for suppliers is lead time variability, affecting 72% of SMBs.\n\nLooking regionally across key areas, the majority of SMBs from the study are struggling with lead time variability when sourcing their inventory from China (67%), more than from the U.S. (56%), Canada (21%), and Mexico (just 9%).\n\n\u201cEven though things started getting better, with lead times coming down over the year, the variability of lead times has made it very hard to plan,\u201d Kukkuk says. \u201cIf your supplier says we will deliver in 90 days, but sometimes it's 120 days, and sometimes it's 60 days, you don't know what you're going to get.\u201d\n\n3 Looking for Suppliers Close to Home\n\nAmerican SMBs are shifting away from overseas suppliers and are bringing production closer to home. According to the benchmark report, only 25% of U.S. respondents prefer offshore suppliers over domestic ones.\n\nChallenges that range from tariffs and increased compliance regulation to regional political instability overseas, mean SMBs find it harder to work with overseas suppliers. Part of this difficulty comes from the inflexibility or constraints imposed for meeting minimum order quantities (MOQ); the study cited MOQ as a major challenge for 54% of SMBs.\n\n\u201cThe further away you source, the bigger the containerization issue becomes,\u201d says Kukkuk. \u201cIf you want to buy things from an overseas supplier, you may already have three-quarters of a container filled with a current order, but the overseas supplier demands that you must fill this container with their MOQ requirements before you even start shipping.\u201d\n\nThe requirement to order extra stock can increase hesitation in purchasing from overseas suppliers, particularly because of additional costs such as overflow warehousing, increased insurance, or refrigeration for managing excess inventory.\n\n4 Using Financing to Manage Excess Stock\n\nExcess stock grew to 38% of SMBs' inventory over the past year, which is a sign that companies struggle to optimize their inventory. However, Netstock\u2019s research reveals access to financing may influence an SMB\u2019s willingness to carry the excess. For example, over half (54%) of survey respondents with more than 20% excess inventory rely on inventory financing.\n\n\u201cOne of the interesting findings we identified is the bigger the company, the more excess they\u2019re willing to carry as inventory,\u201d says Kukkuk. \u201cThis behavior likely stems from the fact that finance options are more accessible to the larger companies in the survey.\u201d\n\nWhile larger SMBs may have the working capital to justify holding onto inventory as a precaution, smaller companies need to be more agile, since they don\u2019t have the luxury of just sitting on inventory.\n\n5 AI is an Untapped Opportunity\n\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) has become a leading trend in enterprises, SMBs\u2019 adoption of it is often at odds with the hype, based on wider concerns of data alignment and proper use cases. In this regard, only 23% of SMBs who responded said they have invested in AI.\n\nThe two biggest areas the benchmark report identified are concerns about data integrity or security risks (23%) and inconsistent or inaccurate outputs (20%). These adoption barriers are rooted in a lack of confidence in the technology rather than organizational hurdles such as stakeholder buy-in (8%) or prohibitive costs (just 4%).\n\n\u201cSince SMBs don\u2019t have the resources to employ thousands of data scientists, our approach at Netstock is focused on leveling the playing field for SMBs by allowing them to use AI-based insights to think more quickly and act more strategically,\u201d says Kukkuk.\n\nTo help remedy this reluctance, Kukkuk notes technology providers need to help SMBs adopt AI in two core ways. First, leveraging AI as a recommendation engine by synthesizing the sea of day-to-day information provided in reports and dashboards. Second, fine-tuning machine-learning algorithms by filtering vast amounts of historical data and enriching them with external data for improved forecasting accuracy.\n\nLeading the way for SMBs: Netstock\u2019s Inventory Management 2024 Benchmark Report\n\nNetstock is a global leader in supply and demand planning software with more than 15 years\u2019 experience, using cutting-edge technology to empower SMBs to optimize inventory management and streamline their supply chains.\n\nAs such, Netstock is uniquely positioned to bring this first-of-its-kind report to the market \u2014 Netstock's Inventory Management 2024 Benchmark Report. Drawing insights from Netstock\u2019s customer base of more than 2,400 SMBs, the report offers critical insights on global trends, challenges, and paths to optimization for inventory management. Netstock continues to enable businesses worldwide to navigate the complexities of supply chain management.
