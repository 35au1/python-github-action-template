        "article_content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nAI-generated images are more impressive than ever, with some even winning photography awards and fooling experts in the process. The best part? You don\u2019t need to be a professional artist or have any technical skills to create them. But not all AI image generators are created equal \u2014 some excel at realism, while others are riddled with easy-to-spot errors. One thing is for sure: very few can generate text reliably. To find the best one then, I pushed each AI image generator with successively challenging prompts. Here are my findings.\n\nWhich is the best AI image generator?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nFinding the best AI image generator is difficult since the results can vary wildly from one prompt to another. However, we know that generative AI tech tends to struggle in certain areas more than others so we can tailor our prompts to highlight these weaknesses and see where each one shines \u2014 or fails. Virtually all image generators can handle simpler art styles so I\u2019ll limit testing to realistic scenes this time.\n\nIf you ever need to stress test an AI image generator, try asking for images with intricate details like hands, hair, or text. Only a handful of them can handle these well, with others often producing distorted or unrealistic results. Another good test is complex scenes with multiple subjects or unusual perspectives, which tend to trip up even the best models.\n\nWith that in mind, I decided to test a handful of different AI image generators. Specifically, I picked Google\u2019s Imagen 3, Meta\u2019s Imagine, DALL-E 3 via Microsoft Designer and ChatGPT, and Grok. And for my first prompt, I asked for an image of a person crying. This request may seem too surface, but the result variance was fascinating.\n\nPrompt 1: A person crying, with tears streaming down their face\n\nMicrosoft Designer / DALL-E 3 Meta Imagine Google Imagen 3 ChatGPT / DALL-E 3 Grok\n\nAs you can already tell, images from different AI models look nothing alike. While part of this is because my prompt was rather vague, every image generator I tested was also trained on a different dataset. Meta used public images from Facebook and Instagram, for example, while it\u2019s less clear how most other companies obtained their training datasets.\n\nReplicating anatomy has always been tricky for AI image generators and these results only proves that fact. Google\u2019s Imagen 3 produced an extremely convincing result, with others like Meta\u2019s Imagine generated . I retested this prompt with minor variations to improve the sample size but Imagen 3 did win every single time.\n\nMicrosoft Designer uses OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 3 under the hood, meaning it should produce similar results as ChatGPT. And that proved to be true in my testing, with both services delivering decent results.\n\nWinner: Imagen 3, followed by DALL-E 3\n\nPrompt 2: An action-packed scene of two dancers mid-performance in a rain-soaked street\u2026\n\nMeta Imagine Google Imagen 3 Microsoft Designer Grok ChatGPT / DALL-E 3\n\nI increased the complexity and detail of my prompt this time, while keeping human subjects in the frame. Imagen 3 yielded an excellent result once again, only faltering with one subject\u2019s fingers. On the other hand, Meta\u2019s Imagine botched one dancer\u2019s limbs and face entirely and I would consider the result unusable.\n\nMicrosoft Designer offered cartoon-style results, which looked passable but wasn\u2019t what I was looking for. ChatGPT\u2019s attempt was much worse, with an extra limb sprouting out of one dancer. Thankfully, Grok swung the pendulum back with a reasonable result besides the dancers\u2019 interlocked fingers.\n\nWinner: Imagen 3 / Grok\n\nPrompt 3: Generate an image of an Airbus A380\u2026taxiing down a runaway with tropical trees in the background.\n\nMicrosoft Designer Google Imagen 3 Meta Imagine Grok ChatGPT / DALL-E 3\n\nI may sound like a broken record at this point but Imagen 3 continues to decimate the competition. Even though this prompt requires the AI to generate text on the fuselage, Google\u2019s model handled it with ease. The airline\u2019s name is replicated perfectly and aside from the odd runway taxiway markings, it\u2019s nearly impossible to tell that the image has been AI generated.\n\nGrok delivered a similarly impressive result, although not on the first try, and still garbled some windows on the plane\u2019s upper deck. The chatbot uses a relatively new image generator called Flux, created by the researchers who developed Stable Diffusion. Given the latter\u2019s reputation in the image generator space, it\u2019s no surprise that Grok can produce excellent results.\n\nUnfortunately, the other AI image generators delivered sub-par to comically bad results here. Meta\u2019s Imagine spit out garbled text and the wrong plane. DALL-E 3 via ChatGPT almost nailed the text on the side of the plane but generated malformed runway markings. Microsoft Designer uses the same DALL-E 3 model but somehow delivered even worse-looking unrealistic images.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that adding terms like \u201cphotorealistic\u201d or \u201cHD\u201d did little to make the AI-generated results any more authentic-looking or lifelike. The impact was minimal at best, even though it\u2019s standard practice to include these terms as part of good prompting.\n\nWinner: Imagen 3, followed by Grok\n\nPrompt 4: Famous personalities\n\nGrok Grok\n\nA lot has been said about the dark side of AI image generators and their ability to sway public opinion through false narratives. To combat this problem, most generative AI platforms now have guardrails preventing you from requesting images that mimic a specific person.\n\nUnsurprisingly then, my prompt was turned down by every single AI image generator \u2013 except Grok. Elon Musk created Grok as a maximum \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d AI, which is just marketing speak for a chatbot with fewer guardrails than its competitors. This lack of restrictions extends to AI-generated images, as well, which means you could technically generate images of world leaders, celebrities, and even Musk himself in questionable settings.\n\nWinner: Grok by default\n\nWhich AI image generator do I recommend?\n\nMany of the AI image generators I tested have unique strengths that make them better than the rest, so here\u2019s my top pick depending on my priorities. Quality : Google\u2019s Imagen 3 may not have the most recognizable brand name of all the AI image generators on this list, but it stands out for delivering realistic images and extremely believable results. The only downside is that you only get one image at a time and the AI processing can take several seconds each time you send in a prompt.\n\n: Google\u2019s Imagen 3 may not have the most recognizable brand name of all the AI image generators on this list, but it stands out for delivering realistic images and extremely believable results.

Speed : Meta Imagine stands out if you need a quick image since you don\u2019t even need to hit the Enter key to see a result. The tool generates an image within a second of typing in a prompt, which feels almost instantaneous compared to other offerings on this list.\n\n: Meta Imagine stands out if you need a quick image since you don\u2019t even need to hit the Enter key to see a result.

Cost : With so many AI image generators available today, is paying for one even worth it? Doing so will unlock some nice features, since AI image editing is typically locked behind subscription services like Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, and DALL-E 3. For simple AI image generation, though, I\u2019d recommend Imagen 3, Meta Imagine, and Microsoft Designer.\n\n: With so many AI image generators available today, is paying for one even worth it?

Censorship: Grok offers one of the easiest AI image generators with some of the least restrictions, so it\u2019s worth a try. The only downside is that you\u2019ll need an X Premium (formerly Twitter Blue) subscription to use the service. From a practical standpoint, though, the best AI image generator may very well be the one already on your device. For example, Meta AI is already integrated within WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. If you already use either app, Meta Imagine should serve you for basic image generation needs.\n\nLikewise, the Pixel 9 series ships with Google\u2019s new Pixel Studio app powered by Imagen 3. Alternatively, you can also request AI-generated images via the Gemini app on any Android device. The latter still uses the last-gen Imagen 2 for now, but it will move up to Google\u2019s latest model soon.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

On Melodio, you can input prompts based on your current mood, and the system will continuously generate customized music to match the specified style. So, how does the experience of the Melodio app hold up? Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nUser interface\n\nMelodio\u2019s interface design is simple and intuitive, with the main functions easy to navigate and smooth overall operation. The home screen is the music player, where the background\u2019s wave visualization changes color, making the listening experience more immersive. At the bottom is a music description panel, and when swiping to the far right card, you\u2019ll find the lyrics. On the far left is a music discovery area, where you can easily find music to listen to. The top-left corner houses the \u201cMy\u201d section, where you can browse your saved and favorite tracks anytime. The app doesn\u2019t offer settings or other similar options, making it extremely minimalist.\n\nUser experience\n\nAll you need to do is enter keywords into the search bar, and the app\u2019s AI will quickly generate a song that matches the description.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while it supports Chinese-language prompts, we could only hear music when using individual Chinese words in testing. When we inputted combined Chinese descriptive phrases, the system didn\u2019t respond. For example, entering \u201chard rock, Linkin Park style\u201d in Chinese resulted in no output.\n\nWe then tried using simple English descriptions, such as \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cWinter Cabin Escape with Metal Essentials,\u201d both successfully generated music that fitted the described atmosphere.\n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that, in some cases, the AI-generated music may sound repetitive or disconnected, which can slightly affect the listening experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Melodio is a promising AI music app. If you\u2019re a music lover or want to experience AI\u2019s new approach to music creation, Melodio is worth a try. However, its current features are still somewhat incomplete, and we hope to see improvements in the future.\n\nPros:\n\n\u2022 Listen to any style of music you want\n\nCons:\n\n\u2022 Interface does not yet support Chinese\n\n\u2022 Poor recognition of Chinese descriptions"

There is an energy that recalls past lives lived inside their walls, permeating every creaking floorboard.\n\nAuthor and paranormal investigator Katie Hopkins will share her experiences and explorations into realms beyond the ordinary \u2013 including haunting occurrences at the Russell House, in special fundraising events Oct. 19.\n\n\u201cParanormal 101 Presentation and Book Signing\u201d is at 5 p.m. at the historic Snowden House, 306 Washington St., hosted by Friends of the Grout\u2019s Historic Houses. Hopkins will discuss history of the paranormal, why research is important to paranormal investigators and various types of investigation methods.\n\nHopkins, of Cedar Rapids, will also sign copies of her books, \u201cSeeing Spirits: Opening the Empathic Door\u201d and \u201cIowa Haunted Corridor.\u201d Copies will be available to purchase for $15.\n\nFollowing the presentation, guests will venture into shadowy corridors and spaces where spirits may linger in grand 1861 Rensselaer Russell House Museum, 520 W. Third St., and the historic Victorian-era Snowden House. Both homes are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hopkins and her husband Josh and Lollman Paranormal will lead the paranormal investigation at both houses using the latest paranormal investigation equipment.\n\nBoth events are fundraisers for the Friends of the Grout Historic Houses, benefiting the Russell House Museum and Snowden House. Pre-registration is required for both events. The presentation and book signing are $15 for members; $20 for non-members. The investigation is $50 for members; $55 for non-members. To register visit www.gmdistrict.org/calendar.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for different ways to raise money to support preservation of our two houses. We thought something like this might attract a different and perhaps a younger audience,\u201d said Hawkeye Community College instructor Marcea Seible. She also serves on the Friends board.\n\n\u201cWe would love to sell out. We\u2019re hopeful that it will be a popular event, and we can do something similar in the coming years,\u201d Seible explained.\n\nHopkins was 10 when she saw her first spirit in the basement of a friend\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cThat was the focus of my first book. I \u2018ve always been interested in the paranormal and supernatural. My first interest was in history \u2013 that\u2019s what drew me into the paranormal, too, exploring really cool historical places where ghost hunters get to go into,\u201d she said.\n\nShe earned a history degree at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls and a master\u2019s degree in higher education from Kaplan University. She worked as an intern at the Grout in 2008 and returned in 2012 as a museum assistant, which included managing the Rensselaer Russell House Museum.\n\nWhether or not the Rensselaer Russell House is haunted, it has had its share of tragedy and loss. In 1862, 5-year-old Genevieve Russell fell into a well on a neighboring property and drowned. Her funeral wake took place in the Russell home. Once, while in the master bedroom looking at a photograph of Genevieve, Hopkins felt a small hand grab her leg. She\u2019s convinced she was touched by the child\u2019s spirit.\n\n\u201cI was in the Russell House alone eight hours a day. I\u2019d see things move and hear things \u2013 footsteps on the stairs or glassware sitting on the dining table rattle, or find the photo of Genevieve moved, when I was the only one there,\u201d Hopkins recalled.\n\nOn one occasion, she closed the museum, and the next morning found every drawer and cabinet door open, although the house was still locked up tight. Hopkins once heard the doorbell signal someone entering and searched the house to find no one else there. Other people recount seeing a girl in an upper window of the house, and a light at night when the museum is closed.\n\nIn 2012, with Hopkins\u2019 encouragement, the Grout board allowed the Calhoun County Paranormal Investigators to set up video and recording equipment and electromagnetic field detectors and stayed overnight in the house.\n\n\u201cI really made a connection with that house and the spirits in it. I\u2019m so excited to be back to do these fundraisers,\u201d said Hopkins. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many historical houses and buildings fall into disrepair. People lived in these houses and experienced love, loss and tragedy. These are so much more than just old buildings.\u201d\n\nThe need for funds is serious and ongoing, said Seible.\n\n\u201cAll money goes directly to upkeep and maintenance at the houses. Both houses need work, the Russell house, in particular. It really needs foundation work \u2013 limestone is crumbling in some places, so that\u2019s the most pressing issue.\u201d\n\nClose Nicholas Erickson, artifacts registrar at Grout Museum District, looks over the telegram sent to Henry Grout informing him his brother, Warren, had been shot and killed in Tombstone, Ariz., in 1883.

        "article_content": "A woman shares a haunted experience in a house, which is located near the coast of Eastern England. This video has baffled everyone all over the internet. This house is known to be the most haunted house of England, which is also termed as The Cage. It refers to the purpose of the house that originally served as a prison for witches including Ursula Kemp. A plaque on the side of the building describes the plight of Ursula Kemp, who was imprisoned in The Cage on suspicion of witchcraft before she was hanged in Chelmsford in 1582. Even in the 21st century, it is believed that the spirits haunt people living in the house and it has been claimed by a woman, who was its owner, who wanted to sell the house for crores.\n\nFormer owner Vanessa Mitchell, who bought The Cage in Colchester Road, St Osyth in 2005, claims that she was aware of this house and used to walk past this house as a child. She bought the house without fully knowing the history of the house. She shared that, since the time she moved into the house, she felt several paranormal activities inside it. She shared that the paranormal activities were active and the situation became very hostile over months and years. She cites that sometimes, she saw doors would open and shut, the fire would start swinging back and forth, and the latches on the door would go. All the rooms would freeze and she could see mysterious blood splatters.\n\nHer claims led to paranormal investigators making regular visits to The Cage and it was also the subject of a Channel 4 docu drama.\n\nThe former owner of the house lasted four years in the house putting it up for sale, following the number of paranormal incidents. Vanessa has tried to sell The Cage numerous times since 2008 and with a number of different estate agents. Most agents advised her to sell The Cage at auction at ridiculous prices or were not at all interested as they predicted it could not be sold. Ultimately it was sold in the year 2020."

It has similar paraphernalia on top and Ghostbusters stickers on the side.\n\nHe bought the 2009 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor from someone in Glenrock a few years ago. He renamed it the \u201cEcto Interceptor.\u201d\n\nA hospital security guard when not busting ghosts, McDaniels had his uniform on when he initially drove the unmodified car. Wyoming Highway Patrol pulled him over, thinking he might be trying to impersonate a police officer.\n\nGhostbuster Interceptor\n\n\u201cI thought I should probably make this car less cop like and more something fun. And I had always wanted to have a Ghostbusters car, so I started to put stickers on it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell then I thought, now I\u2019ve got to build a top in it, it can\u2019t just be stickers right? So, I started piecing together bit by bit the roof rack and housing and built all that out. There is one piece of pipe up that\u2019s up there being held onto the roof by a toilet flange.\u201d\n\nOnce he had his wheels, as well as the \u201cECTOI\u201d license plate, the doors opened for him to use it for fundraisers and to market his ghost removal side gig.\n\nOctober becomes the busy season. There is a \u201cTouch a Truck\u201d event on Oct. 12 at the Excel Academy Private School that allows kids to get in the vehicle, turn on the sirens, read the special tag fastened on the dash that labels the machine as belonging to Wyoming Ghostbusters, and check out the glove compartment.\n\n\u201cThere is a ghostbuster\u2019s employee handbook and a little canister of ectoplasm slime,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids like to play with all that stuff.\u201d\n\nHe also plans to be at a car show and food drive at the Izaak Walton Clubhouse in Casper on Oct. 18 and end the month on Oct. 25, 27 and 28 with actual ghostbusting demonstrations at the Casper Elks Lodge No. 1353 where he said the equipment used by paranormal investigators will be explained and a walk through of the lodge will be conducted.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m discussing a fundraiser for a lady that is trying to fight cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try and kind of use the car as a way to help people out.\u201d\n\nAs in the movie, McDaniels and some other members of the team have uniforms and he and a buddy have the proton packs used in the last version of the film series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the iconic part of Ghostbusters history, it gets people excited,\u201d he said.\n\nSupernatural Missions\n\nIn addition to the fundraising, and parties, McDaniels also has been on an estimated 15 missions to identify or remove potential paranormal spirits in places around the region and state.\n\nHe recently was called to a Casper home where the owners discovered a set of footprints on concrete that went from a pickup truck to the garage door and then just vanished.\n\n\u201cWhat it looked like was that somebody had walked through a puddle of grease, made about four or five steps to the garage door and then nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of crazy.\u201d\n\nMcDaniels pulled out his EMF meter that measures electro-magnetic energy and found it registered a few points over the footprints and faded when pulled away from them. He checked to see if there were any internet routers or other source of energy nearby that would trigger the meters. There were none.\n\nOther tools in his ghostbusting toolbox include REM-Pod devices that reflect electromagnetic field changes and air temperature changes and a specialized SLS (Structured Light Sensor) camera that uses infrared light. It can 3D map areas in front of it \u201cso we can see things the human eye might miss,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also uses other cameras that can capture images in ultraviolet, infrared, and the normal spectrum of light.\n\nAt the garage, McDaniels set up some REM Pods around the area to see if anything would trigger them. Nothing happened. Photos with the infrared camera found nothing.\n\nBut it\u2019s not always that way. McDaniels tells the story of being called to a Casper home about five blocks from the cemetery with a man experiencing doors being slammed in his home for no reason.\n\n\u201cHe said he was sitting on the couch one day and he felt like his leg started to burn,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cHe looked down and it looked like a handprint had been slapped on his thigh. So, we got to go down and work with that.\u201d\n\nThe man requested that McDaniels and his team bless the house. McDaniels said he has studied different spiritual beliefs including druidism and another team member is a Norse shaman.\n\n\u201cPeter McDaniel turned a former police interceptor into his Ecto Interceptor.

(Courtesy Peter McDaniels) Arrow left Arrow right\n\nStubborn Spirit\n\nTheir attempts to get rid of the spirit by blessing the house did not work. He claims it was forced into a back room. McDaniels had read about a dybbuk box used in Jewish tradition that is supposed to be able to contain a spirit. So, he tried using one.\n\n\u201cWe kind of forced this thing into the dybbuk box and sealed it,\u201d he said. McDaniels said as he was talking to the man at the house, he placed the box by the front tire of his Ghostbuster car and the tire deflated. He had to pump it up to leave.\n\nThere was another hurdle as well. Weather at the time was cold and the ground hard, so he couldn\u2019t bury the box as would be his practice. So, he kept it in a storage area at his house. McDaniels noticed the wax seal that he put on the box kept cracking. He needed to keep sealing it nearly every day.\n\nThen his radio started to flip on in his house at random times and the song coming out of the speakers would have a lyric such as \u201cset me free\u201d or \u201clet me loose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like, no buddy, that\u2019s not how this works,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cAs soon as it was warm enough we went and buried the box and all of that stopped afterwards.\u201d\n\nHe said the man in the house never had issues again as well.\n\n\u2018Get Out\u2019\n\nThe 39-year-old talks about an incident several years ago when he went to a trailer in the \u201cmiddle of nowhere\u201d as he was receiving training from a woman he labels a \u201cChristian witch.\u201d\n\nThe trailer sat on a plot of land that was said to have had a Native American burial ground underneath it. He said he entered the trailer and it was dark and he was trying to feel his way around and made it to a bedroom and sat on the bed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just kind of sitting there trying to feel things out and I felt the bed depress behind me like someone was standing on it and then I hear the words \u2018get out\u2019 whispered in my ear,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, I calmly stood up, and I walked out the front door and I got into the car next to the lady that was helping us. And she said, \u2018Are you OK?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018nope,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt scared me, oh man, it scared me.\u201d\n\nDale Killingbeck can be reached at dale@cowboystatedaily.com."

        "article_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe 2024 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine has been awarded to US scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their work on the discovery of microRNA, a molecule that governs how cells in the body function.\n\nTheir research revealed how genes, which contain the instruction manual for life, give rise to different types of cells within the human body, a process known as gene regulation.\n\nThe Nobel Prize committee announced the prestigious honor, seen as the pinnacle of scientific achievement, in Sweden on Monday. It praised the \u201cgroundbreaking discovery,\u201d which the committee said \u201crevealed an entirely new dimension to gene regulation.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of gene regulation by microRNA \u2013 a family of molecules that helps cells control the sort of proteins they make that has been at work for hundreds of millions of years \u2013 was the result of decades of work by Ambros, a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and Ruvkun, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\u201cTheir discovery\u2026 is of fundamental importance to understand how cells work, and thus how organisms develop,\u201d said Love Dal\u00e9n, a professor of evolutionary genomics at Stockholm University. \u201cThis finding was groundbreaking, and has affected more or less all fields of biology and medicine,\u201d he told CNN via email.\n\nNobel Committee Secretary General Thomas Perlmann speaks to the media in front of a picture of this year's laureates Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkum during the announcement of the Nobel Prize in medicine winners on Monday. Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHow cells do different things\n\n\u201cThe information stored within our chromosomes can be likened to an instruction manual for all cells in our body. Every cell contains the same chromosomes, so every cell contains exactly the same set of genes and exactly the same set of instructions,\u201d the committee said in a statement, detailing the duo\u2019s work.\n\nAnd yet, different cell types \u2013 such as muscle and nerve cells \u2013 have different characteristics. The two biologists have spent their careers investigating how these differences arise.\n\n\u201cThe answer lies in gene regulation, which allows each cell to select only the relevant instructions. This ensures that only the correct set of genes is active in each cell type,\u201d the committee said.\n\nGene regulation by microRNA has aided the evolution of increasingly complex organisms. If gene regulation goes awry, it can lead to cancer and other conditions found in humans and other animals, like hearing loss and skeletal disorders.\n\n\u201cMicroRNAs are very much implicated in cancer. There is ongoing research to make treatments or utilize micro RNAs \u2013 mimic microRNA or block microRNA \u2013 to treat cancer. There\u2019s some technical hurdles in that so there\u2019s not been any drugs yet,\u201d said Thomas Perlmann, secretary-general of the Nobel Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re awarding this because of its fundamental importance for the basic understanding of physiology. We know historically that these big discoveries, they translate into clinical improvements but it takes time,\u201d he added.\n\nFrom \u2018oddity\u2019 to fundamental discovery\n\nIn their early work, the pair studied the genetic make-up of a tiny 1 millimeter-long roundworm, C. elegans. Despite its small size, this worm possesses many specialized cell types, such as nerve and muscle cells, that are also found in larger, more complex animals, making it a useful model for investigating how tissues develop and mature in multicellular organisms.\n\n\u201cThe first micro RNA was discovered by Victor Ambros in 1993 but it was thought to be an oddity, peculiar to a small worm, C. elegans, for more than seven years,\u201d said Olle K\u00e4mpe, a professor in endocrinology at the Karolinksa Institutet and vice chair of the Nobel medicine committee.\n\nThat 1993 discovery was met by \u201cdeafening silence\u201d and initially thought irrelevant to humans, the committee said, until Ruvkun published his discovery of another microRNA, which is now known to be present throughout the animal kingdom.\n\n\u201cThen the field exploded,\u201d said K\u00e4mpe. \u201cNow, more than tens of thousands of microRNAs have been identified in different organisms.\u201d\n\nNobel recognition for Ambros and Ruvkun has been anticipated by many for years, said David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate\u2019s Institute for Scientific Information.\n\n\u201cThey (microRNAs) offer potential diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities in treating cancer and other diseases. Clinical trials are underway to utilize microRNA profiling for patient prognosis and clinical response,\u201d Pendlebury told CNN.\n\nJanosch Heller, an assistant professor in biomedical sciences at Dublin City University, said that the work \u201copened our eyes to the wonderful machinery that is tightly controlling what is happening in our cells.\u201d\n\nLast year, the prize was awarded to Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman for their work on MRNA vaccines, a crucial tool in curtailing the spread of Covid-19.\n\nThe prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million)."

        "article_content": "By Niklas Pollard, Ludwig Burger\n\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) -U.S. scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the discovery of microRNA and its crucial role in how multicellular organisms grow and live, the award-giving body said on Monday.\n\nThe Nobel assembly said in a statement that the laureates discovered the new class of tiny RNA molecules, which play a crucial role in gene regulation.\n\n\"Their groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans,\" the assembly said.\n\nTheir work helped explain how cells specialise and develop into different types, such as muscle and nerve cells, even though all the cells in an individual contain the same set of genes and instructions for growing and staying alive.\n\nThomas Perlmann, secretary of the Nobel committee for physiology, said he had reached Ruvkun by phone, waking him up early in the U.S. morning, but he was eventually happy and \"very enthusiastic\". He had not yet reached Ambros, he said.\n\n\"(Ruvkun's) wife answered. It took a long time till he came to the phone and he was very tired,\" Perlmann told a press conference.\n\nAmbros is a professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, while Ruvkun is a professor at Harvard Medical School and also affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Ambros and Ruvkun undertook postdoctorate studies in the laboratory of Robert Horvitz, himself a Nobel Prize winner in 2002, studying a 1 mm long roundworm.\n\nTheir discoveries on how certain microRNAs in the roundworm govern growth of organs and tissue was initially dismissed as specific to the species.\n\nMore work published by Ruvkun's research group in 2000, however, showed that all animal life had relied on the mechanism for more than 500 million years.\n\nBUILDING BLOCKS FOR LIFE\n\nMicroRNA comes into play when single-strand messenger RNA - the subject of last year's Nobel Prize in medicine - is decoded and translated into making proteins, the building blocks of all human and animal life.\n\nMessenger RNA, or mRNA, in turn, emerges from the universal blueprint in every cell nucleus, the double-helix DNA.\n\nThe winners of the prize for physiology or medicine are selected by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden's Karolinska Institute medical university and receive a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million).\n\nAs in every year, the physiology or medicine prize was the first in the crop of Nobels, arguably the most prestigious prizes in science, literature and humanitarian endeavour, with the remaining five set to be unveiled over the coming days.\n\nCreated in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel, the prizes have been awarded for breakthroughs in science, literature and peace since 1901, while economics is a later addition.\n\nPast winners of the Nobel medicine prize include many famous researchers such as Ivan Pavlov in 1904, most known for his experiments on behaviour using dogs, and Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 prize for the discovery of penicillin.\n\nLast year's medicine prize was awarded to the runaway favourites Katalin Kariko, a Hungarian scientist, and U.S. colleague Drew Weissman, for discoveries that paved the way for COVID-19 vaccines that helped curb the pandemic.\n\nSteeped in tradition, the science, literature and economics prizes are presented to the laureates in a ceremony on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death, followed by a lavish banquet at Stockholm city hall. Separate festivities attend the winner of the peace prize in Oslo on the same day.

        "article_content": "Listen to this story\n\nWith tools like Cursor, Claude, and ChatGPT canvas are on the boom, allowing users to build software using natural language, it feels highly reminiscent of the times when LC/NC platforms also lowered the barrier to entry for app development and made it easier for companies to teach their developers the existing solutions within the companies.\n\nThe community is now questioning the relevance of low-code/no-code (LC/NC) platforms in the AI era. How do these platforms continue to stay relevant in a landscape dominated by artificial intelligence?\n\nWhile these tools were a great choice for prototyping an idea or starting a project, LC/NC platforms are a nightmare when considering scaling a project, which seems to be the same for modern AI coding tools. Not much has changed.\n\nAmidst the challenges and shift towards AI coding tools, is there still a role for low-code, no-code platforms, like Bubble and Webflow, in today\u2019s landscape, and are they able to coexist with emerging AI solutions?\n\nAccording to a Reddit user, even when he got help from AI to write a custom function for the no-code platform, it failed terribly. Two days later, he started writing the code himself and it worked out pretty well.\n\n\u201cWhen building an app you want to own with popular low-code/no-code platforms, even if they mention that you legally own an IP to your app, what meaning does it hold if you cannot run it on-premise?\u201d Andreas M\u00f8ller, the co-founder of toddle, told AIM. This seems to be a common reason why the adoption of low-code no-code platforms took some time.\n\nWe witness the same with AI tools, given the hallucinations and other privacy issues. But in certain cases, they are able to do the job a lot quicker than any no-code platforms that ever existed.\n\nFor example, Meghana Jagadeesh, the founder & CEO of GoCodeo, mentioned at Cypher 2024 that LC/NC tools will still be relevant and will grow in the future, but with an AI twist in them.\n\n\u201cWhen AI capabilities are added to LC/NC platforms, it gets easier for non-tech guys to build specific functions. These tools are a great choice to get started before scaling it for a large user base,\u201d she said, suggesting that we should not confuse LC/NC tools with traditional development as they cater to different user needs.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have Git, a version-controlling system, I\u2019m obviously not going to build a big project on your platform. That is a deal breaker for every developer,\u201d said M\u00f8ller while explaining why it is necessary for every developer to have a version-control system to build a SaaS application.\n\nDue to these issues, we saw companies like Klarna drop solutions built on top of LC/NC platforms and create in-house solutions using AI for better scalability and profit.\n\nThis is the reason we are seeing tools like toddle and Apptile, which are a little different from the traditional LC/NC platforms. Samyam Annappa, founder and CTO at Apptile, told AIM that coding typically makes up less than 25% of the total project cost. Most of the time goes into setting up the infrastructure\u2014analytics pipelines, payment gateways, notifications, device testing, and managing both iOS and Android versions.\n\n\u201cThat is where tools like Apptile simplify this by taking care of the heavy lifting behind the scenes. Additionally, our architecture supports real-time content updates, unlike tools like Cursor, which necessitate code changes, App Store reviews, and App Store rejection handling for content updates,\u201d he added, further suggesting that to stay relevant in the AI era, LC/NC platforms must overcome traditional issues and offer streamlined solutions.\n\nSimilarly to Apptile, tools like toddle, which is not entirely an LC/NC platform but something in between LC/NC and traditional platforms, allows users to build specific functions and host your infrastructure, and has plans to go open source by the end of 2025, so you can actually own your software.\n\nWill LLMs replace LC/NC Platforms?\n\nLC/NC platforms have to adapt to the changes all developers are going through \u2013 the AI change. Jinen Dedhia, the founder of DronaHQ mentioned on HackerNews that he also believes that LLMs can remove the need for LC/NC platforms and the only way to stay relevant is to tightly integrate AI capabilities to LC/NC platforms.\n\n\u201cBut I do see the merit in this thinking that LLMs can eat LCNC platforms for breakfast. However, I am excited to see how with time near perfect applications can be churned out with about 80-90% work done and engineers can figure the last few miles and reach the finish line but 50x faster,\u201d he added further.\n\nIn fact, the LC/NC platforms produce very well-structured code behind the scenes and they can train LLMs to build apps following their well defined structure, which means their apps can still take advantage of the LLMs but will have less bugs than just letting the LLMs produce a stand-alone app.\n\nWhile LC/NC platforms may provide a simplified interface for creating applications, they do not eliminate the need for a foundational understanding of programming concepts, same as the AI tools like Cursor, ChatGPT, or GitHub Copilot.\n\nOf course, the LLMs can produce more versatile apps than LC/NC platforms but considering LLMs as a competitor to LC/NC platforms might not be a correct idea."
