This is similar to The Manhattan Project; this is the atomic weapon on steroids,\u201d says Jay Stratton, former director of the U.S. government\u2019s UAP task force.\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure is helmed by filmmaker Dan Farah and will premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival in the Paramount Theatre in March. The film\u2019s producers are currently in talks to get the movie commercial distribution."

            "article_content": "A s a health journalist, I know how difficult it can be to find accurate health information online. In the age of AI-powered search engines, you never quite know if the answers served up to you at the top of the page are from legitimate medical sources or some woo-woo wellness site that hasn't been touched in years. Even in my personal life, it can be tricky to find resources about the conditions I may face as a woman\u2014and I know I'm not alone in that experience.\n\nFrom menstruation to fertility, and yes, even to menopause, there's still so much mystery surrounding women's health. Case in point: More than 1 million Americans go through menopause each year, but studies find that 80 percent of those people have limited knowledge about menopause, never learned about it in school, or have a negative attitude toward the life phase altogether. No wonder so many of us are too embarrassed to bring up our concerns at the OB/GYN, which can lead to gaps in quality care.\n\nThis is where AI\u2014and personalized health advice in the form of an app\u2014can be useful. Meet Roon, an app that partners world-class healthcare providers with artificial intelligence to bridge the divide between people and reliable health information. Recently, Roon launched Roon Menopause\u2014a platform that serves as a digital library for all the menopause questions you may have, from how to tame a hot flash to navigating hormone therapy, with answers from real-life medical experts.\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with Roon CEO and co-founder Vikram Bhaskaran to learn more about the launch. Here's what to expect once you hit download on iOS.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nFirst, what is Roon?\n\nRoon is an app that puts free, expert-driven resources on several health conditions at your fingertips. Conditions featured on the app include ALS, dementia, endometriosis, fertility, glioblastoma, PCOS, and now, menopause. The app was born when Bhaskaran, a former tech developer with Pinterest, became a caregiver for his father with ALS and noticed a disturbing lack of information about the illness online.\n\n\"Like most caregivers on the planet, I spent thousands of hours on Dr. Google, Facebook groups, Instagram, and TikTok to try to find medically vetted information,\" Bhaskaran says. \"When it comes to health, it sometimes feels like we are still in the dark ages.\" But between how long it takes to see a specialist, plus providers only spending about 18 minutes on average with patients per appointment, Bhaskaran says it only makes sense that we turn to the Internet for help.\n\nUsing his tech-savvy and appreciation for beautiful, algorithm-driven apps like Pinterest, Bhaskaran teamed up with his co-founder Rohan Ramakrishna, MD, a neurosurgeon at Weill Cornell, engineers, and designers to develop Roon, which houses hundreds of pre-recorded videos of healthcare providers answering the top questions they get asked every day.\n\nOn top of that, users can also take advantage of the \"ask a question\" search tool to find answers, all with the help of AI technology. (More on this below.)\n\nHow Roon uses AI to provide health information\n\nInstead of gathering answers from all over the Internet like other AI-powered search engines, Roon's \"ask a question\" AI tool only pulls quotes from the pre-recorded content that exists within the app. This ensures you're getting accurate and reliable answers straight from a professional each time you search, and not some unknown source.\n\nOnce your question has been answered, the AI tool auto-populates related questions, which is how the personalization takes shape. \"The more you use it, the more we learn about you so we can ultimately become your personalized guide for health,\" says Bhaskaran. Plus, if you add your age and gender identity, \"we can also personalize content based on where you are in your journey,\" he adds. So, for example, if you're a 40-year-old female who's trying to get pregnant, it might suggest you watch perimenopause or fertility content.\n\nWhile this service doesn't replace the need for real visits with your healthcare provider, it could help those with a lack of access to quality care or insufficient health insurance feel more empowered\u2014and less confused\u2014about their well-being. \"In the age of AI-generated content, we're going the opposite way, which is there's nothing more human than a doctor looking into a camera answering your question when you're going through a hard journey,\" Bhaskaran adds.\n\nOther Roon Menopause features\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about Roon Menopause is its user-friendliness. No matter your level of tech skill, the simple design makes it fairly easy to sift through each tab and section. You can start searching for information based on the type of expert you want to hear from (like a reproductive endocrinologist, OB/GYN, or holistic practitioner), the symptoms you're experiencing (like vaginal dryness, fatigue, or insomnia), co-occurring conditions you may have (like osteoporosis or depression), or other topics, like treatments, diagnosis, causes, and more.\n\nOnce you find a topic you're interested in, you can watch short videos or read written responses from a variety of providers, who Bhaskaran says are not only heavily vetted before joining the app, but are also great communicators with good bedside manner IRL. Some notable names include Mindy Goldman, MD, the chief clinical officer at MIDI Health, Corrine Menn, MD, with Alloy Women's Health, and Rajita Patil, MD, a menopause specialist at UCLA Health, among others.\n\nFrom there, the AI feature will suggest other topics or questions you might ask. Consider it a personal search engine and doctor-filled social feed all in one.\n\nAnd we're not just talking about physical health here: Roon Menopause also spans the mental, emotional, and sexual wellness aspects of menopause. So you may explore topics like \"how to comfortably have sex with vaginal dryness,\" \"how to talk to your partner about menopause,\" or \"how to start your fertility treatment if you're also in perimenopause.\" It also offers tips for optimal nutrition, exercise, holistic vs. traditional medicine practices, and specific treatment options for each menopause symptom you're facing.\n\nHere's more of a breakdown of the features:\n\nExpert network of over 60 licensed healthcare providers\n\nThousands of pre-recorded Q&A videos and written content\n\nApproximately 1,300 answered questions\n\nOver 100 related subtopics\n\nInstant answers through an AI-powered search tool\n\nAdvice from people with lived experience\n\nMultiple expert perspectives on highly debated treatment options (such as hormone therapy)\n\nCulturally sensitive and trauma-informed content\n\nNext-step advice for receiving care\n\nUltimately, Bhaskaran says this service is a safe place to ask the hard questions or ones you may be too uncomfortable to ask your provider about. \"This is just the beginning of how we'll support women across their lifetime health journeys through expert guidance,\" he adds.\n\nYes, it's personal, but is your data safe?\n\nWithin the last few years, some people have shied away from using period tracking apps for fear that their reproductive health information will be shared and sold to third parties or that it would be used against them at healthcare facilities or in legal proceedings. This is because period trackers can not only log menstruation, but also missed periods, miscarriages, and infertility.\n\nBut rest assured that with Roon, the private details you share about your reproductive health stay within the app, and are only used to further optimize your experience, says Bhaskaran. Data is stored locally and never shared with third parties.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThere's nothing more comforting than having a trusted healthcare provider's advice by your side\u2014especially during a time like menopause. Whether you're already in it, about to start, or know a loved one currently going through the life phase, apps like Roon Menopause\u2014which combines AI with medically sound information\u2014can cut through the noise, misinformation, or even medical gaslighting you may face, both online and in person.\n\nAdditional Sources + Well+Good articles reference scientific, reliable, recent, robust studies to back up the information we share.

Still, an estimated 1.3 million new HIV infections were reported around the world in 2023, with 630,000 related deaths, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nRelated Articles Science | Biden health officials say they built up US pandemic defenses.

But there is no cure for HIV or AIDS or a vaccine for human use to prevent infection.\n\nOne of the labs involved in current research to design such a vaccine is at La Jolla-based Scripps Research, which recently made a discovery that could drive development of the vaccine.\n\nMany vaccines work by introducing a protein to the body that resembles part of a virus. Ideally, the immune system will produce long-lasting antibodies recognizing that virus, thereby providing protection.\n\nBut Scripps Research scientists said they have found that for some HIV vaccines, something else happens. After a few applications, the immune system begins to produce antibodies against immune complexes already bound to the viral protein.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique reaction in which antibodies bind to other antibodies, which is rare,\u201d said Scripps researcher Sharidan Brown, first author of a study published Jan. 17 in Science Immunology. \u201cOver the course of multiple immunizations [in animals], we have found four classes of antibodies that cling to other antibodies. They are unique responses, so by understanding the structure for the first time, we are put on the right foot to understand these better and can harness them for not only HIV vaccine design but other therapeutics.\u201d\n\nThe observation came about when researchers in the lab of Andrew Ward, a professor of integrative structural and computational biology at Scripps Research, was using advanced imaging tools to study how antibodies evolve after multiple HIV vaccine doses. A technique the lab invented, known as Electron Microscopy-Based Polyclonal Epitope Mapping, or EMPEM, let the researchers see exactly where on the virus antibodies bind.\n\nWhen they carried out the experiments on blood from animals that had received multiple doses of an experimental HIV vaccine, they discovered that some of the antibodies were not binding directly to the HIV viral antigen but to immune molecules on its surface.\n\nIt isn\u2019t yet known whether this binding is a good thing in designing an effective vaccine, but Brown said future studies should answer that question.\n\n\u201cIt adds to our understanding of what these vaccines are capable of eliciting,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe don\u2019t fully know what these antibodies do yet, but by understanding and future experiments looking into why they get elicited and what they do, we can adjust vaccine studies to make them more effective by either harnessing or getting rid of it.\n\n\u201cIt could be a good thing [that the antibodies bind together] because it could give the immune system a bigger set of antibodies. Or it could be detrimental in that it is not making antibodies the body needs.\u201d\n\nShe and others in the lab \u201care excited to see where these antibodies fit into the immune response and the body\u2019s ability to fight off HIV,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could lead to redesigning vaccines to target or eliminate these responses and could lead to better vaccines.\u201d\n\nImplementation of any vaccine stemming from this discovery is years away from human trials, but Brown said an effective vaccine would have a great impact.\n\n\u201cThere are still millions of people diagnosed with HIV, so having a vaccine would impact the lives of people around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a vaccine that prevents infection would be instrumental in reducing the spread. Right now, there are no vaccines in use in humans. There are clinical trials in humans, which is exciting, and we have made a lot of progress toward eliciting the types of antibodies with these vaccines in the past five years or so. This [discovery] is an extra data point to think about when we design these vaccines and could help us better design boosting immunizations.\u201d\n\nBrown, a native of Montana, \u201cwhere I fell in love with science,\u201d said she came to Scripps Research for her Ph.D. studies and was placed in her current lab to research immunology and structural biology.\n\n\u201cI feel super lucky to work in the lab I do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have such a diverse, large lab of people full of amazing ideas.\u201d\n\nThe next step for the lab is to look at the antibody responses in other models.\n\n\u201cWe want to understand how they are generated and what they do, and any consequences to these antibodies being around,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThen we can modify these types of responses in vaccine design.\u201d \u2666"

Operator is a web app that can carry out simple online tasks in a browser, such as booking concert tickets or filling an online grocery order. The app is powered by a new model called Computer-Using Agent\u2014CUA for short\u2014built on top of OpenAI\u2019s multimodal large language model GPT-4o.\n\n\n\nWhy it matters: OpenAI claims that Operator outperforms similar rival tools, including Anthropic\u2019s Computer Use and Google DeepMind\u2019s Mariner. The fact that three of the world\u2019s top AI firms have converged on the same vision of what agent-based models could be makes one thing clear. The battle for AI supremacy has a new frontier\u2014and it\u2019s our computer screens.

Some are upbeat and vocally hopeful that a future is just around the corner in which machines can expertly handle much of what is currently done by humans, from cooking to surgery. Others are scared: of job losses, injuries, and whatever problems may come up as we try to live side by side.\n\n\n\nThe final camp, which I think is the largest, is just unimpressed. We\u2019ve been sold lots of promises that robots will transform society ever since the first robotic arm was installed on an assembly line at a General Motors plant in New Jersey in 1961. Few of those promises have panned out so far.\n\nBut this year, there\u2019s reason to think that even those staunchly in the \u201cbored\u201d camp will be intrigued by what\u2019s happening in the robot races. Here\u2019s a glimpse at what to keep an eye on this year. Read the full story."

            "article_content": "Andrew Pavlo\u2019s annual retrospective on the database world has recently been released, covering trends and innovations from the past year. The opinionated report, \"Databases in 2024: A Year in Review,\" highlights that while we may indeed be in the \"golden era of databases,\" last year brought significant license changes, the rapid growth of DuckDB, and some surprising new releases.\n\nDiscussing the \"turbulent\" year for open source databases, including major license changes for Redis and Elasticsearch, Pavlo writes:\n\nNotice that Redis and Elasticsearch are receiving more backlash compared to other systems that made similar moves. (...) It cannot be because the Redis and Elasticsearch install base is so much larger than these other systems (...) since the number of MongoDB and Kafka installations was equally as large when they switched their licenses. In the case of Redis, I can only think that people perceive Redis Ltd. as unfairly profiting off others' work since the company's founders were not the system's original creators.\n\nSimilar to how Postgres has emerged as the default choice for operational databases in recent years, DuckDB has, according to the 2024 article, \"entered the zeitgeist as the default choice for running analytical queries on data.\" This trend justifies the recent release of four different extensions integrating the OLAP database with Postgres, as Pavlo explains:\n\nMost OLAP queries do not access that much data. Fivetran analyzed traces from Snowflake and Redshift and showed that the median amount of data scanned by queries is only 100 MB. Such a small amount of data means a single DuckDB instance is enough for most to handle most queries.\n\nAn associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former co-founder of OtterTune, Pavlo began publishing an annual analysis in 2021, focusing on the dominance of PostgreSQL. In 2022, the main topic was \"Blockchain databases are still a stupid idea,\" while in 2023, he shifted focus to the rise of vector databases.\n\nThe 2024 retrospective by the database management systems expert garnered significant attention, sparking popular threads on Reddit and Hacker News. An opinionated statement (\"I don't care for Redis. It is slow, it has fake transactions, and its query syntax is a freakshow.\") ignited a heated exchange on Hacker News with Redis creator Salvatore Sanfilippo, better known as \"antirez,\" about the importance and design of the once open-source key-value store.\n\nFocusing on major releases, the retrospective highlights Microsoft Garnet and Valkey as notable key-value stores. Pavlo, however, expresses disappointment with the feature list in MySQL v9 and views the retirement of Amazon QLDB as significant:\n\nIf Amazon can't figure out how to make money on a blockchain database, then nobody can.\n\nDiscussing the recent Aurora DSQL preview, he adds:\n\nThis announcement shows you how much brand recognition the name \"Aurora\" carries in the database world because AWS used it for this new DBMS that seemingly shares no code with their flagship Aurora Postgres RDS offering.\n\nFollowing Pavlo's lead, the team at ByteBase recently released \"Database Tools in 2024: A Year in Review\". Many of Pavlo\u2019s university lessons, along with his recent talk \"What Goes Around Comes Around... And Around\u2026,\" are available on YouTube."

With the recent recovery and derivatives traders holding their positions firm, ETH could complete a 20% rally if it overcomes a symmetrical triangle resistance.\n\nEthereum on-chain metrics reveal impact of ETH's bearish sentiment\n\nEthereum faced one of its highest negative sentiment volumes in the past few days.\n\nCommunity members blasted the Ethereum Foundation's leadership and criticized its priorities following Solana's rally upon hosting the TRUMP meme coin. The criticism potentially saw investors jumping ship into other assets, as evidenced by key trends in ETH's on-chain metrics:\n\nEthereum exchange reserve, which measures the total amount of ETH on exchanges, increased by over 434,000 ETH in the past nine days, following the high negative sentiment surrounding the top altcoin. An increase in the amount of coins held in exchanges indicates higher selling pressure.\n\nETH Exchange Reserve. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nA similar trend is evident in ETH's total value staked, which declined to a six-month low of 34.15 million ETH. A decline in total value staked signifies investors are not opting to hold ETH over the long term and could quickly sell off their assets during periods of high volatility.\n\nETH Total Value Staked. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nNotably, the bearish pressure that saw ETH briefly decline below $3,200 came from both short-term and long-term holders considering the Dormant Circulation across both cohorts saw a slight uptick. Dormant Circulation measures the amount of coins within specific age cohorts that switched addresses.\n\nETH Dormant Circulation. Source: Santiment\n\nHowever, periods of high negative sentiment for top crypto assets have often coincided with a price bottom. This could partly explain why ETH has quickly recovered and risen above the $3,300 level in the past 24 hours.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum's futures open interest saw a slight increase in the past two days, reaching an all-time high of 9.50 million ETH on Friday.\n\nEthereum Open Interest. Source: Coinglass\n\nOpen interest is the total amount of unsettled contracts in a derivatives market.\n\nDespite the negativity surrounding ETH, its open interest was fairly stable, indicating derivatives traders maintained their positions.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) ended their six-day inflow streak after recording net outflows of $14.90 million on Thursday, per Coinglass data.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast: ETH eyes move above symmetrical triangle and $3,550 resistance\n\nEthereum experienced $35.24 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of liquidated long and short positions accounted for $13.95 and $21.29 million, respectively.\n\nOn the 8-hour chart, Ethereum bounced off a symmetrical triangle's lower boundary support line. Notably, ETH has struggled near the 200-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) in the past nine days before seeing a 4% rise on Friday.\n\nETH/USDT 8-hour chart\n\nOn the upside, ETH faces the upper boundary resistance of a symmetrical triangle \u2014 strengthened by the 100-day SMA. If ETH clears this hurdle and flips the $3,550 resistance to a support level, it could rally nearly 20% to tackle the $4,100 critical resistance.\n\nOn the downside, ETH could find support near the $3,000 psychological level if it declines below the triangle's lower boundary support line. A sustained move below $3,000 will validate a Head-and-Shoulders (H&S) pattern that could spark a mega-bearish trend for ETH.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are above their neutral levels, indicating rising bullish pressure."

            "article_content": "This coin hoard was deposited during the 15th century and contains hundreds of Venetian and Mamluk coins.\n\nArchaeologists have discovered a hoard of gold and silver coins by the remains of a centuries-old synagogue in Israel, near the Sea of Galilee.\n\nThe hoard of 364 coins, which was unearthed at the archaeological site of Huqoq (also spelled Yaquq), dates to the 15th century.\n\nThe team found the stash within two jugs under the collapsed wall of the synagogue. Most of the coins are from medieval Venice or the Mamluk sultanate, which controlled the region at the time. It's unclear why the jugs were filled with coins and left at the site, Robert Kool , a curator in the Israel Antiquities Authority's coin department, wrote in a paper published in the latest issue of the American Journal of Numismatics .\n\nThe earliest of the Venetian coins dates to the time that Francesco Dandolo was doge (leader of Venice), between 1329 and 1339, while the latest Venetian coins date to the reign of Francesco Foscari, from 1423 to 1457, Kool wrote. Many of the Venetian coins have images depicting St. Mark the Evangelist, who is traditionally ascribed as the author of the Gospel of Mark, as well as Latin inscriptions that can be translated as \"It is to You, Christ, that this Duchy is entrusted which You govern,\" Kool wrote.\n\nDuring medieval times in the eastern Mediterranean, Venetian coins were widely used as an export currency. \"By the end of the fourteenth century [Venetian] ducats were the only European gold currency accepted in Mamluk Egypt and Syria,\" Kool wrote in the study.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tal Rogovski) The coin hoard when it was first discovered. Why it was deposited near the medieval synagogue is a mystery. (Image credit: Tal Rogovski) One of the gold coins found at the archaeaological site of Huqoq.\n\nMost of the Mamluk coins in the hoard were minted during the reign of Sultan al-Ashraf Barsbay, from 1422 to 1438, Kool wrote. There are also a few coins from other locations in Southern Europe, such as a silver coin minted during the reign of James I, who was king of Sicily from 1285 to 1295, and even a coin from Serbia.\n\nThe \"deposition of the hoard occurred sometime during or after 1438-1457,\" a date range that is based on analysis of the coins and other archaeological remains, Kool wrote in the paper. Who deposited it, where they got the money from, and why it was left at the synagogue are all unknown.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

It could have been money donated for repairs to the synagogue, or perhaps the hoard was deposited by a traveling merchant who left it there for safekeeping and never came back, Kool wrote. Yet another possibility is that the coins were left by pilgrims traveling to the tomb of Habakkuk, a prophet mentioned in the Hebrew Bible who lived in the seventh century B.C.This tomb is located near Huqoq.\n\nThe building stopped being used as a synagogue in the mid-15th century, Kool noted. After that, the building fell into ruin."

            "article_content": "Andrew Pavlo\u2019s annual retrospective on the database world has recently been released, covering trends and innovations from the past year. The opinionated report, \"Databases in 2024: A Year in Review,\" highlights that while we may indeed be in the \"golden era of databases,\" last year brought significant license changes, the rapid growth of DuckDB, and some surprising new releases.\n\nDiscussing the \"turbulent\" year for open source databases, including major license changes for Redis and Elasticsearch, Pavlo writes:\n\nNotice that Redis and Elasticsearch are receiving more backlash compared to other systems that made similar moves. (...) It cannot be because the Redis and Elasticsearch install base is so much larger than these other systems (...) since the number of MongoDB and Kafka installations was equally as large when they switched their licenses. In the case of Redis, I can only think that people perceive Redis Ltd. as unfairly profiting off others' work since the company's founders were not the system's original creators.\n\nSimilar to how Postgres has emerged as the default choice for operational databases in recent years, DuckDB has, according to the 2024 article, \"entered the zeitgeist as the default choice for running analytical queries on data.\" This trend justifies the recent release of four different extensions integrating the OLAP database with Postgres, as Pavlo explains:\n\nMost OLAP queries do not access that much data. Fivetran analyzed traces from Snowflake and Redshift and showed that the median amount of data scanned by queries is only 100 MB. Such a small amount of data means a single DuckDB instance is enough for most to handle most queries.\n\nAn associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former co-founder of OtterTune, Pavlo began publishing an annual analysis in 2021, focusing on the dominance of PostgreSQL. In 2022, the main topic was \"Blockchain databases are still a stupid idea,\" while in 2023, he shifted focus to the rise of vector databases.\n\nThe 2024 retrospective by the database management systems expert garnered significant attention, sparking popular threads on Reddit and Hacker News. An opinionated statement (\"I don't care for Redis. It is slow, it has fake transactions, and its query syntax is a freakshow.\") ignited a heated exchange on Hacker News with Redis creator Salvatore Sanfilippo, better known as \"antirez,\" about the importance and design of the once open-source key-value store.\n\nFocusing on major releases, the retrospective highlights Microsoft Garnet and Valkey as notable key-value stores. Pavlo, however, expresses disappointment with the feature list in MySQL v9 and views the retirement of Amazon QLDB as significant:\n\nIf Amazon can't figure out how to make money on a blockchain database, then nobody can.\n\nDiscussing the recent Aurora DSQL preview, he adds:\n\nThis announcement shows you how much brand recognition the name \"Aurora\" carries in the database world because AWS used it for this new DBMS that seemingly shares no code with their flagship Aurora Postgres RDS offering.\n\nFollowing Pavlo's lead, the team at ByteBase recently released \"Database Tools in 2024: A Year in Review\". Many of Pavlo\u2019s university lessons, along with his recent talk \"What Goes Around Comes Around... And Around\u2026,\" are available on YouTube."

            "article_content": "Value Stream Management (VSM) was all the rage a few years ago, but now there\u2019s a new contender for measuring how much value software is driving: Software Engineering Intelligence.\n\n\u201cWhile Value Stream Management continued to lose steam in 2024, we also saw the fast emergence of Software Engineering Intelligence (SEI) to take its place,\u201d Derek Holt, CEO of Digital.ai, told SD Times while making predictions for 2025.\n\nHolt was interviewed in the most recent episode of our podcast to talk more about this trend, explaining that SEI is the application of both data driven insights and predictive AI to measure and improve not only the process of delivering software, but also the outcomes of that software development.\n\n\u201cThis includes both rear view metrics of how things have trended in the past, but also looks at predictive insights to be able to identify areas for improvement, risk avoidance, etc,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the rear view mirror is smaller than the windshield in a car, and we think it is that balance of both views that are going to help organizations just get better and better at predictably, building and delivering great software.\u201d\n\nThere are a couple of different reasons why Holt believes SEI will gain more traction in the year ahead.\n\nFirst, organizations are continuing to look at how to mature the way they build and deliver software.\n\nSecond, there is pressure on companies to adopt AI in their software development process, but they don\u2019t necessarily have the data to justify whether or not AI has resulted or will result in improvements.\n\nThird, we now have the technology stack needed to gather structured and unstructured data from third-party tools and provide it in a dashboard and perform predictive insights on that data.\n\nLooking back to VSM, it really was designed to help answer two questions:\n\nHow good are we at building software? How good is the software we build right now?\n\n\u201cI know those are a lot of the same words, but they\u2019re wildly different things,\u201d Holt explained. \u201cI could be really great at building, let\u2019s say, a new smartphone, but if the smartphone isn\u2019t wanted by anybody, it doesn\u2019t really matter that I was good at building it. And at the same time, I could have the best idea for the next generation smartphone, but if I don\u2019t have a way to get the parts, manufacturing, and distribution, that idea is not worth a lot either.\u201d\n\nHolt believes that SEI is a part of the overall vision for VSM. It\u2019s not a complete departure from VSM, but rather a recognition of that first question.\n\nHe explained that development teams often have an easier time understanding how good they are at building software, and a harder time understanding the value they derive from that software, as that can vary based on business model, business strategy, market conditions, etc.\n\nHolt also emphasized that it\u2019s not an \u201ceither or\u201d when it comes to VSM vs SEI. \u201cI think it\u2019s a subset, and hopefully we continue to build towards the original vision of value stream management, just in a kind of a step function over time.\u201d\n\nFor teams looking to implement SEI, Holt says there are a few prerequisites. First, whatever vendors they\u2019re working with need to have ways to pull data from those systems, as no singular data source can provide that 360 degree view that is needed.\n\nAnother important foundation is the ability to scale. \u201cThese things are easy to demo,\u201d Holt said. \u201cThey\u2019re harder to scale across an enterprise. So I would really encourage folks, as they\u2019re doing evaluations, to make sure that they\u2019re partnering with folks that have done this at scale. And that\u2019s not just scale of data, it\u2019s also scale of users, scale of continuing to mature \u2026 getting value right away, but also then expanding the purview in terms of the types of intelligence that you\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\nHe also went on to say that it\u2019s important to have that 360 degree view so that you can ensure you\u2019re not only able to look back, but also predict future outcomes.\n\nHis final piece of advice is to not overanalyze the options in a way that prevents you from getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very easy to look at this space and to spend a year debating and having a bit of analysis paralysis \u2026 But the very first view you get, the very first aggregation of multiple data sources that gives you insights into your business, even just one is better than where you were before. And so this is a journey, not a destination, and a key piece there is taking that first step. So I would just encourage folks to get started instead of waiting for perfection.\u201d"

            "article_content": "OpenAI announced a preview of Operator, an artificial intelligence agent, that will collaborate with a wide range of commerce-driven companies. While still early, analysts believe these agents could drive engagement shifts across the Internet, while adding that details of the product and its partners remove a key overhang for online travel agencies. Analysts also expect advancements in agentic capabilities to continue, as well as further product expansion from Google (GOOGL), Meta (META) and others.\n\nInvest with Confidence: Follow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return.\n\nJoin thousands of data-driven investors \u2013 Build your Smart Portfolio for personalized insights.\n\nOPERATOR: OpenAI announced on Thursday that it is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose artificial intelligence agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions and tasks. Using its own browser, it can look at a webpage and interact with it by typing, clicking, and scrolling, OpenAI said in a blog post. Operator is coming to U.S. users on ChatGPT\u2019s $200 Pro subscription plan first, the company said. It plans to expand Operator to Plus, Team and Enterprise users and integrate its capabilities directly into ChatGPT in the future once it is \u201cconfidence in its safety and usability at scale.\u201d\n\nOpenAI explained that \u201cOperator can be asked to handle a wide variety of repetitive browser tasks such as filling out forms, ordering groceries, and even creating memes. The ability to use the same interfaces and tools that humans interact with on a daily basis broadens the utility of AI, helping people save time on everyday tasks while opening up new engagement opportunities for businesses.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S NOTABLE: Operator directly competes with an earlier release from Anthropic, the Amazon (AMZN)-backed artificial intelligence startup behind the Claude chatbot.\n\nThe generative AI market includes OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as Amazon, Google, Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta. Google is investing a further $1B into OpenAI competitor Anthropic, The Financial Times\u2019 George Hammond, Madhumitda Murgia, and Arash Massoudi reported this week. Google had already committed about $2B to Anthropic and is now increasing its stake in the group, according to four people with knowledge of the situation. Under outgoing commissioner Lina Khan, the FTC had targeted investments from Google and Amazon into Anthropic and Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI, reviewing the impact of the deals on competition, but Khan is stepping down in the coming weeks, the FT noted.\n\nANALYST COMMENTARY: In its 2025 outlook, Morgan Stanley discussed how it expects to see key developments in agentic offerings in 2025 and one month into the year \u201cwe have already seen releases from OpenAI and Perplexity.\u201d Google has also previewed agentic/reasoning capabilities with Deep Research, Project Astra, Project Mariner and in travel both in its Gemini 2.0 release and at Google I/O 2024, and Meta has spoken to significant opportunities for the creation of agentic AI systems with advanced reasoning. While still early days, with continued technological and cost improvements in reinforcement learning, chain of thought, and test time compute, the firm expects advancements in agentic capabilities to continue. It also expects further product expansion from Google, Meta and others.\n\nSaying that the new OpenAI agent is a best-case outcome for online travel agencies, Jefferies said that while rumors of the announcement contributed to high single digit downside for Booking and Expedia (EXPE) in recent days on fears of disintermediation, the details provided on Friday helped soothe those fears given that OpenAI\u2019s list of partners included Booking. The partnerships support the firm\u2019s view that AI agents will eventually be another performance channel that could help consolidate share around scaled Internet names. Jefferies said the announcement from OpenAI removes a key OTA overhang and suggests a path for OTA market share gains.\n\nAlso commenting on OpenAI\u2019s Operator, JPMorgan noted that the company is collaborating with a wide range of commerce-driven companies, including DoorDash (DASH), Instacart (CART), Booking (BKNG), Uber (UBER), eBay (EBAY), TripAdvisor (TRIP), and others. The firm believes that, for now, it is also blocked by a number of services, including Google\u2019s YouTube and Reddit (RDDT). While it is still \u201cvery early\u201d and much depends on how Operator and others improve over time, JPMorgan believes these agents could drive engagement shifts across the Internet, with a mix of positive and negative implications across its coverage universe.\n\nThough currently only in previews, BofA expects OpenAI\u2019s Operator could become available more broadly potentially later this year for those paying $20/month. During testing, users still need to input passwords, confirm significant actions, and approve high-stakes transactions, so the firm doesn\u2019t expect an immediate impact. OpenAI will also publish its model so that developers build their own Computer Using Agents. BofA believes OpenAI\u2019s collaborations with DoorDash, Uber, and Instacart are in the early stages, but could possibly deepen in the long-term and allow for more streamlined ordering or additional services."

Ukraine has ramped up drone production over the past year and now routinely fires large volleys."

Thousands have been displaced, exacerbating an existing humanitarian crisis and prompting fears of an all-out regional war.\n\nHere is what to know about the fighting:\n\nExplosions from Goma's outskirts have been reverberating across the city of 2 million people this week. Schools and stores are closed and police are out in full force. Military checkpoints, erected overnight, stop and check all vehicles.\n\nOn Friday, the governor of eastern Congo\u2019s North Kivu province, where Goma is the provincial capital, died of wounds sustained on the front line. The circumstances of Maj. Gen Peter Cirimwami's death were not immediately known \u2014 he was visiting troops fighting the rebels when he was wounded.\n\nOn Thursday, the rebels seized Sake, a town only 27 kilometers (16 miles) from Goma, sending panic surging as concerns mounted that the city could soon fall. Earlier in the week, they captured Minova, a strategically important port on the shores of Lake Kivu, and also the towns of Katale and Masisi, west of Goma.\n\nMost of the fighting between the Congolese army and the rebels on Friday was focused on Kibumba, a town about 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Goma, and also around Sake.\n\nThe M23 rebels \u2014 or The March 23 Movement \u2014 is one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region in a decades-long conflict in eastern Congo. In recent weeks, the rebels have made significant territorial gains, seizing towns and villages and encircling Goma.\n\nThe group was created in 2012 after the failed integration of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army. It claims to defend Tutsi from discrimination but critics say it's a pretext for Rwanda to obtain economic and political influence over eastern Congo.\n\n\u201cStudies have long highlighted the smuggling of resources\" from Congo into Rwanda, said Ladd Serwat, senior Africa analyst with U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. \u201cCongolese officials increasingly accuse Rwanda of pursuing control over the region\u2019s resources and aiming to annex parts\u201d of Congo.\n\nIn territories under its control, M23 implements its own tax system, runs a local government and controls natural resources.\n\nCongo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing the M23, which had only hundreds of members in 2021. Now, according to the United Nations, the group has around 6,500 fighters.\n\nWhile Rwanda denies that claim, it acknowledged last year that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo, allegedly to safeguard its security. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo.\n\nSerwat, the Africa analyst, says that Rwanda's engagement has brought it into direct conflict with Congolese forces, \u201cescalating political tensions\u201d between the neighbors.\n\nA \u201cdeclaration of war\" by Congo against Rwanda would risk turning \"into a regional conflict in East Africa,\u201d said Darren Davids, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency says more than 400,000 people have been displaced in eastern Congo since the beginning of the year, exacerbating \u201cdesperate conditions\u201d in severely overcrowded displacement centers in and around Goma and triggering an increase in cholera cases.\n\nJean Claude Bauma, 35, fled Masisi when M23 overran the town and was staying with his family at the Nzulo camp for the displaced on the outskirts of Goma. But relentless shelling near the camp forced the father of five to flee into the city center this week.\n\n\u201cWe fear for our lives, since the birth of my children, we have been fleeing the war,\u201d Bauma told the AP. \u201cThis time ... if it\u2019s to die, I will die here.\u201d\n\nThe city is a regional hub for trade, security and humanitarian efforts, and its airport is key for transporting supplies.\n\nBack in 2012, the rebels seized Goma and controlled it for about a week but after mounting international pressure on Rwanda \u2014 including suspension of aid from the United States and Britain \u2014 the M23 surrendered the city.\n\nSince 2021, Congo\u2019s government and allied forces, including Burundian troops and U.N. troops, have been keeping the rebels away from Goma.\n\n\u201cThe capture of such a large city\u201d will certainly be a huge boost for the rebels and a major defeat of the government forces, said Davids, the economist.\n\nIts fall would also have a \u201ccatastrophic impact on hundreds of thousands of civilians, putting them at risk of heightened exposure to human rights violations and abuses,\u201d said Ravina Shamdasani of the U.N. human rights office.\n\nFrancois Moreillon, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross for Congo, said he's worried also that ICRC staff running the main hospital in Goma would have to evacuate. If the hospital and the staff were no longer safe, who would treat the patients, he asked.\n\n\"This situation is simply unacceptable,\u201d Moreillon said."

Meanwhile, FOB China prices for n-type M10 and G12 wafers experienced slight increases, reaching $0.149/pc and $0.196/pc, respectively, reflecting a growth of 2.05% and 1.55% compared to the previous week.\n\nSince the start of 2025, n-type wafer prices have risen for three consecutive weeks, driven by production cuts and lower inventory levels. Large-scale production cuts by wafer companies since Q3 2024 have effectively reduced market inventory to about two weeks of production, significantly lower than the inventory levels of polysilicon and modules.\n\nThese developments have led wafer companies to raise their operating rates since early January, with the overall average now exceeding 50%. As a result, January wafer output is expected to reach approximately 46 GW, up 5.5% from 43.61 GW in October 2024.\n\nThe sustainability of the wafer price increase depends on a potential rebound in solar cell transaction prices, industry participants note. They also caution that wafer operating rates in the coming weeks will be critical. A significant rise in operating rates driven by higher prices could risk price drops after the Chinese New Year, as the current vast production capacity may quickly drive inventory levels back to high levels.\n\nAnother recent trend in the Chinese market is the sluggish sales of rectangular G12R (182 mm x 210 mm) wafers, which have driven prices downward. Sources attribute this to the rapid production ramp-up of this size across both upstream and downstream segments, surpassing its adoption by end users. Consequently, an oversupply of this specification has developed before it could gain traction as a mainstream product.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security expanded its ban list of China-based entities, adding four ingot and wafer manufacturers, including a subsidiary of a prominent solar integrated manufacturer. The action was taken on the grounds that these entities were found to source polysilicon from regions in China that do not comply with traceability requirements.\n\nInsiders widely believe that this U.S. decision will theoretically support increased demand for global polysilicon, though its impact has not yet been fully realized. It is also expected to further hinder the export of Chinese wafers and the modules derived from these wafer suppliers to the U.S. With these manufacturers excluded from the U.S. export market, reduced competition may stabilize or even increase wafer and module prices in the U.S. This move aligns with prior market expectations and reflects the U.S.\u2019 strategic intent to implement energy-related policies aimed at minimizing reliance on components associated with China.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury updated safe harbor tables this week, introducing new default component cost percentages to account for the premium customers will pay for U.S.-made wafers, aiming to incentivize domestic wafer manufacturing. The bonus is seen as a \u201cdirect complement\u201d to the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit. While the inclusion of wafers in the guidance is considered significant, industry players remain skeptical about its impact on procurement activities or wafer manufacturing plans in the U.S.\n\nOPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities.

But despite living less than 10 miles apart for most of their lives, it wasn\u2019t until 2017 when they realised how close they really are.\n\nThe pair had been friends for decades. (Steve TV/YouTube)\n\nWhile Robinson was adopted, MacFarlane never knew his father and his daughter, Cindy, really wanted to help him find out about him.\n\nSo, he used a DNA test to find out about his ancestry and found a match.\n\nAdvert\n\nTurns out, someone had identical X chromosomes with MacFarlane, a user named Robi737.\n\nCindy said on Steve TV there were \u2018over a thousand DNA matches\u2019 and when she sought out the highest match, it listed Robi737 as \u2018close family or sibling\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd my mum said to tell dad to call uncle Alan because he flew 737s as a pilot for Aloha Airlines and everyone called him Robbie as a nickname,\u201d she explained.\n\nBut yep, you guessed it, Robi737 was in fact the username of Robinson on the site.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cWhen we got the results back it was discovered that Alan wasn\u2019t only my best friend, he was my brother,\u201d he said.\n\nReally completing the saying, it turns out the pair do in fact share the same birth mother.\n\nThe pair told Sky News it had been an \u2018overwhelming experience\u2019 calling it the \u2018best Christmas present\u2019 at the time.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"I had a younger brother that I lost when he was 19, so I never had nieces or nephews. I thought I'll never know my birth mother, I'll never have any nieces or nephews,\u201d Robinson explained.\n\nAnd despite MacFarlane occasionally thinking they did look \u2018a little bit\u2019 alike, it never crossed either man\u2019s mind that they may be related.\n\nWhen they told their families, they told Steve TV there wasn\u2019t \u2018a dry eye in the whole place\u2019.\n\nWell, friends for 60 years but brothers for life it turns out.

            "article_content": "One of the key factors for the sustenance of eight billion people globally has been agriculture, and that sector, in turn, has been fuelled by fertilisers such as ammonia. However, due to high volumes, ammonia production contributes significantly to carbon emissions.\n\nBut this is likely to soon change.\n\nA new study published in scientific journal Joule has revealed a new ground-breaking method to produce ammonia under moderate subsurface conditions. Many believe this could impact the agriculture sector the world over and even reduce carbon emissions.\n\nAmmonia is a critical component of fertilisers and an emerging green fuel. For over a century it was produced by using Haber-Bosch process under high temperature and pressure.\n\nThe report claims ammonia can be produced in Earth\u2019s subsurface as it houses similar conditions, in turn offering a sustainable and energy-efficient alternative.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings have prompted the creation of Addis Energy, a company aiming to commercialise the process. Speaking to MIT Technology Review, Addis Energy\u2019s CEO Mark Bennett said, \u201cOur technology has the potential to address the dual challenges of food security and climate change by revolutionising ammonia production.\u201d\n\nAmmonia: Key to food systems and clean energy\n\nAmmonia is essential for modern agriculture, with most fertilisers relying on this compound to boost crop yields. However, the current Haber-Bosch process used to produce ammonia is highly energy-intensive, consuming 1-2% of global energy annually and emitting about 1.8% of global carbon dioxide. This dependence on fossil fuels has drawn widespread criticism as industries worldwide now face an increasing pressure to \u201cdecarbonise.\u201d\n\nThe discovery opens new possibilities for using naturally occurring chemical reactions to produce ammonia at lower energy inputs. The research team demonstrated that nitrogen and hydrogen react with specific minerals to form ammonia, mimicking subsurface geological processes.\n\nThe lead researcher, Dr Emily Rhodes, explained, \u201cThis method not only replicates natural processes but also provides an opportunity to dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of ammonia production.\u201d\n\nBroader applications and industry impact\n\nThe implications extend beyond agriculture. Ammonia is also emerging as a clean fuel for sectors like shipping, where its high energy density and zero carbon emissions make it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. This breakthrough could accelerate ammonia\u2019s adoption by addressing one of its major drawbacks: The emissions associated with its production.\n\nThe formation of Addis Energy highlights the growing focus on translating scientific discoveries into industrial applications. Bennett noted that the company aims to build pilot facilities to demonstrate the technology\u2019s scalability. \u201cOur priority is to ensure the process is not only environmentally sustainable but also economically competitive with existing methods,\u201d he said.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nWhile the technology shows promise, significant challenges remain. Scaling the process from the lab to commercial operations will require substantial investment and validation. Additionally, existing infrastructure tailored to the Haber-Bosch method may need significant adaptations to accommodate this new approach.\n\nExperts also point to the regulatory landscape as a key factor. Any new ammonia production technology must meet strict safety and environmental standards, particularly as the chemical has dual-use applications in agriculture and energy.\n\nA step towards sustainability\n\nThis discovery aligns with broader global efforts to reduce industrial emissions and transition to sustainable energy systems. If successful, Addis Energy\u2019s innovation could reshape two major industries \u2014 agriculture and shipping \u2014 while contributing to climate goals.\n\nDr Rhodes emphasised the potential impact: \u201cThis is a pivotal step toward transforming a vital yet carbon-intensive process into one that aligns with a sustainable future.\u201d\n\nThe next decade will determine whether this breakthrough can move from promise to practice, but its potential to drive change is undeniable."
