            "article_content": "Nothing to worry about?\n\nNot according to a growing number of lawmakers and local officials who are becoming increasingly alarmed about the number of drone sightings reported near sensitive locations in New Jersey.\n\nOne candidate for governor says it might be time to declare a state of emergency while two congressmen have called for the drones to be shot down. One of those congressmen says evidence suggests that the sophisticated drones are tied to a foreign adversary, although the Department of Defense officials said there was no truth to that.\n\nDrones tied to Iran?\n\nU.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J. 2nd District, said \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d ties \u201cdrones could be the work of foreign adversaries, specifically Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, we know that there are drones flying in from the direction of the ocean. We also know there is an Iranian drone mothership that is missing from port in Iran, with a timeline matching the emergence of these drones,\" Van Drew said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe time to act on this information is now before the threat escalates any further. These drones are intentionally flying in uncontrolled airspace, expertly navigating around areas with radar coverage,\u201d Van Drew said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Pentagon, however, shot down that theory, telling the Wall Street Journal that the drones were not tied to any foreign adversary.\n\nVan Drew said the drones should be shot down in order to assess the threat.\n\n\u201cWe should have already taken action by imposing flight restrictions to regain our control. Whether this is a foreign adversary or even just a group of drone hobbyists, we cannot allow unidentified drones to operate freely in our airspace with no consequences and it is time we eliminate the threat they pose and shoot them down.\u201d\n\nDrone over Ocean County Drone over Ocean County (Ocean County Sheriff's Office) loading...\n\nTime for a state of emergency?\n\nState Sen. Jon Bramnick, R-Union, a candidate for governor, said a state of emergency should be declared to \u201cshut down the airspace to drones and allow the Department of Defense to investigate.\n\nOn Tuesday, FBI Assistant Director of the Critical Incident Response Group Robert Wheeler testified in the House of Representatives that no evidence indicates the drones are threat, but added that \"we just don't know. And that's the concerning part.\"\n\nState homeland security officials met behind closed doors Wednesday morning with mayors from across the state.\n\nDrone over Mount Laurel 12/5/24 Drone over Mount Laurel 12/5/24 (Alette Knoblauch via Facebook) loading...\n\nWhat are people seeing? Army of drones\n\nPolice have been receiving reports about drones since Thanksgiving. The drones, some as large as cars, have been spotted near President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s properties, power lines, a reservoir, police stations and military installations.\n\nU.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., said he saw police footage that recorded more than 50 drones coming from the ocean, with more than a dozen trailing a Coast Guard vessel. Coast Guard officials said they did not know their origin.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy, who last week first acknowledged the reports, says they do not appear to be a threat. But those statements do little to allay fears because Murphy and federal officials have also said that they do not know who is operating the unmanned aircraft.\n\nMurphy said the drones go dark after they are spotted, hampering efforts at investigating them.\n\nSome reports have been false, with people mistaking planes or helicopters for drones.\n\nOn Tuesday, police in Parsippany-Troy Hills refuted rumors on the Ring app community claiming that a drone had downed power lines in a fiery crash. Instead, a car crash had toppled a utility pole."

            "article_content": "MIT Technology Review got to try out Astra in a closed-door live demo last week. It was a stunning experience, but there\u2019s a gulf between polished promo and live demo.\n\nAstra uses Gemini 2.0\u2019s built-in agent framework to answer questions and carry out tasks via text, speech, image, and video, calling up existing Google apps like Search, Maps, and Lens when it needs to. \u201cIt\u2019s merging together some of the most powerful information retrieval systems of our time,\u201d says Bibo Xu, product manager for Astra.\n\nGemini 2.0 and Astra are joined by Mariner, a new agent built on top of Gemini that can browse the web for you; Jules, a new Gemini-powered coding assistant; and Gemini for Games, an experimental assistant that you can chat to and ask for tips as you play video games.\n\n(And let\u2019s not forget that in the last week Google DeepMind also announced Veo, a new video generation model; Imagen 3, a new version of its image generation model; and Willow, a new kind of chip for quantum computers. Whew. Meanwhile, CEO Demis Hassabis was in Sweden yesterday receiving his Nobel Prize.)\n\nGoogle DeepMind claims that Gemini 2.0 is twice as fast as the previous version, Gemini 1.5, and outperforms it on a number of standard benchmarks, including MMLU-Pro, a large set of multiple-choice questions designed to test the abilities of large language models across a range of subjects, from math and physics to health, psychology, and philosophy.\n\nBut the margins between top-end models like Gemini 2.0 and those from rival labs like OpenAI and Anthropic are now slim. These days, advances in large language models are less about how good they are and more about what you can do with them.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where agents come in.\n\nHands on with Project Astra\n\nLast week I was taken through an unmarked door on an upper floor of a building in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross district into a room with strong secret-project vibes. The word \u201cASTRA\u201d was emblazoned in giant letters across one wall. Xu\u2019s dog, Charlie, the project\u2019s de facto mascot, roamed between desks where researchers and engineers were busy building a product that Google is betting its future on."

            "article_content": "In the face of piling controversy \u2014 and a second lawsuit concerning the welfare of children \u2014 Google has taken pains to downplay its relationship to the embattled AI chatbot startup Character.AI.\n\nAbout this time last year, though? Google was crowning Character.AI as Google Play's first-ever \"Best with AI\" app of the year.\n\n\"AI made a major splash in 2023 allowing people to harness the technology to build knowledge, improve expression, and much, much more,\" reads a Google post lauding the app. \"Enter Character.AI, an innovative new app that brings unique AI-powered characters to you, each with their own distinct personalities and perspectives.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A world of characters is now at your fingertips,\" the post adds. (OpenAI's ChatGPT is listed as the category's honorable mention.)\n\nEarlier today, two Texas families filed a lawsuit accusing the Character.AI platform of engaging in emotional and sexual abuse of their minor children, resulting in self-harm and physical violence. The complaint is the second in recent weeks concerning the welfare of child users of Character.AI \u2014 the first, filed in October in the state of Florida, argues that a 14-year-old's death by suicide was caused by his interactions with Character.AI \u2014 and argues that these disturbing incidents are the result of intentional design choices inherent to the platform's function.\n\nAccording to the suit, Character.AI and its cofounders, Noam Shazeer and Daniel de Freitas, aren't the only parties at fault. It also targets Google, a significant financial backer of Character.AI and the provider of its AI computing infrastructure, alleging that the tech giant knew about the Character.AI platform's dangers and facilitated its operations anyway in a ploy to farm valuable troves of user data without accountability.\n\nIn a statement to Futurism, Google rejected the lawsuit's characterization of its relationship with Character.AI, claiming that \"Google and Character.AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies, nor have we used them in our products.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"User safety is a top concern for us, which is why we've taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes,\" the company added.\n\nWhether Google intentionally used Character.AI as an unofficial AI testing facility remains to be proven in court.\n\nBut the two parties do clearly have deep ties: Shazeer and de Freitas, in fact, founded Character.AI in 2021 after departing Google over frustrations with corporate red tape. The Character.AI platform would make its way into consumers' hands in the fall of 2022, shortly before the AI race kicked off with the public release of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAnd in the heat of that industry-wide AI race \u2014 which caught Google on its back foot, as the New York Times reported at the time \u2014 Character.AI and Google seemingly held onto their close association. In May of 2023, for instance, Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian bragged onstage at a developer conference that Google was providing Character.AI with the pricey computing infrastructure needed to power its AI platform.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We provide Character with the world's most performant and cost-efficient infrastructure for training and serving the models,\" said Kurian at the time, calling Character.AI a \"partner.\" \"By combining its own AI capabilities with those of Google Cloud, consumers can create their own deeply personalized characters and interact with them.\"\n\nLater year, in early November, Reuters reported that Google was weighing a high-dollar investment into Character.AI. By the end of that same month, the platform had been crowned Google Play's first-ever \"Best with AI\" app.\n\n\"We've been increasingly impressed by what AI can do,\" Google added in its announcement of the award, \"and we know you'll be impressed, too.\"\n\nGoogle's interest in Character.AI continued into August of 2024, when the search behemoth agreed to pay Character.AI $2.7 billion for access to its AI model in the form of a one-time licensing fee. As part of that deal, Shazeer and de Freitas rejoined Google's AI division and took 30 other Character.AI employees with them, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiple Futurism reviews of Character.AI have revealed droves of alarming AI characters hosted by the platform, including chatbots explicitly dedicated to themes of suicide, pedophilia, pro-eating disorder content, and self-harm roleplay.\n\nThese disturbing chatbots were easy to find, accessible to Character.AI accounts listed as belonging to minors, and available for users to interact with well beyond Google's most recent August investment into the AI company \u2014 and, to that end, well after the platform's \"Best with AI\" crowning.\n\nCharacter.AI, for its part, has since removed a note about the Google Play award from its \"About\" page.\n\nMore on Character.AI and Google: Google-Backed AI Startup Tested Dangerous Chatbots on Children, Lawsuit Alleges"

            "article_content": "Dandadan is the latest anime to make waves in the West, yet everyone who\u2019s tuned in to watch it agrees that one episode stands head and shoulders above the rest.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never watched the show (why are you reading this?), allow me to explain the premise briefly. Two high schoolers, Momo Ayase and Okarun, become unlikely friends after discovering that ghosts and aliens are real, and they team up to keep the world safe from paranormal threats.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nExcept that\u2019s only half the story. The real driving force in Dandadan is Okarun\u2019s quest to get his testicles back, which were stolen from him by the Yokai Turbo Granny. Yes, you read that right, Dandadan spends a lot of time focused on a teen boy\u2019s nutsack.\n\nAs you can probably imagine then, this is a show that doesn\u2019t take itself very seriously, and as you\u2019d expect, it\u2019s very funny and full of action. It\u2019s classic shonen stuff, really. Yet every now and again, Dandadan will blindside you with an episode that\u2019s so heartbreaking you\u2019ll be left an emotional wreck by the time it ends.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nAcrobatic Silky\n\nCrunchyroll\n\nIn fact, one episode in particular is so good that fans have already labeled it the best in the series. I\u2019m talking, of course, about Episode 7, titled \u2018To A Kinder World\u2019. This genuinely harrowing chapter sees Momo and Okarun battle the terrifying Acrobatic Silky, a powerful Yokai with designs on their school friend, Aira Shiratori.\n\nYet the episode takes a tragic turn when, during the battle, Aira dies, and Acrobatic Silky decides to sacrifice her own aura to the teenager to save her life. During the transfer, the audience gets to see a flashback to Acrobatic Silky\u2019s human life and what drove her to become a vengeful spirit in the afterlife.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nSilky, it turns out, was a poor single mom struggling to keep her head above water. To provide for her daughter, she turned to prostitution and loan sharks, which allowed her to give her child a happy life. One day, however, rather than paying the loan sharks back, she bought her daughter a pretty dress, and let\u2019s just say the criminals who lent her the money weren\u2019t pleased with her.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIn one of the most triggering scenes I\u2019ve ever watched, the loan sharks beat Silky half to death and kidnap her daughter. Silky gave chase, but she was so grievously wounded that she died (or took her own life, it\u2019s a bit unclear), never finding out what happened to her beloved little girl.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nFor years, she wandered Tokyo as a ghost until a fateful encounter with Aira transformed her into the fearsome Yokai we know and love.\n\nMummy?\n\nCrunchyroll\n\nAs the transfer finishes, Silky starts to break apart, dying once again. This time, however, there will be no afterlife; if a ghost dies without completing its unfinished business, it simply ceases to be. However, before Silky goes into the void, Aira steps up and hugs the Yokai, thanking her and calling her mommy.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nThis brief act of kindness convinces Silky she is a good mother after all, and it counts as her completing her unfinished business so she can go to a kinder world. It\u2019s heart-wrenching stuff and on a level with some of the saddest scenes ever seen on TV.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising then that fans love it, and a quick search of Episode 7 will bring up countless posts and comments lauding the episode for its gorgeous animation, beautiful storytelling, and heart-rending final moments.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nThis isn\u2019t just Redditor group think either; on IMDb, it\u2019s Dandadan\u2019s highest-rated episode with a score of 9.7, the same score as all-time classics like The Soprano\u2019s \u2018Pine Barrens\u2019 and \u2018The One Where Everyone Finds Out\u2019 from Friends.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not checked out Dandadan, maybe do yourself a favor and just get up to Episode 7 \u2013 you won\u2019t be disappointed.

Pricing and availability subject to change.\n\nDemolition of Bobby Mackey's Music World, often dubbed America's most haunted nightclub, began Tuesday morning.\n\nAfter nearly 50 years of live music from owner and country singer Bobby Mackey, as well as national attention from shows that include \"Ghost Hunters\" and \"Ghost Adventures,\" the Wilder, Kentucky, venue is being torn down. Mackey and his wife, Denise, have plans to rebuild a new, one-story bar on the land by 2026, The Enquirer previously reported. But that date is subject to change.\n\n\"It's mixed emotion for sure, but I've been so embarrassed by the old building for so long,\" Mackey, who opened the venue in 1978, told The Enquirer in March. \"It's going to be bittersweet because it's been great for almost 46 years we've been there. But it's just one of those things that \u2013 time moves on.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the meantime, Bobby Mackey's has temporarily relocated to the former location of Mugbees Biker Bar and Restaurant in Florence at 8405 US Highway 42.\n\nThe venue's beloved mechanical bull, country music memorabilia, Bobby Mackey's stage costumes, a 2004 Ford Thunderbird, items related to the venue's paranormal folklore and more were sold in a public auction over the summer.\n\nHistory of Bobby Mackey's Music World\n\nThe grounds Bobby Mackey's has called home used to be the site of a 19th-century slaughterhouse, which was later torn down. In the 1930s, entrepreneur Buck Brady opened a nightclub on the land called the Primrose Club, which was supposedly taken over and run by the mob.\n\nThe nightclub was renamed the Latin Quarter and eventually shut down in the 1950s before reopening as the Hard Rock. After the Hard Rock closed in the 1970s, country singer and Kentucky native Bobby Mackey opened Bobby Mackey's Music World in 1978.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMackey told The Enquirer he knew the folklore surrounding the location but never paid any attention to the haunted rumors until he met Carl Lawson, an 18-year-old who lived up the street. Lawson was hired to be the establishment's caretaker.\n\nBobby Mackey's Music World on Sunday, Sept. 25, 2022. Toys and trinkets were left for the alleged ghosts that lurked in the \"room of faces.\" People have claimed to feel childlike spirits present in the room, but there is no real history of children being in or around the club.\n\nWhile tending to the property, Lawson, who lived above the nightclub until his death in 2012, started having paranormal experiences.\n\nHe is believed to have dug up the journal of a pregnant singer named Joanna, who allegedly killed herself via poison after her father murdered her lover and hung him in the dressing room. Lawson even participated in an exorcism performed by the \"Ghost Adventures\" crew, which was featured in the 2009 book \"Exorcism of Carl Lawson\" by Douglas Hensley.\n\nOver the years, the nightclub cultivated a fan base invested in both Mackey as a local country music legend and the ghost sightings that allegedly took place at his establishment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Look: Bobby Mackey's historic Kentucky nightclub gets demolished"

From the IAEA\u2019s unique laboratories, our scientists are using radiation to recycle plastics and create plants that can better withstand climate change, they\u2019re researching new targeted forms of cancer therapy, and much more. In the last couple of years alone, the IAEA sent seeds into space to see if we can develop even stronger variants; we sent scientists to Antarctica to collect accurate data about plastic pollution and we helped conservationists use radiotracers to combat rhino poaching!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are so many fascinating stories to tell about the cutting-edge nuclear techniques through which the IAEA assists countries in the fight against hunger, disease, climate change and energy poverty, to name just a few, and we are very happy to be telling them together with the Discovery Channel.\u201d\n\nIAEA Director of Communications Sophie Boutaud de la Combe added: \u201cWe are very proud of the films we make at the IAEA, where we have built a dedicated video team with award winning cinematographers and are delighted that the Discovery Channel will use our original footage to reach an even bigger audience.

            "article_content": "Harvard University announced Thursday it\u2019s releasing a high-quality dataset of nearly one million public-domain books that could be used by anyone to train large language models and other AI tools. The dataset was created by Harvard\u2019s newly formed Institutional Data Initiative with funding from both Microsoft and OpenAI. It contains books scanned as part of the Google Books project that are no longer protected by copyright.\n\nAround five times the size of the notorious Books3 dataset that was used to train AI models like Meta\u2019s Llama, the Institutional Data Initiative's database spans genres, decades, and languages, with classics from Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, and Dante included alongside obscure Czech math textbooks and Welsh pocket dictionaries. Greg Leppert, executive director of the Institutional Data Initiative, says the project is an attempt to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d by giving the general public, including small players in the AI industry and individual researchers, access to the sort of highly-refined and curated content repositories that normally only established tech giants have the resources to assemble. \u201cIt's gone through rigorous review,\u201d he says.\n\nLeppert believes the new public domain database could be used in conjunction with other licensed materials to build artificial intelligence models. \u201cI think about it a bit like the way that Linux has become a foundational operating system for so much of the world,\u201d he says, noting that companies would still need to use additional training data to differentiate their models from those of their competitors.\n\nBurton Davis, Microsoft\u2019s vice president and deputy general counsel for intellectual property, emphasized that the company\u2019s support for the project was in line with its broader beliefs about the value of creating \u201cpools of accessible data\u201d for AI startups to use that are \u201cmanaged in the public\u2019s interest.\u201d In other words, Microsoft isn\u2019t necessarily planning to swap out all of the AI training data it has used in its own models with public domain alternatives like the books in the new Harvard database. \u201cWe use publicly available data for the purposes of training our models,\u201d Davis says.\n\nAs dozens of lawsuits filed over the use of copyrighted data for training AI wind their way through the courts, the future of how artificial intelligence tools are built hangs in the balance. If AI companies win their cases, they\u2019ll be able to keep scraping the internet without needing to enter into licensing agreements with copyright holders. But if they lose, AI companies could be forced to overhaul how their models get made. A wave of projects like the Harvard database are plowing forward under the assumption that\u2014no matter what happens\u2014there will be an appetite for public domain datasets.\n\nIn addition to the trove of books, the Institutional Data Initiative is also working with the Boston Public Library to scan millions of articles from different newspapers now in the public domain, and it says it\u2019s open to forming similar collaborations down the line. The exact way the books dataset will be released is not settled. The Institutional Data Initiative has asked Google to work together on public distribution, but the search giant hasn\u2019t publicly agreed to host it yet, though Harvard says it\u2019s optimistic it will. (Google did not respond to WIRED\u2019s requests for comment.)"

            "article_content": "Appian research reveals that data challenges remain in spite of digital initiatives, impacting efficiency, reporting, customer service, and compliance\n\nSYDNEY, Dec. 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ \u2014 According to new research from Appian ( Nasdaq: APPN ) , Australian energy companies face data accessibility challenges. 78% of them have adopted new digital tools in the past five years but data silos remain a challenge.\n\nAs energy prices continue to soar across Australia, scrutiny from consumers, government and businesses has also intensified. Data accessibility shortcomings mean many energy companies struggle to make informed business decisions and meet escalating industry and customer service demands.\n\nThe report, Appian Asia-Pacific Data Trends Survey 2024: Opportunities and impediments for data-driven enterprise growth , which surveyed over 300 professionals across the energy, utilities and oil and gas sectors, shows that nearly half (49%) of respondents cited data accessibility as a major challenge. More than 76% of respondents also indicated that they have had to work with incomplete or inaccessible data.\n\n\u201cEnergy companies are under more pressure than ever before to streamline operations and respond quickly to market changes and demands,\u201d said Luke Thomas, Area Vice President of Asia-Pacific and Japan at Appian. \u201cThis is driven by heightened scrutiny over recent energy price spikes, alongside efforts to support Australia\u2019s goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030 and reaching net zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\u201cOur research results show that digital adoption alone is not enough. Without a unified approach to data management, organisations risk not realising the full value of their digital investments and not keeping up with market demands,\u201d Thomas warned.\n\nThe problem: data silos\n\nThe survey found that 42% of respondents pointed to data silos as a primary concern. Data often remains in different systems as energy companies grow and acquire new applications. Data locked away in lots of different systems is hard to access and use, posing a major problem for workers.\n\n\u201cFor Australian energy companies, the biggest cited problem is that organisational information is inaccessible because it\u2019s regularly stored in different systems and in different formats,\u201d explained Ray Croxon, Area Vice President of Solutions Consulting at Appian. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much being able to have the data but having it in a format that\u2019s easy to consume.\u201d\n\nThomas also raised concern around data silos: \u201cToday, energy companies in Australia heavily rely on digital processes and accurate data to function. Yet due to data silos, their workers operate with incomplete or inadequate information to manage complex and critical operations.\u201d\n\nThe business impact\n\nThe research underscores how data issues are directly affecting critical business areas:\n\nOperational efficiency. 55% of businesses said data issues caused operational inefficiencies. Poor data management leads to wasted resources, duplicated efforts, and slow response times, creating a ripple effect across the organisation\u2019s core functions.\n\n55% of businesses said data issues caused operational inefficiencies.

Customer service. 34% of respondents cited customer service as a major issue. \u201cFragmented or inaccurate data can lead to poor customer experiences. This can manifest as delays in resolving customer enquiries, incorrect billing, or misaligned service offerings,\u201d said Croxon.\n\n34% of respondents cited customer service as a major issue. \u201cFragmented or inaccurate data can lead to poor customer experiences.

Reporting and analysis. 56% of businesses struggle to derive insights from their data for reporting and analysis. Without a reliable single source of truth, energy companies cannot accurately conduct predictive analytics, operational forecasting, and strategic planning. These are areas where even small errors can lead to significant financial and operational repercussions.\n\n56% of businesses struggle to derive insights from their data for reporting and analysis. Without a reliable single source of truth, energy companies cannot accurately conduct predictive analytics, operational forecasting, and strategic planning. These are areas where even small errors can lead to significant financial and operational repercussions. Compliance and auditing. 31% of energy companies said fragmented data impacted compliance and auditing. \u201cIn an industry where regulatory scrutiny is intensifying, the inability to maintain a transparent, auditable data trail poses serious risks. Companies may face challenges responding to regulatory requests, leading to delays in filings, fines, or even non-compliance penalties,\u201d said Thomas.\n\nThe end of data silos: Appian\u2019s solution to data challenges\n\nTo address data challenges, Appian advocates strategically implementing a modern process automation platform with a data fabric. Platforms with data fabric give decision makers a complete picture of their enterprise in real time, at scale.\n\n\u201c A data fabric is an architectural layer and toolkit that seamlessly integrates data across disparate systems, whether on-premises or in the cloud. By creating a centralised, unified view, a data fabric helps \u2026 these companies leverage their digital investments for meaningful business outcomes,\u201d concluded Thomas.\n\nAppian\u2019s data fabric unifies, secures, and optimizes enterprise data. It lets organizations use their data to build impactful and data-rich digital solutions combined with automation, AI, and low-code design. It works by connecting and unifying data across enterprise systems in an integrated data layer. And because of Appian\u2019s low-code controls and auto-optimized performance, data fabric reduces the burden of integration and data management, so you can democratize data access and make smarter decisions faster.\n\nDownload the Appian Asia-Pacific Data Trends report to see how energy and utilities companies are transforming their data with automation.\n\nAbout Appian\n\nAppian is a software company that orchestrates business processes.

            "article_content": "Scientists have accidentally discovered a particle that has mass when it\u2019s traveling in one direction, but no mass while traveling in a different direction. Known as semi-Dirac fermions, particles with this bizarre behavior were first predicted 16 years ago.\n\nThe discovery was made in a semi-metal material called ZrSiS, made up of zirconium, silicon and sulfur, while studying the properties of quasiparticles. These emerge from the collective behavior of many particles within a solid material.\n\n\u201cThis was totally unexpected,\u201d said Yinming Shao, lead author on the study. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even looking for a semi-Dirac fermion when we started working with this material, but we were seeing signatures we didn\u2019t understand \u2013 and it turns out we had made the first observation of these wild quasiparticles that sometimes move like they have mass and sometimes move like they have none.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like an impossible feat \u2013 how can something gain and lose mass readily? But it actually comes back to that classic formula that everyone\u2019s heard of but many might not understand \u2013 E = mc2. This describes the relationship between a particle\u2019s energy (E) and mass (m), with the speed of light (c) squared.\n\nAccording to Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, nothing that has any mass can reach the speed of light, because it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate it to that speed. But a funny thing happens when you flip that on its head \u2013 if a massless particle slows down from the speed of light, it actually gains mass.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. When the quasiparticles travel along one dimension inside the ZrSiS crystals, they do so at the speed of light and are therefore massless. But as soon as they try to travel in a different direction, they hit resistance, slow down and gain mass.\n\n\u201cImagine the particle is a tiny train confined to a network of tracks, which are the material\u2019s underlying electronic structure,\u201d said Shao. \u201cNow, at certain points the tracks intersect, so our particle train is moving along its fast track, at light speed, but then it hits an intersection and needs to switch to a perpendicular track. Suddenly, it experiences resistance, it has mass. The particles are either all energy or have mass depending on the direction of their movement along the material\u2019s \u2018tracks.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe researchers originally set out to study the quantum interactions in the material by watching how the electrons in it responded to light. They found that the energy level of the electrons followed an unexpected pattern as the strength of the magnetic field increases, which turned out to be a key prediction of semi-Dirac fermions.\n\nWhile it\u2019s pretty high-concept physics, the team says the discovery could eventually open up a range of applications for ZrSiS similar to that of graphene.\n\n\u201cIt is a layered material, which means once we can figure out how to have a single layer cut of this compound, we can harness the power of semi-Dirac fermions, control its properties with the same precision as graphene,\u201d said Shao. \u201cBut the most thrilling part of this experiment is that the data cannot be fully explained yet. There are many unsolved mysteries in what we observed, so that is what we are working to understand.\u201d\n\nThe research was published in the journal Physical Review X.\n\nSource: Penn State"

            "article_content": "00:00\n\nHi everybody, welcome to DEMO, the show where companies come in and they show us their latest products and platforms. Today, I'm joined by Neil Miller, he is the Director of Product Marketing at Kissflow. Welcome to the show, Neil. So tell us a little bit about what Kissflow is, and then what are you going to show us here today?\n\n\n\n00:14\n\nSo Kissflow is a no-code, low-code, application platform that really spreads the power of application development across the enterprise.\n\n\n\n00:21\n\nGenerally, who is this designed for? Is it designed for product developers, or is it other people within the company that might not be a developer?\n\n\n\n00:30\n\nYes, so Kissflow is a unique product in that it's really built for both groups, so it can handle the people that like the high-powered, low-code developers who really want to build a lot of things out -- they don't need a lot of certifications or anything. It's a platform they can get on to build things very quickly and easily. But then the other side, you also have junior developers, business analysts and specifically process owners, who want to build their own thing themselves. The platform is easy enough for them to use that they can build their own applications too.\n\n\n\n00:56\n\nDo you subscribe to the whole citizen developer movement that we're seeing in the space, because of skill shortages and things like that?\n\n\n\n01:04\n\nAbsolutely. Citizen development is one of the main themes we like to play into. Now our platform is very governed, so IT admins have the ability to govern the entire platform and know what's going on in there. But at the same time, we believe that people who actually run these processes probably know best what's there. So as long as you give them the right tools, and you give them enough training, they're able to build what they need.\n\n\n\n01:25\n\nBecause I guess if I was in IT, the biggest fear would be like, \u201cWait, you're we're giving power to who?\u201d Because the last thing you want is me programming something, with very little design or development skills. So why should companies care about Kissflow versus maybe some of the other platforms out there, or some of the other processes that go on.\n\n\n\n01:42\n\nLike I said, Kissflow\u2019s unique thing is that one, it\u2019s just super easy to use. You're going to see it in the demo here a second. The layout, the feel of it, is just really geared towards someone who knows what they want but maybe doesn't have the development skills about it. There's a lot of things we won't show today that show the power of the low-code side of it as well, so that even a higher-powered developer can come in and really do what they want to do, but that's one thing that really makes it easy, is just the ease of use and be able to generate things quickly. So even somebody who's in the IT department that just wants to build a lot of apps very quickly to get things out of their backlog, they can really easily build dozens of apps on this.\n\n\n\n02:16\n\nIf companies didn't have this, would they just be relying on developers to do a lot of the requests that are coming in? Does this offload some of those processes to people that usually don't have those skills?\n\n\n\n02:26\n\nSo a few different things. One is that they would either just be custom developing things. Second is they might be using a different low-code platform, but typically, you're only going to be building two or three applications a year on those really big platforms that are out there. Kissflow is more like, \u201cHey, give us a few dozen that we're going to get done in a year.\u201d Then the citizen developers, the other thing they would be using would just be spreadsheets, Excel or something like that, to build what they need. So this is their option to actually get something that's an improvement on Excel.\n\n\n\n02:53\n\nSo let's go into the demo. Tell us what you're going to show us.\n\n\n\n03:00\n\nWhat you see here is the basics of a process. So we have a few different modules in Kissflow, but the process builder is one of the easiest to understand, and the one that generates the most interest for most people. So we start off with a form, which is a little bit interesting. Most people are going to say, OK, build us a data table or something like that. But we actually want to start with a form, because that's where the process owner is usually going to start. They know what they want to do. In this situation, we're looking at asset disposal requests. So this is, again, something maybe your admin team is going to use, or maybe somebody else in the IT department is going to use, but it's really something that the person who is building this knows what they need, and they just want to be able to bring that in.\n\n\n\nSo the form is very, very simple. It's all drag and drop. We have tons of form fields that are available here on the left, all sorts of things, from very simple things to very complicated. We also have some AI features here. So if you want to, just based on the name asset disposal request, you're going to be able to generate types of fields you might need to know. So if somebody's building it for the first time, they're going to be able to bring those in. They can do anything here, building out sections, you're also able to refer back to fields. We have remote lookup, so you can go to databases outside of Kissflow and bring those things in. Every field has the ability to change the settings, to add validations, add visibility requirements, stylize it the way you want, and even add these custom events, which is more the low-code part of what's going on. So the field, the form is one of the things that is most fun to use, I feel like to build in, but then you want to take that form and drive it through a workflow. So that's where we go to the second phase. So here again, this is one of the powers of Kissflow, is just being able to see how simple it is to build things out. Again, we have these AI features where they will suggest steps for you based on the name of the platform. Here I have a few that are already added in. It's as easy as adding in new steps. Adding in you can do something like a parallel branch where two different things may be happening at the same time. Or you want to create conditions based on how things happen. So all these things are available to just make it easy.\n\n\n\nOne of the best things about it is how you assign things. A lot of these features, a lot of other platforms, don't have so easily to do in terms of if you're going to assign it to a group of people, if you're going to assign it to everyone, if everyone needs to approve it before it goes forward, if only a few people need to approve it. If you want to assign things to one person based on the region that they're in, but a different region needs to go to somebody else, that's really easy to do in Kissflow. If you're trying to hand-code a lot of the things, it becomes very difficult to do. You can also build in these conditions. You can look at different SLAs, actions, deadlines, field permissions that are available at different steps. That's really one of the great, but I'm able to create services requests. I'm able to create product marketing requests based on these workflows and just set up the way I want to do it.\n\n\n\n05:46\n\nDo you find that when you're doing the application itself, does it get sent to approval from the IT department to make sure that you're not missing anything? Or does another developer check your work before it gets deployed? Or because, if it's internal, maybe you don't have to do that?\n\n\n\n06:02\n\nSo within the citizen development framework, which we also try to align ourselves a lot, you kind of have these zonings of applications, they're based on the risk and based on the complexity. So a lot of risk that's involved and a lot of complexity, you really want your IT team to be hands-on doing those things. Maybe you're going to let a citizen developer work on a form or something like that. Then you have things that are less risk, but maybe with a little bit of complexity. That's where someone just needs a mentor to be able to come along and make sure, \u201cHey, you did it right, you didn't screw up anything.\u201d Then you have this other area where it's like, it's low risk, it's low complexity, and pretty much you're just letting those people just build whatever they want, because they're not going to mess up too much.\n\n\n\nSo this particular one, asset disposal, there may be some concerns about some risks that are around there, but not too much. This would be an example of one that would probably be fine for a citizen developer just to build on their own, and just for the data governance platform, just to know that it\u2019s there. But other apps you're going to want to have people more involved in it.\n\n\n\nAfter you build out all the steps that you want, and again, this can get as complex as you want. We've seen many very big workflows that go on, then you go on to permissions. So here, at each step in the process, you're able to figure out if fields should be editable, if they're read-only, or if they're hidden. You can set these rules across steps or just for individual ones. It's really just a way to make sure to ensure some privacy issues, or ensure some scalability issues, as you're building these out to make sure that each step is what it needs to be.\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite features within this particular function in Kissflow is the simulate button. So here, instead of having to go live with something and then test it out and figure it out, this is really a way to just test it on the back end really quickly. Here I can simulate it as myself, or as lots of other people, and see what it would be like. I can see, these fields are obviously like a read-only field, but this one is something that I can use. And if I say, \u201cOkay, well, I didn't want that to be like that,\u201d I can just go back into the process and figure that out.\n\n\n\nWith each step I can see things. I can mark it, and I can submit it as done, and see what it looks like in the next section. You can also see what it looks like on a mobile app. So this is really the fun side of Kissflow, I would say, in order to be able to see what's going on and be able to build it. In this particular process builder, deploying an app is just as simple as clicking this button to go live. Now it's live. So now at this point, this is more like the runtime. So in here, a new person would be able to get in. They're going to click this New Item button. They're going to see all the same fields that you had with Kissflow, with our process builder. You're going to see exactly when something was started, when the next step was done. So these are going to have times if they had SLAs attached to them. The SLA is going to be there to know if it was handled appropriately or not. You can also add comments for people that are involved in the workflow. So if there's some extra things that need to be added into all these things, so you get this big data trail as well. So a lot of this use of Kissflow, with an approval management cycle, you're going to be able to get all the things you need, as opposed to just trying to handle something on either a simple workflow builder, on Excel or something.\n\n\n\n09:01\n\nYou were talking to me before the show that you've got some integrations that you wanted to show off?\n\n\n\n09:06\n\nSo this part of Kissflow is about approvals. So you're talking about mostly human-based ones, but also you can build a lot of really intense integrations as well. So here, this is an integration we built for another process was about scheduling interviews with customers. This is pretty easy, and again, you're going to see a similar workflow builder here, but here we're not talking about human elements. Now we don't have approvers. Now we are just going into different systems. So here, when a status of an item is updated, we're going to make sure certain data sets match and then send an email. Those are easy to do, but again, you can see lots of different connections we have here, lots of things within Kissflow. But then also outside of Kissflow, as well, other tools that if you want to go into one of your CMS or your ERP system and make a connection, those are very easy to do. Again, this is still no code. We're still talking about people like you and me that aren't technically minded, that can just go in and make what they need to do. Maybe I get into a little bit of trouble. I need to ask somebody, Hey, what I do here, and that's very easy, just to go and then you feel really empowered as a system developer.\n\n\n\n10:05\n\nYou've got a lot of features other than the stuff that you just showed me. But do you offer a free trial? Is it? Or how do you get set up on this?\n\n\n\n10:12\n\nYeah, free trials are available. As long as you go to our website, request a meeting with our sales team, they'll kind of get a figure for how you want to use it. One of our big things is that we like to see companies with a long list of backlogged apps. If you have five to 25 apps that you're like, \u201cMan, I wish somebody would take these off our plate,\u201d that's our kind of customer. So if you're in that that zone and you really want to see it, or you want to try out citizen development as well, unleashing something for the rest of the organization, then come in, we'll figure out if it's right for you, and make sure you get set up.\n\n\n\n10:43\n\nAnd it looks simple to operate, so I'm also assuming it's going to be simple to install. You're not talking like a three-month long install process.\n\n\n\n10:49\n\nAbsolutely not. We like to see people get up and going as soon as possible. We don't have any long certification courses. You get in, you learn the platform, and then again, depending on if you want to turn this over to people, citizen developers, or IT departments. IT departments are going to be very fast with this, and like, within a week, they're going to be up and building MVPs, and things much more complicated. What I was showing you before was our standard runtime that you can see with a certain process, but we have a page builder, you can build a custom UI, so you can have everything unique. You can build your own dashboards or your own reports. This is just like one small, easy part of Kissflow, but it can really be very powerful.\n\n\n\n11:27\n\nAll right, give me the website again.\n\n\n\n11:29\n\nKissflow.com.\n\n\n\n11:30\n\nNeil Miller, thanks again for joining us on the show.

It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first time I thought about leaving the US was in mid-2020. I was frustrated with how the pandemic was handled and was looking for a reason to leave the country.\n\nI was born in New York and grew up around the East Coast. I attended college in North Carolina, where I studied math and economics, but dropped out in my third year in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround the time, I became interested in Silicon Valley \u2014 it felt like a meritocratic place where people could take their own path. After leaving college, I worked as a baseball analyst and traveled between Seattle and San Francisco.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, I dropped plans to move to San Francisco. I thought the city was declining, and I preferred my lifestyle in Seattle. I was working for a startup with two Indian cofounders. When they decided to pursue the business full time, they faced visa challenges and had to move back to India. So, in 2021, I tagged along to visit India for the first time, traveling to Mumbai and Bengaluru.\n\nOn that trip, I met my wife, an American teacher in India. I also stumbled upon the idea for what would eventually become Commenda \u2014 the company I cofounded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI came up with the idea for my company in India\n\nI was talking to local founders in Mumbai who faced challenges registering or expanding their businesses in other countries. There are hundreds of multilateral trade agreements between countries and thousands of bilateral trade agreements, and no tool for businesses to navigate them.\n\nRelated stories\n\nI returned to the US about a month later and pitched a friend and investor at an early-stage venture-capital firm my idea: a platform that would become a one-stop compliance solution for companies looking to expand overseas.\n\nI didn't have a concrete product, but they liked the idea and wanted to invest $100,000. The investors asked me to go back to India and figure things out. It seemed like a great opportunity. I convinced my cofounder to leave his job at Google, and we both went to Bengaluru without an explicit plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing my own boss was tough in some ways, but I liked being able to do things on my own without the pressure of having a manager. I've been fired from jobs twice, and starting my own company was almost relieving.\n\nIn early 2022, we began building our company in India and wanted to provide solutions to both Indian and overseas businesses. We picked Bengaluru because it's where a lot of startups and multinalitional companies are that could use our service.\n\nWe developed enterprise software so that users could answer questions they had about local tax laws and ensure they incorporated and stayed compliant in any country they wanted to expand to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBengaluru is similar to Silicon Valley in some ways\n\nBengaluru felt like Silicon Valley in many ways. It's listed as a sister city of Silicon Valley at a train station in San Francisco.\n\nDuring my first visit, driving through south Bengaluru reminded me of Palo Alto, and talking to people confirmed it. The city is a tech and business hub with many small businesses and startups, so it gave us access to customers.\n\nThe city has an amazing pool of talent and is home to really open and collaborative founders. There are some great startup advisors and angel investors driving the ecosystem forward here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing in Bengaluru means we learn from local startups. There are cultural differences between the startup markets in the US and India. I've had to learn things about India and unlearn aspects of how business is done in the US.\n\nOne difference was that India is a less trusting ecosystem \u2014 we have had investors ask questions after agreeing to invest and completing diligence processes, even for a small check size.\n\nSometimes I wish the ecosystem was moving more quickly away from venture-capital funds operating more like private equity. But the new generation of fund managers is really promising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSplitting my time between Bengaluru and San Francisco\n\nSince we launched the company in 2022, we have faced some hiccups with immigration, but registering and operating in India has never been much of an issue.\n\nI had an e-business visa to work in India. The visa office struggled to coordinate with India's Ministry of Corporate Affairs to ensure I was cleared to open a business in the country, which dragged the process out by a few months.\n\nI wish the roads were better, and the traffic makes it hard to get around. I have also been rejected from renting an apartment because the landlord didn't like that I was a college dropout. Getting a permanent phone number was challenging, too, but knowing other foreigners had been through some of our problems made it easier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe year-round moderate weather and air quality are perks. I love how hospitable the people of India are. It's one of the most fun countries I have lived in because there are tons of festivals and parades. My wife and I enjoy traveling, and we can stay in nice hotels because they are more affordable in India. We are also close to Southeast Asia, which would have been very expensive to travel from California.\n\nI have apartments in San Francisco and Bengaluru and spend about half my time in each place. My wife and I bought our San Francisco apartment this summer, but I have not had an official residence in the US since 2021. About one-third of our team is in Silicon Valley, while the rest are in Bengaluru. Since we launched in 2022, we now have 250 customers in around 30 countries.\n\nI know other foreigners who have also moved to India to launch businesses. My sense is that moving to India is going to become more of a trend. I don't know if you're going to see a Little America in Bengaluru anytime soon, but there are just so many appealing things about it, such as the talent density and the generosity of the locals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs more Americans consider leaving the \"college to cubicle\" paradigm, moving to a foreign country to work for a business or start a business will become more appealing."

            "article_content": "CD Projekt Red dropped a new update for Cyberpunk 2077 that added customization options for your cars and character, photo mode features, and a few \u201csurprises\u201d the team is hoping fans will find themselves. One thing the team didn\u2019t mention in its live stream or patch notes was that update 2.2 would also bring a quest based on Balatro, 2024\u2019s card game indie darling that is nominated for Game of the Year at this year\u2019s Game Awards. If you haven\u2019t booted up Cyberpunk since the update but are curious about how to see this unexpected crossover, we\u2019ve got the rundown on where to go in Night City to start the quest.\n\n\n\nFor most people, the quest should begin fairly easily. If you boot up the game, you should receive a text message from someone named Jim B (a reference to Balatro\u2019s clown mascot Jimbo) who will send V on a treasure hunt around the city, with clues and photos leading you to areas adorned with hidden Jimbo logos. Throughout the quest, you\u2019ll find Balatro-themed cosmetics, including a trophy you can put on display in your apartment.\n\nHowever, as of this writing, the quest might be bugged, as some players, myself included, are not receiving a text message from Jim B upon start-up. I tried riding around Night City to see if the clown might get in touch with me, but had no luck. I also checked the spot where the first logo is supposed to appear, and it seems like it doesn\u2019t show up in the world if you haven\u2019t started the quest. We\u2019ve reached out to CD Projekt Red about this issue and will update the story when we hear back. In the meantime, if you\u2019re looking for some help on all the clue locations, YouTuber vinal has a video showing each location on Night City\u2019s map:\n\nAll of this launches alongside a line of Cyberpunk X Balatro merchandise including shirts and a hoodie, all of which are available for pre-order on CD Projekt Red\u2019s website. While Cyberpunk 2077 may be getting a little love even four years after its release, most of CD Projekt Red\u2019s team has been moved to other projects, including a sequel codenamed Orion. We don\u2019t know much about the game, but there\u2019s reason to believe it will have some kind of multiplayer mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

However, there are some very good free apps that can help restore your missing files or photos.\n\nCCleaner\u2019s Recuva and DMDE are among the best free data recovery apps that let you preview and restore a wide variety of files at no cost. I\u2019ll focus on the free versions, but also cover the more powerful paid apps.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSpecs\n\nRecuva DMDE Platforms Windows Windows, macOS, Linux Devices unlimited (Free), 3 (Professional) unlimited (Free), 1 (Express, Standard), plus 5 monthly (Professional) Support Email Email Free version? Yes Yes\n\nPricing tiers\n\nRecuva is a full-featured free data recovery app with only minor limitations. There\u2019s no customer service for free users. The app can\u2019t read virtual drives and you have to check for updates manually.\n\nBeyond that, you can use Recuva for free for as long as you like on any Windows computer. There\u2019s not a macOS or Linux version of Recuva and it doesn\u2019t work on mobile devices.\n\nLeading solutions like Stellar Data Recovery restrict free file restoration to 1 GB, which might be enough for lots of documents and several photos. However, the free version might not retrieve all your photos and videos since they take up more space.\n\nFor $25 annually, you can install Recuva Professional on up to three computers and contact support for technical assistance. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with data recovery software and drive technology and formats, technical support could be very important.\n\nDMDE also has a free version that\u2019s just as powerful as the paid app. However, it does have some restrictions. You can restore one folder and 4,000 files at a time.\n\nUnless you dump all you photos and videos in a single folder or store a huge number of files in one place, you\u2019ll need the paid version. Since only one folder can be restored with the free app, you\u2019ll probably need multiple scans to get back missing files.\n\nAn annual subscription to DMDE Express costs $20. There\u2019s also a lifetime plan call DMDE Standard that costs just $48. If you subscribe to DMDE Express for more than two years, DMDE Standard is a better bargain.\n\nDMDE also has professional plans, starting at $95, that let you install the app on more computers.\n\nFeatures\n\nRecuva has a wizard to guide you through data recovery. You select the type of files to restore, but the option of all files seems to make the most sense. Then you get to choose the drive or let the app scan all drives. That can take a long time, so it\u2019s best to select the drive you suspect has missing files.\n\nWhen you start a scan, the app immediately starts listing files that Windows File Explorer won\u2019t show. As the scan continues, more details appear including filename, the folder it\u2019s in, the modification date, size, and more.\n\nRecuva also estimates the recoverability of each file and optionally shows a preview. Those are the most valuable details. If image previews look correct and files are rated with excellent recoverability, the app should be able to restore them.\n\nIn my review of Recuva Professional, I found it to be useful in recovering data from my external hard disk drive (HDD) and my thumb drive. It found 158 of 163 files in the HDD test, which is good, but not great.\n\nDMDE is easy to get started with, but some features can be a little confusing. It\u2019s a much more technical app with powerful and dangerous features like disk editing. It\u2019s wise to make sure you understand what will happen before making a change.\n\nBasic operation is straightforward. You select a drive, start a scan, and watch the file list appear. DMDE shows the folders in a left sidebar and files to the right. It fills in the filename, size, modification date, and shows an optional preview.\n\nThe preview is important since DMDE doesn\u2019t give a recoverability estimate. In my review, DMDE Free restored all 55 files in my folder, but none of the images in subfolders. I\u2019d need the paid version to get everything in one pass.\n\nAs a workaround, I switched to raw recovery, which ignores my folder structure and groups restored files by type. With this trick, I got 162 of 165 files, but with randomly generated numeric filenames.\n\nThe paid version of DMDE managed to restore all my HDD files, but the first letter of each folder was replaced with an underscore \u201c_\u201d symbol.\n\nSolid-state drive (SSD) recovery is almost impossible and neither app could restore a single file in these tests. EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Pro is only app I\u2019ve tested that has successfully undeleted SSD files, which might have been due to lucky timing.\n\nSupport\n\nRecuva has a very limited help center and only offers email support to subscribers. The app has been around for decades, so your best bet is a web search if you need help with the free version.\n\nDMDE doesn\u2019t restrict help to paying customers, giving it an edge against Recuva. Support is via email, so it could take up to 24 hours to get a reply. DMDE\u2019s resource center features tutorials, a manual, and an FAQ so you can get answers faster.\n\nPopular data recovery apps like Disk Drill Pro offer live chat support, but cost more.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nThere\u2019s no need to upload data to recover files, so your files will remain private. However, if you email support or subscribe, your email address and financial information will be on record. That means cybersecurity is worth considering.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any record of a data breach at DMDE, but the developer of Recuva, CCleaner has had some issues. CCleaner has been hit by three major data breaches, one as recent as 2023.\n\nWhich data recovery app is right for you?\n\nThe free versions of Recuva and DMDE are both effective with HDD file recovery. While DMDE restored more data in my tests, it requires multiple passes to get back folders. Recuva is easier to use, but couldn\u2019t find as many missing files.\n\nWhile you could download and run both, HDD scans can be time-consuming, so it\u2019s better to pick one. If you absolutely can\u2019t pay to restore missing files, Recuva has the better free app.\n\nHowever, DMDE\u2019s $20 and Recuva\u2019s $25 annual subscription prices are incredibly affordable. If you\u2019re going to the trouble of scanning and restoring files, it\u2019s worth saving yourself time and effort at such a low cost.\n\nIf your photos, videos, documents, and other files are worth $20, I\u2019d recommend DMDE Express over Recuva Professional. If you anticipate needing to recover files in the future, a one-time purchase of DMDE Standard costs just $48 to use it on your Windows PC, Mac, or Linux computer forever.\n\nThat\u2019s why DMDE is high on our list of the best data recovery software.

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents The Red Magic 10 Pro is a sight to behold Show, substance, and then some A trust investment, above all else Pound for pound, an absolute ace\n\nI often question what exactly is a flagship phone. Some would argue that a top-tier silicon is the first requisite. Others go for a more holistic approach that involves a fast screen and big camera sensors.\n\nThe boundaries, however, vary wildly, depending on the brand you\u2019re chasing. Then there are mavericks like Red Magic, which play in the outlier category of \u201cgaming phones.\u201d\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAsus is the big dog in the game, but a starting price of $1,199 for the ROG Phone 9 Pro instantly killed the appeal for me. At that kind of financial hit, I can get a far more well-rounded phone like the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, the Google Pixel 9 Pro, or the iPhone 16 Pro.\n\nNow, along comes the Red Magic 10 Pro, offering Qualcomm\u2019s best silicon and a lot more, all for just $650. The ask is almost unbelievable from the moment you lay your eyes on the phone and go through its expansive sheet of niceties.\n\nThe Red Magic 10 Pro is a sight to behold\n\nEven if this was not a typical \u201cgamer-first\u201d device, I can easily recommend this phone for more reasons than one. There are also a few quirks, especially one tied to software longevity, that I will discuss later in the story.\n\nThe first phone I tried from the Nubia-backed brand was the first Red Magic Phone in 2019. It had a beautiful, sloping metal chassis with an RGB strip running across the back. It looked more like a gizmo from sci-fi flicks and was an absolute joy to hold.\n\nIn the years that have elapsed since, Red Magic shifted to a glass and metal design, but not in the same industrially bland fashion as mainstream players like Samsung and Apple. The Red Magic 10 Pro, I believe, is the finest design to come out of the brand\u2019s labs so far.\n\nDespite the asking price being lower than that of the entry-level phones from Google or Apple, Red Magic has used aviation-grade aluminum and Corning Gorilla Glass. And here\u2019s the best part \u2014 there\u2019s no camera hump or ring. This is a phone that can lie flat on its back.\n\nThe entire back is level despite fitting three cameras (two of them use a 50-megapixel sensor) and a 23,000 RPM physical fan. It\u2019s slightly taller than the iPhone, but narrower and roughly as thick as the Apple flagship.\n\nOh, by the way, the 50MP cameras at the back click sharp pictures, and the low-ight results surprised me. Have a look:\n\nThe see-through aesthetics of the phone aren\u2019t as gaudy as the LED-lined mess that is the Nothing Phone series. Yes, there\u2019s the whole RGB shebang here \u2014 it\u2019s a gaming phone, of course \u2014 but it has been done tastefully.\n\nThe fan, X chip highlight, and Red Magic logo in the lower corner light up. There\u2019s a red mode switch key on the side, breaking the all-black stylistic monotony. At the end of the day, you certainly won\u2019t be mistaking this phone for anything else out there.\n\nThere are a couple of other surprises, too. The Red Magic 10 Pro serves up a 3.5mm headphone jack, too. Plus, an 80-watt GaN power brick also comes in the box.\n\nThere are also two air vents on each side. These air passage lanes for internal cooling also mean there is no meaningful dust and water resistance on the Red Magic 10 Pro. That\u2019s the only weak spot in the phone\u2019s armor, but you get a protective case in the retail package.\n\nFlip the phone over, and you will get bowled over again. The bezels are uniform, and they are just 1.25mm, out-slimming the best out there. It looks stunning in person, and I can\u2019t help flaunting it with bright wallpapers.\n\nAlso, notice that there\u2019s no hole for the selfie camera on the front. The front camera is hidden underneath the screen, and this time around, you can\u2019t even discern it with the naked eye. It\u2019s the result of sandwiching two display layers, which involves a 20-step coating process and thrice as much time.\n\nI have seen implementations of an under-display camera from Samsung and a few other brands, and it doesn\u2019t always look great. What we have here is simply stunning and results in an interrupted full-screen experience. Yet, it\u2019s not all show and glitz here. There\u2019s plenty of innovative substance, too.\n\nShow, substance, and then some\n\nThe Red Magic 10 Pro offers one of the nicest screens I have ever seen. This 6.85-inch OLED panel offers a peak brightness of 2,000 nits. The refresh rate stands at 144Hz, while the instant touch sampling rate is 2,500Hz.\n\nThe result is an amazingly responsive screen that\u2019s tailor-made for fast-paced action games. Lending a hand in that gaming endeavor are a pair of capacitive shoulder triggers with responsiveness figures of 520Hz. Remapping them for duties like reloading, firing, and peeking is pretty convenient. You can also assign specific in-game controls to gestures like tilt or rotate.\n\nUsing these triggers almost feels like cheating in mobile games, as they offer a more console-like feel. For anyone reliant on the claw grip, these shoulder triggers are far more comfortable and serve as excellent inputs compared to awkwardly dealing with cramped onscreen controls\n\nOn most occasions, I am the one whom my pals carry in shooter games. But with these shoulder triggers, I can come out of battle royale rounds with some extra damage and a bit of the quintessential gamer respect.\n\nTalking about games, this phone is made for gaming above anything else. And it doesn\u2019t disappoint. Qualcomm\u2019s work with the custom Oryon cores aboard the Snapdragon 8 Elite has delivered some stunning results, not just in terms of peak performance, but also stability and efficiency.\n\nTo top that off, Red Magic has done some impressive thermal hardware engineering here. The company tells Digital Trends that the Red Magic 10 Pro is \u201cthe world\u2019s first phone to feature a liquid metal cooling system.\u201d However, this is not liquid metal in the same vein as desktop processors.\n\nInstead, Red Magic engineers have used an Indium alloy composite with potassium liquid metal medium, creating what one would roughly classify as a solid heat sponge. It is placed between the fan and the vapor chamber cooling kit. The heat absorbed from the vapor chamber is fed to the fan.\n\nOn the ray-traced loop test in 3D Mark Solar Bay, the Red Magic topped the charts and even surpassed the MediaTek Dimensity 9400. Running a synthetic CPU stress workflow, the peak CPU performance only throttled down to 90% of its peak value, which is mighty impressive.\n\nThe whole system makes a real difference, especially when you\u2019re eyeing long gaming sessions. After playing Zenless Zone Zero for about an hour on the Red Magic 10 Pro, the temperature barely crossed the 104-degree Fahrenheit mark, while the iPhone 16 Pro climbed above the 115-degree Fahrenheit level.\n\nIn half a dozen games \u2014 including titles like Call of Duty: Mobile and Genshin Impact \u2014 the phone lets you activate an in-house Frame Rate Boost tech that interpolates the performance from 60 fps to 120 fps and enhances the visuals to 2K resolution. There are a whole bunch of plug-ins that give a meaningful edge in games.\n\nNow, you are buying a phone like the Red Magic 10 Pro to play a lot of games, and that means it needs a fittingly large battery. On this one, you get a massive 7,080mAh battery, and to go with it, support for up to 100W fast wired charging.\n\nI got astounding mileage out of this battery with above-average usage, easily ending my day with over half of the electrochemical juice still left in the bank. Even if you squeeze about 3 to 4 hours of graphics-intensive games into the mix, you still won\u2019t have to hunt for a charger.\n\nWith the supplied 80W unit, you can get the phone charged halfway in roughly 15 minutes and it takes little over 35 minutes for a full charge. Those figures beat the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro. Plus, there\u2019s also a cutoff system that only keeps the lights on, but doesn\u2019t supply any electrical power to the battery.\n\nThere\u2019s also a setting that automatically enables the fan to keep the battery cool during charging. The only key omission here is the lack of reverse charging, even though the battery is large enough to share some juice and still survive a whole day with ease. Wireless charging is also absent, but for the price, it is acceptable, especially when you have 100W wired charging at your disposal.\n\nA trust investment, above all else\n\nRed Magic has been selling phones internationally for over half a decade now, but so far, it has followed an online global sales pipeline. The lack of an on-ground outreach footprint and after-sales support channel would make any buyer do a double-take before handing over their hard-earned cash.\n\nIn case of any damage, you have to send the Red Magic 10 Pro over to the brand\u2019s office and bear the shipping costs, in addition to the necessary repair and replacement work. Red Magic doesn\u2019t officially sell repair parts, but you can find resellers hawking them on platforms like Alibaba.\n\nA healthy few Red Magic owners have imported the parts and got their phone fixed at a local shop or did it themselves. The former is the safer route. In India\u2019s national capital, New Delhi, I talked to a couple of electronics shops, and they were willing to handle the part sourcing and repair on my behalf, but the same can\u2019t be said of most other cities.\n\nThe other conundrum is the software update situation. Red Magic is only promising one year of OS upgrades (up till Android 16, which is already out for Pixels as a developer beta) and security updates for three years. That\u2019s bad. Really bad.\n\nYes, you likely won\u2019t be running into a situation where a game demands the latest version of Android to run. Moreover, Android 16 will not be devastatingly outdated in the next few years, so most of your apps and games will run just fine.\n\nIf you are, however, eyeing the latest shiny tricks of Android, then you have no option but to install a custom ROM. Unfortunately, the year 2024 hasn\u2019t been great for custom ROMs.\n\nAt the heart of the tussle is the Play Integrity API, which lets an app check whether it runs on a genuine Android device and in a secure software environment. Right now, it is flagging unlocked bootloaders and rooted devices \u2014 essentially anything that hasn\u2019t passed the standard Google GMS certification.\n\nEarlier this year, users of the two-factor authentication app Authy discovered that it will no longer support phones running a custom ROM. Why? \u201cIf it\u2019s not an official OS, we have to assume it\u2019s bad,\u201d explained Shawn Wilden, who works on Google\u2019s Android hardware security team.\n\nThat means the first set of apps to run into issues with custom ROMs will be banking apps, wallets, or other sensitive scenarios. Earlier this year, users reported that Google was blocking RCS messaging on rooted devices or those running custom ROMs.\n\nNot everybody agrees with Google\u2019s approach. \u201cPlay Integrity API is based on lies,\u201d the makers of Graphene OS wrote on Mastodon. There are a few \u201cfix\u201d modules to handle the Play Integrity fingerprinting, but as per reports, Google has also started \u201cmass banning\u201d them.\n\nPound for pound, an absolute ace\n\nWith so much happening in the custom ROM community, the real question is how you handle the Red Magic 10 Pro once it goes past the Android 16 lifeline or the three-year security update promise. Do you upgrade your phone then?\n\nIt\u2019s a $650 investment, as the very minimum. Do you simply turn it into a handheld gaming console that can handle 120 fps casting to a large screen in wired and wireless mode? Yeah, this phone does that really well, and so does its tablet sibling. It\u2019s not a bad option, given the Red Magic 10 Pro\u2019s primary appeal.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to see the outrageous level of hardware packed into this device, for nearly half of what established brands would take from your wallet. The silicon is top-notch, and with it comes a fantastic design, fast memory, a lovely display, console-like triggers, one humongous battery, lightning-fast charging, and a dependable pair of cameras.\n\nIs it a flagship, though? I\u2019d say yes. Is it a good value? Unbeatable, I reckon. Nothing even comes close. The only undoing is the brand\u2019s status as a minor player and the infrastructure challenges that come with that status quo. If you can ignore that, this phone will leave you mesmerized in more ways than one. Just don\u2019t forget to wipe it clean from time to time.\n\nThe Red Magic 10 Pro will be available starting December 12."

            "article_content": "The major tech companies have had a fraught relationship with federal regulators in recent years, with politicians from both parties finding different reasons to try and loosen their power and influence. Google is currently fighting against a recent court ruling that found it has an illegal monopoly on search and must divest its Chrome browser. The search giant has been defending itself aggressively in the case, arguing it has plenty of competition in the industry from the likes of OpenAI.\n\nBut a funny thing is that the same companies are happy to cry to the regulators about concerns of unfair or anti-competitive behavior when it\u2019s to their benefit. Case in point, Google has reportedly approached the FTC and asked the agency to end Microsoft\u2019s exclusive deal with OpenAI to provide cloud hosting for ChatGPT. It argues the deal limits competition and potentially could impose higher costs on developers seeking to use ChatGPT APIs in their products. Apparently, tech companies believe anti-competitive behavior does exist in the industry, it\u2019s just not them doing it.\n\nThe Information first reported on the news.\n\nMicrosoft has invested more than $13 billion into OpenAI and in return has gained access to the company\u2019s cutting-edge models as well as served as its exclusive cloud provider through Azure. These types of deals have been referred to as \u201cround-tripping,\u201d as Microsoft is giving OpenAI money that will ultimately go back into its own coffers. On top of the exclusive hosting agreement, Microsoft is also entitled to receive 75% of OpenAI\u2019s profits until it recoups its investment and afterward will still hold its equity in the company.\n\nThe FTC is already investigating Microsoft over its cloud hosting contracts. The regulatory agency is looking into allegations that Microsoft charges customers more to use its suite of services, like Office 365, if they use a different hosting provider, like Google Cloud. Of course, Microsoft software is ubiquitous in the enterprise world. If developers have to use Microsoft Azure in order to access ChatGPT, that would only make it that much harder to use other hosting providers. Google, of course, would likely welcome the opportunity to host ChatGPT, or at least put in a bid to do so.\n\nIn general, the United States prohibits any behavior intended to create a monopoly and harm competition and consumer welfare. The Clayton Act of 1914 in particular prohibits tying arrangements in which exclusive contracts force customers to buy one product in order to get another if those contracts lessen competition.\n\nIn recent years, however, tech companies have been able to argue against breakups by pointing to the fact that many of their services are offered for free or at the greatest convenience to consumers and therefore consumer welfare hasn\u2019t been harmed. The administration under Biden has taken a much different stance on the issue. In the case of Amazon, FTC chairwoman Lina Khan has argued that even though Amazon has historically kept prices low, it has done so in ways that pushed out competitors, such as requiring sellers on its platform to offer it the best price.\n\nGoogle itself has faced intense scrutiny over a\u2014yes\u2014exclusive arrangement with Apple in which it pays tens of billions of dollars annually to be the default search engine in Safari. Smaller competitors like DuckDuckGo have said that makes it nearly impossible to compete, as changing the default search engine is difficult and cumbersome for everyday people. The irony is not hard to notice.\n\nThere\u2019s optimism in Silicon Valley that the new administration will take a more laissez-faire approach to tech, especially as President-elect Trump is filling his cabinet with leaders from Silicon Valley. But it\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll intervene in cases like the one against Google. Republicans still disdain the company and believe it has been biased against conservatives in search results."

            "article_content": "Machine learning algorithms are a powerful tool for detecting anomalies in network traffic structure. In this way they can support the early identification of potential attacks But what is anomaly detection? Anomaly detection works by identifying patterns that deviate from anticipated behavior or normal baseline data, which can be indicative of a threat or cyberattack.\n\nThese anomalies could indicate fraudulent behavior or system failures in finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and cybersecurity, for example. By being able to detect these anomalies, organizations can protect themselves from attacks, or stop threats before they even occur, while keeping their data and systems safe. Think of it like an early warning system. Once the alarm is triggered by an anomaly, security teams can get to work, responding proactively to any issue.\n\nBear in mind that the amount of data that organizations handle is enormous. Network usage continues to grow, which means the volume of information being generated across those networks is also rising. Firewalls and antivirus software are not enough to protect networks.\n\nSophisticated attackers can infiltrate networks for long periods of time and cause damage.\n\nBy using machine learning tools, organizations can flag anomalies or outliers that could be overlooked in large datasets. Unlike signature-based detection, which relies on known attack signatures, these tools rely on meta tags and labels to automatically identify deviation.To be effective though, tools capable of detecting anomalies need high-quality data and models.\n\nAll Kinds of Anomalies\n\nThere are different kinds of anomalies of course. Three anomalies that an organization should be familiar with are point anomalies, contextual anomalies, and collective anomalies.\n\nA point anomaly is self explanatory. This occurs when an individual data point differs from the rest of the dataset. This could be a spoke in network traffic. An example of a point anomaly could be for example an unusual charge on a credit card, or use of that credit card in an unusual location. That could alert organizations to the possibility that the charge might be fraudulent.\n\nWith contextual anomalies, an individual data point is different from the rest of the dataset, but within a specific context. If a user logs into a system during non-business hours or from an IP address that doesn\u2019t match their geographic location, this could be a conextual anomaly.\n\nCollective anomalies occur when a group of data points differ from an anticipated pattern. An example of this could be a surge in network traffic from IP addresses that could be a coordinated attack.\n\nHow Can Machine Learning Help?\n\nMachine learning and AI have a big role to play in anomaly detection. They are ideal for identifying patterns in large datasets in real-time, as well as for spotting anomalies. A machine learning model could analyze network traffic patterns and identify deviations, such as surges in volume, attempted intrusions, or suspicious requests, for example. This eye for pattern recognition is key.\n\nLarge datasets, such as the ones generated from an enterprise network, exhibit complex behavior that traditional systems may struggle to identify. AI-powered solutions that rely on an effective data architecture, however, excels in recognizing patterns, learning from them, and accurately identifying any deviations or anomalies. Its ability to analyze network traffic in real-time can also improve the speed with which security teams react. For instance, in a network, an algorithm might flag a jump in login attempts. The system could then turn on its automated defenses, such as blocking questionale IP addresses. This helps to address threats.\n\nMachine learning models can adapt to identify new patterns, as they learn as the data is generated. Each time, actually, there is an attack on a network, machine learning models can make related changes by automatically incorporating new attack vectors in their detection algorithms. As such, defenses are expanded. This differs from rules-based models, where responses would have to be adjusted manually with every attack.\n\nThey also offer something called proactive anomaly management, in that they might predict where anomalies might occur in the future by observing changes in patterns over time. This is accomplished through closed-loop automation, where machine learning can correct issues as they arise. This happens thanks to a feedback loop of communication between monitoring, identifying, adjusting, and optimizing the performance of the network to enable self-optimization.\n\nRelying on such tools, false positives can also be avoided too, as machine learning can be trained to differentiate between normal changes in network traffic and real security threats. Sometimes the volume of data transfers might genuinely spike compared to baseline behavior, but machine learning will be able to distinguish between normal spikes and suspicious activities.\n\nFinally, machine learning tools are scalable and save users money over time. Rather than hiring big teams to do the grunt work, machine learning models can take over, freeing up time for the security team to focus on higher-level tasks.\n\nTaken together, your cybersecurity efforts will greatly benefit from machine learning-based anomaly detection. It helps to identify unusual network traffic, which could signify a cyber-attack or data breach. Early detection allows for quick responses, minimizing damage. It also improves operational efficiency while assisting with proactive risk management and decision making.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nOleg Bondarchuk is a Microsoft Azure Certified Solution Architect Expert with over 18 years of IT experience, including more than nine years of specialized experience in designing and supporting Microsoft Azure environments, also he holds IEEE Senior Member status .

            "article_content": "The world saw a staggering surge in conflicts over the past year. At least 233,000 people were estimated to be killed in conflicts in 2024, according to new data released Thursday by a prominent nonprofit analysis and crisis mapping project. The data, released today by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), shows in raw numbers how the level of conflicts around the world have doubled over the past five years, amid wars in Ukraine, Gaza, Myanmar and elsewhere.\n\nAmong the data for this year, ACLED found that the number of people killed in conflicts in 2024 had grown by 30 percent since the preceding year, from 179,099 deaths in 2023 to 233,597 in 2024.\n\nThe war in Ukraine was the deadliest in 2024, with 67,000 reported deaths, while 35,000 deaths were reported in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the end of the year, the number of acts of violence recorded by ACLED is projected to reach almost 200,000, a quarter higher than last year and double what it was five years ago, with sharp increases found in Lebanon (958 percent), as Israel staged a large-scale military intervention, and Russia (349 percent), which has seen more attacks amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe violence has remarkable reach. One in 8 people worldwide were exposed to conflict in 2024, ACLED found. Those living within five kilometers or less of conflict count as exposed. Palestinians face the highest level of violence in the world, according to the data, with 81 percent of the population exposed to conflict.\n\nThe peak may still be ahead. Clionadh Raleigh, a professor of political geography and conflict at the University of Sussex and founder of ACLED, said that she expected global conflict to continue its rise, pointing to \u201cpossible violent surges\u201d in Iran, Chad, Ecuador and Pakistan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe world may be entering a \u201cnew normal\u201d of conflict, said Paul Poast, a professor at the University of Chicago who tracks global violence and was not involved in drafting the ACLED report.\n\nThat would have political implications in the United States, where President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly pledged to \u201cstop war.\u201d Trump \u201cclaimed that he is going to solve all of these conflicts as soon as he enters office (if not before),\u201d Poast said. \u201cIndeed, it stood out to me that during his victory speech on election night, the first thing he mentioned was ending all of the world\u2019s conflicts.\u201d\n\nThe data over the past few years paints an unsettling picture: Few regions saw a decline in conflict, while both Europe and the Middle East saw major escalations. Research by other groups describes the same trend. This summer, a report put out by the Sydney-based Institute for Economics and Peace identified 56 active conflicts taking place at that time, which it said was the most since the end of World War II.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe founding hope of the United Nations, international peace is an increasingly distant prospect, as the trend builds over consecutive years.\n\nHigh levels of conflict worldwide have multiple and complex causes, including choices made by world leaders, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine in 2022. But there have also been global shifts in the way that conflicts are fought, according to the data collected by ACLED.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, conflict became more urbanized and concentrated, and the same places and communities have been attacked several times over,\u201d Raleigh said, adding that the world had seen a 300 percent increase in the use of bombing over the past five years.\n\nThe widespread use of missiles, drones and explosives by governments has added further to the levels of conflict, Raleigh said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome conflicts appeared to be tied to electoral politics, according to the ACLED data, with countries that held elections seeing a more significant rise in violence. Roughly 80 countries, together holding more than half of the world\u2019s population, held national elections in 2024.\n\nThe conflict data tracks incidents of what the authors call political violence \u2014 defined to including battles, bombings and other violent acts \u2014 and excludes nonviolent protest. ACLED notes it also recorded more than 143,000 protests in 2024.\n\nThe ongoing breakdown in global order and rising multipolarity, a world system in which power is more widely distributed, with global bodies such as the United Nations Security Council paralyzed, has led to major powers \u201casserting their regional influence and undermining one another,\u201d Poast said. U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the state of affairs as a \u201cpurgatory of polarity,\u201d in an address to the General Assembly in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nACLED, which has operated for as a nonprofit for just over a decade, collects its data through media monitoring as well as partnerships with international and local organizations. It aims to give a big picture view of trends in armed conflict through the collection of granular, detailed data.\n\nIn the year ahead, some of the conflicts could ease \u2014 particularly the war in Ukraine and fighting across in the Middle East. Some countries, like Madagascar, have seen a prolonged decline in political violence over recent years, according to ACLED.\n\nBut ACLED is predicting a 20 percent increase in conflict next year amid numerous regions of concern, including Colombia and Mexico, along with several areas of Africa like the Sahal and the Great Lakes region. The Middle East remains in a period of great uncertainty, while the risk of new wars involving China or Russia cannot be ruled out."

Instead, research potential replacements while your old PC or Mac is still running. This will give you time to check specs, read reviews, and identify the best deals. By creating a shortlist of potential devices, you'll be ready to seize discounts when they appear.\n\nSignificant discounts are rare when shopping for a Mac, but third-party sellers often offer lower prices. For Windows PCs , there are numerous opportunities for discounts, especially on older models or less supply-constrained devices. Monitoring prices for a few months can help you spot the best available deals, allowing you to purchase when the price drops."

Azure CTO Mark Russinovich\u2019s regular Inside Azure Innovations presentation went into some detail about how Microsoft is working to make its data centers more efficient.\n\nData center efficiency is becoming critically important, as hyperscalers like Azure are now a significant part of the load on the network, especially with the power requirements of large generative AI models such as ChatGPT. Much of that load is part of the cost of training AIs, but inference has its own costs. Microsoft has made ambitious climate goals, and increasing data center efficiency is key to meeting them.\n\nUnder the hood with Azure Boost\n\nFilling a data center with racks of servers isn\u2019t the best way to run them. Azure and other cloud platforms have a different view of their hardware than we do, treating them as discrete elements of compute, networking, and storage. These are put together in the basic building blocks of the service, virtual machines. No one gets direct access to the hardware, not even Microsoft\u2019s own services; everything runs on top of VMs that are hosted by a custom Windows-based Azure OS."

From the IAEA\u2019s unique laboratories, our scientists are using radiation to recycle plastics and create plants that can better withstand climate change, they\u2019re researching new targeted forms of cancer therapy, and much more. In the last couple of years alone, the IAEA sent seeds into space to see if we can develop even stronger variants; we sent scientists to Antarctica to collect accurate data about plastic pollution and we helped conservationists use radiotracers to combat rhino poaching!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are so many fascinating stories to tell about the cutting-edge nuclear techniques through which the IAEA assists countries in the fight against hunger, disease, climate change and energy poverty, to name just a few, and we are very happy to be telling them together with the Discovery Channel.\u201d\n\nIAEA Director of Communications Sophie Boutaud de la Combe added: \u201cWe are very proud of the films we make at the IAEA, where we have built a dedicated video team with award winning cinematographers and are delighted that the Discovery Channel will use our original footage to reach an even bigger audience. Accurate and engaging story-telling can do a lot to explain the benefits of nuclear science and technology in our daily lives.\u201d\n\nWatch original IAEA films on the IAEA YouTube channel here."
