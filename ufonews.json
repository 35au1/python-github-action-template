        "source": "STAT",
        "article_content": "Since the Nobel Prizes were created in 1901, just 24 women have received awards in the sciences. This year, that number stayed the same: All seven laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine were men.\n\nSome scientists have expressed frustration about the lack of women among this year\u2019s awardees, particularly the omission of two women who contributed to the work honored for the prize in physiology or medicine. Experts who study gender bias in the sciences say the Nobel\u2019s gender gap reflects the larger barriers to success faced by women in science \u2014 and that science is poorer for it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe men who received this year\u2019s prizes are \u201csuperstars,\u201d said Liselotte Jauffred, a physicist at the Niels Bohr Institute who has studied gender bias in the Nobels. But \u201cwhat are the mechanisms that make it easier for men to enter that pool of superstar scientists that could even be nominated for a Nobel Prize?\u201d\n\nCertain fields, like biology, chemistry and social sciences are reaching gender parity in undergraduate and graduate degrees. But representation falls further up the academic ladder \u2014 a problem known as the leaky pipeline. Some women are pushed out of science altogether because of experiences of sexism. Those who persist are less often promoted to senior professorships, and even fewer become chief physicians, department heads, or journal editors.\n\nEven once in academia, women are not given tenure as often as men. They are not listed as the key author on as many papers, are cited less often than male colleagues, and receive fewer prestigious awards overall.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFiguring out whether the Nobels reflect even more bias than academia as a whole was \u201cnot easy\u201d Jauffred said. Researchers had to account for the lag between when a discovery is made and when it is recognized, and for the lower representation of women in science over the years. But even when accounting for those factors, she and her colleagues found in a 2019 study that the likelihood that bias against women played a role in the decision of who gets awards was around 96%.\n\nThis year\u2019s Nobel for physiology or medicine, which was awarded to Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros for the discovery of microRNA, has attracted particular scrutiny with regard to gender bias. Many outside observers commented on the fact that Rosalind Lee, Ambros\u2019 wife and long-time collaborator, was not recognized for the discovery despite being a first author on one of the studies cited by the committee. To some, the story seemed to write itself \u2014 another Rosalind overlooked by the committee, much like Rosalind Franklin, whose contributions to the discovery of DNA\u2019s double helix were not initially recognized.\n\nThere are, however, reasons beyond sexism that can lead collaborators like Lee to get overlooked. The Nobel committee limits awards to three people, which some scientists have pointed out is an antiquated way to reward discoveries that are increasingly part of large collaborations.\n\n\u201cAny project of any complexity rolls out over years with many contributors,\u201d said Bruce Wightman, a biologist at Muhlenberg College who was in Ruvkun\u2019s lab and worked on an aspect of the discovery of microRNA. \u201cScience takes a village.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for UMass Chan Medical School said Lee and Ambros are \u201ccelebrating the Nobel Prize and view it as a recognition of the team\u2019s collaborative work.\u201d\n\nThe push to reduce gender bias in Nobel Prizes\n\nThat said, how credit is distributed to scientists that are part of a large collaboration may also be the product of bias. One study found that women who co-authored papers were less likely to receive tenure compared to those who published papers alone. This kind of collaboration didn\u2019t have any effect on men\u2019s ability to get tenure. Another found that women tended to receive authorship on papers or patents to which they had contributed less often than male colleagues.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Nobels tend to \u201crecognize people who were in a position of power and authority, instead of the people who actually made a discovery or had an idea or proved it experimentally,\u201d said Pnina Abir-Am, a historian of science at Brandeis University, who has studied collaborative couples in science as well as documented the women who were not recognized for the Nobel prize for RNA splicing.\n\nNewsletter Weekdays Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Sign Up Your data will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. You may opt out of receiving STAT communications at any time.\n\nThe Nobel committee is often \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d in who it gives awards to, Abir-Am said, favoring those who are heads of the lab where the research was conducted as well as those who have trained with other Nobel laureates. That means lower chances of receiving the prize for women, racial minorities, and more junior scientists who have made breakthrough discoveries but are less likely to be in positions of power.\n\nNobel winners also tend to come from socioeconomically privileged backgrounds, according to Paul Novosad, an economist at Dartmouth College who studies access to opportunity and upward mobility. Novosad and his colleagues published a white paper this week finding that on average, laureates came from households with fathers in the 87th percentile of income in their country. Around half were in the top 5% by income.\n\nFemale laureates tended to be from even more elite families, which the authors write may be because the higher socioeconomic status helps them overcome some of the gendered obstacles in academia. But \u201cit means that elite women in the sciences are drawn from an even smaller socioeconomic pool than men, implying substantial misallocation,\u201d they write in the paper.\n\n\u201cIf children who are brilliant but poor fail to make it into the sciences, then all of humanity loses out on their potential discoveries,\u201d said Novosad.\n\nThings may be changing. The analysis found that the average socioeconomic status of laureates is creeping downward, which could signal a slow democratization of the sciences. \u201cThis kind of research is really important for the same reasons that we would like to see less elite demographics represented in various top positions,\u201d said Novosad. \u201cUnfortunately there is still a surprising amount of work to do just to convince men in senior scientific positions that these barriers exist at all.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne change that may make recognition more fair going forward is the growing practice of papers delineating what each author has contributed to a paper. \u201cJournals require scientists to say who contributed to conception and who contributed to experiments,\u201d Abir-Am said. This creates less ambiguity around who directly contributed to discoveries that are being honored by awards \u2014 as opposed to assuming lab heads or senior authors did the lion\u2019s share of the work. \u201cI don\u2019t care who is a director and who is a junior [researcher], I want to know who did what.\u201d\n\nThe organizations that select Nobel laureates have taken steps to address the laureates\u2019 lack of diversity in recent years. In 2019, Nobel committees began asking nominators to consider gender and ethnicity to encourage a wider range of diversity in nominees. And since scientists have to be invited to contribute nominations, \u201c[w]e are extending invitations to an increasing number of individuals from regions beyond traditional academic research hubs in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan,\u201d Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, told Nature this week. \u201cMoreover, we\u2019re actively identifying more women and younger scientists as nominators.\u201d\n\nJauffred has also seen improvement. She was motivated to write her paper on gender bias in the Nobels after Donna Strickland in 2018 became the first woman to win the Nobel in physics in 55 years. Since 2018, two more women have also won the Nobel in physics. Still, progress is slow.\n\n\u201cThe demography of fields has been changing for a long time, but it\u2019s not yet reflected in Nobel Prizes,\u201d Jauffred said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t see that diversity represented in the Nobel Prizes, of course we ask ourselves questions. Why does it have to be like that?\u201d\n\nMegan Molteni contributed reporting."

No-code platforms, equipped with codeless app design capabilities, empower your team to create and deploy apps without writing a single line of code.\n\nThis means that even team members who aren't traditionally tech-savvy can contribute to the app development process, significantly speeding up project timelines.\n\nImagine you're tasked with improving customer engagement through a new interactive app. With a codeless app design tool, you can drag and drop elements to assemble a prototype within hours, not weeks. This rapid prototyping accelerates development and allows for iterative testing and feedback, ensuring the final product meets user needs while aligning with your strategic goals.\n\nOptimal Flexibility with WYSIWYG App Builders\n\nA crucial element of digital transformation is flexibility\u2014the ability to pivot and tailor solutions in real-time as your business needs evolve. What You See Is What You Get, or WYSIWYG app builders, exemplify this flexibility. They allow you to build and edit your applications visually, seeing exactly how they'll appear to the end-users as you construct them.\n\nThis hands-on approach reduces misunderstandings and miscommunications between business departments and IT teams. For example, your marketing team can directly create landing pages and promotional apps, ensuring that the end design matches their vision without back-and-forth with developers.\n\nThis saves time and empowers your non-technical staff to execute their ideas independently.\n\nReducing Costs and Resource Allocation\n\nOne significant impact of no-code in your digital transformation strategy is cost reduction. Traditional app development involves significant investment in technical staff, extended development timelines, and often expensive fixes and iterations.\n\nNo-code platforms change this dynamic by minimizing the need for a large development team and reducing the dependency on external IT consultants or software development companies.\n\nIntegrating no-code tools into your strategy allows you to allocate your financial and human resources more efficiently. Savings on technical development can be redirected towards other critical areas, such as market research, customer experience improvements, or expansion strategies.\n\nMoreover, the ease of updating applications built with no-code tools means that maintaining and improving your digital assets becomes less costly and more manageable over time.\n\nDriving Business Agility and Competitive Advantage\n\nNo-code platforms give your business the agility to stay ahead of the curve. Because no-code development significantly shortens the time from concept to deployment, your business can respond more swiftly to market changes and emerging opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, no-code tools give you the competitive advantage of experimenting with and implementing new ideas quickly without substantial upfront investment.\n\nWhether it's testing a new customer service bot, a unique booking system, or a custom data analysis tool, no-code platforms let you innovate faster, learn quickly from real-world feedback, and iterate effectively.\n\nIntegrating no-code technology into your strategy offers a pathway to more than just technological advancement. It transforms your organizational culture. It democratizes technology creation, empowers your teams, and sprinkles both agility and innovation into your business.\n\nUsing no-code platforms is a no-brainer. They can dismantle traditional barriers to technology development, open up new avenues for growth, and position your business as a leader in the digital economy."
