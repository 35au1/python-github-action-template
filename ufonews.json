Alas, I was sitting on my porch, enjoying my new pair of night vision binoculars, when I saw something moving in the dark. It was too fast for it to be a plane.\n\nI can see over 1,300 feet away with these bad boys, and boy, I saw something alright. A flying saucer\u2014or a UAP as the kids call it these days. Better yet? My binoculars have a built-in camera, and I started recording. Can you believe they were only $99.99 (reg. $169.99)?\n\nSeeing is believing, and you need these to see\n\nWanna know how I know that UFO was real? My footage didn\u2019t save. The binoculars work, I have dozens of 36MP photos and 4K videos of tweety birds from my backyard, but those aliens? They wiped my darn UAP pictures. Those suckers. This is all I\u2019ve got:\n\nAt least I got to see them in the flesh. I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t wipe my memory (yet). The cool thing about these binoculars, compared to night vision goggles, is that I don\u2019t have to squint through uncomfortable eyepieces to get a glimpse at some aliens\u2014just look through the 4.5-inch LCD screen. I can also use it to play videos back.\n\nThe only slightly annoying thing is that they have to be charged, which is obvious since they\u2019re digital. But a 4,000mAh rechargeable battery lasts me quite a few nights of bird-watching and now UFO hunting.

When I'm not glued on the simple Windjammers-esque pleasures of Bushido Ball, I'm throwing my great big walrus body around perfect blue skies in Waldorf's Journey. I don't think I'll be able to ever stop playing it. In her review Kerry called it a \" superb retro-style smorgasbord \".\n\nIn addition to hosting 50 8-bit style console games belonging to a fictional 1980s studio, UFO 50 is really dedicated to the fiction of its games' provenance: each has a precise little history, and running through the whole collection are references to other games in the collection. It also has a terminal accessible in the main menu which allows players to enter eight figure codes.\n\n[Word of warning: If you'd prefer to discover all this yourself, be aware that potentially huge spoilers follow.]\n\nWell, players are discovering codes at a rapid rate, both on the Steam community forums and Reddit. Some are merely functional: the prefix EXEC- followed by the relevant four-figure game code will load that game. For example, EXEC-GOLF loads Golfaria. Similarly, the prefix HELP- will bring up a list of commands for the game. You can access GOLF's placement in the full list of games with the LIST-GOLF. If I enter LIST-GOLF, I see this:\n\n(Image credit: Mossmouth)\n\nNote that it only shows 17 entries at a time. If I enter the last game in that list with LIST-OVER, I see all the way up to 50. But what if I try to see beyond 50? Well, there's apparently a 51st game with the codename MIAS.\n\n(Image credit: Mossmouth)\n\nThis isn't the only way to discover the 51st game by the way. One Reddit user found the code in Barbuta, which is the first game in the UFO 50 menu and, if you don't mind me saying so, a huge glorious pain in my arse. There's also this Reddit thread with a bizarrely elaborate chain of events leading up to the discovery of EXEC-MIAS and beyond that I haven't followed myself, though suffice to say, there are other related codes that aren't just shortcuts.\n\nWhat is the 51st UFO 50 game? Well, it starts in a basement. The player character is a confused-looking humanoid frog, and after a bit of prodding around they discover they've been locked in the basement. It has a slightly eerie found footage vibe about it, despite sharing the same 8-bit pixel art as the rest of the games in the collection. After a few interactions you'll be able to access a computer in the basement which provides access to what seems to be a prototype version of Paint Chase.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

How deep does it go, how many prototypes can I access, and what the heck else is UFO 50 hiding? Needless to say, I'm as obsessed as I was when Spelunky HD still had hidden secrets."

        "source": "VentureBeat",
        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nUniphore, the global technology company known for its conversational AI and automation solutions, is taking a step towards simplifying how enterprises develop retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications. The company today announced the launch of X-Stream, a new layer in its core data and AI platform that enables knowledge-as-a-service and brings together powerful tools, connectors and controls for enterprises to mobilize their multimodal datasets for grounded, domain-specific AI applications.\n\nAt its core, what X-Stream gives enterprises is a unified and open architecture to combine all the fragmented steps of preparing AI-ready data into a seamless process \u2014 essentially serving as a one-stop solution and eliminating the need to use multiple tools across the stack.\n\n\u201cWith X-Stream, customers can fine-tune their data, convert it into AI-ready knowledge and seamlessly feed it into Uniphore\u2019s industry-specific, production-ready small language models or build their own. Our data scientists and engineers, drawing on years of experience, have solved for accuracy and hallucinations, ensuring safety and guiding customers towards AI sovereignty,\u201d Umesh Sachdev, the CEO of the company, told VentureBeat.\n\nSolving the data problem for RAG\n\nWith the rise of generative AI, the idea of RAG, where AI uses information from a specified set of databases and sources to provide accurate answers to complex questions, has become quite prevalent. Most enterprises today are racing to build dedicated RAG-based search and chat apps that could use their internal knowledge base to provide hallucination-free responses and ultimately drive efficiencies across different functions.\n\nHowever, when it comes to building (and scaling) such apps, things tend to get a little tricky \u2014 especially on the data front.\n\nIn almost every case of RAG, the information that an organization wants to use is spread across different sources and formats, from structured tables to unstructured text conversations, documents and videos. To get all this information together, the company has to cobble up several components and use data connectors/ETL tools (like Fivetran) to connect to their respective data warehouses, ERP, HCMs, internal apps etc.\n\nOnce the information is connected, they have to enable RAG flow by chunking the data, converting it into embeddings and storing them in a vector database using tools like Milvus, Weaviate or Pinecone. Then, to improve accuracy, they potentially add a graph RAG capability like Neo4j.\n\nAll these steps and tools, and then some more, add up very quickly and make it a hard stack to manage and operate. As a result, the project ends up taking months to mature into a scalable gen AI app.\n\n\u201cWe have been hearing from enterprise data leaders that they want a more efficient way to drive knowledge transformation from their own data sets across voice, video and text \u2013 instead of using traditional data platforms or libraries,\u201d Sachdev said.\n\nTo address these data gaps, Uniphore has introduced X-Stream, a unified and open architecture that brings all necessary tools and controls to one place.\n\nThe offering ingests multimodal data from over 200 sources and makes it AI-ready by running intelligent merging and transformation jobs. Once the initial processing is complete, it parses and chunks the data, converts it into embeddings and stores them in a vector database, assisting data teams in providing relevant data to AI teams, specifically for feeding Uniphore\u2019s industry-specific small models or their own for RAG and fine-tuning use cases.\n\nBut that\u2019s not it.\n\nX-Stream also generates knowledge graphs, where context and reasoning are needed, and creates synthetic data to fine-tune models specific to particular use cases or industries. Plus, it provides evidence management capabilities like factuality checks and chunk attribution to enhance trust in AI.\n\nThis essentially gives teams a complete solution to enhance their entire AI pipeline, from data preparation to final output. This allows for the development of production-grade RAG apps much faster.\n\n\u201cX-Stream is distinct for two reasons: it draws from Uniphore\u2019s 16 years of experience working with a variety of unstructured data across voice, video and text, and provides a unified and open platform capability that caters to a broad range of enterprise AI needs,\u201d Sachdev added.\n\nSignificant value promised\n\nWhile X-Stream is new, Sachdev noted that its ability to optimize AI and data components can drive up to 8x faster deployment for domain-specific gen AI apps that use in-house data and meet the highest quality, compliance and governance standards.\n\n\u201cUniphore offers a usage-based pricing model, and customers typically see a 4x-6x return on investment in weeks from going live,\u201d he noted.\n\nNotably, some of X-Stream\u2019s data capabilities are also provided by hyperscalers and startups, including Amazon (with Sagemaker), Tonic AI and Unstructured.io. It will be interesting how the new offering scales, especially as more enterprises adopt generative AI to power their internal and external use cases. Uniphore works with more than 1,500 companies, including DHL, Accenture and General Insurance.\n\nAccording to Gartner, throughout 2025, 30% of generative AI projects will be abandoned after proof of concept due to poor data quality, inadequate risk controls or escalating costs."

As of Thursday, only two premium iPhones that came out last year contain the souped-up processor required to power the AI features included in the update, but that will change Friday when four new iPhone 16 models reach store shelves.\n\nAll the iPhone 16 models, with starting prices ranging from $800 to $1,200, are equipped to handle the new technology, which the company is marketing as \u201cApple Intelligence.\u201d That branding is part of an effort to distinguish the iPhone\u2019s AI from similar technology already available in smartphones released earlier this year by Samsung and Google.\n\nThe AI features are being promoted as one of the main reasons to buy an iPhone 16, so releasing a test version of the software powering the technology now may prod more consumers to splurge on one of the new models as soon as possible\n\nThe AI technology is coming out in U.S. English only for now, but will expand into localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. in December. Apple plans to expand into other languages and countries next year. The testing of the AI software is beginning just a few days after Apple released its latest mobile operating system, iOS 18, to all its earlier iPhones.\n\nOnce the iOS 18.1 upgrade is installed, the often bumbling Siri is supposed to become more conversational, versatile and colorful, with a glowing light that will rotate around the iPhone's screen as it responds to requests. While Apple is promising Siri will be able to perform more tasks and be less prone to becoming confused, it won't be able to interact with other apps installed on the iPhone until another software update comes out at a still-unspecified date.\n\nOther AI features in the software update will handle a variety of writing and proofreading tasks, summarize the content of emails and other documents. The AI also will provide a variety of editing tools to alter the appearance of photos and make it easier to find old pictures.\n\nBut the initial update doesn't include other AI tricks still to come, such as the ability to create customized emojis on the fly or conjure other fanciful imagery upon request. Apple also plans to eventually enable its AI suite to get a helping hand from OpenAI's ChatGPT when users want it.\n\nBesides the new iPhone model, Apple's AI features also will work last year's iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max because they have the special computer chip that's required. The update will also bring the ability to record spatial video on those two iPhone 15 models that can be watched on Apple's $3,500 Vision Pro headset.\n\nBut the AI won't work on hundreds of millions of other iPhones that are still in use, a drawback that investors are betting will juice Apple's recently slumping sales of the ubiquitous device.\n\nThat expectation is the main reason that Apple's stock price has climbed by more than 15% since the company previewed its AI strategy in June, creating $500 billion in shareholder wealth. Some analysts believe the demand for new iPhones could propel Apple's market value above $4 trillion for the first time within the next year."

        "article_content": "A new algorithm tested on NASA\u2019s Perseverance Rover on Mars may lead to better forecasting of hurricanes, wildfires, and other extreme weather events that impact millions globally.\n\nGeorgia Tech Ph.D. student Austin P. Wright is first author of a paper that introduces Nested Fusion. The new algorithm improves scientists\u2019 ability to search for past signs of life on the Martian surface.\n\nThis innovation supports NASA\u2019s Mars 2020 mission. In addition, scientists from other fields working with large, overlapping datasets can use Nested Fusion\u2019s methods for their studies.\n\nWright presented Nested Fusion at the 2024 International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2024) where it was a runner-up for the best paper award. KDD is widely considered the most prestigious conference for knowledge discovery and data mining research.\n\n\u201cNested Fusion is really useful for researchers in many different domains, not just NASA scientists,\u201d said Wright. \u201cThe method visualizes complex datasets that can be difficult to get an overall view of during the initial exploratory stages of analysis.\u201d\n\nImage Figure showing how Nested Fusion learns latent structures at high resolution to produce distributions at greater impact. Above graphic focuses on the PIXL instrument the Perseverance Rover uses to scan Mars' surface.\n\nNested Fusion combines datasets with different resolutions to produce a single, high-resolution visual distribution. Using this method, NASA scientists can more easily analyze multiple datasets from various sources at the same time. This can lead to faster studies of Mars\u2019 surface composition to find clues of previous life.\n\nThe algorithm demonstrates how data science impacts traditional scientific fields like chemistry, biology, and geology.\n\nEven further, Wright is developing Nested Fusion applications to model shifting climate patterns, plant and animal life, and other concepts in the earth sciences. The same method can combine overlapping datasets from satellite imagery, biomarkers, and climate data.\n\n\u201cUsers have extended Nested Fusion and similar algorithms toward earth science contexts, which we have received very positive feedback,\u201d said Wright, who studies machine learning (ML) at Georgia Tech.\n\n\u201cCross-correlational analysis takes a long time to do and is not done in the initial stages of research when patterns appear and form new hypotheses. Nested Fusion enables people to discover these patterns much earlier.\u201d\n\nWright is the data science and ML lead for PIXLISE, the software that NASA JPL scientists use to study data from the Mars Perseverance Rover.\n\nPerseverance uses its Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) to collect data on mineral composition of Mars\u2019 surface. PIXL\u2019s two main tools that accomplish this are its X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectrometer and Multi-Context Camera (MCC).\n\nWhen PIXL scans a target area, it creates two co-aligned datasets from the components. XRF collects a sample's fine-scale elemental composition. MCC produces images of a sample to gather visual and physical details like size and shape.\n\nA single XRF spectrum corresponds to approximately 100 MCC imaging pixels for every scan point. Each tool\u2019s unique resolution makes mapping between overlapping data layers challenging. However, Wright and his collaborators designed Nested Fusion to overcome this hurdle.\n\nIn addition to progressing data science, Nested Fusion improves NASA scientists' workflow. Using the method, a single scientist can form an initial estimate of a sample\u2019s mineral composition in a matter of hours. Before Nested Fusion, the same task required days of collaboration between teams of experts on each different instrument.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest lessons I have taken from this work is that it is valuable to always ground my ML and data science problems in actual, concrete use cases of our collaborators,\u201d Wright said.\n\n\u201cI learn from collaborators what parts of data analysis are important to them and the challenges they face. By understanding these issues, we can discover new ways of formalizing and framing problems in data science.\u201d\n\nImage Portrait of ML Ph.D student Austin P. Wright, lead developer of Nested Fusion\n\nWright presented Nested Fusion at KDD 2024, held Aug. 25-29 in Barcelona, Spain. KDD is an official special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery. The conference is one of the world\u2019s leading forums for knowledge discovery and data mining research.\n\nNested Fusion won runner-up for the best paper in the applied data science track, which comprised of over 150 papers. Hundreds of other papers were presented at the conference\u2019s research track, workshops, and tutorials.\n\nWright\u2019s mentors, Scott Davidoff and Polo Chau, co-authored the Nested Fusion paper. Davidoff is a principal research scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Chau is a professor at the Georgia Tech School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE).\n\n\u201cI was extremely happy that this work was recognized with the best paper runner-up award,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThis kind of applied work can sometimes be hard to find the right academic home, so finding communities that appreciate this work is very encouraging.\u201d"
