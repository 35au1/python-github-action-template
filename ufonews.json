        "article_content": "RAIPUR: Following the recent deaths of elephants from electrocution and train accidents, the Chhattisgarh Forest Department plans to enhance its ' Haathi Alert App ' with advanced features for mapping electricity and railway lines.The upgrade will integrate contact details of railway and electricity department staff to prevent accidents. The new version will be released shortly.The Haathi Alert AI App now includes GIS layers of railways and power infrastructure. The forest department is collecting contact information of station masters and electricity department staff working in forest divisions to incorporate into the mapping system.Staff members will receive notifications when elephant herds enter specific zones, particularly within two to three kilometres of electrical lines and railway tracks.Electricity personnel will verify proper wire heights, whilst station masters will alert train drivers about elephants in corridors. Train operators will then reduce speed to ensure elephant safety.The power line GPS mapping will be integrated into the app's GIS layer. AI-powered alerts via calls, SMS, and WhatsApp will notify electricity and forest departments when elephants approach power lines.This system will help identify hazards in elephant corridors, including low-hanging wires, unstable poles, and illegal fencing. Officials can monitor elephant locations and power infrastructure through the app.Railway track GIS data from Google Maps will be incorporated into the system. Alerts will notify relevant staff when elephants are detected within one kilometre of tracks. Staff must register with the Alert App for this functionality.\u201cThe infrastructure mapping is complete, and the app will include manual power line entry options. The system upgrades should be finished within one month,\u201d said a senior forest officer.The Chhattisgarh Forest Department has implemented comprehensive measures to reduce human-elephant conflict, promoting peaceful coexistence through technology, community involvement, and administrative measures in elephant migration areas.Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and Head of Forest Forces V Sreenivasa Rao said, \"Forest department is dedicated to minimizing casualties of both elephants and humans, besides protecting livelihoods, and ensuring harmonious coexistence between humans and elephants.\"The Katghora forest division houses 40-60 permanent elephant residents in various ranges, whilst 90-110 elephants move through the Dharamjaigarh division. Elephants have established a permanent presence in several ranges of the Surajpur forest division.Among the many initiatives the department takes to prevent casualties caused due to human-elephant conflict is adopting technological solutions, including ODK (open data kit) Collect and Elephant Tracker apps for real-time monitoring.Control rooms equipped with thermal drones and night vision devices ensure continuous surveillance, regular power line inspections prevent electrocution risks, and warning signs and awareness materials are installed in affected areas.Community engagement initiatives include awareness programmes through Gaj Yatra and daily patrols by Hathi Mitr Dal. Forest staff provide protection during festivals and critical events, ensuring public safety in elephant-prone areas.Special protection measures are implemented during elections and other events. Forest personnel assist in safely escorting residents through elephant-prone areas. Farmers receive guidance about harvesting schedules to minimise crop damage.Through these comprehensive measures, the department continues to foster sustainable coexistence between humans and elephants in shared territories. Apps like ODK Collect (works without internet) and Elephant Tracker enable real-time updates on elephant movements, with nearby villagers notified via calls and messages. The Sajak Alarm System ensures timely alerts when sightings are reported through the app.Katghora DFO Kumar Nishant highlighted, \"In the past six months, elephants have been regularly monitored at 133 locations through this app. The department maintains special vigilance at these sites to minimize damage.\"In Pratapur, the efforts ensured that Chhath Vrati mothers safely returned home after the rituals. In Dharamjaigarh, a district-level wildlife protection committee, guided by the District Collector, formulates safety strategies.Compensation mechanisms have been streamlined to address crop and property damage efficiently. Surajpur DFO Pankaj Kamal noted, \u201cIn 2024, compensation cases amounting to Rs 72 lakh for crop damage have been successfully prepared and paid so far.\u201dSimilarly, Dharamjaigarh DFO Abhishek Jogawat stated, \u201cOver the past two years, a total compensation amount of Rs 2,16,58,445 has been disbursed in the Dharamjaigarh Forest Division to address cases of human loss, injuries, crop damage, and property damage.\u201dJogawat shared, \u201cIn the past two years, the Forest Department has safely escorted 78 people in the Dharamjaigarh forest range, 21 people in the Chhal forest range, and 2 people in the Kapu forest range to their homes.\u201dFarmers are also advised to expedite paddy harvesting in areas with potential elephant activity to minimize damage.Meanwhile, a larger herd of 90-110 elephants actively traverses the Chaal and Dharamjaigarh forest ranges in the Dharamjagarh division.In the Surajpur forest division, elephants have established a permanent presence in the Pratapur, Ghui, Ramanujnagar, and Biharpur forest ranges."

        "article_content": "Word.\n\nResearchers have discovered evidence of what they say is the world\u2019s oldest alphabet, believed to have existed in the Middle East hundreds of years earlier than other ancient scripts.\n\nThe early human discovery dating back to 2400 BC was made by analyzing clay fragments at a 16-year-long archaeological dig, Syria\u2019s bronze-aged Tell Umm-el Marra, east of Aleppo.\n\n3 Evidence of the first written language was found at Syria\u2019s Tell at Umm El-Marra archeological site. wmf\n\n\u201cPreviously, scholars thought the alphabet was invented in or around Egypt sometime after 1900 BC,\u201d said researcher Glenn Schwartz of Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\u201cBut our artifacts are older and from a different area on the map, suggesting the alphabet may have an entirely different origin story than we thought.\u201d\n\n3 Clay shards hold evidence that the earliest form of written language existed in modern Syria around 2400 BC, according to scientists. Johns Hopkins University\n\nCarbon-dated tombs were uncovered at the site, featuring six skeletons as well as gold and silver jewelry, cookware, weapons and pottery. The team also discovered four clay cylinders containing a form of alphabetic print.\n\nThe clay objects \u2014 about the length of a finger \u2014 were perforated, and Schwartz believes they were strung together during their use and operated as an ancient label.\n\n\u201cMaybe they detail the contents of a vessel, or maybe where the vessel came from, or who it belonged to,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout a means to translate the writing, we can only speculate.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian region is about 875 miles north of the great pyramids of Giza, where ancient Egyptians used hieroglyphics as written communication at least 500 years later.\n\n3 Researchers suspect the clay writing was used as a label. jhu\n\nJust south of Syria in modern-day Lebanon around the 11th century BC, the Phonecians \u2014 from whom the English word \u201cphonics\u201d derives \u2014 are credited with creating \u201cthe prototype for all alphabets in the world,\u201d according to UNESCO.\n\n\u201cAnd this new discovery shows that people were experimenting with new communication technologies much earlier and in a different location than we had imagined before now,\u201d said Schwartz."

The event, a highlight of the school year, transformed the school into a laboratory of discovery, where students freely rotated through stations designed to bring complex concepts to life in fun and memorable ways under the direction of the lower school science teacher Brandi Upright and parent co-chairs Joan Lenny and Catherine Gruen, according to a news release.\n\nAt the grand finale, students eagerly participated in the traditional Egg Drop Challenge, showcasing their engineering skills. Using a selection of materials, each class designed contraptions to protect an egg from breaking when dropped from four stories high in the sky.Students watched in suspense as their creations were put to the test, with top designs awarded for best use of challenge material, artistic design functionality, and class teamwork.\n\nHighlights from this year\u2019s spooktacular stations included:\u2022 Spider Slime: This introduction to polymers and ratios involved making stretchy, gooey slime, illustrating the science of chemical bonding.\u2022 Ghost and Witch Rockets: With hands-on experiments in Newton\u2019s Third Law, students launched mini \u201crockets\u201d to see action and reaction in real time.\u2022 Monster Mash Balloon Cars: Focusing on energy transfer, students constructed balloon-powered cars, learning how energy moves from one place to another.\u2022 Mr. Bone\u2019s Biology Lab: Young biologists explored bones and organs in this engaging biology lab, learning about the structure and function of the human body.\u2022 Potion Density Lab: A bubbling potion activity allowed students to explore density and fractions, observing how different substances separate by weight.\u2022 Trick-or-Treat Scales: Through comparing Halloween-themed items, students practiced weight and balance while applying math concepts of greater-than and less-than.\u2022 Goblin Milk & Creepy Crawling Candy Diffusion: design and watch candy molecules move from an area of higher concentration to lower concentration.\u2022 Spooktacular Glowing Good Time blacklight room introduced students to the wonders of luminescence, bioluminescence, and phosphorescence, where they discovered how certain organisms and materials emit light.\u2022 Phrankenstein Physics: Students launched objects using catapults, learning about potential and kinetic energy, with fulcrums helping transfer energy.\u2022 Vampire Vortexes: Through the vortex cannon, students experimented with friction and velocity, creating rings of air and observing movement and force.\n\nThe Nativity School\u2019s Math and Science Spooktacular has become a beloved annual event, inspiring young minds to explore and enjoy science and math.
