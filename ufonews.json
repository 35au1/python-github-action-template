        "article_content": "It\u2019s not just the Mulders of the world watching the skies anymore \u2013 the Scullys are getting involved. The US Department of Defense (DoD) has released its latest report on UFOs, with some intriguing stats and stories.\n\nAs part of a recent effort to take strange sightings more seriously, the US government set up the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to provide a way for people to report incidents so they could be officially cataloged and investigated.\n\nTo avoid half a century\u2019s worth of baggage, the government avoided the term \u201cUFO,\u201d rebranding sightings as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). The A in the new name originally stood for \u201cAerial,\u201d but was made more general to also cover weird things seen in space or oceans.\n\nThe latest Consolidated Annual Report on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena has some fascinating insights. This report covers the time period of May 1, 2023 to June 1, 2024, with 757 new incidents reported this year. That brings the total number of incidents reported to AARO since it began to 1,652. Of the new reports, 708 occurred in the air and 49 were seen in space, while there were no new ocean-based incidents.\n\nThe most common form that UAP take is lights in the sky, which accounts for 65% of the reports gathered this year. Orbs, spheres and otherwise round objects account for 22%. The iconic disk shape only made up 1% of reports, funnily enough.\n\nLet\u2019s get it out of the way early \u2013 according to the report, \u201cAARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology.\u201d Instead, 49 cases were officially closed after further investigation was able to pin them to mundane sources, with 70% being attributed to balloons. Drones, birds, satellites and aircraft accounted for the rest, with the expansion of SpaceX's Starlink constellation accounting for a growing number of cases of mistaken identity. Another 243 cases were recommended for closure, but will be peer reviewed first.\n\nFrustratingly, the vast majority \u2013 444 cases \u2013 lacked enough data to make a conclusion, so they\u2019ve been placed in an active archive. This means they\u2019ll be reopened if new data becomes available, and they\u2019ll be checked against new cases for signs of patterns or trends that could lead to explanations.\n\nAn unresolved case of a UAP flying past a Navy fighter jet US Navy/Public Domain\n\nIf you\u2019ve done the math, you\u2019ll notice we\u2019re left with 21 cases. And these are the really interesting ones \u2013 the sightings with \u201canomalous characteristics and/or behaviors\u201d that means they merit deeper analysis. These could potentially indicate breakthrough aerospace technologies operated by foreign (human) groups, the report says. The DoD will investigate with the help of intelligence and science and technology partners.\n\nThe standout case was a report from the crew of a commercial flight that almost collided with a cylindrical object off the coast of New York. AARO is still investigating what this might have been.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only potential safety issue, although the others involved Identified Flying Objects. The report outlines 18 times where drones were flown over protected areas, including one that stuck around for nearly two hours. In October 2023, drones were spotted flying over a nuclear facility in Virginia for six nights in a row. In another case, a drone crashed and was recovered by law enforcement, who are still investigating where it came from.\n\nSince a lack of data is one of the main problems, AARO is testing a new sensor system called GREMLIN. This uses a mix of 2D and 3D radar, GPS, radio, electro-optic infrared, and ADS-B flight tracking, which would help detect, track and identify UAP, and confirm or rule out obvious explanations faster. A short trial was conducted in March 2024, and a longer, 90-day test run will follow soon at a site of national security, the report says.\n\nHopefully that\u2019ll give us a better idea of what\u2019s going on in our skies, seas and space. It\u2019s probably not aliens, but the answer \u2013 or answers \u2013 could still be fascinating.\n\nYou can read the full report here (PDF).\n\nSource: DoD"

        "article_content": "UFO sightings and alien abductions are often reported by folks in the boondocks without any witnesses around to back up their stories.\n\nNot for Linda Napolitano, who was in 1989 taken from her New York City apartment and beamed onto a spaceship by extraterrestrials, as 23 onlookers bore witness, it is claimed.\n\nNapolitano's story has gripped UFO enthusiasts for decades. Now, the incident has exploded onto the small screen \u2014 and into the courtroom.\n\nA Netflix show presents the abduction as an 'elaborate hoax,' and Napolitano has fought back with a lawsuit accusing the streamer of defamation.\n\nHer complaint reopens a rift between a husband-and-wife duo of alien researchers and raises tough questions about those who say they've encountered visitors from space.\n\nAs millions of viewers stream The Manhattan Alien Abduction, and lawyers duke it out in court, concerns about who is being honest will doubtless intensify.\n\nWhile the US government is increasingly open to discussing aliens, it's unclear whether those with abduction stories are telling the truth, or suffering from false memories, mental health issues or just making it up.\n\nNapolitano, a stay-at-home mom, stands by her story that on the night of 30 November 1989, three aliens kidnapped her outside her 12th-floor Lower Manhattan apartment.\n\nLinda Napolitano, 77, has stuck by her story of being abducted by aliens from her Manhattan apartment in 1989\n\nThey made her levitate out her window and into a spacecraft hovering above the city, where they carried out experiments on her, before returning her to her bedroom, she says.\n\nBut this astonishing event wasn't her first brush with aliens, she claims.\n\nThirteen years prior, upstate in the Catskills, she recalls finding a strange bump on the side of her nose.\n\nThis was later identified as a mystery foreign object.\n\nSeveral months before the 1989 incident, Napolitano says she wrote to UFO researcher Budd Hopkins about that incident in the Catskills, and joined his support group for abductees.\n\nHopkins believed the object in her nose was implanted by aliens.\n\nAn X-ray purportedly shows the object, but, when a specialist came to check Napolitano's nose, it could not be found.\n\nAfter the 1989 incident, Hopkins scoured downtown for people to corroborate Napolitano's story.\n\nAbout 20 people witnessed it; some even said they saw Napolitano floating above her building, it is claimed.\n\nHopkins documented this in his book Witnessed: True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge Abduction.\n\nBut he used pseudonyms for the witnesses, casting doubt on their authenticity.\n\nAmong the purported witnesses were two guards for then-UN chief Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar \u2014 but these testimonies have also been questioned.\n\nNapolitano insists they were all genuine onlookers who saw the night's mind-boggling spectacle.\n\nThe Netflix recreates Napolitano's story of being levitated out her window and into a spacecraft hovering above the city\n\nThe docuseries presents archive footage of Napolitano pointing up to where she says the abduction took place\n\nUFO researcher Budd Hopkins' hypnosis sessions with Napolitano have been called into question\n\n'If I was hallucinating, then the witnesses saw my hallucination,' she told Vanity Fair in 2013.\n\n'That sounds crazier than the whole abduction phenomenon.'\n\nHopkins' then-wife, Carol Rainey, a filmmaker and UFO researcher, was also embroiled in the case.\n\nShe initially believed Napolitano and they became friends, she said, but over time she grew skeptical.\n\nRainey says Hopkins interviewed abductees under hypnosis in search of suppressed memories.\n\nBut the results of his sessions with Napolitano were not credible, she said.\n\nThe three-part Netflix docuseries features interviews with Napolitano, 77, who now lives in Tennessee, and Rainey, who died in 2023.\n\nIt also features archive footage of Budd, who died in 2011.\n\nIn the show, Rainey, then divorced from Budd, said her ex-husband had 'lost his objectivity' and may have guided Napolitano's comments under hypnosis.\n\nShe vowed to 'continue to ask questions' about the suspect abduction story.\n\nIn her appearances, Napolitano maintains she told the truth.\n\nOnly a 'sociopath' would fabricate such a grand narrative, she says, while accusing Rainey of debunking her in a bid to 'get even with Budd.'\n\nNapolitano's story has gripped UFO enthusiasts for decades\n\nNapolitano (left) and Carol Rainey started out as friends but fell out over the abduction story.\n\nAn X-ray purportedly shows a mystery object in Napolitano's nose, but there are questions over its authenticity\n\nShe's in part backed up by her son Johnny, who appears in the documentary, though his likeness is obscured.\n\n'There\u2019s no way I believe she would want to make anything like this up,' he says.\n\nHe recalls seeing three 'beings' in the family living room, in what he calls a 'terrifying' experience that left him feeling 'hopeless.'\n\n'I just try to erase it from my life,' he says.\n\nAccording to Napolitano, the aliens were not done with her family after that night in 1989. She says they came back years later and targeted her family, giving them nosebleeds.\n\nNapolitano, Hopkins' estate, and others filed the lawsuit against Netflix, Rainey's estate, and others at New York Supreme Court, two days before the show started streaming on October 30.\n\nThe complaint seeks an undetermined amount of monetary damages for six claims, from fraud to defamation, and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n\nAnother request to stop the show from screening was not granted in time.\n\nThe complaint says Napolitano 'was not remotely close to be like or appear as the person that is on screen' and that she 'never had any bone to pick' with Rainey.\n\nNapolitano 'was set up as such a villain for purposes of controversy and conflict, all of which was a patently and deliberately false portrayal to support the false narrative of the truth,' it adds.\n\nNetflix did not answer our request for comment.\n\nNapolitano told DailyMail.com that she could not 'take any risks' by discussing her abduction amid the lawsuit.\n\n'I don't talk about the case at all,' she said."

Maybe, but not because of Apple Intelligence.\n\nThis past week Google officially launched the Gemini app on iOS, allowing iPhone users to get the complete Gemini AI experience. The app is launching just weeks after Apple released the first version of its new Apple Intelligence AI platform, which also included a ChatGPT integration.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis means the iPhone now has access to all of the three biggest AI platforms... well, sort of. Here's what iPhone users should know about the new Gemini app, how it compares to Apple Intelligence, and why the iPhone could be the best device for AI now.\n\nGoogle brings Gemini app to iPhone\n\nThe Gemini app is now available for free on the App Store, although it is only compatible with iPhones at launch (sorry, iPad users). It includes the full suite of Gemini features such as text and image generation, live chat, study aid tools, image search, assistant features, and more. It's worth noting that you may need a Google Gemini Advanced subscription to access certain features.\n\nAll that's required to download the Gemini app is iOS 16 or above (and adequate storage, of course). That includes all iPhone models starting with the iPhone 8 and later, plus the iPhone SE 2nd and 3rd generation.\n\nThis is important to note since very few iPhones are compatible with Apple Intelligence right now. Only the iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max, iPhone 16/16 Plus, and iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max can access Apple Intelligence as of late 2024. That's a far smaller list of compatible devices compared with those that can download the new Google Gemini app.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis opens new options for iPhone users who want to tap into AI. If you can't access Apple Intelligence, you now have a competitive new alternative. On the other hand, if you can access Apple Intelligence, you might now be wondering if it's still the best AI tool for your phone.\n\nApple Intelligence vs Google Gemini app\n\napple intelligence vs google gemini\n\nApple Intelligence and Google Gemini are both AI platforms that use large language models to generate text and images and comprehend verbal, text, and visual input from users. Both have some similar features, such as text and image generation, assistant features, and writing aid tools. However, there are some major differences iPhone users should know.\n\nFirst, it's important to keep in mind that Apple Intelligence is still in its early stages. Google Gemini has been out for longer (previously under the name \"Bard\"). As a result, it is a much more fleshed-out AI platform right now. Apple Intelligence will eventually have most of the same features, but Apple is planning to slowly roll them out over the next year, so you may be in for a long wait.\n\nThe main advantage of waiting it out for Apple Intelligence is privacy. Apple Intelligence is only compatible with specific iPhones because it runs mainly on-device, meaning it doesn't send all of your data to the cloud to process AI tasks. Gemini is a cloud-based AI platform, so be aware that Google will most likely save and utilize data from your Gemini interactions in some capacity.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn contrast, Apple emphasized early on that it would not use iPhone users' personal data to train Apple Intelligence. If any data does need to go to the cloud for processing, it is completely anonymized, preserving users' privacy. If data security is important to you, Apple Intelligence may be the better AI platform if it's compatible with your iPhone.\n\nIs the iPhone the best device for AI now?\n\niphone 15 pro max in front of apple intelligence icons\n\nThe launch of Apple Intelligence coupled with the new Gemini app has quickly made the iPhone arguably the best device for AI, perhaps second only to a MacBook. At the very least, the iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max and iPhone 16 line-up are now the best phones for AI since they have access to the most AI algorithms.\n\nWe predicted early this year that apps would become the best way to experience AI, rather than dedicated devices. This has largely panned out, especially on the iPhone. That's partly due to the sheer reach the iPhone has thanks to its massive user base. iPhones make up five out of the top ten bestselling smartphones in the world right now.\n\nSo, if a developer wants to get their AI platform to a large number of people as efficiently as possible, launching an iPhone app is the obvious strategy. Of course, that might not be good news if you're an Android user. However, if you're intrigued by the explosion in AI development this year and want to have access to the most algorithms possible, it might be time to buy an iPhone."

This title expertly combines Max Payne\u2019s shooting mechanics, Alan Wake\u2019s otherworldly narrative, and Quantum Break\u2019s physics-based gameplay. It has been re-released and updated several times, proving the game\u2019s staying power. And now, it\u2019s coming to Apple\u2019s Mac computers.\n\nI briefly played Control Ultimate Edition on the new Mac mini M4, which was the first time I\u2019ve played the game since it originally launched in 2019. The high-resolution textures and buttery-smooth gameplay make it feel like a completely different game from the PS4 version I remember. I was also reminded why I fell in love with this game in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile I can (re)play Control right now on PS5, Xbox Series X and the best gaming PCs, I\u2019m eager to play through the entire game on one of the best MacBooks \u2014 particularly those packing the Apple M4 chip. Here\u2019s why.\n\nControl Ultimate Edition on Mac\n\nControl on Mac\n\nApple says that Control Ultimate Edition has been optimized for Macs and will have smooth performance, precise gameplay, and support HDR and MetalFX Upscaling. The game will also support hardware-accelerated ray tracing on Macs with M3 and M4 processors.\n\nGiven my brief time demoing Control, I can\u2019t speak at length about the experience. However, based on what I played, I\u2019m inclined to believe Apple\u2019s claims.\n\nThe otherworldly environment I explored, with its contrast of deep shadows and harsh lighting, looked equally captivating and disturbing. The power of the Mac mini\u2019s M4 chip (along with the Apple Studio Display I played on), truly helps Control come to life.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nI can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised Control looks and runs phenomenally on Mac. That\u2019s because I\u2019ve already played games like Resident Evil 4 Remake and Lies of P on the MacBook Pro 16-inch M4 Pro and MacBook Pro 16-inch M3 Max, respectively. Like Control, these titles run at buttery-smooth frame rates and look gorgeous to boot. I expect no less from Control when it eventually arrives on Mac.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about Control?\n\nMac mini M4\n\nWhile enhanced graphics and gameplay certainly make for a more enjoyable experience, these aspects wouldn\u2019t matter if Control wasn\u2019t already a great game. If you\u2019ve never played Control and plan to check it out on Mac, you\u2019re in for a treat.\n\nControl centers around protagonist Jesse Faden, who is a member of a covert government organization that investigates paranormal phenomena. The game takes place in the organization\u2019s headquarters, which has been taken over by a malevolent being who wants to cross over to our world. Jesse has to stop this being while also uncovering the secrets of her past.\n\nYou can think of Control as a three-dimensional Metroidvania game since it has numerous paths, some of which are only accessible via specific abilities obtained throughout the game. Jesse\u2019s Service Weapon is effectively multiple guns, taking on the properties of a handgun or a shotgun and her telekinetic powers allow her to float or grab objects and hurl them at enemies. All of these aspects combine to make for engaging and thrilling gameplay.\n\nOutlook\n\nWhile Control Ultimate Edition is admittedly an older title, it\u2019s a solid choice to bring to Mac. Not only does it pack in the full game and both of its expansions, but it looks and runs like a dream on machines with M3 and M4 chips.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf you\u2019ve never played Control and own an M3 or M4 Mac, you owe it to yourself to check out this game. There\u2019s no solid release date yet, but it should land on the Apple App store by early next year. We'll also know how much it will cost at that time as well."

        "article_content": "In the new horror movie, \u201cHeretic,\u201d Hugh Grant plays a diabolical religious skeptic who traps two scared missionaries in his house and tries to violently shake their faith.\n\nWhat starts more as a religious studies lecture slowly morphs into a gory escape room for the two door-knocking members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, underscoring just how well-suited religion can be for terrifying and entertaining thrill-seeking moviegoers.\n\n\u201cI think it is a fascinating religion-related horror as it raises questions about the institution of religion, the patriarchy of religion,\u201d said Stacey Abbott, a film professor at Northumbria University in Newcastle, England, whose research interests include horror, vampires and zombies.\n\n\u201cBut it also questions the nature of faith and confronts the audience with a debate about choice, faith and free will.\u201d\n\nHorror has had a decades-long attraction to religion, Christianity especially in the U.S., with the 1970s \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and \u201cThe Omen\u201d being prime examples. Beyond the jump scares, the supernatural elements of horror and its sublime nature pair easily with belief and spirituality \u2014 and religion\u2019s exploration of big existential questions, Abbott said. Horror is subversive. Real-life taboo topics and cultural anxieties are fair game.\n\n\u201cIt is a rich canvas for social critique and it can also be a space to reassert traditional values,\u201d Abbott said in an email.\n\nDeath, demons and other tough topics religion and horror address\n\nReligions and horror tackle similar questions about what it means to be human \u2014 how people relate to one another and the world, said Brandon Grafius, a Biblical studies professor at Ecumenical Theological Seminary in Detroit and an expert on Christianity and horror.\n\n\u201cSo much of religion is about how we grapple with the reality of death. \u2026 Helping us make meaning even in the face of that reality,\u201d said Grafius. \u201cHorror really serves that same process, as a way to reflect on death.\u201d\n\nNot only does Christianity translate well for U.S. audiences, it has a lot of raw material for moviemakers to work with, he said.\n\n\u201cChristianity emerged as a strongly dualistic religion, where forces are either good or evil,\u201d Grafius said. \u201cEven though the U.S. is moving away from being a nation dominated by Christianity, we still have that dualism deep in our bones.\u201d\n\nAmong the more recent religion-themed horror films, \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d franchise, including \u201cThe Nun\u201d movies, show paranormal investigators battling demons, Abbott said, while \u201cThe First Omen\u201d and \u201cImmaculate\u201d offer critiques of patriarchal attempts to control women\u2019s bodies.\n\n\u201cThese films seem to be a direct response to many of the debates that are happening in the U.S. these days,\u201d Abbott wrote in her email. \u201cThese different approaches to religion in horror illustrate the way in which the genre is engaging with a very live debate around religion or more specifically how religion is being used to assert control (which is what \u2018Heretic\u2019 is all about).\u201d\n\nGrant, who plays Mr. Reed in the new movie, told The Associated Press that he shared some of his \u201cHeretic\u201d character\u2019s skepticism, although not necessarily from a religious perspective:\n\n\u201cThere is a part of me \u2014 probably a not very attractive part of me \u2014 that likes to smash people\u2019s idols. Anyone I feel is being a bit too smug or too pretentious, I don\u2019t like to see that. I like to just take them apart a little bit.\u201d\n\nHorror can be challenging. It acts as a dark mirror that can reveal things people don\u2019t want to admit and fears they don\u2019t want to face, said the Rev. Ryan Duns, a Jesuit priest and theology chair at Marquette University in Milwaukee.\n\nIf done well, both religion and horror are unsettling, he said.\n\n\u201cReligion, when it unsettles, asks us am I living up to the person I have been called to be or am I complicit in systems of violence, oppression, injustice, going with the status quo,\u201d said Duns, who wrote the \u201cTheology of Horror\u201d and teaches a course on it as well. \u201cIn the horror movie, the monster threatens normality \u2014 threatens to destroy our status quo.\u201d\n\nBut they deviate from there. In horror, there is no way out, Duns said. He pointed out that defeating a movie\u2019s monster doesn\u2019t prevent sequels, hence \u201cJaws 2,\u201d \u201cTerrifier 3,\u201d \u201cReturn of the Killer Tomatoes\u201d and more.\n\nIn Christianity, it is Jesus and the Gospels threatening the status quo, but they offer hope and a way out, he said.\n\nTi West mixes religion into the narrative of his new movie, \u201cMaXXXine,\u201d a horror film about an adult film star trying to break into mainstream movies. West, who also wrote and directed \u201cThe Sacrament,\u201d a horror movie inspired by the Jonestown Massacre in 1978, said he doesn\u2019t actively set out to tell stories with prominent religion narratives, but religion can be ripe for mining.\n\n\u201cIt kind of depends on the story,\u201d West said, \u201cAnything with morality wrapped up into it, they kind of go hand in hand at times. And it\u2019s like religion is such a major part of every culture everywhere that \u2026 I feel like sometimes it\u2019s such a major part of life that gets put aside in movies.\u201d\n\nWhen religion works in horror \u2014 and when it doesn\u2019t\n\nBeyond poor storytelling, the mixing of horror and religion can go wrong if the movie is meant to offend the believers of a particular faith, said Lisa Morton, an award-winning horror author whose written books on Halloween and paranormal history.\n\nBut it can really go right. Morton\u2019s all-time favorite movie is \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d a holy horror icon and a peak example of the genre. \u201cThe Omen\u201d followed it.\n\n\u201cAll of the contemporary bloodlines kind of trace back through those two,\u201d said Morton. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how they keep getting rebooted over and over.\u201d\n\nAbbott agrees religion should be portrayed respectfully, just as she expects accuracy and respect for science in movies, though not every detail needs to be perfect. \u201cBut some horror films, like exorcism movies, are built upon the fact that they are drawing upon real rituals and then taking them to a more extreme conclusion,\u201d she said.\n\nOsgood Perkins, who wrote and directed \u201cLonglegs,\u201d a horror movie about an occultist serial killer, invented the religious material in his film, piecing together whatever felt right from his imagination and real life.\n\n\u201cI just make it up,\u201d said Perkins. \u201cBut then you catch hold of something like the Bible verse and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, this is really rich.\u2019 Beasts coming out of the sea with heads and horns and crowns and things like that. I didn\u2019t make that up.\u201d\n\nFor Duns, an accurate portrayal of religious rituals and symbols \u2014 without over doing it \u2014 can add heft to a scene.\n\n\u201cThe rituals of the churches have been stylized and lived out for centuries,\u201d Duns said. \u201cWhen movies are silly or are sloppy with it, the power of the gesture and the power of the symbols are lost.\u201d"

If we stacked up that many sheets of paper, the resulting tower would stretch into the stratosphere.\n\nIf we write this number in a computer in binary form (using only ones and zeroes), it would fill up only about 16 megabytes, no more than a short video clip.\n\nConverting to the more familiar way of writing numbers in decimal, this number \u2013 it starts out 8,816,943,275\u2026 and ends \u2026076,706,219,486,871,551 \u2013 would have more than 41 million digits. It would fill 20,000 pages in a book.\n\nAnother way to write this number is 2136,279,841 \u2013 1. There are a few special things about it.\n\nFirst, it's a prime number (meaning it is only divisible by itself and one). Second, it's what is called a Mersenne prime (we'll get to what that means). And third, it is to date the largest prime number ever discovered in a mathematical quest with a history going back more than 2,000 years.\n\nThe discovery\n\nThe discovery that this number (known as M136279841 for short) is a prime was made on October 12 by Luke Durant, a 36-year-old researcher from San Jose, California. Durant is one of thousands of people working as part of a long-running volunteer prime-hunting effort called the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, or GIMPS.\n\nA prime number that is one less than some power of two (or what mathematicians write as 2 p \u2013 1) is called a Mersenne prime, after the French monk Marin Mersenne, who investigated them more than 350 years ago. The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31 and 127.\n\nDurant made his discovery through a combination of mathematical algorithms, practical engineering, and massive computational power. Where large primes have previously been found using traditional computer processors (CPUs), this discovery is the first to use a different kind of processor called a GPU.\n\nGPUs were originally designed to speed up the rendering of graphics and video, and more recently have been repurposed to mine cryptocurrency and to power AI.\n\nDurant, a former employee of leading GPU maker NVIDIA, used powerful GPUs in the cloud to create a kind of \"cloud supercomputer\" spanning 17 countries. The lucky GPU was an NVIDIA A100 processor located in Dublin, Ireland.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nPrimes and perfect numbers\n\nBeyond the thrill of discovery, this advance continues a storyline that goes back millennia. One reason mathematicians are fascinated by Mersenne primes is that they are linked to so-called \"perfect\" numbers.\n\nA number is perfect if, when you add together all the numbers that properly divide it, they add up to the number itself. For example, six is a perfect number because 6 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 1 + 2 + 3. Likewise, 28 = 4 \u00d7 7 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.\n\nFor every Mersenne prime, there is also an even perfect number. (In one of the oldest unfinished problems in mathematics, it is not known whether there are any odd perfect numbers.)\n\nPerfect numbers have fascinated humans throughout history. For example, the early Hebrews as well as Saint Augustine considered six to be a truly perfect number, as God fashioned the Earth in precisely six days (resting on the seventh).\n\nPractical primes\n\nThe study of prime numbers is not just a historical curiosity. Number theory is also essential to modern cryptography. For example, the security of many websites relies upon the inherent difficulty in finding the prime factors of large numbers.\n\nThe numbers used in so-called public-key cryptography (of the kind that secures most online activity, for example) are generally only a few hundred decimal digits, which is tiny compared with M136279841.\n\nNevertheless, the benefits of basic research in number theory \u2013 studying the distribution of prime numbers, developing algorithms for testing whether numbers are prime, and finding factors of composite numbers \u2013 often have downstream implications in helping to maintain privacy and security in our digital communication.\n\nAn endless search\n\nMersenne primes are rare indeed: the new record is more than 16 million digits larger than the previous one, and is only the 52nd ever discovered.\n\nWe know there are infinitely many prime numbers. This was proven by the Greek mathematician Euclid more than 2,000 years ago: if there were only a finite number of primes, we could multiply them all together and add one.\n\nThe result would not be divisible by any of the primes we have already found, so there must always be at least one more out there.\n\nBut we don't know whether there are infinitely many Mersenne primes \u2013 though it has been conjectured that there are. Unfortunately, they are too scarce for our techniques to detect.\n\nFor now, the new prime serves as a milestone in human curiosity and a reminder that even in an age dominated by technology, some of the deeper, tantalising secrets in the mathematical universe remain out of reach. The challenge remains, inviting mathematicians and enthusiasts alike to find the hidden patterns in the infinite tapestry of numbers.\n\nAnd so the (mathematical) search for perfection will continue.\n\nJohn Voight, Professor of Mathematics , University of Sydney\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

It sounds like something from a sci-fi movie, but thanks to a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have proof that this icy continent was once home to a thriving jungle.\n\nResearchers discovered the first pieces of amber found in Antarctica during an internationally-led mission back in 2017. The discovery gives us an extraordinary glimpse into a 90-million-year-old landscape as vibrant as any tropical paradise.\n\nThe tiny amber fragments\u2014each only a millimeter in size\u2014hold massive secrets about Antarctica\u2019s past. The amber is believed to have come from the jungle of coniferous trees that once called Antarctica home millions of years ago. A new study published in Antarctic Science highlights how the trees responsible for the amber would have had to survive months of total darkness during the mid-Cretaceous period.\n\nImage source: tonguy324 / Adobe\n\nBut survive they did, leaving behind markers in the forms of fossilized roots, spores, and even pollen\u2014all of which have been discovered by scientists exploring the region. All of this has long hinted at Antarctica having a forested past. However, the discovery of amber fragments is the first tangible evidence that resin-producing trees actually thrived here at one point.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

The mid-Cretaceous was a greenhouse world, a model for what our warming planet could resemble in the centuries ahead. As scientists analyze the amber fragments from Antarctica\u2019s ancient jungle, they hope to learn how life adapted to extreme conditions.\n\nThose same extreme conditions could one day be a part of our daily lives thousands of years down the line. Learning how these trees and perhaps even the insects that existed then survived long, dark winters and still came back to thrive each year could be pivotal in helping us prepare for the long road ahead, especially as Antarctica\u2019s ice sheets continue to melt each year."

        "article_content": "With its decades-long legacy, the \u201cCan it run Doom\u201d meme is one of the internet\u2019s oldest and and most beloved gags. But it\u2019s grown into far more than that. It\u2019s a rite of passage for aspiring developers.\n\nTake a stroll through what has become my favorite subreddit recently, r/itrunsdoom, and you\u2019ll see the torch being valiantly carried forward to this very day. Since the It Runs Doom! Tumblr page stopped posting updates about a year ago, the Reddit community has grown to over 100,000 members that post and react to Doom being ported to just about anything. Calculators, credit card terminals \u2014 sure. But also the Nintendo Alarmo, an RS Media Robot from 2006, and a Pioneer DJ multiplayer. And that\u2019s just from the past couple of months.\n\nThe more down the rabbit hole I fell on weird Doom ports, the more I started to wonder where the idea originated \u2014 and more importantly, why it\u2019s even possible. Who\u2019s absurd idea was this to begin with? To discover the story, I\u2019d need to dig through hellish annals of 1990s internet history and speak to some of the wild-eyed hackers that keep the tradition alive today.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nWhy Doom?\n\nOur story doesn\u2019t start in 1993 when Doom was released. It starts four years later in 1997. On December 23 that year, two days before Christmas, id Software released the source code for Doom. Mastermind John Carmack, who had written the original code himself, penned a letter to the community that still lives on the GitHub page for Doom. Yes, even today, even after a massive corporation like Zenimax has swallowed up id Software (Zenimax was then swallowed up by Microsoft), the Doom source code still exists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a real good guess at how many people are going to be playing with this, but if significant projects are undertaken, it would be cool to see a level of community cooperation,\u201d Carmack wrote in the letter. \u201cI know that most early projects are going to be rough hacks done in isolation, but would be very pleased to see a coordinated \u2018net release of an improved, backwards compatible version of Doom on multiple platforms next year.\u201d Carmack even provided readers with a few potential project ideas.\n\nThe community started porting Doom immediately. I mean that literally. The first source port of Doom, DOSDoom, was published on the same day that the source code was released. You can still download it today. The original source code that id Software published was only for the Linux version of Doom. The DOS code wasn\u2019t available due to a copyrighted sound library \u2014 \u201cWow, was that a mistake,\u201d Carmack wrote in his letter. \u201cI write my own sound code now.\u201d\n\nFrom there, there\u2019s an extremely dense and complicated genealogy of Doom source ports that\u2019s been carried on for decades. Just last year, a fork of another source port called PrBoomX showed up. Frankly, that genealogy is out of the scope of this article. Covering it alone would require an article orders of magnitude larger than this one already is. I wanted to know about the weird stuff.\n\nThankfully, it didn\u2019t take long for things to get weird. The earliest oddball version of Doom I could find was for the Texas Instruments TI-82 graphing calculator, which was uploaded to ticalc.org on April 12, 1998. It\u2019s written in Basic, so it\u2019s less of a port and more of a shoddy clone. But even 26 years ago, there was interest in getting Doom to run on platforms it wasn\u2019t intended for.\n\nFor the next decade or so, there isn\u2019t much remaining on the internet showing off Doom running on these strange platforms \u2014 I mean, YouTube didn\u2019t even go live until 2005. There were likely plenty of \u201crough hacks done in isolation,\u201d as Carmack predicted, however. In 1998, several cameras with the DigitaOS operating system released, and as YouTube channel LGR showed off a few years ago, you can run Doom on those cameras. Keep DigitaOS in mind. We\u2019ll circle back to it in the next section.\n\nDid anyone actually get Doom running on one of these cameras in 1998? Not from what I could find, but my guess is that it\u2019s an answer lost to time \u2014 or at least, the internet. But from the early days of the source code being released and subsequently ported to different platforms, it\u2019s clear there was at least some experimenting happening. One of the earliest references I could find to a proper port of Doom was a Doomworld forum post from 2007, where the author links to a (now deleted) video on YouTube of the game running on a TI-83 calculator.\n\nIn October 2013, the It Runs Doom! Tumblr page went live, and after showing off some basic ports of the game, the author shared a video of Doom being played on a piano.\n\nAfter scouring Tumblr, Reddit, YouTube, and just plain ol\u2019 Google, however, there\u2019s one video that kept showing up. It\u2019s LGR\u2019s video of Doom on the TI-83. Published in 2017, the video has amassed over 7 million views, and is by far the most popular source for Doom running on an unconventional device that I could find in my research. The idea that Doom can run on anything dates back to when the game was first released, and it\u2019s been an idea that enthusiasts toyed with for years after. The modern obsession with running on Doom on a host of strange devices, however, seems to stem, at least in part, from LGR\u2019s video on the topic.\n\nDoom is iconic, and that no doubt is a reason behind the obsession with porting it. But there\u2019s also a concoction of various factors within the game itself that makes it such an ideal candidate for these types of enthusiast hacking projects.\n\nThe highly portable demon slayer\n\nDOOM running on REDSTONE COMPUTER - E1M1 in Minecraft!\n\nBefore getting into some of the more technical details of what made Doom so portable, none of that would have happened if Doom wasn\u2019t such a certified cultural touchstone. To say Doom was insanely popular is an understatement. Valve\u2019s founder Gabe Newell \u2014 who was working at Microsoft when Doom was released \u2014 estimated that Doom was installed on more computers than Windows in 1993. Even if that\u2019s hyperbolic, there\u2019s no denying that Doom was a sensation.\n\nJust months after Doom released, in 1994, Universal Pictures purchased the rights to make a film. Newell offered to do a port of Doom to Windows for free. Intel banned Doom from being installed on work computers. In a press release announcing the game, id Software wrote, \u201cwe fully expect [Doom] to be the number one cause of decreased productivity in businesses around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany began to marvel at how id might make companies like Microsoft or IBM look obsolete. Id had taken the shareware phenomenon and transformed it into a recipe for addiction,\u201d reads David Kushner\u2019s Masters of Doom. \u201cDoom was so compelling that people just had to have the full dose. Some dubbed it \u2018heroinware.\u2019 Forbes magazine published a gushing article titled Profits from the Underground about how id, in fact, was making companies like Microsoft obsolete. \u2018Privately held id Software doesn\u2019t release financials,\u2019 it read, \u2018but from what I can flush out about the company\u2019s profit margin, it makes Microsoft look like a second-rate cement company.'\u201d\n\nPopularity might have been the match that started the wildfire, but in order for Doom to run on so many different platforms, it needed three key elements. First, the source code needed to be freely available. Check. Carmack chose to take care of that step himself. After all, you could run the original Super Mario Bros on most modern electronics, but good luck finding the source code.\n\nBut here are the two points that need a bit more explaining. Source ports need to be available for just about any platform you could want, and lastly, the game needs to be written to run with extremely low software and hardware requirements, even by the standards of the late 1990s.\n\nThere are some other games that have some of these elements. But Doom, combined with its Earth-shattering popularity, hits all three. And as developer Sick.Codes explained to me, Doom became \u201cone of the most ported games on Earth, where someone, at some time, has compiled it for even the most random architectures.\u201d\n\nLet me demonstrate.\n\nHere\u2019s a link to a version of Doom that you can play in your browser. Nothing special, right? There are dozens of ways to play Doom in your browser, but if you look at the address bar, you\u2019ll find something interesting. That version of Doom that you can play is an SVG file. It\u2019s a vector file \u2014 something you\u2019d load up in Photoshop. They\u2019re supposed to be static images, and certainly images you can\u2019t interact with. But here is Doom running inside of an SVG that you can play in your browser.\n\nAnother important fact is that PCs weren\u2019t the ideal platform for playing games in 1993, when 3D graphics accelerators were expensive and hard to come by, and most of these chips were instead used in arcade machines and home consoles. If id Software was going to develop a game, and especially if the company was going to distribute it as shareware as it did with Commander Keen and Wolfenstein previously, it needed to run on just about anything.\n\nGzalo is part of the Argentinean volunteer group Cybercirujas that takes PC parts as donations and refurbishes them. The developer was able to get Doom running on a Verifone VX620 payment terminal that they found in the trash.\n\n\u201c[Doom] just needs a framebuffer (area of memory that maps to the screen) to output images to, and some very basic inputs. Software wise, you just need to be able to compile C for the target architecture, which is almost always one of the first requisites needed to write programs for 32-bit processors,\u201d developer Gzalo tells me. \u201cFor porting other newer games, you often need to have an operating system (typically something like Linux/Posix) and some way to support OpenGL, which is feasible, but requires more work.\u201d\n\nGzalo went on to explain just how little Doom needed on the software front to run.\n\n\u201cThe software from the terminal isn\u2019t modified. I found some guy in Brazil that had worked with this terminal a decade ago and still had the development certificate and a way to sign an application, so it\u2019s running valid signed code,\u201d the developer told me.\n\nHaving minimal software requirements is important, but the hardware side of things is just as crucial. Unsurprisingly, Doom didn\u2019t need a lot on the hardware front to run. The original system requirements for the game called for an 386 CPU running at at least 25MHz and 4MB of RAM. For some context, the 80386 was the first x86 32-bit processor Intel ever released, and it starting showing up in PCs in 1986 \u2014 seven years before Doom was released. Getting Doom to run on just about anything was intentional.\n\nCarmack himself said that, at one point, there was even a version that could run without a monitor and simply save screenshots.\n\nPretty close. The code was extremely portable \u2014 I had a version at one point that could even run headless and just save out screenshots. \u2014 John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) March 3, 2022\n\nThe basic software and hardware requirements for Doom brings us back to DigitaOS. The operating system is written in C, and it allowed third-party apps to be developed and released for the platform. The first two cameras released with DigitaOS \u2014 the Kodak DC220 and DC260 \u2014 both came with PowerPC 800 processors. By my estimation, they used the the MPC860, which can go up to 80MHz. LGR says the chip inside the DC260, at least, reaches 66MHz.\n\nAnd just like that, the requirements to run Doom have been met. We have a CPU far more capable than the 386 running at 25MHz, a touch of memory, and a platform capable of compiling code written in C. Just so we\u2019re not getting the timeline screwed up, this was possible in 1998. There was nothing that came later that suddenly allowed Doom to run on a Kodak DC260. The building blocks were all there from the start.\n\nThis isn\u2019t all just because Doom is some perfect program, however. It\u2019s very flexible, and highly portable to modern devices, but a significant part of this story comes down to the fact that the source code is free for anyone to edit. In the past nearly three decades, source ports of Doom have popped up for just about every platform imaginable. If you can\u2019t get Doom running on something with the original source code, you almost certainly can get it running with one of the many source ports.\n\nI know you\u2019ve been waiting \u2014 let\u2019s talk about the SVG. Doom can run inside of a vector file because SVGs support JavaScript. As the developer of the Doom SVG says, the vector file is simply running js-dos \u2014 an open-source, JavaScript-based DOS emulator \u2014 and then using one of the various DOS source ports of Doom. And although it may seem like some form of programming wizardry, the developer refers to it as no more than \u201ca fun use of a few hours.\u201d That says it all.\n\nHow Doom became a minimum viable hack\n\nIn 2022, Sick.Codes showed off Doom running on a John Deere tractor display. It was showcased at Def Con 2022, an annual cybersecurity and hacking conference that\u2019s been held in Las Vegas since 1993 \u2014 ironically, the same year Doom was released. Beyond just getting Doom running, the port featured a tractor instead of guns, allowing you to literally mow down demons. It\u2019s a fun little port, but Sick.Codes says it took months to get working. Why all of the effort?\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the right to repair movement, you\u2019ve probably already connected the dots here. John Deere equipment, created by Deere & Company, has been at the center of the right to repair movement, and not in a positive light. The corporation has had a years-long legal struggle with farmers due to its locked-down software. The equipment is nearly impossible to repair without Deere\u2019s direct involvement. Getting Doom to run on a John Deere tractor display is more than just a fun hack. It\u2019s a proof of concept.\n\n\u201cRunning Doom on the John Deere flagship agricultural machinery display, that they have spent thousands of hours developing over several years, shows that I have been able to completely and fully hack the device,\u201d Sick.Codes told me. \u201cIf I can run Doom on their flagship devices, I can do any other unauthorized modification to the device. I can brick it. I can enhance it. I can install third-party software. I can delete features, or I can install features that are supposed to cost money.\u201d\n\nPlaying Doom on a John Deere tractor display (jailbroken/rooted) at @defcon pic.twitter.com/ih0QUTGNuS \u2014 Sick.Codes (@sickcodes) August 14, 2022\n\nIn this case, Doom is proof of deeper, more important work. In a report from Wired that covered the story two years ago, the developer shared that they were able to access 1.5GB of logs stored in the machine due to achieving root access. These logs are only meant for certified John Deere repair technicians. With them, farmers or third-party experts can diagnose and potentially repair John Deere equipment, even without the Deere & Company\u2019s direct involvement.\n\n\u201cDoom requires a small number of libraries to run, namely SDL2 for graphics, so being able to run the game on a device that is not supposed to run Doom, it proves that you can run arbitrary software on the device you are working on,\u201d Sick.Codes told me.\n\nIt\u2019s fun to see Doom running on a tractor display, and I certainly don\u2019t want to suck the joy out of that. But it\u2019s important to highlight the wider context here. You can try to install other software on a device like this, but Doom is an ideal candidate for showing off this type of hack. It\u2019s visual, it\u2019s interactive, and it\u2019s a program built for a very specific purpose. It also draws a lot of attention \u2014 do you think we\u2019d see news stories about some command line interface running on a John Deere tractor display? Probably not.\n\nAlthough I don\u2019t want to downplay the amount of work that went into this \u2014 remember, this exploit took months to work out \u2014 Doom is also a relatively simple program to show off. Sick.Codes tells me that they used Chocolate Doom for the demonstration, which is a source port that\u2019s built to run on as many different configurations of hardware and software as possible. I mean, there\u2019s even a page of the Chocolate Doom wiki specifically devoted to how portable the source port is. If we didn\u2019t have the original source code, and if that source code wasn\u2019t ported so many times, we probably wouldn\u2019t have this demonstration. It would still be possible, certainly, but who\u2019s to say it would\u2019ve actually happened?\n\nWelcome to hell\n\nDoom is one of the most influential games ever made, and a large part of that comes down to the circumstances it was created under. Highly optimized code for PC met the shareware model to make the game wildly popular, and its modding community snowballed when the source code was released in 1997. Today, we not only have one of the largest and most accessible modding platforms through Doom, but also an application that has far outlived its original purpose.\n\nI started feeling nostalgic writing this story, and you might be feeling the same way after reading it. If you are, I\u2019d recommend downloading GZDoom and playing around with some of the insane levels that have been created over the years \u2014 you can find the original WAD files for the first two games archived online as well. If you want to go deeper, check out the documentary on MyHouse.WAD if you haven\u2019t already (the video has some 13 million views), or better yet, download the level for yourself.\n\nAnd, if you want to stay in the spirit of putting Doom in places it isn\u2019t supposed to be, some generous developers have documented their journeys across different devices. There\u2019s a write-up for installing it on the Ikko Activebuds earbuds, and another for installing it on a VoIP phone. There\u2019s also an in-depth post about porting the game to the aforementioned VX620 payment terminal.\n\nRegardless of how you enjoy, expand, or completely change Doom, have fun in hell. Hundreds of thousands of fans and developers are waiting there for you."
