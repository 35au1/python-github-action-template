            "article_content": "\n\nSergey Tinyakov // Shutterstock\n\nCities with the most UFO sightings in Texas\n\nWhen pilot Kenneth Arnold took off from Chehalis, Washington, in his single-engine airplane one afternoon in June 1947, he was looking for a lost military aircraft that had crashed. But what he found was something completely different\u2014something that would set off a cultural obsession in the U.S. that persists today.\n\nWhile flying around Mount Rainier, Arnold reportedly encountered nine curious, wingless objects speeding through the sky at 1,200 mph, faster than any plane at the time could. Arnold spent years afterward trying to describe what he had seen, reportedly using a term that has been ingrained in the American lexicon ever since: \u201cflying saucer.\u201d\n\nSince then, Americans have been uniquely fixated on the idea that aliens are somewhere in the sky above us\u2014and the number who believe that to be true is growing. In 2019, a Gallup survey found that 33% of Americans believed some UFOs were alien spacecrafts, while 60% felt they could all be explained by human activity or some natural phenomenon. Just two years later, in 2021, 41% of respondents said they believed at least some UFOs were alien-related compared to 50% who were confident any sightings could be explained by human behavior or scientific events.\n\nThere are two main reasons that belief in aliens has become so prevalent in the United States: government hearings and pop culture.\n\nAmerica\u2019s film industry has always been one of the most influential in the world, and a wave of science fiction films in the 1950s, like \u201cThe Day the Earth Stood Still\u201d and \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d perpetuated the idea that there are other life-forms out there. This continues today with alien-centric sci-fi staples like the \u201cAvatar\u201d franchise and the \u201cQuiet Place\u201d movies dominating the box office.\n\nRather than leave flying saucers to the domain of Hollywood, the U.S. government has addressed the question of UFOs, only adding further speculation. In April 2020, the Department of Defense released multiple videos filmed by military pilots that were thought to possibly capture UFOs. In July 2023, an Air Force veteran came forward to the House of Representatives claiming that the U.S. military has been keeping important information on \u201cnonhuman\u201d sightings secret since the 1930s.\n\nJust like it did in the 1950s amid Cold War paranoia, the lore of UFOs is also currently experiencing a resurgence as many Americans grow concerned about national security. The infamous Chinese spy balloon panic in 2023 and fears over being infiltrated by the Russian government have led to many reporting seeing UFOs in the sky. People are also mistaking the spike in Starlink satellites for extraterrestrial activity. In November 2024, the Pentagon announced that most reported sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs, as they\u2019re now known) can be attributed to balloons, drones, and other regular objects, while still noting that many objects lack a sufficient explanation.\n\nUAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it\u2019s easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they\u2019ve seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWhile New Mexico and Nevada are perhaps best known for UFO sightings, the National UFO Reporting Center data shows that the state with the most sightings is California, with more than 16,500 reports as of Nov. 21, 2024. But what do the numbers look like in your metro area?\n\nStacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Texas using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis.\n\nFor now, the U.S. government\u2019s official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America\u2019s alien obsession.\n\nNote: The images in this article are stock photos and do not necessarily depict the specific cities or events described listed.\n\nYou may also like: Cities with the fastest-growing home prices in Texas\n\n\n\nPeopleImages.com \u2013 Yuri A // Shutterstock\n\n#9.

            "article_content": "\u201cDo you have hope, and how does that feel?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sitting at my kitchen counter, talking to a bespectacled blue owl named Claire. She stares at me unblinkingly from the computer screen.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I reply, somewhat uncertainly. I ramble on for a few more seconds \u2013 something about how hope comes from family, and friends, and what that feels like \u2013 before pausing. Have I spoken for long enough?\n\nClaire appears satisfied with my response. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says stiffly. \u201cNow we will move on to secrets.\u201d\n\nAfter secrets, she asks whether I have anger (yes!), how it makes me feel (... angry?), whether I have fear (I do \u2013), and lastly, emotional pain (who doesn\u2019t?).\n\nFinally, Claire informs me that the interview is over. Soon, I\u2019ll receive the results of my $180 mental health risk assessment \u2013 as determined by artificial intelligence.\n\nI\u2019m not the only one to have my mental health assessed by AI.\n\nClairity \u2013 an AI app which can apparently detect mental health issues through voice recordings \u2013 is used by school-based clinicians at around 80 schools across Greater Cincinnati and, according to Clarigent Health, which developed the app, in universities, doctor\u2019s offices, mental health centers, and juvenile justice programs in California and North Carolina, in addition to Ohio.\n\nBut nearly a decade after researchers first hailed the technology as a scientific breakthrough in mental health, it\u2019s difficult to say whether Clairity ever met its intended goal of helping prevent youth suicide.\n\nNone of the Cincinnati schools that tested the technology, from 2016 onward, were able to attest to the AI\u2019s effectiveness. And clinicians and school administrators contacted by The Enquirer could not provide data showing how well the app worked, independent of the research funded by Clairity\u2019s developers.\n\nWhile trained on a majority white population, the app is being used on kids of all races and backgrounds, which has some experts questioning its effectiveness.\n\nStill, Clarigent is trying to expand it to more kids. A Spanish-language version of Clairity, and another algorithm that will analyze kids' language to determine their risk for committing violence, are currently in the works, according to Clarigent CEO Don Wright.\n\nAn offer schools couldn\u2019t refuse\n\nThe arrival of the youth mental health crisis left schools desperate for solutions. In 2021, a rise in suicides made it the second-leading cause of death for kids between the ages of 10 and 14, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter a student died by suicide at Three Rivers Local School District, former superintendent Craig Hockenberry said his community was devastated.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anything that we can do to prevent it, it was a win-win,\u201d Hockenberry said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter what the program was.\u201d\n\nEnter Mason-based startup Clarigent Health with Clairity, a solution that seemed too good to be true.\n\nAccording to the Clarigent, Clairity could empower clinicians to pick up on the subtlest signs of suicide risk and help youth who were suffering. While anyone can now buy a Clairity assessment from its website for $180, schools who enrolled in Clarigent\u2019s study could access it for free.\n\nClarigent Health\u2019s technology was first developed by Cincinnati Children\u2019s, where a researcher named John Pestian spent over a decade analyzing the language of suicide.\n\nCincinnati Children's denied several requests for an interview with Pestian and directed all questions about Clairity to Clarigent.\n\nAfter analyzing more than 1,300 suicide notes and collecting interviews of suicidal teenagers treated in Cincinnati Children\u2019s emergency department, Pestian developed an algorithm to find patterns in the ways that people express suicidality through speech. The machine learning algorithm would use this data to then make predictions about whether someone was contemplating suicide.\n\nThe impressive computing power of artificial intelligence, according to Pestian, could identify patterns in someone's voice data on a scale that humans never could.\n\n\"These are things you just don't pick up in conversation,\" he told The Enquirer in 2016.\n\nAccording to his research, the algorithm could identify not only words, but also nonverbal cues such as pauses and tone, that indicated suicidality.\n\n\u201cNo matter how smart we are, no matter how good we are, no matter how well-trained we are, the amount of information required for any given decision is moving beyond unassisted human capacity,\u201d Dr. Tracy Glauser, child neurologist and associate director of the Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation, said at a 2023 panel hosted by the hospital. \u201cThat\u2019s been our driving force.\"\n\nThe result of Pestian\u2019s research was Clairity\u2019s predecessor, an app first known as Spreading Activation Mobile, or SAM, then as MHSAFE. The idea was that guidance counselors could download the app on their phones and use it to quickly identify kids who were at high risk of attempting suicide.\n\nAll schools needed to gain access to the technology was to enroll kids in the study, with parent and student consent. The first was run by Cincinnati Children\u2019s in the 2016-17 school year, and the second, by Clarigent Health in 2019-2020.\n\nWhere suicide prevention felt precarious and unpredictable, these apps offered certainty, science and hard numbers. Their legitimacy was bolstered by experts at Cincinnati Children\u2019s. Moreover, this cutting-edge technology, supported by almost a million dollars in research funding from the National Institutes of Health, would be provided to schools at zero cost.\n\n\u201cWe all kind of dropped our pencils,\u201d said Hockenberry.\n\n\u201cIf they could do it with a potential suicide, they could potentially catch a school shooter,\u201d he remembered thinking.\n\nSchools have 'no data' to provide on AI\u2019s effectiveness\n\nThe Enquirer requested records from nearly 50 school districts in southwest Ohio and 15 in Northern Kentucky. Documents showed that Deer Park High School and four Cincinnati Public Schools \u2013 the School for Creative and Performing Arts and Dater High, Walnut Hills High and Aiken High schools \u2013 tested the 2016 version of the app. In the 2019-20 school year, Three Rivers Local School District and Lebanon City Schools also used Clairity.\n\nBut none of the districts had data to share on the AI\u2019s efficacy. Most said that it was private, accessible only to the clinician and the family of the child.\n\nTodd Yohey, former superintendent of Oak Hills Local School District and Lebanon City Schools, said he was \u201creasonably optimistic\u201d about the algorithm. But he wasn\u2019t sure how many kids were actually exposed to the app, and the school had no data about its usage.\n\n\u201cWe had hundreds of students that were seen by the clinicians,\u201d said Yohey, who worked with Cincinnati Children's to embed their clinicians within his schools. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they used the app.\u201d\n\nHockenberry, now a superintendent in a Youngstown suburb, left Three Rivers before Clairity was launched. \"I don't know of any of the outcomes,\" he said.\n\nBen Crotte, a former school-based therapist at the School for Creative and Performing Arts, estimates he recorded conversations with between 15 to 20 students \u2013 with their consent and their parents\u2019 \u2013 as a part of his participation in the SAM research.\n\nWhile he didn't receive the app's recommendations in real time, Pestian later told him that the AI identified two of his students as high risk for suicide, which Crotte already knew.\n\n\u201cThe app seemed to nail them and identify them very well,\" Crotte said.\n\nStill, Crotte said he didn't recommend hospitalization for either student. Had he received the app's results during his sessions, he wonders whether he may have felt \u201cmore pressured\u201d to recommend hospitalization, which he described as \u201cclinically unnecessary at that time.\u201d\n\nBest Point, a nonprofit provider of children\u2019s mental health services, participated in Cincinnati Children\u2019s early research in 2016, and now its clinicians use Clairity as a standard screening tool for kids ages 12 and up in around 80 schools across Cincinnati.\n\n\u201cWe felt confident that it had been trialed and tested,\u201d Debbie Gingrich, chief program officer of the organization, said.\n\nLearning to use Clairity has been \u201ca learning curve\u201d for Best Point\u2019s clinicians, Gingrich said, but Clairity has helped them identify \u201ckids at risk that they would not have otherwise expected.\u201d\n\nGingrich did not reply to multiple emails requesting data on the number of kids whose suicide risk would have gone undetected without Clairity's help.\n\nCourt tries Clairity, discontinues contract after 2 years\n\nHamilton County was the first in the country to use Clairity in its juvenile court. Headlines announced the partnership, which signaled AI\u2019s potential to help solve an intensifying youth mental health crisis, with fanfare and excitement.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be the first court in the country to use these cutting-edge tools to better understand and serve our children,\u201d said Hamilton County Prosecutor Melissa Powers, then a senior judge of Hamilton County Juvenile Court, in 2021. The court signed a $20,000 contract with Clarigent for the 2021-22 fiscal year and hoped the algorithm would help the court with referrals for mental health services and treatment interventions.\n\nSome kids in juvenile court aren\u2019t as forthcoming about how they're feeling, said Deanna Nadermann, the court's director of behavioral health services and special projects. She saw how Clairity could help reach those kids and speed up the referral process for children behind bars.\n\nFor those kids, and others suffering from mental health issues, Nadermann said it's a long process to \u201ccut through the red tape\u201d of getting them admitted to inpatient care.\n\nMegan Taylor, a licensed social worker and manager of the court\u2019s assessment center, which helps connect kids to counseling, therapy, and case management services, shared Deanna\u2019s excitement.\n\n\u201cI think we all thought this was going to be this great thing,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nTaylor, who oversaw the team of six staffers who would be using Clairity with their clients, remembers Clarigent Health\u2019s training for the app to be simple and intuitive. But in practice, it was anything but. There were technical glitches and issues with staying connected to WiFi. They bought Kindles and microphones to help with the recordings, Nadermann said, but her staff still ran into problems. Clairity peppered users with errors, saying it couldn\u2019t pick up the speaker, that the speaker wasn\u2019t talking long enough or was speaking for too long.\n\n\u201cHalf the time it wouldn't work,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe app would just spin and just buffer and buffer.\u201d And the way Clairity phrased questions were confusing to some of the kids. \u201cDo you have emotional pain?\u201d Taylor remembers one of the questions asked. \u201cThey were like, \u2018what?\u2019\u201d\n\nTaylor doesn't blame Clarigent Health for the difficulties her staff faced, which she mostly chalks up to the court's unreliable WiFi networks. The challenges of working with kids in juvenile court are unique, she added, so Clairity might work better in a hospital setting with staff who are clinically trained.\n\nClarigent said it tried to work with court staffers on the IT issues and safety protocols preventing youth from being positioned close to the device \"presented unique challenges.\"\n\nData provided by Clarigent Health shows Clairity assessed the mental health of 222 youth in juvenile court. One-third were labeled as having medium to high risk for suicide. But it\u2019s difficult to determine whether Clairity\u2019s evaluations were consistent with staffers\u2019 evaluations, or if those youth would have received mental health help anyway, because the court did not collect data on the app\u2019s outcomes.\n\nNadermann said she was disappointed that Clarigent Health\u2019s recommendation for medium and high-risk kids was to then administer a suicidality questionnaire. \u201cWhy don't I just do that assessment at the beginning?\u201d\n\nThe court discontinued its contract with Clarigent after its second year.\n\nCan AI predict suicide? Experts weigh in, discuss racial bias\n\nPeople tend to be open with their clinicians about their suicidal ideation, said Jordan DeVylder, associate professor of social work at New York University. But clinicians \u201chave a lot of trouble predicting\u201d those who will act on those thoughts.\n\n\u201cThat's where the appeal of these kind of machine learning approaches comes in,\" DeVylder said.\n\nComputers are good at detecting subtle differences in people's voices, and DeVylder is confident in AI\u2019s ability to detect suicidal language. But he\u2019s worried about the ethical implications of using AI that\u2019s too good at its job.\n\n\u201cIs it ethical to mandate treatment for someone who didn\u2019t even actually talk about suicide based on an algorithm alone?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnother potential limitation to consider is the bias of the training data.\n\nThere's not a lot of research on how nonwhite people express mental illness through language, and most machine learning algorithms are trained on white people, said Sunny Rai, a postdoctoral researcher in the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s department of computer and information science.\n\nThat's true of Clairity, too. According to an Enquirer review of research provided by Clarigent Health, three of the four studies on Clairity that published racial demographics had study populations that were 74% white or higher.\n\nRai's research used machine learning to show that Black people and white people express their depression differently on social media. While the white participants with depression in Rai's study tended to use more \u201cI\u201d pronouns that indicated excessive self-focus, the same was not true for Black participants.\n\nStill, Clarigent CEO Don Wright maintained that Clairity's algorithm \"is not biased.\" (He did not provide data or results of the 2021 NIH-funded study that he said proved that to be the case). Later, in a statement, the company said it \"takes active steps to mitigate bias\" by regularly testing its AI for \"fairness and unintended biases\", among other things.\n\nIf the data the algorithm is trained on is not representative of the population it will be used on, the use of AI to detect suicide risk is both scientifically and ethically dubious, said Augustine Frimpong-Mansoh, professor of health care ethics at Northern Kentucky University.\n\nThere are also questions about informed consent. Parents desperate to get their child mental health treatment may have agreed to Clairity being used without understanding the risks, he said.\n\n\u201cThey are likely to go along with whatever you have told them and sign on to it,\" he said.\n\nIt\u2019s also impossible to know whether Clairity is actually helping schools prevent suicide because there's no way to know whether a student who was flagged would have taken their own life, said Chad Marlow, senior policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nCompanies like Clarigent, Marlow said, are \u201ctaking advantage of schools and their fears and their incredibly strong desire to keep kids safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s based more on hope and adoption of marketing slogans than actual tested data,\" he said.\n\nWhat AI said about my mental health\n\nI\u2019m a 25-year-old woman whose first language is Korean. Most people Clarigent Health trained its models on do not look or speak like me. And yet, I couldn\u2019t shake my curiosity about the app\u2019s abilities.\n\nWould the AI be able to pick up signs of mental illness that I myself wasn\u2019t aware of? Maybe 11 minutes of hearing me ramble would be enough.\n\nFollowing my interview with Claire, the next step of my screener was connecting with a therapist who\u2019d reveal my results through phone or video call. \u201cNo appointment and no waiting,\u201d promised the email from Clarigent.\n\nBut the video call link buffered for 15 minutes, and the therapist who answered the phone was confused about why I called (I think there\u2019s an AI that\u2019s supposed to tell me whether I\u2019m depressed?). She put me on hold.\n\nWhen she returned, she apologized, explaining that Clairity is a new service. The AI detected anxiety, she says, but no depression or suicidality.\n\nWhen I later asked Clarigent for documentation of my results, the company told me Clairity detected no signs of mental illness \u2013 anxiety or otherwise.\n\nHow great would it be if that were true?\n\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, help is available 24/7.

            "article_content": "This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters.\n\nIn Room 126 at Denver\u2019s South High School, students in a Spanish language arts class got suggestions for improving their short essays from an artificial intelligence app called Magic School: \u201cYou could elaborate on your examples,\u201d the app advised one student.\n\nUpstairs, in AP Computer Science, a student shared the fix she made after feeding the Java code she\u2019d written for a bookstore inventory system into the same AI app.\n\nLater that October day, students in an after-school club at Aurora West College Preparatory Academy pitched hypothetical products in presentations augmented with AI images and text.\n\nFor A\u2019mariae, a ninth grader who envisioned a high-tech shoe that could be transformed from sandals to sneakers to boots with clip-on attachments, there was one problem. The trendy blue shoe the AI app had conjured on his laptop screen had a Nike swoosh on the side, a trademarked logo that would be off-limits for his brand.\n\nThese scenes illustrate how Colorado teachers and students are beginning to use artificial intelligence in the classroom \u2014 and navigate its limitations. Since ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022, the use of generative AI in schools in the state and across the country has become increasingly common. New York City\u2019s schools chief championed the use of AI before he left the post in October, and districts in New Jersey and Indiana are piloting AI tools.\n\nGenerative AI analyzes huge amounts of data to generate text, images, videos, and other kinds of content.\n\nFor the moment, many teachers, and students are approaching AI more as a toe-dipping exercise than a plunge into the deep end. Not only does it take time to test and learn the apps, they don\u2019t always work as intended. In addition, some districts are still figuring out what guardrails need to be in place to protect student privacy.\n\nStill, the sense of excitement about AI in education is real, with a flood of products on the market and a complementary stream of AI conferences, training, and webinars available to K-12 educators. Currently, eight districts in Colorado, ranging from Adams 12 to Estes Park to Durango, are participating in a yearlong project to build AI literacy offered through the Colorado Education Initiative, which has taken a leading role in ushering the state\u2019s schools into the AI age.\n\nKaren Quanbeck, vice president of statewide partnerships for the organization, ticked off some of the ways AI can help teachers: quickly adapting passages for students at different reading levels, providing personalized tutoring after school hours, and allowing students to have a conversation with a computer facsimile of a historical figure.\n\n\u201cMy goodness, just the potential for what this could do, for closing learning gaps, for really helping us rethink how learning experiences look because the \u2018stand-and-deliver\u2019 model is not always effective,\u201d said Quanback.\n\nJeff Buck, the AP Computer Science teacher at South and a 26-year veteran of Denver Public Schools, recently joined a different yearlong AI training program for educators. He\u2019s also taking a series of AI trainings offered by his district.\n\n\u201cThis is what keeps me going. I can learn something new and interesting, right? And kids are kind of interested, and so we\u2019re learning together, and I think that\u2019s really fun,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the learning curve, he said with a laugh, is \u201calso a massive time sink.\u201d\n\nOnce teachers master the apps, AI can be a time-saver, helping draft lesson plans and tests, taking a first pass at grading essays, or writing and translating parent newsletters. The cost of the apps varies, with basic versions often available for free.\n\nMois\u00e9s S\u00e1nchez Berm\u00fadez, the South High School teacher whose students used Magic School to get writing feedback, said he\u2019s generally been impressed with app\u2019s suggestions. Even its critiques of student poetry were decent.\n\n\u201cIt was not 100% but it\u2019s getting there,\u201d he said.\n\nBy using the app to give students \u2014 sometimes up to 35 in the classroom \u2014 immediate feedback on their first drafts, S\u00e1nchez Berm\u00fadez has more time to work with students individually.\n\n\u201cIt gives them meaningful work to do while I go one by one,\u201d he said.\n\nBut not everyone likes getting pointers from a chatbot.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really like using AI for the feedback. I\u2019d rather have a real person,\u201d said Juliana Gutierrez, a junior in Spanish Language Arts 3. \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand something, you can ask [the teacher] to explain it in another way, or in more of a personal way.\u201d\n\nOne floor up, Buck recalled how he\u2019d given his students the option to ask Magic School to review their Java code.\n\nThe response was \u201ctepid,\u201d he said. \u201cNot everybody is necessarily seeing the value right now.\u201d\n\nWhile most students chose to ask Buck or classmates for feedback, a few students used Magic School. One of them was Mimi Genter, a senior who\u2019d written code for organizing book store inventory.\n\nThe app returned a neatly organized list of the things she\u2019d done correctly, signified by green checkmarks. It also flagged a typo in her code, suggested an additional feature she could add, and closed by saying, \u201cKeep up the excellent work. You\u2019re really grasping these object-oriented programming concepts.\u201d\n\nGenter said it was only the second time she\u2019d used Magic School but appreciated that it was an efficient fine-tooth comb of sorts \u2014 instantly spotting a capital \u201cL\u201d that should have been lower-case.\n\nAs educators incorporate AI tools into their lessons, many are looking not only to make lessons enriching, but to build students\u2019 fluency in a technology that\u2019s here to stay.\n\nThey want students to understand how to craft prompts that return worthwhile information, to use AI tools to deepen learning without crossing the line to cheating, and to recognize the inherent weaknesses of artificial intelligence.\n\nTalley Nichols, who teaches high school history at Crested Butte Community School in western Colorado, sent out permission slips last spring asking parents if their children could use ChatGPT in class. She was pleasantly surprised by the response.\n\n\u201cI was worried about parental pushback, but I didn\u2019t get any,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, I got a couple of parents who were like, \u2018Thank you for doing this. This is important. They need to learn how to use this.\u2019\u201d\n\nNichols said her students like using AI to generate project or topic ideas: \u201cIt\u2019s really good at giving you lists of ideas, and then you can take that and run with it.\u201d\n\nBut she\u2019s proceeding with caution. When her students did research projects last spring on key figures from European cultural movements like the Renaissance, she had them print out the responses they got from ChatGPT, evaluate the quality of the responses, and then seek out other non-AI sources for further research. And when Nichols\u2019 students turn in final essays or projects that incorporate AI, they have to turn in notes, rough drafts, and edits to prove they\u2019ve done the work every step of the way.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s something that they could just go home and create on ChatGPT, I don\u2019t make that a homework assignment,\u201d said Nichols. \u201cWe do that in class.\u201d\n\nEducators are also helping students think critically about the racial and gender bias inherent in AI.\n\nStudents in Aurora West College Preparatory Academy\u2019s weekly after-school club, \u201cAI Studio\u201d quickly discovered that predisposition as they experimented with AI this fall in preparation for their marketing presentations. When A\u2019mariae asked the tool to produce images of doctors, it showed two older white men and one white woman. When he asked for an image of \u201cthree white teenagers,\u201d he got a picture of three happy white teenagers.\n\nNext, he said, \u201cI searched three black teenagers and it showed, like a mug shot.\u201d\n\nAsked how to deal with racist and sexist results, one of the other three boys in the club said, \u201cYou have to train your AI.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s exactly the message Antonio Vigil, Aurora\u2019s director of innovative classroom technology and the club\u2019s advisor, has been emphasizing all semester. He wants students to understand that they have to continually vet AI responses for accuracy, precision, and bias \u2013 and revise them accordingly.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou have to be the human in the loop.\u201d\n\nAnn Schimke is a reporter at Chalkbeat Colorado.

            "article_content": "As anyone who\u2019s ever glanced at some of the better entries at r/twosentencehorror will tell you, the genre thrives on restrictions. Here's a creepy good 'un: \"'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,\u2019 I silently prayed. 'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,' it parroted back from the next room.\" You can't do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!\n\nSilent Hill 2 remake\u2019s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. \"It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about horror is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings,\" she recently told TheGamer\u2019s Rhiannon Bevan.\n\n\"If you take Paranormal Activity, it cost pennies and it made millions,\" Kciuk continued. TheGamer follow up in their article with The Blair Witch Project, Get Out, and Terrifier 3 as examples of low budget horror films that made a lot more than they cost. Get Out, for example, was the highest grossing debut based on an original screenplay in history as of 2017, raking in over $250 million worldwide on a budget $4.5 million.\n\n\"This is one of the genres in both film and games where you actually can take very little resources, and the game or the movie looking cheap might actually be an advantage,\" Kciuk went on, citing the success of Buckshot Roulette. \"It's a very small game, and it was done in like a month or two, and it earned millions of dollars. Horror tends to have those breakout hits from very small teams, or even solo developers.\"\n\nI imagine that Kciuk doesn\u2019t actually find spreadsheeting to be \u201cthe interesting part\u201d about making horror. More, as she alludes to, the freedom to make some very effective work with limited resources. The proliferation of PSX-style horror speaks to her assertion that \"the game or the movie looking cheap might actually be an advantage\". I\u2019m reminded, fittingly, of how the original Silent Hill 2 turned short draw distances into an aesthetic with that game\u2019s iconic fog. There\u2019s some great examples of horror cinema turning restrictions into innovation, too, like Sam Raimi\u2019s shaky cam and travelling shots in The Evil Dead 2.\n\nStill, this is also might be somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy based on how few truly big-budget horror games actually get made. Outside of Capcom\u2019s Resident Evil series, and the occasional outlier like Alien Isolation, the fact that horror appears cost-effective might just be the result of small budget horror making up most of what\u2019s available. There are also big games that suggest the opposite, like the recent Alan Wake 2 - one of my personal favourites from recent years that\u2019s still struggling to recoup development costs."

            "article_content": "The more exciting, transformative, and revolutionary a science result appears, especially coming out of nowhere, the more likely it is to be dead wrong. So, approach science headlines with a healthy amount of skepticism and patience\n\nIn 2014 astronomers announced a whopper of a discovery: primordial waves from the earliest moments of the big bang. The South Pole telescope results validated the long-standing but still-shaky hypothesis of cosmic inflation, the scenario where the extremely early universe underwent a period of massively accelerated expansion. News reports went wild, as did the scientists involved in the study, in a celebratory news conference.\n\nBut it was all just a bunch of dust. Literally, dust. The team did not properly account for the impact of interstellar dust in their analysis. With proper calibration, the paradigm-shifting result disappeared.\n\nOr remember Tabby\u2019s Star? In 2015 astronomers speculated that its strange light pattern might be the product of alien megastructures. Cue media circus, high-profile talks, the works. Further analysis revealed that it was \u2026dust, again.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nMore recently, a group of astronomers claimed to find phosphine in abundance in the Venusian atmosphere, proposing that there might be some form of exotic life floating in the cloud tops. After the media hype died down, other researchers found significant flaws in the original analysis (at least it wasn\u2019t dust this time).\n\nIt\u2019s not just astronomy. Neutrinos can travel faster than light. Mozart makes your kids smarter. Dyeing your hair gives you cancer. Smartphones make us stupid.\n\nVery, very stunning. But very, very wrong.\n\nThe strong correlation between flashiness and wrongness comes from several factors. First, much, if not most, scientific research is wrong. That\u2019s why it\u2019s research; if we knew the answers ahead of time, we wouldn\u2019t need to do science. Many scientific papers are speculative, dependent on hyperspecific assumptions of controlled parameters, or just crazy ideas shot into the dark. It\u2019s through this constant bubbling of ideas and results and studies that we poke and prod at nature\u2019s workings, hoping to tease out some glimmer of deeper understanding.\n\nSecond, scientists endure perverse incentives to publish as much as possible\u2014to \u201cpublish or perish\u201d\u2014and to get their results in top-tier journals as much as possible. Since the biggest ones only take on the most impactful research, there is tremendous pressure in academia to inflate results and make big, bold claims, increasing the chances that their tenuous results will not hold up to further scrutiny.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s the modern-day hype machine. While many journalists respect scientists and want to faithfully represent the results of scientific research, publishers face their own incentives to capture eyeballs and clicks and downloads. The more sensational the story, the better.\n\nTrust in science continues to decline, reports the Pew Research Center, falling to only 57 percent of survey respondents viewing it as more positive than negative for society. I believe that\u2019s in part due to flagrant overinflation of scientific results. The more times that the public sees science contradict itself, the less likely people are to believe the next result that makes headlines. And the more times that scientists are loudly, publicly wrong, the more ammunition antiscience groups have in their fight against trusted experts.\n\nIt\u2019s not to say that science results can\u2019t be both interesting and right. The discovery of gravitational waves from merging black holes in 2015 was supremely fascinating, and exactly right. The release of the mRNA vaccines to fight the coronavirus pandemic were nothing short of miraculous\u2014and they did the job.\n\nThe vast majority of the time, though, from my experience in the worlds of science and science communication, if a result is interesting, it\u2019s probably wrong. And let me be clear here. I\u2019m sure you find most, if not all, scientific research absolutely fascinating\u2014as do I. But the more interesting a result is to the wider community, with more headlines, chatter, attention and raised eyebrows, the more likely it is to be worthy of a bit of healthy skepticism.\n\nJust peruse the latest batch of articles from your favorite science journal. Once you get past the technical jargon, you\u2019ll find that many papers are, in a way, boring. Not boring in the sense of not worth reading or exploring further, but boring in the sense that they would not make the pages of a high-impact journal, let alone your local newspaper. Most scientific papers are small steps, methodological techniques or slightly-off-the-beaten-path theoretical detours. Most scientific results come slowly, incrementally and with little fanfare.\n\nOnly a slim fraction of science results makes it from the journals to the newspapers, and even fewer make global headlines. The broad public only gets to view science through a highly filtered lens, and what makes it through that filter has a greater chance of being wrong.\n\nThe best approach to take with science results, news, and headlines is the same approach scientists use themselves: healthy skepticism.\n\nFirst, look at the timeline. Amazing results can be right, but they\u2019re usually backed by years, if not decades, of consistent, steady progress in those directions. It took a quarter century of effort before gravitational waves were found, and the roots of the mRNA vaccines go back to the 1990s. A big, successful result is usually the final step of a slow and steady slog.\n\nSecond, look at the scope. Bigger claims, with more far-reaching or broad conclusions, usually don\u2019t hold up. Good individual studies usually have carefully crafted limitations and clearly stated caveats; it takes a comprehensive effort from a community of scientists to build up a general consensus. Climate change proved true over time, black holes were a fringe possibility that added up in repeated observations, and exoplanets were searched for over decades before the first one was finally spotted in 1992.\n\nLastly, just be patient. Science is in part organized skepticism, and the first group of people to rigorously attack a new idea will be other scientists. New studies may rebuke, reaffirm or revise an existing result. Only time, and countless hours of work, will reveal if a conclusion holds up to scrutiny and the ultimate judgment of evidence.\n\nBeware big headlines; don\u2019t believe everything you see. But when study after study comes out, building up an interconnected latticework of theory and experiment, allow your beliefs to shift, because that\u2019s when the process of science has likely led to an interesting and useful conclusion. It\u2019s ironically through this process of healthy skepticism that trust in science can be regained. By viewing science results through a scientific lens\u2014initially skeptical but allowing beliefs to shift along with the weight of evidence\u2014we can develop the intuition we need to reject sensational headlines but know when a new result is right.\n\nIn the meantime, just remember that if it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s probably wrong.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."
