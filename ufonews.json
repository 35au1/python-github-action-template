        "article_content": "During a House Oversight Committee Oversight and Accountability subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, a former Pentagon official testified that information about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), or UFOs, was being withheld from the public by a \"cabal.\"\n\nLuiz Elizondo, who claims to be the former head of the Defense Department's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), said the U.S. government has been investigating reports of UAPs for decades.\n\n\"Although much of my government work on the UAP subject still remains classified, excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel, and the public \u2013 all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos,\" Elizondo said. \"A small cadre within our own government involved in the UAP topic has created a culture of suppression and intimidation that I have personally been victim to, along with many of my former colleagues.\"\n\nElizondo proposed three \"principal actions\" that should be taken:\n\n\"First, Congress and the President should create a single point-of-contact responsible for a whole-of-government approach to the UAP issue. Currently, the White House, CIA, NASA, the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and others play a role, but no one seems to be in charge, leading to unchecked power and corruption.\n\n\"Second, we need a national UAP strategy that will promote transparency and help restore the American public\u2019s trust at a time when the public\u2019s trust is at an all-time low. This strategy should include a whole-of-government approach, including the academic and scientific communities, the private sector, and our international partners and allies.\n\n\"Third, Congress should create a protected environment so whistleblowers, desperate to do the right thing, can come forward without fear. As it currently stands, these whistleblowers suffer because of stigma, a code of silence, and concerns about retaliation. These whistleblowers should be encouraged to come forward in ways that protect them against any forms of retaliation. Policies and procedures should ensure that protection. And for those who refuse to cooperate, it is up to the Members of this Committee and other lawmakers to wield their subpoena power against hostile witnesses and prevent additional Government funding to those UAP efforts that remain hidden from Congressional oversight.\"\n\nDr. Tim Gallaudet, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral, also testified during Wednesday's hearing about reported military encounters with UAPs.\n\n\"Confirmation that UAPs are interacting with humanity came for me in January 2015 when I was serving as the Commander of the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command. At the time, my personnel were participating in a pre-deployment naval exercise off the U.S. East Coast that included the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group,\" Dr. Galludet said.\n\nGalludet said that during the exercise, he said he received an email on the Navy\u2019s secure network from the operations officer of Fleet Forces Command. The subject line read in all capital letters: \"URGENT SAFETY OF FLIGHT ISSUE,\" he said.\n\nHe explained that the email was \"brief but alarming, with words to the effect of, \u2018If any of you know what these are, tell me ASAP. We are having multiple near-midair collisions, and if we do not resolve it soon, we will have to shut down the exercise.\u2019\"\n\nGallaudet said a now declassified video was attached to the email, which the very next day had disappeared from his inbox and the incident was never discussed again.\n\nGallaudet said the incident had always disturbed him for the remainder of his service and stressed that there is a public safety requirement for more government UAP transparency.\n\nThe biggest development out of Wednesday's hearing came from another witness, independent journalist Michael Shellenberger, who claimed sources inside the Pentagon revealed knowledge about a UAP program known as \"Immaculate Constellation.\"\n\n\"A source warned that simply printing the name \u2018Immaculate Constellation\u2019 could trigger government surveillance of me under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of whoever publishes it,\" Shellenberger said. \"'They won\u2019t comment on it, but talking about it will put you in the danger zone,' I was told. 'They enforce the secrecy with a lot of vigor.'\"\n\nShellenberger provided the subcommittee with a report from someone he has described as \"a current or former US government official acting as a UAP whistleblower.\"\n\nShellenberger said the whistleblower alleges that the DOD created the program \"Immaculate Constellation\" in 2017 after the New York Times published an article describing an informal Pentagon UAP program called \"Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program,\" or AATIP, headed by Elizondo.\n\nShellenberger explained that the whistleblower\u2019s report includes seven categories of evidence, detailing various UAP sightings collected by technical assets and U.S. military personnel.\n\nHe explained that the report described \"UAP characteristics that are difficult or impossible to observe with the human eye alone.\"\n\nLike other witnesses, Shellenberger is calling for more transparency.\n\n\"This issue cuts to the core of our democracy. UAP transparency is bi-partisan and critical to our national security. The incoming Congress and Administration should work together to address it as a matter of acute urgency. We deserve the truth,\" he said.\n\nYou can read Shellenberger's complete written testimony (PDF) here. Below is the alleged whistleblower's report submitted to the subcommittee and published by Rep. Nancy Mace (PDF).\n\nClick to open this PDF in a new window."

We had barely broken the sound barrier and hadn\u2019t even made it into space.\u201d\n\nElizondo\u2019s mandate at AATIP was to investigate the national security implications of military encounters with UAP \u2014 a mission he said was as important as anything else taking place at the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cWe have absolutely been able to confirm the existence of some sort of technology that has the ability to operate with anonymity (in) controlled U.S. airspace, operate over our sensitive U.S. military installations, and possibly \u2026 interfere with our nuclear equities,\u201d the former Defense official said. \u201cNow, if that\u2019s not a national security concern, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\n\nNewsNation is owned by Nexstar Media Group, which also owns The Hill.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "article_content": "Pentagon's UFO report finds over 700 new cases, with 21 the agency could not explain\n\nThe Pentagon and the Director of National Intelligence have released the annual report on UFO sightings and while they still haven't found any extraterrestrial origin for the more than 700 new reports that came in last year, there are about two dozen that have them really curious.\n\nUAP is the term the Pentagon and the intelligence community use to describe UFOs, which stands for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. The agency that reviews all of the new incidents being reported by military personnel and now additional federal agencies is the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).\n\nFrom May 2023 to June 2024, AARO received 757 new incident reports, 485 that occurred in that time period and another 272 reports from 2021 and 2022 that had not been previously sent to the agency. That's a sizable increase from previous reports, for example, last year's report cited 281 new reports during its review period, something Pentagon officials said Thursday was due to a greater awareness about reporting UAP incidents, not that they have been growing in frequency.\n\nThe Pentagon and the surrounding area is seen in this aerial view in Washington, D.C., Jan. 26, 2020. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP, FILE\n\nOverall the total number of cases that have been reviewed by AARO since its founding is now 1,652.\n\nAARO has \"discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology\" according to this year's report. A small number of this year's reports had terrestrial explanations and a significant number will be left for further review, but one thing they haven't found is that some of the reports are attributable to a \"breakthrough\" technology.\n\nHowever, during a press briefing Thursday, the head of AARO acknowledged that there are 21 reports over the last year and a half that he can't really explain.\n\n\"There are interesting cases that with my physics and engineering background and time in the I.C. I do not understand, and I don't know anybody else understands them,\" said Dr. Jon Kosloski, the new director of AARO. Kosloski said the 21 incidents occurred near national security sites and were recorded on video, had multiple eyewitnesses or were captured by other sensors.\n\nSo what do these unexplainable UAPs look like? \"Orbs, cylinders, triangles, in one of the cases, it has been happening over an extended period of time, and it is possible that there's multiple things happening\" Kosloski said, adding that the incidents might include drone activity that's being conflated with a UAP."

        "article_content": "iPhone users in some markets discovered a standalone Google Gemini app for iPhone a few days ago. The app wasn\u2019t available in most markets, as Google was apparently testing it ahead of a more widespread release. Fast-forward to Thursday, Google is ready to make the standalone Gemini app available to iPhone users around the world. The Gemini went up in the App Store quietly, and you can download it right now.\n\nThe Google Gemini app is now available as a separate app from the main Google app, where you might have accessed the Gemini AI on the iPhone in the past. The best part about the Gemini app is that it comes with support for Gemini Live, Google\u2019s version of ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode.\n\nIt\u2019s a conversational AI that lets you talk to the chatbot just like you\u2019re speaking to a human. You can interrupt the AI and change prompts on the fly, similar to how a conversation between two people would flow.\n\nGemini Live isn\u2019t available in the main Google app on the iPhone, so Google\u2019s new standalone Gemini app is the only way to get it on your iPhone.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nGoogle Live will support personalization, as you can choose from various voices and languages.\n\nGoogle Gemini app for iPhone is available in the App Store. Image source: Google via App Store\n\nYou can use Gemini Live to talk about anything, just as you would with ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode. Here\u2019s what the Gemini app description says Gemini can do for you on the iPhone:\n\nGo Live with Gemini to brainstorm ideas, simplify complex topics, and rehearse for important moments. Just click on the Gemini Live button in your Gemini app \u2013 Connect with your favorite Google apps like Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and more \u2013 Study smarter and explore any topic with interactive visuals and real-world examples \u2013 Unlock a world of expertise and get tailored information about any topic \u2013 Plan trips better and faster \u2013 Create AI-generated images in seconds \u2013 Get summaries, deep dives, and source links, all in one place \u2013 Brainstorm new ideas, or improve existing ones\n\nFor example, Gemini Live can be a study companion, ready to assist you while you learn.\n\nThe Gemini app for iPhone also supports image generation, just like ChatGPT does.\n\nMore interesting to me is the Gemini\u2019s app integration with other Google apps and services you might be using on iPhone. The description says the Gemini app will connect with your favorite Google apps once you install it.\n\nGemini can connect to YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, Calendar, and other apps straight from your chat. That\u2019s certainly a useful feature if you use Google apps on your iPhone and want to include Gemini in that. This sort of interaction goes beyond what ChatGPT can do, and it\u2019s all the more interesting as Google doesn\u2019t have any say in how iOS works.\n\nGoogle Gemini app for iPhone: Features and screenshots. Image source: Google via App Store\n\nAlso, Gemini isn\u2019t part of Apple Intelligence like ChatGPT will be. Even then, ChatGPT will not be able to connect to any other apps. Siri will handle such capabilities later down the road.\n\nGoogle Gemini is available as a free download from the App Store. If you want access to Google\u2019s latest Gemini models, you\u2019ll need a Gemini Advanced subscription priced at $19.99. You can test Gemini Advanced for free for a month before you decide to keep it."

Researchers used an improved scale to analyze responses from over 3,000 participants, revealing that traditional beliefs may reflect anxieties about external control.\n\nThe findings highlight the psychological differences between belief types but cannot confirm cause-and-effect relationships. Future research could explore how paranormal beliefs shape behaviors, such as attitudes toward alternative medicine and conspiracy theories.\n\nKey Facts:\n\nTraditional paranormal beliefs were associated with greater stress and reduced coping ability.\n\nNew age beliefs were not linked to stress or coping tendencies.\n\nThe study highlights the psychological impacts of external control perceptions in traditional beliefs.\n\nSource: PLOS\n\nIn a new study, feelings of distress and reduced ability to cope with stress were associated with traditional paranormal beliefs, but not with new age philosophy. Kenneth Drinkwater Ph.D. of Manchester Metropolitan University, U.K., and colleagues present these findings in the open-access journal PLOS ONE on November 13, 2024.\n\nPrior research has suggested that paranormal belief, in general, is not linked to poorer psychological wellbeing, but that certain facets of paranormal belief, such as superstition, may be linked with stress vulnerability.\n\nHowever, much of this research relies on a questionnaire known as the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, which has statistical issues that limit its usefulness.\n\nA different version, known as the Rasch purified Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, aims to improve on the earlier scale. To help deepen understanding of potential links between paranormal belief and stress, Drinkwater and colleagues had 3,084 people complete this scale alongside a questionnaire evaluating different facets of perceived stress.\n\nA key feature of the Rasch purified Revised Paranormal Belief Scale is that it differentiates between two dimensions of belief: first, traditional paranormal belief, which deals with cultural concepts of traditional religious belief and witchcraft, and second, new age philosophy, dealing with individual paranormal abilities known as psi, spiritualism, and precognition.\n\nAnalysis of the study participants\u2019 responses revealed that people who scored higher for traditional paranormal belief tended to show elevated distress and reduced feelings of being able to cope with stress.\n\nHowever, belief in new age philosophy was not statistically linked to any tendencies regarding distress or coping.\n\nThese findings are in line with the idea that traditional paranormal belief reflects anxiety about a lack of control over external forces that influence one\u2019s existence. However, the authors note that this study was exploratory and does not support any cause-effect relationship.\n\nMore research will be needed to clarify the relationship between paranormal belief and stress. The authors suggest that such research is important because paranormal belief can influence people\u2019s everyday behavior and attitudes, such as those regarding alternative medicine, antivaccination, and conspiracies.\n\nThe authors add: \u201cFindings support the notion that traditional paranormal belief is associated with external control, specifically the notion that unknown supernatural forces/powers influence existence.\n\n\u201cHowever, additional research is still needed if we are to further explore these fascinating relationships in connection to perceived stress, wellbeing and coping styles.\u201d\n\nAbout this neurotheology and stress research news\n\nAuthor: Hanna Abdallah\n\nSource: PLOS\n\nContact: Hanna Abdallah \u2013 PLOS\n\nImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n\n\u201cRe-evaluation of the relationship between paranormal belief and perceived stress using statistical modelling\u201d by Kenneth Drinkwater et al. PLOS ONE\n\nAbstract\n\nRe-evaluation of the relationship between paranormal belief and perceived stress using statistical modelling\n\nRecent research indicates that paranormal belief, in the absence of allied cognitive-perceptual and psychopathology-related factors, is not associated with negative wellbeing outcomes. However, investigators have historically reported relationships between specific facets of belief (e.g., superstition) and stress vulnerability.\n\nThese typically derive from the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS), which has questionable psychometric integrity. The main issue being that several RPBS items perform poorly.\n\nNoting this, the present paper re-examined the relationship between paranormal belief and stress using the Rasch purified version of the RPBS. This comprises two dimensions, called Traditional Paranormal Belief (TPB) and New Age Philosophy (NAP). These are operationalised in terms of function. Specifically, whether belief provides a sense of control at the social (TPB) or individual level (NAP).\n\nAccordingly, this study examined whether TPB and NAP were differentially predictive of levels of perceived stress. In this context, stress served as an indicator of well-being. A sample of 3084 participants (Mage = 50.31, SD = 15.20, range 18\u201391) completed the RPBS alongside the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10).\n\nConfirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling revealed that TPB was significantly predictive of higher Distress, and lower Coping. NAP was neither predictive of Distress nor Coping.\n\nThese findings support the notion that TPB is attendant with external control, particularly the notion that unknown supernatural forces/powers influence existence."

The coral measured 112 feet wide, 105 feet long and 18 feet high with a circumference of more than 600 feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Just when you think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" Enric Sala, National Geographic Explorer in Residence and founder of Pristine Seas, said in a statement.\n\n\"This is a significant scientific discovery, like finding the world's tallest tree. But there is cause for alarm. Despite its remote location, this coral is not safe from global warming and other human threats.\"\n\nCoral is a living organism made up of a complex network of coral polyps, tiny individual creatures. Coral reefs, however, are made up of many colonies of corals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists said the newly discovered coral is so large that it can be seen from space and looks more like a huge rock lurking just under the ocean. The discovery comes as concerns continue over dying coral reefs around the world because of climate change.\n\n\"The ocean provides for our livelihoods and has contributed so much to our national economy and communities,\" Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele, told National Geographic. \"Our survival depends on healthy coral reefs, so this exciting discovery underlines the importance of protecting and sustaining them for future generations.\""

The gadget is equipped with cameras to capture photos and videos and supports voice interactions powered by Ernie.\n\nThe company is not aiming to create a \"super app\" based on AI, Li said, signalling a divergence in strategy from other companies such as ByteDance, which has launched multiple standalone AI apps this year.\n\nBaidu also introduced Miaoda, which utilizes its LLM capabilities to generate code, allowing users to develop software applications without extensive coding expertise.\n\n(This story has been corrected to clarify that I-RAG is a text-to-image generation technology, not a standalone text-to-image generator, in the headline and paragraph 1)\n\n(Reporting by Liam Mo and Brenda Goh; Editing by Rashmi Aich)\n\nSponsored Bank Accounts"
