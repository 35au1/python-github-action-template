For the day that aliens reveal themselves may very well become the beginning of the end of life on Earth as we know it!\u201d\n\nA flying saucer crashes deep in the mountains of Japan. Wary of the hyper-intelligent beings they find inside, the government hides from the public all news of the alien craft. But it's not the strange visitors themselves that they should be afraid of\u2015the real danger is the parasitic spores smuggled aboard! Will Earth survive the UFO MUSHROOM INVASION ?!\n\nOriginally published in 1976, Shirakawa Marina's UFO MUSHROOM INVASION is a masterpiece of sci-fi horror. Drawing on his deep knowledge of Japanese folklore and the supernatural, Shirakawa created one of manga history's cult classics and an unforgettably creepy entry in the canon of spore-horror. With an essay by weirdologist Udagawa Takeo, UFO MUSHROOM INVASION is the second volume of SMUDGE, a line of vintage horror, occult, and dark fantasy manga, curated and translated by award-winning historian Ryan Holmberg .\n\nUFO Mushroom Invasion has a story and art by Marina Shirakawa , with English translation by Ryan Holmberg . This volume was lettered by Ozzy van Eschen and Sean Michael Robinson . Published by Living the Line (September 17, 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs It Worth Reading?\n\n2024 \u00a9 estate of Shirakawa Marina\n\nDo mushrooms make you uncomfortable? Is there something unpleasant about their odd shapes and strange, spongy texture? If the answer is yes, UFO Mushroom Invasion is the manga of your nightmares, because its plot involves alien fungi being brought to Earth in a flying saucer crash and taking over the world. People are colonized by the mushrooms, becoming human versions of insects infected by zombie fungus, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Even if mushrooms aren't the stuff of your nightmares, this is a genuinely unsettling book.\n\nIt's also an interestingly written one. The late Marina Shirakawa , who created manga during the 1970s and 80s, has a style that feels like a combination of Junji Ito , Kazuo Umezz, and Shigeru Mizuki , with creepy, stylized art and a penchant for breaking into folkloric tangents. The book combines traditional manga and illustrated story pages, with the latter covering the history of UFO sightings (primarily in Japan and the U.S.) and \u201cbizarre mushroom tales,\u201d which are retellings of various Japanese stories where mushrooms are the antagonists. It's odd but it does ultimately work, and I found myself enjoying the style mixing much more than anticipated \u2013 it creates an intimacy between author and reader that works to make the manga segments hit harder.\n\nThe science fiction/horror blend is in the classic vein of stories that predict that humans will become the authors of their own downfall. In this case, Professor White's greed to keep the information about an alien to himself allows the spores to spread; had he not silenced Aoki and Sado-sensei early on, the entire tragedy may have been at least partially preventable. But Shirakawa also leaves us room to wonder if maybe the mushrooms reclaiming the earth for nature isn't the best ending, anyway \u2013 it's an environmental message that makes a little bit of sense and one that you've probably seen before in the genre.\n\nAlongside the well-translated story, this also has an essay about Shirakawa's place in the mangaverse as well as a retrospective of some of his works, both of which are interesting and very readable. Fans of 1970s manga (this was published in 1976, set in 1978, which allowed his original readers to wonder if it could happen in two years) or horror shouldn't pass this by.\n\n2024 \u00a9 estate of Shirakawa Marina\n\nUFO Mushroom Invasion does exactly what it says on the tin. Mushrooms from a UFO invade. This isn't as daft as it sounds, and despite its age (it was originally published in 1976) and very dated art style, UFO Mushroom Invasion is genuinely unsettling and creepy. Author Marina Shirakawa intersperses his chapters with relevant factual titbits about biology and folklore that helps to build a sense of looming dread, of inescapable catastrophe.\n\nAoki and his teacher are mere ciphers, headstrong student and stoic teacher. We learn almost nothing about them, their function is to be generic everyman witnesses to extraordinary events. I can't help but compare the opening chapters to the cheesy 1950's movie version of The War of the Worlds , though we soon enter far darker, weirder territory.\n\nAnyone familiar with videogame/TV franchise The Last of Us will know how this goes \u2013 there's even a reference here to a Cordyceps-like fungus that controls its hosts, and the later appearance of fungal-infected zombie people, complete with mushrooms growing from their bodies.\n\nWhat's different about UFO Mushroom Invasion compared to its later equivalents is in its nilhilsm. Even The Last of Us contains a seed of hope for humanity, not so here. In one particularly powerful scene, Aoki is told by a mushroom-infected adult to give in to the fungal invaders, to surrender his body to the soil of the warm Earth. This is a dark fable, an early musing on the Dark Forest hypothesis recently popularised by Cixin Liu's Three Body Problem . If aliens really are out there, we don't want them to know about us, because the moment they do, all life on Earth will change (end)."

        "article_content": "The industry has been saying Apple is behind and asking when the iPhone maker would ever bring out AI \u2014 but the industry has always underestimated Apple.\n\nToday, toward the end of 2024, Apple Intelligence has still not yet been deployed. What frame of reference is there for postulating how important it is for \"first movers\" to rush out something ahead of Apple?\n\nThis all happened before\n\nAnalysts employed by Apple's competitors\u2014 and journalists looking for both sides of every issue \u2014 were both excited by the prospect of being able to report Apple being behind and unrepresented in what appears to be the latest, greatest technology.\n\nThat glee is also shared by Samsung influencers and the neckbeards praying for Google's Pixel to become relevant. Both makers \u2014 among other Android licensees\u2014 delivered some examples of generative AI on mobiles this year, before Apple had advertised any generative AI ambitions at all.\n\nOf course, as I wrote back in 2017, when Apple is two years behind you, get your things in order. In the article, I laid out how Apple had appeared to be behind every year in some respect across the last decade.\n\nIn 2007, it was in MP3 players \u2014 unlike iPod, Microsoft's new Zune could perform wireless sharing! That year Apple debuted iPhone, far beyond what the market was expecting. In 2008 Apple appeared to be a no-show in delivering a mobile app market\u2014 right before it took over and lead the category with the App Store, which has remained most important and commercially relevant mobile platform and apps marketplace ever since.\n\nIn 2009, Apple was supposedly never going to catch up to Blackberry in Enterprise instant messaging. That turnaround of fortunes was so dramatic they made a movie about it. It was an epitaph for Blackberry, nearly forgotten now that IM has been completely dominated by Apple in the United States where Blackberry was supposed to be the \"Crackberry\" of which the Enterprise couldn't get enough.\n\nIn 2010, Apple was the laggard in Push Notification Services (PNS) behind webOS, which similarly isn't around anymore. Today Apple clearly has the biggest PNS. In 2011 Google was pushing NFC and Google Wallet, which was \"first\" only in bragging rights once Apple belated launched its initiatives with Bluetooth 4, Continuity, and Apple Pay, a set of technologies far more advanced than tap, but also delivering working NFC payment taps that people actually used. Nobody else is even close.\n\nIn 2012 it was Samsung's plus-sized phones, eclipsed by the thermonuclear iPhone 6 that wasn't just big but also 64-bit fast; in 2013 it was Android Halo's \"modern UI\" that floated just before iOS 7; in 2014 it was Samsung's new and \"first\" wearables, eventually crushed by Apple Watch; and in 2015 it was \"detachable\" PC tablets like Microsoft Surface Pro, trounced by iPad Pro. I kept going if you want to read the whole article profiling every year of the last decade.\n\nSurely today, there was no possible way Apple could ever catch up to Microsoft's sweet (suite?) deal with OpenAI that got started back in 2019, right? Bueller?\n\nThis year, Microsoft beat Apple to the punch in rushing out Copilot PC, offering generative AI as tightly integrated into Windows PCs as Bob and Clippy were. Note that both of those are only in museums now, literally next to the Zune. They could add Windows 10 Mobile and the Surface.\n\nIn mobiles, both Samsung and Google, among other Android makers, have rushed generative AI mobile phones to market before Apple. Who could possibly guess where things are going?\n\nThe year of generative AI, sans Apple?\n\nAt the beginning of 2023 Microsoft committed another $10 billion into OpenAI, the year that in retrospect was broadly named \"the year of generative AI.\"\n\nThat spring, OpenAI released GPT-4. Generating content using that tool (and its peers) quickly became both widespread and concerning, as many students swapped out their writing education with simpler prompt engineering; as Hollywood executives threatened to use AI to replace writers and even actors with AI generated words and faces; and as social media exchanged active discussions about reality with passive likes of plausible fictions.\n\nWhere was Apple in 2023? It was certainly not on the generative AI bandwagon, pundits pointed out. There was apparently no generative Apple AI, outside of the broad use of Machine Learning (AI) that Apple had been baking into its iOS and macOS for many years for uses ranging from object recognition to computational photography to body movement tracking and fitness applications.\n\nSure, Apple had released its A11 Bionic chip in 2017 with the new Neural Engine. This neural network processor armed both iPhone 8 and Apple's next generation iPhone X with the hardware ability to perform accelerated, on-device ML. It was used most dramatically to deliver Face ID and Animoji features, but Apple's use of ML had been running broader and deeper than that.\n\nOutside of the Neural Engine, Apple Silicon was also performing ML within its GPU and image signal processor, the engine that handles advanced computational photography. That same year, Apple also released a new machine learning framework API for developers named Core ML, which enabled third parties to leverage a variety of AI/ML tasks using whatever ML-accelerated hardware features were available.\n\nApple wasn't performing the kind of generative AI that tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E were making famous in 2023, but it was deeply involved in delivering AI-powered features that were far less controversial.\n\nApple had been actively involved in AI/ML since 2017! It even laid the groundwork for Edge AI \u2014 performing AI on the device rather than uploading all tasks to the Cloud \u2014 through ever increasingly sophisticated and powerful versions of the Neural Engine. Microsoft and Qualcomm are belatedly racing to catch up with the baked-in ML horsepower of Apple Silicon.\n\nA18 delivers serious performance enhancements, including its Neural Engine\n\nRather than portraying the Pope wearing a puffy white Balenciaga he never wore, or cranking out a writing project so you didn't have to actually think about writing or form any new essential connections in your brain, Apple's ML used the same underlying technologies to deliver core features that were valuable to users and developers.\n\nEven before opening up CoreML to developers, Apple had used ML internally for years prior to perform face recognition for your photos, as well as face tracking and facial landmarks in Face ID and Camera. Apple also used ML in its graphics, in making Siri voices \"learn\" how to sound more natural, and to power relevant information in the new Siri WatchFace that debuted in watchOS 4, along with hosts of other tasks, from text prediction to fitness tracking.\n\nAdditionally, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi detailed that Apple would be using ML for privacy, noting that \"Safari uses machine learning to identify trackers, segregate the cross-site scripting data, put it away so now your privacy and your browsing history is your own.\"\n\nApple has been talking about privacy and machine intelligence for years\n\nIn a variety of ways, Apple was boldly leading in useful applications of AI/ML simply by nature of the fact that iOS was the indisputable leader in premium mobile phones. So why was Apple getting harangued by a lynch mob of pundits last year, six years deep into its active release and deployment of ML hardware and software?\n\nIt wasn't because you couldn't do generative AI on a Mac or an iPhone. Despite \u2014 or perhaps \"facilitated by\" \u2014 Microsoft's billions, OpenAI released a native client app for iOS last summer, simply by nature of the fact that iOS was the indisputable leader in premium mobile phones.\n\nOpenAI's press release for the iOS app noted at the time, \"PS: Android users, you're next! ChatGPT will be coming to your devices soon.\"\n\nWhere was Android?\n\nWhy wasn't Android sandbagged for trailing Apple's platform in the leading generative AI app throughout all of the Year of AI? Perhaps \"generative AI\" was wildly overblown as an imagined problem for Apple simply by nature of the fact that iOS was the indisputable leader in premium mobile phones.\n\nBy the end of Year of AI, there wasn't any difference in the availability of generative AI tools for Apple's platforms. But this year, Samsung's Galaxy S24 and Google's Pixel 8 scrambled to be first to deliver integrated, mobile generative AI features.\n\nWere users excited? It doesn't seem to have registered significantly in the market. More than an upgrade-compelling tentpole, their rollouts of generative AI brought some useful features that could just as well have been rolled into an app.\n\nFeatures like Samsung's Live Translation are impressive and useful, but not reason to buy a new Samsung phone. \"Circle to Search\" allows you to identify an item and ask Google what it is. That's not even generative AI, it's an app feature using the kind of object recognition technology Apple debuted back at WWDC 2017.\n\nPhoto editing AI such as Google's \"Magic Editor\" and Samsung's \"Generative Edit\" erase unwanted objects in photos and generate a plausible background. Apps have been doing that for a while now on iOS. None of these things are essential OS-level integration of AI/ML that give one reason to switch or upgrade to a new phone, are they?\n\nAnd given that the vast majority of Androids are serving as carrier friendly, good enough devices (in Samsung's nomenclature), there's no reason for Android makers to push the envelope in AI, generative or otherwise, because their mostly anemic processors can't do anything transformative anyway. They're targeted at affordability.\n\nHigh-end phones are a very slim slice of the Android pie, serving typically as gimmick showpieces with bragging rights to being \"the first\" at something, from the rounded-screen Edge to the Folds and the Flips that all only exist because Samsung makes displays and needs to show off what it can do. They aren't driving sales volumes. They're only turning up the hype volume.\n\nThe flip side of being a pioneer is getting arrows in your back. Google's generative Gemini created more eye-rolling than excitement when it became clear that the company was desperately trying to manage hallucinations by taking a beta-stab at guardrails with a high virtue-signaling-to-noise ratio.\n\nIf anything, it appears that \u2014 once again \u2014 \"being first\" is really just priming the market for Apple's introduction.\n\nApple Intelligence stands to be more than a chat bot\n\nRemember how Meta incessantly promoted Oculus VR for a decade, paving the way for Apple Vision Pro to really impress the high end with disposable cash to fund the development of the future of television?\n\nWhere was Microsoft?\n\nOne can give the mass-market phone makers a pass at not delivering super-useful new technologies while being laser-focused on serving the cheap end of the market. But what about Microsoft, which was hailed as a genius corporation for shoveling so many billions into OpenAI to embrace-and-extend the latest new thing to merely be another facet of its desktop PC monopoly diamond?\n\nI'm not going to rub Windows Phone in Microsoft's face here, but sticking to the desktop Windows, it's useful to note that the once-vaunted monopoly that Microsoft once ruled with an iron fist has been massively outpaced in sheer size by iOS. Redmond's ability to \"embrace, extend and extinguish\" has waned, as is clear from its total failure to launch Windows Phone leveraging its desktop. Oops I did it.\n\nWindows Phone 8 actually is in Seattle's museum\n\nReturning to AI/ML, it turns out, as I predicted, that Microsoft's Copilot PC wasn't mostly the glorious kernels of gold lauded by loyalists but was instead merely a turd featuring some unimpressive corn kernel cellulose.\n\nThis week, Salesforce's chief executive Marc Benioff complained in a Tweet: \"When you look at how Copilot has been delivered to customers, it's disappointing. It just doesn't work, and it doesn't deliver any level of accuracy.\"\n\nBenioff continued, \"Gartner says it's spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess. To add insult to injury, customers are then told to build their own custom LLMs. I have yet to find anyone who's had a transformational experience with Microsoft Copilot or the pursuit of training and retraining custom LLMs. Copilot is more like Clippy 2.0.\"\n\nNote that Benioff isn't one of those fearful critics of AI. In a podcast, he crowed, \"I've never been more excited about anything\" when asked about the future of AI. Asked specifically about Microsoft's Copilot, Benioff unsurprisingly touted SalesForce's own AgentForce as a tool to build and customize AI agents.\n\n\"I think Microsoft has done a tremendous disservice to not only our whole industry but all of the AI research that has been done... And customers are so confused based on this Microsoft narrative... I don't think Copilot will be around. I don't think customers will use it, and I think that we will see the transformation of enterprises with agents, and Agentforce will be the number one supplier.\"\n\nHardly an endorsement of Microsoft's efforts, and certainly from a rival, so put it in that perspective. But again, the market has spoken and it's not excitedly chat-botting about Copilot PCs.\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot PCs are like a Google Pixel: an expensive stab at delivering a high-end, premium-priced, Apple-quality product from a company that is really only known for achieving mass market sales via mediocre cheap hardware running broadly licensed, generic software the makes a lot of compromises to run everywhere.\n\nApple, on the other hand, is quite famous for delivering deeply integrated hardware and software that really excels at the tasks it was designed to do."

        "article_content": "The Fenton History Center is helping community members get into the Halloween spirit with two Halloween Spirit Tours set for Oct 26.\n\nThe tours are presented and run by Kaycee Colburn, a Fenton board member, artist, paranormal investigator and spiritual intuitive. Colburn comes from a background of working with the paranormal community, including at places such as the Dunkirk Lighthouse, other similar museums to the Fenton, and recreational locations such as the Haunted Hinsdale House.\n\nThe first tour will take place from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Fenton, 67 Washington Street. The cost for the first tour is $30 for members and $35 for non-members. The second tour is a special Halloween tour from 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. for adults 18 and up. The cost for the second tour is $40 for members and $45 for non-members. Additionally, guests are encouraged to come in costume for the second tour, which Colburn said helps to bring people into a different mindset.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring the paranormal vibe to the area, see if we can trigger any spirits and enhance the experience for the guests,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cWe don\u2019t say the Fenton is haunted, we leave that up to the guests and hope to give them a fun experience.\u201d\n\nColburn said the paranormal is something that is very popular these days and the tour can help give people insights into what they might see on television, along with allowing them to choose for themselves if the paranormal is or is not for them. She added that the tour is good for this time of year when the paranormal is already popular and people are looking for Halloween related things to do.\n\n\u201cPeople are already interested in the Fenton on its own and now they can come in the dark and see it in a different light, which gives a cool Halloween feeling,\u201d Colburn said.\n\nColburn encouraged participants to bring a flashlight, dress warmly, and be open minded, saying that there are a lot of theories surrounding the paranormal and that it is not for everyone. She said the tours are for people to come have fun and are very educational about the paranormal.\n\nThe Fenton has done other Spirit Tours throughout the year, and Colburn thought it was something that could possibly be done again next year after having received good responses this year to previous tours. She said some participants have requested the tours be longer or be overnight, which is something she said they are not currently able to do, but that overall there has been a positive response.\n\n\u201cIt gets people out of the house,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else quite like it locally.\u201d\n\nThe Spirit Tours are set to offer a safe Halloween, family friendly, fun event to let people learn more about the paranormal and spiritualist movement. Colburn said the tours are a way to bring information in and discuss the paranormal where in today\u2019s society that cannot always happen as it is labeled as creepy.\n\n\u201cThere was a time where the paranormal was not seen as creepy, including right here in Jamestown,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cSo being able to talk about it this way is cool.\u201d\n\nRegistration for both Oct 26 Spirit Tours is available on the Fenton History Center\u2019s website, fentonhistorycenter.org, under the events tab."

        "article_content": "This spooky season, which brings with it Fear the Spotlight\u2019s release as the first in a very cool slate out of Blumhouse, feels like quite a culmination of a tremendous year for horror video games. After sampling the game\u2019s horrific opening chapter back at Summer Game Fest, I was left wanting more. Fear the Spotlight really does feel like a tribute to so many of the classic games that paved the way for it, from its lo-fi, dithering graphics that leave enough doubt in your mind to jump at shadows, to its tactile, hands-on puzzle solving.\n\nFear the Spotlight, which is an expanded upon iteration of its release only a year ago, begins on a stormy night as Vivian, the player-character, and Amy break into Sunnyside High to perform a seance in the school\u2019s library. Quite predictably, things go haywire as the supernatural descends upon their night, leading to far more trouble than a simple breaking and entering should. Amy is found in a fugue state before she\u2019s drawn in by a powerful light, forcing Vivian to descend deeper into the belly of the school, which has cracked upon a portal to its past which, it seems, has plenty of skeletons in its closet to unearth after a fire decimated the campus in 1991.\n\nAlthough they spend relatively no screen time together, it is the burgeoning relationship of the two schoolgirl leads that drives events forward. While I won\u2019t divulge where the game goes, having seen where the original release rolled credits, I do think the direction of the expanded content is a genius move and undeniably builds out other characters within the game\u2019s lore while servicing the story at large. The entire game might only be four hours, however not one, singular second is wasted.\n\nUnlike Crow Country, another low-fi survival horror game that released this year, which gives its player the option to leave combat at the door entirely, Fear the Spotlight sensibly decided against turning Vivian into a super soldier who mows down ghosts and ghouls while trawling the locker bays. Although she\u2019s resourceful, she is young, in over her head, and she\u2019s absolutely terrified, which I think is evident through several of the design choices in the game\u2014particularly the one to not give Vivian any offensive firepower, whatsoever.\n\nThe character\u2019s fear and vulnerability is integral to not only the game\u2019s overarching themes, it also plays into the tense, hide and seek encounters with the fearsome titular antagonist, Spotlight. Leaving embers in his wake, he has sure but uncertain ties to the 1991 fire. He\u2019s a tall, slender figure with an ominous, oscillating light for a head, which strikes a horrifying picture whenever he shows unexpectedly, forcing you to sneak behind and underneath desks toward the nearest door. Seeing the ashen ghouls, who I presume are symbolic of the students lost, peering around corners and watching you is unsettling as it is, but Spotlight\u2019s sudden and heart-pounding appearances teeter at the periphery of being iconic.\n\nWhere other games might equip you with herbs or bandages to patch your cuts up with, Fear the Spotlight once again leans full bodied into Vivian\u2019s anxiety which can spike during these panicked chases. All it takes is a quick puff of her one-and-done inhalers with each hit serving as a calming cure-all for these moments of dread.\n\nShe\u2019s able to make use of her book smarts to solve several of the game\u2019s riddles which, in keeping with genre tropes, often involve scouring the immediate areas for key items before backtracking and piecing the whole picture together. I enjoyed all of the puzzles in Fear the Spotlight, even if they do lean ever-so-slightly towards being too simple, there\u2019s a satisfying flow that sees each problem Vivian faces snowball into the next, and it really helps keeping a great pace up.\n\nAs I mentioned in the opening, there\u2019s a wonderful, tactile feel to this game\u2019s world and its objects. You mightn\u2019t be able to thoroughly examine and turn items in-hand, however there\u2019s an interactivity to everything that kept me locked in throughout. Whether it\u2019s prying nails out of boarded windows, thumbing open the latch on a toolbox, or dialling in a phone number on a pay phone, you\u2019re charged with every input and it\u2019s a cool, albeit simple, touch.\n\nDespite an obvious, and deliberate, lack of fidelity due to the developer\u2019s pursuit of the in vogue retro, lo-fi aesthetic, everything still has a surprising amount of detail. Obviously it carries with it the warts of the style, with plenty of clipping and blocky textures, however it\u2019s one that lends itself so well to horror. The environment design is excellent, with the school itself getting extra credit for twisting its everyday halls into something dark and worthy of the tragedy that the school faculty swept under the rug. Darkness and shadow is used to great effect, as the dithering, the grain effect that helps cement the dated appearance Fear the Spotlight is shooting for, helps in creating optical illusions.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no real danger through so much of the game, you still second guess what the hard-to-see hallucination at the end of the hall could be. I also love that the game doesn\u2019t resort to jump scares to unsettle its audience, relying solely on a slow, steady build to keep the player on edge.\n\nUnlike some of its contemporaries, Sunnyside High\u2019s map isn\u2019t an open one. This creates a feeling of linearity throughout, which itself feels like a guiding hand showing the way. By solving small, self-contained zones one at a time, it minimises the laborious, time-consuming backtracking that often plagues games like this, but it certainly shines a spotlight, so to speak, on both the game\u2019s overall lack of difficulty and brevity.\n\nFear the Spotlight might only clock in at around four hours, but it\u2019s so well-paced and its puzzles, for the most part, feel as though they make sense in-world, which cements Sunnyside High, in my mind, as a horror spot that read the brief and passed with flying colours. It\u2019s staggering what a team of two has been able to achieve with Fear the Spotlight, it\u2019s a sublime survival-horror title that delivers in story and tone.\n\nAlong with being a tremendous first blow for Blumhouse\u2019s slate of smaller-scoped horror games, Fear the Spotlight could very well be my horror game of the year. I knew there was a reason I kept out of the library when I wasn\u2019t to school, nothing good ever comes of it."

        "article_content": "Nilpena Ediacara National Park in South Australia is well known for its collection of fossils from the Ediacaran period\u2014a geologic timespan that predates the Cambrian explosion.\n\nAn international team of researchers discovered a new specimen called Quaestio simpsonorum\u2014a pancake-shaped creature that represents on of the earliest examples of complex life on Earth.\n\nThis discovery provides more insight into how animals evolved from single-celled organisms and shows that there\u2019s more to be discovered at this world-famous fossil bed.\n\nAcross the vast expanse of Earth\u2019s 4.6-billion-year-long history, life has taken many forms. With the first microbes likely appearing a good billion years following the planet\u2019s initial formation, the history of life is filled with long periods of seemingly unchanging stability punctuated by moments of immense destruction or practically exponential growth. One of the best known examples of that latter phenomenon is the Cambrian Explosion\u2014the geologic period some 530 million years ago when Earth saw an immense uptick in the complexity of life in its oceans.\n\nHowever, complex life was well underway even before this \u201cexplosion,\u201d and nowhere can this be seen more clearly than at the 150,000-acre Nilpena Ediacara National Park in South Australia. Located on the western fringe of the Flinders Range\u2014the largest mountain range in the Australian state\u2014this national park (as its name suggests) contains the richest collection of fossil specimens from the Ediacaran period (a 96 million-year-long geologic span that follows the Cryogenian period and is known to some as \u201cSnowball Earth\u201d) and the aforementioned Cambrian period. Since this fossil bed\u2019s discovery in 1946, paleontologists have uncovered 40 species embedded in the rock of what was once an ancient seafloor.\n\nRelated Story A New Study Unravels a Major Microfossil Mystery\n\nNow, an international team of scientists lead by Scott Evans\u2014assistant professor of geology at Florida State University\u2014has uncovered what could be one of the earliest (and strangest) forms of animal life to date at the site. Called Quaestio simpsonorum (pronounced kways-tee-oh), this ancient marine animal likely lived around 555 million years ago, and looked like a flattened pancake with a question mark shape in the middle of its body.\n\nWhile that\u2019s puzzling in itself, the more shocking piece of this discovery is evidence that Q. simpsonorum could move on its own\u2014it would have shifted around sort of like a robotic vacuum cleaner, slowly hoovering up all kinds of microscopic algae and bacteria. The results of this study were published in the journal Evolution & Development .\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t other fossils from this time that have shown this type of organization so definitively,\u201d Evans, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. \u201cThis is especially interesting as this is also one of the first animals that was capable of moving on its own.\u201d\n\nAccording to the researchers, as Q. simpsonorum puttered around this ancient seafloor gobbling up microbes, it left behind an organic mat of nutrients, which they describe as a kind of slime. These left-behind trails became trace fossils, which the team also uncovered in its discovery of Q. simpsonorum.\n\nRelated Story Life Might\u2019ve Had a Pretty Electrifying Beginning\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the most exciting moments when excavating the bed where we found many Quaestio was when we flipped over a rock, brushed it off, and spotted what was obviously a trace fossil behind a Quaestio specimen\u2014a clear sign that the organism was motile; it could move,\u201d Harvard University\u2019s Ian Hughes, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement.\n\nThe importance of this discovery extends far beyond just one species that\u2019s been extinct for half a billion years. It gives researchers a glimpse at the gene expressions necessary to create these first forms of complex life, all while adding context to how complex life can form\u2014whether on Earth or some other planet.\n\nOf course, it also gives hope to experts who continue excavating the area that something else might be waiting to be discovered. \u201cWe\u2019re still finding new things every time we dig,\u201d Hughes said in a press statement. \u201cEven though these were some of the first animal ecosystems in the world, they were already very diverse. We see an explosion of life really early on in the history of animal evolution.\u201d"

(The other half went to Rosalyn S. Yalow, a medical physicist, for unrelated work.) Dr. Guillemin died in February.\n\nDr. Schally\u2019s discovery was a feat of industrial-style research. Because the brain contains only tiny amounts of hormone, Dr. Schally needed thousands of brains to obtain thimblefuls of the substance to study. A donation of one million pig brains from Oscar Mayer allowed him to put more money into building his scientific team."

        "article_content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 High Growth Software Stocks That Are Profitable In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) stands against the other high growth software stocks.\n\nThe Software Industry: An Analysis\n\nThe software market is experiencing robust growth, driven by various trends and technological advancements. According to Precedence Research, the global software market size reached $659.17 billion in 2023\u200b. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8% during 2024 \u2013 2034 to reach $2.24 trillion by \u200bthe end of the forecast period. In 2023, the North American region led the software market, holding a substantial share of 44%. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period.\n\nA key factor influencing the market is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI technologies are being integrated into software solutions to enhance efficiency and automate repetitive tasks. A study from Salesforce reveals that 85% of IT leaders expect AI to boost developer productivity over the next three years. This expectation underscores the growing recognition of AI\u2019s role in streamlining workflows and optimizing software performance.\n\nAnother significant trend is the shift towards cloud-based software. Companies are migrating from traditional on-premises solutions to cloud services due to their flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This transition allows businesses to access applications remotely and across various devices, which has become crucial in today\u2019s digital landscape.\n\nThe 2024 AlgoSec State of Network Security report highlights a notable shift towards multi-cloud environments. The research, based on surveys conducted in H2 of 2022 and 2023, evaluated major players like AWS and Microsoft Azure. It indicates that security, continuity, and compliance are key factors driving organizations to adopt cloud platforms. While cloud adoption is growing, Azure remains the most popular platform, with AWS rapidly gaining ground.\n\nThe report also reveals that the move to remote work has significantly boosted Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) deployment, dropping the percentage of organizations without SD-WAN from 55.2% in 2022 to 34% in 2023. Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) has become a popular solution for organizations by consolidating security functions into a unified cloud service. Additionally, firewall implementation has surged, with only 7.1% of respondents reporting no firewalls in 2023, down from 28.4% in 2022. This trend reflects a growing focus on securing cloud networks against external threats.\n\nWith an overview of the global software market in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024, we used stock screeners from Finviz and Yahoo Finance. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 50 largest software companies by market cap.\n\nTo narrow down our list to high-growth software stocks, we focused on companies with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in net revenue exceeding 18% over the past 5 years.\n\nNext, we focused on profitability. From this initial list of high-growth software stocks, we narrowed our choices to stocks that had positive trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income and stocks that have grown their net income positively over the past 5 years.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we consulted reputable sources such as SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into the net income CAGR and revenue CAGR over the past five years, and YCharts, which offered information on TTM net income.\n\nFinally, from this list of high-growth software stocks that met our criteria, we focused on the top 8 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 elite hedge funds. The 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024 are ranked below in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:FTNT)\n\nTTM Net Income: $1.31 Billion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 28.51%\n\n5-Year Revenue CAGR: 23.11%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nFortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) is a cybersecurity company that develops and sells software and network security solutions. The company\u2019s portfolio of more than 50 enterprise-grade products is the largest integrated offering available, delivering protection to networks, users, and data from continually evolving threats.\n\nThe company is actively pursuing its strategy to lead in the rapidly growing Unified SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) and Security Operations markets while also increasing its market share in Secure Networking. The company aims to differentiate itself as a SASE leader, being the only vendor recognized in multiple Gartner Magic Quadrant reports for both Single-Vendor SASE and various network security categories.

In August, Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) acquired Lacework, a cloud security and cloud-native application protection platform, which significantly broadens the company\u2019s security offerings and increases the company\u2019s total addressable market by $10 billion.

While we acknowledge the potential of FTNT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.
