        "article_content": "Have you ever heard of Grendizer and Spazer? Grendizer, also known as Goldorak, is a giant monster robot that connects and synchronizes with Spazer, a flying saucer that enables the robot to fly. FYI, the robot and flying saucer are characters in the 1970s Japanese manga and anime series UFO Robot Grendizer. How do I explain this to a watch audience not up to speed with Japanese animation? Think of Louis Abraham Breguet\u2019s world\u2019s first \u201csympathique clock\u201d first presented in 1798. It\u2019s a system consisting of a clock and a pocket watch. When putting the watch in the clock\u2019s cradle, it will automatically reset, adjust, and synchronize with the mother clock. Now you know how the robot and his flying saucer interact, but how did Grendizer end up on the dial of the Tissot PRX?\n\nThere are two possible answers to that question. The first is that it teamed up with Spazer, took off, and perfectly executed a precision landing on the dial of the 40mm watch. The second answer is a bit more lengthy but more realistic. To understand what Grendizer is, please check out the Wikipedia page on the anime series. That\u2019s what I did, and it made me decide not to dive too deep into the complicated world of Duke Fleed, King Vega, and the flying saucer Spazer. Instead, I will just focus on the watch, the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer ref. T137.407.11.041.02.\n\nTissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer \u2014 Who needs a 1970s glow-in-the-dark monster robot on a watch dial?\n\nI need to stop asking questions before answering them. So let me get back to the second possible answer to the previous question: Grendizer appears on the dial of a PRX because the decision-makers at Tissot think manga and anime are cool. The Swiss watch and the Japanese manga and animated TV series originated in the 1970s, creating a timeline-correct connection. The PRX is a retro-hip watch embraced by a large audience. A PRX with a manga robot on the dial appeals to anime fans. I perceive the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer as a clever brand extension constructed to win retro-futurism enthusiasts\u2019 hearts and minds. The Tissot marketing must have done extensive research on the target audience and how big it is.\n\nGrendizer comes with Spazer\n\nI am sure you don\u2019t want a summary of all the technical details of this Grendizer watch because, apart from the styling, it is a 40mm PRX Powermatic 80 model you have been reading about on Fratello for quite a while now. The manga-inspired PRX presents itself with Grendizer\u2019s Super-LumiNova-coated bust on the deep blue dial. The central seconds hand is modeled after the Harken weapon that Grendizer wields, and the robot\u2019s image is engraved on the rotor visible through the transparent case back.\n\nThe Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer landed on my desk, and that was some sort of miracle. Why? Because Grendizer did that without using Spazer. When you buy the watch, though, the box the watch comes in is shaped like Spazer. Maybe this is the coolest feature of the watch. Can the luminescent outline of Grendizer beat the hero\u2019s legendary spacecraft doubling as a box? Maybe not, but the PRX does have some very neat details.\n\nI already mentioned the central seconds hand with its weapon-like counterweight, but there\u2019s also a thematic engraving on the flange. If you angle the watch and look closely, you can read \u201cUFO\u30ed\u30dc \u30b0\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u201d (Y\u016bf\u014d Robo Gurendaiz\u0101), the original Japanese title of the manga series.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer\n\nThe agony of choice is a phenomenon that applies to Tissot\u2019s PRX collection. There are more than plenty of variations to choose from. The Grendizer broadens the collection while simultaneously being a niche product. What I appreciate about the manga-inspired watch is that it doesn\u2019t look too gimmicky. In the dark, the robot presents itself more prominently, but you will only discover his weapon turning around the dial once a minute after close observation. The same goes for the engraving on the flange and the rotor.\n\nThe standard steel versions of the 40mm PRX Powermatic 80 and the versions with the gradient \u201cChameleon\u201d models cost \u20ac775. The PRX UFO Robot Grendizer is a special edition, not a limited one, and costs \u20ac895. You pay extra for the additional lume on the dial and some other details, including Grendizer\u2019s Spazer doubling as a watch box. To be clear, putting the PRX in the box won\u2019t automatically reset, adjust, and synchronize with a mother clock because it\u2019s just a box. And since it is just a box, the watch will also not be able to fly like Grendizer could with Spazer. Anyway, if you, like me, are not into manga, paying \u20ac120 extra doesn\u2019t make much sense, although I do appreciate the execution of the Grendizer theme. So, Fratello-reading manga fans out there, what do you think of the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer? Let me know in the comments."

We're seeing that you know, people are struggling,\u201d said Roman Khaves the co-founder of Rizz. \u201cWhenever people are stuck in the middle of a conversation or don't know how to open up, they don't have the confidence to have these dating conversations.\"\n\nDating app fatigue, along with the struggle to continue a conversation led Khaves to find the solution in the Rizz app.\n\n\u201cAI wing woman, wing man,' Khaves said. \"That's with you 24/7.

        "article_content": "The increasing number of AI app downloads in India has caught the attention of companies like NVidia and Microsoft, leaving no stone unturned to cement their domination in this space.\n\nThe year 2024 has been witnessing a digital revolution as Artificial Intelligence (AI) apps have taken the world by storm. Developers are leaving no stone unturned to integrate advanced AI features into their apps, particularly targeting tech-savvy people worldwide. Interestingly, India, once again, emerged as the frontrunner in new technology adoption, leading the charge in AI app downloads.\n\nAccording to the latest report by Sensor Tower, the number of AI app downloads exceeded 2.2 billion worldwide between January and August 2024. This figure is projected to surpass 3.3 billion by the end of the year, with an impressive 26% YoY growth. The financial side is just as remarkable, with in-app purchase (IAP) revenue from AI apps topped $2 billion in the first eight months of 2024. This revenue is projected to climb to $3.3 billion by December, with a strong 51% YoY growth.\n\nGiven the global excitement surrounding artificial intelligence and its potential benefits, the jaw-dropping figures for AI app downloads and revenue are not really surprising. The launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI has also ignited a wave of AI app development as companies strive to capitalise on the growing interest among tech-savvy individuals. And guess which country has emerged as the biggest consumer of AI-powered content and tools? It\u2019s India!\n\nIndia\u2019s Dominance in AI App Downloads\n\nIndia has become the largest market for AI app downloads, accounting for a significant 21% of the global total in 2024. This translates to an astounding 462 million downloads, proving the nation\u2019s enthusiasm for AI-driven solutions. Following closely behind are Latin America with 20%, Europe with 15%, and Southeast Asia with 14% of total downloads, showing the global reach and appeal of AI apps.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to highlight that despite India\u2019s remarkable achievement in download numbers, it has not ranked among the top six revenue-generating countries for AI apps in 2024, so far. This paradox highlights an essential aspect of the Indian market: while the population is large and enthusiastic about technology, it is also notably extremely price-sensitive. Indias often seek free or low-cost solutions, limiting the revenue potential of AI applications in this region.\n\nIn stark contrast, North America, which accounted for only 11% of downloads, has emerged as the top revenue generator for AI apps globally during the first eight months of 2024. The region accounted for a whopping 47% of the global AI app revenue, amounting to $940 million. This financial success is largely attributed to a combination of higher spending power and a robust consumer willingness to invest in premium apps.\n\nEurope (21%), Latin America (8%), and China (6%) followed North America in revenue contributions between January and August 2024.\n\nWorld\u2019s Most Downloaded AI Apps 2024\n\nThe world\u2019s five most downloaded AI apps in 2024 are Chatgpt, Remini, Photoroom AI photo editor, Google Gemini and Doubao (ByteDance\u2019s AI smart assistant). What\u2019s noteworthy is that among the top 30 most downloaded AI apps globally, the majority are either chatbots or photo/video editors. This trend indicates a growing interest among users, particularly those under 50, in tools that enhance communication and creativity.\n\nAI Chatbots Take Center Stage\n\nAI chatbot apps, in particular, have experienced unprecedented growth over the past year. Global downloads surged over 14x YoY to nearly 600 million in 2023 and exceeded 630 million in just the first eight months of 2024.\n\nThe revenue generated by AI chatbot apps has also skyrocketed, increasing nearly 10x YoY in 2023 to $380 million. So far, in 2024, the AI chatbot IAP revenue has reached $580 million, largely driven by the popularity of ChatGPT, which continues to dominate the market.\n\nSpeaking of dominance, ChatGPT\u2019s monthly active users (MAU) have steadily risen, reaching over 190 million in August 2024, placing it ahead of all other AI apps globally. Notably, India ranks as the third market for ChatGPT by MAUs, representing 13.4% of its global user base. The top two markets \u2013 Europe and Latin America \u2013 accounted for 24.8% and 19.7% of global active users, respectively. This highlights not only the app\u2019s widespread appeal but also the competitive landscape in which it operates.\n\nFrom January to August 2024, ChatGPT generated $230 million in revenue, accounting for an impressive 39.7% of the total revenue in the AI chatbot market.\n\nInterestingly, the United States, despite having only 12.7% of ChatGPT\u2019s MAUs, emerged as its leading revenue generator, contributing a significant 42.4% to its global revenue so far this year.\n\nMeanwhile, European markets, including Germany, the UK, and France, collectively accounted for 29.7% of ChatGPT\u2019s total revenue in the first eight months of 2024. Japan and South Korea followed with 4.6% and 3.4% shares, respectively. India isn\u2019t among the top five revenue-generating countries for ChatGPT, even though the country has a large user base for this AI chatbot.\n\nTo better understand the demographics of ChatGPT\u2019s user base in the United States, we see that the 25-34 age group leads in usage, commanding a substantial 39% share, followed by 18-24-year-olds at 25%. Overall, a remarkable 64% of ChatGPT\u2019s user base is under the age of 35. Although this demographic data is specific to U.S. ChatGPT users, a similar trend emerges globally, as most tech professionals using chatbot apps tend to be under the age of 40.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that chatbot apps like ChatGPT are predominantly used by tech professionals, this raises an interesting question: what about the other segments of society? Specifically, those in the media and entertainment industries, or the many college students, especially females \u2013 are they also leveraging AI applications to enhance their creative processes or streamline their work? The answer is a resounding yes.\n\nAI Art Generators: A New Creative Frontier\n\nThe popularity and usage of AI image and video apps are soaring like never before. AI Art Generators apps have emerged as the top-grossing subgenre within the AI app market, revolutionizing the way users create and share visual content. Between January and August 2024, these innovative apps accounted for a whopping 53% of the total AI app market revenue, amounting to nearly $1.1 billion.\n\nAI Art Generators Apps like Remini and clay AI filters are particularly gaining traction among youngsters, generating millions in revenue. These apps are also strongly favoured by females eager to enhance the quality of their pictures and videos before sharing them on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok.\n\nIndia, boasting the highest number of social media users globally, accounted for 36% of the total downloads of AI Art Generator apps, while the US accounted for 43% of the total IAP revenue during the first eight months of 2024.\n\nThe Rise of Companion AI Apps: A New Kind of Relationship\n\nEven though AI chatbots and photo/video editing apps have been dominating the AI app market, another type of app is capturing the public\u2019s interest \u2013 companion AI apps. These apps offer personalized companionship and emotional support, catering to the growing desire for human-like interactions.\n\nLeading the charge is Character AI, which reached a historic high of 22 million MAU in August 2024, with nearly 19 million downloads recorded so far this year.\n\nInterestingly, the top three revenue-generating companion AI apps in 2024 are Replika, Character AI, and Talkie AI. Between January and August 2024, Replika generated over $9 million in IAP revenue, bringing its total global earnings to nearly $90 million.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly fascinating about companion AI apps is their high user engagement. Character AI users, for example, average 25 sessions per day, with each session lasting nearly 4 minutes. This translates to over 1.5 hours of daily usage, significantly surpassing the engagement levels of ChatGPT users. Other companion AI apps, such as Talkie AI, Linky AI, and HiWaifu, also boast impressive daily usage times of around or exceeding one hour.\n\nDoes this mean humans are feeling lonely and are turning to AI apps for companionship? It\u2019s a thought-provoking question.\n\nWhat\u2019s most surprising and concerning is that these companion AI apps are especially popular among younger users, with those aged 18-35 accounting for over 70% of the user base in the United States.\n\nCharacter AI, in particular, has a strong following among 18-24-year-olds, with 66% of its users falling within this age group.\n\nThis trend raises important discussions about social dynamics and the nature of human connections in an increasingly digital world. As people seek companionship in AI, it highlights a potential shift in how relationships are formed and maintained, prompting us to consider what this means for our social interactions and emotional well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the global AI app market is experiencing remarkable growth, driven by the increasing popularity of AI chatbots, photo/video editors, and companion AI apps. Predominantly embraced by tech-savvy young people worldwide, these innovations are reshaping how we interact with technology.\n\nAs AI technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more innovative and impactful AI apps shaping our digital future. However, it is also important to acknowledge the potential downsides of these advancements, as they may contribute to feelings of loneliness and disconnection among individuals."

This asteroid is categorized as a fragment of rock and metal that orbits the sun.\n\nThe project was led by Ay\u015fe Arslan, a science teacher at D\u00fczce BILSEM who has been engaged in space observation for five years, along with \u00d6mer Selim Esen, a 14-year-old ninth grade student at D\u00fczce Turgut \u00d6zal Anadolu High School. Their work was part of the \"Asteroid Discovery Campaign,\" supported by the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC).\n\nAs part of this initiative, amateur astronomers sought to identify new asteroids. Arslan and Esen successfully detected a celestial body in 2021, which was subsequently registered as a new asteroid by the IASC. This significant discovery also granted them the privilege of naming the asteroid.\n\nSignificance of discovery\n\nAy\u015fe Arslan shared her excitement with Anadolu Agency (AA), noting that after their application to the Asteroid Discovery Campaign was accepted, they began their observations using data sets provided to them. They utilized specialized software to analyze the data and submitted their reports to the Minor Planet Center of the IASC.\n\nAfter three years of awaiting confirmation, they received an email notifying them that the celestial body they discovered was the first asteroid identified by Turkish researchers. Arslan emphasized the scientific value of this discovery, stating, \"The identification of this asteroid marks the first time a celestial body has been discovered in the solar system by Turkish researchers, which is incredibly significant for both us and T\u00fcrkiye.\"\n\n\u00d6mer Selim Esen expressed his pride in their discovery, recalling, \"We discovered this asteroid three years ago. A long time has passed, but I still remember that moment vividly. It is very valuable to me.\" Driven by his curiosity about astronomy, Esen has been involved in various projects at BILSEM for seven years."

Discovery's Expedition Unknown\n\n8 Visitors stand in front of the treasury site in the ancient city of Petra. REUTERS/Alaa Al Sukhni\n\nIn 2003, two tombs were found below the left side of the monument on an expedition led by Dr. Pearce Paul Creasman and other archaeologists, leading to theories that they weren\u2019t the only ones.\n\n8 The Al Deir monastery in Petra, Jordan. Reynold Mainse/Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nCreasman, executive director of the American Center of Research, and his team used a remote sensing technique called ground-penetrating radar, which uses pulses to detect underground objects to see if the physical features on the left side, where the first two tombs were found, matched the features on the right.\n\nThey found strong similarities between the two sides, giving them the proof they needed to get permission from the government in Jordan to start digging.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got something,\u201d Creasman told Josh Gates, host of Discovery Channel\u2019s \u201cExpedition Unknown,\u201d according to CNN.\n\n8 People visit the ancient city of Petra, south of Amman, Jordan. REUTERS/Alaa Al Sukhni\n\n8 Researchers said that the finding might be the largest collection of human remains found in one place within Petra. Discovery's Expedition Unknown\n\nThey excavated the newly uncovered tomb in August with a film crew \u2014 but the most shocking discovery was what was inside it.\n\nMost tombs uncovered in the ancient city are either empty or disturbed, but this one was filled with complete skeletal remains and grave goods made from bronze, iron and ceramic.\n\nResearchers said that the finding might be the largest collection of human remains found in one place within Petra.\n\n8 Dr. Fares Braizat, Fadi Balawi, Josh Gates and Dr. Pearce Paul Creasman peer into the newly discovered tomb at Petra. Discovery's Expedition Unknown\n\nThe pair of tombs uncovered two decades ago by archaeologists from the Jordan Department of Antiquities had partial skeletal remains, although it\u2019s unclear how many were found because the data was not published, Creasman said.\n\n\u201cThis is a hugely rare discovery \u2014 in the two centuries that Petra has been investigated by archaeologists, nothing like this has been found before,\u201d Gates said. \u201cEven in front of one of the most famous buildings in the world \u2026 there are still huge discoveries to be made.\u201d\n\nAmong the well-preserved unearthed artifacts were several vessels \u2014 and one skeleton was found holding onto a ceramic chalice that resembled the mythical Holy Grail that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper.\n\n8 Archaeologists found a ceramic vessel resembling the Holy Grail. Discovery's Expedition Unknown\n\n\u201cIt really was this awesome moment of history imitating art,\u201d Gates said.\n\nThough the human remains were intact, they were more fragile than expected \u2014 some discovered with mold \u2014 potentially due to the humidity and seasonal floods, as well as the porous sandstone surrounding the tomb entrapping moisture, Creasman said.\n\nWith the burial intact, this gave the archaeologists rare insight into the Nabataeans, ancient Arabian nomads whose desert kingdom thrived during the 4th century BC to AD 106, Creasman explained.\n\n8 The monument is most well-known as the site of the mythical Holy Grail in the 1989 film \u201cIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\u201d Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\n\u201cWe were hopeful to find anything that might tell us more about the ancient people and place \u2014 human remains can be a really valuable tool in that regard,\u201d Creasman said. \u201cThe burials in this tomb are articulated, so the bones haven\u2019t been rummaged around and moved, so that\u2019s exceedingly rare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey must be hugely important people, because where they\u2019re buried is such prime real estate; it really is the main entrance to the city,\u201d Gates added. \u201cI think learning who they are is really going to help unlock part of the story of the Treasury.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Entering the final quarter of 2024, the fintech industry is showing signs of improvement compared to the funding decline of 2023. However, despite some recovery, the global fintech ecosystem is still far from its peak. Investment levels and deal volumes are still lower than in previous years. Notably, regions such as the UK and parts of the US have fared slightly better due to increased funding, but overall the industry continues to face significant challenges.\n\nDespite all this, the number of fintech startups continues to grow, especially in the US and EMEA regions. This growth has led to market saturation, and for any new fintech startup to succeed, it must offer something truly unique. Investors are becoming increasingly selective, focusing on profitability and scalability. This makes it critical for founders to take a strategic approach when launching their businesses.\n\nSo, what should founders focus on when building a successful fintech startup in today's world?\n\n5 Key Tips for Fintech Founders\n\nAs an experienced founder who has launched several fintech companies, I believe there are critical factors to consider for success in this evolving market.\n\nIdentify Real and Relevant Problems\n\nFocus on building a product that solves a real problem, rather than developing a fictitious solution. Founders must ensure that the problem they are solving has market relevance and that their solution is in line with current trends. It is important to understand your customers\u2019 pain points, resist the urge to develop a product just for the sake of riding the fintech wave. It can be done through communication with your clients, surveys, or market analysis.\n\nConducting market research, for example, will not only confirm the demand for the product, but also ensure that the solution is unique. Founders must constantly evaluate changes in the market and adjust their strategies accordingly to stay ahead. Try to find the gap that you can fill.\n\nAssess Niche Potential\n\nInstead of considering wide options, shift attention to the narrowness of your niche. However, it does not finish here. Founders must carefully evaluate whether their chosen niche has sufficient demand and revenue potential to support growth. Scalability is another key \u2014 while specialization is important, your solution must have the potential to expand beyond the initial market to ensure long-term success.\n\nSo, basically, start with a niche and then expand further.\n\nPrioritize UX\n\nUsers are already used to intuitive and aesthetically pleasing designs, they will definitely be turned away by a complicated and incomprehensible interface. It is important to incorporate UX considerations from the very beginning of product development. Make sure users will not need to spend their time understanding what button to press, and provide them with immediate access to all essential information from the app. A responsive support team, complemented by an integrated chatbot, will also significantly benefit user experience.\n\nAccurately Estimate Costs\n\nDevelopment and infrastructure costs are, in my experience, often underestimated. Be prepared for hidden costs and budget accordingly. If you fail to accurately estimate these expenses, it can lead to cash flow issues, project delays, and failure to meet operational needs. This can jeopardize the viability of a startup, hinder growth, and ultimately lead to business failure. You do not want to go bankrupt.\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n\nFrom GDPR to AML requirements, fintech companies need to ensure compliance with relevant regulations from the start. And, of course, founders should stay up to date with regulatory changes that could impact their business model. Otherwise, ignoring regulatory risks can lead to fines, potential litigation, or even the shutdown of a business.\n\nTo sum up\n\nYes, launching a fintech startup in 2024 is not an easy task, but when was starting a business easy, right? However, by considering all the necessary steps, the process will definitely be smoother. My experience shows that building a successful fintech company requires not only vision, but the ability to adapt to the rapidly changing market. For those who are prepared, the fintech sector can offer significant opportunities for innovation and growth."
