            "article_content": "GERARD JULIEN/Getty Images\n\nIf you've got a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscription, you're about to get a jumbo serving of AI in your Office apps. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook will all get a new Copilot button that opens a prompt pane where you can get help writing documents, analyzing spreadsheets, summarizing email messages, and building presentations. In addition, those subscriptions will get the AI-powered Microsoft Designer app, which can build images from prompts and edit unwanted objects from existing photos.\n\nThe new features, announced in a post on the Microsoft 365 blog, will be available as part of the latest Microsoft 365 update and come with a significant price increase. In exchange, subscribers will receive a monthly allotment of 60 AI credits that can be used with Copilot and Microsoft Designer across a variety of apps. The credits reset on the first of each month, regardless of when the subscription renews.\n\nAlso: 15 ways AI saved me time at work in 2024 - and how I plan to use it in 2025\n\nMicrosoft 365 Family subscribers will see a 30% price increase, from $10 to $13 per month. The cost of an annual subscription will go up to $130 from the current $100.\n\nWith a Microsoft 365 Personal subscription, you'll see an increase of nearly 43%, from $7 to $10 per month, with the annual rate going from $70 to $100.\n\nThe new prices will be effective at the next renewal period.\n\nThe global rollout of Microsoft 365 Copilot comes after several months of testing in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. Microsoft promised it would \"listen, learn, and improve\" based on feedback from customers in those countries.\n\nAt least one part of today's announcement appears to be a direct response to that feedback. \"[We] know there are times when AI assistance isn't desired (like in some academic scenarios), so we're adding settings in apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint that allow you to disable or enable Copilot as needed.\"\n\nThat link goes to a support article that instructs users on how to disable all connected experiences, which includes suggested replies in Outlook, the Microsoft Editor add-in, and the ability to dictate text. It's possible to hide the Copilot button from the ribbon on those apps, but it doesn't appear there will be a simple checkbox to enable or disable Copilot.\n\nAlso: How Microsoft's AI Copilot features could transform teamwork and projects\n\nAs in the test markets, customers with current Microsoft 365 subscriptions can opt out of the AI-enhanced versions (and keep the current pricing) by switching to a Personal Classic or Family Classic plan. New subscribers apparently will not be able to choose a Classic plan, and Microsoft cautions that those downgraded products are \"limited offers and may not always be offered as a plan option.\"\n\nEven after switching to a Classic plan, Microsoft notes, you might still have access to the AI-enhanced version; the plan change will take effect at renewal.\n\nFor Microsoft 365 Family subscriptions, the new features are available only for the subscription owner and can't be shared with others. Those users will either need their own subscription or will have to pay $20 a month for a Copilot Pro subscription.\n\nI've been following forums where subscribers in Australia, New Zealand, and other countries in the test market provided feedback to Microsoft. That feedback has been overwhelmingly negative, with plenty of customers vowing to cancel their Microsoft 365 subscriptions rather than accept the price increase.\n\nAlso: Microsoft Copilot vs. Copilot Pro: Is the subscription fee worth it?\n\nNo doubt someone in Redmond has put together a spreadsheet that predicts just how many of those subscribers are likely to follow through with their cancellations and how many will simply accept the price increase. Maybe they even had Copilot help them whip up an Excel formula to build that model.\n\nIf so, it might be smart to listen to Copilot's own warnings. \"While I strive to be reliable, I'm not perfect and can occasionally make mistakes,\" Copilot told me just now. \"It's always a good idea to double-check important information, especially if it impacts significant decisions or actions.\""

            "article_content": "Federal agencies with top-secret workloads can now use OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o through Microsoft\u2019s Azure for U.S. Government Top Secret cloud.\n\nMicrosoft announced Thursday it received authorization for 26 additional products in its top-secret cloud environment, meeting Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 503 standards and allowing agencies \u2014 particularly those in the intelligence community and Defense Department \u2014 to use them for the government\u2019s most classified information. Those added tools include Azure OpenAI Service \u2014 which provides Azure customers access to OpenAI\u2019s generative AI large language models \u2014 and Azure Machine Learning, among others.\n\nDouglas Phillips, Microsoft corporate vice president, wrote a blog post announcing the news that Azure OpenAI \u201callows agencies and authorized partners operating in Microsoft\u2019s Azure Government Top Secret cloud to benefit from multimodal generative AI models, such as GPT-4o, while meeting the rigorous security and compliance requirements necessary for the nation\u2019s most sensitive data. Authorized users can easily access and integrate Azure OpenAI Service and further ground it on their data for more specialized and accurate intelligence.\u201d\n\nGPT-4o is an OpenAI model that can be used for natural language understanding and processing, text summarization and classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, conversational agents and more. It is the foundational model that the popular commercial generative AI tool ChatGPT is built on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe announcement comes after Azure OpenAI received FedRAMP High authorization last August.\n\nLast May, William Chappell, Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer for strategic missions and technologies, told DefenseScoop that the company had deployed OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 to an isolated, air-gapped Azure Government Top Secret cloud for use by the Department of Defense for testing. However, the model wasn\u2019t accredited for wider use at the time. The accreditation announced Thursday would now make that possible.\n\nChappell told DefenseScoop the availability of GPT-4 in the top-secret environment would help DOD officials deal with vast amounts of data.\n\nIt\u2019s about \u201cmaking sure you have the right information at the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cSo whether it\u2019s geospatial or any amount of data, we\u2019re swimming in data, we\u2019ve got sensors everywhere. How do you actually make sense of the information that is within your organization? Whether that\u2019s proposals or all sorts of different types of paperwork that we all have to do \u2014 how do you simplify and how do you sort through that \u2026 data that\u2019s mission focused or data that\u2019s more back office and human resource-focused?\u201d"

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter.\n\nLooking to keep your content fresh and relevant in 2025?\n\nThis will help. Today, Pinterest has launched its second annual \u201cPinterest Palette\u201d report, which provides an overview of key color trends in the app, based on research conducted for its Pinterest Predicts trends listing.\n\nAs explained by Pinterest:\n\n\u201cThe Pinterest Palette offers marketers inspiration driven by what over half a billion Pinners are searching, saving, and shopping for each month. Our in-house creative and insights teams worked hand-in-hand to map Pinterest Predicts trends and color clusters against first-party platform Pin color data. Looking at actions like saves, we were able to see which colors are driving engagement over time.\u201d\n\nThe report identifies the colors most likely to resonate with audiences this year, which Pinterest\u2019s team has narrowed down to five key hues.\n\nEach color gets its own overview, which includes Pin examples, hex codes, and a listing of tags related to that shade.\n\nIt\u2019s a good-looking report, which likely means that Pinterest has got the colors right, and they do feel fresh and vibrant, even if a bit Christmas-y.\n\n\u201cBrands can tap into the colors shaping the year ahead for mood boards, product launches, or creative campaigns. For example, health-focused condiment brand Primal Kitchen referenced Pinterest Predicts and the Pinterest Palette for their Colorful Kitchen Tour last year. Fusing the 2024 Pinterest Palette with their core brand colors, Primal Kitchen launched new dipping sauces with Predicts-inspired \u201cKitschens\u201d pop-ups in three major cities.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one way that you can use this insight, while it might also give you the spark of inspiration you need to refresh your branding efforts for the year ahead, with trending color tones that align with your audience.\n\nOr you might go with something else entirely, and that might also align with your customers\u2019 interests. There are no prescriptive rules here, but it is worth checking out Pinterest\u2019s color trends, and considering what they might mean for your brand efforts in 2025.\n\nYou can download Pinterest\u2019s \u201c2025 Pinterest Palette\u201d report here."

            "article_content": "A review of personal exchanges and personal communications sheds new light on the collaboration between both researchers, which would lay the foundations for groundbreaking discoveries in particle physics\n\nSamuel Jarman, SciencePOD\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) made its groundbreaking discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012, but its ancestry can be traced back over 60 years to the first electron-positron collision experiment in Italy. Named Anello di Accumulazione (AdA), the experiment was the world\u2019s first collider of matter and antimatter.\n\nThrough new research published in +, Luisa Bonolis, a historian of physics from MPIWG in Berlin, together with particle physicists Franco Buccella from INFN Roma1 and Giulia Pancheri at INFN Frascati Laboratories, tell the little-known story how AdA\u2019s theoretical foundations were shaped by the collaboration between Bruno Touschek and Raoul Gatto: two pioneering physicists with a deep knowledge of the properties of fundamental particles.\n\nBuilt at Frascati in 1961, AdA was a ring-shaped collider around 1.3 metres in diameter, which operated until 1964. Despite its short lifetime, the experiment lay vital groundwork for ADONE: an electron-positron collider 105 metres in diameter, which would go on to operate until 1993.\n\nThis larger collider helped to refine the methods, which in 1974, would lead to the groundbreaking discovery of the J/psi meson. This particle was crucial in advancing our understanding of quarks and their interactions \u2013 ultimately paving the way for the discovery of the Higgs boson several decades later.\n\nTouschek is well known for his contributions to the AdA experiment, but less is known about the crucial role played by his friend, Gatto, who he met in Rome in 1953. In their paper, the team investigate the collaboration between the pair based on a wide range of available sources: including Gatto\u2019s personal exchanges with Touschek, and their own private communications with Gatto.\n\nThe team\u2019s findings highlight the close friendship between the two scientists, and paint a picture of the discussions between them which would prove the feasibility of collider rings as tools for probing the world of elementary particles.\n\nThe paper also explores the duo\u2019s friendship with Wolfgang Pauli and Gerhard L\u00fcders, whose theoretical work was a vital basis for AdA\u2019s success, and highlights Touschek and Gatto\u2019s contribution in mentoring many of the great Italian physicists whose work would shape the foundations of the Standard Model.\n\nReference\n\nL Bonolis, F Buccella, G Pancheri.

Savannah Olvera) VIEW ORIGINAL\n\nOn Jan. 8, the Army Training Information System (ATIS) team released the latest update to their Army Training Management Capability (ATMC) applications suite. The update includes the release of the ATIS Individual Training Record (ITR), the addition of special purpose weapons management to the existing ATIS Small Unit Leader Tool (SULT), and a number of minor improvements and bug fixes. The new updates are available to over 700 Soldiers from units that participated in last year\u2019s ATIS Software Preview 1 user research program.\n\nThe ATIS ITR is the highlight of this most recent software release. It provides individual users with a comprehensive view of training data across their Army careers and enables leaders to more easily manage training data for individual Soldiers assigned to their organizations. Individuals are able to view their fitness, weapons and task training data and assess progress over time, while leaders are able to better track performance trends for their subordinates and manage training data on an individual basis, separate from the rest of their organizations.\n\nATIS has also made improvements to the Small Unit Leader Tool in this release \u2014 the first being the addition of special purpose weapons data management. This enhancement allows leaders to record qualification data for secondary weapons, such as shotguns, grenade launchers, pistols and shoulder-fired missiles.\n\nThe second improvement is the direct result of feedback received from Army Reserve and Army National Guard Soldiers during Software Preview 1. Many leaders in those organizations expressed the need to see individual training data currency trends beyond the 90-day range originally available. ATIS\u2019 new capability release expands the available data ranges to 365 days. This expansion allows Reserve and Guard leaders to view the future state of their organizations\u2019 fitness, task and weapons data across timelines that are more applicable to their components\u2019 training cycles and planning horizons.\n\n\u201cThe release of the ATIS ITR, and improvements to the Small Unit Leader Tool, are examples of software development based on Soldier feedback,\u201d said Lt. Col. John Nikiforakis, ATIS product manager at U.S. Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Enterprise. \u201cDelivering software tools that Soldiers actually want to use is a guiding principle for my team. These applications are the first of many we'll release in coming months.\"\n\nATIS\u2019 latest software release represents a significant milestone for the ATIS team with the delivery of iterative improvements and new value to users, demonstrating the product office\u2019s ability to release new functionality while simultaneously incorporating user feedback to make improvements to existing ATIS applications. The ATIS team will keep delivering incremental capability releases in preparation for the ATIS Software Preview 2 program, which will see ATIS applications delivered to over 5,000 new users in spring 2025.\n\nATIS is part of PEO Enterprise\u2019s Army Data and Analytics Platforms portfolio."

China has been making agile policies that allow fast proof of concept, [as well as] failure and retry, which facilitates really quick iterations,\u201d said Ann Shi Yu, vice-president of autonomous driving company Pony.ai.\n\n\u201cThe competition in China is fiercer, which forces [companies] to progress,\u201d Shi said, noting that in the US only Alphabet-backed Waymo is capable of operating hundreds of fully autonomous robotaxis on public roads. In China, there is \u201cdefinitely more than one company doing that\u201d.\n\nPony.ai was operating around 250 robotaxis and roughly 190 robotrucks as of the end of 2024, according to Shi. Domestic rivals have also achieved a fleet size in the hundreds, including Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go which operates more than 400 robotaxis in Wuhan, Hubei province.\n\nThe panel discussion on AI at the Post\u2019s China Conference in Nansha on Wednesday. Photo: Nora Tam\n\nIn the field of robotics, UBTech\u2019s chief brand officer Michael Tam said that US competitors, including Tesla and OpenAI, \u201care a little bit advanced\u201d in terms of developing the \u201cbrain\u201d of robots, which is the artificial intelligence (AI) technology that controls a robot\u2019s sensors and movements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the recent rise of Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek, which trained its large language model with fewer resources but ended up with one that matched or even exceeded in certain areas the performance of larger US competitors such as OpenAI and Facebook parent Meta Platforms, proved that \u201cthere\u2019s not so much [of a] gap between the US and mainland China\u201d for AI, Tam said."

If you continue to have this issue please contact customerservice@slackinc.com.\n\n\n\nBack to Healio\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nThe algorithm analyzed motion in REM sleep and used five movement features to detect REM sleep behavior disorder.\n\nThose with iRBD had increased amount of shorter movements, duration vs. healthy controls.\n\nAn automated machine-learning method that analyzed sleep movements recorded with a conventional 2D camera may improve diagnosis of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, according to a study published in Annals of Neurology.\n\n\u201cIsolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is, in most cases, an early manifestation of synucleinopathy that affects 1% to 1.5% of the middle-aged and older populations,\u201d Emmanuel During, MD, associate professor of neurology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and colleagues wrote. \u201cThe neurophysiologic mechanism of RBD is motor disinhibition during REM sleep, causing repeated and brief movements of the extremities, head or trunk.\u201d\n\nNew research into AI-based analysis of sleep disorders found a machine model detected REM sleep disorder behavior with 91.9% accuracy. Image: Adobe Stock\n\nWhile the definitive diagnosis of iRBD requires in-laboratory video polysomnography, which can be both costly and challenging to interpret, a recent study used a 3D time-of-flight camera in a sleep laboratory with high accuracy, the researchers wrote.\n\nIn this study, During and colleagues sought to replicate and expand on those results utilizing a conventional 2D camera to monitor patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep difficulties and create a machine-learning analysis method, to replicate prior research attempted with a 3D lens in track sleep-related movements.\n\nTheir study featured 172 participants \u2014 81 with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls \u2014 evaluated between 2016 and 2022 at Stanford Sleep Center. The control group included 28 healthy sleepers and 63 individuals with other sleep disorders, who were matched to iRBD patients by age and sex.\n\nAll video-EEG polysomnography recordings were made with a 2D camera, shooting at 30 frames per second and were manually scored by two blinded sleep experts. A blinded sleep specialist also reviewed all recordings of iRBD patients to determine which individuals had visible movements in REM sleep.\n\nThe researchers then used an optical flow computer vision algorithm to analyze these recordings and extract features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility.\n\nAfter review, it was determined that the control group was comprised of 28 healthy individuals and 63 with a sleep disorder. Within the iRBD group, 11 individuals did not have visible movements during REM sleep.\n\nAccording to results, individuals with iRBD demonstrated an increased amount of movements (56.3 vs. 41.8 per hour; average movement duration, 3.4 vs. 4.2 seconds) and immobility periods, compared with controls.\n\nThe accuracy for distinguishing iRBD from other sleep disorders ranged from 84.9% to 87.2%, with the highest accuracy (91.9%) achieved when combining all five movement features and analyzing only short movements. Of 11 patients with iRBD without visible movements during REM sleep, seven were correctly identified.\n\n\u201cThis automated approach could be integrated into clinical workflow during the interpretation of sleep tests to enhance and facilitate diagnosis, and avoid missed diagnoses,\u201d During said in a related Mount Sinai press release. \u201cThis method could also be used to inform treatment decisions based on the severity of movements displayed during the sleep tests and, ultimately, help doctors personalize care plans for individual patients.\u201d\n\nReference:"

By signing, the US joins 120 countries working together to protect students, teachers, and schools from violent attacks.\n\nAttacks on schools occur in almost every armed conflict around the world. Each year, thousands of students and teachers are killed and injured, schools destroyed, and children denied the future only education brings.\n\nBy signing the declaration, countries promise to investigate and prosecute attacks that violate the laws of war, help victims, try to continue education during wartime, restore access after attacks, and protect schools from military use.\n\nIn the decade since the declaration was first launched, more than a dozen countries have revised their military guidance to ensure more protection for schools and education. Several have prosecuted people responsible for attacking schools. UN peacekeepers have stopped deploying in schools.\n\nUS policy already supports the declaration\u2019s key elements \u2013 for example, the US military includes schools in its official \u201cno strike\u201d lists, recognizing that schools not being used for military purposes are protected civilian property under the laws of war.\n\nSigning the declaration puts the US on the right side of a global movement its main military allies have already joined. Given its influence, the US move could help expand the group of countries putting their political muscle behind children and their education, encouraging allies, such as Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea to join. Signing better allows the US to use the declaration\u2019s guidance, written by military officers, to urge other countries to respect the laws of war, including when it trains other militaries. Protecting schools globally also protects the US\u2019 significant investments in international education before, during, and after conflict.\n\nThe US signing of the declaration couldn\u2019t be more timely or relevant. In the past year, almost every school in Gaza has been damaged or destroyed. Since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, more than 3,790 educational facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Countries that have not yet endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration should move quickly to do so, and show that schools, teachers, and students are off-limits in times of war."

            "article_content": "Satellite Images Capture Extensive Destruction in Gaza Strip from Israel-Hamas War\n\nInternational\n\n-Sathish Raman\n\nThe ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has left the Gaza Strip in ruins, with a ceasefire potentially on the horizon. Satellite imagery provides a glimpse into the devastation in this area, which remains largely inaccessible to journalists and others. These images reveal a possible buffer zone that Israel desires, despite global opposition, which would remove approximately 60 square kilometres from the enclave.\n\nGaza City, the densely populated urban centre of the strip, has been severely damaged. Buildings have been destroyed, and roads are now filled with debris. As the conflict continued, Israel instructed residents to relocate further south. This movement is evident in satellite images of Muwasi, located just north of the strip's southern border with Egypt. The sandy coastline and nearby farmland are now covered with thousands of tents, visible even from space.\n\nImpact on Palestinian Lives\n\nThe war has significantly altered the lives of Palestinians. The Gaza Strip spans about 360 square kilometres along the Mediterranean Sea. Palestinians hope this area will be part of a future state, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Satellite images have also aided relief agencies and experts in estimating the damage's extent.\n\nCorey Scher from City University of New York and Jamon Van Den Hoek from Oregon State University have been analysing Gaza since October 7, 2023. This was when Hamas entered Israel, resulting in 1,200 deaths and 250 hostages taken. Their recent assessment suggests that 59.8% of all buildings in Gaza have likely been damaged during the conflict.\n\nDamage Assessment\n\nThis estimate is slightly lower than a December report by the United Nations Satellite Center. It indicated that 69% of all structures in Gaza had sustained damage due to the fighting. Local health authorities report over 46,000 fatalities without distinguishing between civilians and militants. They note that women and children constitute more than half of those killed.\n\nSatellite images have been crucial for understanding how Palestinians' lives have changed amid the war. These visuals help illustrate the scale of destruction and displacement within Gaza. They also provide valuable data for humanitarian organisations working to assess needs and deliver aid effectively.\n\nThe situation remains dire as relief efforts continue amidst ongoing challenges. The international community watches closely as developments unfold, hoping for a resolution that brings peace to the region."

            "article_content": "US stocks wavered on Thursday, with the major indexes struggling to build on the previous day's surge amid another round of big bank earnings. Investors also watched the Capitol Hill confirmation hearing of President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) hovered just above the flatline while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.2% The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed.\n\nMarkets are coming off a major one-day rally on the heels of a surprise easing in consumer inflation that prompted questions about whether the pricing out of interest-rate cuts this year had gone too far. Stocks ripped higher on Wednesday on the back of the data and stellar earnings from major US lenders.\n\nTraders have now ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve lowers rates before July, reversing the pile-out that was sparked by the stronger-than-expected December jobs report.\n\nRetail sales for December grew by 0.4%, versus expectations of 0.6%. The monthly gain slowed from November\u2019s 0.7% increase. Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected to 217,000, versus the prior week's upwardly revised 203,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Bank of America (BAC) results showed fourth quarter profit more than doubled as the bank benefitted from a Wall Street dealmaking revival that has also boosted earnings at its rivals. Its shares were up slightly in early trading. Morgan Stanley's (MS) stock also rose after it posted a surge in quarterly profit before the bell.\n\nElsewhere in earnings, UnitedHealth's (UNH) fourth quarter revenue fell short of estimates, dented by weakness in its health insurance unit. The stock slid in early trading.\n\nAlso taking focus Thursday was the Senate Finance Committee hearing on Bessent's confirmation. Some of the topics touched upon during the meeting included tariffs, debt concerns and tax plans.\n\nLIVE\n\n18 updates"

            "article_content": "GRAND FORKS \u2013 Grand Forks has received a $3.2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce for road improvements for the Epitome Energy soybean crush plant project.\n\nThe announcement was made on Thursday. The funds will go toward improving roads like 70th Avenue North that to this point did not have a clear source of funding. The funds, through the Federal Economic Development Administration, stem from the major disaster declaration given to the 2023 December ice storm that affected eastern parts of the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt definitely lowers the burden on infrastructure cost on the city but also Epitome,\u201d Grand Forks Mayor Brandon Bochenski said. \u201cThere will be a cost share regardless, but this will help reduce the cost for everybody.\u201d\n\nThe grant has a local match of $798,342. The transportation improvements for the project always had a less clear path, according to City Administrator Todd Feland, as there wasn\u2019t a funding source directed at improvements in the way that were required for this project.\n\n\u201cThis really helps us invest in this prime transportation corridor,\u201d Feland said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a really great relationship with the EDA and (other) recent investments, like our UAS sector, are promoting economic development in the Grand Forks region.\u201d\n\nThe disaster declaration opened up funding opportunities for long-term economic recovery. This funding helps strengthen North Dakota's economy and industry, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration is committed to providing all communities with the resources they need to strengthen their local infrastructure,\u201d said Raimondo. \u201cThis EDA investment will bolster North Dakota\u2019s soybean processing industry, paving the way for additional private investments that will create jobs and build regional resilience for the future.\u201d\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer, R-North Dakota, echoed many of Raimondo\u2019s statements.\n\n\u201cNorth Dakota is an agriculture powerhouse, and our commodities rely on infrastructure networks to get our products to market,\u201d Cramer said in a statement. \u201cThis project adds value to the Grand Forks community, helping to improve the movement and processing of soybeans in the region, while boosting economic growth.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe proposed soybean crush facility would be located on 70th Avenue North on the far north side of Grand Forks. Epitome Energy CEO Dennis Egan has said that he expects sometime in 2025 to begin execution of the development agreement and the project. Accepting the grant award will be before the City Council likely at the end of the month."

UAP are real.\u201d\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies.\n\nWhile the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be.\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings in the UK (48 per cent) include photographic or video evidence.\n\nA quarter of all sightings (25 per cent) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17 per cent), \u201csphere\u201d, (10 per cent) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (nine per cent).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34).\n\nWhen it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters \u2013 which possibly explains the high sightings in nearby Lanarkshire.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSIGHTINGS ACROSS LANARKSHIRE\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 21/04/2021\n\nDescription: Object moving north to east and then changed back to a northerly direction then disappeared.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 22/04/2021\n\nDescription: Reflective ball-object moving oddly and hovering in the sky.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 16/05/2021\n\nDescription: Two lights travelling parallel at slow speed, before fading away behind a cloud.\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Orb\n\nDate spotted: 24/08/2021\n\nDescription: Light changed from white to red, moving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 25/08/2021\n\nDescription: Three objects moving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 27/09/2021\n\nDescription: Triangular beam of light like a search light moving at a steady rate, brighter at the top.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Disc\n\nDate spotted: 28/12/2021\n\nDescription: Three saucer shaped objects appearing stationary, in photograph, not seen with naked eye.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 11/02/2022\n\nDescription: Three stars in a straight line formation, moving very fast from west to east then fading from view.\n\nAirdrie\n\nShape of UFO: Cylinder\n\nDate spotted: 27/06/2022\n\nDescription: Object \u2018like a plane with no wings\u2019 flying high up with no vapour trail.\n\nUddingston\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 17/11/2023\n\nDescription: Orange light appeared to be making a tear in the sky.

            "article_content": "\u201cL\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi\u201d is a phrase attributed to French king Louis XIV, the Sun King, though it is considered by historians to be apocryphal: meaning \u201cI am the state,\u201d it speaks to the king\u2019s absolute and divinely ordained power. Three kings ruled from the Palace of Versailles: Louis XIV until his death in 1715, then Louis XV from 1722 until 1774 and finally, Louis XVI until the Revolution of 1789. Louis XV was among the best-educated royals of his age, and his knowledge was of a mostly scientific nature. From the age of seven, he was passionate about cartography, and at age eleven, he discovered astronomy. \u201cIn addition to his core education, he touched upon anatomy and surgery, and from medicine, he went on to study botany. He read a great deal, assiduously consulted the maps in his geography gallery, attended dissections, studied plants at Trianon [a smaller building at Versailles] and observed the heavens, following every astronomical event,\u201d writes French art historian Beatrix Saule in the book that accompanies the London Science Museum\u2019s exhibition, \u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour.\u201d While Versailles and its kings have always been regarded as sumptuous and somewhat decadent against a backdrop of the then-starving French peasantry, the scientific pursuits of the kings are not at the top of public consciousness. Until, that is, this show was put together.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

I was surprised, therefore, that the revolution was mentioned only briefly in this exhibition: while it is written on plaques that scientific instruments were destroyed or stolen during the riots, it is not explained at length, nor is it explained fully as to whether the republic that followed adopted the scientific discoveries of their forebears. This, I feel, is a glaring omission, and one that will leave visitors wanting to know more: while the exhibition book mentions that \u201cdocuments and scientific instruments were scattered at the time of the revolutionary sales in 1793-94, when Versailles was emptied of all its furnishings\u201d and that objects were taken to various institutions, it does not feel thorough. True, the exhibition is entitled \u201cVersailles\u201d rather than \u201cFrance: Science and Splendour,\u201d but more background wouldn\u2019t be out of place.\n\nThe star of the show is Louis XV\u2019s rhino. The male Indian rhinoceros presented to Louis XV in 1769 by Jean-Baptiste Chevalier de Conan, the governor of Chandernagore (now Chandannagar) in Bengal, has pride of place in the exhibition\u2019s main room. The plaque reads that he was killed during the revolution, possibly drowning in the fountains or after being stabbed with a sword. While he lived, the rhinoceros was among thousands of animals from Europe, Asia, Africa and America in the royal menagerie. They were a source of inspiration for many artists, such as the Flemish animal painter Pieter Boel, whose studies included a painting of one of the rarest birds in the menagerie, the cassowary, sent to Versailles in 1671 from Madagascar.\n\nThe other star of the show is the Clock of the Creation of the World (the Pendule de la Cr\u00e9ation du monde). At the time of its manufacture\u20141754\u2014clocks were considered to be the most sophisticated and most prestigious devices ever made. Its design and mechanisms are a spectacle to behold: at the top, a shining sun banishes the darkness, which is represented in the form of clouds. It really is marvelous to look at: like jewelry, it gleams brilliantly in the light, and the meteorological forms are very stunningly depicted. \u201cIn the lower part, held in a patinated bronze rock surrounded by raging waves, sits a terrestrial globe engraved with the different countries. This globe rotates on its axis in 24 hours, and the inclination of the poles varies according to the seasons. A long ray of sun indicates midday in the countries situated on the same latitude,\u201d the exhibition book explains further.\n\nA portrait of Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet (1706\u20131749) is also included in the exhibition\u2014she who was deemed by her lover Voltaire to be \u201ca great man whose only fault was being a woman.\u201d While living with and supporting the writer financially, she accumulated a very large library, carried out scientific experiments and wrote a great number of books. One of the first to appear, in 1738, was El\u00e9mens de la philosophie de Neuton (translated colloquially, A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Newtonianism), which was thought to be by Voltaire but was, in fact, a collaborative effort. In addition to her literal translation of Newton\u2019s prose, du Ch\u00e2telet provided more accessible explanations of his arguments with clear examples: \u201cShe transformed his geometrical expositions into modern calculus, and also summarised the latest mathematical research and experimental vindications of his theories,\u201d says Versailles: Science and Splendour. I would have liked to have some space dedicated to the position of women in France at the time. Of the scientific community, how many were women? What level of education could a middle- or working-class woman attain? Sadly, this wider context is missing.\n\nThe construction of the magnificent fountains at Versailles, which still function gloriously today, is given space. The plans for the mechanisms and piping that would deliver the requisite 9,500 cubic meters of water , composed by \u201csavants and engineers,\u201d along with the taxidermied rhinoceros and the Clock of the Creation of the World, really give the exhibition its splendor. That said, if I had the chance to curate such a show, I would dedicate one of the galleries to a reproduction of a palace room of Versailles, complete with paneled walls, gilding and paintings. The objects in the exhibition, though fascinating, are rendered a little clinical in their austere Science Museum settings. Nevertheless, the show is a tremendous feat and sure to spark curiosity in those who make the time to visit.\n\n\u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour\u201d is at London\u2019s Science Museum through April 21, 2025."

            "article_content": "The truism \u201cThe personal is political\u201d has never seemed more apt than in the new movie \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d Brazil\u2019s Oscar submission for best international feature, it centers on the real-life Eunice Paiva (Fernanda Torres), a mother of five. Her husband, Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), a former congressman exiled for a time, was \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the reigning military dictatorship in 1971. The film is both a powerful portrait of a displaced family and, inevitably, a drama of a country under siege.\n\nThe director, Walter Salles, who grew up in Rio de Janeiro as a friend of the middle-class Paiva family, has described the movie as \u201cboth the story of how to live through loss and a mirror of the wound left on a nation.\u201d Because virtually all of the action is filmed from the perspective of Eunice, the result is doubly bracing. We are caught up in a political maelstrom, and yet the effect is startlingly intimate. The Paiva family members may be representative of the many Brazilians who suffered during the two decades of dictatorship, but we are never made to feel that they are merely generic. Their plight and their fortitude are too real for that.\n\nThe film opens on a deceptively convivial note. The Paiva children, including Vera (played as a young woman by Valentina Herszage) and Marcelo (played as a boy by Guilherme Silveira), are gamboling on a sunny beach, playing volleyball, and chasing a stray puppy. When they return to the sprawling family home, the festive vibe endures. Eunice clearly enjoys being the harried matriarch. Rubens relishes his role as a put-upon papa. (He grudgingly allows Marcelo to keep the puppy.)\n\nWhy We Wrote This \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d is a movie about remembrance \u2013 of a family and a nation, our critic writes of the drama based on real events. \u201cThe necessity to acknowledge injustice is its timeless clarion call.\u201d\n\nThe good times, of course, are fleeting. Vera, who is planning to study in London, is detained at a military roadblock with her partying friends. She is released, but the note of impending doom is sounded. Rubens is soon visited at home by military authorities and carted off. Eunice and another daughter, Eliana (Marjorie Estiano), are likewise brought in for questioning, and briefly locked up.\n\nEunice is never told what has happened to her husband. His disappearance frames the remainder of the film, which ultimately spans four decades. She learns that, without her knowledge, he had secretly been aiding dissidents. Despite this revelation, she holds no rancor toward Rubens because it\u2019s clear she would expect nothing less from him. In her own way, she is as much a champion of justice as he is. Realizing that he may never be seen again, she nevertheless fights for his return while struggling to keep her family intact.\n\nWith everything this film has going for it, it might still not have hit home but for Torres\u2019 shattering performance. Salles and his screenwriters, Murilo Hauser and Heitor Lorega, drew on a 2015 memoir by the grown-up Marcelo Paiva. Clearly they see Eunice as a force of nature. But Torres does something quite daring: She humanizes Eunice without once relying on obvious emotional cues. There are no scenes of her sobbing or breaking apart in rage. She knows that the happiness of her brood, which she values above all else, also represents the ultimate rebuke to the dictatorship.\n\nAs shown in the film, Eunice Paiva became a lawyer in midlife and a renowned defender of human rights. We see her at the end of that life, her mind clouded, at a joyous family gathering. She is played in this brief scene by Torres\u2019 mother, the legendary actor Fernanda Montenegro.\n\nDeepen your worldview\n\nwith Monitor Highlights.

It\u2019s as if this real-life mother and daughter are in communion with each other. \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d is a movie about remembrance \u2013 of a family and a nation. The necessity to acknowledge injustice is its timeless clarion call.\n\nPeter Rainer is the Monitor\u2019s film critic. \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d is rated PG-13 for thematic content, some strong language, drug use, smoking, and brief nudity. The film is in Portuguese with English subtitles."
