            "article_content": "On the night of August 10, 2022, five pilots on two separate commercial airline flights were wholly convinced they\u2019d documented proof of an Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP) over the Pacific Ocean. Pilots from both flights reported seeing odd lights zipping through the sky\u2014but the single incident they all witnessed turned out to be Starlink telecommunications satellites.\n\nIn recent years, pilots\u2014as well as the public\u2014have mistakenly identified these low-Earth orbit satellites as UAPs. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of 69 reports just from January 23\u2013April 27, 2023 that identify \u201cUFO-UAP,\u201d and according to one paper , more than a third of them could be Starlink satellites. Unfortunately, such mysterious sightings lead to pilot confusion and potential safety consequences because of the distraction and extra chatter about them over the airwaves.\n\nThe core issue with pilots misidentifying satellites as UAPs stems from the fact that pilots cannot access real-time data about satellite movements, leaving them unprepared to recognize strange lights in the sky. These satellites may appear to move in unexpected ways, based on their orientation, and they may also appear and disappear, since their solar arrays reflect sunlight at different angles when deployed, relative to the pilot\u2019s position in flight.\n\nStarlink satellites orbit about 342 miles above Earth, according to Starlink\u2019s website, and that places them lower than most other satellites, making them visible to our eyes as spots of light, no magnification needed. More than 6,000 Starlink satellites are currently circling Earth, and the SpaceX-owned company aims to eventually have 42,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit, which means pilots will need to have surefire methods for identifying them.\n\n\n\nGetty Images The passage of Starlink satellites is seen in the sky over southern Poland on November 1, 2024.\n\nFour scientists want to fill the information gap in this type of situation to prevent unnecessary aviation risk. Led by mechanical engineer Douglas J. Buettner of the University of Utah, the team devised a method to simulate the exact locations of satellites, and they proposed plans that would provide pilots with the information they need to quickly identify satellites. Their paper describing this work was accepted at the 2024 International Academy of Astronautics Conference on Space Situational Awareness (ICSSA).\n\nTo shed some light on what the five pilots saw, the scientists conducted an \u201castrometric analysis\u201d of their reports, using two cell phone photos and a video the pilots had taken of \u201can unrecognized and possibly anomalous phenomenon,\u201d according to the paper. To corroborate the data, researchers looked up Starlink\u2019s records, noting that the visual line the satellites created in the sky\u2014called a \u201ctrain\u201d of satellites\u2014launched that same day. The team also used data from the flight, including photographs taken in the cockpit. Using these pieces of information and an orbital mechanics software tool, they were able to reconstruct the August 10 cockpit view. It showed Starlink satellites matching both the time and place of the sighting.\n\nTheir analysis used a technique called \u201cray-traced rendering\u201d of the view from the pilots\u2019 cockpit, which provided a more visual simulation of exactly where the pilots saw the satellites through their cockpit windows, according to the paper. The simulation experiments indicated that the satellites\u2019 solar arrays must have been deployed, likely making them glint brightly enough for the pilots in both aircraft to notice them. \u201cIn the implementation of our approach, we were able to closely match the apparent speed in degrees per second traveled by the object between the two photographs taken by one of the pilots,\u201d the scientists wrote.\n\nThe team hopes that their work demonstrates a plan that could plausibly \u201cwarn aviators and the public about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations,\u201d and therefore support aviation safety, they wrote. In the future, it\u2019s worth studying how the deployment of a satellite\u2014as well as its surface materials\u2014affects the way it reflects sunlight, the paper adds. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said on X that the satellite orientation could be adjusted to minimize solar reflection during astronomical experiments, though the team\u2019s paper does not specifically address this possibility.\n\nThe authors do suggest various procedures and technologies that aircraft could deploy to support accurate UAP identification. For example, pilots should be allowed to \u201croutinely provide photographic evidence from either an automated system when they are busy with safety critical aircraft operations, or using cell phones when they are not allowed,\u201d to greatly improve UAP analysis.\n\nSatellite operators should also provide information about satellite movements\u2014such as orientation, orbit location, and deployment timelines\u2014to support more accurate and detailed models, the scientists write. Finally, they suggest a way for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reduce in-flight risks due to pilots trying to determine the source of a UAP. Air traffic controllers could have access to a satellite-modeling system that would enable them to anticipate satellite sightings and alert the pilots when necessary. \u201cWe envision this as a collaborative effort between the satellite\u2019s owners (in this case SpaceX/Starlink), the FAA, NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Space Force,\u201d the authors note.\n\nAs for people on the ground, anyone can find Starlink in the sky. Look up on a clear, dark night, and if you see a white light or \u201ctrain\u201d of lights moving across the sky, go to FindStarlink.com. You can search for your time and location and determine if what you see is indeed Starlink satellites."

While the prison remains open to tourism, the most exciting moment of the year is certainly when the fest rolls into town for a long weekend of rock and metal.\n\nFans are already looking forward to the 2025 installment, which takes place July 18, 29 and 20. The lineup, meanwhile, has yet to be announced, creating even more anticipation.\n\nInkcarceration is one of many of Danny Wimmer Presents' premiere festivals. Since it's formation in 2011, DWP has become a leading promoter in heavy music and beyond, building up the U.S. festival circuit that dominates the spring, summer and fall months.\n\nThe DWP festival roster also includes Aftershock, Born & Raised, Bourbon & Beyond, Golden Sky Country Music Festival, Louder Than Life, Rocklahoma, Sonic Temple and Welcome to Rockville.\n\nVisit the Inkcarceration and DWP websites for more information."

I was sure that Lockport was rich and full of history, so we did some research and talked to some people and we've done quite a few places,\" Sanders said.\n\nSo far Sander's visited such spots like Marjim Manor, Van Horn Mansion, Cold Springs Cemetery, Dunkirk Lighthouse and Stooges, the old City Hall.\n\nSanders said he has plans to visit even more ghostly sites, including Graestone Manor in Gasport.\n\nWhile the ghosts in Lockport seem more \"intrigued\" by him than \"aggressive\" Sanders said that was fine with him. He's still testing new ground in the world of the paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Some of these places I've done have never been investigated by anybody before. I think they're more intrigued here than aggressive, unlike the places I've been on the West Coast. Those are used to tourism because some of those places out west are mainstream ghost hunting places. Here in Lockport that's not the case,\" he said.\n\nSanders began his own ghost hunting with a curiosity of what's unknown \u2014 the big questions like \"what happens when we die?\" \u2014 as well as a drive to find out for himself. There's millions of ghost hunting shows out there, Sanders said. He wanted to see if it was real.\n\nUsing a wide variety of tools, including \"spirit dice,\" as well as white noise boxes and light-up \"rem pods\" that he buys online, Sanders said that depending on the intelligence of the ghost he's trying to communicate with, different kinds of equipment are used.\n\n\"You usually run into a residual haunting or an intelligent haunting and typically an intelligent haunting can give you intelligent conversation through some of the equipment,\" he said. \"A residual haunting is supposedly a spirit that's almost stuck in a time loop and the spirit is not able to communicate, but we are able to pick up the presence of spirit.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, to even get close to the ghosts, Sanders said he has to get permission. Which can be a strange thing to ask. Such was the case of the old City Hall, now Stooges restaurant.\n\n\"I walked through the front door and I could feel the sensation of some sort of activity there and I walked up to the girls who were working at the front counter \u2014 and sometimes its a very awkward question to ask about the paranormal \u2014but I asked them. I said, 'I have an odd question for you, is this place haunted?' They all started laughing,\" he said.\n\nAs it turns out, after investigating, there was no \"concrete evidence\" of intelligence hauntings in Stooges, but Sanders was able to get evidence of \"something\" in the attic.\n\n\"We set a device upstairs in the attic, in which most of the activity, from the employees and the people that have been in there eating have said they heard. That was the only place I was able to get any concrete evidence of something up there,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther places were a little more spooky, including the house in Cold Springs Cemetery. There, Sanders was unable to get responses, but one of his friends, a camera woman named Jen Craft, was able to get answers from children that were haunting the second floor.\n\n\"She was getting intelligent responses through the devices we were using, confirming there were children upstairs in the Cold Springs Cemetery house,\" Sanders said.\n\nSanders said he intends to stay in the area until May and he and his friends will be checking out everything \"haunted\" in the meantime.\n\n\"I will be discussing with the group on dates, holidays and when they're off (for more ghost hunting trips),\" he said."

A new study published in the journal Science describes how anthropogenic air pollution impacts the process of the formation of ice from supercooled cloud water droplets, which impacts our climate.\n\n\"There was an 8% reduction in cloud cover and an 18% reduction in cloud optical thickness,\" according to the study. \"Additionally, daily glaciation-induced snowfall accumulations reached 15 millimeters. Glaciation events downwind of industrial aerosol hot spots indicate that anthropogenic aerosols likely serve as ice-nucleating particles.\"\n\nDo you worry about air pollution in your town?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nResearchers studied cloud formations near 67 major industrial sites around the world. They discovered that pollution particles trigger ice formation, leading to snowfall that creates noticeable gaps or holes in cloud cover.\n\nWhy are air pollution's effects on cloud formation important?\n\n\"The findings indicate that industrial aerosols facilitate the formation of ice within clouds rather than just liquid droplets,\" according to the One Green Planet report. \"This ice formation not only contributes to localized snowfall but also affects the physical properties of clouds. Ice-laden clouds cover less area, are thinner, and reflect less sunlight compared to their droplet-only counterparts. This results in darker clouds that absorb more infrared radiation, potentially diminishing the cooling effect typically provided by brighter clouds.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research illuminates the influence of industrial pollutants on weather patterns and their potential implications for climate modeling, a crucial but underexplored component of atmospheric science.\n\nWhat should be done with the information revealed in this groundbreaking study?\n\nThe new study's findings have wide-reaching implications for climate science, highlighting the need for deeper investigation into which pollutants most effectively drive ice nucleation and how to integrate these processes into future climate models.\n\nClimate scientists have their hands full when it comes to studying the impacts of particle pollution on our warming world. A recent Pennsylvania State University study pointed out how microplastics could affect our planet's weather and climate.\n\nThere is little argument that climate models need to be improved. Models failed to explain the record heat observed in 2023. Climate models are essential tools for enhancing our understanding and forecasting of climate behavior across seasonal to centennial time frames.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you believe there are factories near you causing undue pollution, you can also look into getting involved locally through community organizations directly or through donations.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n"

He called the fossil \u201cPunk.\u201d Then he found a similar fossil with downward-tipped spines reminiscent of long, side-swept \u201cemo\u201d bangs. He nicknamed that specimen after the emotional alt-rock genre.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Sutton and his colleagues published a paper in the journal Nature formally naming the creatures as the species Punk ferox and Emo vorticaudum. True to their names, these worm-mollusks are behind something of an upset (if not quite \u201canarchy in the U.K.\u201d) over scientists\u2019 understanding of the origins of one of the biggest groups of animals on Earth.\n\nIn terms of sheer number of species, mollusks are second only to arthropods (the group that contains insects, spiders and crustaceans). The better-known half of the mollusk family tree, conchiferans, contains animals like snails, clams and octopuses. \u201cThe other half is this weird and wacky group of spiny things,\u201d Dr. Sutton said. Some animals in this branch, the aculiferans, resemble armored marine slugs, while others are \u201cobscure, weird molluscan worms,\u201d he said."

Ann Altman says the alleged conduct began when her brother was 12 years old and he inappropriately touched her. She says he later sexually abused and raped her. Ann Altman says the abuse continued while her brother was a legal adult.\n\n\"At all times relevant herein, Defendant, Sam Altman, groomed and manipulated Plaintiff, Ann Altman, into believing the aforementioned sexual acts were her idea, despite the fact she was under the age of five years old when the sexual abuse began and Defendant was nearly a teenager,\" part of the lawsuit alleges. \"The foregoing level of childhood sexual abuse continued for a period of approximately eight or nine years.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: OpenAI launches new internal safety team with Sam Altman in control\n\nThe Missouri Childhood Sexual Abuse statute allows plaintiffs to file suit against their alleged abusers within a decade of turning 21; Ann Altman is 30.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

The suit claims the younger Altman is seeking a sum in excess of $75,000 for punitive damages and the cost of the suit.\n\nResponding to the suit, Sam Altman released an open letter, along with his father, mother, and two brothers, on X. The family claims \"Annie\" faces \"mental health challenges\" and they have long supported her personally and financially, and that she continues to demand money from them. The family also acknowledged that the lawsuit is not the first time Ann has accused her brother of abuse, but her lawsuit prompted their public response. They added that Ann has claimed the Altmans have hacked her WiFi and shadowbanned her from X and ChatGPT, the latter of which is the AI-enabled chatbot offshoot of Sam Altman's OpenAI.\n\n\"All of these claims are utterly untrue,\" the Altmans claim in their letter. \"This situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refuses conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.\"\n\nAltman is one of the original founders of OpenAI, along with Elon Musk and others."

These customers likely had the opportunity to learn about your products through ads, organic searches, word of mouth, or an influencer who is affiliated with your program.\n\nThus, affiliate coupon sites can end up at the bottom of the conversion funnel, which can lead to additional costs for traffic that has already been attracted to your site through other channels.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\n2. Coupon Codes Can Lead to Discount-Seeking Behavior & Lower Cart Values\n\nCoupons incentivize discounts merely by their nature. As with many brands, your goal for offering a deal will likely attract new and repeat customers. However, this can also backfire because it teaches consumers to secure the lowest price possible for the products they want. This can result in reduced average order value (AOV) over time, which can impact profitability. Encouraging a reliance on discounts can be an unintentional consequence of coupon affiliates.\n\n3. Customer Frustrations & the Risk to Brand Reputation\n\nCoupon affiliate programs work to accomplish their own business goals, which is to attract a constant stream of traffic to their own websites. To do this, they scrape all the possible codes and distribute them all, whether they are valid or not. This can lead to customers coming across expired coupon codes, which may create a less favorable experience with your brand.\n\n4. A Lack of Transparency in Coupon Code Distribution\n\nA common problem with affiliate coupon sites is that they often fail to disclose the methods of attracting users to their websites. They may be driving traffic through paid search campaigns, deceptive SEO practices, or unapproved partnerships with other websites and marketing platforms. This lack of clarity can make it more difficult for brands to formulate an effective marketing strategy for their affiliate programs.\n\nAffiliates who don\u2019t disclose their network connections and activities leave many brands in the dark about whether their codes are being used in ways that decrease the value of their brand, if and when violations occur, and what specific affiliates or third-party partners engage in the misuse of these codes. This uncertainty can challenge trust and hinder collaborative relationships between brands and affiliate partners.\n\nHow Bluepear Can Help Brands Track Coupon Affiliates\n\nThough coupon affiliate programs are often seen as a challenge in digital marketing, Bluepear can provide a solution with its brand protection technology. Below is a hypothetical brand, \u201cJam,\u201d to illustrate how Bluepear\u2019s technology helps combat affiliate coupon misuse.\n\nStep 1: Identifying Violations\n\nJam has to establish clear guidelines in its affiliate program terms and conditions. These terms include prohibitions on promotion through coupon codes and brand bidding.\n\nThough the policies clearly outline these guidelines, Jam notices that users access codes after searching ads that feature phrases like \u201c20% off Jam coupon.\u201d\n\nStep 2: Using Bluepear to Detect Coupon Misuse\n\nJam partners with Bluepear, and with their help, they are able to gain visibility into how their coupons are being misused.

A new study published in the journal Science describes how anthropogenic air pollution impacts the process of the formation of ice from supercooled cloud water droplets, which impacts our climate.\n\n\"There was an 8% reduction in cloud cover and an 18% reduction in cloud optical thickness,\" according to the study. \"Additionally, daily glaciation-induced snowfall accumulations reached 15 millimeters. Glaciation events downwind of industrial aerosol hot spots indicate that anthropogenic aerosols likely serve as ice-nucleating particles.\"\n\nDo you worry about air pollution in your town?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nResearchers studied cloud formations near 67 major industrial sites around the world. They discovered that pollution particles trigger ice formation, leading to snowfall that creates noticeable gaps or holes in cloud cover.\n\nWhy are air pollution's effects on cloud formation important?\n\n\"The findings indicate that industrial aerosols facilitate the formation of ice within clouds rather than just liquid droplets,\" according to the One Green Planet report. \"This ice formation not only contributes to localized snowfall but also affects the physical properties of clouds. Ice-laden clouds cover less area, are thinner, and reflect less sunlight compared to their droplet-only counterparts. This results in darker clouds that absorb more infrared radiation, potentially diminishing the cooling effect typically provided by brighter clouds.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research illuminates the influence of industrial pollutants on weather patterns and their potential implications for climate modeling, a crucial but underexplored component of atmospheric science.\n\nWhat should be done with the information revealed in this groundbreaking study?\n\nThe new study's findings have wide-reaching implications for climate science, highlighting the need for deeper investigation into which pollutants most effectively drive ice nucleation and how to integrate these processes into future climate models.\n\nClimate scientists have their hands full when it comes to studying the impacts of particle pollution on our warming world. A recent Pennsylvania State University study pointed out how microplastics could affect our planet's weather and climate.\n\nThere is little argument that climate models need to be improved. Models failed to explain the record heat observed in 2023. Climate models are essential tools for enhancing our understanding and forecasting of climate behavior across seasonal to centennial time frames.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you believe there are factories near you causing undue pollution, you can also look into getting involved locally through community organizations directly or through donations.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n"

However, a forest in a Zurich neighborhood is home to a bioluminescent mushroom that glows green. The mushroom\u2019s newly discovered bioluminescence is described in a study recently published in the journal Mycoscience.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nWhat is bioluminescence?\n\nBioluminescence is a chemical process where living organisms generate light. Jellyfish, fireflies, fungi, and more are all known to emit their very own glow. The Greek philosopher Aristotle observed bioluminescent fungi over 2,000 years ago, and he called them a \u201ccold fire\u201d emanating from decaying wood.\n\nAlthough the biological mechanism behind this glow is now fairly well understood, its ecological function remains elusive. Some glowing mushrooms are believed to attract insects to disperse spores, but bioluminescence occurring in parts of the fungi that are underground does not fit this hypothesis.\n\n\u201cIt seems that bioluminescence has been maintained for a long time, so we assume it has some function,\u201d Renate Heinzelmann, a study co-author mycologist at the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, said in a statement. \u201cBut it\u2019s still a mystery.\u201d\n\n[ Related: Surprise! These sea cucumbers glow. ]\n\nFinding the fungus\n\nThe mushroom was initially spotted by artists and study co-authors Heidy Baggenstos and Andreas Rudolf. The pair have been working with bioluminescent organisms for over a decade.\n\n\u201cWe want to show that these bioluminescent mushrooms are present in Swiss forests and that we do not have to travel far to find them,\u201d Baggenstos said in a statement.\n\nBaggenstos and Rudolf were walking through a forest in Zurich\u2019s Albisrieden neighborhood when they spotted some green light through their camera. Similar to the northern lights, fungus\u2019 natural light is sometimes so weak that it can\u2019t be seen with the naked eye and requires a camera to be visible.\n\nM. crocata growing on decaying wood. CREDIT: Baggenstos/Rudolf.\n\n\u201cNowadays we always have our mobile phones or a flashlight, but to see bioluminescence in the forest, it has to be pitch black,\u201d said Rudolf.\n\nThey collected some samples of the glowing specimen, originally thinking it was a known bioluminescent species called Mycena haematopus. In their well-lit studio, the artists realized that it was another species called the saffron drop bonnet mushroom (Mycena crocata). While this mushroom is known for its saffron-coloured milk, it had not previously been described as bioluminescent.\n\n[ Related: A simple experiment revealed the complex \u2018thoughts\u2019 of fungi. ]\n\nBaggenstos and Rudolf Heinzelmann to further characterize the discovery. The artists first used long exposure photographs and a luminometer\u2013a device that amplifies weaker light more than a camera does\u2013to measure how much light is emitted by different parts of the mushroom.\n\n\u201cMost of the experiments were conducted by the artists,\u201d said Heinzelmann. \u201cThey collected the samples, took the photographs, and made the light measurements.\u201d\n\nAn underground glow\n\nIn fungi, the key step towards bioluminescence occurs when the enzyme luciferase converts light-emitting compound called luciferin into an unstable product. This conversion then releases energy in the form of light when it decays. Unlike with fluorescence, this process does not need an external source of light.\n\nThe light measurements showed that the recognizable fruiting body of M. crocata that stands apart from the stipe base, is non-luminous. Instead, the fungi\u2019s mycelium\u2013the underground network of filaments similar to plant roots that absorb nutrients\u2013is the most bioluminescent. As a result, the decaying wood M. crocata grows on can also glow green when it is split open. This green glow can last up to four hours when the wood typically dries. When Baggenstos and Rudolf grew pure mycelia cultures, they remained bioluminescent for up to 164 days in optimal conditions.\n\nBioluminescence is sometimes observed at the base of the mushroom\u2019s stipe. CREDIT: Baggenstos/Rudolf.\n\nHeinzelmann\u2019s Genetic experiments confirmed the species identity and the presence of bioluminescence-related genes in all of the fungi of the Mycena genus that glow.\n\n\u201cThere will constantly be more bioluminescent species discovered,\u201d Heinzelmann predicts, \u201cBioluminescence is under-researched, and the more people look, the more they will find.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, doesn\u2019t think too highly of his scorned former collaborator Elon Musk, saying he will do \u201call sorts\u201d of bad things - but won\u2019t use his newfound political influence to take down competitors.\n\nDespite years of feuding and Musk leveling a dramatic lawsuit containing allegations of ethical violations against Altman and OpenAI, Altman defended Musk when asked if he thought Musk would use his political power and friendship with President-elect Donald Trump to target his rivals.\n\n\u201cOh, I think he\u2019ll do all sorts of bad s***,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg in an interview on Sunday. \u201cI think he\u2019ll continue to sue us and drop lawsuits and make new lawsuits and whatever else.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAltman continued, \u201c... Will he abuse his political power of being co-president, or whatever he calls himself now, to mess with a business competitor? I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll do that. I genuinely don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman once collaborated with Elon Musk to create the artificial intelligence company. While he doesn\u2019t think too fondly of Musk\u2019s future, he did say he doesn\u2019t believe Musk will use his new political influence to target rivals (Getty Images)\n\nMusk and Altman once sought to \u201csave\u201d humanity from the dangers of artificial intelligence through the co-founded company OpenAI \u2013 the parent company of ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, a dispute over the direction of the company, and an internal power struggle, led to a falling out between the two. Musk ultimately left the company in 2018 and has since worked to create his own AI company.\n\nThe battle between Altman and Musk turned publicly nasty last year when Musk filed a lawsuit against the company and Altman claiming he and other executives breached the company\u2019s founding agreement to benefit humanity over profit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk made his feelings about Altman and OpenAI evident in mocking social media posts.\n\nMusk dropped the lawsuit but filed another one against Altman and OpenAI, this time elevating his accusations to claim OpenAI worked with Microsoft, an investor, to create a monopoly. The billionaire also alleged the company violated its founding claim as a nonprofit by pursuing profit.\n\nOpenAI has denied the allegations.\n\nMusk has proven to be a powerful figure in politics thanks to his proximity to President-elect Donald Trump (Getty Images)\n\nIn December, the artificial intelligence company posted a lengthy, accusatory blog post that included screenshots of emails and texts showing Musk agreeing the company should pivot from nonprofit to for-profit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey claimed Musk bitterly left the company after the board refused to make him CEO or agree to his suggestion to merge Tesla and OpenAI. They claim Musk started his artificial intelligence company, xAI, to compete directly with OpenAI.\n\n\u201cHe says a lot of things, starts them, undoes them, gets sued, sues, gets in fights with the government, gets investigated by the government. That\u2019s just Elon being Elon,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg.\n\nBut Altman believes that he and Musk still share a \u201cconviction\u201d that artificial intelligence is important but needs to be handled carefully.\n\nDespite Musk\u2019s close proximity to Trump \u2013 having been named co-chair of the advisory board the Department of Government Efficiency \u2013 Altman does not think Musk would go so far as to use his power to quash a competitor.\n\n\u201cMay turn out to be proven wrong,\u201d Altman added."

Anthropic was valued at around US$18 billion in a fundraise led by Menlo Ventures last year.\n\nAnthropic declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the funding on Tuesday.\n\nAmazon late last year doubled its investment in the start-up to US$8 billion, as the e-commerce giant went up against Big Tech rivals in a race to capitalise on generative AI technology.

            "article_content": "The war between Russia and Ukraine has become a major geopolitical crisis of the 21st century. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, numerous countries, including the US, UK, EU, Australia, Canada, and Japan, have imposed over 19,535 sanctions against Russia. Their primary focus has been on Russia's financial resources. Approximately half of its total reserves\u2014amounting to $350 billion\u2014were frozen, impacting its foreign currency reserves. According to the EU, approximately 70 percent of the assets of Russian banks were frozen by a high-speed messaging service for financial institutions.\n\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine has undoubtedly influenced the relationship between Moscow and its allies. Following the imposition of sanctions on Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a significant swing towards China, signing a series of agreements. The impact of this war was not only on Western and Russian relations but also on Russia's close allies. In this regard, Central Asian countries are now forced to strike a difficult balance between their long-standing relations with Russia and other large powers. While the region has historically relied on Russia for economic and security relationships, the protracted conflict has produced new challenges and possibilities, prompting these countries to pursue a more assertive but cautious foreign policy. At the same time, this upheaval and Russia's dependence on China create a golden opportunity for China to strengthen its ties with Central Asia.\n\nThough, since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the five Central Asian countries have gained more political and economic independence. Historically, the Central Asian Republics (CARs)\u2014Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan\u2014have always viewed Russia as a guarantor of security for internal stability and protection against foreign threats. Since their independence from the Soviet Union, Central Asian countries have faced a difficult transition from a common Soviet history to divergent nation-building and economic liberalisation pathways. The five Central Asian states are part of one or more Russian-led organisations, including the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), and the Eurasian Economic Union. These institutions provide forums for regional security and economic partnership with Russia, allowing Russia to maintain a substantial influence in Central Asia's geopolitical landscape. For example, in 2021, when the Taliban reclaimed control in Afghanistan, Russia stationed military equipment on the Tajik-Afghan border as part of the CSTO and conducted joint military drills with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan within 20 kilometres from the Afghan border. This exhibition aims to demonstrate Russia's military readiness in its own backyard in the event of an attack on Central Asia by the Taliban or other terrorist outfits. Similarly, in January 2022, Moscow dispatched soldiers from the CSTO to quash unrest in Kazakhstan.\n\nEconomically, Central Asia also depended on Russia. Moscow's energy and trade participation in the region was intended to lock the governments into a vital dependency, giving the Kremlin control over their internal and foreign policy decisions. For example, Kazakhstan exports 80 percent of its oil through the Caspian oil pipeline, which passes through Russian territory. The number of economic migrants who go to Russia for work is relatively high compared to other migrant workers worldwide. For example, approximately nine million Central Asians live and work in Russia, and practically every major city relies on their labour. According to a June 2022 report by the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM), remittances from Russia to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan accounted for 31 percent and 27 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2020. The majority of this money is expected to come from their employees in Russia. In 2021, remittances from Russia accounted for 55 percent of total transfers to Uzbekistan and 51 percent to Kazakhstan.\n\nHowever, the CARs' internal unrest, Russia's actions in Ukraine, and growing concerns about sovereignty have forced Central Asian nations to look for new allies for long-term security cooperation and are diversifying their foreign policy in an effort to reduce Moscow's influence. Furthermore, Western sanctions on Russia led the CARs to seek alternate channels to sell commodities to the world market. Therefore, CARs have responded to the altering geopolitical landscape in a variety of ways, including preserving economic links with Russia, avoiding outright criticism of Moscow, and increasing partnerships with other global powers such as China, the West, and Turkey.\n\nSince the beginning of the Russian-Ukraine war, Central Asian leaders have also been at the forefront of the so-called \"multi-vector\" foreign policy approach, aiming for balanced relations with Russia as well as other countries such as China, the West, and Turkey. The states of the region refused to accept Russia's recently seized areas in Ukraine, and some issued public declarations in support of Ukraine's territorial integrity in the early days of the 2022 war.\n\nNonetheless, these powers did not openly condemn Vladimir Putin and his \"special military operation.\" Various factors are at play here, including economic reliance, Central Asian immigration, and membership in Russia-led institutions.\n\nMoreover, according to polls, the majority of Central Asians\u201470 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 55 percent in Kazakhstan, and 30 percent in Uzbekistan\u2014ascribe the regions current economic difficulties to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The popularity of the Russian language is declining, entertainment venues are refusing to host Russian performers, and there have been multiple anti-war protests in Almaty and Bishkek. Russia has blocked Central Asian media sites for attempting to provide unbiased coverage of the conflict in Ukraine. The public conversation has returned to the topic of decolonisation.\n\nOn the other hand, Central Asia is a strategically important region for China due to its abundant resources, transit links, and shared border, which are vital for China's security. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) underscores its interest in the region, leveraging growing unease and Russia's focus on Ukraine. Central Asian nations increasingly rely on China for both security and economic resources, potentially challenging Russian dominance and jeopardising Moscow's security interests. Despite a recent decline in historical hostility between the two sides, Russia believes that China's increasing economy might soon enable it to contest Moscow's geopolitical sway in Central Asia.\n\nNotably, China is assisting the CARs in strengthening their security and law enforcement capabilities by capitalising on their worries about Russia. During his visit to Central Asia in September 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that he supported Kazakhstan's territorial integrity in light of these exceptional circumstances. When Xi called the China-Central Asia Summit to order in Xi'an in May 2023, he emphasised the significance of the security, sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the CARs. In the midst of the intensifying powerplay among the world's strongest nations, Beijing is taking big measures to expand its regional influence in order to counter the US's encirclement of China.\n\nChina is still dedicated to its long-standing regional objectives. With over half of China's trade and investment going to Kazakhstan, Beijing sees the country as its main economic partner in Central Asia. China's economic interests are further supported by the transportation opportunities that have emerged since Russia's invasion.\n\nBeijing is becoming increasingly interested in playing the role of a security supplier in the region due to its rising concerns about the unrest in Afghanistan and Central Asia. This development may cause future difficulties with Moscow. China-Central Asia's security cooperation has already been strengthened by BRI efforts. More robust security allies like China could undermine Russia's position as the principal security guarantor. China's growing influence in Central Asia after the invasion presents a challenge to Moscow's dominance, potentially altering the dynamics of security cooperation and posing future complications for Moscow.\n\nMd Tariqul Islam Tanvir is Erasmus scholar in the International Master in Central & East European, Russian & Eurasian Studies programme at the University of Glasgow.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\n\nWe welcome your contributions and analysis of global events, and responses to our articles.

            "article_content": "US special operations forces are shifting their focus after decades of counterterrorism.\n\nCompetition with China and Russia is reshaping how SOF supports the joint force.\n\nA senior Pentagon official said that special operations is also returning to its \"roots.\"\n\nA senior Pentagon official said this week that the role of US special operations is changing as the US faces increasing competition and challenges from China and Russia.\n\nAD\n\nWith the threat of a conflict against a powerful and advanced adversary looming, special operations forces are returning to their \"roots,\" Christopher Maier, the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, said.\n\nThe direction of special operations forces (SOF) is adapting to the largest challenges facing the US \u2014 a rapidly growing Chinese military and Russian state set on expansion by force.\n\nAD\n\nMaier said during a conversation with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank on Tuesday that SOF is \"still doing counterterrorism, crisis response, those have been the persistent missions,\" but the priority is shifting towards \"increasingly where we can support other elements, largely in a support role, for those strategic competition elements.\"\n\nThat means playing a big role in solving challenges facing the joint force, like more modern adaptations to using artificial intelligence, as well as the traditional functions of SOF, such as \"being that sensor out there and providing the necessary input to decision makers to better understand a situation,\" noted Maier, who previously led the Pentagon's Defeat-ISIS Task Force overseeing the campaign across Iraq and Syria that relied heavily on American special operators.\n\nSpecial operators are the US military's most highly trained troops, the go-to teams for small raids and secretive missions, but they lack the numbers and firepower to go up against larger conventional forces for long.\n\nAD\n\nUS special operations forces are supporting the joint force as the US faces strategic competition with China and Russia. US Air Force photo by Senior Airman Lauren Cobin\n\nMuch of the US' special operations presence in over 80 countries around the world is focused on working closely with foreign militaries, law enforcement, and embassies to keep a finger on the pulse. For the past 20 years, the US has relied on these forces for some the most unconventional and difficult missions, like teaming with partner forces to fight enemies or running shadowy helicopter assaults to kill or capture key leaders.\n\nRelated stories\n\nMaier said he views it as both a continuation of the counterterrorism and crisis response that SOF has been doing for decades and also a step back to its origins.\n\n\"We're going back to the proverbial roots of supporting the joint force with some of the hardest problems against peer adversaries,\" Maier said.\n\nAD\n\nWith the so-called War on Terror, SOF has spent over 20 years operating in counterterrorism and unconventional warfare roles, fighting quietly in a variety of environments across the world and maintaining relationships that provide the US with information on tactics of specific groups and deeper understandings of regional and security issues.\n\nThat role is now changing, albeit just as important. In a 2023 article for the Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank, David Ucko, a professor and expert on irregular warfare, argues that leaders in Washington need to examine how to best use SOF for newer challenges against Russia and China. That includes irregular warfare, which is \"highly relevant\" to strategic competition with China.\n\nBut, Ucko notes, special operators fill a particular role in military operations and shouldn't be given missions that other US agencies or groups can also do.\n\nAD\n\nOne of the deepest challenges these secretive forces face is the widening surveillance by spy satellites and recon drones.\n\nWhile special operations has often led the fight on counterterrorism, the shift towards peer adversary competition is changing that focus. Master Sgt. Timothy Lawn/US Army Central\n\nSOF missions often have multiple objectives like foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare; special operators can, for example, help boost a US ally's defense tactics against a foreign aggressor, such as Taiwan and China.\n\nAllied special forces played critical roles in World War II, shaped by the need for specialization in unconventional missions and innovative tactics, such as sabotage behind enemy lines and disrupting German supply lines. In North Africa, British Special Air Services and Commonwealth Long Range Desert Group commandos aided in disrupting Axis troops deployments and airpower.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the Cold War, special operators played a role in deterring the Soviet Union's influence, maintaining presence in and relationships with Western Europe and other areas.\n\nSpecial operations forces often focus on irregular or unconventional operations best suited for small units of highly trained operators. US Navy photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Steven D. Patzer\n\nAll of that historical context is informing SOF's priorities today, as the US faces similar challenges against China and Russia and their activities across the world, Maier said.\n\n\"The differences, I think, here are some of the fundamental changes in adversaries' ability to access technology,\" he added, and their ability to \"use different types of techniques than maybe we saw in the Cold War.\"\n\nAD\n\nBoth China and Russia are actively engaged in bolstering their irregular warfare tactics, including reconnaissance, disinformation, electronic warfare, cyberspace and space efforts, and psychological warfare.\n\nIn its report on China's military growth over the course of 2023, the Pentagon noted that China is expanding its capabilities towards a vision of future conflict it calls \"intelligentized warfare\" focused on AI, data, and controlling information spaces.\n\nOther elements, such as China's campaigns in Taiwan to influence domestic politics and opinions on unification, are also notable."

            "article_content": "Rigetti Computing (RGTI), IonQ (IONQ), and other quantum computing stocks fell more than 40% Wednesday after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang told Wall Street analysts that \u201cvery useful quantum computers\u201d are likely 20 years away.\n\nRigetti Computing dropped over 49%, and IonQ dropped 47%. Fellow stocks in the sector, D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) and Quantum Computing (QUBT), plummeted 48% and 50%, respectively.\n\nResponding to a question from Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis during a conversation with analysts at the tech industry\u2019s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas, Huang said, \u201cQuantum computing can't solve every problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you kind of said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that'd probably be on the early side. If you said 30 is probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it,\u201d he said.\n\nQuantum computing stocks enjoyed a massive rally in late November and throughout December as growing interest and technological advancements fueled bets that the technology would take off sooner rather than later.\n\nIn November, Amazon launched a quantum computing advisory program, saying in its announcement that the initiative will help AWS customers \u201cget ready for quantum computing.\u201d IonQ said on Nov. 18 that it had successfully run Nvidia\u2019s quantum computing developer kit on its hardware. Quantum Computing Inc. said it had taken stock of advanced chips it\u2019s using to advance its quantum software.\n\nThe US government gave a nod to the budding industry when a group of bipartisan US senators on Dec. 3 introduced a bill that would reauthorize the 2018 National Quantum Initiative Act and pledged an additional $2.7 billion for quantum computing research to develop practical applications. Then, on Dec. 9, Google introduced a new quantum computing chip called Willow, and the company said it had found a way to increase the power of the chip while cutting down some of the problems associated with the technology (typically, the more powerful the quantum computer, the more prone it is to errors).\n\nEven with their massive drops Wednesday, Quantum Computing is up nearly 1,400% from six months ago, while Rigetti has risen more than 850%, D-Wave has soared 360%, and IonQ has jumped 265% over that time frame.\n\nA cryostat refrigerator for cooling quantum computing chips is displayed at Google's Quantum AI lab in Santa Barbara, California, U.S., in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters on December 6, 2024. Google/Handout via REUTERS \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\n\nThough Huang sees the tech taking longer to reach practical applicability, Nvidia is still betting on it. Huang said Nvidia is working with \u201cjust about every quantum computing company.\u201d Nvidia in 2022 began extending its CUDA software development kit (currently used by developers to make artificial intelligence applications) for quantum software developers.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "On the night of August 10, 2022, five pilots on two separate commercial airline flights were wholly convinced they\u2019d documented proof of an Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP) over the Pacific Ocean. Pilots from both flights reported seeing odd lights zipping through the sky\u2014but the single incident they all witnessed turned out to be Starlink telecommunications satellites.\n\nIn recent years, pilots\u2014as well as the public\u2014have mistakenly identified these low-Earth orbit satellites as UAPs. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of 69 reports just from January 23\u2013April 27, 2023 that identify \u201cUFO-UAP,\u201d and according to one paper , more than a third of them could be Starlink satellites. Unfortunately, such mysterious sightings lead to pilot confusion and potential safety consequences because of the distraction and extra chatter about them over the airwaves.\n\nThe core issue with pilots misidentifying satellites as UAPs stems from the fact that pilots cannot access real-time data about satellite movements, leaving them unprepared to recognize strange lights in the sky. These satellites may appear to move in unexpected ways, based on their orientation, and they may also appear and disappear, since their solar arrays reflect sunlight at different angles when deployed, relative to the pilot\u2019s position in flight.\n\nStarlink satellites orbit about 342 miles above Earth, according to Starlink\u2019s website, and that places them lower than most other satellites, making them visible to our eyes as spots of light, no magnification needed. More than 6,000 Starlink satellites are currently circling Earth, and the SpaceX-owned company aims to eventually have 42,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit, which means pilots will need to have surefire methods for identifying them.\n\n\n\nGetty Images The passage of Starlink satellites is seen in the sky over southern Poland on November 1, 2024.\n\nFour scientists want to fill the information gap in this type of situation to prevent unnecessary aviation risk. Led by mechanical engineer Douglas J. Buettner of the University of Utah, the team devised a method to simulate the exact locations of satellites, and they proposed plans that would provide pilots with the information they need to quickly identify satellites. Their paper describing this work was accepted at the 2024 International Academy of Astronautics Conference on Space Situational Awareness (ICSSA).\n\nTo shed some light on what the five pilots saw, the scientists conducted an \u201castrometric analysis\u201d of their reports, using two cell phone photos and a video the pilots had taken of \u201can unrecognized and possibly anomalous phenomenon,\u201d according to the paper. To corroborate the data, researchers looked up Starlink\u2019s records, noting that the visual line the satellites created in the sky\u2014called a \u201ctrain\u201d of satellites\u2014launched that same day. The team also used data from the flight, including photographs taken in the cockpit. Using these pieces of information and an orbital mechanics software tool, they were able to reconstruct the August 10 cockpit view. It showed Starlink satellites matching both the time and place of the sighting.\n\nTheir analysis used a technique called \u201cray-traced rendering\u201d of the view from the pilots\u2019 cockpit, which provided a more visual simulation of exactly where the pilots saw the satellites through their cockpit windows, according to the paper. The simulation experiments indicated that the satellites\u2019 solar arrays must have been deployed, likely making them glint brightly enough for the pilots in both aircraft to notice them. \u201cIn the implementation of our approach, we were able to closely match the apparent speed in degrees per second traveled by the object between the two photographs taken by one of the pilots,\u201d the scientists wrote.\n\nThe team hopes that their work demonstrates a plan that could plausibly \u201cwarn aviators and the public about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations,\u201d and therefore support aviation safety, they wrote. In the future, it\u2019s worth studying how the deployment of a satellite\u2014as well as its surface materials\u2014affects the way it reflects sunlight, the paper adds. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said on X that the satellite orientation could be adjusted to minimize solar reflection during astronomical experiments, though the team\u2019s paper does not specifically address this possibility.\n\nThe authors do suggest various procedures and technologies that aircraft could deploy to support accurate UAP identification. For example, pilots should be allowed to \u201croutinely provide photographic evidence from either an automated system when they are busy with safety critical aircraft operations, or using cell phones when they are not allowed,\u201d to greatly improve UAP analysis.\n\nSatellite operators should also provide information about satellite movements\u2014such as orientation, orbit location, and deployment timelines\u2014to support more accurate and detailed models, the scientists write. Finally, they suggest a way for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reduce in-flight risks due to pilots trying to determine the source of a UAP. Air traffic controllers could have access to a satellite-modeling system that would enable them to anticipate satellite sightings and alert the pilots when necessary. \u201cWe envision this as a collaborative effort between the satellite\u2019s owners (in this case SpaceX/Starlink), the FAA, NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Space Force,\u201d the authors note.\n\nAs for people on the ground, anyone can find Starlink in the sky. Look up on a clear, dark night, and if you see a white light or \u201ctrain\u201d of lights moving across the sky, go to FindStarlink.com. You can search for your time and location and determine if what you see is indeed Starlink satellites."

One such revolutionary moment is being celebrated in 2025, which the United Nations has declared to be the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. This marks the centenary of the advent of quantum mechanics, which began in a flurry of papers 100 years ago. Just as it would be impossible to make sense of modern biology without Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, our fundamental understanding of the physical world is now rooted in quantum principles. Modern physics is quantum physics.\n\nThe word quantum refers to the way matter absorbs or releases energy \u2014 in discrete packets, or quanta. Its use in physics comes from the German word quant, which is derived from a Latin term meaning \u2018how much\u2019. In around 1900, physicists such as Max Planck and Albert Einstein began to describe, in an ad hoc way, why several phenomena of the subatomic realm could not be explained using the classical mechanics developed by Isaac Newton and others some two centuries earlier. Then, in 1925, quantum came to be used to describe the fundamentals of an entirely new form of mechanics \u2014 the branch of physics that describes the relationship between forces and the motion of physical objects.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nAs science historian Kristian Camilleri describes in an Essay on the startling developments of that year and those that followed, the physicist Werner Heisenberg travelled to the German island of Heligoland in the North Sea in the summer of 1925 in search of relief from severe hay fever. Shortly after this, he submitted to the journal Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik a paper whose title translates as \u2018On quantum-theoretical reinterpretation of kinematic and mechanical relationships\u2019 (W. Heisenberg Z. Physik 33, 879\u2013893; 1925). This prompted further studies in the following months by Heisenberg and his close collaborators, as well as work using an alternative approach by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.\n\nThe revolution did not begin with physicists throwing away the laws of classical mechanics, but with their radically reinterpreting classical concepts such as energy and momentum. However, it did require its initiators to abandon dearly held common-sense ideas \u2014 for example, the expectation that subatomic objects such as particles have a well-defined position and momentum at any given time. Instead, the physicists found that natural phenomena had an inherently unknowable nature. Classical physics, in other words, is only an approximate representation of reality, and manifests itself only at the macroscopic level. A century on, this insight into the nature of the physical world still thrills and bamboozles in equal measures. Many Nature readers will know about the philosophical quandaries raised by quantum cats that are simultaneously dead and alive, and about the industry that is growing around quantum computing.\n\nOthers will know how quantum ideas gave rise to the lasers that beam information through the cables of the Internet, and the transistors that provide the processing power of electronic chips. But quantum ideas also shape our understanding of nature, at all levels, explaining why solid objects don\u2019t fall apart and how stars shine and, ultimately, die.\n\nA quantum year\n\nCommemorative events are being planned all over the world for the coming 12 months. They include an opening ceremony for the UN year at the headquarters of the UN scientific organization UNESCO in Paris in February; special events at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Anaheim, California, in March; and a workshop for physicists on Heligoland in June. The organizers\u2019 collective ambition is to celebrate not just the centenary of quantum mechanics, but also the science and applications that arose from it in the past century \u2014 and to explore how quantum physics might bring further change in the century to come.\n\nThis billion-dollar firm plans to build giant quantum computers from light. Can it succeed?\n\nIn May, Ghana, the country that originally proposed that the UN proclaim 2025 the year of quantum science, is hosting an international conference on the topic in Kumasi. And in August, science historians will meet to celebrate the quantum century in Salvador de Bahia in Brazil.\n\nThis meeting will be the high point of a 20-year research programme that set out to re-examine the development of quantum theory. One major aim of that work, says historian Michel Janssen at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, was to establish the contributions of a collective of scientists, many of whom \u2014 particularly women \u2014 have not been recognized in the history of the field.\n\nThese \u201chidden figures\u201d include Lucy Mensing, who was a member of the same group as Heisenberg and worked out some of the first applications of his quantum-mechanical theory, says Daniela Monaldi, a historian at York University in Toronto, Canada. One of the most notable events of the year will be the publication of a biographical volume of essays on 16 of them, Women in the History of Quantum Physics.\n\nGerman physicists Otto Stern (pictured) and Walther Gerlach demonstrated quantum spin in the famous Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment of 1922.Credit: AIP Emilio Segr\u00e8 Visual Archives, Segr\u00e8 Collection\n\nFor all that it has already brought, the quantum revolution still has unfinished business. In the years in which researchers were laying the foundations of quantum mechanics, they also began to rebuild other branches of physics \u2014 such as the study of electromagnetism, and states of matter \u2014 from quantum foundations. They also looked to extend their theories to encompass objects that move at close to light speed, something that the original quantum theory did not. These efforts drastically expanded the scope of quantum science and led researchers to develop the standard model of particles and fields, a process that finally came together in the 1970s.\n\n\u2018A truly remarkable breakthrough\u2019: Google\u2019s new quantum chip achieves accuracy milestone\n\nThe standard model has been incredibly successful, culminating in the 2012 discovery of its linchpin elementary particle, the Higgs boson. But these extensions lie on less-solid theoretical ground than quantum mechanics does \u2014 and leave several phenomena unexplained, such as the nature of the \u2018dark matter\u2019 that seems to greatly outweigh conventional, visible matter in the wider cosmos. Moreover, one important phenomenon, gravity, still resists being quantized.\n\nOther conceptual problems of quantum physics remain open. In particular, researchers struggle to understand what exactly happens when experiments \u2018collapse\u2019 the fuzzy probabilities of quantum objects into one precise measurement, a key step in creating the \u2014 still remorselessly classical \u2014 macroscopic world we live in. Over the past few decades, researchers have been developing ways to turn these quirks of quantum reality into useful technologies. The resulting applications in computing, ultra-secure communications and innovative scientific instruments are still in their nascent stages.\n\nQuantum theory keeps on giving. This year is an opportunity to celebrate and to make the broader public aware of the role that quantum physics has in their lives \u2014 and to inspire future generations, whoever they are and wherever they are in the world, to contribute to another quantum century."
