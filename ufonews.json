        "article_content": "Alejandro Rojas, a UFO expert at Enigma based out of Arizona, told rdnewsNOW that sightings usually coordinate with population.\n\n\u201cWherever there\u2019s more people, there\u2019s more sightings,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s also outreach. For example, who knows about us and who knows where to report. We have enough connections in Canada that Canadians often participate.\u201d\n\nEnigma allows the public to upload pictures and videos of UFO\u2019s across the world which is used by researchers and scientists. It also allows for community scientists and the rest of the users to crowd analyze the sightings. The data collected is from those reported by the public but also through historical databases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that the northern lights in particular caused a lot of sighting reports and really it\u2019s because people are outside looking at the sky for an extended period of time,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhen they do that, often they see something they can\u2019t explain.\u201d\n\nOften UFOs seen by people can vary in shape and size but Rojas said there are more frequent types of shapes.\n\nPoints of light and spheres are the more common reported, which makes sense because people sometimes see what appear to be satellites but are unsure of what they are.\n\n\u201cThose are also some of the most mysterious ones because one of the most frequent types of sightings is seeing what they think is a satellite but then it starts to do something weird like zig zag or speed up,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the most recent reports in Red Deer came in April and August of this year. However, one case was also reported in November 2023.\n\nRed Deer resident Shelby Leclarc said she and her partner have a nightly routine where they\u2019ll watch for satellites and look at the different constellations.\n\nOn that night in November she looked up at the sky and after watching a plane go by she saw multiple moving orange dots in the sky.\n\nThey also twinkled like a star but was much more noticeable and moved faster than the plane. The UFO\u2019s were more circular shape and did not make any sound.\n\n\u201cWhat the heck was that,\u201d Leclarc remembers saying. \u201cSeeing lights you don\u2019t recognize is a little weird. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it since.\u201d\n\nA year ago, David Grusch. a former U.S. intelligence official and whistle blower said at a congressional hearing under oath, that the U.S. government is in possession of non-human space crafts as well as bodies of deceased corpses.\n\nThe claims raised many questions and also excitement online and in social media.\n\nRojas explained that those were just claims without any evidence. However, he did say the government has a lot of secrecy around this topic.\n\n\u201cThe manner in which they collect all of that data is classified so they\u2019re not in the best position to share a lot of data with the public,\u201d Rojas said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always going to lead to secrecy and speculation about what they know. I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that they really know much.\n\n\u201cI think one thing that\u2019s exciting is that they have admitted they\u2019re having reports of these metallic orb type things. They don\u2019t know what they are and they haven\u2019t figured it out.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Carl Petrick is a sky-watcher.\n\nThe East Moline resident and Moline native is a retired longtime zookeeper at Niabi Zoo. He studies his surroundings with scientific attention. Science is his religion, Petrick said. The 66-year-old just wants to figure it all out.\n\n\u201cMoving things,\u201d in particular, are fascinating to him. He\u2019s an avid bird-watcher. Birds\u2019 camouflaging abilities, their ability to fly into the wind, their speed \u2014 it\u2019s all impressive to Petrick.\n\n\u201cPeople are smart, but we can't do some of the things they do,\u201d he said.\n\nPetrick is willing to go to great lengths to identify birds he spots in local parks \u2014 once, he chased a bird 50 yards just to get answers after he glimpsed it through a bush. Eventually, he tracked it down.\n\nBut there\u2019s one flyer that got away. It\u2019s nagged at him for more than 50 years.\n\nPetrick is one of several Quad-Citians who reported seeing UFOs over several days in early March 1967. At the time, Petrick was a 9-year-old student at Sacred Heart Catholic School, now Seton Catholic, in Moline.\n\nThe record of this local UFO phenomenon, which stretched across multiple counties in western Illinois, is part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force investigation of UFOs in the 1950s and 1960s, a time of heightened concern due to the Cold War.\n\nNuns, sheriff\u2019s deputies, elementary students and more reported seeing something in the sky that spring.\n\nThe story is still vivid in Petrick\u2019s head.\n\nIf he stares long enough at a wall, he can close his eyes and see it like it was yesterday.\n\nIt\u2019s not an airplane\n\nPetrick saw it between 2 and 3 p.m., as he went back inside for class, he said. The weather was chilly but clear.\n\n\u201cI looked up and I saw something in the distance,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nTo his naked eye, the object in the western sky looked like a spot or a small silvery thing. He estimated its height to be like that of airplanes when they emit contrails as they fly over.\n\nAs Petrick watched the object, Bill Fisher, a Moline police officer, came around the corner. The officer had binoculars or a movie camera with him. Fisher looked at the object then handed the instrument he carried to Petrick.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d the police officer asked the boy.\n\nWith the instrument\u2019s assistance, Petrick saw a silver, cigar-shaped object with what Petrick described as three long windows along the side. Those windows were powder blue, like the jersey shade of the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThe thing was not moving and Petrick estimated its length to be between 20 and 40 feet.\n\nPetrick told Fisher the thing was not an airplane, then the police officer said he had to go.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last I saw of him,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nThat day, Fisher recorded the object with a portable 8mm movie camera. He and his recording would be a central part of the Air Force\u2019s investigation.\n\nAfter Fisher left, Petrick watched the object for about 10 more minutes before returning to class, he said. About 30 or 45 minutes later, he came back outside.\n\n\u201cIt was still there,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nAt home a short time later, he observed it again with his father and brother, using a small telescope. The object still had not moved and its appearance remained the same.\n\nPetrick does not know what the object was, but he said he knows what it wasn\u2019t. It was not a bird or a butterfly, he said. It was not an airplane, helicopter or zeppelin.\n\nBy the process of elimination, he concluded it was a UFO.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, so obviously and logically, it would be unidentified,\u201d he said. \u201cJust common sense.\u201d\n\nNow decades removed from the event, Petrick said he does not think the object had a human origin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not from here,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just observing us like we observe.\u201d\n\nPetrick said he saw the object in the same place in the sky for several days after those initial sightings.\n\nThen, one day, it wasn\u2019t there.\n\nInitially, he thought it might have moved. After a bit more time, he decided it was gone for good.\n\nDuck and cover\n\nAt the time of the Quad-Cities sighting, the Cold War was in full swing. The rivalry between America and the Soviet Union even extended into space.\n\nPetrick remembered a childhood game he and his friends played, inspired by the monthly emergency siren tests. When they heard the siren, the children would pretend the Russians were attacking.\n\nPeople feared a nuclear holocaust, Petrick said. Incidents like the Bay of Pigs had occurred and the conflict in Vietnam was heating up.\n\n\u201cWe were so inundated with the Cold War\u2019s \u2018Russians are bad, we\u2019re good,\u2019\u201d Petrick said.\n\nHe also described an exercise he had to do at school: the duck-and-cover drill.\n\n\u201cIf the siren goes off, get under your desk because if a bomb explodes, you\u2019ll be protected,\u201d he said.\n\nShould they find themselves in the hallway, children were supposed to get against the wall and cover themselves as best they could, he said.\n\nThe school phased that drill out while he was still a student.\n\nThere was also a big emphasis on science in school because of the Cold War. The Russians had their Sputnik satellite. The Americans were after the Moon.\n\nAfter he saw the object in the sky that day, Petrick said, he considered, then discarded, the possibility that another nation was behind it.\n\n\u201cIf it was Russian or Chinese or whatever, you think it would have been attacking the States or would have been doing something to throw us off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just sat there.\u201d\n\nNot just Petrick\n\nPetrick wasn\u2019t the only person in the Quad-Cities who spotted a UFO that week. The local newspapers covered the phenomenon extensively.\n\nJames Maifield, of Silvis, reported that he and his wife spotted a \u201cwhite light\u201d in the sky for several minutes. An anonymous Silvis police dispatcher told the Moline Dispatch she saw a \u201cweird\u201d white light, too.\n\nGary Bennett, an Augustana College student, told the Times-Democrat he saw an \u201cunfamiliar airborne vehicle\u201d around 9:30 p.m. on March 9.\n\nArnold Buchmeyer, Helen DeRocker and Leo Schmitz, all of Moline, separately reported to the Times-Democrat that they saw something strange in the sky, too. Schmitz said it was \u201cvery white\u201d and \u201cmoving northwesterly.\u201d\n\nA Northwestern University astronomer speculated that it was just the planet Venus.\n\nThe weekend after the sightings, pranksters were caught deploying a balloon with a candle that crash-landed in Rock Island. A similar balloon was found near the Monmouth waste disposal plant on Thursday, March 9, pieced together with soda straws.\n\nJimmie Scott, a 12-year-old from Buffalo, Iowa, told the Times-Democrat he got out of bed around 2 a.m. on March 9 to get a drink of water. He looked into the sky and saw a \u201cbright, white object that looked like a saucer.\u201d\n\nHis sketch of the saucer was published on the front pages of the Times-Democrat.\n\nThe principal witness, though, was Fisher, the Moline officer who greeted Petrick on the campus of Sacred Heart.\n\nThe star witness\n\nAfter the Quad-Cities area sightings drew the attention of the federal government, Fisher was interviewed at length by the U.S. Air Force, who sent Capt. Edward Orenic and Capt. Anton Kato to investigate.\n\nAfter their visit, they produced a 94-page report on their methods, avenues of inquiry and conclusions. The report is available online through the U.S. National Archives.\n\nThe two captains cast a wide net, the report shows. Their efforts included interviewing witnesses and collecting weather data. They also checked with regional military, airport and National Weather Service officials for aircraft and weather balloon flights as well as for reports of anything strange.\n\nOrenic and Kato took particular interest in Fisher\u2019s account and the footage he took.\n\nThe officer told the Air Force that he was initially at Sacred Heart on March 9 to deliver a message to his son, a student there. He arrived around 1:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cAt this time, I glanced upward above the treetops and viewed a object that I was not sure of its description or its identity,\u201d he told investigators.\n\nHe described the object as \u201cU-shaped \u2014 like a pickle,\u201d and said he watched it for \u201ca precious minute and a half.\u201d Soon after, he began shooting footage with his 8mm camera, using a telescopic lens and outdoor film. The footage is also available online in the U.S. National Archives.\n\nFisher told the Dispatch in 2015 that he kept the camera in storage on his motorcycle, aware that UFO rumors were already swirling in town.\n\n\u201cThere were stories all around,\u201d he told the Dispatch. \u201cI was just naturally curious.\u201d\n\nAfter he arrived on the campus, Fisher says the object then began moving \u201cnorthwesterly\u201d away from him. It \u201cappeared to have stopped\u201d and hovered, he said, and then it continued its pace until it faded from view.\n\n\u201cBefore it faded away here, before it got completely obscure, I did have a definite sighting of a metallic, shiny surface on the side,\u201d he said. \u201cThe side that was the broad side to me, was metallic and appeared to be of the same construction like some of our large aircrafts that I\u2019ve seen here.\u201d\n\nAs he stood at the school, Fisher asked several kids and a state policeman\u2019s wife about what they saw. The woman told him it \u201clooked shiny and reflected a white light.\u201d Fisher said he didn\u2019t spot any lights or objects connected to the craft. He heard no sound emitted from the object, but the woman reported a hissing or whirring sound.\n\nIn the report, captains Orenic and Kato also highlighted the accounts of two sheriff\u2019s deputies, one from Knox County and the other from Henry County.\n\nThe Knox County deputy\u2019s account was that early on March 6, 1967, he saw a flying object.\n\nHis account included that it was shaped like an upside-down bowl, the report states. It had a glowing red base and at one point emitted a bright beam of white light.\n\nThe deputy from Henry County saw something in the sky late on March 8, the report states.\n\nThe deputy\u2019s description included that the object was framed by three lights \u2014 one red, one white and one green. Periodically it would emit an intense red light bright enough to obscure the other three lights.\n\nSo what\u2019s the verdict?\n\nOrenic and Kato concluded at the end of the report that the sightings most likely involved the mundane.\n\nIn Fisher\u2019s case, the object was most likely an air vehicle \u2013 a plane or helicopter, the report states. In another part of the report, Orenic and Kato also state it could have been a balloon.\n\n\u201cThe description, duration and flight characteristics are similar to that of a balloon,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe 8mm film failed to reveal any information that would dispute this evaluation.\u201d\n\nThe captains said the Henry County deputy\u2019s sighting was also likely an aircraft.\n\nThe Knox County sighting was probably of a home-made hot air balloon created using a garment bag, similar to the one Rock Island pranksters made the weekend of March 12, and the one recovered in the Monmouth area. The method of making the balloons had been published in a national magazine, the report states.\n\nDuring that period, two red kites along with batteries and a light bulb were also recovered in the Galesburg area, according to the report.\n\nNearly all the witnesses Orenic and Kato interviewed appeared extremely reliable but had a \u201cstrong desire to see something\u201d or an attitude of \u201cthought I\u2019d never see a saucer,\u201d the report states.\n\nThose attitudes, the extensive news coverage and prank launchings appeared to have caused wide-spread UFO sightings, the captains wrote.\n\nStill looking, still believing\n\nIn 2015, the year before Fisher\u2019s death at the age of 81, the Dispatch interviewed him about the incident. They asked how he felt about investigators pointing out his affinity for science fiction and \u201cstrong desire to see something\u201d \u2014 the report said, for example, that Fisher \u201cwatches the sky every chance he gets.\u201d\n\nThe former officer told the Dispatch he felt investigators were fishing for statements like that. But Fisher remained \u201cadamant that he saw what he saw,\u201d even years later.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what it was, but it most certainly wasn\u2019t a balloon,\u201d the Dispatch wrote. \u201cAnd several other people saw it and were startled by it, too.\u201d\n\nPetrick also stands by his story. He said he never read the conclusions of the Air Force, but he doesn\u2019t mind skepticism. Like Fisher, he knows what he saw.\n\n\u201cPeople believe in love,\u201d Petrick said. \u201cCan you prove it? Can you prove it\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also quick to point out that his interest in the UFO comes from a place of scientific curiosity, not opportunity. It\u2019s the bird that got away.\n\nPetrick jokes about his father, whose experience with the unknown was a little different. Milton Petrick lived in rural New Jersey when Orson Welles\u2019 \u201cWar of The Worlds\u201d went over the radio the night before Halloween in 1938. Milton and his buddies saw through the radio play\u2019s facade, but took it as a chance to improve the town.\n\n\u201cThey went down with their shotguns and rifles and shot the water tower, called the police and said, \u2018Yeah, we just killed a Martian,\u2019\u201d Petrick laughs. \u201cThey got their new water tower out of it.\u201d\n\nPetrick, though, isn\u2019t looking for a new water tower. He\u2019s just looking for answers. To this day, the 66-year-old scans the western sky almost daily, longing to see the UFO again. The uncertainty, though, is a sort of gift.\n\n\u201cEverybody has beliefs that they can't prove,\u201d Petrick said. \u201cWhich is actually a good thing, or life would be boring.\u201d\n\nWhile walking around the grounds of his old elementary school on a recent fall day, Petrick\u2019s voice rattled with a certain giddiness. He shuffled his feet along the sidewalk. Every time he found the perfect spot to recreate the memory, he\u2019d find an even better one a few inches over.\n\n\u201cNow it really hits home,\u201d Petrick said, aligning a triangle between the rightmost spire on the church steeple and the roof of the school.\n\nHe lingered in the neighborhood for about a half hour, in awe of the sky. Waiting, perhaps, for an answer to appear. The weather conditions were similar to those in 1967. The sky was clear and a seasonal chill lingered in the air.\n\nFor a moment, a plane flew overhead to the north. Petrick estimated it was about the same size as the UFO of 1967. The jet left contrails behind, but they faded after a few minutes.\n\nPetrick kept on looking, raising his hand to his forehead to block out the sun \u2014 a salute, of sorts, to the puzzling sky."

        "article_content": "An ex-Pentagon official, who gained fame for blowing the lid off a $22-million, secretive government UFO program, has revealed an image of an alleged UFO 'mothership.'\n\nLuis Elizondo, a career US Army counterintelligence specialist, previously ran the military's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.\n\nMonday night in Philadelphia at a private UFO event, Elizondo dropped what he described as a craft 'looking like the mothership from \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\"' referring to the 1977 Steven Spielberg film.\n\n'Guess what we caught in Romania in 2022? By the way, the US Embassy,' as Elizondo told attendees at the paid event, gesturing to the photo: 'That.'\n\nHe went on to describe it as a 'huge mini city floating in the sky.'\n\nBut the UFO, which resembles a gleaming disc-shaped craft, has already drawn withering critiques from skeptics, believers and even military UFO witnesses alike, who claim to have traced the photo to, not to the US Embassy, but a Facebook page.\n\nOne suggested to DailyMail.com that Elizondo has been lax in his vetting of such images in a bid to add sensational new material to his 'paid speaking engagements.'\n\nEx-Pentagon official Luis Elizondo (right), who gained fame for blowing the lid off a $22-million, secretive government UFO program, has revealed an image of a UFO 'mothership'\n\n'Guess what we caught in Romania in 2022?

'I witnessed him exaggerate or outright fabricate information that simply wasn't true.'\n\nElizondo unveiled the 2022 Romanian UFO photo at an October 28, 2024 event held at The City Winery, a wine bar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for $50-$30 per ticket.\n\n'There's a whole lot more here folks,' Elizondo told the audience in a leaked clip. 'I just want to give you kind of a small taste of what's going on \"behind the scenes.\"'\n\n'We're having pilots, military pilots and civilian pilots in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East, report what unimaginably seems impossible,' as Elizondo began to explain his 'real photo' of a UFO.\n\n'They described it literally 'the mothership,'' Elizondo said.\n\nBut despite credible federal reports of 'mothership' UFOs over domestic US military sites \u2014 investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), an FBI task force, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) and 16 local sheriff's offices \u2014 internet sleuths quickly managed to poke holes in Elizondo's 2022 Romanian UFO.\n\nJohn Greenewald Jr, a longtime government transparency advocate who runs The Black Vault, quickly tracked the photo back to a September 13, 2023 post in a Facebook group titled 'Mysterious Ancient Discoveries.'\n\nJohn Greenewald Jr, a longtime government transparency advocate who runs The Black Vault , quickly tracked the photo back to a September 13, 2023 post in a Facebook group titled ' Mysterious Ancient Discoveries' (above)\n\nThe higher resolution image of this apparent 'mothership,' which looks at first glance to be piercing clouds with its beatific shafts of light, appears more likely to have originated as the reflection of an indoor chandelier lamp reflected in window glass\n\n'I reverse imaged searched it,' Greenewald posted on X. 'It got more than 182,000 likes and more than 23,700 comments.'\n\nThe higher resolution image of this apparent 'mothership,' which looks at first glance to be piercing clouds with its beatific shafts of light, appears more likely to have originated as the reflection of an indoor chandelier lamp reflected in window glass.\n\nThe placement of Romania's coal-fired Arad Power Station indicates the image was not taken from the US Embassy, but a building near the Mure\u0219 River a few miles away.\n\nAmerica's Embassy in Romania is roughly 400 miles to the southeast of Arad, in the capital city of Bucharest.\n\nWhile dedicated UFO skeptics were eager to pounce on Elizondo's inaccurate claims, UFO enthusiasts also expressed frustration over the episode.\n\n'Lue is 100 percent using us as pawns to line his pockets,' one contributor to the Reddit forum r/UFOs lamented. 'His most recent book was no.1 seller in the nation.'\n\n'It's muddying the waters and detracting from the important convo,' another opined.\n\nBy midday Wednesday, Elizondo was publicly attributing the error to 'a friend in Government' who provided him with the photo 'a couple of years ago.'\n\nRetired USAF Staff Sergeant McGowan, however, told DailyMail.com that Elizondo's error was far from a one-off mistake.\n\n'I've been on the receiving end where Lue has pulled out his cell phone and shown me what he described as highly classified video,' McGowan told DailyMail.com.\n\nThe placement of Romania's coal-fired Arad Power Station (above) indicates the image was not taken from the US Embassy, but a building near the Mure\u0219 River a few miles away. America's Embassy in Romania is roughly 400 miles to the southeast of Arad, in Bucharest\n\n'For him to think I would believe he would simply carry classified info on an unsecure civilian cell phone is just insulting,' he added. 'And it wasn't just me, multiple podcast hosts were shown video Lue attributed to things they were not.'\n\nFor the past two years, McGowan has been notably public about this instance in which Elizondo showed him what he claimed was, in McGowan's words, 'a highly secret video smuggled out of Russia' taken by a Soviet Union probe near Mars.\n\nThe video, as McGowan recollected to DailyMail.com, looked to be a decades-old public UFO video from the Soviet's Phobos 2 probe, released by retired Soviet Air Force Colonel Marina Popovich in 1991.\n\nElizondo had shown the video to McGowan, in hushed tones, in January 2021.\n\nWhile Popovich, who wrote a book about her own UFO encounters as a test pilot, long maintained the Phobos 2 video depicted a legitimate alien craft, the odd video had nevertheless been public for about three decades, in other words.\n\n'There is a striking similarity between that public video and what Lue showed me on his phone,' McGowan recollected.\n\n'Only saw it for a few seconds,' he said, 'so the granular details didn't get absorbed.'\n\nMcGowan, whose duties in the Air Force included service in Desert Storm attached to Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and drug enforcement missions in Colombia, has been public for years on his own UFO encounter.\n\nIn the mid-90s, while serving as a member of the JSOC J2 Security Team for 'Ellipse Foxtrot,' Jeremy McGowan (above) says he was a witness to unusual aerial lights appearing to survey a highly classified cargo container he had been tasked with guarding in the desert\n\nFor the past two years, McGowan has been notably public about an instance in which Elizondo showed him what he claimed was, in McGowan's words, 'a highly secret video smuggled out of Russia' taken by a Soviet probe near Mars. The video however had been public since 1991\n\nIn the mid-90s, while serving as a member of the JSOC J2 Security Team for 'Ellipse Foxtrot,' McGowan says he was a witness to unusual aerial lights appearing to survey a highly classified cargo container he had been tasked with guarding in the desert.\n\nHe spoke to the History Channel about this UFO sighting in the Mid East for the 2020 docu-series 'Unidentified,' which had been hosted by Luis Elizondo.\n\nAs McGowan recollected about his appearance on the show in a Medium blog post, he had agreed to this on-camera interview in the hopes of getting back in touch with other witnesses to the event, but felt 'used' by the experience.\n\n'I was supposed to be introduced to investigators and researchers who could help me identify the person with me on that dune and saw what I saw!' he wrote in 2022.\n\n'I left with no answers [...] I sent a few emails to production that were ignored, and I was never extended the courtesy promised to me.'\n\nBy midday Wednesday, Elizondo was publicly attributing the error to 'a friend in Government' who provided him with the photo 'a couple of years ago' (above)\n\nElizondo unveiled the 2022 Romanian UFO photo at an October 28, 2004 event held at The City Winery, a wine bar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , for $50-$30 per ticket\n\nFederal government concern about 'mothership' UFOs harboring swarms of 'drones,' have spilled out into public view following the release of internal reports via the US Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in recent years.\n\nWeeks of reports of mystery 'drones' swept eastern Colorado and nearby areas of Nebraska, Wyoming and Kansas over the winter holidays of 2019 into the new year.\n\nThe sightings worried citizens and local law enforcement alike, but odd craft and thier 'motherships' troubled the US military especially for their proximity to some of America's sensitive, nuclear-equipped intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).\n\n'They all seem clustered in an area that has quite a few Minuteman sites,' a redacted official confessed in one email released via FOIA by F.E. Warren Air Force Base.\n\nF.E. Warren security staff spoke to local sheriff's deputies who ' reported seeing a 'mothership' six feet in diameter flanked by 10 smaller drones (some fixed wing, some not).'\n\n'When deputies follow the drones, they clock them at speeds of 60-70 mph,' the redacted base official stated."

        "article_content": "There was no sound to begin with, just an eerie shape, looming in from the distance. Some say it looked like a giant silver cigar, others a flying saucer, a metallic disc, shimmering overhead.\n\nAs the craft slowed to a hover above Westall High School, the children in the playground started screaming. One of the eyewitnesses, Mary Eastwood, said it felt like 'the end of the world'. Students were running around, hysterical, or throwing themselves to the ground in panic. Mary and her friend sat on the perimeter fence, dumbstruck.\n\nThe only thing we know for sure almost 60 years later is that something strange and unnerving happened at the school, just south-east of Melbourne, on an April morning in 1966. Official efforts to dismiss the eye-witness reports by insisting the 'craft' was nothing more than a stray weather balloon have never quite succeeded and a secret government report into the incident has never been released.\n\nIndeed, that explosive report - authored by a high-ranking aviation official - is believed to rubbish the official explanation that the mysterious object was a high-altitude balloon.\n\nSo, it is no surprise that many of the people at Westall that day \u2013 students, teachers and residents of nearby Clayton South \u2013 resolutely believe what they saw was an alien spacecraft, a UFO. And now, even more astonishingly, a leading UFO investigator says what they actually encountered might have been a captured alien craft deployed as part of secret U.S. military tests.\n\nAuthor Ross Coulthart has spent decades investigating the Westall incident and is convinced the truth has been deliberately covered up.\n\nThe key to the mystery lies in the secret official report into Australia's most significant mass sighting of an unidentified craft which is still buried away in the bowels of the Department of Defence archives.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the document, it was compiled in 1967 by an engineer - known only as 'Mr X' - who was working as the Assistant Controller of the Aircraft, Guided Weapons and Electronics Supply Division of the government's now-defunct Department of Supply.\n\nLeading UFO investigator Ross Coulthart claims the truth about the Westall incident has been deliberately covered up, with a secret official report into Australia's most significant mass sighting still buried away in the bowels of the Department of Defence archives\n\nA purported photograph of the Westall UFO incident, in which almost 200 students, teachers and residents in south-east Melbourne claimed to have witnessed an unexplained flying object hovering near a suburban school before descending onto a nearby open field in 1966\n\nA newspaper clipping outlining what several witnesses saw on that fateful day in 1966\n\nCoulthart claims only two copies of the 'Westall Papers' were ever made. One was destroyed by Mr X's widow on his orders after his death, while the other remains hidden from public sight.\n\n'One of the things that happened in the wake of the Westall incident was that an official, who was very senior in Australian aviation, was retained by Defence to write an investigation into what took place that day,' Coulthart tells Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'He's since died... but I have spoken with the son of the man who wrote the report.\n\n'He says his father worked on the report in the family home and that he became aware as a child of the fact that his dad was travelling to the Westall school for three or four days in a row in what became an extraordinarily intense investigation.\n\n'And his father was so freaked out by what he discovered \u2013 the implications of what he learned \u2013 that he gave a secret copy of the Westall Papers to his wife and told her to keep it hidden away in a particular location in the family home.\n\n'He made her promise she would destroy it when he died but, essentially, that was his insurance policy.\n\n'Mr X's son doesn't know what was precisely revealed in that document, but he does have a strong recollection of his father's position on the Westall incident, and believes the truth went well beyond the simple spy balloon explanation.\n\n'He watched his mother burn the report in their back garden after his father died but there is another copy that was the filed with the Department of Supply.'\n\nCoulthart, a five-times Walkley Award-winning investigative journalist, says the mystery file was transferred to the Defence archives after the Department of Supply was dissolved in June 1974.\n\nINTELLIGENTLY CONTROLLED CRAFT\n\nAndrew Greenwood was a teacher at Westall High School when the unexplained incident occurred \u2013 and says he was later threatened into silence.\n\nHe vividly recalls a 'hysterical' student running into his Year 9 science class during first break, claiming there was a flying saucer in the sky. While dubious at first, Mr Greenwood nonetheless went outside and was shocked to see a bright silver object 'the size of a car' hovering in the air near the school.\n\nHe said the object began to slowly rise into the sky before it was approached by five aircraft. Whenever these aircraft drew close to the silver object, it quickly darted in a different direction before stopping again.\n\nThe cat-and-mouse encounter continued for about 20 minutes before the object landed briefly in a nearby field - known as the Grange Reserve - then shot away and vanished into the sky entirely.\n\nAndrew Greenwood, one of the teachers at Westall High School during the UFO encounter, has described a frightening visit he received from government officials demanding he keep quiet\n\nTerry Peck, who was a student at Westall, shows former 60 Minutes investigative reporter Ross Coulthart a series of drawings of what she saw hovering above her school in April 1966\n\nWithin 40 minutes, air force and army personnel poured into the area in military vehicles and formed a secure barrier around the reserve. But, knowing the area well, Mr Greenwood and dozens of students were able to sneak in and see what was going on.\n\n'[We saw a] circular area, like trampled grass,' Mr Greenwood says. 'And there were guards around it and there were people in there with equipment.'\n\nMr Greenwood remains convinced the object he witnessed was an alien aircraft.\n\n'I saw a craft. A mechanical object intelligently controlled hovering above me,' he told Coulthart in The Phenomenon, a documentary released in 2022.\n\nHe added that after discussing the incident with local news reporters, Mr Greenwood received an unexpected \u2013 and unwelcome \u2013 late-night visit at his home from two men claiming to be government officials.\n\nAccording to him, one was wearing plain clothes and the other a high-ranking air force uniform. They told him his recollection of the incident was incorrect - and he would be well advised to stop talking about the encounter.\n\n'When I tried to explain to them that they weren't there - I was - and I knew what I saw, well, the first suggestion was, 'You'd be ill-advised to go on saying that because clearly you were drunk on duty and will have to be reported to the education department and of course you will lose your job',' he says.\n\n'Absolutely, I was threatened. I was told that I should not say anything.'\n\nHe believes the intimidating visit was part of a government conspiracy to cover up the country's largest mass UFO encounter.\n\nEYEWITNESSES THREATENED\n\nOne oft-reported explanation for the Westall incident is that the object could have been a runaway high-altitude atmospheric balloon from the HIBAL program at Mildura Airport, about a six-hour drive away in Victoria's north-west.\n\nThe program was established by Australia's Department of Supply in conjunction with the US Atomic Energy Commission in 1960. It purportedly used white and silver high-altitude balloons to sample the levels of radioactive elements injected into the stratosphere by atomic experiments in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSome sceptics have suggested the object spotted hovering over the Westall school in 1966 was a runaway high-altitude atmospheric balloon from Mildura Airport about six hours away\n\nBut Coulthart - who has led investigations across ABC's Four Corners, Nine's 60 Minutes and Seven's Sunday Night flagship news and current affairs programs - is convinced there is a more sinister explanation.\n\n'Andrew's account is extraordinarily credible,' Coulthart tells Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'And he's adamant that what he saw was something anomalous that he couldn't explain away as a balloon or anything like that.\n\n'In fact, he says categorically that it was not a balloon of any kind whatsoever, that it was clearly some kind of craft.\n\n'He says he saw an elliptical, metallic disc-shaped object moving in some intelligent way.\n\n'And he's not the only one. There are well over 180 witnesses who saw the exact same thing - people like Terry Peck, who has a particularly vivid memory of what she saw, and who is equally adamant 'it was not a balloon'.\n\nPeck, a former student at Westall, provided Coulthart with a series of drawings of what she saw hovering above her school.\n\nRecounting that fateful April day, she claimed she jumped over the school fence and raced towards where the UFO had landed in the pines.\n\nBy the time she arrived, two other classmates were already there. One of them, a girl, was hysterical. Peck alleges the student was carried off in an ambulance and never came back to school.\n\nWhat happened next still troubles her.\n\n'We all got called to an assembly... and they told us all to keep quiet,' she says.\n\n'I know this sounds corny, but I know what I saw. It was not a balloon. It was a machine, a craft.'\n\n'I'd absolutely just like someone to come forward from the services just to say, \"Yes, it did happen, and it landed and there was a cover-up\".'\n\nCoulthart says he has since spoken to multiple people who attended the assembly who all shared the same story.\n\n'They all describe how there were officials from the government and people in uniform who were standing up the back of the hall who were listening to what was being said to the students,' he says.\n\nAnd it wasn't only the students being warned.\n\n'We've spoken to firemen who attended the incident, and numerous people who were told - threatened - that if they talked about this, this was a national security issue, and that they should shut up about it,' Coulthart says.\n\nFive-time Walkley Award-winning journalist Ross Coulthart vows he will continue investigating the 'non-human technology' involved in encounters such as the Westall mass sighting despite ongoing attempts to discredit anyone who speaks out about the 'biggest story in history'\n\n'Moreover, when the recovery operation happened, there were American-accented personnel driving American left-hand-drive jeeps.\n\n'So, it's just absurd to try to patronise these witnesses by saying, 'You don't know what you saw, it was just a spy or weather balloon'. That's bollocks, absolute rubbish.'\n\nPUBLIC LEFT IN DARK\n\nCoulthart has spent years pushing for the Westall Papers to be made public, but fears they may remain locked away in the Defence Department forever. In the absence of the full report, he has been able to assemble only tantalising pieces of the jigsaw.\n\n'Certainly, there was detailed analysis that was done: soils removed, there were radiation detectors used, Geiger counters used,' Coulthart says.\n\n'It was the most extraordinarily intense investigation and the public has been completely left in the dark.\n\n'I suspect there was a finding [in the Westall Papers] that the object was American technology. I am convinced the Americans have been using Australia as a secret location for testing of technology - non-human technology - that became too sensitive to test in places like Area 51, the Nevada Test Range.\n\n'There's been an ongoing Cold War between the Russians, the Chinese and the Americans over who gets access to this retrieved, non-human technology - and fighting for the knowledge of how to use it and how to develop and replicate it.\n\n'We've moved beyond the argument about whether these things are real. It's been formally admitted that they're real.\n\n'What we have now is a continuing attempt at a feeble cover-up by the Pentagon and the intelligence community, which, I suspect, believes that it can derive some kind of hegemonical American military advantage from the technology that it is hiding.\n\n'That is why the public is being lied to about incidents like Westall, and why this is being concealed.'\n\nTHE ROAD AHEAD\n\nThe Westall sighting has become one of the most enduring of Australian mysteries.\n\nThe incident has not only featured in a raft of popular documentaries, but has also been commemorated at the site itself with a UFO-themed playground.\n\nHIBAL balloons were used to sample the levels of radioactive elements in the atmosphere\n\nOfficially, the Department of Defence insists it is 'not aware' of the existence of the Westall Papers and critics continue to dismiss Coulthart's work. However, the investigator says that despite the passage of time, he will continue to push for the release of Mr X's secret report.\n\n'I have been vilified and attacked for investigating the technology involved in these kinds of encounters,' he tells me.\n\n'Numerous people I have spoken to have told me it is routine for people who are working inside this secret program to be intimidated and threatened with death if they reveal what they know.\n\n'But there is no amount of intimidation or bullying or threats that will stop me from investigating this. It's too far down the track.\n\n'This is the biggest story in human history, and I know it's real.'"

During an October 2023 episode of Hello!\u2019s \u201cA Right Royal Podcast,\u201d Felix claimed that William, 42, had a cheeky reply when he was told the ghost of a Catholic priest lives in Anmer Hall, his and wife Princess Kate Middleton\u2018s country home.\n\nRelated: King Charles Is Giving the Public Unprecedented Access to Balmoral Castle A piece of royal history has been made public for the first time. King Charles III is opening the doors to Scotland\u2019s Balmoral Castle, a storied estate that serves as a frequent vacation spot for the royal family. \u201cFor the first time since the castle was completed in 1855, we have been granted permission to [\u2026]\n\n\u201cBefore the Waleses moved in, they were warned about the ghost and the comment was \u2014 I presume it was from Prince William \u2014 \u2018No old hall would be complete without a ghost, would it?\u2019\u201d Felix claimed.\n\nHe added that the late priest\u2019s ghost has been seen and heard in Anmer Hall, and noted that the priest died after being \u201changed, drawn and quartered for high treason.\u201d\n\nHarry, 40, meanwhile, wrote in his 2023 memoir, Spare, that he once sought help from a woman who \u201cclaimed to have \u2018powers\u2019\u201d to connect with his late mother, Princess Diana, who died in a car crash at age 36 in 1997. Harry was 12 at the time.\n\n\u201c\u2019Your mother says that you are living the life that she couldn\u2019t live,\u2019\u201d Harry recalled the woman telling him. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re living the life she wanted for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: Prince Harry Stayed at Diana's Childhood Home for Recent UK Trip: Report Prince Harry reportedly stayed at the home of his late mother, Princess Diana, while visiting the U.K. for his uncle Lord Robert Fellowes\u2019 funeral. Harry, 39, was apparently the guest of his uncle Charles Spencer at Althorp House \u2014 where Diana grew up \u2014 late last month, People reported on Monday, September 2. The Duke of [\u2026]\n\nThe Duke of Sussex isn\u2019t the only royal who has sought messages from a deceased loved one. The King of UFOs doc claimed that Queen Elizabeth II attended a seance in 1953 hoping to connect with her then-recently deceased father. The queen\u2019s mother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, sister, Princess Margaret, and husband, Prince Philip, were also reportedly in attendance.\n\nThe royal family\u2019s interest in the paranormal is often attributed to Queen Victoria, who was Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s great-great-grandmother. In his 2013 book Whisperers: The Secret History of the Spirit World, occult expert J.H. Brennan claimed that Victoria, who reigned from 1837 to 1901, was \u201cfascinated by spiritualism\u201d and would invite mediums to Buckingham Palace and \u201chold seances.\u201d\n\nBrennan also claimed that Victoria\u2019s manservant John Brown, whom she was rumored to have a romantic relationship with, actually acted as a medium to help her channel the spirit of her beloved late husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nRelated: Princess Diana\u2019s Brother Pays Tribute on 27th Anniversary of Her Death The People\u2019s Princess always and forever. The British royal family has kept Princess Diana\u2019s memory alive since her untimely death in August 1997. The mother of Prince William and Prince Harry died at the age of 36 after a car accident in Paris that resulted from her driver, Henri Paul, fleeing the paparazzi. Paul and [\u2026]\n\nVictoria died at age 81 in 1901, which meant she spent decades without Albert, who died at age 42 in 1861.\n\nWhile the royal family\u2019s history with spirits might be a little too spooky for some, Felix said in The King of UFOs that the royals \u201clive with their ghosts because most people do.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost people aren\u2019t afraid of ghosts when they are in their houses,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey just accept them.\u201d\n\nThe King of UFOs is now streaming on Tube and Amazon Prime Video."

        "article_content": "What if?\n\nThat\u2019s the question that plagues you when you think about the paranormal. Ghosts aren\u2019t real. They can\u2019t be. That shadow out of the corner of your eye is a trick of the light. Those unexplained noises are the house shifting. Right?\n\nBut what if?\n\nYou can drive yourself crazy wondering. Or you can do something about it and try to prove the unprovable.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Montana Paranormal Research Society (MTPRS) comes in. For two decades the group has searched for specters \u2014 and the evidence they may or may not have left behind \u2014 in and around Montana. They are this state\u2019s foremost experts in the paranormal.\n\nThe group\u2019s numbers have fluctuated over the years, but there are three core members of MTPRS. Dustin is the organization\u2019s founder and erstwhile leader. Married couple Lora and Curtis are sort of the ying and the yang of this whole organization. She has boundless enthusiasm, his favorite moments are when he can prove some piece of evidence they\u2019ve gathered has a rational explanation. (The trio requested that their full names and photos not be used for this story).\n\nIn the late 1990s, Dustin was a computer tech at Bozeman Public Schools. The district\u2019s headquarters are in Willson School, on West Main in downtown Bozeman. The former high school was completed in 1937 but sections of it were built starting in 1902.\n\nDustin and a friend would stay late after hours to play \u201cWorld of Warcraft,\u201d since the school district had a better internet connection than their home did.\n\n\u201cI was locking up one night and every other light in the hallway was on, and there was someone down at the very end of the hallway,\u201d he remembered. \u201cIt looked like a kid.\u201d\n\nBy the time he had the door unlocked and went down the hallway to investigate, the figure was gone. So he pushed it aside, until a month or so later. Someone put up an exhibit with photos of students who had attended the school. They were wearing identical uniforms to the figure Dustin saw in the hallway.\n\n\u201cThat got me started on the whole concept of what\u2019s going on out there,\u201d he said. He started playing around with photography, trying to capture some evidence of what he\u2019d seen. For years, he just captured dust balls floating around.\n\nBut after a move back to Billings in 2001, Dustin got a job at the old Carmike 7 movie theater on Overland Avenue. Theaters, which are big wide-open buildings kept artificially dark, are spooky places, and Dustin started hearing stories. So to investigate more, he started carrying a video camera around while working.\n\nOne day, the district manager came by, furiously asserting that someone at the theater had been pirating movies. Coming clean about the whole thing didn\u2019t really help.\n\n\u201cHe was jumping up and down yelling at me saying, \u2018I am not calling corporate offices and saying that you were hunting for ghosts,\u2019\u201d Dustin said. \u201cIt would have been better if I\u2019d said I was pirating movies.\u201d\n\nDustin got to keep this job, but he figured he should probably get a group together to add some legitimacy to this whole thing, and the Montana Paranormal Research Society was born. At first they were just friends from the movie theater, but they started growing. Lora and Curtis joined around 2008, after hearing the group being interviewed on the radio.\n\nThe group investigate historic hauntings, but their bread and butter is working with average folks who have something happening to them that they can\u2019t explain. MTPRS members are all volunteers, and they\u2019ve never accepted anything more than gas money from folks who\u2019ve asked them to investigate.\n\n\u201cWe try to help people,\u201d Dustin explained. They might not be able to solve what\u2019s going on, but they can at least try to capture it, to validate the activity. Most people learn to live with the activity, treating it as a sort of quirk of their house.\n\nFor years, they took on every case that walked through the door. Dustin has seen a lot, and there are a few instances that still rattle him. He\u2019s been tapped on the shoulder at the Moss Mansion, and on an investigation in Pryor he was confronted by a seven-foot-tall black mass.\n\nBut for the most part, they\u2019ve gotten in more trouble with the people they\u2019re working with, not the spirits.\n\nMTPRS are affiliated with TAPS (the Atlantic Paranormal Society), the group featured on the wildly popular and long-running Travel Channel show \u201cGhost Hunters,\u201d but their investigations don\u2019t really look like anything you\u2019ll see on TV. There\u2019s no shouting at or taunting of spirits. Rather, they try to be respectful or even helpful, hoping to draw more spectral flies with honey rather than vinegar.\n\nTheir rules are simple. Number one is safety. Number two, Dustin joked, is to not break anything in the Moss Mansion.\n\nThe approach seems to have worked. MTPRS have a mountain of evidence from their two decades of work. There are a few photos \u2014 one that shows a unexplained figure at the Dude Rancher Lodge in Billings \u2014 and some videos, but the cameras are mostly to keep track of the investigators. The bulk of their material comes in the form of electronic voice phenomenon.\n\nEVPs, as they\u2019re known in the ghost hunting world, are disembodied voices mysteriously caught on electronic recorders. Often the investigator handing the recorders don\u2019t even know they\u2019ve got something until they listen back.\n\nMTPRS have a few of note. One was captured on the eighth floor of the Yellowstone County Courthouse, which used to be the county\u2019s jail. It features a worried, British accented voice saying, \u201cHere comes Mr. Becker.\u201d Per legend, that was the name of a former guard.\n\nLater on in the clip, which is available on YouTube, Lora did something she never does: talked back.\n\n\u201cDo you know that you\u2019re dead and you don\u2019t have to stay here anymore,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201c(Expletive) you!\u201d a voice shot back.\n\nListening to it now, it almost sounds fun, like a call and response from beyond the grave. But this stuff isn\u2019t easy. Investigations can get monotonous and boring, and that\u2019s only the beginning. Once you\u2019re done, you\u2019ve got hours of videos and audio recordings to listen to. In the group\u2019s early days, Dustin would hold evidence parties, where everyone would try to comb through all the material over pizza. They\u2019ve had members quit once they realize how much work is involved.\n\nThey\u2019ve investigated buildings all over, many they can\u2019t even speak about. The locations they can reveal are a cavalcade of historic Montana places. The group has always been based in Billings, so their usual haunts are the Moss Mansion, the Dude Rancher and the old Parmly Billings Library building (now the Western Heritage Center).\n\nThey investigated the Mammoth Hot Springs General Store in Yellowstone. That building, which was built in 1895 as part of Fort Yellowstone, had so much activity going on that employees reached out to MTPRS specifically. As far as Dustin knows, they\u2019re the only group who have hunted for ghosts in a national park.\n\nThey\u2019ve been all over, from the aptly named Ghost Rails Inn in Alberton to the Miles City Elks Lodge.\n\nIt was at the Elks that MTPRS captured what Dustin thinks is the best piece of evidence they\u2019ve found. On a night in September 2010, they captured what sounds like a woman screaming. She can be heard from different microphones all around the building, and none of the investigators heard a sound.\n\nIs there a natural explanation, or is this a call from the other side? Nobody can say for sure. The clip is on YouTube, so you can judge for yourself. There are no answers here, just mysteries that prompt more and more mysteries.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why Dustin takes such a pragmatic view on the paranormal. He doesn\u2019t even like the word \u201chaunted.\u201d He can\u2019t say for sure what any of this activity is, but he can\u2019t explain it.\n\n\u201cWhen it gets down to it, we just don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it dead Aunt Marge who\u2019s talking to you? Or is it a manifestation of your brain?\u201d\n\nWhen Jesus walks on water in the Book of Matthew, the disciples initially cower in fear, believing him to be a ghost. For pretty much always, people have been using the paranormal to explain the unexplainable.\n\nAs far as Dustin has seen, there\u2019s nothing truly evil out there. Just things you can\u2019t quite understand. And maybe they\u2019re looking back at us, also searching for connection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a noble thing to help out where we can,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cEven if we can\u2019t find what\u2019s out there.\u201d"

For more information on Western Idaho Paranormal click here.\n\n(Below is the transcript from the broadcast story)\n\nOne year ago I took you on a Halloween adventure through Haunted World. but this season I wanted to experience a true haunt. I'm your neighborhood reporter Alexander Huddleston and some coworkers and I went on an investigation with Western Idaho Paranormal here at the Requiem in Caldwell.\n\nRELATED: Haunted World still keeping Caldwell spooky.\n\n\"98 percent of investigations are you staring at each other in the dark. You ask questions, you wait for answers,\" said Jennifer Ward, the marketing director for Western Idaho Paranormal.\n\nWard continued, \"Sometimes you get those golden moments where you audibly hear something or you see something out of the corner of your eye and catch it on camera.\"\n\nIt was a hot August night in Caldwell, as I mentally prepared for one of the scariest experiences of my life.\n\nSpeaking with Requiem owner Krista Brower-Wood, she laughed saying, \"We have people tell us they have seen the little boy on the third floor and the old man on the third floor. There is Alyssa on the third floor. She is a lady in white and she hangs out here. There is a doctor down here.\"\n\n\"Down in the basement, we were all sitting down there and within the first five minutes we started playing with the K2 meter, and we started doing an EVP (electronic voice phenomena) session. Per the client, they stated there is a spirit of a doctor downstairs, and when questioning that doctor we immediately got hits. We got very strong hits and they went away. I've been doing this for over a decade, but a good solid K2 meter where they answer you immediately, I have had happen one time,\" explained Western Idaho Paranormal operations manager, Pete Kruger.\n\nHaving watched hours and hours of paranormal investigations myself, there was one method I've always wanted to try and personally requested we did.\n\nKruger went on saying, \"We did that modified EVP session with the Estes Method where you wore a blindfold and had your head stuffed with a spirit box. While I do not put a lot of credence into it and have given an entire presentation on why spirit boxes are junk, the fact that you were able to answer questions without hearing us, without seeing us, was interesting. That has only happened one time.\"\n\nNow having been on both sides, watching investigations might be fun and creepy, but let me tell you it does not even come close to being there for the experience."

        "article_content": "When it comes to antivirus software, small business\u2019 needs often fall in an in-between space: Personal antivirus tools such as McAfee or Kaspersky may not be robust enough, while enterprise solutions are too complicated and expensive. Fortunately, there are antivirus solutions tailored to the needs of smaller companies, so we\u2019ve rounded up our six top choices of the best antivirus software for small businesses.\n\nTop antivirus software for small businesses comparison\n\nBesides price, there are many other factors to consider when choosing the best small business antivirus software. A few of them are summarized in the table below:\n\nStarting price Free trial Devices covered VPN included Password manager included Bitdefender $104.99 for 5 devices for 1 year Yes macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, Windows Server Yes Yes Norton $59.99 a year for 6 devices for 1 year Yes Windows, macOS, iOS, Android Premium plan only Yes Trend Micro Contact for pricing Yes Windows, macOS, iOS, Android No No ESET $179.99 for 5 devices for 1 year Yes Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux Certain plans only Certain plans only Avira $59.99 for 5 devices for 1 year Yes Windows, macOS, iOS, Android Yes Yes Microsoft Defender $33.75 per user per month Yes Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android No No\n\nBitdefender GravityZone: Best overall Bitdefender is known for its consumer-facing antivirus software, but it also offers excellent antivirus solutions for small businesses. Bitdefender can protect macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, and Windows Server systems, making it a good choice for SMBs that use multiple types of devices. The dashboard makes it easy to manage your security even if you don\u2019t have advanced IT training. Some plans also offer unlimited VPN traffic and account breach monitoring for everyone on the plan. SEE: How to Create an Effective Cybersecurity Awareness Program (TechRepublic Premium) Why I chose Bitdefender GravityZone I chose Bitdefender GravityZone because of its ease of use and excellent reputation. I also appreciate the many pricing options it offers. You can opt to pay per the number of devices or the number of users, so that you aren\u2019t paying for extra slots you\u2019re not using. If and when you\u2019re ready to scale, Bitdefender also offers security solutions and managed services for mid-sized businesses, so you might not even have to switch providers. Pricing Small Business Security: Starts at $104.99 for 5 devices for 1 year.\n\nStarts at $104.99 for 5 devices for 1 year. Business Security: Starts at $129.49 for 5 devices for 1 year.\n\nStarts at $129.49 for 5 devices for 1 year.

Visit Bitdefender\n\nFeatures\n\nRisk management capabilities.\n\nScam Copilot feature powered by AI.\n\nFileless attack protection.\n\nBuilt-in password management and digital identity monitoring.\n\nDedicated email protection.\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros Cons Centralized security dashboard. Price plans can be confusing to navigate. Scores well in independent testing. Monthly payment option not available for all plans. User interface is intuitive and relatively easy to navigate. Scales with businesses as they grow.\n\nNorton: Best for 24/7 customer support At a small business, you rarely work defined hours, which is why it\u2019s important to choose antivirus software that offers extensive support options. Fortunately, Norton offers online chat support 24/7 for English-speaking customers. There\u2019s also a large knowledge base that you can consult for self-help before reaching out to customer service. Norton\u2019s small business plans bundle together many features, including password management and cloud backup. Why I chose Norton I chose Norton because it offers 24/7 customer support in addition to an all-in-one security platform. It\u2019s not big enough to scale with your business the way some other options on the list can, but it\u2019s a great option if you\u2019re a true small business that needs to protect 20 devices and under. Pricing Norton Small Business: Starts at $59.99 a year for 6 devices.\n\nStarts at $59.99 a year for 6 devices. Norton Small Business Premium: Starts at $149.99 a year for 10 devices. Visit Norton\n\nFeatures\n\nSecure browser protects internet traffic.\n\nEncrypted vault for storing login info.\n\nAutomatic software update tool.\n\nPC cleaner and optimizer.\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros Cons Affordable promotional pricing for the first years. Must upgrade to a more expensive plan to get a VPN. Can monitor up to 5 contacts for identity theft and breaches. Cloud storage is limited on both plans. Automatically backs up crucial business data. 24/7 chat support is available in English only. Includes Windows PC cleaning, updating, and optimizing.\n\nTrend Micro: Best for endpoint protection Trend Micro is excellent at detecting and defending against cyberattacks, which is why I named it one of the best antivirus software for Windows. Trend Micro offers two tiers of software: Trend Vision One for Small Businesses, and Trend Vision One for larger companies. The small business version can protect not just endpoints but also workloads and cloud apps as well with both endpoint detection response and extended detection response. Why I chose Trend Micro I selected Trend Micro because of its multiple cyber threat tools that promote early detection and elimination. I also appreciate that its many plans can scale with a small business as it becomes a midsize business or even a large enterprise. It also offers managed services through partnerships with third-party providers if you\u2019re interested in outsourcing your IT work. Pricing Trend Micro does not disclose the pricing information for Trend Vision One for Small Businesses or Trend Vision One. Contact the sales team to get a customized quote. Visit Trend Micro\n\nFeatures\n\nAttack surface risk management.\n\nAI threat intelligence tools.\n\nData protection supports regulatory compliance.\n\nAdvanced email security and mobile device security.\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros Cons Wide variety of apps for threat detection and prevention. Pricing is not transparent. Educational tutorials are available. Number of features can be overwhelming to navigate. Can scale with your business as it grows. Ability to run simulated attacks on endpoints.\n\nESET: Best for scalability ESET is antivirus software for small businesses that offers five different pricing plans to choose from. This gives growing businesses a lot of runway to upgrade as their cybersecurity needs grow. A handful of add-ons increases the flexibility of the pricing tiers even further. Even the entry-level plan covers all types of endpoints and device control, while upper tier plans have additional features such as full disk encryption and patch management. Why I chose ESET I picked ESET because the platform offers four pricing plans and three add-ons for small and medium-sized businesses, giving companies lots of flexibility to scale as they grow. It\u2019s also relatively easy to manage \u2014 though you\u2019ll want a dedicated IT administrator to fully take advantage of the cybersecurity features offered by the more expensive plans. Pricing ESET Small Business Security: Starts at $179.99 for one year with 5 devices.\n\nStarts at $179.99 for one year with 5 devices. ESET Protect Entry: Starts at $211.00 for one year with 5 devices.\n\nStarts at $211.00 for one year with 5 devices.

Small business plan limited to 25 devices. Multilingual customer support available. Certain features like MFA require an additional paid add-on. Many pricing plans means the software can scale as your business grows.\n\nAvira: Best for affordability If you\u2019re a small business owner who needs to cover lots of devices at a reasonable cost, check out Avira Prime. This small business antivirus software only charges $134.99 per year for up to 25 devices, which costs about the same (or less!) than what many competitors charge for 5-10 devices. The bundle also includes an unlimited VPN, a password manager, and a device cleaner, so you\u2019re getting more than just antivirus software at that price. If you need an even lower cost option, then check out our list of the best free endpoint detection software. Why I chose Avira I opted for Avira because it offers one of the most affordable pricing plans, allowing small businesses owners to protect up to 25 devices at a decent cost. I also like that it bundles additional features into its plan, like a VPN, instead of breaking them off into separate paid add-ons like some competitors. Pricing Avira Prime for 5 devices: $59.99 for the first year, or $9.99 per month.\n\n$59.99 for the first year, or $9.99 per month. Avira Prime for 25 devices: $139.99 for one year, or $12.99 per month. Visit Avira\n\nFeatures\n\nBlocks unwanted spam callers on smartphones.\n\nUnlimited VPN traffic allowed.\n\nAutomatically updates software on Windows devices.\n\nDevice cleaner and privacy settings manager for PCs.\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros Cons Offers tools to improve security, privacy, and performance. Only two pricing tiers to choose from. Unlimited VPN included. Jump from 5 to 25 devices may not work for all SMBs. Device cleaner gets rid of junk files on PCs. Block trackers and adware while internet browsing.\n\nMicrosoft Defender: Best for Windows-only systems If your small business only uses Windows devices, then Microsoft Defender may be sufficient for your basic antivirus needs. In fact, Defender already comes built into Windows 11 and 12, and you can even get it bundled in with other Microsoft apps like Word and Excel through the 365 E3 and E5 software packages. While you can use Defender on other types of operating systems and devices, such as Macs and iPhones, you\u2019ll probably find it easier to set up other options on this list on non-Windows endpoints. Why I chose Microsoft Defender I chose Microsoft Defender because it\u2019s often the most seamless option for small businesses that only use the Windows operating system. If you opt for one of the 365 E5 software bundles, you\u2019ll get Defender alongside your other Microsoft apps, so you don\u2019t even have to set up a separate subscription. Pricing Microsoft 365 E3: $33.75 per user, per month; Windows for Enterprise, 1TB of cloud storage and MDE P1.\n\n$33.75 per user, per month; Windows for Enterprise, 1TB of cloud storage and MDE P1. Microsoft 365 E5: $54.75 per user, per month; all 365 E3 features plus advanced security and compliance capabilities; business analytics and MDE P2. Visit Microsoft Defender\n\nFeatures\n\nAutomatic disruption of ransomware attacks.\n\nSecure Score offers prioritized security recommendations.\n\nGlobal threat intelligence and reporting.\n\nCopilot AI feature now available for security solutions, including Defender.\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros Cons Built into Windows 10 and 11. Pricing plans are difficult to navigate. Often bundled together with other Microsoft tools. Lacks advanced protection and features of competitors. Integrates with other security solutions from Microsoft.\n\nHow do I choose the best antivirus software for my small business?\n\nTo choose the best small business antivirus software, first consider your needs as well as your budget. Bear in mind that bundled plans that include additional features (such as a VPN and password manager) may save you more money in the long run than purchasing each tool \u00e0 la carte. Use your budget and must-have features to narrow down your options to a shortlist, or start with the six platforms listed here.\n\nThen it\u2019s time to take advantage of free trials so that you can test the software for yourself. I always strongly recommend hands-on testing of the software before committing to an annual contract. You should also schedule demo calls with the sales team if you have additional questions during or after the trial.\n\nIf you still aren\u2019t certain about your choice of antivirus software, then you might want to try a platform that offers a month-to-month option, such as Avira and Bitdefender. That way, you aren\u2019t locked into a year-long contract if you ultimately decide to change your mind.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo choose the best small business antivirus software, I consulted product documentation and users reviews. I considered features such as endpoint protection options, phishing and anti-malware measures, included VPNs and password managers, and automatic software updates. I also weighed other factors such as price plans, scalability, free trials, customer service available, ease of use, and user interface design."
