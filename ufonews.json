            "article_content": "Bright orange 'UFO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City,' raising concern among residents of the Big Apple over the holiday week.\n\nOn Friday, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted the video to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nUsers local to the New York City area confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nOther users deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious, and was shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "\n\n\n\nThe US Congress has been attempting to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs - as our maps show the places in the UK and America most likely to be visited by extra-terrestrials.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023. That was a 20% drop from 497 UFO sightings in 2022 and also lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484).\n\nIt found that people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39).\n\nREAD MORE: The Saturday night when 85 cows thundered through a Somerset town\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: Gorgeous Somerset cafe which perfects cake for the kids and coffee for the parents\n\nYou can see what UFO encounters have been reported where you live using our interactive map.\n\n\n\n\n\nSightings documented in the UK included:\n\n\n\nA \u201clong cigar-shaped craft with three or four roundish patterns on it\u201d was observed for 20 minutes before it \u201cvanished like a light being switched off\u201d above Chester in Cheshire in October last year.\n\nA \u201crocket-type object\u201d was spotted flying above the clouds over Hartlepool \u201cextremely fast and soundless with flames over the front\u201d in November 2022.\n\nA 30ft to 40ft wide \u201cround saucer-like object with detailed outer rim\u201d was seen \u201chovering over a house\u201d in Bedworth, Warwickshire, in January.\n\nSome Somerset sightings include two round discs, a dull red colour, following the flight path of an aircraft with no sound unlike the aircraft over Shepton Mallet, a moving light disappeared at Orion. Followed by multiple other lights all in the same place moving West to East over Glastonbury, and a tic-tac like shape moving very slowly in the sky above Spaxton.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings (48%) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25%) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17%), \u201csphere\u201d, (10%) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (9%).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34). When it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts. Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold - former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team - told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d. However, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US submarines and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government - or any other government - are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d He insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by Chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies. While the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be."

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump carries a pair of his new signature shoes before taking the stage at Sneaker Con at the Philadelphia Convention Center on February 17, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nCampaign catchphrases aside, we can probably all agree that this was a very weird year in politics, particularly in Pennsylvania, the swingiest of swing states. Before we look ahead to 2025 let\u2019s review the ways Pennsylvania\u2019s politics and politicians got a little (or a lot) weird in 2024.\n\nAs unlikely as it may seem, President-elect Donald Trump did, in fact, take the stage at Sneaker Con in Philly back in February to unveil an official sneaker: gold high-tops with American flag logos, available for pre-order at $399 (limit three pairs per customer). Reporter John Cole had to convince his editor it wasn\u2019t a social media joke, and ended up with a front row seat despite little advance notice from the campaign about where and how to catch Trump\u2019s appearance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump admitted the sneakerhead crowd was \u201ca slightly different audience than I\u2019m used to,\u201d but also said launching the shoe line was something he had wanted to do for \u201ca long time.\u201d He did not wear the shoes on stage. And further proving that politics make strange bedfellows, we discovered that according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the president of Sneaker Con made donations to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and a Trump-affiliated PAC, although in relatively small amounts.\n\nDuring a budget hearing in February, the head of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) talked about the agency tracking UFO sightings, to the surprise of committee chairperson Jordan Harris. It took a while to receive them, but senior reporter Peter Hall sought records on the sightings, which showed PEMA investigated more than a dozen incidents over the past decade.\n\nThe sightings included mysterious lights following a motorist on a dark country road, a saucer-shaped craft hovering over a suburban subdivision, and a flaming orb falling into the woods, the records show. Many of the incidents are reported to Stan Gordon, a Westmoreland County resident who operates a 24-hour UFO, bigfoot and cryptid reporting hotline, who said the line has \u201cnever stopped ringing\u201d since the Kecksburg UFO incident of 1965.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always taken these cases very open mindedly,\u201d Gordon told the Capital-Star \u201cWe approach them scientifically.\u201d\n\nMold in a government office does not seem like the kind of situation that would require a whistleblower, but here we are. A staffer at Rep. Eric Davanzo\u2019s (R-Westmoreland) district office in West Newton complained of foul odors, and bought tests to check for the presence of mold. That didn\u2019t go over too well when the tests came back positive, and she was later fired. She sued for wrongful termination and the Commonwealth Court ruled she could move forward with a whistleblower lawsuit.\n\nFirst things first: If you want to try to modify the weather in Pennsylvania, you need a license \u2014 but since the law took effect in 1967 no one has applied for one (we asked).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin), former GOP nominee for governor, claims that new technology and a proliferation of weather modification patents \u201cowned by a combination of Federal Government Agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations, and large multinational corporations\u201d have brought forward the need to update Pennsylvania\u2019s law. He wrote a memo seeking co-sponsor for legislation he intends to introduce.\n\nThe legislation would ban the release of substances within the borders of Pennsylvania to affect the temperature, weather or intensity of sunlight, and appears to be rooted in the false belief that condensation trails left by high flying aircraft are actually trails of chemicals \u2014 aka chemtrails \u2014 released by the government for nefarious reasons, that has become conflated with techniques being explored to reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the atmosphere.\n\nIt\u2019s not often you get the opportunity to write a story with so much potential to use the phrase \u201cred wave.\u201d Alas, it only occurred to our headline writer much later (which, truly, is probably for the best). In June, Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton) objected to a bill to create a grant program that would make pads and tampons free for public school students. She didn\u2019t like that the bill\u2019s cosponsorship memo referred to menstruating women as \u201cpeople,\u201d and claimed the bill was \u201cjust another step by the governor and Democrats to have government provide everything for you, which leads to communism.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s prime sponsors, Rep. Darisha Parker (D-Philadelphia), said the bill would serve to \u201crestore the dignity to these women and girls who have gone unsupported far too long.\u201d\n\nThe bill passed the House by a vote of 117 to 85. It did not advance in the Senate."

            "article_content": "2024 was another fabulous year for video game releases, and indie games truly shined all year long. This is normally the time when we\u2019d list our top 10 indies, and we do just that below. However, we also don\u2019t believe this year could be confined to a measly 10 games, even in indies. That\u2019s why we included 14 more.\n\nShacknews Top 24 Indies, 24 - 11\n\n24. Little Kitty, Big City\n\n23. Felvidek\n\n22. Card-en-Ciel\n\n19. Kamikaze Lassplanes\n\n19. Fields of Mistria\n\n19. Luma Island\n\n18. Isles of Sea and Sky\n\n17. Slitterhead\n\n16. Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore\n\n15. Thank Goodness You're Here!\n\n14. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes\n\n13. 1000xRESIST\n\n12. Tales of Kenzara: ZAU\n\n11. Penny's Big Breakaway\n\nCongrats to those that made our list, even if they couldn\u2019t be in the Top 10. Voting was tight this year and many of these games are that splendid and were hotly contested! Each of them is well worth a check if you\u2019ve haven\u2019t played them yet, so we wish them all congrats for launching this year. Without further ado. It\u2019s time to move on to Shacknews Top 10 Indie Games of 2024. Here they are:\n\n10. Crow Country\n\nThere's a lot of nostalgia wrapped up in 90s horror games, and it's quite special how the team behind Crow Country managed to perfectly capture not only the look, but the vibe and feel of those games with this year's indie horror hit.\n\nCrow Country dials up scares without an excessive use of jump scares or other cheap tactics. Instead, SFB Games uses atmosphere to unsettle its players. From the music and sound design to bizarre creature models, Crow Country nestles itself deep under your skin.\n\nThe mystery of Crow Country was fodder for countless YouTubers this year as the community collaborated to piece together the clues laid out by SFB Games. It takes a special kind of game to foster that sort of community, and Crow Country is an excellent ambassador for the indie horror space.\n\nCrow Country is available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms.\n\n9. The Axis Unseen\n\nThere was little doubt that Nate Purkeypile was going to give us a game to remember from the moment he revealed The Axis Unseen because regardless of where you stand on indies, first-person games, or survival games, this one is an incredible concept: A heavy metal-inspired survival game where you wander the wilderness with a bow, arrows, and supernatural powers as you hunt cryptids and they often hunt you in turn.\n\nPurkeypile came out of the gate looking all sorts of ambitious with this one. He was an early adopter of Unreal Engine 5 in the indie game dev community, and it was clear from early on how much UE5's streamlined asset creation and specialized tools were a boon to the experienced environmental designer. The Axis Unseen's wilderness is rich and wicked, featuring a vast forest full of hills, mountains, and creatures to discover.\n\nThe Axis Unseen's creature design is also on point. It starts with small, mostly benign critters that will really only attack you if you attack them. However, it's not long before you running into tree giants that can impale you with thorny branches and intense Bigfoot creatures that can beat your brains in a jiffy if they catch you. The smart use of your arrows and the powers you can imbue into them is the only way you stand a chance.\n\nWhen it came to 2024's gaming year, The Axis Unseen was maybe one of the most interesting indie stoies. Nate Purkeypile clearly had a distinct vision and the experience to know how he wanted to apply it, but his early work in UE5 feels like a story other indie devs should appreciate and study. Even then, how many other games let you try to outmaneuver and hunt Bigfoot amid outcroppings of giant radical horned skulls and creature skeletons?\n\nThe Axis Unseen is available on Steam and Epic Games Store platforms.\n\n8. Mouthwashing\n\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of games that unnerve us here at Shacknews. Mouthwashing more than unnerved us, it wormed its way into our brain, made is feel uncomfortable, unpleasant, and disgusted at what people are capable of doing. It\u2019s also hands-down one of the indie games this year.\n\nMouthwashing is a psychological horror game set aboard a cargo vessel that\u2019s transporting goods between planets. The crew is small, consisting of just five people, and as you might assume, tensions fray. The game kicks off with the ship colliding with a celestial body after someone sabotaged the flight controls.\n\nFrom this point onward, the narrative plays out along two timelines: the lead up to the crash and following the crash. You\u2019ll be walking around the ship, helping solve the issues that crop up, from general maintenance to smoothing over everyone\u2019s emotional state. But things go sideways quickly.\n\nMouthwashing instils a sense of impending dread as the crew fights to survive not just dwindling supplies, but their withering emotional and mental stability. It\u2019s a harrowing game that left us staring at our screens, mouth agape, as the credits rolled. Want to feel gut-punched? Play Mouthwashing.\n\nMouthwashing is available on the Steam platform.\n\n7. Another Crab's Treasure\n\nSince Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring have solidified what the souls-like genre is, there have been no lack of studios derivating on it. But few have made their version of this genre stand out from the regular Soulsborne vibe like Another Crab\u2019s Treasure. Instead of being a forsaken ethereal being wandering through a fallen kingdom or the remains of a ferocious war, you\u2019re a hermit crab named Kril who just wants his shell back after a literal loan shark takes it from him. With that, you wander the floor of an ocean where all the local life has taken a shine to human garbage that has littered the seabed. And so, it\u2019s an undersea souls-like in which your \u201csoul\u201d resources are trash and your various weapons are \u201cshells\u201d Kril can equip that give him unique powers.\n\nThe environment itself in Another Crab\u2019s Treasure is equal parts funny, pretty, and upsetting. Every area you go to has some level of natural undersea beauty to it, but it\u2019s tainted with the cheap veneer of repurposed garbage from the human world that sea creatures have become enamored with. What most of them don\u2019t know is that prolonged contact with that trash makes them crazy and violent.\n\nThat means Kril has to fight through insane creatures, many of which are much larger than him. What\u2019s a hermit crab to do? Well, that\u2019s where the shells come in. At any time, Kril can jump into a nearby soda can, banana peel, yogurt cup, or any other prop to defend himself as he fights back with his trusty crab fork and fishing hook. The shell also matters because each of them has a different power you can use to even the odds and stay alive. For instance, the soda can lets you dodge backwards and release a spray of bubbles that home in on a target. Using the right shell in the right situation is key if you\u2019re going to survive. It\u2019s challenging to play, but Aggro Crab was also brave enough to allow you to soften the difficulty, up to and including the ridiculous option to give Kril a gun.\n\nUltimately, Aggro Crab blends a solid display of comedy and charm with a stark undertone. Its funny crab and crazy fish are cute as heck, but they can also be scary and upsetting in near equal capacity. The environments have a similar energy. Put that together with responsive action and platforming under the sea and you just might see the value of Another Crab\u2019s Treasure.\n\nAnother Crab's Treasure is available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms.\n\n6. The Plucky Squire\n\nThe Plucky Squire immediately climbed our most anticipated games of the year list when got our first glimpse at its reality-bending art style. With the combination of 2D and 3D art styles, developer All Possible Futures is able to have their cake and eat it, too.\n\nNot only is The Plucky Squire satisfying to look at, it's fun to play, too. It's levels and puzzles are packed with homages to the classics of the genre, with enough originality to keep gameplay feeling fresh.\n\nPlaying through The Plucky Squire is like reading a storybook rich with humor and fun characters. We hope this isn't the last we see of this neat little universe.\n\nThe Plucky Squire is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\n5. UFO 50\n\nWhen we learned the developers of Spelunky and its sequel were going to be developing a new game, we expected it would be something cool. What we could have never guessed was that it would be 50 somethings that were each, in fact, cool. UFO 50 is a collection like nothing else. It\u2019s an homage to a vast array of classic video game titles and might be the most ridiculously efficient bang for your gaming buck, especially since many of its included games turned out to be full-length titles.\n\nRight from the get-go Mossmouth allows players access to every single one of the 50 games in UFO 50. The idea is that a mysterious company released all these games in obscurity. They all hearken back to the days of 80s arcades and home platforms, with some being very short and easy to beat while others are like full-length RPGs of the time that could take hours to complete.\n\nThey\u2019re a pretty awesome spread of titles too. Action, horror, sports, adventure, puzzle, and even narrative journeys are among those included here. Heck, there are even homages to metroidvanias, first-person dungeon crawlers, and narrative horror like NES\u2019s Uninvited, Deja Vu, and Shadowgate. Yet somehow, Mossmouth was able to also pack in its signature charm and humor in most cases, making this an altogether incredible collection.\n\nUFO 50 is a very easy game to recommend to anyone at any age because of the way it\u2019s set up. There\u2019s something for just about everyone here, and pretty much all of these games are worth trying at least once. We don\u2019t know what compelled Mossmouth to pack 50 different games into a single title, but we can\u2019t help but applaud the absolute madness and the quality that each title contains.\n\nUFO 50 is available on the Steam platform.\n\n4. Neva\n\nNeva delivered one of the year's most beautiful narratives with the tale of woman's bond with a wolf. It explores the relationship between a person and their animal companion, poignantly examining the highs and lows that entail.\n\nVisually, Neva is one of the year's most stunning games. Every location is picturesque, beautiful vistas juxtaposed against a decaying world.\n\nNeva is also a competent platformer, providing a decent challenge throughout its 5-6 hours of gameplay. That said, those in it for the narrative can opt to play in Story Mode.\n\nNeva is a reminder of the impact that video games can have, and that some of the best stories in games reside in the indie space.\n\nNeva is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\n3. Pacific Drive\n\nPacific Drive saw an early release in 2024, but Ironwood Studios\u2019 sci-fi driving survival game got its hooks in and stayed with us well throughout the year. In all of 2024 gaming (and really beyond it for that matter), there was nothing quite like what Pacific Drive brought to the table. Moreover, its environments, music, and narrative were great enough to make sure that when this year\u2019s Shacknews Awards deliberations came around, it was still solidified in our minds as one of this year\u2019s most unique titles.\n\nIn Pacific Drive, you are a mysterious investigator that ventures into the mountainous forest region of the Pacific Northwest to a place known as the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Serious environmental experiments and oddities occurred in this place which led to the government building a barrier around it to keep what was inside, inside, and what was outside, outside. Obviously your intrusion means it didn\u2019t quite work, but it also isn\u2019t long before you discover a seemingly innocuous station wagon that acts as your getaway from a rough situation. And shortly after that, you discover folks that were both studying the Zone and got trapped by it. You also find a garage, which plays a big role in the rest of your journey.\n\nTo escape the Zone (theoretically) you\u2019ll need to venture deeper into it and collect energy from anomalous sites to power various experimental machinery. The Zone is a pretty fragile place, so every journey into a new area finds you traversing randomized stretches of dense forests and hills in the Station Wagon as you loot the supplies you need, build the tools that make things easier, and generally try to keep your station wagon maintained. After all, there\u2019s also freakish anomalies that can be a danger to you and the car such as autonomous piles of electrified scrap. Also, when you take the energy you need from a place in the Zone, that area\u2019s stability will collapse and it\u2019s a race to get out alive.\n\nGetting back to the garage and being able to recuperate with your pillaged resources was brief recompense, and it also feels therapeutic to repair and upgrade your car for the next adventure. You can even paint and put decals on it to make it truly your own. All of these things together made Pacific Drive a game unlike really anything else this year, and Ironwood Studios deserves to be celebrated for such an interesting journey, not to mention assembling such a perfect sci-fi roadtrip soundtrack with all of the good vibes of a personal mixtape.\n\nPacific Drive is available on PlayStation, and Steam platforms.\n\n2. Animal Well\n\nEveryone knew Animal Well was special the moment they laid eyes on it. The cute and unassuming pixel art style of a dark and lonely world was just dripping with mysteries to solve. Then it released and everyone realized the genius at work in Billy Basso\u2019s head.\n\nAnimal Well is a Metroidvania unlike anything that has come before it. There\u2019s no combat to be found, and as a tiny little critter, your only course of action against any threat is to run \u2013 or use the cleverly designed tools to your advantage.\n\nYou see, you\u2019re not going to get something as straightforward as unlocking double-jump or a grapple hook. You\u2019re going to get a Frisbee, a yo-yo, and other childhood toys. It\u2019s not even going to be clear how these things work and how you might use them to solve the game\u2019s myriad puzzles and navigate its dense, secret-packed world.\n\nBut when you do figure out how to use these items, you\u2019ll see the world differently. These little light bulb moments happen constantly throughout Animal Well as you engage in one of the best puzzle-platforming games this year.\n\nThough it hasn\u2019t secured our Indie Game of the Year 2024 award, it has come remarkably close and remains a favorite among the staff here at Shacknews. If you\u2019re a fan of unassuming indie games that have a tendency to blow your mind, you need to do yourself a favor and check out Animal Well.\n\nAnimal Well is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\n1. Balatro\n\nThinking back over the past few decades at Shacknews, the staff is hard-pressed to think of any indie game that has garnered such universal acclaim or been as accomplished as Balatro. There have been memorable indie titles over the years. Games like Journey, Gone Home, and Hades come to mind as true standout efforts. Yet Balatro feels like it stands above them all. It certainly stands out over an incredibly stacked field of outstanding indie titles in 2024.\n\nFor solo developer LocalThunk to build on a relatively simple idea and captivate the entire gaming world has been nothing short of impressive. A poker roguelike sounds like a simple idea in theory, but the execution and the way it all came together has been special. Thousands of players across multiple platforms continue to try and chase high scores, just like in gaming days of old, all while utilizing well thought-out strategies and rolling with whatever luck befalls them. There are few sensations better in gaming right now than when a Balatro run comes together with the right combinations of rare Jokers, enhanced cards, and Boss Blinds that somehow manage not to upend the entire outing.\n\nThe Balatro formula is so easy to get into and drives its hooks in deep. It's part of why the Shacknews staff feared the day that it came to mobile devices, because it's the kind of game that's perfect to play on-the-go. It ranks up with historic handheld greats like Tetris and Dr. Mario in terms of easy accessibility and \"one more game\" loops that never seem to end.\n\nLocalThunk's efforts have been remarkable. It's amazing to see a single artist put the bulk of the work into such an expertly crafted game. It's the kind of phenomenon that gaming may never see for a long time. Shacknews was privileged to see the tale of Balatro play out over the course of 2024 and we're happy to name it the Shacknews Best Indie Game of 2024.\n\nBalatro is available on Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\nCheck out our Shacknews Indie Game of the Year 2024 - Balatro article to read more.\n\nWe salute everyone who released a game in this very difficult year for so many game developers. We couldn\u2019t do our jobs without these amazing creators. Thank you for another year of amazing indie games and congratulations to everyone who made our Shacknews Top 24 Indie Games of the Year 2024 list.\n\nBe sure to read over the rest of the Shacknews Awards in our Year of the Games: 2024 feature."

            "article_content": "AI is now everywhere, even if it is not natively integrated. It has given everyone the power to get things done, understand complex things, and create images using their imagination. Meta AI, the AI-powered chatbot, has been rolled out to almost everyone, and here is how to use the Meta AI in WhatsApp, Instagram, or Facebook.\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of all these apps before you try. Also, it is possible that Meta may not have rolled it out for all users and countries. So, if you press @ and Meta AI doesn\u2019t show up, that would be why.\n\nHow to use Meta AI in WhatsApp\n\nMeta AI was the first to roll on WhatsApp and has been incredibly useful for many. If you are a small business or struggle with creative writing, Meta AI can help you rather quickly. You can access Meta AI using the @ button in single or group chat and interact with it directly as a contact.\n\nSince the group chats are visible to everyone, use the one-to-one chat to get things done and then forward it to other groups or chats.\n\nYou can also access Meta AI using the individual chat option. The interesting part is that Meta AI now offers an AI studio with many ChatBots of different styles. That includes advice and connections, pop culture, Anime, and more.\n\nRead: Stop Meta from using your data for AI training\n\nHow to use Meta AI in Instagram\n\nInstagram is all about Reels and Images. That\u2019s where the Meta AI imagine feature comes into the picture. While it is not natively integrated yet, you can use it in Group or Individual conversations by asking it to generate images using the /imagine switch.\n\nHow to use Meta AI in Facebook Messenger\n\nLike above, you can quickly access Meta AI using the @ button from the text box. You can then ask a question; for example, you can ask for restaurant recommendations, information on a topic, or even a request. Or you can go ahead and tag a conversation and ask Meta to explain it.\n\nIf images are your thing, then directly type /imagine or @metaAI /imagine followed by your description, and it will generate AI images you can send. However, do remember that Meta AI will provide answers or content directly within your chat, visible to all participants.\n\nRead: Is it Real or AI Picture? How to identify using tools?\n\nMeta AI in WhatsApp is not working\n\nIf Meta AI isn\u2019t working correctly in WhatsApp, make sure your app is up to date, as older versions might not support the feature. If issues persist, clear the app\u2019s cache through your phone\u2019s settings to resolve minor glitches. Restart the app by closing and reopening it to refresh the connection.\n\nMeta AI is not able to read chat in the Group\n\nEven though Meta Ai is part of WhatsApp groups or Messenger, it can read or analyze a message even if tagged. If you want it to read, you must type it, and it will be visible to everyone."

            "category": "ai+app",
            "date": "18h",
            "source": "The Motley Fool",
            "article_content": "Ark Investment Management operates several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on innovative technology stocks. Its founder, Cathie Wood, believes software companies are the next big opportunity in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, predicting they could generate up to $8 in revenue for every $1 they spend on chips from suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nWood has invested in AI start-ups like xAI, OpenAI, and Anthropic through the Ark Venture Fund since making that prediction last year, so she's backing up her words with decisive action. Moreover, Ark's various ETFs own several leading AI software stocks like Amazon and Tesla.\n\nIf Wood proves to be right about AI software companies, here's why C3.ai (AI -4.26%) and Microsoft (MSFT -1.73%) might be two of the biggest winners in the coming years.\n\n1. The case for C3.ai\n\nC3.ai was the world's first enterprise AI company when it was founded in 2009. Now, it offers over 100 ready-made AI applications for businesses, which can help them accelerate their adoption of this revolutionary technology. C3.ai's software is especially popular in industries that aren't normally known for developing cutting-edge technology, like energy, manufacturing, and financial services.\n\nDow, which is one of the world's largest manufacturers of chemicals, uses the C3.ai Reliability application to monitor equipment and conduct predictive maintenance. It has reduced downtime by 20% so far, which translates to fewer costs and more revenue. Similarly, one multinational bank deployed the C3.ai Anti-Money Laundering application to detect fraud, and it resulted in a 200% increase in the number of correctly identified suspicious transactions.\n\nC3.ai sells its applications directly to customers, but it also has joint sales agreements with the three major cloud giants, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. C3.ai integrates with those platforms and leverages their computing power to give customers the performance they need. Since most businesses already use one of those three cloud providers, it's extremely easy for them to adopt C3.ai's applications.\n\nDuring C3.ai's fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended Oct. 31), 62% of its deals were closed through its partnership network, so it's a critical sales channel for the company.\n\nC3.ai generated a record $94.3 million in revenue during the quarter. That was a 29% increase from the year-ago period, and it marked the seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The company is reaping the benefits of a change to its business model from two years ago, when it switched from subscription-based revenue to consumption-based revenue. It streamlined the onboarding process by eliminating lengthy negotiating processes, so customers can sign up faster than ever.\n\nDeveloping AI is expensive, and it requires specialized expertise that many companies don't have. Therefore, as AI adoption spreads, more enterprises will turn to providers of ready-made solutions like C3.ai. That's why this could be a great AI stock for investors to own for the long term.\n\n2. The case for Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has a rich history of innovation that led to the creation of a broad portfolio of software products like the Windows operating system, Azure cloud platform, and 365 productivity applications (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint). The company is also a leader in AI software, thanks to its near-$14 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nThe partnership -- which dates back to 2019 -- paved the way for Microsoft to launch the Copilot AI assistant, which is now embedded into most of its flagship software apps. Copilot for 365, for example, can help users rapidly create text and image content in Word and PowerPoint, which can significantly boost their productivity. It can also answer complex questions, which is very useful when conducting research.\n\nOrganizations around the world pay for more than 400 million 365 licenses for their employees, and each of them is a candidate to add Copilot for an additional monthly subscription fee. Microsoft says 70% of the Fortune 500 companies are using Copilot for 365 already, and the number of people who use it daily more than doubled in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30).\n\nMicrosoft also created Azure AI for its cloud customers. It allows businesses to access state-of-the-art computing infrastructure to develop AI software, and it also provides them with access to industry-leading large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI's latest o1 series. Microsoft says demand is outstripping supply for its AI data center infrastructure, but the company spent around $20 billion to build more capacity during Q1. That spending is likely to ramp up in the coming quarters.\n\nValuation might be one drawback to buying Microsoft stock right now. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.2, which is a 10% premium to its 10-year average of 32.8. However, as represented by the orange line in the below chart, its forward P/E ratio (based on the consensus earnings estimate from Wall Street for the next year) is 29.2:\n\nIn other words, even though Microsoft stock is technically expensive today, it might actually be cheap for investors who are willing to hold it for at least the next year.\n\nIf Cathie Wood is right and AI software generates $8 in revenue for every $1 companies spend on chips, the potential payoff from Microsoft's data center infrastructure investments could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars in the future. As a result, it's hard to look past Microsoft stock as one of the top AI software plays."

But head honcho Sam Lake says it's too early to even think about how it's all going to end.\n\nRemedy games always had easter eggs and mysterious references to other stories in the studio's gameography, but the connection was made 'canon' in Control's AWE DLC, which either stands for Alan Wake Expansion or Altered World Event depending on who you ask. Last year's excellent Alan Wake 2 then fleshed out that interlocked story further, and even unofficially (for probably legal reasons) tied it to back Max Payne and Quantum Break - both of which are owned by Rockstar Games and Xbox respectively.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when asked about if there's an endgame in sight - an Avengers Endgame type of conclusion, if you will - Sam Lake told IGN that the studio are \"just getting started\" and \"it's too early to start talking about an endgame.\"\n\n\"I love tying these things together,\" he said. \"I love making it deeper and expanding on the lore. It really feels like this kind of opportunity to take these strands that we have put there, expand, entertain different ideas. It feels really exciting. And the way we are looking at it is, every game needs to be enjoyable on its own and stand on its own feet, but then, for our fans, for people who have been playing other Remedy games, we want to put in a lot of content for them to discover for the ongoing universe story.\"\n\nLake also explains that newcomers can jump into any of their games, and then hopefully dip back into the other, older Remedy games to \"dive deeper into that rabbit hole.\"\n\nFor now, Remedy will continue tugging at these threads in its first ever co-op shooter FBC: Firebreak coming next year, paranormal sequel Control 2, and maybe even with its Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes in collaboration with Rockstar Games.\n\nCheck out more upcoming games of 2025 and beyond to not miss a single beat."

            "article_content": "A witch who lives in a cemetery with human corpses has revealed how she leads a paranormal, supernatural lifestyle.\n\nWren Harris is a qualified Clinical Aromatherapist, Massage Therapist and Reiki Practitioner, and she\u2019s been a witch for 26 years. The 41-year-old, who\u2019s from Leicestershire, explains how she\u2019s always felt more at home in \u2018supernatural settings\u2019, which is why she lives in a three-bedroom house in a cemetery.\n\nWren shares her home with husband Justin, 50, and their children, and explains that she never turns away any visitor who is in need of help to locate the grave of a loved one buried near her home. To share her experiences with the supernatural, Wren runs an Instagram account under the name of \u2018@the_cemetety_witch\u2019 and has over 36,000 followers.\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\n\"When we first moved in I felt the presence of a man in our bedroom near the fireplace and moving towards the window, almost like a piece of video playing out,\" Wren said. \"He was not aware of me and seemed to be going about his business. I have also felt a presence near my bed on several occasions, like someone was standing there.\n\n\"We also had some activity in the lounge when we first moved in, some loud noises and bangs that had no source. All the activity seemed to stop once we settled. Recently our youngest daughter has experienced something. She couldn't put it into words but refused to sleep in the bedroom for about six months. Otherwise, our house has a sense of deep peace and things have largely settled now that we have been here a while.\n\n\"I was drawn to the space next to our house and initially thought it might be a small area for us to use, but it turns out that it's where babies are buried. Often they were buried without headstones in Victorian England because they were expensive and deaths amongst children were extremely common. I've had several miscarriages myself and feel protective over this part of the cemetery and wonder if that's why I was drawn to it.\"\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\nAlthough this would be alarming to most, Wren refuses to allow trolls who spread \"fear and hatred\" to affect her and is instead focused on making witchcraft accessible and challenging dangerous and outdated beliefs. \"There are always those people who go out of their way to locate Witchcraft accounts and leave negative comments. Usually these people have closed, private accounts and don't leave themselves open in the way that I do,\u201d said Wren.\n\n\"Sadly, most of these people are ardent Christians who have a warped view of Witchcraft. Under a picture of a late friend who was prominent in the Druid community, someone on Instagram left the comment that he was, 'now burning in hell.' The irony was not lost on me that this person who was claiming that their way is the only way and that they are morally superior, was the person spreading fear and hatred. They left a number of aggressive comments across my account denouncing me as all kinds of evil. But I don't let these comments get to me.\"\n\nWren's journey with witchcraft began when she found a book on the occult when she was only twelve years old. She says that she immediately felt a sense of familiarity like she had returned \"home\". It has also allowed her to \"love and accept\" herself and \"strive to do better\" and her parents were supportive of her newfound practice.\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) Image: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\nShe explained: \"When I was about 12, I found a book in my parents' loft called Cult and Occult by Francis King. It had been put aside to sell at a car boot sale. It covered topics such as sacred geometry, palmistry and dowsing. There was a section on British Witchcraft and I was mesmerised by the photographs; there was something about them that seemed incredibly familiar as if I'd gone 'home'. Not long after this experience, I went on a trip to Avebury Stone Circle and West Kennet Long Barrow with my school, leaving me enchanted further.\n\n\"Between these two experiences a whole new world had opened up to me. At about age 14 or 15 my mum paid for a subscription to a magazine called \"Mind, Body & Spirit\u201d. It was a ring binder collection where you received a new candle or crystal or tarot card each week, and that opened my eyes further.\n\n\"As soon as I turned 18 I joined the Pagan Federation and the Children of Artemis - two organisations which helped me step onto my path properly and led me to start meeting other like-minded folk. In recent years I have written for Witchcraft magazines and websites, reviewing books in Witchcraft, and been involved in the Pagan community both online and in person.\"\n\nWren tries to incorporate Witchcraft into her daily routine. She explains: \"Our house is extremely cold so I currently start the day with a cup of something hot, stirring in good vibes and setting my intentions for the day. I usually light some incense and a candle and set about the tasks of the day. Often we'll get a knock on the door for cemetery business, delivery men trying to find our address or people trying to locate graves. When my husband comes home we have a cup of tea together and make dinner, which again involves a bit of magic in its preparation. Many of my daily rituals and tasks involve some form of Witchcraft. Each waking moment is a chance for intention setting and opportunity. Each waking moment is a chance for joy and celebration.\"\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\nShe says that it gives her life more meaning and allows her to be completely authentic. \"Witchcraft is a lifestyle for me,\" Wren said. \"It is my beliefs, my attitudes, my practices. It is an opportunity for me to stand in my authentic self. It is an opportunity to embrace the turn of the Wheel and celebrate the deep meaning of the seasons as we navigate our way through the year, deepening our connection to nature.\n\n\"These celebrations add context and meaning to life and the passing of time. This path has helped me love and accept myself as an individual, made me strive to do better, and truly embrace the important things in life.\"\n\nWren is also extremely passionate about helping other Witches on their spiritual journeys and challenging negative perceptions of Witchcraft.\"I'm passionate about Witchcraft and would love to team this with the enthusiasm of others starting out on their path,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd really like to help and inspire new witches by sharing what I've learned by releasing my own personal Grimoire and mentoring in some way. I feel I have stepped into the Crone aspect of my life and Witchcraft journey, and it is now time to widen the circle by sharing my experience and knowledge.\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\n\"I am passionate about educating others on the topic of Witchcraft, making it accessible and dispelling myths. And I feel sorry for people who are driven to spend their time judging others. I truly wish the best for them and hope they can find a kinder way in their treatment of others moving forward. I think that we are very lucky in the UK in that we are more likely to be laughed at for calling ourselves witches, rather than being persecuted, which is absolutely brilliant, but I do think there is some element of not being taken seriously.\"\n\nWren also offered some advice for those who are interested in Witchcraft or leading a more spiritual life. \"What drives many Pagans is a deep love for nature and the desire for self-development,\" she said. \"We're also a very friendly bunch that love a good celebration. Buy some books on the subject, maybe approach some experienced witches for advice, and get reading and practising. Embrace who you are and don't compare you or your journey to others. The truth is that the learning on this path never stops - that's the beauty of it.\n\n\"The word \"witch\" is just a label that doesn't need to be adopted if it doesn't feel right. Some people lead magical lives without even realising it. That there are magical acts embedded in our everyday lives such as blowing out candles on a birthday cake and making a wish, drawing images in the air with a sparkler, or lighting a candle in church with loving intention.\n\n\"We all celebrate similar things, for example, the celebration of light in winter, which is celebrated by festivals spanning various religions. That those who follow this path are just like you and me.\""

            "article_content": "An artist's impression of a hot exoplanet.\n\nAstronomers have unveiled the discovery of two Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting a star more than 40 light-years from our planet, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing quest to identify potentially habitable worlds beyond our solar system. A team of researchers have outlined their findings in a paper published on the pre-print server arXiv and shared by phys.org. The star, HD 101581, also catalogued as GJ 435, is a K5V-type orange dwarf star located about 42 light years away. The two confirmed exoplanets, designated HD 101581 b and HD 101581 c, were identified through meticulous observations using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during its 63rd and 64th observation sectors. These planets exhibit radii comparable to Earth's, with HD 101581 b measuring approximately 0.956 times Earth's radius and HD 101581 c about 0.990 times. Their orbital periods are notably brief, with HD 101581 b completing a revolution around its host star every 4.47 days and HD 101581 c every 6.21 days.\n\nArtist's impression of the James Webb Telescope.\n\nAdditionally, a third candidate planet, HD 101581 d, has been detected, though its existence awaits further confirmation. If validated, this planet would also be Earth-sized, with an orbital period of approximately 7.9 days. The discovery of these Earth-sized exoplanets is especially compelling due to their relative proximity to our solar system, which facilitates more detailed study. Nevertheless, their close orbits to HD 101581 suggest that they are subjected to intense stellar radiation, resulting in higher surface temperatures than Earth's. This likely renders them inhospitable to life as we know it. Despite the remote possibility that they could harbour life, the planets offer invaluable opportunities for scientific investigation.\n\nRecent images from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Such research contributes to the broader objective of identifying Earth-like planets within habitable zones, where conditions may be conducive to life. This discovery arrives at a pivotal moment. The astronomical community anticipates a surge in exoplanet research in 2025, propelled by data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

            "article_content": "This holiday season, OpenAI's employees and former staff could experience an extraordinary financial windfall. A private stock sale orchestrated by the San Francisco-based leading AI company will allow approximately 400 eligible participants to cash in up to $10 million each, marking one of the most lucrative employee payouts in the tech industry.\n\nA Special Stock Sale\n\nThe opportunity comes via a tender offer from Japan's SoftBank Group, which has agreed to purchase up to $1.6 billion of OpenAI stock at $210 per share. This price reflects OpenAI's valuation of $157 billion, which has doubled in just a year, according to Fortune. Eligible shareholders include current and former OpenAI employees who were issued restricted stock units more than two years ago.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWho Benefits?\n\nCurrent OpenAI employees will receive priority in this stock sale. Fortune reports they can cash out the maximum allowable amount of $10 million each. Former employees, while also eligible, may face limits depending on the level of participation. However, all participants are guaranteed to sell at least $2 million worth of stock, ensuring that everyone benefits from the opportunity.\n\nThe participation deadline was set for Dec. 24, so the resulting payout offers a timely holiday bonus for those involved. The eligible stock is reportedly valued at $2 billion, but some shares may remain unsold, with SoftBank purchasing $1.6 billion.\n\nA Growing Valuation\n\nOpenAI's stock sale aligns with its dramatic growth. According to CNBC, since the launch of ChatGPT, the company has raised $13 billion, including $6.6 billion in its most recent fundraising round in October. SoftBank initially invested $500 million during this round and its latest tender offer represents an even greater stake in the AI leader. Other notable investors include Microsoft and chipmaker Nvidia.\n\nSee Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nTender offers like this have become increasingly important in the tech industry, especially given a subdued IPO market. By allowing employees to sell shares, companies like OpenAI provide liquidity to their teams while avoiding the pressures of going public.\n\nPolicy Revisions\n\nThis tender offer also reflects OpenAI's evolving policies toward secondary share sales. Past restrictions limited participation and raised employee concerns, but the company has since introduced changes to create a more inclusive process. Now, current and former employees have equal access to annual tender offers, ensuring a fairer system.\n\nAccording to CNBC, the policy shift has quelled shareholder tensions while positioning OpenAI to maintain its capital-intensive operations. With plans to facilitate more secondary sales in the future, the company is addressing the growing demand for liquidity among tech workers.\n\nTrending: It\u2019s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art \u2014 this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here\u2019s how everyday investors are getting started.\n\nCompetition and Market Dynamics\n\nOpenAI faces stiff competition from rivals such as Anthropic and tech giants like Google. Yet, the company's valuation and continued fundraising highlight its dominance in the rapidly expanding generative AI market. Bloomberg states it will generate $1 trillion in revenue within the next decade.\n\nSoftBank's commitment to AI investments extends beyond OpenAI. The conglomerate has backed other startups, including Glean and Perplexity and recently announced plans with President-elect Donald Trump to allocate $100 billion toward projects in the U.S., according to The Associated Press.\n\nHoliday Cheer for OpenAI Employees\n\nThis tender offer represents a rare opportunity for OpenAI's employees to turn their equity into tangible wealth. Whether they cash out partially or take full advantage of the $10 million cap, the payout is a testament to the company's success and commitment to rewarding its team.\n\nOpenAI's stock sale reminds us of the financial opportunities available in the tech industry, especially for those working at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.\n\nRead Next:"

Illustration: Tech & Startup Desk\n\nOpenAI, the company behind the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, announced on Friday that it plans to restructure as a public benefit corporation (PBC) - shifting to a for-profit company from its previous non-profit structure.\n\nAccording to the company, this change is aimed at helping the company raise more money to fund its efforts in developing advanced AI systems, including artificial general intelligence (AGI)\u2014AI that could potentially surpass human intelligence.\n\nHow will this new structure work?\n\nThe new structure will turn OpenAI's for-profit branch into a PBC based in Delaware. This type of company is required to balance making money with benefiting society. OpenAI says this move will make it easier to attract investors who need a simpler setup to invest large amounts of money, as per a recent report by Reuters on the matter.\n\nCompetition in the AI field is growing quickly, with companies spending billions of dollars to advance technology, suggests the Reuters report. OpenAI's last funding round in October raised $6.6 billion, valuing the company at $157 billion. However, the funding came with conditions\u2014OpenAI had to promise to remove profit limits for investors within two years.\n\nWhy this change?\n\nIn a blog post, OpenAI explained the need for the change, saying: \"The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission.\"\n\nEven with the restructuring, OpenAI's nonprofit branch will still play an important role. It will own a large share of the new PBC, based on evaluations by financial experts, making it one of the best-funded nonprofits ever, says the company.\n\nConcerns regarding this change\n\nOpenAI's decision for a for-profit shift has sparked criticism and legal challenges. Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI who left the company, has filed a lawsuit, claiming the move prioritises profits over public benefit and breaks earlier agreements. OpenAI has asked a federal court to dismiss the lawsuit, saying Musk originally supported the idea of for-profit changes.\n\nMeta Platforms has also raised concerns, reportedly asking California's attorney general to block the restructuring. Critics argue that while PBCs are meant to balance public good and profits, there's no strong enforcement to ensure companies stick to their missions, adds the Reuters report.\n\nOpenAI's decision reflects the growing pressure to keep up in the fast-moving and costly world of AI development. Whether the new structure can truly balance profits and public good remains to be seen."

Elizabeth Benassi, who began working at Maximus UK Services in 2022 at the age of 18, claimed she was unfairly targeted for her choice of footwear, despite other colleagues wearing similar shoes without repercussions.\n\nBenassi\u2019s case was heard at an employment tribunal in Croydon, south London, which ruled in her favour. The tribunal found that the company displayed a \u201cdesire to find fault\u201d with the young employee and had failed to inform her about its dress code policy.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nBenassi, employed for just three months, argued that she was singled out and treated \u201clike a child\u201d by her manager, who criticised her trainers. She told the tribunal that most of her colleagues were in their twenties, but as the youngest employee, she was subjected to excessive scrutiny and \u201cmicromanagement\u201d because of her age.\n\nEmployment Judge Forwell noted that Benassi was unfairly confronted about her footwear upon arriving at the office. \u201cNo allowance was made for the fact that she was new and may not have been familiar with the dress code,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIt was therefore a clear unfairness and indicates a desire to find fault.\u201d\n\nThe tribunal also rejected the agency\u2019s claim that Benassi had been made aware of the dress code policy. Judge Forwell pointed out that had such information been provided, it would likely have been mentioned in an email exchange at the time.\n\nMaximus UK Services, a company that provides recruitment services for the Department for Work and Pensions, denied any wrongdoing. However, the tribunal found the company guilty of victimisation and awarded Benassi \u00a329,187 in compensation.\n\nWhile the tribunal sided with Benassi on the issue of victimisation, her additional claim of age-related harassment was dismissed.\n\nThe case has sparked discussions about the treatment of young workers in the workplace and the potential for age-based discrimination. The tribunal\u2019s ruling underscores the importance of clear communication around workplace policies, as well as the need for fair treatment of new employees."

            "article_content": "Part 1: From the Roots of the Web to Columbia SC Website Design Excellence\n\nWeb design isn\u2019t just about making a website look pretty\u2014though that\u2019s often the initial impression people get when visiting a business online. It\u2019s about weaving a story, engaging visitors, and guiding them through an experience they\u2019ll remember. At Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve spent nearly two decades perfecting this craft, transforming how businesses in Columbia, South Carolina, and beyond connect with their audiences. Let me tell you, when you\u2019ve worked through every trend, from neon-tinted text on black backgrounds in the early 2000s to today\u2019s minimalist, responsive designs, you start to see the web as more than just code and graphics; it becomes an ecosystem of endless possibilities.\n\nThe Evolution of Design: From HTML Tables to Responsive Frameworks\n\nLet\u2019s rewind a little to the early 2000s. Websites back then were like those department store mannequins from the \u201890s\u2014awkwardly posed, overly dressed, and not very functional. Everything was laid out using HTML tables, CSS was still in its infancy, and JavaScript? Well, it was more likely to crash your browser than enhance your experience. In Columbia, SC, website design was no exception. Local businesses were just dipping their toes into the digital pond, and a \u201ccontact us\u201d form was considered cutting-edge.\n\nFast forward to today, and everything has changed. Frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS have turned the design process into something akin to Lego-building. You pick your components, snap them together, and voil\u00e0! But here\u2019s where it gets tricky: while these frameworks make development faster, they also come with their downsides. Bootstrap sites, for instance, can sometimes look overly similar, which is something Web Design Columbia actively avoids. Cookie-cutter designs? Not on our watch.\n\nThe Intersection of Creativity and Technology\n\nA fascinating statistic from a 2023 global survey showed that 38% of website visitors will stop engaging with a site if the layout is unattractive or the content is poorly structured. That\u2019s why Columbia SC website design firms like ours emphasize aesthetics and functionality. Every pixel and line of code has a purpose.\n\nOne of our more unique projects was redesigning a legacy site that had been built on Joomla\u2014an oldie but a goodie in the content management world. The site was functional but far from user-friendly, and the client wanted something that could compete with modern platforms like Shopify or WordPress. After hours of brainstorming, we restructured their database, migrated their content, and built a sleek, responsive design that worked seamlessly on every device. Here\u2019s a fun fact: that site saw a 120% increase in user engagement within six months.\n\nResponsive Design: A Double-edged Sword\n\nResponsive design\u2014where your website automatically adjusts to fit any screen size\u2014is one of the most significant innovations in web design. But, like all technologies, it\u2019s not without its challenges. Take Columbia SC website design as an example: while mobile responsiveness is now a given, optimizing for speed on mobile devices remains a headache for developers worldwide. According to a Google report, 53% of mobile users will leave a site if it takes longer than three seconds to load.\n\nAt Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve tackled this issue by combining the best server configurations with cutting-edge tools like Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights. We even use Cloudflare to reduce load times and improve security. But even with these tools, challenges persist. Older devices, for instance, often struggle with sites that rely heavily on JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. The balance between functionality and speed remains a dance we\u2019re perfecting.\n\nPlatforms of Choice: The Good, The Bad, and the Pricey\n\nWhen discussing Columbia, SC, website design, platforms like WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace must be mentioned. WordPress, which powers over 43% of the web, offers unparalleled flexibility, but its open-source nature can also be a curse. Owning a classic car is like owning a classic car: You can customize it endlessly, but without proper maintenance, it can break down.\n\nWix and Squarespace, on the other hand, cater to those who want a simpler, drag-and-drop solution. They\u2019re fantastic for small businesses just starting out but often lack the scalability needed as they grow. A client in Columbia once came to us frustrated that their Wix site couldn\u2019t handle the traffic spikes during their annual sale. We rebuilt their site on a more robust platform, ensuring it could grow alongside their business.\n\n\n\nThe Role of SEO in Modern Web Design\n\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) isn\u2019t just a buzzword; it\u2019s the lifeline of any website. Columbia SC website design services like ours incorporate SEO strategies right from the planning stage. But here\u2019s a reality check: even the best design can\u2019t mask poorly executed SEO. Google\u2019s algorithms are sophisticated, and they prioritize user experience above all else.\n\nOne of the common complaints we\u2019ve heard globally is about platforms like Shopify and Wix, where SEO capabilities are somewhat limited. While these platforms offer basic SEO features, they often fall short when compared to fully customizable options available on WordPress. That\u2019s why we emphasize starting with a clear SEO strategy, using tools like Semrush and Ahrefs to track performance, and continuously refining it.\n\nPart 2: The Heart of Columbia SC Website Design and What Lies Ahead\n\nColumbia\u2019s Unique Web Design Landscape\n\nColumbia, South Carolina, isn\u2019t just known for its southern charm and vibrant business community; it\u2019s also becoming a hotspot for innovative digital solutions. Web Design Columbia has been at the forefront, leveraging nearly two decades of experience to create designs that resonate with both local and global audiences. While the city might not have the tech reputation of Silicon Valley, it offers something unique\u2014a personal touch that prioritizes relationships over transactions.\n\nThis focus on collaboration sets Columbia, SC, website design apart. One memorable project involved a local nonprofit organization that needed to overhaul its aging Zen-Cart platform completely. We migrated their site to Shopify, ensuring a smooth transition without downtime. Here\u2019s the kicker: the new site\u2019s streamlined design and improved navigation led to a 200% increase in donor contributions within just three months. Success stories like these highlight the power of combining technical expertise with understanding community needs.\n\nWhen Design Meets Development\n\nYou can\u2019t talk about Columbia, SC, website design without diving into the synergy between design and development. Think of it like a duet: the designer sets the tone, and the developer brings the melody to life. But achieving harmony isn\u2019t always easy. Many businesses globally complain about miscommunication between these two roles, which can result in sites that look great but function poorly\u2014or vice versa.\n\nAt Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve found that fostering collaboration between designers and developers is key. We use tools like Figma for wireframing and prototyping, ensuring that everyone\u2014clients included\u2014has a clear vision of the final product. Interestingly, a 2022 survey revealed that 60% of website redesigns fail to meet client expectations due to a lack of proper planning. That\u2019s why we emphasize transparency and iteration, involving clients at every process stage.\n\nThe Downsides of Modern Web Trends\n\nWhile modern web design trends like minimalism and parallax scrolling can be visually stunning, they also have pitfalls. Minimalist designs, for example, often sacrifice functionality for aesthetics. A user might love a site\u2019s clean, open look but get frustrated when basic navigation isn\u2019t intuitive.\n\nAnother trend that divides opinion is parallax scrolling, in which background images move slower than foreground content to create a 3D effect. While this can add depth and dynamism, it can also lead to slower load times and compatibility issues on older devices. Columbia, SC, website design projects must carefully weigh these pros and cons.\n\nOne of our more challenging projects involved incorporating parallax elements into a local restaurant\u2019s website. The result was visually spectacular, but we quickly realized that some older browsers struggled to handle the animations. By optimizing the code and offering a simplified version for less capable devices, we struck a balance that satisfied all users.\n\nGlobal Inspirations, Local Applications\n\nWeb design is a global language, but its application varies by region. In Columbia, South Carolina, businesses value authenticity and practicality\u2014traits that don\u2019t always align with the flashy, experimental designs you might see in tech hubs like New York or San Francisco. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Columbia, SC, website design lacks innovation.\n\nWe often draw inspiration from global trends and adapt them to fit local sensibilities. Take the rise of dark mode, for instance. Platforms like Twitter and Slack initially popularized this feature and has been praised for reducing eye strain and saving device battery life. While dark mode is trendy, we\u2019ve found that it doesn\u2019t always suit every brand\u2019s identity. A local healthcare provider, for example, might benefit more from lighter, more calming color schemes.\n\nThe Future of Columbia SC Website Design\n\nLooking ahead, the future of web design in Columbia\u2014and globally\u2014is shaping up to be exciting and complex. Technologies like AI and machine learning are beginning to influence how websites are built and maintained. Tools like ChatGPT and MidJourney are already assisting with content creation and design ideation, but they\u2019re not without their limitations. AI lacks the nuance of human creativity, so it\u2019s better used as an assistant rather than a replacement.\n\nIn Columbia, businesses are starting to embrace these technologies, but cautiously. Web Design Columbia has experimented with AI-driven analytics tools to predict user behavior and optimize design choices. While these tools provide valuable insights, they\u2019re only as good as the data they\u2019re fed. As the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out.\n\nWhy Experience Matters\n\nIn an industry where trends change faster than you can say \u201cresponsive design,\u201d experience is a critical asset. Columbia, SC, website design firms like ours have weathered countless changes, from the rise of mobile-first strategies to the current emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity.\n\nOne interesting fact: according to a 2023 report, websites built by experienced teams are 50% more likely to meet their performance goals than those built by less seasoned developers. That\u2019s because experience isn\u2019t just about knowing what works; it\u2019s about knowing what doesn\u2019t. At Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve learned to anticipate challenges and adapt quickly, ensuring every project succeeds.\n\nYour Digital Journey Starts Here\n\nWeb design is more than just a service; it\u2019s a partnership. Whether you\u2019re looking to revamp an outdated site or build something entirely new, the team at Web Design Columbia is here to guide you every step of the way. With nearly two decades of experience, a commitment to quality, and a deep understanding of Columbia, SC, website design, we\u2019re ready to help your business thrive in the digital age.\n\nContact us today, and let\u2019s create something extraordinary together.

            "article_content": "The meme coin market has been buzzing, hasn\u2019t it? Every few months, a new quirky token emerges, setting the internet on fire and sending crypto enthusiasts into a frenzy. With the overall crypto market adapting to economic turbulence, meme coins have shown surprising resilience and creativity. Their blend of community spirit and innovative utility is a massive draw. If you thought 2023 was meme coin madness, wait till you see what 2024 has in store. Among this vibrant chaos, one coin that\u2019s stealing the show is BTFD Coin (BTFD). Let\u2019s just say, if you\u2019re chasing returns, you might want to keep reading.\n\nBTFD Coin isn\u2019t just riding the meme coin wave \u2013 it\u2019s redefining it. With a thriving presale already crossing $4.44 million and groundbreaking features like its Play 2 Earn (P2E) game, referral programme, and staking with a juicy 90% APY, it\u2019s attracting investors like flies to a barbecue. If you\u2019re looking for the best meme coins for massive income, you\u2019ll want to stick around as we explore this coin and its competitors.\n\n1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin to Watch\n\nWhat sets BTFD Coin apart? A whole lot, actually. From its quirky name (a cheeky nod to the phrase \u201cbuy the dip\u201d) to its feature-packed ecosystem, this token is the new superstar in town. Its presale launched at an eyebrow-raising $0.000004 per coin and has now reached Stage 12, priced at $0.000064. Analysts are predicting fireworks, with a listing price of $0.0006 post-presale. BTFD\u2019s referral programme and 90% staking APY are also luring savvy investors.\n\nThe coin\u2019s Play 2 Earn game is a major talking point. Although it\u2019s still in beta (launched in Stage 10), the full version promises rewards that could rival established P2E platforms. For those who love to hustle, BTFD\u2019s referral programme is pure gold. With every new investor brought on board, you earn additional rewards. And did we mention the Bulls Squad? This elite community is rallying hard to push the token\u2019s value to new heights.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Because it\u2019s a juggernaut in the making.

As the pioneer of the meme coin world, it\u2019s been a darling of the internet and a plaything for whales. DOGE owes much of its stardom to endorsements from the likes of Elon Musk, whose tweets alone can send it soaring. Its simplicity and absurdity\u2014a Shiba Inu dog on a coin\u2014made it a pop culture phenomenon.\n\nUnlike many meme coins, Dogecoin has stayed relevant by being surprisingly practical. It\u2019s fast, has low transaction fees, and boasts one of the largest communities in the crypto world. The coin\u2019s use in tipping and small-scale payments has helped it secure a spot in everyday crypto usage. Plus, with ongoing discussions about integrating DOGE into platforms like X (formerly Twitter), it\u2019s clear this meme coin isn\u2019t just a fad.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Simply put, it\u2019s a legend. Dogecoin remains a cornerstone of the meme coin ecosystem and is one of the best meme coins for massive income for investors who value stability alongside fun.\n\n3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Dogecoin Killer\n\nShiba Inu entered the crypto stage as the self-proclaimed \u201cDogecoin Killer.\u201d While that may have sounded ambitious at the time, SHIB\u2019s rise was nothing short of spectacular. This Ethereum-based token launched with a decentralised vibe, and its ShibaSwap platform added a level of utility most meme coins can only dream about.\n\n2024 has been a transformative year for SHIB. Its developers are working on Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain solution to lower transaction costs and increase speed. Combine this with the ShibaSwap ecosystem and its NFT ventures, and you\u2019ve got a meme coin with serious utility backing its meme appeal. Its massive, devoted community (nicknamed the SHIB Army) and innovative features make it a top contender in the meme coin race.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Because Shiba Inu has moved beyond being a meme coin. Its utility and ambitious plans for the future cement its position as one of the best meme coins for massive income.\n\n4. Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Dark Horse\n\nAh, Pepe Coin. What started as an internet joke became a decentralised sensation in the meme coin market. Inspired by the infamous frog meme, PEPE has a devoted, albeit niche, following. The coin thrives on its community\u2019s creativity and humour, often launching viral campaigns that boost its visibility and trading volume.\n\nIn 2024, PEPE has proven it\u2019s not just a flash in the pan.

            "article_content": "An artist's impression of a hot exoplanet.\n\nAstronomers have unveiled the discovery of two Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting a star more than 40 light-years from our planet, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing quest to identify potentially habitable worlds beyond our solar system. A team of researchers have outlined their findings in a paper published on the pre-print server arXiv and shared by phys.org. The star, HD 101581, also catalogued as GJ 435, is a K5V-type orange dwarf star located about 42 light years away. The two confirmed exoplanets, designated HD 101581 b and HD 101581 c, were identified through meticulous observations using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during its 63rd and 64th observation sectors. These planets exhibit radii comparable to Earth's, with HD 101581 b measuring approximately 0.956 times Earth's radius and HD 101581 c about 0.990 times. Their orbital periods are notably brief, with HD 101581 b completing a revolution around its host star every 4.47 days and HD 101581 c every 6.21 days.\n\nArtist's impression of the James Webb Telescope.\n\nAdditionally, a third candidate planet, HD 101581 d, has been detected, though its existence awaits further confirmation. If validated, this planet would also be Earth-sized, with an orbital period of approximately 7.9 days. The discovery of these Earth-sized exoplanets is especially compelling due to their relative proximity to our solar system, which facilitates more detailed study. Nevertheless, their close orbits to HD 101581 suggest that they are subjected to intense stellar radiation, resulting in higher surface temperatures than Earth's. This likely renders them inhospitable to life as we know it. Despite the remote possibility that they could harbour life, the planets offer invaluable opportunities for scientific investigation.\n\nRecent images from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Such research contributes to the broader objective of identifying Earth-like planets within habitable zones, where conditions may be conducive to life. This discovery arrives at a pivotal moment. The astronomical community anticipates a surge in exoplanet research in 2025, propelled by data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Launched in December 2021, the JWST has already demonstrated its capacity to observe distant cosmic phenomena with unprecedented clarity.\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope captures Ring Nebula in \u2018unprecedented detail\u2019\n\nTrending"

We cannot allow a generation of children to become collateral damage to the world\u2019s unchecked wars,\u201d the director said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proportion of children living in areas of conflict has doubled \u2013 from about 10 percent in the 1990s to almost 19 percent today, UNICEF said.\n\nAccording to the report, 47.2 million children were displaced due to conflict and violence by the end of 2023.\n\nThe trends for 2024 indicate a further increase in displacement because various conflicts have intensified, including in Haiti, Lebanon, Myanmar, the Palestinian territories and Sudan.\n\nAdditionally, in the latest available data, from 2023, the UN verified a record 32,990 grave violations against 22,557 children \u2013 the highest number since UN Security Council-mandated monitoring began, UNICEF said.\n\nThere is an overall upward trend in the number of grave violations, with this year likely to see another increase, as \u201cthousands of children have been killed and injured in Gaza, and in Ukraine\u201d, the agency said.\n\nSexual violence against children has surged, their education has been affected, children\u2019s malnutrition rates have risen and armed conflicts have taken a larger toll on children\u2019s mental health, UNICEF also reported.\n\n\u201cThe world is failing these children. As we look towards 2025, we must do more to turn the tide and save and improve the lives of children,\u201d Russell said.\n\nGaza\u2019s children \u2018cold, sick, traumatised\u2019\n\nIn Gaza \u2013 where the Israeli military has killed more women and children in the past year than in any recent conflict over a single year, Oxfam reported in September \u2013 the ongoing war is a \u201cnightmare\u201d for children, UNICEF Communication Specialist Rosalia Bollen said last week at a media briefing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cChildren in Gaza are cold, sick and traumatised,\u201d Bollen said last Friday.\n\nAbout 96 percent of women and children in Gaza cannot meet their basic nutritional needs, she said, lamenting the lack of aid able to reach children in the Strip.\n\n\u201cGaza must be one of the most heartbreaking places on Earth for humanitarians. Every small effort to save a child\u2019s life is undone by fierce devastation,\u201d said Bollen.\n\n\u201cFor over 14 months, children have been at the sharp edge of this nightmare.\u201d\n\nBollen said that many children in the besieged enclave don\u2019t have winter clothes, have to resort to searching through rubbish for provisions and are plagued with diseases.\n\nShe urged the use of political capital and diplomatic leverage to push for the evacuation of injured children and their parents to leave Gaza and seek medical care in East Jerusalem or elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThis war should haunt every one of us. Gaza\u2019s children cannot wait,\u201d she pressed."

            "article_content": "Looking to the past to predict the future in the stock market isn't always accurate, as companies are constantly changing alongside the broader market. However, it can be useful to see how a stock performed when it reached similar valuation or growth levels, especially with cyclical companies.\n\nI recently did this with Meta Platforms (META -0.59%), and it revealed some incredible results I think investors must pay attention to heading into 2025.\n\nMeta Platforms provides solid growth at a reasonable price\n\nWhile most people wouldn't think of Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, as a cyclical business, it is. Meta derives nearly all its revenue from advertising, which ebbs and flows with business sentiment. If advertising clients think there will be significant consumer spending in the coming months, they'll advertise more heavily than they would if the economy were in a recession.\n\nWith Meta's revenue growing at a healthy pace, it's clear that advertisers believe consumers will maintain their spending levels. This is similar to 2019 through 2021 (besides a slight blip thanks to COVID).\n\nAlthough the revenue growth rate was slightly higher in 2019 through 2021, the general sentiment and range of growth are about the same. Furthermore, the valuation looks similar on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis.\n\nSo, Meta is growing and priced similarly to what it was from 2019 to 2021. How did it perform? Quite well.\n\nMeta's stock saw massive gains over those three years, and I wouldn't be surprised if it had a solid 2025, as history favors Meta.\n\nMeta is reasonably priced heading into 2025\n\nWith Meta's stock having a solid history to stand on when the stock was valued and growing revenue at a similar pace as in the past, investors are right to be excited about 2025. However, a few points need to be noted.\n\nFor 2025, Wall Street analysts expect Meta's revenue growth to be about 15%. This is notably slower than the 2019 to 2021 range, but it still shows strong growth, considering Meta is a huge company.\n\nWith Meta being a mature company, most investors focus on profit growth rather than revenue growth. That could take a hit in 2025, as management has already warned investors that there will be a \"significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year.\"\n\nThis is largely centered around its artificial intelligence (AI) investments, as it needs to continue building out computing power to capture market share in this important field. Still, Wall Street analysts expect 12% earnings-per-share (EPS) growth in 2025, so the increased spending won't affect its earnings too much.\n\nDespite a slowdown in growth and increased spending, Meta Platforms is still one of the cheapest big tech stocks on the market. If you compare it to other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla, Meta is the second-cheapest stock when valued using trailing or forward earnings.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean it's growing slowly, either. Meta's Q3 revenue growth was the second-fastest in the group, showcasing Meta's reasonable price for strong growth.\n\nAlthough the setup for Meta isn't exactly the same as it was from 2019 to 2021, there are many similarities. Throw in that Meta is reasonably priced compared to many of its peers, and I think you have a recipe for a stock that can put up impressive returns in 2025. As a result, Meta is one of my best stocks to buy for 2025."

            "article_content": "Scientists and emergency managers are trying to learn from disasters past.\n\nThese are the billion-dollar disasters of 2024: Why analyzing them matters\n\nThe amount of damage caused by billion-dollar disasters reached an unprecedented amount in 2024, and the total cost of the destruction is still growing, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nAs of Nov. 1, there have been 24 confirmed weather or climate disaster events in the U.S with losses exceeding $1 billion, according to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, which compiles an annual report that details the billion-dollar disasters of the year.\n\nThe billion-dollar disasters include 17 severe storm events, four tropical cyclone events, one wildfire event and two winter storm events. Combined, the billion-dollar disasters of 2024 resulted in at least 418 fatalities and caused significant economic loss in the regions impacted, according to NOAA.\n\nIn this May 22, 2024, file photo, residents and first responders go through the damage after a tornado tore through Greenfield, Iowa. Multiple deaths and injuries were reported from a series of tornadoes and powerful storms that hit several Midwestern states. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe cost of the damage from billion-dollar disasters is so extensive for 2024 that NOAA is still tallying up the final numbers on several events, Adam Smith, an applied climatologist at NOAA, told ABC News. The full report will be released on Jan. 9, according to NOAA.\n\nThe agency has been tracking billion-dollar disasters in the U.S. since 1980, analyzing the most impactful and most common weather and climate hazards annually, Smith said. These types of events can include drought, wildfire, hurricanes, flooding, heat waves, winter storms and severe storms that contain threats like hail and high wind damage, Smith said.\n\nThe silver lining of analyzing the most expensive disasters allows scientists and emergency managers to learn from them, Smith added.\n\n\"From all of this, we're trying to show how the frequency and the cost of these impacts affect American lives and livelihoods in different regions in different states, using the best public and private sector data partners,\" Smith said. \"It provides a climatology of showing where the hot spots are across the country from year to year for different weather and climate extremes.\"\n\nCost of disaster\n\nFour hundred billion-dollar disasters have occurred since then, exceeding losses of $2.78 trillion, according to the agency.\n\nIn this Oct. 10, 2024, file photo, an aerial view shows destruction at the Spanish Lakes country club in Fort Pierce, Florida, in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton. John Falchetto/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nAnd the number of climate and weather events to exceed $1 billion in losses has been growing exponentially in the last several decades, Smith said.\n\nWhile the annual average number of billion-dollar disasters between 1980 and 2023 is 8.5 events, the annual average from the past five years is 20.4 events per year, according to NOAA.\n\nThe frequency has been increasing rapidly since about 2009-2010, according to a model designed by Charchit Shukla, a Ph.D student in industrial and manufacturing systems engineering at Iowa State University.\n\nWhile the impacts of many major weather-related events are being amplified by climate change, the combination between a growing population and more infrastructure on the coast are also to blame for the way weather and climate disasters are impacting communities, Cameron MacKenzie, associate professor in industrial and manufacturing systems engineering at Iowa State University, told ABC News.\n\nThese are some of the most impactful billion-dollar disasters of 2024:\n\nHurricane Helene\n\nHurricanes were, by far, the most impactful weather-related disasters on humanity and the economy in 2024, Smith said. Over the past 45 years, tropical cyclones have inflicted more than $1 trillion in damage, Smith said.\n\nIn this Sept. 27, 2024, aerial view, power crews work on the lines after Hurricane Helene passed offshore in Crystal River, Florida. Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida's Big Bend with winds up to 140 mph and storm surges. Joe Raedle/Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"They're very powerful destructive events, with multiple hazards: storm surge, high wind and, of course, flooding, along our coastlines -- and even inland from the coast, we have a lot of population, a lot of assets at risk,\" he said.\n\nThe back-to-back hurricanes that barreled into the Gulf Coast of Florida before causing widespread damage far beyond initial landfall began with Hurricane Helene.\n\nHelene made landfall on Florida's Big Bend as a Category 4 storm on Sept. 24 bringing up to 15 feet of storm surge to the coast before causing damage in Georgia, western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic flash flooding once it reached the mountain region of Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nIn this Sept. 29, 2024, file photo, Swannanoa, N.C., residents walk through devastating flood damage from the Swannanoa River. The remnants of Hurricane Helene caused widespread flooding, downed trees, and power outages in western North Carolina. Travis Long/The News & Observer TNS via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe impacts as Helene made its track were \"quite extreme\" and extensive, Smith said.\n\nThe storm killed 225 people, according to NOAA. The full extent of the damage has yet to be determined.\n\nHurricane Milton\n\nCommunities all over the Southeast were still reeling from Helene when Hurricane Milton made landfall near Siesta Key, Florida, on Oct. 9.\n\nThe Category 3 storm brought storm surge up to 10 feet along the coast and spawned dozens of tornadoes across the southern peninsula of Florida that damaged homes, businesses vehicles and other infrastructure.\n\nIn this Oct. 10, 2024, file photo, a drone image shows the dome of Tropicana Field which has been torn open due to Hurricane Milton in St. Petersburg, Fla. Bryan R. Smith/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton combined will likely tally above $100 billion combined, Smith said, adding that the extent of the damage is still being assessed.\n\n\"Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton hitting the west coast of Florida within two weeks of each other was quite anomalous,\" Smith said. \"And that's a compound disaster with cascading impacts.\"\n\nTwenty-four people died as a result of Milton, according to NOAA.\n\nHurricanes Debby and Beryl\n\nTwo Category 1 storms proved they were well capable of causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nHurricane Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, on Aug. 5 before it made a second landfall near Bulls Bay, South Carolina, three days layer.\n\nIn this Aug. 7, 2024, file photo, an Arby's restaurant looks devastated by a tornado associated with Tropical Storm Debby, in Moncks Corner, South Carolina. Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo/Getty Images, FILE\n\nAfter its initial landfall, Debby marched up the East Coast, bringing heavy rain, flash flooding, river flooding and strong winds to several states. The remnants of the storm fueled flooding across parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and southeastern New York as it merged with another system in the region. The stretch of unsettled weather also produced an EF-1 tornado that impacted Buffalo, New York.\n\nHurricane Beryl was the second named storm of the season, making landfall in Texas on July 8, where it produced widespread high wind damage as the storm and caused significant power outages for millions of people for several days.\n\nBeryl also produced more than 50 tornadoes across eastern Texas, western Louisiana and southern Arkansas.\n\nIn this July 8, 2024, file photo, an aerial view shows a destroyed home in Surfside Beach, Texas, after Hurricane Beryl made landfall. Mark Felix/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nDebby is estimated to have caused $2.5 billion in damage, while Beryl is estimated to have caused $7.2 billion in damage according to NOAA.\n\nTornado outbreaks\n\nBetween June 24 and 26, states like Nebraska, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Massachusetts were impacted by severe thunderstorms that brought tornadoes, damaging winds and hail. The notable events include an EF-3 tornado hit Whitman, Nebraska, and the surrounding area as well as a tornado that impacted Providence County, Rhode Island.\n\nThat event cost about $1.7 billion in damage, according to NOAA.\n\nThe Central and Eastern U.S. experienced an outbreak of more than 79 tornadoes that developed between July 13 and July 16.\n\nIn this June 6, 2024, file photo a badly damaged home can be seen on Dogwood Drive in Gaithersburg, Maryland, after the home was hit by a fallen tree. The tornado that hit last night caused injuries to five people who were in this house when the twister struck. Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThirty-two tornadoes that spawned on July 15 broke the record for the Chicago region for the most tornadoes in one day.\n\nOther states that saw the most impact were Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and New York. Considerable damage to homes, businesses and other businesses were recorded.\n\nMore than 1,000 reports of high wind and hail damage were also recorded during the multi-day event, which is estimated to have cost $2.4 billion.\n\nNew Mexico wildfires\n\nMultiple wildfires that sparked in New Mexico from June 17 to July 7 damaged homes, vehicles, businesses, agriculture and other infrastructure.\n\nIn this June 20, 2024, file photo, burnt cars and structures are shown as the South Fork Fire continues in Ruidoso, New Mexico. Anadolu via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe South Fork Fire, near the town of Ruidoso, was the most impactful. Spreading rapidly due to strong winds, the South Fork Fire destroyed more than 1,000 structures.\n\nThe New Mexico wildfires caused an estimated $1.7 billion in damage, according to NOAA."

            "article_content": "\n\n\n\nThe US Congress has been attempting to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs - as our maps show the places in the UK and America most likely to be visited by extra-terrestrials.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023. That was a 20% drop from 497 UFO sightings in 2022 and also lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484).\n\nIt found that people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39).\n\nREAD MORE: The Saturday night when 85 cows thundered through a Somerset town\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: Gorgeous Somerset cafe which perfects cake for the kids and coffee for the parents\n\nYou can see what UFO encounters have been reported where you live using our interactive map.\n\n\n\n\n\nSightings documented in the UK included:\n\n\n\nA \u201clong cigar-shaped craft with three or four roundish patterns on it\u201d was observed for 20 minutes before it \u201cvanished like a light being switched off\u201d above Chester in Cheshire in October last year.\n\nA \u201crocket-type object\u201d was spotted flying above the clouds over Hartlepool \u201cextremely fast and soundless with flames over the front\u201d in November 2022.\n\nA 30ft to 40ft wide \u201cround saucer-like object with detailed outer rim\u201d was seen \u201chovering over a house\u201d in Bedworth, Warwickshire, in January.\n\nSome Somerset sightings include two round discs, a dull red colour, following the flight path of an aircraft with no sound unlike the aircraft over Shepton Mallet, a moving light disappeared at Orion. Followed by multiple other lights all in the same place moving West to East over Glastonbury, and a tic-tac like shape moving very slowly in the sky above Spaxton.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings (48%) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25%) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17%), \u201csphere\u201d, (10%) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (9%).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34). When it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts. Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold - former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team - told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d. However, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US submarines and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government - or any other government - are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d He insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by Chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies. While the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be."

The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nUsers local to the New York City area confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nOther users deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious, and was shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "I.\n\nOnly the future of the workers' movement will decide the fate of the May 1968 movement. What it was will only be revealed when the last word is said on socialism. Seeking the objective meaning of the May days is a futile enterprise and betrays in those who indulge in it a contemplative curiosity without the slightest grasp on reality. But we can try right now to give meaning to what was, since we know what the future should be. The secret of historical necessity eludes us. Only the past was necessary, but its necessity does not commit the future in an absolute manner. Socialism will only be a historical necessity when history has allowed its realization. Socialism as we imagine it \u2014 imagining socialism being for us a permanent task \u2014 falls within the realm of the possible and the subjective; it is above all a matter of conscience and only secondarily a matter of science. The past belongs to science, the future to conscience. It is not enough to know a lot to move towards socialism, but we will not get there without having previously and consciously imagined and wanted it. Socialism is Utopia as a creative project made of science and ideal, of knowledge and will.\n\nThis is the meaning we give to the movement we have just experienced. We derive it as much from the attitude of the students and workers as from the literary manifestations to which the first gave rise. The paving stone and the sentence have the meaning we give them, and this meaning will only be true when the revolution is made. We choose the meaning of the movement as we choose the revolution. The truth of this choice is only a postulate as long as the demonstration is not provided by history.\n\nII.\n\nDid the debauchery of literature provoked by the events of May help the workers and students in revolt to better understand the meaning of their struggle? One can doubt it. In addition to the proliferation of sectarian phraseology of politically engaged young people, who are therefore little inclined to rethink the situation based on a new experience, one could read learned analyses whose authors, without even questioning their own role in the future of the society targeted by the \"protest\", did not wait for events to settle down to rationalize and prophesy to one another. The most improbable analogies and historical evocations took the place of reflection on the disarray of minds and the impotence of gestures on the one hand, and on the fundamental project on the other. Because if today resembles yesterday, it is above all because past and present are linked by the same defeat. The veneration of failure has taken the form of a cult; worker heroism seems all the more glorious when it results in the triumph of the enemy. Nothing is more masochistic than the historiography of the workers' movement. Thus, the greatest defeat suffered by the modern proletariat is considered universally \u2014 and often by the victims themselves \u2014 as the greatest victory: the Russian revolution of 1917 is considered to be \"proletarian\" and \"socialist\", when it only allowed the creation of a modern proletariat in a State whose institutions all express the negation of socialism, whatever it may be, utopian or scientific . In this respect, it can be said that the ignorance and unconsciousness of the left-wing intelligentsia are equal to its bad faith. There is no worse enemy of the proletariat and of socialism than the left-wing intellectual who agrees to be an accomplice in the greatest mystification of the century: Soviet socialism.\n\nIII.\n\nThe convergence of the student and workers' movements contains the secret of the revolutionary struggles to come; at the same time, it prefigures the essential tendency of the future social transformation.\n\nLinked to a revolutionary goal, the general strike becomes the supreme weapon of the modern proletariat; it reveals the real power of the producers who, at any moment, can stop, or even destroy, the apparatus of production that dominates and oppresses them. The occupation of workplaces symbolizes the future mode of appropriation of productive goods on behalf of society. In France, before the First World War, the theory and practice of the general strike found fertile ground in revolutionary syndicalism, which is the finest lesson that the international workers' movement could give itself in terms of self-emancipation. More than ever, the work of Georges Sorel should be brought out of oblivion and discussed. For it is no coincidence that this thinker was the first in the West to recognize the deep affinities between revolutionary syndicalism and the soviet movement. And his presence will not be superfluous when the New Utopia takes stock of the spiritual heritage that the council movement will inherit. There is here a set of historical and intellectual elements which constitute an inexhaustible source from which the theory of council socialism will draw. But Sorel\u2014no more than Marx\u2014should not be accepted in the totality of his thought. The New Utopia will be made of theory and imagination, calculation and invention, old and new; it will not attach itself to any authority, to any name, to any genius other than that of the anonymous masses who, by inspiring the thinkers of the revolution, allowed them to say and paint their dreams.\n\nIn May 1968, students, through their gestures of total protest \u2014 although ineffective in the last resort \u2014 communicated to workers that spirit of refusal which is the first condition of revolutionary struggle. The student revolt \u2014 which threw disarray into the minds of professional thinkers on the lookout for historical models \u2014 had nothing comparable to an event such as the Commune of 1871. There was not and could not be a \"student Commune\", but nostalgia for the glorious past was enough to plunge certain minds into revolutionary mythology. The simultaneity of the action unleashed in the universities and in the factories is in itself full of lessons; It revealed that the workers' movement has no truth except as a total fact, both material and spiritual: the paving stone in the student's hand represented, rather than expressed, the negation of the established order, while the occupation of the factory and the office concretized, if only temporarily, the expropriation of the propertied class and the challenge to the authority of the employers and to state power. What the workers did, the students thought; emanating from two separate movements, action and idea went hand in hand to ultimately lead to failure. And this was all the more fatal because the revolutionary finality, instinctively felt by the worker, only presented itself in the consciousness of the students in a confused and contradictory way: Marxism \u2014 especially in its Leninist disguise \u2014 was, in the days of May, the ideological factor which sterilized rather than fertilized the revolutionary awareness among the workers and students.\n\nAlthough mostly negative, the lesson of May is of capital importance for the future of the movement: council socialism will either be realized as a utopia or it will not be realized. The New Utopia, conceived by the student, must, in order to become a reality, enter the consciousness and imagination of the worker.\n\nIV.\n\nMarx did not abolish utopia; on the contrary, he renewed its meaning by broadening its sphere of application. For him, utopia becomes a single process in two stages: revolution and creation. Before him, the utopians imagined and thought of creation independently of the men by whom the new city was to be built; at most, they counted on an elite. Marx saw men first; in this sense, he is the most utopian of utopians: little concerned with the future society, he is concerned only with the destruction of the present society and with the consciousness of the class that elevates revolution to the rank of a total requirement. If Marx refused to offer \"recipes for the pots of the future\", it is because his goal was more radical, more utopian in a sense, than that of his precursors: he wanted the end of prehistory, the advent of human society, the birth of man to be the work of \"the most numerous and most deprived class\" and not that of an inspired revolutionary minority. Having made his own the goal of the utopians, he preferred to consider the means of achieving it instead of repeating the criticisms and descriptions of his masters. The utopia of the revolution becomes with him an ethics of revolutionary behavior, an ethics that he wanted to base on a theory of history. Such is the meaning of this \"new materialism\", in other words of this \"materialist sociology\" that he summarized in a few lines in the Foreword to The Critique of Political Economy (1859). Engels and, after him, the whole school, obscured the problem by opposing science and utopia. Marx wanted to support, demonstrate, utopia by science in order to reconcile the two. Science does not engage action, its domain is abstraction and not practice which is application; its only aim is to demonstrate its possibilities and limits; on the other hand, utopia gives meaning to action and proposes ends to be achieved, but its practical solutions have proven ephemeral. Thus, certain utopians (Cabet, Owen) go so far as to create models in the hope of seeing their example imitated. Marx will reject these illusory solutions but will keep the fixed ends by expressing them using a more abstract terminology \u2014 classless society, without State, without money, dictatorship of the proletariat, integral man.\n\nV.\n\nThe chances of council socialism are linked to the workers' awareness, not of any social theory (Marxist or not), but of a system of values, let's say of an ethic. The students in revolt do not all adhere to a doctrine and those who claim to be Marxists are divided into several tendencies which never cease to fight each other. And yet, recent events have shown that a common attitude could be adopted by politically divided students and workers, but united in the negation and refusal of a social order considered and felt to be harmful. Bourgeois morality erects the alienation of man as a universal norm; so-called communist morality rivals bourgeois morality in respecting these same values \u200b\u200bthat bourgeois and communists mutually accuse each other of \"betraying\". And the world is perishing under the threat that this escalation poses to it. Man is sacrificed to bourgeois and communist \"humanism\". The two moralities differ only in the degree of hypocrisy and imposture that each of them manifests in its proclamations of virtue and humanity.\n\nThis is what the student revolt was directed against, thus giving full meaning to the virtually insurrectional strike of the workers. Instinct and spontaneity predominated in both camps, and yet it was the same fundamental call that graffiti, posters, and drawings clearly translated, announcing the reign of the New Utopia. The immense critical force, long contained or stifled, of socialism, anarchy, and revolutionary syndicalism had just exploded: spreading to all minds, it was immediately a firework display of subversive ideas that burst into the press and tracts, to finally degenerate into literature.\n\nIt is possible that the fight will resume, in France and elsewhere, in the East as in the West. But for future struggles to become something other than material for literature, other than a new chapter in the history of the glorious defeats of the working class, we should ask ourselves less about the causes of these permanent failures than we should try to define the objectives to be achieved and the means to be employed; in short, we should imagine the New Utopia.\n\nVI.\n\nOne can conceive, as a first step, of the constitution of an international movement for council socialism which would set itself the initial task of proclaiming its charter of values. This movement could be constituted openly in countries of \"formal\" democracy \u2014 where freedom of expression and association are respected as much as the freedom to exploit the labor force \u2014 and secretly in countries decreed socialist by the grace of state power \u2014 where free criticism, guaranteed by the constitution, can lead and often leads to the loss of physical freedom, of the right of habeas corpus . For, the height of mystification, we have come quite naturally to denounce the enslavement of man by capital, under the bourgeois regime, while we accept, without the slightest criticism, the total submission of man to state power in countries where it is no longer private capital which is the master. The new movement will have to face this dilemma: either to note that the division of the world into capitalist countries and socialist countries is a poor myth systematically maintained by the two systems of exploitation and domination; it will then have to imagine, from this observation, the New Utopia; or to accept this false division which leads to the acceptance of a war of total destruction, thus forcing one to abandon oneself to fate. It is better to consider that everything still remains to be built than to see socialism where it does not exist.\n\nVII.\n\nThe charter of values \u200b\u200bof council socialism will be critical and ethical. As a critique of current modes of social domination, it will be the condemnation of all established regimes, whether liberal or totalitarian, capitalist or pseudo-socialist. As an ethic, it will constitute itself the heir to the spiritual heritage bequeathed by socialist thinkers of all times and all places. Whether they are utopian or scientific. The thought of socialism is in no way the prerogative of those who have claimed it and who, today, claim to adhere to it. It predates the schools and professions of faith openly proclaimed socialist. It is present, implicitly or explicitly, in all schools of wisdom since Greco-Latin and Eastern antiquity, it survives in the religious heresies of the Middle Ages and Modern Times, it takes a concrete form in the imaginations of the utopians; and as for the writings of the so-called \"scientific\" socialists \u2014 starting with the \"founding fathers\" \u2014 they are steeped in a spirit of egalitarian ethics, which also predates its translation into terms of theory . One will search in vain for a more utopian, and therefore more ethical, vision of a communist society than that set out in the most famous charter of so-called scientific socialism: \"The old bourgeois society, with its classes and class conflicts, gives way to an association where the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all\". (The Communist Manifesto)\n\nVIII.\n\nThe movement of workers' councils must be prepared in the minds before being externalized in revolutionary actions, the most decisive of which will be the insurrectional and managerial strike, conceived as the supreme violence by the very fact that it will disarm the class enemy and reduce it to impotence. The entire strategy of non-violence finds its triumphant expression in this strike. Thus can be realized the imperative that Georges Sorel defined as the necessity of \"preserving the revolution's character of absolute and irreformable transformation\" which gives socialism \"its high educational value\" (Reflections on Violence, p. 238). The preparation of minds is an integral part of revolutionary action. By constituting themselves in councils, the workers enter into the first phase of an action which includes several, before and after the outbreak of the general insurrectional strike, the decisive stage being that of the passage to the execution of the management plan. What the unions and the workers' parties have been unable to achieve, the workers' councils make their essential task: to be the schools of socialism first, and the organs of management of the socialist economy next .\n\nThe constitution of workers' councils as schools of socialism and embryos of the future workers' power inaugurates the revolutionary process; it is the best guarantee of the success of a movement which will be that of the \"most numerous and most miserable class\", that of the alienated producers conscious of their alienation and given themselves the mission of realizing their own emancipation and working for the liberation of humanity. No vanguard, no general staff, no elite, however immense the political genius of the leaders who guide them, can substitute themselves for the entire working class in the accomplishment of this emancipatory task. The old structures of the workers' movement were in the image of bourgeois society. The unions and workers' parties, while publicly displaying a revolutionary aim, were, by their very nature, linked to the institutions of the society which they aimed to transform. Caught in their own game, they ended up ensuring the continuity of the social system which they claimed to overthrow. From a moral point of view, their modes of action could not appear otherwise than as a permanent \"betrayal\"; but if appearances show the \"immorality\" of the unions and workers' parties, the sociological analysis of the mechanism of the system obliges us to recognize the fatal character of this betrayal and this immorality. In fact, parties and unions expressed the will of a non-revolutionary class, always ready to bargain its labor power and its freedom at the best price. Depending on the circumstances, this bargaining could bring more or less immediate advantages to the combatants, but the stakes of the fight did not endanger the existence of the exploiting class and the State.\n\nWhat the classical organisations of the working class could not achieve in the past and probably will not succeed in achieving in the future, the new movement has the best chance of accomplishing: it is, to use the words of Rosa Luxemburg (who was then thinking of workers' parties), the very movement of the working class. By constituting themselves in councils, the workers take their destiny into their own hands and undertake that historic initiative which the Communist Manifesto makes the condition of their triumph.\n\nIX.\n\nWorkers' councils are the form of organization that is most capable of promoting, in the living conditions of mass society, the actions of self-emancipation on which the success of the movement depends. A gathering of individuals who are conscious of themselves and convinced of the revolutionary purpose of their struggle, the council is both an end and a means, in contrast to the union and the party which maneuver the anonymous mass of their members to make them serve ends foreign to, or even opposed to, the class they are supposed to represent. By its reduced dimensions, the council can escape anonymity and the alienation of its power. The individual can remain himself there, and if he changes himself, it is under the direct influence of those he rubs shoulders with and whom he changes in turn. Self-education is inseparable from common education, each member bringing to the council \u2014 which is a microcosm of reflection and creation \u2014 his individual gifts and generosity, so that each one enriches himself by spending himself: before becoming the constitutive cell of the new society, the council prefigures it in the behavior of its members.\n\nThis anticipation will only seem chimerical to those who are unaware of the history of acts and gestures of self-emancipation, less visible and less graspable than the loudly reported highlights of the workers' epic that marked the workers' movement from its beginnings to recent years. The history of these manifestations of the workers' movement, while still little known, nonetheless offers a great wealth of constituent elements for imagining and building the New Utopia that a dying world calls for. The universal crisis of which we are today witnesses and victims makes the return to Utopia appear as the only rational outcome left to a humanity threatened with extinction. The supposed realism of the men who govern humanity is only the insane expression of this agony and this threat. Statesmen, whatever their \"greatness\", are, by their state of mind, contemporaries of the troglodytes. In the East as in the West the same madness reigns; only the degree and the form vary.\n\nIt is against this universal reign of insane stupidity that students and workers rose up in France and elsewhere: they were not always aware of it, but such was the profound meaning of their gesture, and it is this hidden meaning of their action which transforms the failure\n\nin success. Others have understood it better than them and, among them, the supporters of the regime have had to throw off the mask. They suddenly had the vision of the end of the world, of the world that was theirs. They know that from now on the path is traced for the revolution that was looking for itself; they know that the stakes are total. They are preparing themselves for an existence of troglodytes, in harmony with their conscience. If they fail, the revolution will have saved them in spite of themselves. Because from now on the revolutionary finality coincides with the biological finality tout court, and the revolution has become the categorical imperative for any man who wants to survive and avoid sinking into a pre-human existence.\n\nX.\n\nIf we persist in giving the word \"utopia\" the meaning of unreal and unrealizable, the reform projects proposed by the ruling classes and political masters of the contemporary world are more utopian, and therefore more unreal and unrealizable, than the models of society imagined from Plato to Wells. All these thinkers have sensed and foreseen the catastrophic course of a historical development given over to the instinct of domination of the possessing classes and of deranged individuals ready to sacrifice the salvation of the species to their thirst for power. Karl Marx, who had the genius to express the most utopian vision in terms of science, once spoke to English proletarians about the threat that a humanity that has reached the height of its technical inventions will have to face. His speech was therefore addressed to us, who have survived two world wars, Nazism, fascism and Stalinism, and who see preparing in bloody preludes a probably fatal confrontation between two worlds that are of the same essence, since the political systems that govern them represent, in different disguises, the same absolute disdain for the mass man, for the average individual subjected to the most misleading political, philosophical and religious propaganda. That Marx chose an audience of workers to deliver the apocalyptic remarks that we are about to read will only surprise those who, Marxists or not, have never understood that, through the mouth of the author of Capital, is expressed just as much the spiritual, therefore absolute, message of the workers' movement and socialism as the scientific, therefore relative, truth of a thinker of genius:\n\n\"There is a striking fact which characterizes our century, a fact which no political party would dare to contest. On the one hand we have seen the birth of industrial and scientific forces which could not have been imagined at any previous period of human history. On the other hand we perceive the symptoms of a catastrophe such as will eclipse even the famous horrors of the end of the Roman Empire. In our day, everything seems pregnant with its opposite. The machine has the marvelous power of shortening work and making it more productive; we see it starving and overworking the workers. By some strange evil spell of fate, the new sources of wealth are transformed into sources of distress. The victories of technology seem to be obtained at the price of moral decay. As humanity becomes master of nature, man seems to become a slave to his fellow men or to his own infamy. It seems as if even the pure light of science needs, in order to shine, the darkness of ignorance and that all our inventions and all our progress have only one aim: to endow material forces with life and intelligence and to reduce human life to a material force. This contrast of modern industry and science on the one hand, with modern misery and dissolution on the other; This antagonism between the productive forces and the social relations of our time is a fact of overwhelming evidence that no one would dare deny. Some parties may deplore it; others may wish to be delivered from modern technology and therefore from modern conflicts. Or again, they may believe that such remarkable progress in the industrial domain requires, in order to be perfect, a no less marked decline in the political order. As for us, we are not fooled by the perfidious spirit that never tires of pointing out all these contradictions to us. We know that the new forces of society demand new men who master them and make them do good work. These new men are the workers. They are, just like the machines themselves, the invention of Modern Times. In the signs that disconcert the bourgeoisie, the aristocracy and the poor harbingers of decline, we recognize our noble friend, the old mole who knows how to work so quickly underground, the worthy pioneer: the Revolution. The English workers are the first-born of modern industry. They will certainly not be the last to come to the aid of the social revolution produced by that industry, a revolution which means the emancipation of their own class throughout the earth, an emancipation as universal as the rule of capital and wage slavery.\"\n\nMan the victim of his own \"infamy\", the industrial worker the \"invention\" of modern times, the revolutionary initiative reserved for the oldest and most evolved proletariat... these are affirmations which must always be meditated upon and recalled to those disciples who have the superstition of personal incarnations and imagine that the revolutionary action of certain individuals brought to the forefront of history is identified with the revolution itself, that is to say with the proletarian revolution as understood in Marx's discourse. The actions of Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mao \u2014 names that appear or disappear according to the whims of history and those who write it \u2014 aimed only to produce, by means of state power (not without reason called \"workers'\"), enormous proletarian masses, living machines, taxable and subject to forced labor at will, which every economic system needs to pass from a primitive stage to a higher stage of capital accumulation.\n\nWith their political omnipotence, these masters of the state apparatus have succeeded in making the idea that socialism is the reign of the planning state of exploitation and of the Party as guardian of ideological purity universally triumph; they have even succeeded in having accepted as \"socialist\" the return to the methods of feudal exploitation and the medieval Inquisition .\n\nThus, we feel less stupor at the Czechoslovak \"affair\" \u2014 which is part of the normal chain of political-military gestures of Soviet imperialism \u2014 than disgust at the stupidity and ignorance displayed, on this occasion, by the specialists of \"socialist\" knowledge. Our position is very simple: if we understand that the \"socialist system\" of the USSR is an immense enterprise of oppression and mystification, and therefore the negation of all the human values \u200b\u200bthat constitute socialist ethics (from Godwin to Marx and beyond), the coup de force that has just been perpetrated is added to the already old list of crimes of the Russian power, at the top of which is the \"affair\" of Kronstadt. Once it is understood that socialism does not exist anywhere in the world today, everything becomes blindingly clear and there is no longer any need to wonder at length about the motives of Russian action in Czechoslovakia, just as there was nothing surprising in the crushing of the Budapest Commune in 1956. On the other hand, the moral defeat inflicted on Soviet imperialism by the passive resistance of an entire population will remain the great lesson of the events, whatever their outcome.\n\nToday, only one problem must be posed and discussed: that of socialism, which is still only a utopian issue, and which will remain so as long as there are states and wage earners, police forces and armies, churches and ideologies.\n\nXI.\n\nWe started from the idea that the \"objective\" meaning of the May movement will only be revealed by the outcome of the future battles of labor against capital and the State. This outcome will depend on the spirit and the will that will animate the struggle of workers and students, now united in the same total demand. Future salaried worker, the student revolted against his future condition as a slave of capital and the State, and it is through this anticipation that he immediately joined the workers' struggle. It is in the student that the spirit that deserted the union and political leaderships, accomplices of capital and the State, was embodied.\n\nThese are the symptoms that we, the partisans of council socialism, detect in the events that are taking place today in many parts of the world and which have taken on an unsuspected magnitude. It remains to define the strategy of the struggle of the new movement. It is up to the workers' councils and the student councils to elaborate their plans of struggle and the objectives to be achieved in each of the stages of the general movement. Having undertaken for several years, although with modest means, to propagate the thought of council socialism, we were less surprised to see the slogan of \"workers' councils\" appearing for the first time in France, on walls and in tracts. Not that we attribute an exaggerated importance to an influence that could only be very limited, but we consider ourselves as the heirs of a revolutionary tradition which, for having had a quasi-esoteric character for a long time, has maintained itself and strengthened itself in the shadow of the official movement. May 1968 will have helped to awaken, in action, a thought which must henceforth take root in the consciousness of all those who campaign for the realization of the New Utopia."
