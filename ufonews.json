The one exception is his new version of Too Hot To Handle, originally from the band\u2019s 1977 album Lights Out, which he played on but didn\u2019t have a hand in writing.\n\nIn an interview in the brand new issue of Classic Rock magazine, Schenker reveals that he record the song as a tribute to bassist Way and guitarist/keyboard player Raymond, who died in 2019 and 2020 respectively.\n\n\u201cThese are my songs, with the exception of Too Hot To Handle, which is in memory of Paul Raymond and Pete Way,\u201d the German-born guitarist explains, adding: \u201cI still play UFO songs live, I dedicate them to both of them. I have a picture collage here [in his home] with all the guys I have lost over the years. Paul and Pete are part of it. I see them every day.\u201d\n\nMy Years With UFO coincides with the 50th anniversary of Phenomenon, the first album the then-17-year-old Schenker recorded with UFO after joining them from the Scorpions. In the Classic Rock interview, the guitarist recalls how Way took him under his wing.\n\n\u201cPete was a great guy,\u201d says the guitarist. \u201cI never saw him angry. But he was also very shy \u2013 he covered it up with all sorts of stuff. He was an open, innocent person. When it came to his girlfriends, he was very much an underdog. I heard stories about him not even having the guts to tell his wife he was going on tour, cos she would have locked him up. I think he suffered a lot in his life, but everybody loved him.\u201d\n\nSchenker had a thornier relationship with UFO singer Phil Mogg. The guitarist insists that he quit the band after Mogg punched him in the stomach (something Mogg has always denied). In the interview, Schenker reveals that he doesn\u2019t know if his old bandmate is even aware of his new album. Even though both men live in the British seaside town of Brighton these days, their paths rarely cross.\n\n\u201cI see him once in a while at the zebra crossing,\u201d says Schenker of the singer. \u201cWhen Paul Raymond died, I saw Phil in a parking lot. I cornered him so he couldn\u2019t escape: \u2018Hey Phil, come over here!\u2019 I gave him a big hug.\u201d\n\nMy Years With UFO, which sees Schenker recruiting a host of guest vocalist, also features a high-profile appearance from Guns N\u2019 Roses singer Axl Rose on a new version of UFO\u2019s Love To Love. The collaboration came about after Schenker enlisted Axl\u2019s GN\u2019R bandmate Slash to appear on a different song, Mother Mary. Axl actually song three different UFO tracks \u2013 including Too Hot To Handle and Only You Can Rock Me \u2013 before greenlighting Love To Love.\n\n\u201cAxl is a perfectionist,\u201d says Schenker. \u201cHe puts everything under the microscope. He was not happy with his performance on Too Hot To Handle and Only You Can Rock Me, but he did such a great version of Love To Love.\n\n\u201cHe would go back into the studio and do something else: \u2018It\u2019s not right yet, it\u2019s not right yet!\u2019 We waited and waited, and eventually he got it. It\u2019s a really good song for Axl to sing.\u201d\n\nRead the full interview with Michael Schenker in the brand new issue of Classic Rock, featuring Thin Lizzy on the cover and on sale now.

It's hard to know where to start: should I start with the first? Should I choose at random? Since the default list order runs chronologically, should I play the last, because that one might represent the creative apex of fictional studio UFOSoft?\n\nIt doesn't really matter, in the end, because there's a lot. I've been absorbed by point 'n' click horror Night Manor for the past few days, but when I first booted the game I got sucked into Barbuta and Bushido Ball and neglected the other 48 games for days. I've gone through a Walforf's Journey phase too, and I've completed some levels in Camouflage and Block Koala. I've definitely not completed any of the games.\n\nNo one should feel bad or slow for not completing any UFO 50 games as yet because, during a recent chat with the Mossmouth team, I learned that no one on the team has completed all the games either. And they made it.\n\n\"No, not at all,\" Eirik Suhrke said when I asked if he (or anyone else) had finished all the games. \"It's too much. We all similarly played all of them a little bit, but yeah, I've been watching stuff on Twitch and just seeing new stuff constantly. No one has the full picture.\"\n\nUFO 50's Paul Hubans said he hasn't even played past the first level of Campanella 3, for example, despite having invested \"hundreds of hours\" testing the collection in addition to being a designer.\n\n\"You need to focus on one level (game) at a time,\" Suhrke went on. \"You've got to just black out 49 other games for a little while in order to make any progress. Whenever I thought about the whole thing I would get very dizzy and overwhelmed and I'd have to go for a walk and then just try to block out as much of it as I could. It's only now that I'm seeing the full power of the whole thing come together.\"\n\nTyriq Plummer says that the way early players are reacting to the game\u2013their surprise at its extent\u2013is close to how he himself felt when he saw how it finally came together. \"It's one of those things where even though it's such a large and broad encompassing kind of project, it still manages to feel more than the sum of its parts,\" he said. \"And that's something that was hard to get a sense of when I was working on it. But everyone else is saying now that there's way more to this than I even realized. It's super cool.\"\n\nDerek Yu agrees. \"I think that's always the best, when you're surprised by the game that you're working on, and I think that's partly why it's been so enjoyable to work on it for all these years. We're constantly sharing and surprising each other.\"\n\nAccording to our review UFO 50 is a \"a superb retro-style smorgasbord\". I spoke at length with most of the Mossmouth team earlier this week, and you can read all about that here."

        "article_content": "UFO enthusiasts are attempting to draw parallels between a old video that appears to show a flying aircraft zooming through the clouds and the recently declassified image of the UFO that was shot down near Alaska last year.\n\nThe photo shows a seemingly glowing horse shoe-shaped object with ill-defined edges over the Yukon territory in northwest Canada on February 11, 2023.\n\nAn internal email obtained by CTVNews had a Canadian brigadier-general describing it as such: 'Top quarter is metallic, remainder white. 20-foot wire hanging below with a package of some sort suspended from it.'\n\nIt was shot down by a US Air Force F-22 stealth fighter on a joint mission with the Canadian Armed Forces following the now infamous Chinese spy balloon drama that made international news that month.\n\nA former officer with the Royal Canadian Air Force told DailyMail.com that based on his conversations with three active-duty staff who were involved with the shootdown, the object was a balloon similar to the Chinese craft shot down days earlier.\n\nNonetheless, a user on Reddit said they were able to stabilize a different UFO video from over 12 years ago, claiming it is similar to the object that was shot down.\n\nThe declassified image of the UFO that was shot down in Yukon territory by US fighter jets on February 11, 2023. Canadian authorities suspect it was a balloon similar to the Chinese spy craft shot down in US airspace days earlier\n\nThis is photo of a supposed UFO that some on social media believe looks similar to the horseshoe-shaped craft shot down in Yukon territory. This photo comes from an alleged UFO sighting video that's 12 years old\n\n'I recently stabilized this footage, which has drawn interesting comparisons to the \u201chorseshoe\u201d object reportedly shot down over the Yukon in 2023,' the poster wrote. 'After stabilizing the video, the object\u2019s crescent or horseshoe shape becomes much clearer, along with its curious flight dynamics.'\n\nThey said the stabilization was done with Adobe After Effects and Premiere, software packages for editing motion graphics and video.\n\nThe video was originally posted by a YouTube channel called 'xxxdonutzxxx', which claimed the footage was shot over Busan, South Korea.\n\nThe reactions to the stabilized footage were all over the place, with some people showing their excitement and others showing skepticism.\n\n'A better way to avoid confusion would be to publish a color, high-res photo or video, as they did with that jet intercept and the Chinese spy balloon. Amazing how transparency actually works,' one user wrote.\n\nA picture taken on February 1, 2023, shows the suspected Chinese spy balloon flying over Billings, Montana\n\nThe suspected Chinese spy balloon drifts to the ocean after being shot down off the coast in Surfside Beach, South Carolina on February 4, 2023\n\nAnother took issue with the entire idea that aliens are flying around in spacecrafts that always seem to look different in every UFO video.\n\nThey wrote: 'Serious question; why does every UFO look different? Do aliens hate mass production? Have they never heard of cost reduction through standardization? What does that say about their economy? Are they idiots?'\n\nThose who are more inclined to believe aliens are out there offered a number of explanations for this. There could many many different alien races with different vehicles, some said. Others thought their space crafts could probably shape shift.\n\nElsewhere on social media, people are claiming all of the videos on the now abandoned 'xxxdonutzxxx' are fake and were made by two CG artists named Nico and Marco Kaschuba.\n\nA person posted an alleged UFO sighting in Monument Valley, Arizona, from the 'xxxdonutzxxx' channel to a UFO forum on April 5, 2012.\n\nAt the bottom of the post, there is a copyright that belongs to 'Kaschuba Ufology.'\n\nDailyMail.com approached Marco Kaschuba for comment, but he didn't immediately respond."

        "article_content": "Soon after clicking around America\u2019s new online database containing hundreds of thousands of historical UFO records, you may begin to wonder why the government has spent a lot of time and taxpayer dollars collecting data on a phenomenon that it doesn\u2019t seem to believe in.\n\nAs a casual observer taking a quick look at the database\u2014an ongoing project of the National Archives, the government\u2019s repository of historical documents\u2014you\u2019ll see many images of fake-looking flying saucers. You\u2019ll hear recordings of military personnel talking at length about various sightings, concluding that there was no credible evidence that what was observed was a UFO. You\u2019ll find a ton of grainy images and films of bright dots in the sky, as well as black-and-white 20th-century newsreel footage.\n\nBut if you dig around the somewhat clunky database, you might also discover some intriguing records. For example, a 2013 blog post mentioning a Popular Mechanics news brief that same year about an Air Force project to build a flying saucer. Surely, that would pique your interest.\n\n\u201cThe Air Force, especially, has spent a significant amount of time trying to say \u2018there is nothing here,\u2019\u201d and yet it and other government agencies have continued to investigate UAP reports, says Robert Powell, an engineer and author of UFOs: A Scientist Explains What We Know (And Don\u2019t Know).\n\n\u201cWhy would you collect all that information if you did not believe there was something to at least a portion of it? \u2026 You\u2019ll see some really interesting reports there in that data that indicate there\u2019s something to the whole UAP subject, but you have to look for it,\u201d says Powell, who is also co-founder of the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU), a nonprofit that includes scientists and researchers who apply scientific methods to the analysis of UFO sightings.\n\nLAST FEBRUARY, AT THE DIRECTION OF CONGRESS, the Archives launched the giant database, which will eventually collect records from across all federal agencies of sightings related to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), the government\u2019s term for UFOs. At present, however, it only contains some of the UAP records\u2014including photographs, moving images, and microfilm\u2014that the Archives already has on hand that have at this point been digitized.\n\nMore records are slated to be added as the agency continues the process of digitizing its own files, and more still will be added once the Air Force, NASA, and other U.S. government agencies start to digitize copies of their own records for transfer to the Archives and eventual online public disclosure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for the scientific community to have open access to information,\u201d says Powell. He points to the huge amount of data now on the hub and says it\u2019s of immense value to have it all gathered into one place and online.\n\nWhile many scientists and researchers over the years have found that the vast majority of reports of sightings are misidentifications of known objects, they agree that there remain some reports \u201cthat cannot be reasonably explained as terrestrial or astronomical objects,\u201d Powell says, adding that military and government leaders have also acknowledged this over the decades.\n\nUnlike the long-running sci-fi television classic The X-Files, in which FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder tries to expose what he believes is a massive government UFO cover-up, the endgame for the database is improving transparency for the public. At least, sort of.\n\nTo some extent, Mulder may have been right, as evidenced by ongoing calls from Washington lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle for the Executive Branch to declassify government UAP records.\n\n\u201cCongress recognizes that these records, if they exist, were likely concealed under the good faith goal of protecting national security. However, hiding that information from both Congress and the public at large is simply unacceptable,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) said in a statement last year. The senators made the statement as they introduced an initial version of a bill that was amended and eventually adopted into the law calling for the creation of a UAP collection hub.\n\nUnder law, the government may postpone public release of certain records for 25 years from the date they were first created. The president must certify that a postponement is necessary due to a risk of harming military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations, or that there is an identifiable harm so grave that it outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.\n\n\u201cThe American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence and unexplainable phenomena,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe are not only working to declassify what the government has previously learned about these phenomena but to create a pipeline for future research to be made public.\u201d\n\nBefore the UAP hub went live, the public would have had to visit one of the Archives\u2019 physical research locations to view, for example, the Air Force\u2019s files on the long-running Project Blue Book UFO investigation that ended in 1969. Now those files are just a few clicks away in the database.\n\nHow to Use the UAP Records Collection Hub The National Archives is continuing to add records of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), more commonly known as UFOs, to its online hub as it digitizes more of the records in its holdings, says Chris Naylor, executive for Research Services at the Archives.\n\n\n\nLaunched in February 2024, the hub now holds hundreds of thousands of those records, but this number will exponentially increase as more of the Archives\u2019 UAP records are digitized and as other government agencies and the presidential libraries begin the process of digitizing their own holdings and transferring them to the Archives.\n\n\n\nThe process may take some time due to the massive volume of records on file, Naylor says. Barring classified or otherwise potentially sensitive information, the goal is to create a complete catalog of all of the government\u2019s UAP records.\n\n\n\nTo find the hub, start at the National Archives homepage at www.archives.gov and click the Research Our Records tab. From there, scroll down to Research a Specific Topic , where you\u2019ll find the Foreign Affairs, Military Records & Investigations box with a link to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) . This is the hub\u2019s homepage for the Archives\u2019 massive database of UAP records.\n\n\n\nThe hub is divvied up into five broad categories of UAP-related records:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Still Picture and Photographs\n\n\u2022 Moving Images and Sound\n\n\u2022 Textural Records and Microfilm\n\n\u2022 Presidential Library, and\n\n\u2022 National Archives Blog Posts and Articles\n\n\n\nWithin each category are numbered titles of record groups (RG), the first under the Still Picture category is (RG 255) relating to NASA\u2019s records, for example. Click on the first hyperlink, \u201cFlying Saucer (photograph No. 255-GS-65-107) , and you\u2019ll be taken to the image along with links to more items in the group and series. You can also perform searches within some Record Groups and Series by using the blue search box at the top left of those pages. What you\u2019ll find as you drill down from record groups to individual items depends on what has been digitized by the date and time when you look. \u2014E.D.\n\nOver the years, the Archives has collected a significant volume of records that relate to government investigations of UAP sightings, says Chris Naylor, executive for Research Services at the Archives. Last year, it began to identify and then digitize those holdings in support of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) , a Department of Defense unit created by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2022 to work across federal agencies to investigate UAPs.\n\nThat work continues today in accordance with the NDAA of 2024 , which required the Archives to establish the collection of UAP records. Barring classified or otherwise potentially sensitive information, the Archives aims to bring together all that the government agencies\u2014as well as the presidential libraries\u2014have concerning UAPs into a central repository that can be viewed online anywhere, Naylor says.\n\n\u201cThe intent and goal of this Act is for agencies to identify specific documents or items \u2026 not necessarily a whole series [or records of a project] that may not be relevant,\u201d Naylor explains. An agency may, for example, have volumes of information on a single project that itself has nothing to do with UAPs but, nevertheless, contains one item that is relevant. That single item would be copied and digitized for the UAP hub.\n\nAgencies have an October 20 deadline to identify and prepare their records for transfer to the Archives, which will work with them on the process, Naylor says. He did not provide a timeline on when those records would begin to be uploaded to the public site.\n\nTechnology in the Sky\n\nUAP sightings have, indeed, been reported throughout history but it wasn\u2019t until the late 1940s that the U.S. government, through the Air Force, embarked on a series of dedicated UFO research projects.\n\n\u201cUAP research is often inconclusive, and our ability to explain these events seems to have become less easily resolved as our technology has advanced and our air activity has increased,\u201d says Richard Medina, lead author of a study on how local may influence the number of reports on sightings.\n\nThat may be because of a lack of funding in this area to conduct the necessary research, says Medina, a University of Utah associate professor of geography.\n\n, University of Louisville researchers Marissa Yingling and Charlton Yingling surveyed 1,460 U.S. academics about UAPs. They found that 19 percent of respondents reported that they or someone they know has witnessed UAPs and that 64 percent considered academia\u2019s involvement in UAP-related research to be very important or absolutely essential.\n\n\u201cI think we did not anticipate the interest and enthusiasm that we have received from professors around the world in a wide variety of disciplines about this topic,\u201d says Charlton Yingling, an associate professor of history.\n\nIn a , he says he found that academics more frequently reported some degree of concern for social, rather than professional, repercussions or ridicule about UAP research topics. Some were, nevertheless, also concerned about professional repercussions.\n\nLawmakers have also raised stigma concerns, as have former military personnel who shared their experiences with UAPs at a House Oversight Subcommittee hearing last year.\n\n\u201cPilots have reported encounters for years. Because of the stigma around reporting these incidents, we still do not have a complete picture of actually what is going on,\u201d Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said at the hearing. \u201cI hear over and over from many agencies the stigma around reporting and investigating UAPs prevents us from getting real answers. We know that whistleblowers have reported harassment, intimidation or stigma as well, and this is not acceptable.\u201d\n\nSome researchers echo that sentiment and say that the government\u2019s efforts to become more involved with projects like the database may help the subject matter to be taken more seriously.\n\nThe database will help somewhat in reducing the social stigma around UAPs, Powell says. \u201cI won\u2019t say that it\u2019ll go a long way [to changing opinions], but it\u2019s another step in the right direction,\u201d he says.\n\nMedina is more concerned with the long view. \u201cJust putting together a database or a collection hub isn\u2019t going to solve the problem [in that it is] not going to tell us what these things are that people are seeing,\u201d he says. More research funding is the best bet to help address that issue, he adds. And while lawmakers are helping to drive funding to this area, there\u2019s more work to be done.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more technology in the sky than ever before,\u201d he says, \u201cand we\u2019re still just as confused as we were years ago.\u201d\n\n"

The capital base in India is very strong today\u2026 if few trillion dollars of value is created [globally] because of AI, given the talent base India has, it is possible to create 10% value from India,\u201d said Mukul Arora, Co-Managing Partner at early stage venture capital firm \ufeffElevation Capital\ufeff.\n\nSpeaking at TechSparks 2024, Arora, however, cautioned that India will have to work hard to secure its share of the market.\n\nAshutosh Sharma, head of investments for India and Southeast Asia at Prosus Ventures, noted that AI can help create customised solutions for India\u2019s population.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of AI in India is we have a problem of access to quality education, health, skilling, etc. We have tried hard to figure out ways to customise the access to quality education etc through internet 1.0 and 2.0 [but the impact] is very limited without AI,\u201d said Sharma.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem and we have technology and we need someone in the middle to build [solutions],\u201d he added.\n\nThe investors also warned against jumping into a sector just because it\u2019s currently \u2018hot\u2019 or \u2018in demand.\u2019\n\n\"Because of something that has happened over the last two years in the space, I will not back off. A founder\u2019s job is to prove the unproven. Education and access to quality education is a big problem to be solved,\" said Sharma. \"The onus is on us to figure out what product fits the market; unfortunately for us, there is very little to show for it.\" Prosus is also an investor in edtech companies BYJU\u2019S and Eruditus in India.\n\nArora echoed this sentiment, emphasising that the true measure of any idea\u2019s success is achieving Product-Market Fit (PMF) and customer validation.\n\n\u201cAlways listen to your customers. If you are getting validation there, then the next question is how to scale it. Don\u2019t worry about what the VCs are thinking, if they think a sector is hot, it is already too late,\u201d cautioned Arora.\n\nWhile starting up in India has never been easier\u2014with access to capital, technological advancements, and entrepreneurs who have set a global benchmark\u2014the investors emphasised the need to focus on solving unique problems for Indian consumers with high-quality solutions."

        "article_content": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nMost parents don\u2019t get very far into their new job before they encounter a situation that has them flummoxed. It could be infant sleep issues, toddler tantrums or screen time negotiations, but, inevitably, every parent will have the thought, \u201cWhere do I go from here?\u201d\n\nSome situations demand immediate action. You pick the shrieking toddler up in the middle of the parking lot for his own safety. Other times, you have a few minutes to mull over your response, perhaps consulting with a co-parent. What, for example, are the appropriate consequences for a child refusing to do her chores? Then there are the big decisions, like when to get your child a cell phone, that you may spend months or years worrying over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet there\u2019s a widespread cultural belief that good parenting (and good mothering, in particular) is mostly a matter of instinct, that if we could just tune in to our internal wisdom, all our doubts would resolve themselves.\n\nThis makes it difficult for parents to admit when they are uncertain or may have made a mistake. It can also prevent parents from reaching out for help if they feel shame about needing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, the proliferation of parenting \u201cexperts\u201d with varying types of credentials offering books, courses and podcasts is proof that many parents are hungry for advice. When we just don\u2019t know how to proceed, we would very much like a calm, measured voice to tell us which way to turn.\n\nBecky Kennedy, aka Dr. Becky, a psychologist who has been called \u201cthe parenting whisperer\u201d for millennials and who currently has almost 3 million followers on Instagram, would likely top many parents\u2019 lists of experts they wish they could have on speed dial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKennedy, who is both warm and unflappable, advocates for what she calls \u201csturdy parenting,\u201d which conjures an image of a parent as ballast for a ship navigating choppy water.\n\nStudy parenting, she said, is \u201cthe ability to effectively embody your authority while staying connected and validating and empathizing with our kids\u2019 feelings.\u201d\n\nA sturdy parent is not an authoritarian parent who puts an end to questioning with a sharp \u201cBecause I said so!\u201d They are also not a permissive parent who empathizes with a child\u2019s feelings and subsequently complies with all of a child\u2019s demands. A study parent manages \u2014 without collapsing or losing their cool \u2014 to both acknowledge (although not necessarily validate) their child\u2019s feelings and hold to the boundary they have set.\n\nHolding boundaries when it comes to kids\u2019 behavior actually helps kids feel safe. They don\u2019t truly want parents to bend to every one of their demands, Kennedy said. \u201cThat feels very dangerous to them, because they essentially feel like they\u2019re on a plane without a pilot,\u201d she added. Kids want to know that a competent leader is in charge and that you will get them safely to where they need to go.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no official training course or credentialing body for parents. Sometimes you manage to land the plane safely through blind guessing. Other times, you crash. Either experience, understandably, sends many frightened parents looking for expert guidance. We want an experienced pilot to show us how this whole thing is done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe chatbot does not suggest that I crouch down next to my child, hanging my head in shame and muttering, 'Oh my God, this is so humiliating,' which might or might not be what an actual human mother would have done in this situation.\u201d\n\nKennedy has been reaching her followers through social media, her website, books and podcast, and she has just launched a new app using AI technology that can give parents answers to their queries in real time.\n\n\u201cI realized with AI, I can now basically show up for parents around the globe in a way that\u2019s going to feel exactly like they\u2019re texting with me or like I\u2019m sitting right next to them,\u201d Kennedy told HuffPost.\n\nKennedy is not the first parenting expert to roll out an AI tool. Economist and author Emily Oster has Dewey, a \u201cpersonal librarian\u201d who will sort through all the content on her website to find the answer to questions such as, \u201cCan I eat sushi while I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d A quick perusal of the app store surfaces other options such as AI Parenting Coach and Granny: AI Parenting Coach, which are free to download but feature in-app purchases.\n\nWhen you sign up for Kennedy\u2019s The Good Inside app, which costs $279 annually or $84 for a three-month membership, you\u2019re first led through a series of questions about what kind of help you\u2019re looking for and what challenges you\u2019re facing. You then enter your children\u2019s names (or pseudonyms) and birthdates, and the app generates a \u201cdeck\u201d that you can spend a few minutes swiping through every day in order to hone your parenting skills, sort of like a language-learning app that promises to teach you through modest amounts of daily practice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou also get access to the chatbot. To test it out, I mined the depths of my imagination for a few completely random sample behaviors from children who exist only in the hypothetical.\n\nMinus the trademark warmth in her voice, the chatbot does indeed sound believably like Dr. Becky. Much as she advises parents to do, the virtual Dr. Becky begins each of her responses by empathizing with my frustration.\n\nWhen I type in, \u201cMy toddler is sitting on the floor of the subway station. She has taken off her socks and shoes and thrown them and is saying, \u2018I not going!\u2019 How do I get her back in her stroller?\u201d the app responds with reassurance: \u201cGosh, that sounds so tough \u2014 and you\u2019re definitely not alone in facing these toddler meltdowns. Toddlers are known for their strong-willed nature, especially during transitions!\u201d\n\nThe chatbot then suggests that I acknowledge my child\u2019s feelings (\u201cI see you\u2019re really upset and don\u2019t want to go\u201d) and then try giving her a controlled choice (\u201cWould you like to put your shoes on yourself, or should I help you?\u201d) or try making a game of it (\u201cLet\u2019s pretend we\u2019re racing to get your shoes on and hop into the stroller like a kangaroo!\u201d) It concludes with a gentle reminder (\u201cRemember, it\u2019s all about staying calm and showing empathy while guiding her back to the task\u201d) and ends with a little confidence-boosting (\u201cYou\u2019re doing an amazing job navigating these tricky moments!\u201d) to hit all the notes of a classic Dr. Becky response.\n\nNotably, the chatbot does not suggest that I crouch down next to my child, hanging my head in shame and muttering, \u201cOh my God, this is so humiliating,\u201d which might or might not be what an actual human mother would have done in this situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI then tried entering the same query into ChatGPT. It delivers a brief nod of sympathy (\u201cGetting your toddler back in the stroller during a meltdown can be tricky\u201d) along with a numbered list of suggestions that aren\u2019t substantially different from the Dr. Becky chatbot: \u201c1. Stay Calm and Use Humor ... 2. Offer a Choice ... 3. Distraction.\u201d Chat GPT also suggests that I may need to use \u201cPositive Reinforcement\u201d with a line such as, \u201cOnce you\u2019re back in the stroller, we can go see/do [something fun],\u201d stopping short of using the words \u201cbribe\u201d or \u201ccookie.\u201d Its final bullet point is: \u201cPhysical Assistance: If all else fails, you may need to calmly and gently place them back in the stroller, while explaining what\u2019s happening.\u201d I am reminded to \u201cstay patient\u201d as I do this, which is not exactly what the woman crouched on the floor of the subway station wants to hear. ChatGPT is apparently unconcerned with the issue of the socks and shoes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to take any AI-generated advice with a grain of salt. The information could be too generic, culturally inappropriate, outdated or even harmful.\u201d - Brooklyn-based psychologist Nanika Coor\n\nI asked Brooklyn-based psychologist Nanika Coor if she had any experience with a client using AI for a parenting issue.\n\nShe recalled how one mother, in a state of desperation as the clock neared midnight, asked ChatGPT how to get her toddler to go to sleep. \u201cI actually thought that chatGPT gave a pretty reasonable response,\u201d Coor said. But she \u201cnoticed that the answer didn\u2019t address the nuances, like the nature of the parent-child dynamic or the parent\u2019s mental and emotional state \u2014 which I knew played a role.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne big advantage of a chatbot app is its 24/7 availability. It\u2019s there with you at any hour, in any location. Coor thinks it\u2019s probably as good as a regular search engine when it comes to run-of-the-mill issues. In Dr. Becky\u2019s app, it\u2019s also easy to find situation-specific scripts, even without using the chatbot feature.\n\nBut if your child has multiple diagnoses or you\u2019re dealing with something complex, an app may be less useful as a resource.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to take any AI-generated advice with a grain of salt. The information could be too generic, culturally inappropriate, outdated or even harmful,\u201d said Coor, adding that it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for a parent to have data privacy concerns when entering personal information into an app.\n\nSupport Free Journalism Consider supporting HuffPost starting at $2 to help us provide free, quality journalism that puts people first.

In these situations, a parent would need individual therapy to learn to recognize their unique triggers and respond in an intentional way rather than a reactive one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a few helpful suggestions and a pep talk, AI may be able to do the trick \u2014 particularly a chatbot specifically geared toward parents, like Dr. Becky\u2019s. For insight into your particular family dynamics, however, you\u2019ll have to look inside yourself."

        "article_content": "These two companies are each worth under $4 billion, but they're packed with potential.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon have become synonymous with artificial intelligence (AI). These trillion-dollar giants are among the highest-quality companies investors can buy, but smaller names can represent promising AI opportunities as well.\n\nC3.ai (AI -0.62%) was one of the world's first enterprise AI companies when it was founded in 2009, and SoundHound AI (SOUN -2.65%) has become a leader in conversational AI. The latter has even won the endorsement of Nvidia, which purchased a stake in the company late last year.\n\nC3.ai and SoundHound have market capitalizations of $3.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, but they could soar in value as the AI revolution unfolds.\n\n1. C3.ai: A unique enterprise AI company\n\nOracle chairman Larry Ellison recently said the cost to build a true, cutting-edge frontier AI model from scratch could exceed $100 billion. That's why many businesses choose to use completed models from third parties like OpenAI or Anthropic when creating AI software. However, with C3.ai, they can skip that step entirely (depending on their needs).\n\nC3.ai offers a portfolio of over 40 finished AI applications, which can be customized to suit almost any business in as little as three months from the date of the first meeting. In fact, the company has customers in 19 different industries, including financial services, manufacturing, and oil and gas, to name a few.\n\nOne of the world's largest chemical manufacturers, Dow, uses the C3.ai Reliability platform for predictive maintenance. It has achieved a 20% reduction in equipment downtime, which is such a strong result that it's rolling the software out to more of its assets.\n\nC3.ai sells its AI applications directly to customers, but it also sells them jointly with the cloud divisions of tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. It's a win-win for all parties -- the cloud providers can offer their customers more choice when it comes to AI, and C3.ai gains access to a large pool of businesses to which it can potentially sell its software. During its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended July 31), C3.ai's partner network accounted for 72% of its deal flow, making it a valuable sales channel.\n\nThe company generated a record $87.2 million in revenue during the quarter, up 21% from the year-ago period. That marked the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth as the company reaps the benefits of its shift to consumption-based pricing that was put into motion two years ago. Based on management's guidance, revenue growth could accelerate yet again in the fiscal second quarter.\n\nC3.ai stock is trading more than 85% below its all-time high, which was set during the tech frenzy in 2020. It was unquestionably overvalued back then when its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio topped 80. It has now come down to a more reasonable 9.1, below its three-year average of 10.5. That's still a premium valuation, but you can arguably justify it with the company's accelerating revenue growth.\n\n2. SoundHound AI: A leader in conversational AI\n\nLike C3.ai, SoundHound AI has also developed a portfolio of AI tools for businesses. It focuses on conversational AI applications that are capable of voice-based interactions with their users, making them highly useful in places like restaurants or inside your car.\n\nSoundHound allows restaurants to accept customer orders using AI, whether it's in-store, over the phone, or in the drive thru, with no human input required. Plus, its Employee Assist software can converse with workers about store policies or even provide instructions on how to make certain menu items.\n\nSeveral popular restaurant chains use SoundHound's products, including Chipotle Mexican Grill, Papa Johns, and Beef 'O' Brady's. The latter just rolled out AI ordering across all of its corporate locations, and it's also giving franchisees the option to use it.\n\nSoundHound's Chat AI voice assistant is popular in the automotive industry. It's already live across six brands under the Stellantis umbrella, and it's capable of providing drivers with information on a range of topics from sports scores to the status of an upcoming flight. SoundHound uses Nvidia's Drive platform to power its voice interface, which allows Chat AI to function even when there is no internet or cellular connectivity. So, not only did Nvidia buy a small stake in SoundHound, but the two companies are also closely working together.\n\nSoundHound generated $45.9 million in revenue in 2023, and management's guidance calls for the top line to grow 74% to $80 million this year. The company's outlook also anticipates growth accelerating in 2025 as revenue hits $150 million.\n\nPart of the strong forecast is attributable to SoundHound's recent acquisition of Amelia, an AI company that helps businesses create AI agents to serve their customers and employees. Amelia is expected to contribute $45 million to SoundHound's revenue next year, which is included in the above forecast. The acquisition will expand SoundHound's reach into new industries like healthcare, financial services, and insurance.\n\nSoundHound stock trades at a P/S ratio of 23.9 as of this writing, nearly triple the valuation of C3.ai stock. While that's expensive, its P/S ratio shrinks to 11.5 based on management's 2025 revenue outlook. That said, investors will need to adopt a long-term mindset as SoundHound rides the tailwinds from the ongoing advancement of AI technology."

Another legend states the creature is so horrible to behold that people jump from the trestle in fear to escape it.\n\nMore:Just Askin' | What is the Pope Lick Monster? What to know about the Louisville urban legend\n\nWhere did the Pope Lick Monster come from?\n\nVarious accounts about the beast's origin differ. Some claim that the monster was originally a circus worker who swore to take revenge after being mistreated, while others claim it's a twisted reincarnation of a farmer that sacrificed animals to gain supernatural powers.\n\nThe myth gained some notoriety when Louisville-based filmmaker Ron Schildknecht released a 16-minute film in December 1988 titled \"The Legend of the Pope Lick Monster.\" In the film, a group of teenagers go to the trestle as part of a rite of passage and one of the characters comes face-to-face with the title beast just before a train comes into view. The teen barely survives by managing to hold on to a railroad tie while the train rumbles above him.\n\nConcerns about the film influencing children to attempt to cross the 90-foot high trestle prompted Schildknecht to submit a letter to the editor to The Courier Journal in 1989, in which he stated teenagers crossing the trestle had been a common occurrence in Louisville for generations, but little had been done by parents and teachers to discourage them from avoiding the dangers.\n\n\"My interest in producing this film was to examine the reasons for such behavior and place them in the proper sociological context in hopes of dealing with the problem with a deeper understanding of the factors involved,\" he wrote. \"In depicting high school students engaged in rowdy behavior, I am saying that this is how it happens, these are the circumstances and this is what it can lead to.\"\n\nHas anyone been hurt trying to walk the train trestle?\n\nYes, in fact at least two people have been struck and killed by a train since 2016 \u2014 a 26-year-old Ohio woman and a 15-year-old from Louisville.\n\nHow can I watch the \"Out There: Crimes of the Paranormal\"\n\nHulu and Disney+ subscribers will be able to watch all eight episodes of the series starting Tuesday. The third episode is titled \"The Pope Lick Goatman.\" Other episodes feature investigations of a supposed UFO crash in Long Island and ghosts believed to haunt San Francisco's Chinatown.\n\n\"Out There\" was produced by the creative team behind the \"Sasquatch\" series, also available on Hulu.\n\nReach reporter Leo Bertucci at lbertucci@gannett.com or @leober2chee on X, formerly known as Twitter"

        "article_content": "Although penicillin was discovered on September 28, 1928 by Andrew Fleming, a British physician and professor of bacteriology at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in London, it took fourteen years for the first civilian patient to receive treatment. Such a long delay to deliver what Popular Science called one of 1943\u2019s top ten \u201ctriumphs in medicine\u201d of all time seems unconscionable. In the decades since, it has been estimated that penicillin has saved more than 500 million lives. But word of Fleming\u2019s discovery was slow to spread, the therapeutic implications weren\u2019t entirely clear, and penicillin turned out to be quite difficult to manufacture.\n\nFleming, who admittedly discovered penicillin by chance, is reported to have said, \u201cWhen I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn\u2019t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world\u2019s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I guess that was exactly what I did.\u201d\n\nHe had been conducting experiments with common staphylococcal bacteria, or staph, but left an uncovered petri dish by an open window during a vacation in Scotland. When he returned, the dish looked different. It had the usual clusters of bacterial colonies, except for one spot covered in mold. \u201cIn the broth,\u201d Fleming later wrote, \u201cthe mould grows on the surface as a white fluffy growth changing in a few days to a dark green felted mass.\u201d Around the \u201cfelted mass\u201d the broth was clear\u2014nearby bacterial colonies seemed to have been killed by mold secretions.\n\nFleming continued to experiment with what he called \u201cmold juice,\u201d eventually isolating the Penicillium fungus as the bacteria slayer. He published his findings in 1929 in the British Journal of Pathology with only passing reference to the ramifications penicillin might have to treat patients suffering from serious infections such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, gonorrhea, or meningitis. Fleming seemed more focused on its implications for helping scientists who study bacteria. \u201cIn addition to its possible use in the treatment of bacterial infections,\u201d he wrote, \u201cpenicillin is certainly useful to the bacteriologist for its power of inhibiting unwanted microbes in bacterial cultures so that penicillin insensitive bacteria can be readily isolated.\u201d\n\nA decade after Fleming published his work, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and others at Oxford University sought ways to manufacture penicillin at scale, which meant cultivating massive quantities of Penicillium. But they struggled to grow enough mold. Their production was so scant, in fact, that they ran out of penicillin while treating their first patient, Albert Alexander, in 1941. Without the medication, Alexander, who had been improving, ultimately died. It wasn\u2019t until Florey recruited help from the US Department of Agriculture and US-based pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Lilly, and Merck that mass production began in earnest.\n\nWhen, in 1943, Popular Science named penicillin as one of the top ten medicines in history, the contributing writer and physician, Iago Galdston, cited its superior infection-fighting performance when compared with the leading antibacterial treatment, sulfa drugs: \u201cPenicillin operates, as the sulfonamides do not, in the presence of pus and tissue fluids.\u201d Until then, no drugs existed that could fight \u201clong-established infections,\u201d which, as Galdston wrote, made penicillin particularly valuable. But even in 1943, penicillin was hard to come by. Galdston lamented, \u201cUnfortunately we cannot as yet produce penicillin in large quantities, and what is being produced has been preempted by the Government for military use.\u201d At the time, a single dose of penicillin cost $20 ($364 in 2024). By the time World War II ended in 1945, a dose of penicillin cost $.55 ($10 today) and was readily available in the US.\n\nLooking back, Popular Science\u2019s 1943 Top Ten List seems particularly prescient. In addition to penicillin, the new and emerging treatments that Galdston cited included vitamins and the importance of nutrition, hormone therapy to treat cancer and other disorders, and psychosomatic treatment, or the growing awareness that psychiatric disorders could manifest in physical symptoms and vice versa. Despite such medical blockbusters, it may be Galdston\u2019s final item that has had the most profound effect on medicine: \u201cBiological Thinking.\u201d Galdston defined biological thinking as an acknowledgment that \u201cthe basis of well-being lies in achieving the best possible adjustment between the individual and his physical and emotional environment.\u201d Today, we take for granted that excess stress from factors such as jobs, relationships, and finances, can make us sick, but in 1943 the idea was novel.\n\nPenicillin remains one of the most widely prescribed antibiotics. And producing penicillin still requires growing mold, but pharmaceutical companies have perfected the manufacturing process, growing Penicillium in deep fermentation tanks not unlike those used in breweries. But these tanks produce something even more valuable than beer\u2014Fleming\u2019s \u201cmold juice.\u201d\n\nPopular Science, December 1943:\n\nTen New Triumphs in Medicine\n\nMAGIC DRUGS, INGENIOUS INSTRUMENTS, WIDER KNOWLEDGE MARK THE RAPID ADVANCEMENT OF THE LAST THREE DECADES\n\nBy IAGO GALDSTON, M. D. Author of \u201cProgress in Medicine\u201d and \u201cBehind the Sulfa Drugs\u201d\n\nWithin the short span of the past 30 discoveries have developed in the field of medicine than in any comparable period during the entire history of the science. In times past, important discoveries often were followed by long periods of little or no progressive medical thinking. Today, discoveries of the utmost importance are following quickly on each other\u2019s heels.\n\nAmong these inventions and discoveries is an instrument with a moving pen, which can \u201ctake dictation\u201d from a patient\u2019s brain. The record of electrical brain waves that this amazing secretary takes down is read by the surgeon for indications of brain disorders. Another is a drug so powerful that one part in 25 million parts of water will stop the growth of bacteria. Still another has revolutionized the science of diagnosis, and has completely recast the modern physician\u2019s approach to the problem of healing.\n\nIn this writer\u2019s judgment, 10 of the greatest medical discoveries and inventions of recent years are: The sulfonamides; penicillin; the vitamins; the sex hormones; the relation of the sex hormones to cancer; the electro-encephalograph; the electron microscope; psychosomatic medicine; brief therapy; and biological thinking.\n\nThe Sulfonamides\n\nThe sulfonamides are without doubt the best known of the recent medical discoveries. And justly so, for no single group of com- pounds has proved as effective as this one in preventing and treating such a large number of diseases. Pneumonia, gonorrhea, erysipelas, childbed fever, many forms of bloodstream infection, trachoma, septic sore throat, urinary infections, meningococcus meningitis, chancroid, gas gangrene, actinomycosis, anthrax, scarlet fever, impetigo -these are but some of the conditions effectively treated with one or another of the sulfonamide compounds.\n\nEqually remarkable and numerous are the applications of the sulfonamides in the prevention of infection. Since their first use in this respect, the lives of countless men wounded in battle have been saved. The sulfonamides have also extended the scope of surgery, heretofore limited by the threat of infection supervening upon operations in contaminated regions. They are reducing the incidence of serious complications which in times past frequently followed on simple infections. There is, however, one particular aspect of the discovery of the sulfonamides which overshadows even its great practical results. The sulfonamides have given new life to the science of chemotherapy-the treatment of internal disease with chemicals. Chemotherapy got off to a great start when Paul Ehrlich discovered Salvarsan in 910 although for the next 25 years little new appeared on the chemotherapeutic scene. Then in 1935 came Prontosil, and later the sulfonamides, and the whole picture changed. But what changed most was the concept of chemotherapy itself. Paul Ehrlich and practically all of his followers thought of chemotherapy in terms of \u201cmagic bullets,\u201d that is, in terms of protoplasmic poisons which would kill germs, but not the human body. Unfortunately few such selective poisons were found. Most of the protoplasmic poisons proved as likely to injure the victim as the at- tacking germs. Then when Prontosil and the sulfonamides were found to be so amazingly effective against bacteria, the old theories of chemotherapy had to be recast, for the sulfonamides do not belong to the class of protoplasmic poisons. In fact, the sulfonamides are not even bactericidal, that is, they do not directly kill germs. They are, however, bacteriostatic: they arrest the development of germs by interfering with their metabolism. By thus weakening the germs, they make it possible for them to be overcome by the body\u2019s own defenses.\n\nToday, research follows the path of germ metabolism, and seeks to discover how that metabolism may be adversely affected by means of chemical agents. It is this new rational basis for chemotherapy that warrants our hope of finding chemicals with which to cure tuberculosis, leprosy, malaria, and other germ and virus diseases not affected by the sulfonamides.\n\nPenicillin\n\nHot on the heels of the sulfonamides came the discovery of penicillin, a chemotherapeutic agent in many respects superior to the sul- fonamides. This powerful new drug is derived from a fungus called Penicillium notatum. In 1929, this fungus, or mold, was an unwelcome in- truder into some staphylococcus cultures with which the English bacteriologist Prof. A. Fleming had been experimenting for quite some time. Fleming acutely observed then that wherever the fungus grew, the germs did not, and he reasoned that the fungus and the germs did not get along well together. He studied the matter further and found his reasoning correct.\n\nHowever, since the fungus was not antagonistic to all germs, but only to certain ones, he employed it to eliminate from groups of mixed germs those to which penicillin was antagonistic. But that was as far as the matter went at the time.\n\nWith the discovery of the sulfonamides it was natural for the scientists to turn their attention once again to the penicillium mold. Another English scientist, Prof. H. W. Florey, in 1940 extracted from the penicillium mold a brown powder-like substance. He found it to be an extraordinarily powerful drug, effective against a larger variety of infections than are the sulfonamides.\n\nThough but recently discovered, penicillin has already been subjected to numerous trials. Unlike the sulfonamides, which operate by diminishing the growth of bacteria, it has been found to kill bacteria or stop their growth entirely. But it will work in many cases where the sulfa drugs have proved useless or only partially effective. Penicillin operates, as the sulfonamides do not, in the presence of pus and tissue fluids. This renders it particularly valuable in the treatment of such conditions as osteomyelitis, empyema, infected compound fractures, and wounds and burns with long-established infections. Penicillin is superior in undermining the yellow pus-producing bacteria, the staphylococcus aureus, and many infections caused by cocci. And the user of penicillin suffers no toxic effects such as are sometimes experienced when sulfa drugs have been employed.\n\nUnfortunately we cannot as yet produce penicillin in large quantities, and what is being produced has been preempted by the Government for military use. There is, however, no reason to doubt that the chemists will before long succeed in crystallizing it and reproducing it artificially.\n\nThe Vitamins\n\nThe vitamins represent a major medical discovery of an order different from any of those thus far described. Biology and medicine have been radically affected by their discovery. Until vitamins were discovered, the conviction prevailed among medical men that there wasn\u2019t much one could do about health except to prevent disease. Doctors preached personal hygiene in terms of rest, cleanliness, exercise, fresh air, and good food. But they did so in the belief that they could only preserve health, which for any given individual was more or less fixed. For the rest, attention was focused on \u201cfighting infection\u201d by such means as vaccines, serums, antiseptics, and so forth.\n\nWith the development of the modern science of nutrition, of which the vitamins are an important segment, we learned that one could be not sick, but at the same time not healthy, as in the case of \u201csubclinical conditions,\u201d in which the patient is not manifestly ill, but also is far from well. We also discovered that susceptibility to many types of disease, including infections, was due to malnutrition, and that growth, de- velopment, and aging were profoundly influenced by the quantity and quality of the foods eaten.\n\nAs our knowledge of nutrition increases, and as that knowledge is applied to the everyday diet of people, we are bound to see a reduction in the incidence of disease, and an improvement in physical growth and wellbeing.\n\nThe Sex Hormones\n\nThe discovery of the sex hormones is one of the achievements of modern medicine on which the public is comparatively unin- formed. Yet it is truly a tremendous accomplishment.\n\nIt was a bright hunch that led to the discovery of the female sex hormone. When an ovum (egg) ripens in the ovary, it is surrounded by a minute quantity of a yellowish fluid, known as the liquor folliculi. No one thought to investigate the function of that fluid until 1922, when Edgar Allen, Ph.D., of St. Louis, and his wife obtained buckets of ovaries from a meat-packing plant and, working on their kitchen table, carefully drew off the fluid from the follicles. Soon they had enough of it to enable their coworker, Dr. E. A. Doisy, to purify it and determine its chemical constitution. This made possible the crystallization of the female hormone in 1929. In 1936 it was reproduced artificially. The discovery of the male hormone, which is credited to L. C. McGee, of Chicago, took place in 1927.\n\nThe sex hormones have proved enormously useful in the treatment of a variety of disturbances, including those of the sexual and reproductive functions. From this discovery was derived the original Aschheim-Zondek test for pregnancy.\n\nThe most important result of the discovery of sex hormones, however, is the light it has thrown upon the complicated structures and operations of the glands of internal secretion. These glands affect growth, development, metabolism, sexual function, reproduction; in fact, all phases of the \u201cinner activities\u201d of the human body.\n\nThe Relation of the Sex Hormones to Cancer\n\nCancer of the prostate is one of the most common types of malignancy affecting men. This type of cancer is difficult to discover in its early stages, and tends to spread so work of uniformly close tolerances is performed rapidly that, in actual experience, less than five percent of such cases can be successfully treated surgically.\n\nIn 1941, Dr. C. Huggins, of the University of Chicago, advanced the idea that the prostate cancer cells require the male hormone for their continued existence, even as the normal prostate cells do. He and his associates reasoned from this that castration or else the \u201cneutralization\u201d of the male hormone by means of the female hormone should adversely affect the prostate cancer growths. He, and others after him, tried the latter treatment. The results were astonishing. Although the cancer is not cured, most of the patients benefit enormously. Pain disappears, nutrition improves, appetite returns, and strength is regained. The original cancer growth in the prostate, and those that have spread to other parts of the body, regress so that many sufferers are enabled to carry on their normal activities in comfort. This treatment of prostatic cancer is vastly superior to any previously available. But the greatest value of the discovery is that it has stimulated many scientists to study the relation of the sex hormones to cancer in general.\n\nThe Electro-Encephalograph\n\nThis recent invention is a sleuthing machine for tracking down the mysterious ways of the brain. Working by means of vacuum tubes similar to those used in a radio, it picks up \u201cbrain waves\u201d-electrical impulses generated in the head by brain function. These currents, which have distinguishing characteristics, are visibly recorded by a moving pen. Since a brain suffering from some organic ailment sends out waves differing from those generated by a normal one, the record set down by the electro-encephalograph can be read by the brain surgeon for indications of such dis- orders as brain tumors and epilepsy. This useful diagnostic instrument promises to be of great value in the study of the physiology of the nervous system, and of the dynamics of drugs employed for their effects on the nervous system.\n\nThe Electron Microscope\n\nThe electron microscope likewise promises to prove a great research instrument. The ordinary microscope cannot magnify an object beyond approximately 2,000 diameters, this limitation being imposed by the wavelength of light. The electron microscope, however, can magnify objects from 50,000 to a 100,000 diameters. It can, therefore, be readily seen how this extremely powerful instrument has opened up new and vast fields of research in bacteriology and biochemistry. We are now able to obtain a really intimate insight into the structure of both living and nonliving matter, and, most interestingly, of that \u201cin-between\u201d matter known as the viruses, which are responsible for such destructive diseases as smallpox, influenza, and infantile paralysis.\n\nPsychosomatic Medicine\n\nOne of the more interesting developments of psychiatry goes by the name of psychosomatic medicine. It represents the fusion of orthodox clinical medicine with the best in psychiatric knowledge. It teaches the important lesson, in an irrefutable way, that there is no disorder of the soma (the body) without some involvement of the psyche (the mind and the emotions), and conversely, that psychiatric disorders have their somatic (physical) components. In some instances, indeed, physical symptoms are the only tangible manifestations of what is primarily a psychiatric condition. This insight into the interplay of psyche and soma has made possible a much more effective treatment of many conditions which in times past could be treated only superficially. It also enables the physician to anticipate, and by appropriate action to prevent, the development of a variety of physical and emotional strains and disorders.\n\nBrief Therapy\n\nRelated to psychiatry is the new experimental development of brief therapy. The objective of these experiments is, simply, brevity of treatment. Most of the techniques of psychiatric therapy as practiced today are lengthy and therefore costly. Far too many persons who require treatment cannot afford it. And there are not enough trained psychiatrists available to meet the needs. To correct these deficiencies, studies, conferences, and experiments are being conducted to develop techniques of psychotherapy that will be effective but less time-consuming.\n\nBiological Thinking\n\nFinally we come to that development in present-day medicine which blankets all others: the ability to think biologically. Today the physician thinks of his patient in terms of his many environmental relationships\u2013his job, his marriage, his friends, his education, his degree of success, and so forth. A short while ago, however, the physician thought of his patient only in terms of his complaints, of the symptoms or disorders he discovered and of the specific remedies he could use in the treatment of \u201cthe case.\u201d In fact, the physician was more concerned with the \u201ccase\u201d-with the disease afflicting the patient-than with the patient himself.\n\nToday, we know that to effect a permanent cure, the contributory as well as the primary factors must be considered and dealt with; that, in substance, the basis of well-being lies in achieving the best possible adjustment between the individual and his physical and emotional environment."

        "article_content": "A discovery has been made which has the ability to change everything that we know about the universe.\n\nThat's right, and it's all because of The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).\n\nIf you don't know what it is, the JWST is a more advanced version of the legendary 1990 Hubble telescope, which was launched into space in December 2021.\n\nAdvert\n\nLiving up to its expectations, the JWST has made numerous discovers in space, which could even point to there being life beyond our small planet.\n\nIt also went on to find that potential planets could be forming right before our eyes after discs and dust gathered around two stars.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has made a shocking discovery (Getty Stock Image)\n\nThe telescope has captured so many high resolution images of galaxies, as well as stars being formed and even early stage black holes (which is more scary than it is cool).\n\nAdvert\n\nBut it's JWST also made a shocking discovery, which one physicist has called a 'crisis' in the way we understand the universe.\n\nAstronomers have used the information from both the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes to confirm one of the problems in physics that still baffles them.\n\nWhat is the Hubble Tension?\n\nThe issue they need help with is that scientists have arrived at different estimates of the rate of the universe's expansion.\n\nAdvert\n\nThis is called the Hubble Tension, and could potentially upend the world of cosmology for good.\n\nHave we misunderstood the universe? (Getty Stock Image)\n\nHow do we know how fast the universe is expanding?\n\nThere are two ways to figure out the Hubble constant - a value that describes the universe's expansion rate.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe first way is basically through the Big Bang's leftovers, which are tiny fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, astronomers figured out that this figure was roughly 46,200 mph per million light years, or about 67 kilometres per second per megaparsec (km/s/sMpc).\n\nThe second way is to use pulsating stars, also known as Cepheid variables.\n\nAstronomers use the outer layers of dying stars, which flicker like broken street lights in the distance.\n\nAdvert\n\nBy measuring its brightness, these Cepheid stars can be chained into a 'cosmic distance ladder', which allows us to look further into the past of the universe.\n\nUsing this, an exact number can be pinpointed that reveals the speed of the universe's expansion.\n\nEstimates of the universe's rate of expansion contradict each other\n\nBy using the second method, Adam Riess - professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University - and his colleagues estimated that the universe's expansion rate is actually about 74 km/s/Mpc, a value much higher than the previously thought 67 km/s/Mpc.\n\nThis could make the universe 10 percent younger than we originally thought.\n\nScientists have called it a 'crisis' (Getty Stock Image)\n\nThe world of cosmology has been catapulted into uncertainty following this discovery.\n\nNobel Prize winning astronomer David Gross called it a 'crisis' at a 2019 conference.\n\nWhat did the James Webb Space Telescope find?\n\nInitially, the discovery was thought to be a measurement error by confusing Cepheid stars with regular stars in the Hubble's lens, but the much more accurate JWST disproved these claims, confirming the new discovery.\n\nOn 6 February, a study was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, highlighting that our understanding of the universe could be very, very wrong.\n\nLead study author Riess stated: \"With measurement errors negated, what remains is the real and exciting possibility we have misunderstood the universe.\"\n\nRiess observed 1,000 other Cepheid stars in five separate galaxies as far away as 130 million lightyears from Earth, further confirming their findings on the Hubble constant.\n\nHe explained: \"We've now spanned the whole range of what Hubble observed, and we can rule out a measurement error as the cause of the Hubble Tension with very high confidence.\n\n\"Combining Webb and Hubble gives us the best of both worlds. We find that the Hubble measurements remain reliable as we climb farther along the cosmic distance ladder.\""

        "article_content": "Crinkles and divots in the surface of Earth on T\u00fcrkiye's Central Anatolian Plateau are the smoking gun for a newly discovered class of plate tectonics.\n\nBeneath a depression called the Konya Basin, Earth's crust is slowly dripping deeper into the planetary interior, a process that is gradually shaping the surface geology of not just the basin, but the plateau that surrounds it.\n\nIt's called lithospheric dripping, a phenomenon that has only recently been discovered here on Earth, and geologists are still figuring out the different ways it manifests.\n\n\"Looking at the satellite data, we observed a circular feature at the Konya Basin where the crust is subsiding or the basin is deepening,\" says geophysicist Julia Andersen of the University of Toronto.\n\n\"This prompted us to look at other geophysical data beneath the surface where we saw a seismic anomaly in the upper mantle and a thickened crust, telling us there is high-density material there and indicating a likely mantle lithospheric drip.\"\n\nWe have a pretty good idea of how it works. When the lower portion of Earth's rocky crust is heated to a certain temperature, it starts to go a little gooey. Then, like honey or syrup, it slowly oozes downward \u2013 a bit like a pitch drop experiment, but much bigger and slower.\n\nAs this drop descends, it pulls the planetary crust down with it. This creates a depression, or basin. Then, when the drop detaches into the mantle, the surface rebounds, bulging upwards, with a widespread effect.\n\nWe only began to understand this process a short time ago, but modeling its evolution has already allowed Andersen and her colleagues to identify one region of the mantle where dripping has taken place, at the Arizaro Basin under the Central Andes.\n\nNow, careful analysis of surface geology and laboratory experiments has led them to another oozy drip under the Central Anatolian Plateau \u2013 and the signpost was the Konya Basin.\n\nThe Central Anatolian Plateau is known to be uplifting over time. Previous research suggests that it has gained around a kilometer (0.6 miles) in altitude over the past 10 million years thanks to the release of a crusty drip.\n\nBut then there's the Konya Basin, which is subsiding downwards at a rate of around 20 millimeters (0.8 inches) per year. That doesn't sound like much, but a sinking patch of ground in a region that is rising upwards warrants further investigation.\n\nThe team's findings suggest that the broader region of the plateau is in the throes of the rebound phase of the lithospheric drip process, after having dropped its gooey molten load into the mantle. The Konya Basin? That's a smaller, second drip forming.\n\n\"As the lithosphere thickened and dripped below the region, it formed a basin at the surface that later sprang up when the weight below broke off and sank into the deeper depths of the mantle,\" says Earth scientist Russell Pysklywec of the University of Toronto.\n\n\"We now see the process is not a one-time tectonic event and that the initial drip seems to have spawned subsequent daughter events elsewhere in the region, resulting in the curious rapid subsidence of the Konya Basin within the continuously rising plateau of T\u00fcrkiye.\"\n\nThe researchers validated this model by setting up a lab experiment. They filled a plexiglass tank with a highly viscous silicone polymer called polydimethylsiloxane as a proxy for Earth's gooey lower mantle. A mixture of polydimethylsiloxane and modeling clay was used to replicate the upper mantle, while a mixture of ceramic spheres and silica sand served as the crust.\n\nThen, they inserted a dense \"seed\" into the upper mantle layer to initiate a drip, and observed the results. Within 10 hours, the first drip had started to fall. By the time it reached the bottom of the box, after about 50 hours, a secondary drip had started to descend.\n\nNeither drip was associated with horizontal deformation of the surface \u2013 only vertical. And these deformations were consistent with the Konya Basin.\n\n\"What we noticed was that over time, this secondary drip did pull the crust downward and started to create a basin, despite no horizontal movements in the crust at the surface,\" Andersen says. \"The findings show these major tectonic events are linked, with one lithospheric drip potentially triggering a host of further activity deep in the planetary interior.\"\n\nThese results suggest that lithospheric dripping is a multi-stage process, and neatly explains the strange, simultaneous uplifting and subsidence observed on the Central Anatolian Plateau.\n\nThe research has been published in Nature Communications."

They had no idea the effort was backed by Silicon Valley billionaires who wanted to build a \u201cstartup city\u201d or that a relatively new Honduran law would allow them to establish this semiautonomous enclave. They could not foresee they would lead a fight against it that would launch their village into national politics and prompt an international legal dispute, threatening to bankrupt the country. They thought it was just another hotel.\n\nCrawfish Rock is a fishing village of a few hundred people on the island of Roat\u00e1n. It is the kind of place where children roam free, scouring the forest for iguanas or catching crabs under the Caribbean\u2019s glassy waters.\n\nIt is also the site of Pr\u00f3spera ZEDE, a libertarian experiment in market-driven governance whose backers are suing Honduras for up to $10.775 billion. Prospera\u2019s Delaware-based creator, Honduras Pr\u00f3spera Inc., argues its project has a right to continue operating even though the law that enabled it was repealed two years ago, and that it should retain that right for 50 years. To make this claim, Honduras Pr\u00f3spera cited a trade agreement Honduras signed with the United States, where the investors are based, and an unrelated treaty with Kuwait.\n\nHonduras Pr\u00f3spera\u2019s is just one of 15 similar claims against the Honduran government, nearly all of which have been filed since February 2023. Collectively, investors who brought four of the claims are seeking up to $12.3 billion, nearly twice as much as Honduras\u2019 entire public expenditures in 2022. The amount sought in the other 11 claims has not been made public. Should Honduras be ordered to pay any of those judgments, it will have no right of appeal.\n\nHow could this be?\n\nThe cases were brought under an obscure system in international law known as investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS. Written into thousands of investment treaties and trade agreements, the system allows foreign investors to bring arbitration claims against states. While it was intended to protect investors against asset seizures or corrupt court judgments, critics say corporations now use ISDS to extract huge sums when governments tighten regulations or levy new taxes.\n\nThe cases are heard by ad-hoc tribunals of arbitrators who are generally corporate lawyers. There is no precedent and no appeal. Tribunals have issued billions of dollars in awards even in cases where corporations violated domestic laws, polluted the environment or trampled on basic human rights.\n\nThe ISDS system has also emerged as a threat to climate action. Fossil fuel companies have begun suing governments that try to phase out coal, oil and gas. In the case of poor, climate-vulnerable nations like Honduras, multibillion-dollar claims can worsen a poverty trap.\n\nIn a cruel cycle, climate change has contributed to Honduras\u2019 soaring debt, according to a recent United Nations report, while more debt hampers the country\u2019s ability to spend money protecting its people from extreme weather. As a result, \u201csignificant proportions of the population have been internally displaced or displaced across international borders.\u201d"

Surfshark One includes malware protection for less than a dollar more each month. Surfshark One+ costs $2 to $3 more monthly and protects your privacy with ongoing requests to remove your personal information from data brokers.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a better VPN deal, there are usually sales and promotions that can help you save more.

Installation was quick, with helpful tips to install the apps and browser extensions.\n\nThe Windows app is well-designed, with a panel on the right showing at-a-glance confirmation of whether or not the VPN is enabled, which features are on, and which server I\u2019m connected to.\n\nOn the left, I get a list of worldwide servers with quick links to recommended, recently used, and favorites at the top of the list. I can also search for a location and filter the list to see only static IP addresses or multi-hop servers.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to use the basics without understanding advanced features, yet fine-tuning is a click away whenever you want.\n\nA toolbar on the far left lets me change settings for the VPN connection, access my account, get help, and explore features like antivirus protection and identity alerts.\n\nThe browser extension is convenient since that\u2019s where I\u2019m most likely to want to change VPN settings. However, the app has more settings.\n\nFeatures (reliability, speed, location hidden, cross-plat, special)\n\nBeyond protecting privacy, I want a VPN that is fast and reliable. To test Surfshark, I connected to several servers located around the world. The results were impressive.\n\nWith Surfshark\u2019s Windows app and browser extension, I enjoyed quick connections that never dropped and good speeds worldwide. My ISP delivers 900 Mbps download speeds over Ethernet. Most streaming VPNs cut that in half even when I select a nearby server.\n\nWith the nearest Surfshark VPN server, I measured 728 Mbpson the SpeedTest website, one of the fastest I\u2019ve ever recorded for a VPN. Upload speed was 38 Mbps and ping was around 44 ms both ways. I\u2019m in Nova Scotia, Canada, on the East Coast and the closest Surfshark server was in Montreal, over 700 miles away.\n\nGreat speed within the country is nice, but I often use a VPN to browse worldwide like I was a local, so the real challenge is maintaining good bandwidth across the border.\n\nSurfshark continued to deliver blistering speed with 667 Mbps down, 17 Mbps up, and a 75 ms ping with a U.S. server. Upload speeds and ping always drops overseas, and that was true for Surfshark, but downloads were very fast with 579 Mbps for the U.K., 651 Mbps for France, and 630 Mbps for Germany.\n\nThe first significant drop showed up with an Australian server that managed 306 Mbps downloads. The 5 Mbps uploads and 100+ ms ping of European servers fell to 2Mbps uploads and 244 ms ping Down Under.\n\nOverall, Surfshark outpaced speedy VPNs like ExpressVPN and the fast and cheap TorGuard. While Surfshark was consistently fast, the other two performed well with nearby servers, but fell behind when connecting to more distant locations.\n\nSurfshark One includes a virus scanner and real-time protection for up to five devices. Surfshark\u2019s antivirus earned a perfect score in a June 2024 evaluation by independent cybersecurity lab AV-Test.\n\nIn my spot-check of Surfshark One\u2019s CleanWeb feature, it didn\u2019t block any of Wicar\u2019s malware tests. That\u2019s because Surfshark\u2019s blocking is reputation-based. That means it won\u2019t block and alert you to dangerous websites or downloads unless they are in its database.\n\nAfter downloading the EICAR malware test file, I ran Surfshark One\u2019s antivirus scanner and it quickly identified and quarantined the threat. Although Wicar.org is safe, more advanced antivirus software detects browser exploits and malicious files, preventing the potential threat before it\u2019s downloaded to your computer.\n\nSupport\n\nSome VPN providers have good, but slow support since answers come via email. Surfshark has 24/7 live chat support so you can get help all day, every day.\n\nI tested it by asking about CleanWeb, Surfshark One\u2019s blocking feature. An AI chatbot was helpful, offering several buttons to narrow down my questions and pointing me to relevant support documents.\n\nWhen I stumped the bot, I asked for a human and was immediately transferred. I learned that the Surfshark browser extension is for convenience, but you get the same VPN and antivirus protection from the app.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nSurfshark makes its privacy policy easy to understand by getting to the most important details first: minimal data is collected, only what\u2019s needed to provide the service you\u2019re paying for. Surfshark requires your user ID or IP address and time stamp while browsing, but deletes that data within 15 minutes of your session ending.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any record of Surfshark security breaches, and the privacy policy checks out. While Surfshark is located in a Nine Eyes country, it\u2019s audited no-log policy indicates the company won\u2019t have any data to share even if there are official requests.\n\nSurfshark doesn\u2019t sell or share your email to third-party advertisers.\n\nIs Surfshark right for you?\n\nSurfshark has a well-designed app, great customer service, and one of the fastest streaming VPNs with plenty of servers around the globe. The unlimited device support makes it hard to go wrong with this service, particularly if you subscribe for one to two years.\n\nFor less than a dollar extra each month, Surfshark One includes a good malware scanner and dark web monitoring. That\u2019s a tempting offer, but it offers limited browser protection. You\u2019ll want to keep your dedicated antivirus software active to block viruses. Surfshark Starter is the best pick for most people.\n\nI was impressed with Surfshark\u2019s speed, reliability, and depth of features. The quick support makes it easy to get help or learn more about how to use Surfshark\u2019s apps and extensions.\n\nI recommend Surfshark as one of the best VPNs with excellent speed, good privacy protection, easy operation, and great value."

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nCAMPBELL, Calif., September 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ChargePoint (NYSE: CHPT), a leading provider of networked charging solutions for electric vehicles (EVs), announced today the trends it believes will propel EV charging growth. ChargePoint is working across all market segments and all classifications of electric vehicles to remain the leader in charging innovation, developing products now for this future ecosystem.\n\n\"The charging industry routinely discusses the \u2018now,\u2019 without saying much about the future,\" said Rick Wilmer, CEO of ChargePoint. \"ChargePoint remains focused on the opportunities ahead of us. Innovations that previously seemed futuristic are about to materialize, so we are excited to relay the trends and technologies that we believe will disrupt EV charging as we know it.\"\n\nCharging developments are soon coming to market via next generation products and features. The biggest technological leaps lie within the innovative software behind charging, which in turn will revolutionize the hardware it manages. Conversely, the chargers and the vehicles themselves are developing for V2X (vehicle to everything) capabilities. We expect these advancements will reshape the economics of home, fleet and municipal charging \u2013 often while balancing the electrical grid. Automotive manufacturers have realized they must fully embrace charging to sell more vehicles and deliver their desired customer experience. EVs are now a normal sight, and the new generation of vehicles is arriving with standard features that overcome barriers to EV adoption, such as an EPA-estimated range of more than 300 miles, and 800-volt platform architecture to enable faster charging.\n\nFor EV drivers, there are a variety of conveniences in the making. Most importantly, chargers that \"just work\" are here. The days of dealing with interoperability issues, aborted charging attempts, and other common frustrations are fading, paving the way for a smoother EV experience. Car manufacturers and the charging industry have collaborated to eliminate these growing pains from their next generation vehicles and chargers. \"Plug and Charge\" is finally rolling out: the concept of driving up to a charger, plugging it in, charging, and driving away upon completion. No authentication steps, no extra devices to start a charge, and automated payments in the background. ChargePoint is leading the industry by developing compatibility software and hardware. These products, which are rolling out now, enable seamless functionality between cars and major charging networks that were previously not open to one another, or did not have the right connector type for one another.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoftware has become the key component in any EV charging solution, capable of unlocking the greatest benefits. Examples include real-time charger visibility for networks, the deployment of AI to facilitate charger reliability, and power sharing to maximize charging efficiency. This highlights the immense value software brings to the table, beyond just networking chargers. Much like \"software defined vehicles,\" the ecosystem which fuels them is rapidly becoming one of \"software defined charging,\" where success is reached in the cloud \u2013 not on the ground.\n\nIn the realm of hardware, visions are finally becoming a reality. The cost of a charger is gradually declining, while we expect features and benefits which enable a connected, electrified society will soon be rolling out. For vehicle charging at home, AC will remain the norm, but offer more functionality. When vehicle to home charging (V2H) is desired, a switch to DC current will be the answer. DC will better enable V2H capabilities, such as solar integration and using your car as a backup home electricity solution. Advancements in AC charging technology have approached its limits, so for public and commercial charging the future will focus on affordability, prompting more installations. We expect DC fast charger offerings to standardize around three speed ranges, based on the types of businesses which offer charging, and typical grid power available at their facilities. For example, a convenience store might offer charging at 50 kW, a grocery store can offer 200 kW, and a dedicated travel center can accommodate 400 kW fast charging. Charging providers will benefit from more affordable DC charging solutions, which will combine with vehicle to grid (V2X) capabilities to serve as a critical grid resource.\n\nFor auto manufacturers, the charging experience is no longer an afterthought, and they have invested heavily in second generation vehicles. These vehicles address previous barriers to entry while offering the features EV drivers aspire to have. Still in its infancy, we believe bidirectional energy capabilities will quickly become the norm. Advances in EV battery technology will bring down cost and weight, while increasing the charging speeds these batteries are capable of. We expect that charging speeds will cap at 600-700 kW for vehicles on 800V architectures, as there is no practical use case for charging faster.\n\nIn conclusion, charging companies and EV manufacturers have been working hard to address the challenges associated with first generation technology, and many of those improvements are available now. Next, the industry can move from a focus on core functionalities to affordability, reliability and aspirational features. ChargePoint is at the forefront of this evolution and will release new products and features to drive the future of charging in real time.\n\nChargePoint and the ChargePoint logo are trademarks of ChargePoint, Inc. in the United States and in jurisdictions throughout the world.
