            "article_content": "\n\n\n\nThe US Congress has been attempting to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs - as our maps show the places in the UK and America most likely to be visited by extra-terrestrials.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023. That was a 20% drop from 497 UFO sightings in 2022 and also lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484).\n\nIt found that people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39).\n\nREAD MORE: Gorgeous Somerset cafe which perfects cake for the kids and coffee for the parents\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: The Saturday night when 85 cows thundered through a Somerset town\n\nYou can see what UFO encounters have been reported where you live using our interactive map.\n\n\n\n\n\nSightings documented in the UK included:\n\n\n\nA \u201clong cigar-shaped craft with three or four roundish patterns on it\u201d was observed for 20 minutes before it \u201cvanished like a light being switched off\u201d above Chester in Cheshire in October last year.\n\nA \u201crocket-type object\u201d was spotted flying above the clouds over Hartlepool \u201cextremely fast and soundless with flames over the front\u201d in November 2022.\n\nA 30ft to 40ft wide \u201cround saucer-like object with detailed outer rim\u201d was seen \u201chovering over a house\u201d in Bedworth, Warwickshire, in January.\n\nSome Somerset sightings include two round discs, a dull red colour, following the flight path of an aircraft with no sound unlike the aircraft over Shepton Mallet, a moving light disappeared at Orion. Followed by multiple other lights all in the same place moving West to East over Glastonbury, and a tic-tac like shape moving very slowly in the sky above Spaxton.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings (48%) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25%) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17%), \u201csphere\u201d, (10%) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (9%).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34). When it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts. Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold - former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team - told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d. However, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US submarines and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government - or any other government - are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d He insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by Chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies. While the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be."

The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nUsers local to the New York City area confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nOther users deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious, and was shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump carries a pair of his new signature shoes before taking the stage at Sneaker Con at the Philadelphia Convention Center on February 17, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nCampaign catchphrases aside, we can probably all agree that this was a very weird year in politics, particularly in Pennsylvania, the swingiest of swing states. Before we look ahead to 2025 let\u2019s review the ways Pennsylvania\u2019s politics and politicians got a little (or a lot) weird in 2024.\n\nAs unlikely as it may seem, President-elect Donald Trump did, in fact, take the stage at Sneaker Con in Philly back in February to unveil an official sneaker: gold high-tops with American flag logos, available for pre-order at $399 (limit three pairs per customer). Reporter John Cole had to convince his editor it wasn\u2019t a social media joke, and ended up with a front row seat despite little advance notice from the campaign about where and how to catch Trump\u2019s appearance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump admitted the sneakerhead crowd was \u201ca slightly different audience than I\u2019m used to,\u201d but also said launching the shoe line was something he had wanted to do for \u201ca long time.\u201d He did not wear the shoes on stage. And further proving that politics make strange bedfellows, we discovered that according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the president of Sneaker Con made donations to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and a Trump-affiliated PAC, although in relatively small amounts.\n\nDuring a budget hearing in February, the head of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) talked about the agency tracking UFO sightings, to the surprise of committee chairperson Jordan Harris. It took a while to receive them, but senior reporter Peter Hall sought records on the sightings, which showed PEMA investigated more than a dozen incidents over the past decade.\n\nThe sightings included mysterious lights following a motorist on a dark country road, a saucer-shaped craft hovering over a suburban subdivision, and a flaming orb falling into the woods, the records show. Many of the incidents are reported to Stan Gordon, a Westmoreland County resident who operates a 24-hour UFO, bigfoot and cryptid reporting hotline, who said the line has \u201cnever stopped ringing\u201d since the Kecksburg UFO incident of 1965.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always taken these cases very open mindedly,\u201d Gordon told the Capital-Star \u201cWe approach them scientifically.\u201d\n\nMold in a government office does not seem like the kind of situation that would require a whistleblower, but here we are. A staffer at Rep. Eric Davanzo\u2019s (R-Westmoreland) district office in West Newton complained of foul odors, and bought tests to check for the presence of mold. That didn\u2019t go over too well when the tests came back positive, and she was later fired. She sued for wrongful termination and the Commonwealth Court ruled she could move forward with a whistleblower lawsuit.\n\nFirst things first: If you want to try to modify the weather in Pennsylvania, you need a license \u2014 but since the law took effect in 1967 no one has applied for one (we asked).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin), former GOP nominee for governor, claims that new technology and a proliferation of weather modification patents \u201cowned by a combination of Federal Government Agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations, and large multinational corporations\u201d have brought forward the need to update Pennsylvania\u2019s law. He wrote a memo seeking co-sponsor for legislation he intends to introduce.\n\nThe legislation would ban the release of substances within the borders of Pennsylvania to affect the temperature, weather or intensity of sunlight, and appears to be rooted in the false belief that condensation trails left by high flying aircraft are actually trails of chemicals \u2014 aka chemtrails \u2014 released by the government for nefarious reasons, that has become conflated with techniques being explored to reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the atmosphere.\n\nIt\u2019s not often you get the opportunity to write a story with so much potential to use the phrase \u201cred wave.\u201d Alas, it only occurred to our headline writer much later (which, truly, is probably for the best). In June, Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton) objected to a bill to create a grant program that would make pads and tampons free for public school students. She didn\u2019t like that the bill\u2019s cosponsorship memo referred to menstruating women as \u201cpeople,\u201d and claimed the bill was \u201cjust another step by the governor and Democrats to have government provide everything for you, which leads to communism.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s prime sponsors, Rep. Darisha Parker (D-Philadelphia), said the bill would serve to \u201crestore the dignity to these women and girls who have gone unsupported far too long.\u201d\n\nThe bill passed the House by a vote of 117 to 85. It did not advance in the Senate."

            "article_content": "AI is now everywhere, even if it is not natively integrated. It has given everyone the power to get things done, understand complex things, and create images using their imagination. Meta AI, the AI-powered chatbot, has been rolled out to almost everyone, and here is how to use the Meta AI in WhatsApp, Instagram, or Facebook.\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of all these apps before you try. Also, it is possible that Meta may not have rolled it out for all users and countries. So, if you press @ and Meta AI doesn\u2019t show up, that would be why.\n\nHow to use Meta AI in WhatsApp\n\nMeta AI was the first to roll on WhatsApp and has been incredibly useful for many. If you are a small business or struggle with creative writing, Meta AI can help you rather quickly. You can access Meta AI using the @ button in single or group chat and interact with it directly as a contact.\n\nSince the group chats are visible to everyone, use the one-to-one chat to get things done and then forward it to other groups or chats.\n\nYou can also access Meta AI using the individual chat option. The interesting part is that Meta AI now offers an AI studio with many ChatBots of different styles. That includes advice and connections, pop culture, Anime, and more.\n\nRead: Stop Meta from using your data for AI training\n\nHow to use Meta AI in Instagram\n\nInstagram is all about Reels and Images. That\u2019s where the Meta AI imagine feature comes into the picture. While it is not natively integrated yet, you can use it in Group or Individual conversations by asking it to generate images using the /imagine switch.\n\nHow to use Meta AI in Facebook Messenger\n\nLike above, you can quickly access Meta AI using the @ button from the text box. You can then ask a question; for example, you can ask for restaurant recommendations, information on a topic, or even a request. Or you can go ahead and tag a conversation and ask Meta to explain it.\n\nIf images are your thing, then directly type /imagine or @metaAI /imagine followed by your description, and it will generate AI images you can send. However, do remember that Meta AI will provide answers or content directly within your chat, visible to all participants.\n\nRead: Is it Real or AI Picture? How to identify using tools?\n\nMeta AI in WhatsApp is not working\n\nIf Meta AI isn\u2019t working correctly in WhatsApp, make sure your app is up to date, as older versions might not support the feature. If issues persist, clear the app\u2019s cache through your phone\u2019s settings to resolve minor glitches. Restart the app by closing and reopening it to refresh the connection.\n\nMeta AI is not able to read chat in the Group\n\nEven though Meta Ai is part of WhatsApp groups or Messenger, it can read or analyze a message even if tagged. If you want it to read, you must type it, and it will be visible to everyone."

            "article_content": "Ark Investment Management operates several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on innovative technology stocks. Its founder, Cathie Wood, believes software companies are the next big opportunity in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, predicting they could generate up to $8 in revenue for every $1 they spend on chips from suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nWood has invested in AI start-ups like xAI, OpenAI, and Anthropic through the Ark Venture Fund since making that prediction last year, so she's backing up her words with decisive action. Moreover, Ark's various ETFs own several leading AI software stocks like Amazon and Tesla.\n\nIf Wood proves to be right about AI software companies, here's why C3.ai (AI -4.26%) and Microsoft (MSFT -1.73%) might be two of the biggest winners in the coming years.\n\n1. The case for C3.ai\n\nC3.ai was the world's first enterprise AI company when it was founded in 2009. Now, it offers over 100 ready-made AI applications for businesses, which can help them accelerate their adoption of this revolutionary technology. C3.ai's software is especially popular in industries that aren't normally known for developing cutting-edge technology, like energy, manufacturing, and financial services.\n\nDow, which is one of the world's largest manufacturers of chemicals, uses the C3.ai Reliability application to monitor equipment and conduct predictive maintenance. It has reduced downtime by 20% so far, which translates to fewer costs and more revenue. Similarly, one multinational bank deployed the C3.ai Anti-Money Laundering application to detect fraud, and it resulted in a 200% increase in the number of correctly identified suspicious transactions.\n\nC3.ai sells its applications directly to customers, but it also has joint sales agreements with the three major cloud giants, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. C3.ai integrates with those platforms and leverages their computing power to give customers the performance they need. Since most businesses already use one of those three cloud providers, it's extremely easy for them to adopt C3.ai's applications.\n\nDuring C3.ai's fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended Oct. 31), 62% of its deals were closed through its partnership network, so it's a critical sales channel for the company.\n\nC3.ai generated a record $94.3 million in revenue during the quarter. That was a 29% increase from the year-ago period, and it marked the seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The company is reaping the benefits of a change to its business model from two years ago, when it switched from subscription-based revenue to consumption-based revenue. It streamlined the onboarding process by eliminating lengthy negotiating processes, so customers can sign up faster than ever.\n\nDeveloping AI is expensive, and it requires specialized expertise that many companies don't have. Therefore, as AI adoption spreads, more enterprises will turn to providers of ready-made solutions like C3.ai. That's why this could be a great AI stock for investors to own for the long term.\n\n2. The case for Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has a rich history of innovation that led to the creation of a broad portfolio of software products like the Windows operating system, Azure cloud platform, and 365 productivity applications (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint). The company is also a leader in AI software, thanks to its near-$14 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nThe partnership -- which dates back to 2019 -- paved the way for Microsoft to launch the Copilot AI assistant, which is now embedded into most of its flagship software apps. Copilot for 365, for example, can help users rapidly create text and image content in Word and PowerPoint, which can significantly boost their productivity. It can also answer complex questions, which is very useful when conducting research.\n\nOrganizations around the world pay for more than 400 million 365 licenses for their employees, and each of them is a candidate to add Copilot for an additional monthly subscription fee. Microsoft says 70% of the Fortune 500 companies are using Copilot for 365 already, and the number of people who use it daily more than doubled in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30).\n\nMicrosoft also created Azure AI for its cloud customers. It allows businesses to access state-of-the-art computing infrastructure to develop AI software, and it also provides them with access to industry-leading large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI's latest o1 series. Microsoft says demand is outstripping supply for its AI data center infrastructure, but the company spent around $20 billion to build more capacity during Q1. That spending is likely to ramp up in the coming quarters.\n\nValuation might be one drawback to buying Microsoft stock right now. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.2, which is a 10% premium to its 10-year average of 32.8. However, as represented by the orange line in the below chart, its forward P/E ratio (based on the consensus earnings estimate from Wall Street for the next year) is 29.2:\n\nIn other words, even though Microsoft stock is technically expensive today, it might actually be cheap for investors who are willing to hold it for at least the next year.\n\nIf Cathie Wood is right and AI software generates $8 in revenue for every $1 companies spend on chips, the potential payoff from Microsoft's data center infrastructure investments could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars in the future. As a result, it's hard to look past Microsoft stock as one of the top AI software plays."

But head honcho Sam Lake says it's too early to even think about how it's all going to end.\n\nRemedy games always had easter eggs and mysterious references to other stories in the studio's gameography, but the connection was made 'canon' in Control's AWE DLC, which either stands for Alan Wake Expansion or Altered World Event depending on who you ask. Last year's excellent Alan Wake 2 then fleshed out that interlocked story further, and even unofficially (for probably legal reasons) tied it to back Max Payne and Quantum Break - both of which are owned by Rockstar Games and Xbox respectively.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when asked about if there's an endgame in sight - an Avengers Endgame type of conclusion, if you will - Sam Lake told IGN that the studio are \"just getting started\" and \"it's too early to start talking about an endgame.\"\n\n\"I love tying these things together,\" he said. \"I love making it deeper and expanding on the lore. It really feels like this kind of opportunity to take these strands that we have put there, expand, entertain different ideas. It feels really exciting. And the way we are looking at it is, every game needs to be enjoyable on its own and stand on its own feet, but then, for our fans, for people who have been playing other Remedy games, we want to put in a lot of content for them to discover for the ongoing universe story.\"\n\nLake also explains that newcomers can jump into any of their games, and then hopefully dip back into the other, older Remedy games to \"dive deeper into that rabbit hole.\"\n\nFor now, Remedy will continue tugging at these threads in its first ever co-op shooter FBC: Firebreak coming next year, paranormal sequel Control 2, and maybe even with its Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes in collaboration with Rockstar Games.\n\nCheck out more upcoming games of 2025 and beyond to not miss a single beat."

            "article_content": "A witch who lives in a cemetery with human corpses has revealed how she leads a paranormal, supernatural lifestyle.\n\nWren Harris is a qualified Clinical Aromatherapist, Massage Therapist and Reiki Practitioner, and she\u2019s been a witch for 26 years. The 41-year-old, who\u2019s from Leicestershire, explains how she\u2019s always felt more at home in \u2018supernatural settings\u2019, which is why she lives in a three-bedroom house in a cemetery.\n\nWren shares her home with husband Justin, 50, and their children, and explains that she never turns away any visitor who is in need of help to locate the grave of a loved one buried near her home. To share her experiences with the supernatural, Wren runs an Instagram account under the name of \u2018@the_cemetety_witch\u2019 and has over 36,000 followers.\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\n\"When we first moved in I felt the presence of a man in our bedroom near the fireplace and moving towards the window, almost like a piece of video playing out,\" Wren said. \"He was not aware of me and seemed to be going about his business. I have also felt a presence near my bed on several occasions, like someone was standing there.\n\n\"We also had some activity in the lounge when we first moved in, some loud noises and bangs that had no source. All the activity seemed to stop once we settled. Recently our youngest daughter has experienced something. She couldn't put it into words but refused to sleep in the bedroom for about six months. Otherwise, our house has a sense of deep peace and things have largely settled now that we have been here a while.\n\n\"I was drawn to the space next to our house and initially thought it might be a small area for us to use, but it turns out that it's where babies are buried. Often they were buried without headstones in Victorian England because they were expensive and deaths amongst children were extremely common. I've had several miscarriages myself and feel protective over this part of the cemetery and wonder if that's why I was drawn to it.\"\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\nAlthough this would be alarming to most, Wren refuses to allow trolls who spread \"fear and hatred\" to affect her and is instead focused on making witchcraft accessible and challenging dangerous and outdated beliefs. \"There are always those people who go out of their way to locate Witchcraft accounts and leave negative comments. Usually these people have closed, private accounts and don't leave themselves open in the way that I do,\u201d said Wren.\n\n\"Sadly, most of these people are ardent Christians who have a warped view of Witchcraft. Under a picture of a late friend who was prominent in the Druid community, someone on Instagram left the comment that he was, 'now burning in hell.' The irony was not lost on me that this person who was claiming that their way is the only way and that they are morally superior, was the person spreading fear and hatred. They left a number of aggressive comments across my account denouncing me as all kinds of evil. But I don't let these comments get to me.\"\n\nWren's journey with witchcraft began when she found a book on the occult when she was only twelve years old. She says that she immediately felt a sense of familiarity like she had returned \"home\". It has also allowed her to \"love and accept\" herself and \"strive to do better\" and her parents were supportive of her newfound practice.\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) Image: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\nShe explained: \"When I was about 12, I found a book in my parents' loft called Cult and Occult by Francis King. It had been put aside to sell at a car boot sale. It covered topics such as sacred geometry, palmistry and dowsing. There was a section on British Witchcraft and I was mesmerised by the photographs; there was something about them that seemed incredibly familiar as if I'd gone 'home'. Not long after this experience, I went on a trip to Avebury Stone Circle and West Kennet Long Barrow with my school, leaving me enchanted further.\n\n\"Between these two experiences a whole new world had opened up to me. At about age 14 or 15 my mum paid for a subscription to a magazine called \"Mind, Body & Spirit\u201d. It was a ring binder collection where you received a new candle or crystal or tarot card each week, and that opened my eyes further.\n\n\"As soon as I turned 18 I joined the Pagan Federation and the Children of Artemis - two organisations which helped me step onto my path properly and led me to start meeting other like-minded folk. In recent years I have written for Witchcraft magazines and websites, reviewing books in Witchcraft, and been involved in the Pagan community both online and in person.\"\n\nWren tries to incorporate Witchcraft into her daily routine. She explains: \"Our house is extremely cold so I currently start the day with a cup of something hot, stirring in good vibes and setting my intentions for the day. I usually light some incense and a candle and set about the tasks of the day. Often we'll get a knock on the door for cemetery business, delivery men trying to find our address or people trying to locate graves. When my husband comes home we have a cup of tea together and make dinner, which again involves a bit of magic in its preparation. Many of my daily rituals and tasks involve some form of Witchcraft. Each waking moment is a chance for intention setting and opportunity. Each waking moment is a chance for joy and celebration.\"\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\nShe says that it gives her life more meaning and allows her to be completely authentic. \"Witchcraft is a lifestyle for me,\" Wren said. \"It is my beliefs, my attitudes, my practices. It is an opportunity for me to stand in my authentic self. It is an opportunity to embrace the turn of the Wheel and celebrate the deep meaning of the seasons as we navigate our way through the year, deepening our connection to nature.\n\n\"These celebrations add context and meaning to life and the passing of time. This path has helped me love and accept myself as an individual, made me strive to do better, and truly embrace the important things in life.\"\n\nWren is also extremely passionate about helping other Witches on their spiritual journeys and challenging negative perceptions of Witchcraft.\"I'm passionate about Witchcraft and would love to team this with the enthusiasm of others starting out on their path,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd really like to help and inspire new witches by sharing what I've learned by releasing my own personal Grimoire and mentoring in some way. I feel I have stepped into the Crone aspect of my life and Witchcraft journey, and it is now time to widen the circle by sharing my experience and knowledge.\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\n\"I am passionate about educating others on the topic of Witchcraft, making it accessible and dispelling myths. And I feel sorry for people who are driven to spend their time judging others. I truly wish the best for them and hope they can find a kinder way in their treatment of others moving forward. I think that we are very lucky in the UK in that we are more likely to be laughed at for calling ourselves witches, rather than being persecuted, which is absolutely brilliant, but I do think there is some element of not being taken seriously.\"\n\nWren also offered some advice for those who are interested in Witchcraft or leading a more spiritual life. \"What drives many Pagans is a deep love for nature and the desire for self-development,\" she said. \"We're also a very friendly bunch that love a good celebration. Buy some books on the subject, maybe approach some experienced witches for advice, and get reading and practising. Embrace who you are and don't compare you or your journey to others. The truth is that the learning on this path never stops - that's the beauty of it.\n\n\"The word \"witch\" is just a label that doesn't need to be adopted if it doesn't feel right. Some people lead magical lives without even realising it. That there are magical acts embedded in our everyday lives such as blowing out candles on a birthday cake and making a wish, drawing images in the air with a sparkler, or lighting a candle in church with loving intention.\n\n\"We all celebrate similar things, for example, the celebration of light in winter, which is celebrated by festivals spanning various religions. That those who follow this path are just like you and me.\""

The psychic warned that cyber threats are among the \u201cbiggest threats to global security\u201d and expressed concern about the growing dangers posed by technology and cyber warfare.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a war of men, but of machines. What comes next?\u201d Salom\u00e9 questioned.\n\nHe referred to the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict, where drone strikes and supersonic missiles are being used to devastate both countries and claim tens of thousands of lives. He also cited Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\u2019s statement that Russia is prepared to defend itself \u201cby any measure,\u201d suggesting that the use of advanced technology in the war is escalating tensions and could intensify the conflict.\n\nIn addition, Salom\u00e9 predicted that the cold war between the United States and China is increasingly becoming a \u201cposing threat.\u201d He noted the growing concerns over cyber espionage, with both countries accusing each other of cyberattacks. Salom\u00e9 warned that this could lead to a \u201cdevastating imminent hacker attack\u201d capable of paralyzing defense systems and critical infrastructure, potentially resulting in a \u201ccoordinated global failure.\u201d\n\nSalom\u00e9 also speculated that the South China Sea could become the site of a \u201ccritical event.\u201d He suggested that a group with the capability to execute a synchronized operation against space and sea communication systems might destabilize the military systems of the world\u2019s superpowers, causing chaos and disarray."

            "article_content": "OpenAI says this move will make it easier to attract investors who need a simpler setup to invest large amounts of money. Illustration: Tech & Startup Desk\n\nOpenAI, the company behind the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, announced on Friday that it plans to restructure as a public benefit corporation (PBC) - shifting to a for-profit company from its previous non-profit structure.\n\nAccording to the company, this change is aimed at helping the company raise more money to fund its efforts in developing advanced AI systems, including artificial general intelligence (AGI)\u2014AI that could potentially surpass human intelligence.\n\nHow will this new structure work?\n\nThe new structure will turn OpenAI's for-profit branch into a PBC based in Delaware. This type of company is required to balance making money with benefiting society. OpenAI says this move will make it easier to attract investors who need a simpler setup to invest large amounts of money, as per a recent report by Reuters on the matter.\n\nCompetition in the AI field is growing quickly, with companies spending billions of dollars to advance technology, suggests the Reuters report. OpenAI's last funding round in October raised $6.6 billion, valuing the company at $157 billion. However, the funding came with conditions\u2014OpenAI had to promise to remove profit limits for investors within two years.\n\nWhy this change?\n\nIn a blog post, OpenAI explained the need for the change, saying: \"The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission.\"\n\nEven with the restructuring, OpenAI's nonprofit branch will still play an important role. It will own a large share of the new PBC, based on evaluations by financial experts, making it one of the best-funded nonprofits ever, says the company.\n\nConcerns regarding this change\n\nOpenAI's decision for a for-profit shift has sparked criticism and legal challenges. Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI who left the company, has filed a lawsuit, claiming the move prioritises profits over public benefit and breaks earlier agreements. OpenAI has asked a federal court to dismiss the lawsuit, saying Musk originally supported the idea of for-profit changes.\n\nMeta Platforms has also raised concerns, reportedly asking California's attorney general to block the restructuring. Critics argue that while PBCs are meant to balance public good and profits, there's no strong enforcement to ensure companies stick to their missions, adds the Reuters report.\n\nOpenAI's decision reflects the growing pressure to keep up in the fast-moving and costly world of AI development. Whether the new structure can truly balance profits and public good remains to be seen."

            "article_content": "ChatGPT developer OpenAI has announced details of its departure from the non-profit model. In the new constellation, there will still be a non-profit arm in the corporate structure, but it will play a completely different role. The remaining parts of the organization will be transformed into a so-called Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). The principle of non-profit status will not be completely lost.\n\nAnzeige\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI provided information about the planned developments in a blog post. In the past, OpenAI already had a for-profit wing, which was, however, subordinate to a non-profit umbrella organization to which a large part of the profits went. The company now wants to convert this wing into a PBC in accordance with the requirements of the US state of Delaware.\n\nOpenAI adopts new legal form\n\nCompanies with this legal form act both for profit and for the common good. In contrast to traditional, purely profit-oriented legal forms, a PBC takes into account the financial interests of stakeholders and the interests of those who are affected by a company's activities. The promotion of the intended charitable goal also plays a role. The textile company Patagonia or the ice cream producer Ben & Jerry's also have such a legal form.\n\nIn future, the PBC division of OpenAI will manage the business of OpenAI, which was previously the responsibility of the non-profit umbrella organization. However, the non-profit division will continue to exist and will in future \"pursue charitable initiatives in areas such as healthcare, education and science\" under its own management, according to the blog post.\n\nFor-profit course has already led to court\n\nOpenAI announced the move from non-profit to for-profit in October, after this was a condition of a funding round with Microsoft and Nvidia, among others, as backers. One of the OpenAI co-founders is not at all enthusiastic about this: tech tycoon Elon Musk \u2013 has now also joined xAI in the race for the best artificial intelligence \u2013 took legal action against the for-profit plans. In 2015, he supported the founding of OpenAI as a non-profit organization with a donation of around 50 million dollars.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose company is developing the Llama AI, recently sent a letter to the US government criticizing the development of OpenAI \u2013 from its start as a non-profit organization to its intended status as a for-profit company. He asked the authorities to stop the project. The two OpenAI competitors had not yet responded to the company's more concrete plans on Friday evening.\n\nAnzeige\n\n(nen)"

Horror of Dracula (1958) 6. Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968) 5. Dracula (1931) 4. Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922) 3. Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula (1992) 2. Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979) 1. Nosferatu (2024)\n\nDracula, aka Nosferatu, remains one of the most terrifying and well-known figures in pop culture. Since author Bram Stoker introduced the world to his vampiric vision with his 1897 novel, the character has been adapted into several forms of media over the past 127 years, most recently in Robert Eggers\u2019s Nosferatu.\n\nThere have been multiple movies across different genres that center around the iconic bloodsucker, and it seems like they won\u2019t stop coming anytime soon. While the world continues to embrace the terrors of the legendary vampire, here are the best films centered around Dracula/Nosferatu so far.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n10. Shadow of the Vampire (2000)\n\nThis meta-horror film stands out for presenting a fictionalized account of the production of 1922\u2019s Nosferatu, with F.W. Murnau inadvertently hiring Max Schreck, an actual vampire, to star in his film as Count Orlok.\n\nSuch an unconventional remake makes for an excellent satire of the film industry and its vices, with Murnau being the eccentric, demanding director and Schreck the extreme method actor who\u2019s too into his character. But like the actual Nosferatu, this film is a dark depiction of obsession and how far one is willing to go to satisfy it.\n\n9. Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)\n\nDespite what the film\u2019s title implies, this horror-comedy classic from Abbott and Costello shows the titular duo encountering Bela Lugosi\u2019s Dracula and many other iconic movie monsters in addition to Frankenstein\u2019s monster. The two leads\u2019 brand of rapid, slapstick humor alone makes this movie a noteworthy watch.\n\nHowever, the movie also does a terrific job of replicating the terror, suspense, and chilling atmosphere of the horror films it parodies. With the way it perfectly balances both horror and comedy, Abbott and Costello Meets Frankenstein revolutionized both genres as it blended them together for a boundary-pushing classic.\n\n8. Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)\n\nThe third film in Hammer\u2019s Dracula franchise, Prince of Darkness shows the evil vampire\u2019s frightening resurrection after a group of tourists are invited to his castle. Compared to the first film in the franchise, this sequel utilizes more elements from Stoker\u2019s novel while presenting some unique deviations from the typical Dracula formula.\n\nThough Peter Cushing\u2019s Van Helsing is absent, Andrew Keir fills in quite well with his performance as Father Sandor. Christopher Lee also continues to inject the franchise with sufficient scares with his largely silent, but still terrifying return as Dracula.\n\n7. Horror of Dracula (1958)\n\nUnlike the source material, Horror of Dracula does away with Jonathan Harker early, making Doctor Van Helsing the film\u2019s main protagonist as he investigates his friend\u2019s disappearance in a plat point that\u2019s similar to Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho.\n\nFeaturing big-screen acting legends like Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, director Terence Fisher\u2019s adaptation of Dracula launched an entire series of Dracula films featuring Lee as the evil bloodsucker. The characters in this film could be developed more, especially the female ones. Despite this, the film succeeds without relying on gore to create scares, as it oozes creeping suspense and sinister sexuality to get under its viewer\u2019s skin.\n\n6. Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968)\n\nIn this sequel to Dracula: Prince of Darkness, Christopher Lee\u2019s Dracula returns from the dead after a priest performs an exorcism on his castle. Unlike its predecessors in Hammer\u2019s Dracula franchise, this film features greater personal drama beyond the battle with an evil vampire.\n\nAs the characters face battles with their own faith and lust, this sequel adds more depth to the existential war with the demonic and vengeful Dracula. Also, with Dracula\u2019s victims battling to retain their humanity as they succumb to his spell, this movie puts a unique spin on the \u201cRenfield\u201d archetype and provides greater character development.\n\n5. Dracula (1931)\n\nNot only was this movie the first official adaptation of Dracula, but it was also the first one to utilize sound. This version gives Renfield a greater role in the film, as he takes part of Jonathan\u2019s role and becomes the lens into Dracula\u2019s dark world.\n\nAs a product of classic, studio-era Hollywood, this film\u2019s visual effects and underdeveloped characters leave much to be desired. However, this adaptation stands out due to its chilling atmosphere and Bela Lugosi\u2019s benchmark performance as Count Dracula.\n\n4. Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922)\n\nTechnically, Nosferatu was the first Dracula film, as it was an unapproved adaptation of Bram Stoker\u2019s novel, but with different character names and some plot changes. Though the movie was hit with a plagiarism lawsuit that demanded its destruction, a few prints of the film survived, and cinema was arguably better off for its continued existence.\n\nThis German expressionist film from director F.W. Murnau was revolutionary in its time, establishing several tropes in the vampire genre while pushing the boundaries of cinema with its inventive shots, creepy atmosphere, and sexual undertones.\n\n3. Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula (1992)\n\nDirector Francis Ford Coppola achieved the lofty task of adapting Stoker\u2019s novel in its purest form. Though the film stays true to the source material\u2019s plot, characters, and narrative perspective, it stands out for how it expands upon Dracula\u2019s past, particularly the tragic romance he shares with Mina Harker.\n\nAll in all, Coppola\u2019s version of Dracula is a stylish and erotic nightmare filled with vibrant imagery, jaw-dropping creature designs, and remarkable performances from Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder.\n\n2. Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979)\n\nWhile director Werner Herzog\u2019s adaptation derives several elements from 1922\u2019s Nosferatu, it retains the character names featured in Stoker\u2019s novel. However, Herzog\u2019s film expands on the source material by emphasizing the tragedy of Dracula\u2019s lonely, immortal character. It also presents the death and chaos he unleashes on Lucy\u2019s town in a whole new light, showing how this widespread loss can affect humanity on a spiritual level.\n\nThis slow-burning 1979 remake is one of the more hypnotic and thought-provoking versions of Nosferatu and Dracula, and it still holds up almost 50 years later.\n\n1. Nosferatu (2024)\n\nAfter revolutionizing horror with The Witch and The Lighthouse, director Robert Eggers fulfilled his lifelong dream of remaking Nosferatu with incredible results. This psychosexual nightmare takes a classic silent film and turns it into modern cinema\u2019s version of The Exorcist in terms of terror, artistry, and intensity. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd is virtually unrecognizable as the evil Count Orlok, who steps away from the more sympathetic versions of Dracula and Nosferatu as he tortures Ellen and her loved ones to make her submit to him.\n\nMeanwhile, Lily-Rose Depp gives a shocking and revelatory performance as her character is tormented and possessed by the evil vampire. Not only does the film take the vampire genre story back to its roots, but it reapplies it for a modern age in one of the most unsettlingly primal, but beautifully made horror movies in cinema history."

Elizabeth Benassi, who began working at Maximus UK Services in 2022 at the age of 18, claimed she was unfairly targeted for her choice of footwear, despite other colleagues wearing similar shoes without repercussions.\n\nBenassi\u2019s case was heard at an employment tribunal in Croydon, south London, which ruled in her favour. The tribunal found that the company displayed a \u201cdesire to find fault\u201d with the young employee and had failed to inform her about its dress code policy.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nBenassi, employed for just three months, argued that she was singled out and treated \u201clike a child\u201d by her manager, who criticised her trainers. She told the tribunal that most of her colleagues were in their twenties, but as the youngest employee, she was subjected to excessive scrutiny and \u201cmicromanagement\u201d because of her age.\n\nEmployment Judge Forwell noted that Benassi was unfairly confronted about her footwear upon arriving at the office. \u201cNo allowance was made for the fact that she was new and may not have been familiar with the dress code,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIt was therefore a clear unfairness and indicates a desire to find fault.\u201d\n\nThe tribunal also rejected the agency\u2019s claim that Benassi had been made aware of the dress code policy. Judge Forwell pointed out that had such information been provided, it would likely have been mentioned in an email exchange at the time.\n\nMaximus UK Services, a company that provides recruitment services for the Department for Work and Pensions, denied any wrongdoing. However, the tribunal found the company guilty of victimisation and awarded Benassi \u00a329,187 in compensation.\n\nWhile the tribunal sided with Benassi on the issue of victimisation, her additional claim of age-related harassment was dismissed.\n\nThe case has sparked discussions about the treatment of young workers in the workplace and the potential for age-based discrimination. The tribunal\u2019s ruling underscores the importance of clear communication around workplace policies, as well as the need for fair treatment of new employees."

            "article_content": "Part 1: From the Roots of the Web to Columbia SC Website Design Excellence\n\nWeb design isn\u2019t just about making a website look pretty\u2014though that\u2019s often the initial impression people get when visiting a business online. It\u2019s about weaving a story, engaging visitors, and guiding them through an experience they\u2019ll remember. At Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve spent nearly two decades perfecting this craft, transforming how businesses in Columbia, South Carolina, and beyond connect with their audiences. Let me tell you, when you\u2019ve worked through every trend, from neon-tinted text on black backgrounds in the early 2000s to today\u2019s minimalist, responsive designs, you start to see the web as more than just code and graphics; it becomes an ecosystem of endless possibilities.\n\nThe Evolution of Design: From HTML Tables to Responsive Frameworks\n\nLet\u2019s rewind a little to the early 2000s. Websites back then were like those department store mannequins from the \u201890s\u2014awkwardly posed, overly dressed, and not very functional. Everything was laid out using HTML tables, CSS was still in its infancy, and JavaScript? Well, it was more likely to crash your browser than enhance your experience. In Columbia, SC, website design was no exception. Local businesses were just dipping their toes into the digital pond, and a \u201ccontact us\u201d form was considered cutting-edge.\n\nFast forward to today, and everything has changed. Frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS have turned the design process into something akin to Lego-building. You pick your components, snap them together, and voil\u00e0! But here\u2019s where it gets tricky: while these frameworks make development faster, they also come with their downsides. Bootstrap sites, for instance, can sometimes look overly similar, which is something Web Design Columbia actively avoids. Cookie-cutter designs? Not on our watch.\n\nThe Intersection of Creativity and Technology\n\nA fascinating statistic from a 2023 global survey showed that 38% of website visitors will stop engaging with a site if the layout is unattractive or the content is poorly structured. That\u2019s why Columbia SC website design firms like ours emphasize aesthetics and functionality. Every pixel and line of code has a purpose.\n\nOne of our more unique projects was redesigning a legacy site that had been built on Joomla\u2014an oldie but a goodie in the content management world. The site was functional but far from user-friendly, and the client wanted something that could compete with modern platforms like Shopify or WordPress. After hours of brainstorming, we restructured their database, migrated their content, and built a sleek, responsive design that worked seamlessly on every device. Here\u2019s a fun fact: that site saw a 120% increase in user engagement within six months.\n\nResponsive Design: A Double-edged Sword\n\nResponsive design\u2014where your website automatically adjusts to fit any screen size\u2014is one of the most significant innovations in web design. But, like all technologies, it\u2019s not without its challenges. Take Columbia SC website design as an example: while mobile responsiveness is now a given, optimizing for speed on mobile devices remains a headache for developers worldwide. According to a Google report, 53% of mobile users will leave a site if it takes longer than three seconds to load.\n\nAt Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve tackled this issue by combining the best server configurations with cutting-edge tools like Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights. We even use Cloudflare to reduce load times and improve security. But even with these tools, challenges persist. Older devices, for instance, often struggle with sites that rely heavily on JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. The balance between functionality and speed remains a dance we\u2019re perfecting.\n\nPlatforms of Choice: The Good, The Bad, and the Pricey\n\nWhen discussing Columbia, SC, website design, platforms like WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace must be mentioned. WordPress, which powers over 43% of the web, offers unparalleled flexibility, but its open-source nature can also be a curse. Owning a classic car is like owning a classic car: You can customize it endlessly, but without proper maintenance, it can break down.\n\nWix and Squarespace, on the other hand, cater to those who want a simpler, drag-and-drop solution. They\u2019re fantastic for small businesses just starting out but often lack the scalability needed as they grow. A client in Columbia once came to us frustrated that their Wix site couldn\u2019t handle the traffic spikes during their annual sale. We rebuilt their site on a more robust platform, ensuring it could grow alongside their business.\n\n\n\nThe Role of SEO in Modern Web Design\n\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) isn\u2019t just a buzzword; it\u2019s the lifeline of any website. Columbia SC website design services like ours incorporate SEO strategies right from the planning stage. But here\u2019s a reality check: even the best design can\u2019t mask poorly executed SEO. Google\u2019s algorithms are sophisticated, and they prioritize user experience above all else.\n\nOne of the common complaints we\u2019ve heard globally is about platforms like Shopify and Wix, where SEO capabilities are somewhat limited. While these platforms offer basic SEO features, they often fall short when compared to fully customizable options available on WordPress. That\u2019s why we emphasize starting with a clear SEO strategy, using tools like Semrush and Ahrefs to track performance, and continuously refining it.\n\nPart 2: The Heart of Columbia SC Website Design and What Lies Ahead\n\nColumbia\u2019s Unique Web Design Landscape\n\nColumbia, South Carolina, isn\u2019t just known for its southern charm and vibrant business community; it\u2019s also becoming a hotspot for innovative digital solutions. Web Design Columbia has been at the forefront, leveraging nearly two decades of experience to create designs that resonate with both local and global audiences. While the city might not have the tech reputation of Silicon Valley, it offers something unique\u2014a personal touch that prioritizes relationships over transactions.\n\nThis focus on collaboration sets Columbia, SC, website design apart. One memorable project involved a local nonprofit organization that needed to overhaul its aging Zen-Cart platform completely. We migrated their site to Shopify, ensuring a smooth transition without downtime. Here\u2019s the kicker: the new site\u2019s streamlined design and improved navigation led to a 200% increase in donor contributions within just three months. Success stories like these highlight the power of combining technical expertise with understanding community needs.\n\nWhen Design Meets Development\n\nYou can\u2019t talk about Columbia, SC, website design without diving into the synergy between design and development. Think of it like a duet: the designer sets the tone, and the developer brings the melody to life. But achieving harmony isn\u2019t always easy. Many businesses globally complain about miscommunication between these two roles, which can result in sites that look great but function poorly\u2014or vice versa.\n\nAt Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve found that fostering collaboration between designers and developers is key. We use tools like Figma for wireframing and prototyping, ensuring that everyone\u2014clients included\u2014has a clear vision of the final product. Interestingly, a 2022 survey revealed that 60% of website redesigns fail to meet client expectations due to a lack of proper planning. That\u2019s why we emphasize transparency and iteration, involving clients at every process stage.\n\nThe Downsides of Modern Web Trends\n\nWhile modern web design trends like minimalism and parallax scrolling can be visually stunning, they also have pitfalls. Minimalist designs, for example, often sacrifice functionality for aesthetics. A user might love a site\u2019s clean, open look but get frustrated when basic navigation isn\u2019t intuitive.\n\nAnother trend that divides opinion is parallax scrolling, in which background images move slower than foreground content to create a 3D effect. While this can add depth and dynamism, it can also lead to slower load times and compatibility issues on older devices. Columbia, SC, website design projects must carefully weigh these pros and cons.\n\nOne of our more challenging projects involved incorporating parallax elements into a local restaurant\u2019s website. The result was visually spectacular, but we quickly realized that some older browsers struggled to handle the animations. By optimizing the code and offering a simplified version for less capable devices, we struck a balance that satisfied all users.\n\nGlobal Inspirations, Local Applications\n\nWeb design is a global language, but its application varies by region. In Columbia, South Carolina, businesses value authenticity and practicality\u2014traits that don\u2019t always align with the flashy, experimental designs you might see in tech hubs like New York or San Francisco. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Columbia, SC, website design lacks innovation.\n\nWe often draw inspiration from global trends and adapt them to fit local sensibilities. Take the rise of dark mode, for instance. Platforms like Twitter and Slack initially popularized this feature and has been praised for reducing eye strain and saving device battery life. While dark mode is trendy, we\u2019ve found that it doesn\u2019t always suit every brand\u2019s identity. A local healthcare provider, for example, might benefit more from lighter, more calming color schemes.\n\nThe Future of Columbia SC Website Design\n\nLooking ahead, the future of web design in Columbia\u2014and globally\u2014is shaping up to be exciting and complex. Technologies like AI and machine learning are beginning to influence how websites are built and maintained. Tools like ChatGPT and MidJourney are already assisting with content creation and design ideation, but they\u2019re not without their limitations. AI lacks the nuance of human creativity, so it\u2019s better used as an assistant rather than a replacement.\n\nIn Columbia, businesses are starting to embrace these technologies, but cautiously. Web Design Columbia has experimented with AI-driven analytics tools to predict user behavior and optimize design choices. While these tools provide valuable insights, they\u2019re only as good as the data they\u2019re fed. As the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out.\n\nWhy Experience Matters\n\nIn an industry where trends change faster than you can say \u201cresponsive design,\u201d experience is a critical asset. Columbia, SC, website design firms like ours have weathered countless changes, from the rise of mobile-first strategies to the current emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity.\n\nOne interesting fact: according to a 2023 report, websites built by experienced teams are 50% more likely to meet their performance goals than those built by less seasoned developers. That\u2019s because experience isn\u2019t just about knowing what works; it\u2019s about knowing what doesn\u2019t. At Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve learned to anticipate challenges and adapt quickly, ensuring every project succeeds.\n\nYour Digital Journey Starts Here\n\nWeb design is more than just a service; it\u2019s a partnership. Whether you\u2019re looking to revamp an outdated site or build something entirely new, the team at Web Design Columbia is here to guide you every step of the way.

            "article_content": "Phil Ashley/Getty Images\n\nThe TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans.\n\nThis crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. \ud83d\udcb0\n\nAly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes\u2026 but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one.\n\nAlso: AI isn't the next big thing - here's what is\n\nThousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem.\n\nThis ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. \ud83d\ude2e\n\nI'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.)\n\nLow key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. \ud83c\udf7f\n\nThat said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's.\n\nQuick Intro\n\nIf you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer.\n\nAlso: 3 lucrative side hustles you can start right now with OpenAI's Sora video generator\n\nI've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. \ud83d\ude80\n\nNeedless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses.\n\nBTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts.\n\nAll that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. \ud83d\ude05\n\nLet's recap how we got here\n\nThe TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024.\n\nByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. \ud83d\ude24\n\nHere is the recap:\n\nDeadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension).\n\nConsequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned.\n\nReason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government.\n\nTikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment.\n\nThe irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. \ud83d\ude43\n\nOn December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban.\n\nAlso: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning\n\nIn response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban.\n\nAs of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain.\n\nIn addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. \ud83d\ude31\n\nTikTok ban could leave a void Meta won't fill\n\nTikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. \ud83d\ude33\n\nMeta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money.\n\nFor advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead\n\nTo understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible.\n\nThere are two main stages of awareness:\n\nIntent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you\u2026 you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward.\n\nDiscovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery.\n\nDiscovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly.\n\nStay with me; you need to understand this to see the void\u2026 \u23f3\n\nTikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there.\n\nAlso: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today\n\nSince TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers.\n\nWhat's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers.\n\nWithout TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nThe biggest winners\u2026\n\nThe obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. \ud83c\udfc6\n\nGoogle is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine.\n\nYeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine.\n\nAmazon also stands to benefit.\n\nTikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful.\n\nAlso: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead\n\nOverall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people.\n\nI know what you are thinking: \"You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more.\" And I feel strongly about that.\n\nHowever, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. \ud83d\udd12\n\nLooking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day.\n\nThe biggest loser no one is talking about...\n\nByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. \ud83d\udcc9\n\nBut guess who's probably low-key pissed about this?\n\nShopify!\n\nAlso: This pocket camera has fully replaced my iPhone for video shooting\n\nShopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. \ud83e\udd1d\n\nTikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales.\n\nTikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions.\n\nAll I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. \ud83e\udd14\n\nWhat next?\n\nIf you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you.\n\nThe obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem.\n\nThe real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it.\n\nHere's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience.\n\nI've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs.\n\nThe pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. \ud83d\udce2\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThink about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform.\n\nIf you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn.\n\nMy two cents\n\nAs someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. \ud83e\udd74\n\nAs a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry.\n\nAs a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out.\n\nAs a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price.\n\nAs a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld.\n\nAs an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it.\n\nThat said, in situations like this, I always remember this quote\u2026\n\n\"It's not happening to you. It's happening for you.\" \ud83e\udd17\n\nAs cheesy as it sounds, that saying has served me well during tough times.\n\n\ud83d\ude07 Hope this helps; I'm rooting for you.\n\nP.S. \ud83d\udce9 Want more data-driven marketing insights?

            "article_content": "\n\n\n\nThe US Congress has been attempting to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs - as our maps show the places in the UK and America most likely to be visited by extra-terrestrials.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023. That was a 20% drop from 497 UFO sightings in 2022 and also lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484).\n\nIt found that people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39).\n\nREAD MORE: Gorgeous Somerset cafe which perfects cake for the kids and coffee for the parents\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: The Saturday night when 85 cows thundered through a Somerset town\n\nYou can see what UFO encounters have been reported where you live using our interactive map.\n\n\n\n\n\nSightings documented in the UK included:\n\n\n\nA \u201clong cigar-shaped craft with three or four roundish patterns on it\u201d was observed for 20 minutes before it \u201cvanished like a light being switched off\u201d above Chester in Cheshire in October last year.\n\nA \u201crocket-type object\u201d was spotted flying above the clouds over Hartlepool \u201cextremely fast and soundless with flames over the front\u201d in November 2022.\n\nA 30ft to 40ft wide \u201cround saucer-like object with detailed outer rim\u201d was seen \u201chovering over a house\u201d in Bedworth, Warwickshire, in January.\n\nSome Somerset sightings include two round discs, a dull red colour, following the flight path of an aircraft with no sound unlike the aircraft over Shepton Mallet, a moving light disappeared at Orion. Followed by multiple other lights all in the same place moving West to East over Glastonbury, and a tic-tac like shape moving very slowly in the sky above Spaxton.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings (48%) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25%) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17%), \u201csphere\u201d, (10%) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (9%).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34). When it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts. Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold - former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team - told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d. However, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US submarines and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government - or any other government - are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d He insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by Chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies. While the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be."

            "article_content": "Bright orange 'UFO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City,' raising concern among residents of the Big Apple over the holiday week.\n\nOn Friday, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted the video to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nUsers local to the New York City area confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nOther users deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious, and was shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."
