            "article_content": "An upcoming documentary about the UFO/UAP phenomenon promises to be the most well-sourced and credible film every made about the buzzy topic and its first trailer has just been released (below).\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure, by filmmaker Dan Farah, features on-record interviews with 34 current and former senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community with direct knowledge of unidentified aerial phenomena. The film contends there has been an 80-year cover-up of the existence of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse engineer UFO technology. As announced earlier Wednesday, The Age of the Disclosure has earned first-time director Farah a coveted premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival, where it will screen at the historic Paramount Theatre in March.\n\nSome of the officials interviewed include newly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio (who says in the trailer that, when it comes to this subject, \u201ceven presidents are operating on a need-to-know basis\u201d), New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds and General Jim Clapper (who was a U.S. director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama).\n\nFrom the official description: \u201cThe film was granted unprecedented access and support from senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community. Everyone interviewed in the film has direct knowledge of UAP as a result of their work for the U.S. Government. The film exposes the profound impact the situation has on the future of humanity, while providing a look behind the scenes with those at the forefront of the bipartisan disclosure effort.\u201d\n\nJim Semivan, who spent 25 years as a senior official with the CIA, says in the trailer: \u201cUAPs are here, they are real and they are not human.\u201d Adds Jay Stratton, former director of the U.S. government\u2019s UAP task force: \u201cThe first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come. This is similar to The Manhattan Project; this is the atomic weapon on steroids.\u201d\n\nFormer Department of Defense official and longtime UAP disclosure advocate Christopher Mellon declares, \u201cThis is the biggest discovery in human history,\u201d while former Department of Defense official and member of the government\u2019s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program Luis Elizondo says, \u201cYou have information being locked away that can change the trajectory of [our] species.\u201d\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure was made in secret over the past two years and filmmakers are currently in talks for commercial distribution plans; Cinetic is handling domestic sales.\n\nThe film follows a surge of public interest in the subject and two bipartisan congressional hearings over the past year where former officials and whistleblowers gave testimony claiming non-human intelligent life has visited Earth and that the U.S. has been engaged in a decades-long cover-up in an effort to reverse-engineer alien technology.\n\nFarah\u2019s producing credits include Ready Player One, which likewise scored a SXSW Film Festival premiere at the Paramount in 2018. The Age of Disclosure is a Farah Films production, in association with Born Ready Films. Produced and directed by Farah, executive producers are Colin Frederick, Andrew Farah and Shara Senderoff."

            "article_content": "My cats are not usually picky about much, but they hate one thing: a traditional water bowl.\n\nThey\u2019d rather not drink water at all if it\u2019s not moving. So much so, that my one cat wound up developing crystals and had to have emergency surgery to remove a blockage. How dramatic!\n\nBut thankfully they both love water fountains. They liked the Petlibro fountain I originally got, but it pales in comparison to how much they like this BUETEKA water fountain from Chewy. I\u2019d like to think it is because it is shaped like a UFO and they are just two tiny aliens who live in my home.\n\nMy cats, Luna and Sirius, have expensive tastes. They\u2019re on a wet-food exclusive prescription diet, have two different Litter Robots to do their business, and they liked the $50 water fountain significantly more than the $30 one I originally bought.\n\nThey must get their expensive taste from me, their mother, because I liked this fountain more, as well.\n\nMy initial reason for liking the BUETEKA water fountain more was simply aesthetics. I bought this because it is a cute little UFO. It also has near-excellent reviews: 4.5 stars and nearly 500 ratings on Chewy. Over 80% of the people who own this love it so much, they gave it 5 stars, and I am also someone who\u2019d rate it 5 stars.\n\nBUETEKA Cat Water Fountain Features\n\nThis Chewy cat water fountain has a number of features that stand out, including:\n\nA unique catnip ball dispenser\n\nA 1.6L water tank\n\n2 water flow modes and an adjustable water outlet pipe\n\nA visible water-level indicator\n\nAn ultra-quiet smart pump\n\nMultiple filters that help to sterilize the water and remove hair, debris, and impurities\n\nA small footprint: 7.87 inches L x 7.87 inches W x 8.27 inches H\n\nWe don\u2019t use the catnip ball in the dispenser, because Luna and Sirius get rowdy enough in the middle of the night, the last thing I need is catnip hyping them up for 3 AM zoomies.\n\nThe water level indicator makes it very easy to spot how much water is in the fountain, so you know when it is low and needs to be refilled. Between my two cats, I typically only need to refill it twice a week.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a cat water fountain?\n\nIf you own a cat, you\u2019ve probably spotted them trying to drink water from the faucet once or twice. Sirius used to love doing this. Cats like moving water, thanks to their ancestors preferring to drink from moving streams over puddles in the wild.\n\nThere are some health benefits to buying a cat water fountain though, outside of letting your cat feel like they\u2019re the lion of the house.\n\nFountains encourage more drinking\n\nDrinking from a water fountain can help prevent health issues, like cystitis, urinary crystals, kidney issues, and more\n\nFountain designs can lessen whisker fatigue\n\nThe first two go hand in hand. The more water your cat drinks, the less likely they are to develop urinary crystals or have kidney issues. Increasing water intake is often a key strategy your veterinarian will implement if your pet is experiencing any of these issues. I know it firsthand, as Sirius developed crystals in 2023 due to previously having a diet that consisted of mainly dry food and he used to only have an old-school water bowl. After his surgery, we switched him to a water fountain and a wet food diet, and then the crystals pretty much vanished. He\u2019s now gone 13 months without issue.\n\nHis sister Luna has also reaped the benefits, not needing the water fountain like her brother, but she is still drinking water more now and making far less of a mess at her food and water station.\n\nWhy this cat water fountain?\n\nI have my theories on why my cats prefer the BUETEKA fountain over the original fountain I initially bought. They still use the other one, but I find them drinking from the BUETEKA fountain significantly more.\n\nThere is a little more space between the water dish and the spout on the BUETEKA fountain. I\u2019d assume that this allows them more space to catch the moving water before it hits the bowl. This is also a circle design, instead of an oval, so again, there is a little more space for them to stick their head over the bowl to get to the fountain\u2019s spout.\n\nThe BUETEKA water fountain also has a light blue light that is easy for cats to see, even in the dark. But it is not so bright that it will keep a human awake at night. Whereas the other fountain they have does not have a light for them to find the fountain at night.\n\nThe #1 feature about this water fountain that makes it infinitely better than the other fountain we own is that I never have to unplug it from the wall to clean it. The power cord connects in the middle, not the end that plugs into the wall, which makes this very easy to unplug without having to crawl around to get to the wall plug. This makes cleaning the water fountain substantially easier. It comes apart in seconds and I can wash each part in under a minute. I can either let it air dry or I can wipe it down and replace the water all in under five minutes.\n\nIt is simple to use, easy to clean, and only $50, which really is not that expensive for a product that my cats love and use every single day.\n\nGet the Bueteka Spaceship Ultra-Quiet Dog & Cat Water Fountain from Chewy for $50."

LAPRESSE\n\nIn a series of perplexing events, multiple UFO sightings have been reported and recorded over several days across California, particularly in the Fresno area. These sightings have sparked a wave of curiosity and concern, as both residents and authorities are left pondering the origins of these unidentified flying objects.\n\nThe string of sightings began with a mysterious light hovering over downtown Fresno in the early hours, just past 4 a.m. Local news station Fox 26 captured the first sighting on camera, showing a light that appeared to move swiftly before coming to a stationary hover. Earl Grey Anderson, a field investigator for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), reviewed the footage and classified it as an unidentified flying object.\n\nTaylor Swift's Heartfelt Message to Swifties\n\nThe following day, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara documented another UFO sighting, this time in the daylight. The footage added to the mounting intrigue surrounding these mysterious occurrences. A few days later, a private pilot reported seeing a white object trailing his aircraft at an altitude of 3,500 feet over downtown Fresno. Despite radioing the local airport tower for assistance, the pilot lost sight of the object shortly after.\n\nStill concern over what happened\n\nSeveral Fresno residents have also come forward with similar reports, describing their encounters with the unidentified objects. The recent sightings have reignited public fascination with UFOs, particularly as the Pentagon continues to release declassified information about aerial phenomena.\n\nWhile some speculate about extraterrestrial origins, others consider the possibility of advanced human-made technology or natural phenomena. Authorities are urging residents to remain calm as investigations continue.\n\nDespite the ongoing mystery, the sightings have undoubtedly captured the imaginations of those who witness these unexplained objects in the California skies. As the story develops, residents and authorities alike remain vigilant, hoping to uncover the truth behind these enigmatic appearances."

            "article_content": "Credit: Rainer Fuhrmann/Shutterstock\n\nAccording to a 2022 poll from YouGov, 39% of Americans believe they have some form of paranormal ability. About a quarter of that group think they can sense other people's auras or emotion; 15% say they can hear voices or sounds from ghosts; and about 13% think they can see events from the past or future.\n\nThis is a public service announcement to the nearly 13 million Americans who believe they have supernatural powers: You are leaving a lot of money on the table. Various groups of skeptics worldwide have put a total of $1,408,424 (and one goat) on the table, and all that filthy lucre is just waiting to be collected by anyone who can manifest paranormal power.\n\nThe specific kinds of powers you need to demonstrate to win the prizes run the gamut. Dutch organization Stichting Skepsis will shell out 12 grand to practitioners of some forms of alternative medicine who can demonstrate its effectiveness (so if you're into applied kinesiology, give 'em a shot), and you can get a free goat from Fayetteville Freethinkers for proving a \"fulfilled Biblical prophecy.\" But whether you're able to see the future, move objects with your mind, or talk to spirits, there's a prize out there for you.\n\nThe history of paranormal prizes\n\nThe first monetary prize for proof of paranormal activity was offered by Scientific American in 1922. In the midst of the spiritualism movement, the publication offered $2,500 for anyone who could produce a \"spirit photograph\" (a photo that captures an image of a ghost) under controlled conditions, and $2,500 for anyone able to produce a \"visible psychic manifestation.\"\n\nFamous (at the time) medium George Valiantine gave it a shot and was able to create the illusion of a trumpet floating in the air in a dark room, but the test committee (which included Harry Houdini) had connected his chair to a light in an adjoining room, which lit up whenever Valiantine left his chair, which was also every time the trumpet appeared. Valiantine was proven a fraud, and Scientific American kept their cash.\n\nThe most famous bounty for psychic ability is the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi, a magician turned professional skeptic, first offered a prize of $1,000 back in 1964, but the cash grew to a million by 1996. Between 1964 and 2015 when the prize was discontinued, over 1,000 people applied, but none were successful at demonstrating their supernatural power under controlled conditions. No remote viewers were able to remote view. No dowsers were able to find hidden objects. No mind reader was able to read minds.\n\nHow paranormal prizes can backfire\n\nYou'd think that a 100% failure rate might make people question the reality of psychic abilities, but for a lot of people, public failure can make psychic abilities seem more plausible. At least that's how it worked for Uri Geller. Geller, who's still around and still claiming supernatural power, began gaining attention in the early 1970s for his supposed ability to bend spoons with his mind.\n\nWhile he never tried for James Randi's prize, the two had a famous run-in on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show that demonstrated the problems with disproving paranormal activity. Carson, who had been magician, was skeptical of Geller's claims, and brought him on his show and presented him with some tests that Randi helped develop.\n\nIf you want to see some uncomfortable TV, check it out:\n\nIf you don't have the 20 minutes to spare, Carson lets Geller take his time and try any of a series of test of his ability, but Geller can't. With Carson watching carefully and not allowing Geller control of any of the props, Geller can't bend a spoon with his mind; he can't determine whether a container holds water. He can't do anything.\n\nYou'd think a public failure this complete would have ended Geller's career, but it had the opposite effect. Geller blamed his failure on \"not feeling strongly\" and claimed he might have been \"blocking himself\" that night. Many apparently saw Geller's failure as proof that he was the real thing; after all, if he was a magician, the tricks would have worked. Geller then became a popular guest on other talk shows where he was able to perform his tricks successfully under less controlled conditions, and a star was born.\n\nWhy disproving anything is difficult\n\nWhile Uri Geller and other high-profile psychics are performers and are no doubt aware of how they're achieving their results, the 13 million or so Americans who believe they possess special powers aren't being deceitful\u2014it's just easy to believe in the supernatural. When something unusual happens, when a one-in-a-million occurrence occurs, it's easy to see that as proof of a mysterious, unexplainable something. If you're thinking about a friend and they text you that very minute, how can you not see that as evidence of some weird connection? But one-in-a-million events happen to over 300 people in America every single day, and there's no James Randi or Johnny Carson around to provide a controlled experiment to prove it's just a coincidence, to explain that you probably think of people all the time who don't text you that minute.\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong. If I am, there's over a million dollars and a goat out there waiting for the right person to come along and claim them."

During a Jan. 21 episode of Late Night, Fox recalled how she was introduced to the paranormal spirit after moving into her house. But according to Fox, she has no problems with living somewhere haunted. Apparently, Beauty only brings good energy, and Fox now considers the ghost to be the \u201cmatriarch of the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually have a ghost that lives in my house right now,\u201d Fox told Seth Meyers on the show. \u201cI feel like I talk about her a lot, and I feel so bad. I'm, like, putting her on blast. Like, I don't know if she wants me to talk about her! Her name is Beauty, and she came with the house; she didn't follow me there.\u201d\n\nWhen Fox first moved in, she didn\u2019t know about Beauty. \u201cIt was funny: It begins like any ghost story. I felt a pull toward this house, and it was a full moon, and then I was like, \u2018That's it. I'm getting the house,\u2019\u201d she explained to Meyers. \u201cAnd then when we went down to the basement after we'd already moved all our stuff in, there was a little letter from the previous owners basically saying, like, \u2018This is Beauty.\u2019 And it had all her things: her hairbrush, her mirror.\u201d\n\nNBC/NBCUniversal/Getty Images\n\nMeyers clarified, \u201cWait, the owners waited 'til you moved in and then left a note in the basement?\u201d He added, \u201cThat is some really dirty \u2014 I've heard some bad New York real estate stuff...\u201d Fox replied, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nDespite the bait-and-switch, Fox appreciates her unexpected housemate. \u201cShe's wonderful. She's like the matriarch of the house,\u201d she added. Apparently, her three-year-old son, Valentino, is also a fan. \u201cShe watches over us, and we love her. My son actually sees her. I don't see her, but my son will say, \u2018I saw her, I saw her.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Fox has discussed Beauty. In January 2024, she gave a similar update during a red carpet interview, shared on Instagram by Sundance. (At the time, Fox was promoting her horror film Presence, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The film \u2014 a ghost story \u2014 comes out in theaters on Jan. 24. She was also promoting the project on Late Night.) \u201cShe lived in the house for pretty much her whole life, and we have a whole shrine to her in our basement,\u201d Fox said of Beauty at the time. \u201cShe\u2019s a nice ghost, so we\u2019re not worried.\u201d"

But according to her, she doesn\u2019t mind one bit.\n\n\u201cI actually have a ghost that lives in my house right now,\u201d the actor, 34, told host Seth Meyers on Tuesday\u2019s episode of \u201cLate Night.\u201d \u201cI feel like I talk about her a lot, and I feel so bad.

She\u2019s like the matriarch of the house,\u201d she told Meyers. \u201cShe watches over us, and we love her. My son actually sees her.

The platform features an open application programming interface library and adapter modules and incorporates BioNeMo\u2019s AI and machine learning modeling capabilities into its workflows. BioNeMo is a collection of ready-made tools for designing and training biomolecular AI models for drug discovery, protein engineering, and virtual screening processes.\n\nThe proof-of-concept was designed to demonstrate the power of pairing AI with lab orchestration to automate molecular screening. Using both solutions, Artificial automated a workflow for screening candidate compounds for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease which is critical for viral replication and a target for COVID-19 therapies. The results \u201csuccessfully demonstrated how AI-driven methodologies can accelerate virtual screening and drug discovery processes,\u201d the company stated.\n\nWhile highlighting the benefits of the integration, Artificial\u2019s CEO David Fuller noted that \u201cto accelerate the development of gene therapies and life-saving drugs, or rapid pandemic response, the industry is increasingly recognizing the importance of adopting the latest breakthroughs in AI and machine learning\u2014it is where the market is heading.\u201d\n\nThe company also announced that it has received ISO 27001 and SOC 2 accreditations, which \u201creflect our dedication to our customers\u2019 security and compliance needs and give them confidence in our solutions as they go on this journey,\u201d he added. ISO 27001, the international standard for information security management, validates Artificial\u2019s framework for protecting data and minimizing security risks. The SOC 2 accreditation recognizes the company\u2019s operational transparency and commitment to safeguarding sensitive information.\n\nArtificial will showcase its platform during the 2025 Society of Laboratory Automation and Screening Conference which is taking place in San Diego, CA.\n\nThe partnership with Artificial is just one of several involving the use of Nvidia\u2019s artificial intelligence capabilities. Recently, Nvidia announced a partnership with Mayo Clinic focused on applying AI to digital pathology. The company also has an agreement with Illumina to pair AI and genomics technologies for use in drug discovery, clinical research, and health applications."

            "article_content": "Paleontologists have found a massive dinosaur footprint, measuring a full 92 centimeters (roughly 35 inches) across.\n\nThis colossal footprint hints at the existence of a truly gigantic dinosaur \u2013 potentially larger than even the fearsome Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\nIt was unearthed in Mongolia by Okayama University of Science (OUS) and the Institute of Paleontology, Mongolian Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe footprint belongs to hadrosaurid dinosaurs \u2014 famously known for their distinctive flat, duck-like beaks. They belong to the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae.\n\nDinosaur footprint depiction. Okayama University of Science\n\nMassive footprints\n\nThis massive footprint is believed to belong to a giant Saurolophus, a duck-billed dinosaur estimated to exceed 15 meters in length. This would make it larger than even famous predators like Tyrannosaurus Rex and Tarbosaurus.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, its skeleton remains have not been found yet.\n\nSaurolophus is mostly known for its long, spike-like crest that projects upward and backward from its skull. Like other hadrosaurs, it had a broad, flat beak resembling a duck's bill. These dinosaurs lived during the Late Cretaceous period.\n\nThe paleontological team made another major discovery: a massive trackway of 13 fossilized footprints. Each of these impressive footprints measures 85 centimeters in width, and the entire trackway extends for 24 meters.\n\nThis remarkable find was accompanied by the discovery of numerous other fossilized footprints.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile fossilized skeletons provide invaluable insights into dinosaur anatomy and physiology, fossilized tracks offer a unique window into their behavior and interactions with their environment.\n\n\"The identification of 14 trackways, including one found before 2018, enables the analysis of posture, walking style, speed, and group behavior \u2014details that cannot be inferred from skeletal fossils,\" said Dr. Shinobu Ishigaki, Director of the OUS Museum of Dinosaur Research, who led the excavation work.\n\nFootprint could provide valuable insights\n\nResearchers conducted an investigation in the western Gobi Desert between June 1 to 15, 2024. This specific site was first spotted during a joint survey in 2018. It is recognized as a key locality for the discovery of large hadrosaurid footprint fossils, making it a prime location for further paleontological research.\n\nThis finding fuels excitement among paleontologists. It raises the possibility that the skeletons of these colossal dinosaurs might be discovered in the region.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnearthing such skeletal remains would provide invaluable insights into the anatomy, behavior, and ecology of these gigantic creatures.\n\nBefore this discovery, the largest known hadrosaurid skeleton belonged to Shantungosaurus, discovered in China. This discovery in Mongolia suggests that similarly massive hadrosaur skeletons might also be found in this region.\n\n\"Our next goal is to uncover the full skeleton of the large Saurolophus responsible for these footprints,\" stated Dr. Ishigaki in the press release.\n\nIn another discovery earlier, the UK's largest dinosaur trackway site was uncovered in an Oxfordshire quarry. Nearly 200 massive footprints were discovered, dating back approximately 166 million years.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe site showcases evidence of various dinosaurs, including the predatory Megalosaurus (reaching 9 meters in length) and herbivorous dinosaurs that were even larger.\n\nThis discovery provides valuable insights into the diverse dinosaur life that once thrived in the UK. This exceptional find was made by researchers from the Universities of Oxford and Birmingham."

            "article_content": "OpenAI did not respond to questions about its lobbying efforts.\n\nBut perhaps more important, the disclosure is a clear signal of the company\u2019s arrival as a political player, as its first year of serious lobbying ends and Republican control of Washington begins. While OpenAI\u2019s lobbying spending is still dwarfed by its peers\u2019\u2014Meta tops the list of Big Tech spenders, with more than $24 million in 2024\u2014the uptick comes as it and other AI companies have helped redraw the shape of AI policy.\n\nFor the past few years, AI policy has been something like a whack-a-mole response to the risks posed by deepfakes and misinformation. But over the last year, AI companies have started to position the success of the technology as pivotal to national security and American competitiveness, arguing that the government must therefore support the industry\u2019s growth. As a result, OpenAI and others now seem poised to gain access to cheaper energy, lucrative national security contracts, and a more lax regulatory environment that\u2019s unconcerned with the minutiae of AI safety.\n\nWhile the big players seem more or less aligned on this grand narrative, messy divides on other issues are still threatening to break through the harmony on display at President Trump\u2019s inauguration this week.\n\nAI regulation really began in earnest after ChatGPT launched in November 2022. At that point, \u201ca lot of the conversation was about responsibility,\u201d says Liana Keesing, campaigns manager for technology reform at Issue One, a democracy nonprofit that tracks Big Tech\u2019s influence.\n\nCompanies were asked what they\u2019d do about sexually abusive deepfake images and election disinformation. \u201cSam Altman did a very good job coming in and painting himself early as a supporter of that process,\u201d Keesing says.\n\nOpenAI started its official lobbying effort around October 2023, hiring Chan Park\u2014a onetime Senate Judiciary Committee counsel and Microsoft lobbyist\u2014to lead the effort. Lawmakers, particularly then Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, were vocal about wanting to curb these particular harms; OpenAI hired Schumer\u2019s former legal counsel, Reginald Babin, as a lobbyist, according to data from OpenSecrets. This past summer, the company hired the veteran political operative Chris Lehane as its head of global policy.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s previous disclosures confirm that the company\u2019s lobbyists subsequently focused much of last year on legislation like the No Fakes Act and the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act. The bills did not materialize into law. But as the year went on, the regulatory goals of AI companies began to change. \u201cOne of the biggest shifts that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Keesing says, \u201cis that they\u2019ve really started to focus on energy.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Free Newsletter Get the hottest Fintech Singapore News once a month in your Inbox\n\nThe Asian banking sector in 2025 is set to roar as it stands at the forefront of a global transformation in financial services.\n\nWith annual revenues from corporate and investment banking (CIB) exceeding USD $1.4 trillion, the region commands nearly half of the world\u2019s CIB revenues. Currently, it is also projected to sustain 7% annual growth through 2027. According to Fitch Ratings, Asia\u2019s banking landscape has been reaping the benefits from the stabilising interest rates and positive economic momentum, with pockets of opportunity emerging across diverse markets.\n\nTransaction banking, which includes cash management and trade finance, has also been pivotal in driving growth and deepening client relationships across Asia. Additionally, private credit\u2019s rise in Asia\u2019s financial markets offers an exciting avenue for innovation and competitive positioning.\n\nFollowing a recent webinar on Cracking the Code of Asia\u2019s Banking Trends in 2025 and Beyond, we\u2019ve invited some notable players in the financial landscape to walk us through the latest up-and-coming trends within the banking sector in this region.\n\nThe Asian financial landscape is being revolutionised at lightning speed by innovation. However, amidst this whirlwind, distinguishing actionable trends from the noise is becoming more and more challenging.\n\nEmphasis on Profitability and Growth\n\nTo begin the 2025 list of top banking trends in Asia, we first must take a look at what drives banks the most\u2014profits and growth.\n\nThe journey towards profitability and sustained growth has always become a central theme for digital banks, not just in Asia but also across the globe. Jessica Lam, Group Chief Strategy Officer at WeLab, highlighted that, after years of financial discipline during challenging market conditions (especially during the COVID-19 era), banks are now positioned to focus on scaling their operations.\n\nShe noted that stabilised markets have created an environment ripe for expansion. This is where institutions can confidently invest in new technologies and enter untapped markets.\n\nJessica remarked, \u201cNow that many of us have proven the proof of concept works, the next step is scaling up responsibly.\u201d\n\nThis transition signifies a shift from merely surviving economic turbulence to thriving by leveraging improved financial frameworks and consumer trust. Furthermore, many banks are now exploring strategic partnerships and collaborations, particularly in Southeast Asia, to accelerate growth and streamline operations.\n\nHyper-Personalisation Through AI\n\nAs seen in the top 5 trends shaping the fintech scene in Singapore, AI has been the talk of the town for the banking sector since it first shared its limelight back in 2020. This came as no surprise, as Artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to create highly personalised banking experiences\n\nAlbert Tinio, Co-CEO of GoTyme Bank Philippines, emphasised that AI\u2019s potential lies in its ability to understand individual customer behaviours and preferences at an unprecedented scale. This enables banks to offer bespoke financial solutions tailored to the specific needs of each customer. By doing so, they enhance satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nAlbert elaborated, \u201cWe\u2019re now able to create hyper-connected ecosystems where data shared securely can benefit the end customer.\u201d\n\nSuch hyper-connectivity is not limited to financial services. It also extends across industries, enabling seamless integration of financial tools into everyday activities.\n\nMeanwhile, Taruni Ramamurthi, Head of FSI Malaysia and Philippines at Amazon Web Services, underscored the ethical considerations of AI deployment.\n\nShe stated that AI should be a tool to enhance human-centric banking, ensuring customer trust remains intact. With AI being widely adopted for fraud detection, compliance, and customer engagement, banks are focusing on ensuring transparency and accountability.\n\nThese efforts aim to build and maintain consumer confidence. Generative AI applications are also gaining traction, allowing banks to automate complex processes such as risk analysis and predictive modelling. This, in turn, improves efficiency significantly.\n\nOpen Banking and Collaboration\n\nOpen banking is also gradually becoming a reality across Asia, albeit at varying levels of adoption. Albert highlighted the slow but steady progress in the Philippines. Regulators are working to ensure that consumer consent and data security are prioritised.\n\n\u201cFor open banking to succeed, all institutions need to embrace collaboration and share data responsibly,\u201d Albert stated.\n\nThis collaborative model allows customers to access a consolidated view of their financial information, enabling them to make more informed decisions. Open banking also fosters innovation, as fintechs and third-party providers can develop new products and services through secure API integrations.\n\nJessica echoed these sentiments, adding that the true potential of open banking lies in its ability to create a more inclusive financial ecosystem. Open banking could drive significant advancements in financial inclusion across underserved markets. All of this can be made possible by lowering barriers to entry for new players and promoting interoperability.\n\nBranches Reinvented\n\nThe debate surrounding the relevance of physical branches in the digital era continues. However, their role is undoubtedly evolving. Taruni described branches as becoming \u201cexperience centres\u201d designed to address specific customer needs, such as financial education and community engagement.\n\nIn regions like Southeast Asia, where access to the internet remains uneven, branches serve as critical touchpoints for unbanked populations.\n\nJessica also weighed in on the transformation of branches, stating, \u201cThe purpose of branches should evolve to complement digital offerings, creating seamless customer experiences.\u201d\n\nShe suggested that future branches could blend digital tools with personalised human interactions to bridge the gap between traditional and digital banking. For instance, branches could host financial literacy workshops or offer specialised advisory services for small businesses. This approach fosters deeper customer relationships.\n\nAdding to this global shift, some Hong Kong digital banks are rethinking their strategies and considering physical branches following the HKMA\u2019s recent rule change, as reported by the South China Morning Post (SCMP). This change, aimed at supporting growth, allows for limited physical branches and has prompted digital banks like WeLab Bank, ZA Bank, and Mox Bank to explore offline strategies.\n\nWhile Livi Bank remains fully digital, other players see this as an opportunity to enhance trust and customer experience through face-to-face interactions and advisory services. Traditional banks in Hong Kong are also adapting by focusing on prime locations to attract wealth-management clients or integrating hybrid models, blending sustainability and digital-forward designs.\n\nSuch evolution highlights how branches are increasingly becoming versatile touchpoints that cater to both digital natives and those who value in-person banking experiences.\n\nIn addition, Frankie Wai, Business Solution Director at Temenos, mentioned that technology can further enhance the utility of branches. Features like biometric authentication and AI-powered kiosks could make in-branch services more efficient and appealing to tech-savvy customers while still catering to those who prefer face-to-face interactions.\n\nRegulatory and Ethical Challenges\n\nAs the banking sector embraces technological advancements, the importance of ethical considerations and regulatory compliance is becoming increasingly apparent. Frankie stressed that transparency and accountability must underpin the adoption of AI and open banking.\n\n\u201cRegulators are increasingly focusing on ensuring that technological advancements are used responsibly to safeguard consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nOne key area of concern is data privacy. With the rise of open banking and AI-driven insights, banks are handling vast amounts of sensitive customer information. This requires robust security measures and clear guidelines to prevent misuse.\n\nFurthermore, regulators across Asia are introducing frameworks to govern the ethical use of AI. These frameworks aim to ensure that algorithms do not perpetuate bias or discrimination.\n\nPayment Innovation and Cross-Border Collaboration\n\nThe payments sector is undergoing significant transformation, with cross-border interoperability emerging as a major focus area. Frankie also highlighted Asia\u2019s adoption of global payment standards like ISO 20022. These standards enable seamless and transparent regional transactions.\n\nHe believes that collaboration across borders will redefine how SMEs and individuals engage in international commerce.\n\nProjects such as Nexus, which aim to link payment systems across countries, are poised to create a unified regional payment ecosystem. These advancements not only facilitate trade but also empower micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to expand their reach.\n\nTaruni added that such innovations could be instrumental in driving financial inclusion, particularly for women entrepreneurs and underserved communities.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of AI in payment systems is streamlining operations, enhancing fraud detection, and improving user experiences. From biometric authentication to real-time transaction monitoring, these advancements are setting new benchmarks for efficiency and security in the payments landscape.\n\nThe Asian Edge\n\nThe trends show that the banking sector in Asia in 2025 reflects a unique confluence of rapid growth, innovation, and challenges that set it apart from other regions. The region\u2019s CIB market is growing faster than any other globally, with SMEs and green infrastructure investments acting as pivotal drivers.\n\nHowever, these opportunities exist alongside persistent risks such as volatile real estate markets in China and regulatory uncertainties. Comparatively, while Western economies focus on streamlining mature banking systems, Asia\u2019s landscape requires a nuanced approach to cater to diverse markets and evolving customer expectations.\n\nThe ability to balance technological advancement with ethical practices will be critical. Asia\u2019s banking leaders are well-positioned to redefine the global narrative, focusing on financial inclusion, sustainability, and innovation.\n\nInstitutions that adopt agile strategies and invest in cutting-edge technologies are likely to outpace their competitors, shaping the region\u2019s banking landscape for decades to come. In this pivotal era, Asia is not merely adapting to global banking trends but rather defining them.\n\nThe top banking trends in Asia showcase how the region is leveraging innovation to transform its financial landscape. With advancements in AI, open banking, and cross-border payments, Asia is setting benchmarks for global banking practices.\n\nCatch up on the Cracking the Code of Asia\u2019s Banking Trends in 2025 and Beyond webinar to dive deeper into the trends that are redefining the financial landscape in Asia.\n\nFeatured image credit: Edited from Freepik"

            "article_content": "Over the years, Bill Gates has authored several books addressing critical global issues.\n\nA recent video shared by Bill Gates has left viewers divided between amazement and disgust as the tech billionaire reminisced about a childhood experiment involving a cow lung. The clip, released to promote his memoir Source Code, delves into Gates' fourth-grade experience of bringing a cow lung to school for a show-and-tell activity.\n\nRecalling the incident, Gates shared how his teacher had asked the students to bring something \"interesting\" for show-and-tell. After discussing it with his father, Gates took up an unusual suggestion. \"My dad said, \u2018We could go to the slaughterhouse and get a cow lung,\u2019 and I thought that was a great idea,\" Gates revealed.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe young Gates accompanied his father to the slaughterhouse, picked up the organ, and wrapped it in a white sheet to take to school. Upon unveiling the cow lung in his classroom, his classmates reacted with a mix of fascination and revulsion. Gates performed experiments on the organ, using it to demonstrate how lungs work. \"When I unwrapped it, it was a mixture of awe and disgust. Yeah, I actually didn\u2019t use gloves,\" he admitted in the video.\n\nGates recreated the experiment in the video, this time donning gloves as he handled the organ. He humorously recounted how one of his classmates fainted during his original demonstration. Reflecting on his teacher\u2019s reaction, he recalled her saying, \u201cHey, that was great, but get that thing out of here.\u201d Gates described the experiment as a \u201cbig hit\u201d among his peers at the time.\n\nThe video served as a promotional piece for Source Code, Gates\u2019 first memoir, which he says shares stories from his childhood and the early days of Microsoft. In the memoir, Gates reflects on the experiences, lessons, and relationships that shaped his life and career.\n\n\n\nAccording to GatesNotes, his personal blog, Source Code details the foundation of his life, exploring key moments that defined his journey from a curious child to a global tech icon. The memoir also highlights his vision and the choices that steered his professional and personal development.\n\nGates, who co-founded Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975 after dropping out of Harvard, has become one of the most influential figures in technology and philanthropy. He stepped down from Microsoft\u2019s board in 2020 and has since focused on global challenges such as climate change, health crises, and technology-driven solutions.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nAt the time of stepping down, Gates owned around 1.3% of Microsoft\u2019s shares. By 2022, his philanthropic efforts had led him to donate billions in Microsoft shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reducing his ownership to less than 1%.\n\nOver the years, Gates has authored several books addressing critical global issues, including pandemics, climate change, and technological advancements. However, Source Code marks his first foray into a deeply personal account, providing a glimpse into the man behind the achievements.\n\n\"When my teacher said 'bring something interesting' for show-and-tell, I don\u2019t think she expected a cow lung,\" Gates wrote in the caption of the video. \"It\u2019s just one of many stories from my childhood that I share in my new memoir, Source Code.\""

            "article_content": "The UK retail industry is at a pivotal juncture, driven by technological advancements, evolving consumer expectations, and a heightened focus on sustainability. With 2025 on the horizon, retailers are keenly adapting to key trends that promise to redefine the shopping experience. From artificial intelligence-enhanced operations to the rise of ethical retailing, along with innovative financial solutions, these developments are all playing a crucial role in shaping the future of retail.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and machine learning power personalised retail\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing the retail industry, driving significant transformations across businesses of all sizes. While large multinational retailers are at the forefront of adopting these technologies, other sectors, including healthcare and iGaming platforms like crypto casinos UK players can sign up to are also finding innovative ways to harness AI-driven insights.\n\nAcross sectors, AI is being used to provide highly customized client experiences. In the casino sector, personalised promos and game suggestions based on user history are just two uses of AI. Elsewhere, machine learning algorithms are enhancing operational efficiency by optimising inventory levels, predicting demand, and improving supply chain management.\n\nAI chatbots and virtual assistants are becoming indispensable in customer service, offering instant support and resolving queries in real time. Studies indicate that retailers using AI and ML have witnessed an increase in sales and a boost in profitability.\n\nOmnichannel retail becomes the new norm\n\nConsumers increasingly expect a seamless shopping journey across multiple channels, whether they\u2019re browsing online, visiting a physical store, or using a mobile app. As a result, retailers are doubling down on their omnichannel strategies to create a unified experience.\n\nKey initiatives include the implementation of Click and Collect services, real-time inventory visibility across platforms, and streamlined return processes. Retailers are also investing in mobile-friendly shopping platforms, ensuring customers can switch between devices without losing progress in their shopping journeys.\n\n\n\nA notable example is the integration of social media with e-commerce platforms. Through social commerce, brands are allowing consumers to shop directly through platforms like Instagram and TikTok, blurring the line between social engagement and online retail.\n\nSustainability takes centre stage\n\nEnvironmental consciousness has become a deciding factor for today\u2019s consumers, prompting retailers to prioritise sustainability. From product sourcing to packaging, every aspect of retail operations is being scrutinised for its environmental impact.\n\nMajor players in the UK market, including grocery giants and fashion retailers, are stepping up their efforts to reduce carbon footprints. Initiatives such as switching to biodegradable packaging, committing to zero waste, and promoting circular fashion through resale or rental services are becoming increasingly common.\n\nRetailers that emphasise transparency in their supply chains and communicate their sustainability goals effectively are finding favour with environmentally conscious shoppers. This trend is not only shaping buying behaviour but also fostering brand loyalty among a growing segment of eco-minded consumers.\n\nAdvanced technologies streamline operations\n\nTechnological innovation continues to drive efficiencies in the retail sector. A prominent development in this regard is the gradual replacement of traditional barcodes with QR codes. Unlike barcodes, QR codes can store more information and offer consumers additional product details, enhancing the overall shopping experience.\n\nLeading UK supermarkets, including Tesco and Ocado, have already begun rolling out QR codes on select products, such as milk cartons. This move is part of a broader trend towards digitisation aimed at improving both back-end operations and front-end customer interaction.\n\nIn addition to QR codes, retailers are adopting in-store technologies such as smart shelves and automated checkout systems to enhance convenience. The ultimate goal is to reduce friction at various touchpoints, making shopping faster and more enjoyable for consumers.\n\nRising trend: responsible consumerism and the decline of \u2018haul culture\u2019\n\nThe introduction of \u2018haul culture,\u2019 popularised by social media, has led to increased consumption and, consequently, higher return rates. This phenomenon, driven by younger consumers eager to showcase their shopping hauls online, poses significant challenges for retailers in terms of logistics and sustainability.\n\nIn response, many brands are adopting strategies to curb excessive returns, including improved product descriptions, enhanced sizing tools, and augmented reality (AR) fitting solutions. Retailers are also working to educate consumers on the environmental impact of returns and promote thoughtful purchasing habits.\n\nAdditionally, there is a growing emphasis on responsible consumerism. Retailers are encouraging shoppers to make more sustainable choices by highlighting the longevity and ethical sourcing of products. This trend reflects a broader cultural shift towards mindful consumption and away from fast fashion and impulsive buying.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe retail landscape in 2025 is set for significant transformation as businesses adapt to technological advancements, sustainability pressures, and changing consumer behaviours. Retailers that successfully navigate these trends stand to benefit from increased customer loyalty, operational efficiencies, and long-term profitability.\n\nAs AI-driven personalisation, omnichannel experiences, and ethical practices become standard, the future of retail promises to be both exciting and dynamic. Brands that remain agile and responsive to these developments will not only survive but thrive in this evolving marketplace."

He just got a warning shot from an AI crack team in China that's ready to show that US technological supremacy is not a given.\n\nMeet DeepSeek, a Chinese startup spun off from a decade-old hedge fund that calculates shrewd trades with AI and algorithms. Its latest release, which came on Trump's inauguration day, has left much of America's top industry researchers stunned.\n\nIn a paper released Monday, DeepSeek unveiled a new flagship AI model called R1 that shows off a new level of \"reasoning.\" Why it has left such a huge impression on AI experts in the US matters.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 DeepSeek-R1 is here!\n\n\n\n\u26a1 Performance on par with OpenAI-o1\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 Fully open-source model & technical report\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 MIT licensed: Distill & commercialize freely!\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Website & API are live now!

It's an expensive, intensive process that demands a lot from the computing power buzzing underneath.\n\nAs a reminder, OpenAI fully released o1 \u2014 \"models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond\" \u2014 to a glowing reception in December after an initial release in September. DeepSeek's R1 shows just how quickly it can close the gap.\n\nDeepSeek narrows the gap\n\nWhat exactly does R1 do? For one, DeepSeek says R1 achieves \"performance comparable to OpenAI o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.\"\n\nIts research paper says this is possible thanks to \"pure reinforcement learning,\" a technique that Jim Fan, a senior research manager at Nvidia, said was reminiscent of the secret behind making Google DeepMind's AlphaZero a master at games such as go and chess from scratch, \"without imitating human grandmaster moves first.\" He wrote on X that this was \"the most significant takeaway from the paper.\"\n\nWe are living in a timeline where a non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive - truly open, frontier research that empowers all. It makes no sense. The most entertaining outcome is the most likely.\n\n\n\nDeepSeek-R1 not only open-sources a barrage of models but\u2026 pic.twitter.com/M7eZnEmCOY \u2014 Jim Fan (@DrJimFan) January 20, 2025\n\nDeepSeek, which launched in 2023, said in its paper that it did this because its goal was to explore the potential of AI to \"develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data.\" This is a common technique used by AI researchers. The company also said that an earlier version of R1 called R1-Zero gave them an \"aha moment\" in which the AI \"learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial approach.\"\n\nThe end result offers what the Wharton professor Ethan Mollick described as responses from R1 that read \"like a human thinking out loud.\"\n\nNotably, this level of transparency into the development of AI has been hard to come by in the notes published by companies such as OpenAI when releasing models of a similar aptitude.\n\nNathan Lambert, a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, said on Substack that R1's paper \"is a major transition point in the uncertainty in reasoning model research\" as \"until now, reasoning models have been a major area of industrial research without a clear seminal paper.\"\n\nStaying true to the open spirit, DeepSeek's R1 model, critically, has been fully open-sourced, having obtained an MIT license \u2014 the industry standard for software licensing.\n\nTogether, these elements of R1 provide complications to US players caught up in an AI arms race with China \u2014 Trump's main geopolitical rival \u2014 for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, it shows that China can rival some of the top AI models in the industry and keep pace with cutting-edge developments coming out of Silicon Valley.\n\nSecond, open-sourcing highly advanced AI could also challenge companies that are seeking to make huge profits by selling their technology.\n\nOpenAI, for instance, introduced a ChatGPT Pro plan in December that costs $200 a month. Its selling point was that it included \"unlimited access\" to its smartest model at the time, o1. If an open-source model offers similar capabilities for free, the incentive to buy a costly paid subscription could, in theory, diminish.\n\nNvidia's Fan described the situation like this on X: \"We are living in a timeline where a non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive \u2014 truly open, frontier research that empowers all.\"\n\nDeepSeek has shown off reasoning know-how before. In November, the company released an \"R1-lite-preview\" that showed its \"transparent thought process in real time.\" In December, it released a model called V3 to serve as a new, bigger foundation for future reasoning in models.\n\nIt's a big reason American researchers see a meaningful improvement in the latest model, R1.\n\nTheo Browne, a software developer behind a popular YouTube channel for the tech community, said that \"the new DeepSeek R1 model is incredible.\" Tanay Jaipuria, a partner investing in AI at Silicon Valley's Wing VC, also described it as \"incredible.\"\n\nDeepSeek R-1 is incredible.\n\n\n\n- OpenAI o-1 level reasoning at 1/25th the cost\n\n- Fully open source with MIT license\n\n- API outputs can be used for distillation pic.twitter.com/YjHbylNuH8 \u2014 Tanay Jaipuria (@tanayj) January 20, 2025\n\nAwni Hannun, a machine-learning researcher at Apple, said a key advantage of R1 was that it was less intensive, showing that the industry was \"getting close to open-source o1, at home, on consumer hardware,\" referring to OpenAI's reasoning model introduced last year.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe model can be \"distilled,\" meaning smaller but also powerful versions can run on hardware that's far less intensive than the computing power loaded into servers in data centers many tech companies depend on to run their AI models.\n\nHannun demonstrated this by sharing a clip on X of a 671 billion-parameter version of R1 running on two Apple M2 Ultra chips, responding with reason to a prompt asking whether a straight or a flush is better in a game of Texas Hold'em. Hannun said its response came \"faster than reading speed.\"\n\nAI censorship\n\nR1 does appear to have one key problem. The former OpenAI board member Helen Toner pointed out on X that there were demos of R1 \"shutting itself down when asked about topics the CCP doesn't like.\"\n\nToner did suggest, however, that \"the censorship is obviously being done by a layer on top, not the model itself.\" DeepSeek didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt is worth noting, of course, that OpenAI has introduced a new model called o3 that's meant to be a successor to the o1 model DeepSeek is rivaling. Lambert said in his blog post that OpenAI was \"likely technically ahead,\" but he added the key caveat that the o3 model was \"not generally available,\" nor would basic information such as its \"weights\" be available anytime soon.\n\nGiven DeepSeek's track record so far, don't be surprised if its next model shows parity to o3. America's tech leaders may have met their match in China."

There are more overall audits, and the audits are occurring with greater frequency.\n\nCritical enterprise software is continuously evolving. As software becomes more feature rich, support fees increase, and dependencies are built in that make already critical software more critical.\n\nThis survey shows the impact of the increased cost of software licenses on users as well as the intangible expenses related to ever-changing requirements attached to software usage. The survey found that the impact has been substantial\u2014specifically, in the most critical applications.\n\nSome significant examples include the new subscription approach of Oracle Java as 44% of respondents report that they have been impacted.\n\nBut that example is trivial when compared to the new AI-powered services offered by Microsoft which is impacting customers at a whopping 78%.\n\nAnd the newest, but perhaps greatest change in the market (based on the findings covered in this report) is presented by VMware by Broadcom whose customers report that they have been impacted at a rate of over 55%.\n\nMore than one-third of respondents report that their software audit took 3-6 months to resolve, 11% required six months to a year, and a few customers dedicated more than a year.\n\nThere is the cost to manage and complete the contractual requirement of the audit, which can include staff time, operational disruption, and delayed projects. Along with that, there is the resulting monetary obligation that needs to be satisfied based on what the audit determines the customer owes the software vendor for compliance issues.\n\nThe 2025 survey reveals that approximately 32% of the companies measured had to pay over $1 million in costs. Only 10% in 2023 reached that level of financial liability.\n\nTo read the full report, go here."

The United States already prohibits the import of virtually all Russian products, and Russia has faced a multitude of U.S. and European sanctions since the invasion began almost three years ago.\n\nIn a post to his Truth Social site on Wednesday, Trump urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to \u201csettle now and stop this ridiculous war.\u201d\n\nHe said he had no desire to hurt Russia \u2014 which he noted had played a major role in securing victory for the Allies against Nazi Germany in World War II \u2014 and has a good relationship with Putin, but warned of the penalties if the war isn\u2019t stopped soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t make a \u2018deal,\u2019 and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries.\u201d\n\nTrump has been skeptical of the billions of dollars the Biden administration provided Ukraine in weapons and other materiel to defend itself. He has often spoken of his desire to end the war and said on the campaign trail that he could end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office. That has not happened.\n\nThe problem with the threat is that other than a small amount of fertilizer, animal feed, inorganic material like tin, and machinery, Russia currently exports very little to the U.S. that could be subject to tariffs. Oil had been Russia\u2019s largest export to the U.S., but such trade was zeroed out in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. imported a total of $2.8 billion worth of these products from Russia in 2024, a tiny fraction of U.S. imports and a precipitous drop from 2023, when it was $4.5 billion, and 2022, when it was $14.4 billion, according to U.S. government statistics.\n\nAnd, Russia is already one of the world\u2019s most heavily sanctioned nations. Many of those sanctions relate to its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and were imposed under President Joe Biden, but others predate Biden. Some were imposed during Trump\u2019s first term in office, and some date back to Russia\u2019s 2014 seizure of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula."

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump issued Russian President Vladimir Putin an ultimatum on Wednesday \u2013 make a deal with me to end the Ukraine war or pay a hefty economic price.\n\nTrump said he'd put all manner of taxes, tariffs and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and vaguely threatened secondary punishment against countries who do business with Moscow.\n\n\"We can do it the easy way, or the hard way \u2013 and the easy way is always better,\" he said. \"It\u2019s time to MAKE A DEAL. NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!\"\n\nThe missive followed a warning from Trump the previous evening that sanctions against Russia were likely if Putin refused to enter into negotiations to end the war. Trump repeatedly pledged to quickly end the bloodshed when he was a candidate, claiming at various points that he'd do it as president-elect or within 24 hours of arriving at the White House.\n\nBut the conflict has proved harder to solve than Trump once thought \u2014 an issue he has blamed, in part, on constraints he faced in directly negotiating with Putin.\n\nTrump told reporters during a January press conference that Putin wanted to meet with him but he felt it would be improper while Joe Biden was still in office.\n\nThe Logan Act prevents private citizens from corresponding with foreign governments with the intent of undermining U.S. foreign policy. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden quit speaking to Putin. His administration adopted the stance that the U.S. would provide military assistance to Ukraine for as long it takes to drive out Russian troops, unless Kyiv decided it wanted to change course.\n\nTrump said Tuesday evening that Putin disrespected Biden and wouldn't be permitted to treat him that way. He said he'd spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and would be talking with Putin.\n\n\"President Zelenskyy would like to have peace. He's told me that very strongly. He'd like to have peace, but it takes two to tango,\" Trump told USA TODAY during an impromptu news conference.\n\nAs for when and where he'd meet with Putin, the president replied: \"Anytime they want.\"\n\nAnd if Putin did not agree to enter into negotiations, Trump said he was \"likely\" to put sanctions on Russia.\n\nWar in Ukraine:Putin draws a nuclear red line for the West\n\nRobert O\u2019Brien, who served as national security adviser during Trump's first term, said in an interview prior to the exchange that he believed the new administration would try to pressure Russia into cutting a deal by ratcheting up sanctions on the aggressor nation.\n\n\u201cI would expect President Trump to say, look, Vladimir Putin, if you don't come to the table and do so quickly, the sanctions are gonna be pretty significant and devastating,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\nO\u2019Brien said both sides would need to make concessions. But the former Trump national security adviser, who also served as as his special envoy for hostages affairs, did not believe the president was interested in a scenario where Putin would be able to rebuild his army and attack Ukraine in several years.\n\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, the U.S. president said he was not \"not looking to hurt Russia\" and emphasized that he \"always had a very good relationship\" with Putin prior to the start of the conflict. \"We must never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War, losing almost 60,000,000 lives in the process.\"\n\nThe Russian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump sidesteps questions about how ceasefire would work\n\nMultiple times as a candidate, Trump declared that he could end the war in one day, going so far at a September debate as to claim he\u2019d get it done during the presidential transition. He backed off that timeline as the inauguration drew closer, vowing instead to have the war wrapped up within the next six months.\n\n\u201cThat's a tough one, much tougher than it would have been before it started, I can tell you that,\u201d Trump told reporters at a Jan. 7 news conference at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cA deal could have been made just by an average dealmaker. A deal could have been made on that,\u201d he added.\n\nLast month Trump called for an immediate ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine after a meeting with Zelenskyy. But he has not said how one would work or how he plans to resolve the war. He has also declined to say whether he\u2019d continue to provide weapons to Ukraine and sympathized with Russia over its concerns about Ukraine\u2019s bid to join NATO.\n\nHe told reporters on Tuesday evening that he believes the European Union should be sending more money to Ukraine than the United States does.\n\n\"I mean, what are we stupid? I guess the answer is yes,\" he said, answering his own rhetorical question.\n\nAn 'excellent call':Trump, Zelenskyy speak for first time after election with Ukraine's future in doubt\n\nThe European Union says it has spent $145 billion since the start of the war on financial, military, humanitarian and refugee assistance to Ukraine. It has also committed to providing $20 billion in loans. The U.S. government has appropriated $175 billion to Ukraine since the beginning of the war, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAdvisers to Trump have talked at various points about freezing the war along the current battle lines during talks, delaying NATO membership for Kyiv for a period of 10 to 20 years in exchange for substantial military assistance and the withdrawal of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine, and the establishment of a demilitarized zone that would be patrolled by European peacekeepers to enforce an agreement.\n\nNearly three years after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow occupies just under 20% of Ukraine's territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nUkraine has managed to take back some of its occupied territory, but its efforts to mount a counteroffensive have largely stalled as Russia has surged weapons and soldiers to Ukraine's northeast Kharkiv region with support from North Korean troops.\n\nRussia has meanwhile continued to bombard Ukrainian cities with missile and drone attacks, and it is trying to blockade its ports. Ukraine has stepped up drone attacks on Russian ships and infrastructure and also fired at targets inside Russia using long-range missiles supplied by the U.S. and European countries.\n\nNew administration looks for a negotiated end to the war\n\nAt a hearing last week, Trump secretary of state nominee Marco Rubio, who was later confirmed to the role, signaled it would be the official position of the administration that the Ukraine-Russia war be brought to an end.\n\nHe said sending unlimited aid to Ukraine for as long as it wants to keep fighting is not a realistic position and both countries would have to make concessions.\n\n\u201cNow what that master plan looks like is going to be hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cMy hope is that it can begin with some ceasefire.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration rushed to unload aid to Ukraine during the transition amid concerns that Trump would use military assistance as a bargaining chip. A Biden administration official told USA TODAY in January that the U.S. had exhausted all the funding that Congress previously appropriated.\n\nTrump pushes for end to the conflict:Donald Trump calls for 'immediate' ceasefire in Russia-Ukraine war after meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nIn an interview before the inauguration, Rep. Michael McCaul, who was chairman of the House Foreign Affairs committee until early January, said he did not know whether Trump would ask Congress for additional money.\n\n\u201cI'm hoping that Trump sees who Putin really is, you know, in this process, and he's not a good faith partner. He's not a good faith negotiator,\u201d said McCaul, a leading proponent of Ukraine aid in Congress.\n\nTrump said at a news conference in early January that Putin sought to meet with him during the transition, but he did not think it would be appropriate to take the Russian leader up on the offer until after he had taken office.\n\n\"He can't be thrilled, he's not doing so well. I mean, he's grinding it out, but most people thought that war would've been over in about one week and now you're into three years,\" Trump told reporters assembled in the Oval Office on Monday evening, hours after he was sworn in to his second term. \"So he can't be thrilled, it's not making him look very good.\"\n\nPreparations for a meeting are underway, Trump national security adviser Michael Waltz told ABC News earlier this month.\n\n\u201cFrom President Trump's perspective, you can't enter a deal if you don't have some type of relationship and dialog with the other side,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will absolutely establish that in the coming months.\u201d\n\nIt is not entirely clear how soon the leaders plan to meet or where they would even do so. The leaders met in Helsinki the first time Trump was in office. Finland has since joined NATO and sided with Ukraine in the war.\n\nA source familiar with the discussions that are taking place said Trump\u2019s special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, was likely to meet with Putin's government first.\n\nBefore sanctions and other measures are put in place there has to be dialog, the person said, and so far, Kellogg's conversations have been limited to Ukraine and the Europeans.\n\nKellogg postponed a trip he planned to make to Kyiv until after the inauguration. He did not respond to a request for comment but told Fox News during an interview in early January that he had a personal goal of wrapping the war up in 100 days.\n\nZelenskyy has said he planned to meet with Trump after the inauguration although it was not clear when. The pair have been in regular communication over the last few months, speaking by phone after the election and meeting in September on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Zelenskyy and Trump held talks in December while they were in Paris.\n\nIn an interview published in January with podcaster Lex Fridman, the Ukrainian president said it is \u201cnaive\u201d to think that Putin wants to finish the war and Trump would have to pressure him to stop it. Zelenskyy said that he struck a ceasefire agreement with Putin in 2019 that Russia eventually violated after ignoring his phone calls.\n\nTrump will be in the same situation as he was, Zelenskyy said, unless the U.S. offers serious security guarantees to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cToday (Putin is) afraid of Trump. But once Trump manages, for example, to do a ceasefire deal without serious security guarantees for Ukraine, he will give a pass to Putin,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cHe does not want that. I believe in what he says. But he will give Putin an opportunity, because in Putin\u2019s head, he wants me to fight with Trump.\u201d\n\n'Dictators do not go on vacation':Zelenskyy takes an apparent dig at Congress over military aid\n\nAt a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, in what appeared to be Zelenskyy's first public remarks about Trump since the U.S. leader returned to office, the Ukrainian president questioned whether Trump was committed to NATO and European security more generally.\n\n\"Will President Trump even notice Europe? Does he see NATO as necessary? And will he respect EU institutions?\" Zelenskyy asked an audience of leaders and global opinion shapers.\n\nHe didn't attempt to answer his own question.\n\nPutin is demanding that Ukraine be prohibited from ever joining NATO and continues to demand that Ukraine withdraw from territory that it has annexed, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst said.\n\n\u201cWhat Trump has put out there, while I think it's not wonderful, it's also not a disaster if European troops are willing to serve in between the two forces to enforce peace. That's pretty close to a security guarantee,\u201d said Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\n\nHerbst said he believes the Europeans can be persuaded into such an agreement if they are offered their own security guarantees from the United States.\n\n\u201cI think Trump does not want to think about this right now, but if this became essential to get the deal, he may and that is: if the Russians start shooting at the Europeans, and Europeans shoot back, the Americans are also shooting back.\u201d\n\nO'Brien, the former Trump national security adviser, said, \u201cYou\u2019d have security guarantees that are more than a scrap of paper and less than full NATO membership.\"\n\nThose could include having British and European forces on the ground. \u201cThere are significant security guarantees to get the Ukrainians what they need and protects Ukraine that are short of NATO membership. I don\u2019t think NATO membership is the magic wand here for Ukraine,\" O'Brien said.\n\nA senior European defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue where there appears to be some division among allies about Trump's ideas for Ukraine, said there is no scenario where a Russia-Ukraine peace deal where the latter is forced to give up territory represents \"the best solution to the war.\"\n\nThe official said western allies should \"never approve\" an agreement that sees Ukraine cede its territory to Russia, that Putin needs to be held accountable for war crimes committed in Ukraine and also pay financial reparations for damages and losses to Ukrainian infrastructure sustained during the war.\n\n\"The only good and long-term sustainable solution is a full victory for Ukraine,\" the official said. The official added that if Trump's peace plan means the conflict is \"frozen\" \u2212 armed conflict is brought to an end, but there's no peace treaty or other resolving political framework \u2212 it would simply allow Russia's military to regroup and relocate, including closer to other parts of Europe where more countries would be threatened.\n\nThe official added that the most important issue for Ukraine now is how to get it in the strongest possible position vis-a-vis Russia and to compel Putin to negotiate.\n\n\"This is the most critical part,\" the official said, \"and it is still unsolved.\""

            "article_content": "\u20b9\n\n\u20b9\n\nShares of Cables and Wires manufacturer Polycab India Ltd. opened with gains of up to 4% on Thursday, January 23, after multiple brokerages reiterated their positive outlook on the stock post its December quarter results.Despite Polycab's rough start to 2025, with the stock down 15% year-to-date, majority of the Street continues to remain bullish on the stock. Over 65% of the 32 analysts that have coverage on the company have a 'Buy' recommendation on the counter, while seven of them have a 'Hold' rating and four say 'Sell'.Consensus price targets on Polycab suggest a further upside of another 27.5% on the stock from Wednesday's closing levels. Among analysts, Jefferies currently has a price target of \u20b99,200 on Polycab, which is the highest on the Street, implying a potential upside of 50% from Wednesday's close.Brokerage firm Jefferies, which also has a 'Buy' rating on the stock, said that Polycab reported strong Q3 results with consolidated sales and EBITDA growing over 20% and 26% year-on-year, respectively.While cables demand was healthy in Q3, wires slackened due to softening of copper price and high channel inventory at start of Q3.Operating profit margins (OPM) rose to 13.8% (+70 basis points year-on-year, +230 basis points quarter-on-quarter), driven by margin normalisation in Cables & Wires (C&W) and reduced losses in the FMEG segment.Other non-operating income declined by 65% year-on-year, leading to lower profit growth of 11% year-on-year, broadly in line with Jefferies' estimates.The management has provided healthy guidance for next five years:- Capex to range between \u20b96,000 crore to \u20b98,000 crore- Wires and cables margin to be between 11% to 13%- FMEG EBITDA to be between 8% and 10%- Dividend payout to be over 30%- Exports to contribute more than 10% of the total businessUBS too has a 'Buy' rating on Polycab, with a price target of9,000 per share. The brokerage said that the cable and wire topline growth of 12% drove miss on topline. This was led by slowing government capex and should recover with rebound in government capex.FMEG segment saw sequential reduction in loss (PBIT margins at 3% as against 6.4% in Q2).Citi has maintained a 'Buy' rating on Polycab, with a price target of \u20b98,600, naming it their top pick.Revenue grew 20% on-year, slightly missing Citi's estimate by 2%, but EBITDA rose 26% on-year, surpassing estimates by 15%. The strong EBITDA performance was driven by better-than-expected margins in the Wires & Cables segment and reduced losses in the FMEG business.Wires & Cables margins improved 119bps QoQ (-56bps YoY) to 13.5%, supported by-- Margin normalisation in wires, and- Increased contributions from international business, which rose to 8.3% (compared to 6.2% in Q3FY24 and 6.1% in Q2FY25).- Management expects export momentum to continue into Q4FY25.Another brokerage house Macquarie has an 'Outperform' rating on Polycab, with a price target of7,928 per share.Their strategic outlook implies 15% revenue CAGR for FY25-30. Polycab reported Q3 revenue of \u20b95,200 crore (+20% YoY) and EBITDA of \u20b9720 crore (+26% YoY), both in line with estimates.Key positive surprise, as per the brokerage, was better than expected C&W segment margins, which expanded 120bps QoQ (down 50bps YoY) to 13.5%, driven by better margins in wires and higher share of export revenue QoQ. Profit grew 11% on-year.Shares of Polycab are currently trading 1.27% higher on Thursday at \u20b96,242.60. This stock has gained over 50% in the last one year."

            "article_content": "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are needed for businesses to have good control over key processes such as accounting, supply chain, manufacturing, HR and many more. In recent years, however, with the advent of cloud computing, businesses now have a choice to deploy ERP solutions on-premise or in the cloud.\n\nCloud and on-premise ERPs have vastly different integration capabilities and methods. In order to decide which integration approach would be better for a business, you need to consider factors like cost, scalability, data security and customizability.\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive comparison between cloud and on-premise ERP integrations across critical factors that technology decision-makers must consider before selecting an integration approach. It also offers advice on determining if your business is better suited for the cloud or on-premise ERP ecosystem based on your operating model, growth objectives and enterprise architecture.\n\nCloud ERP Integration Overview\n\nERP solutions for the cloud from ERP software development services can be hosted on vendor or third-party servers and accessed through the Internet. With this deployment model, businesses don\u2019t have to invest in on-premise hardware and ERP infrastructure.\n\nCloud ERP systems such as Oracle NetSuite, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, and Infor CloudSuite are more commonly built using modern API-led connectivity protocols rather than traditional on-premise approaches like batch data transfers or point-to-point integration.\n\nKey integration capabilities with cloud ERP deployments include:\n\nReal-time data sync between cloud ERP and other SaaS apps via APIs\n\nSimple app integration through cloud ERP marketplaces\n\nPrebuilt connectors to popular SaaS platforms like ecommerce, payments, marketing automation etc\n\nEDI and supply chain integration through cloud B2B networks\n\nIntegration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) for interfacing legacy on-premise systems\n\nAgility and Speed\n\nThe API-led architecture of cloud ERP systems integration accelerates the implementation of new apps and workflows to keep pace with business priorities. IT can build integrations in days/weeks rather than months with on-premise ERPs.\n\nLower TCO\n\nWith cloud ERP system integration, there is no need for upfront capital expenditure on integration software, hardware and middleware. Businesses only pay for used capacity as an operating expense.\n\nScalability\n\nYou can easily scale prebuilt and custom integrations to handle higher transaction loads as your ERP data integration volume grows without disruption. Usage-based pricing allows paying for only additional capacity.\n\nEnhanced Data Security\n\nCloud ERP vendors spend a lot of money on advanced security controls like encryption, tokenization, role-based access etc., and the integrations built using these systems also come with the same security capabilities.\n\nInnovation Velocity\n\nCloud ERP platforms are often updated, so their integration capabilities utilize the latest technologies, such as AI/ML, blockchain, advanced analytics, etc. On-premise systems do not provide these latest integration features.\n\nKey Challenges with Cloud ERP Integration\n\nWhile cloud ERP integrations accelerate digitization, some downsides need consideration:\n\nVendor dependence risk\n\nBusinesses become technologically wedded to the cloud ERP vendor. Migrating large data volumes across systems is challenging if the provider relationship turns sour later.\n\nCustomization constraints\n\nAlthough configuration is possible, custom-coding cloud ERPs like SAP S/4HANA Cloud are restricted. It limits bespoke modification of prebuilt integrations.\n\nIntegration costs add up\n\nWhile cloud ERP software integration needs lower initial investment, custom development and licensing connector apps in the marketplace incur ongoing costs.\n\nIntegration testing limitations\n\nCloud ERP vendors don\u2019t always fully simulate live production scenarios during integration ERP system testing, which can hinder the anticipation of post-go-live issues.\n\nCloud vendor technical support\n\nWhile some cloud ERP vendors provide prompt, expert technical support for complex integration issues and niche troubleshooting that requires troubleshooting skills, others don\u2019t.\n\nOn-Premise ERP Integration Overview\n\nSAP ECC, Oracle E-Business Suite, and Infor LN are ERP software installed on on-premises servers in the company system. The administration of the ERP platform and databases and the management of upgrades, security patches, and fixes are all the responsibilities of the IT team.\n\nLegacy B2B protocols like EDI and point-to-point middleware have historically dominated integration architectures for on-premise ERP deployments. However, modern integration tools like Boomi, MuleSoft and Microsoft BizTalk now empower API-based connectivity even with on-premise ERPs.\n\nHere are some of the prominent ERP integration methods with on-premise ERP platforms:\n\nEDI for B2B data interchange with supply chain partners\n\nPoint-to-point integration using middleware\n\nAPI connectivity to/from ERP using an integration platform (iPaaS)\n\nBatch data integration for periodic large data transfers\n\nOn-premise or hosted integration platform installations\n\nChange data capture for detecting and propagating updates\n\nEnterprise service buses (ESB) for routing integration traffic\n\nProcess integration with business process management (BPM) tools\n\nWhile cloud integration delivers agility, on-premise ERP integration brings other strategic advantages:\n\nCustomization Freedom\n\nOn-premise ERPs allow modifications to source code to enhance and tailor prebuilt integrations. They offer greater flexibility than cloud ERPs.\n\nBetter Legacy Connectivity\n\nOn-premise ERP software integration tools have well-established legacy protocol adapters that seamlessly interface with outdated systems. Thus, it is easier to retain legacy compatibility while upgrading an integrated ERP system.\n\nContinuity During Outages\n\nIntegration processes are minimally disrupted when the internet goes down as servers are inside the corporate firewall. The problem is that if externally hosted systems become unavailable, cloud integration workflows stop.\n\nStricter Data Security\n\nDirect control over servers without surrendering them to cloud vendors for stringent compliance and security reasons are some highly regulated industries such as defense and banking, etc.\n\nSuperior Support Mechanisms\n\nOn-premise ERP platforms allow easier leveraging of internal IT talent and external system integrators for technical support during complex integration issues. Resolution times are faster.\n\nKey Challenges with On-Premise ERP Integration\n\nHowever, businesses pay a steep price for the wide-ranging control and customizability delivered by on-premise ERP integration in certain areas:\n\nInflexible and slow\n\nDiplomatic protocols and point-to-point links between on-premise ERP and surrounding systems make agile integration challenging. Responding to changing needs involves prolonged development and testing cycles.\n\nSubstantial hardware demands\n\nMaintaining high-performance infrastructure for integration middleware, databases, backup systems etc., drives up capital expenditure costs with on-premise ERP integration.\n\nScaling limitations\n\nPhysical capacity in the on-premise data center constricts the addition of integration infrastructure to handle higher transaction volumes during business growth.\n\nVendor dependence\n\nWhile customization is possible, skilled resources for legacy ERP platforms like SAP ECC are dwindling. This compels businesses to pay premiums for vendor consulting.\n\nWaning innovation\n\nVendors are focused on developing their cloud ERP offerings. As a result, fewer cutting-edge features reach on-premise product versions through upgrades, causing integration capabilities to lag.\n\nMaking the Right Choice: Cloud vs On-Premise ERP Integration\n\nWhile both cloud and on-premise ERP integration models have trade-offs, the right choice depends on your business priorities and IT landscape:\n\nTransaction volume \u2013 High-volume integration needs may require on-premise for optimal performance\n\nHigh-volume integration needs may require on-premise for optimal performance Budget \u2013 Cloud integration with pay-per-usage may suit mid-market firms reluctant to large upfront investment\n\nCloud integration with pay-per-usage may suit mid-market firms reluctant to large upfront investment Agility needs \u2013 Frequently changing integration needs favor cloud ERPs for swift reconfiguration\n\nFrequently changing integration needs favor cloud ERPs for swift reconfiguration Compliance needs \u2013 Heavily regulated industries may prefer on-premise for localized security control\n\nHeavily regulated industries may prefer on-premise for localized security control Legacy landscape \u2013 Lots of outdated surround systems prefer on-premise integration with better legacy bridges\n\nLots of outdated surround systems prefer on-premise integration with better legacy bridges Innovation culture \u2013 Businesses that reward innovation gravitate towards cloud ERP\u2019s latest integration features\n\nBusinesses that reward innovation gravitate towards cloud ERP\u2019s latest integration features Application landscape \u2013 A predominantly cloud-based application portfolio suits cloud ERP integration, while on-premise apps align with on-premise ERP integrations\n\nIn addition, if an organization has a long-term hybrid enterprise architecture strategy, it can use both cloud and on-premise integration models at the same time.\n\nFor example, you can keep legacy on-premise ERP integration and cloud ERP integration with new SaaS capabilities. It allows you to pivot from existing systems to becoming cloud native at a sensible pace, keeping the critical operations running.\n\nThe bimodal integration architecture will align business IT objectives in terms of agility, innovation and risk mitigation.\n\nConclusion\n\nCloud ERP integration addresses serious challenges like inflexibility, upgrade headaches, and high total cost of ownership of legacy on-premise ERP platforms, albeit with its limitations: vendor dependency and customization constraints.\n\nWhile cloud ERP integration has compelling advantages for most modernizing enterprises, it deserves a careful analysis of your integration needs, IT ecosystem, business priorities and target operating model before you leap.\n\nAs cloud ERP adoption picks up sharply through 2025, the selection of integration technology now represents a watershed moment for the right digital transformation and innovation cadence.\n\nAfter methodically weighing the pros and cons of available integration approaches, choose wisely when to go with one, and then avoid modernization journeys that are completely misaligned and can seriously impede what you are trying to achieve with modernization."

At an incredible 7.5 to 7.9 kilometers per second, they outstrip any hurricane or jetstream known to science.\n\nHere on Earth, the fastest puff of wind on record was a blustery 407 kilometers (253 miles) per hour, measured on Australia's Barrow Island in 1996. Neptune has the highest wind speeds in our Solar System, but even its 1,770 kilometer-per-hour high-altitude currents feel more like a mild breeze by comparison.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nWASP-127b is a wispy puffball of a world, slightly larger than Jupiter yet with just 16 percent of Jupiter's mass.\n\nIt's also believed to be tidally locked, rotating in step with every 4.2-Earth-day lap around its star, so one side is perpetually baked to temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius (1832 degrees Fahrenheit), and the other never turns from the cold night sky.\n\nDiscovered in 2016, the world has been the focus of intense investigation, resulting in some of the most precise measurements of an exoplanet's atmosphere to date.\n\nNortmann and her team used an instrument called a cryogenic high-resolution infrared echelle spectrograph on the European Space Agency's Very Large Telescope located in Chile's Atacama Desert to measure the composition of WASP-127b's gases.\n\nA closer inspection of the signals revealed two clear peaks \u2013 one indicating the material was approaching the observers quickly, the other moving away just as fast.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nVariations in the strength of the signals between the planet's poles may indicate extreme temperature variations of potentially hundreds of degrees Celsius between dusk and dawn, making WASP-127b a world of hellish extremes and yet not entirely unfamiliar.\n\n\"This shows that the planet has complex weather patterns just like Earth and other planets of our own system,\" says author Fei Yan, an astronomer with the University of Science and Technology of China.\n\nCast adrift in this flow, a space tourist would circle the giant planet in hours, basking in the radiation of a Sun-like star that fills its sky.\n\nIn addition to the surprise discovery of WASP-127b's incredible winds, the team detected expected levels of carbon monoxide where none had been seen before, canceling any need for exotic theories of planetary formation.\n\nThis hot cotton ball is far from alone as far as low-density planets go, representing a strange category of gas giants that could contribute to our knowledge of how planetary systems emerge from their swirling nebulae.\n\nHaving a clear measure of the air currents churning up material on extreme worlds such as this can inform models describing how planets form, grow, and evolve, potentially helping us better understand the history and fate of planets within our own Solar System.\n\nThis research was published in Astronomy & Astrophysics."

LAPRESSE\n\nIn a series of perplexing events, multiple UFO sightings have been reported and recorded over several days across California, particularly in the Fresno area. These sightings have sparked a wave of curiosity and concern, as both residents and authorities are left pondering the origins of these unidentified flying objects.\n\nThe string of sightings began with a mysterious light hovering over downtown Fresno in the early hours, just past 4 a.m. Local news station Fox 26 captured the first sighting on camera, showing a light that appeared to move swiftly before coming to a stationary hover. Earl Grey Anderson, a field investigator for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), reviewed the footage and classified it as an unidentified flying object.\n\nTaylor Swift's Heartfelt Message to Swifties\n\nThe following day, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara documented another UFO sighting, this time in the daylight. The footage added to the mounting intrigue surrounding these mysterious occurrences. A few days later, a private pilot reported seeing a white object trailing his aircraft at an altitude of 3,500 feet over downtown Fresno. Despite radioing the local airport tower for assistance, the pilot lost sight of the object shortly after.\n\nStill concern over what happened\n\nSeveral Fresno residents have also come forward with similar reports, describing their encounters with the unidentified objects. The recent sightings have reignited public fascination with UFOs, particularly as the Pentagon continues to release declassified information about aerial phenomena.\n\nWhile some speculate about extraterrestrial origins, others consider the possibility of advanced human-made technology or natural phenomena. Authorities are urging residents to remain calm as investigations continue.\n\nDespite the ongoing mystery, the sightings have undoubtedly captured the imaginations of those who witness these unexplained objects in the California skies. As the story develops, residents and authorities alike remain vigilant, hoping to uncover the truth behind these enigmatic appearances."

The display at the National Gallery in London will be the first major exhibition of candlelight paintings created by 18th Century painter Joseph Wright, known as Joseph Wright of Derby. Derby Museums Trust will lend a number of pieces to be used in the event, which begins in November. Tony Butler, executive director of the trust, said: \"We're very excited his work will be showcased in this way.\"\n\nDerby Museums Trust Joseph Wright of Derby was known for showcasing the industrial and scientific revolution in his paintings\n\nWright, who is viewed as a painter who ushered in the industrial and scientific revolution in the 18th century, was one of the first people to portray industry through art work alongside traditional landscapes and portraits The National Gallery said the exhibition will challenge the traditionally-held view the painter was solely a figurehead of the Enlightenment and \"looks beyond his position as the painter of light\". With more than 20 works, including other paintings, mezzotints, works on paper and objects, the exhibition explores both Wright's \"artistic practice and the historic context of scientific and artistic development in which they were made\". Tony Butler, from Derby Museums Trust, has been working behind the scenes to help facilitate the move of 17 paintings that will head to London later this year.\n\nTony Butler from Derby Museums Trust said it will be working to get the pieces ready for the November exhibition\n\n\"He is Derby's most famous artistic son - he is a major 18th century painter and should be seen as one of the most prominent figures in British art history,\" he said. \"We've been working with the National Gallery on this exhibition for the past 18 months and it's going to take a different look at Wright's work. \"He's often seen as a painter of light and this takes a slightly nuanced view of somebody who used shadow and darkness. \"A lot of the work we'll be doing will be getting the pieces ready, refine the storyline for the exhibition and give them a final check over before we send them down.\"\n\nDerby Museums Trust Wright's 1766 painting the 'Orrery' is considered a masterpiece\n\nWright of Derby: From the Shadows exhibition will begin on 7 November 2025 and conclude on 10 May 2026. It will take place in the Sunley Room at the National Gallery.\n\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
