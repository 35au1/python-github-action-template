Discover SCENE\n\nU.S. Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ), who posted to his X (formerly known as Twitter) account Friday a video he took of swarms of mysterious drones that have been spotted nightly during the past few weeks, said he was increasingly concerned about the unexplained phenomenon.\n\nKim, who joined local police in rural Clinton Township, New Jersey, 36 miles north of Trenton, said he spotted small clusters of two to four drones a number of times throughout the evening.\n\n\u201cWe often saw about 5-7 lights at a time that were low and not associated with aircraft we could see on the tracker app,\u201d Kim said, noting that the group used a flight tracker app to distinguish the drones from airplanes. \u201cSome hovered while others moved across the horizon.\u201d\n\nLast night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here\u2019s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDn \u2014 Andy Kim (@AndyKimNJ) December 13, 2024\n\nKim said police have tried to get close to the drones using helicopters, but when approached, the drones would turn off their lights and go dark, echoing a statement by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis has gone on for weeks,\u201d Kim wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren\u2019t able to track these devices to determine origin, and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and countermeasures.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, eyewitnesses are pushing back against government claims that the drones pose no threat to communities or infrastructure. The growing story has spread to New York, Maryland, and Connecticut, where officials are demanding answers, while new reports of \u201ccar-sized\u201d UFOs were registered in California and parts of Europe.\n\n\u201cWhy is no one talking about the incident that caused an evac helicopter to not be able to pick up a patient due to these drones being in the way of where the helicopter had to go, and made the helicopter turn around and not be able to get the patient?\u201d New Jersey resident Roseann Stanley said on X. \u201cYet they are saying these drones have not caused any problems. That is a huge problem.\u201d\n\nOn November 26, a medical helicopter heading to an accident in Branchburg Township in Somerset County was unable to pick up an injured patient due to drones hovering near the landing zone, according to a report by New Jersey media outlet NJ.com.\n\nHundreds of drones were first spotted in mid-November flying over New Jersey; eyewitnesses have reported seeing convoys of drones almost every night since then and have described the crafts, in some cases, as being as big as the hood of a car, and performing in more sophisticated ways than off-the-shelf, consumer-oriented drones.\n\nThough the mysterious objects have been reported in the vicinity of a number of New Jersey-based military installations, with speculation about their provenance ranging from aliens from outer space to Iranian spycraft, Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Wednesday that no government facilities have been threatened by the drones.\n\nWhite House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said during a press conference on Thursday that \u201cwhile there is no known malicious activity occurring, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight a gap in authorities.\u201d\n\nKirby argued for new legislation that will better \u201cidentify and mitigate any potential threats to airports or other critical infrastructure, and so that state and local authorities are provided all the tools that they need to respond to such threats as well.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, many people believe the whole thing is much ado about nothing, and probably a stunt of some kind.\n\n\u201cI think these are just normal drones,\u201d Joseph Steinberg, a local resident, told Decrypt. \u201cMy daughter saw a large one, I went outside with her and we looked, but it was hard to judge the size.\u201d\n\n\"The first problem in situations like this is that beyond the initial drone sightings, you quickly get an overwhelming number of reports of things that aren\u2019t drones,\" Grant Jordan, the CEO of San Diego-based drone detection software company SkySafe, told Decrypt. \"When I look at these videos, the vast majority\u201499 out of 100\u2014aren't drones. They're aircraft, helicopters, satellites.\"\n\nAs Jordan explained, the flood of recent drone reports in New Jersey reveals two issues. First, people rarely observe the night sky, and mistake normal air traffic\u2014flashing lights, moving objects\u2014for something unusual. Second, judging the size and distance in the sky is difficult.\n\nWhile Jordan did not attribute these ongoing sightings to a growing hysteria, he did caution that copycats are likely at work, trying to capitalize on the public\u2019s fear and interest.\n\n\"When a story like this gets attention, it draws more people in\u2014some flying drones to look for others, and some just flying them to mess with people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are now seeing these drones in San Diego and the videos that were shown, it's just standard air traffic going into the San Diego Airport.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nWhistleblowers have claimed there is a secret Pentagon UFO data retrieval program codenamed Immaculate Constellation. The program supposedly is used to \u201cdetect\u201d and \u201cquarantine\u201d the military\u2019s best UFO imagery, videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis program has supposedly been hidden from Congressional oversight since 2017, the whistleblowers claim. Immaculate Constellation is what is known, according to a government source, as an \u201cUnacknowledged Special Access Program,\u201d or USAP.\n\nNaturally, a Pentagon spokesperson denied the existence of the program. Really though, what else could they have said about a government program that the whistleblowers claim is \u201cabove top secret?\u201d\n\nThis week, more fuel was added to the conspiratorial fire when an email containing UFO images allegedly from the U.S. military were leaked online by an anonymous source.\n\nAccording to DailyMail.com\u2026\n\nThe black-and-white images show ornately spiked \u2018cruciform\u2019 UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating \u2018hot\u2019 cube, traditional flying saucers and several other craft that look straight out of classic science fiction. The screengrabs are said to be from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by military \u2018heads up displays,\u2019 but details were redacted to protect both sensitive US national security interests.\n\n\u201cThis person has asked me to redact their email address, although I can tell you that there is nothing identifiable in it,\u201d said Nathan Latvaitis of the YouTube channel Strange Mysteries, which has almost two million subscribers and is where the images were first made public.\n\n\u201cThe UAPs [Unidentified Aerial Phenomena] observed demonstrate capabilities far beyond conventional aerospace benchmarks,\u201d the whistleblower wrote about the photographs that were allegedly taken at sensitive military locations.\n\n\u201cShape-shifting has been observed \u2014 possibly due to advanced cloaking or optical refraction \u2014 referred to as \u2018morphogenic behavior,\u2019 allowing for adaptation to environments or missions,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also addressed those who doubt the images authenticity.\n\n\u201cMany traditional media outlets would require verification of my identity and credentials,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is not feasible due to the risks involved. [Those news media] organizations, despite their best intentions, are not equipped to handle the level of secrecy and potential retaliation associated with this information.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was part of one of the legacy programs,\u201d he continued. \u201cI know that\u2019s vague, but unfortunately that\u2019s all I can offer at this point.\u201d\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger, founder of the website Public, was one of the witnesses to testify before Congress in November. He said in his testimony that the Immaculate Constellation program has thousands of images of UFOs.\n\n\u201cWhat the American people need to know is that the U.S., military and intelligence community are sitting on a huge amount of visual and other information: still photos, video, photos, other sensor information, and they have for a very long time,\u201d Shellenberger said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not those fuzzy photos and videos that we\u2019ve been given. There\u2019s very clear, high resolution [images].\u201d"

While some believe the objects could be Iranian drones sent to spy on Americans, the truth might be far less thrilling.\n\nAccording to a post shared on X, the unidentified objects are most likely just one object, a drone developed by PteroDynamics. The XP-4 is one of the company\u2019s latest technological developments, and it\u2019s being developed for the U.S. Navy as a logistics and recon drone.\n\nThis matches the videos I've seen and certainly helps explain the government's odd response. pic.twitter.com/RiOVhspWEY \u2014 Samuel Hammond \ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udfdb (@hamandcheese) December 13, 2024\n\nPart of the confusion surrounding New Jersey\u2019s mysterious UFO reports, though, is the response from the U.S. government, which has continued to say that they aren\u2019t sure who the flying objects belong to. Based on the news shared on X, though, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at all.\n\nHowever, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that the U.S. government has been secretive about something like this. In fact, the government continues to hold the specifics of the various missions that its secret space plane are conducting close to the chest. And, since the XP-4 is a drone designed for the U.S. military, it makes sense it wouldn\u2019t want to talk about it too openly if it were behind sightings of New Jersey\u2019s mysterious UFOs.\n\nTech.

Some will likely still continue to hold that New Jersey\u2019s mysterious UFOs are drones spying for other countries. What makes the PteroDynamics angle so believable, though, is the fact that the drone is the same size as what has been reported.\n\nAdditionally, the XP-4\u2019s flight path matches with the reported sightings that have been coming in over the past several weeks in New Jersey. All of that tied together with the U.S. governments reluctance to say exactly who the drones belong to could very well point to this being the truth."

            "article_content": "Two weeks ago, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a public hearing to take sworn testimonies from witnesses who, from inside their positions in the U.S. intelligence community and Defense Department declared in open session under penalties of perjury right there before God and you and me:\n\n1) The U.S. government has recovered since 1947 multiple nonhuman \"biologics\" from UFO crash sites and has long operated a secret reverse-engineering program to glean advanced technology from recovered UFO vessels. Since the 1960s, so have our adversaries.\n\n2) The U.S. Defense Department and intelligence agencies have created USAP (Unacknowledged Special Access Programs) that are stove piped and classified above Top Secret, circumventing the constitutionally mandated oversight of congress and in many cases, circumventing the president of the United States. These USAPs are funded by black budgets with no checks and balances.\n\nThis hearing and one held just a year ago with different, equally credible witnesses, reveal the remarkable extent to which discussions around UFOs \u2013 previously mostly the domain of conspiracy theorists and believers in aliens and little green men \u2013 have now penetrated the U.S. military chain of command and the corridors of Congress.\n\nThis is not Hollywood, nor a video game, or H.G. Wells, \"Star Trek\" or \"Star Wars,\" et al. This, and as more testimony is set to the record, has revealed the extent that your employees are driven to lie to you about UFOs over the past 80 years.\n\nAs the largest cohort to ever pass through the American population, baby boomers have witnessed as history some of the most incredible conspiracy theories ever birthed in the 20th century and beyond.\n\nI've probably followed, with varying interest, every one that pops up. I suspect you have followed your fair share as well. It's easy to go down conspiracy theory rabbit holes. It's not so easy to emerge with answers. I've been a grassy knoll shooter believer in the JFK assassination since 1963. Look where that got me.\n\nHowever, there is one conspiracy theory that has been and continues to be transformed into fact as time passes that coincides near perfectly with the baby boomer timeline, and is the mother of all conspiracy theories: UFOs are real and Roswell happened. Gen Z, who are our grandchildren, have created UFO memes on social media that are some of the most visited subjects of all time; followed by billions around the world. This subject has become transgenerational.\n\nIf you are up for it, I am going to take you down that rabbit hole where I have already reached the other side confident that power and money have controlled the narrative, and because of that, extinction-level global crises that could have been solved with advanced non-human technologies, have gone unresolved and in fact have geometrically compounded in severity in the ensuing decades.\n\nA preliminary admonition and forewarning: What I am about to say to you is not an attempt at humor, satire, or an insane rant on something I know nothing about. I am not in need of wearing a tinfoil hat, nor am I prone to being a zealot engaging in flights of fancy. However, that is a self-assessment and I leave it up to you to decide if I have gone off the rails.\n\nIf you know nothing else about me from columns over the years, you have to conclude that I am a true sponge for historical subject matter. I can't get enough and as information technology has advanced at a quantum rate, additional facts are available for consideration regarding many events that were narrowly reported at the time of occurrence. Declassification of government records and an account with the National Archives makes me the kid in the candy store.\n\nLast year when Congress passed and President Biden signed into law the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (PL 118-31), the massive bill which funds everything relating to the United States military, it also contained a provision requiring that by Oct. 20, 2024, each federal agency review, identify, and organize all UFO related records in its custody for disclosure to the public and transmission to the national archives.\n\nLast month the national archives, as required by law, released the first installment to the public, of all agency legacy records of the United States government relating to UFOs and the existence of alien non-human life.\n\nOn the day of release, I downloaded the nearly one terabyte of publicly unseen and virtually unknown reports, files, photos, letters, communications and all things UFO accumulated over the baby boomer decades. I cracked my knuckles, rolled up my sleeves, and dug in. Thank God for subfreezing normal November weather.\n\nRight out of the chute, what I read and saw was amazing. I also began to get pissed off as the sheer volume of credible and verifiable information that our government has kept from us is the true story of the mother all conspiracy theories, and it has been ongoing for my entire life.\n\nWhat has also become truth rather than speculation is that non-human intelligent beings have targeted our and everyone else's nuclear facilities as points of interest, and in fact have and continue to launch facility incursions and active interference since the United States dropped Fat Man and Little Boy on Japan to end WWII in 1945. Apparently, E.T. is just as freaked out about thermonuclear weapons as we are.\n\nWe have a front row seat to the most significant rewrite of the human culture of all time. The aftershock to be felt around the world by redefining what it means to be a human is yet to be seen. What is clear is that we are not alone in the universe.\n\nWhat also is clear, is that the giant leaps in technology that have occurred throughout the baby boomer timeline was significantly accelerated by reverse engineering efforts by the military-industrial complex contractors on recovered alien technology. Revealed in open testimony in Congress on Nov. 13, 2024, the 2024 code word for the government reverse engineering program is \"Immaculate Constellation.\" Prior to that day, saying that in public would get you an espionage act arrest with no bail.\n\nYou don't think that we went from the Model-T to the moon in 50 years on the power of the human brain alone do you?\n\nI was reminded of what seemed to be the extremely odd warning delivered to Americans in 1961 by outgoing President Dwight Eisenhower in his farewell address to the nation, which now makes a hell of a lot of sense:\n\n\"A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.\n\n\"American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.\n\n\"This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.\n\n\"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.\n\n\"The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\"\n\nEisenhower, and his predecessor Harry Truman, who was president at the beginning of the UFO era, have been the only two chief executives who have been fully briefed on the existence of non-human life forms and alien technologies.\n\nJust ask Bill Clinton.\n\nI feel a little less slighted as I guess the military industrial complex couldn't trust the president who is always a short term temp worker anyway.\n\nIn 1947, in the shadow of WWII, with America feeling pretty good and not too concerned about government, Truman formed the CIA and began the first disinformation and psychological operation mandates for UFO events. The counter-intelligence efforts used against American citizens were applied quickly, quietly and harshly, a key component to keeping the greatest secret never told.\n\nThe disinformation delivered has been near perfect in effect as government made the choice for all of us, without a vote at all, to conceal the truth regarding UFOs because it was the early assessment that we as a society could not handle it.\n\nAs I think about what this new reality means, it comes with hope, but also anger, for how many of the extinction level crises we face on Earth today, could have already been remedied had power and money not won out in 1947.\n\nFor all those friends and relatives that have been long-suffering UFO believers who you called crackpots or worse all these years, you better tell them you were wrong and that you are sorry. Buy them a Roswell T-shirt for Christmas. Contrition is certainly warranted.\n\nIt was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, who in his 1885 work \"The Fate of Evangeline,\" wrote, \"Once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.\"\n\nIt was Mr. Spock, in the 1991 movie \"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,\" who repeated this axiom in its now proper and correct setting. Space the final frontier.\n\nImagine that."

But Pensive delves deep into the enormous potential of AI, grounded in evidence-based techniques and drawing on everything from classical schools of thought like Buddhism and Stoicism to modern psychology and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n\nAlways There for You\n\nPensive\u2019s mental wellness benefits come from daily conversations that are as short as 5 minutes long, and can be used on their own or in conjunction with traditional human therapy. While Pensive is not a replacement for diagnosing or professionally treating mental health disorders, it has shown immense promise as an addition to traditional therapy and also as a personal coach to help people solve their problems.\n\nWith an average user rating of 4.9/5 stars in the App Store, it\u2019s clear that early users of this groundbreaking app are experiencing real benefits from it.

            "article_content": "When I hear the word \"budgeting,\" I don't typically think of the word \"fun.\" While I've enjoyed test-driving popular tools such as YNAB and EveryDollar, most budgeting apps make me feel like I'm 16 years old and listening to my parents lecture me on the dangers of overspending.\n\nCleo, however, is an exception to the norm. The app makes managing your money feel more like a game with spending and saving challenges, and its sassy AI chatbot might actually make you smile. For example, it invited me to \"unfuck\" my finances\" -- a phrase that has definitely never emerged from my parents' mouths.\n\nRead on to learn more about Cleo and whether it's worth adding to your phone.\n\nCleo Like Sassy AI chatbot\n\nSassy AI chatbot Savings challenges\n\nSavings challenges Free basic budgeting features Don't like AI doesn't mean \"hands-off\"\n\nAI doesn't mean \"hands-off\" Cash advances may be too tempting\n\nCash advances may be too tempting Paid features may not be worth it\n\nHow does Cleo work?\n\nCleo feels similar to most budgeting apps when it comes to the basics of money management. You share your banking details via a secure third-party service, such as Plaid, and your transaction history automatically populates in the app's \"Spend\" tab.\n\nYou'll get a monthly breakdown in four categories: What's due, what you've saved, what you've spent and an overall limit.\n\nFor me, the most useful information came from the \"Overview\" section, which showed me my credit card spending by merchant. I knew I went to Target a lot, but I wasn't quite prepared to learn that last year, I spent more than $4,389 there.\n\nWhat sets Cleo apart is the \"Ask Cleo\" tab, which allows you to talk with an AI chatbot about your money. For example, I asked if I could afford to spend $500 on a gift, and after a quick analysis of the cash in my accounts, the chatbot told me, \"Go for it, pal.\" The bot also invites you to take a quiz to see how well you understand your finances.\n\nThe app is fun, but it's not perfect. For example, it incorrectly assumed some one-time purchases were recurring bills.\n\nCleo has a free version, which gives you basic budgeting features, as well as three paid subscription tiers:\n\nCleo Grow ($2.99 a month) offers savings challenges and access to Cleo's high-yield savings account.\n\noffers savings challenges and access to Cleo's high-yield savings account. Cleo Plus ($5.99 a month) allows you to request cash advances up to $250.\n\nallows you to request cash advances up to $250. Cleo Builder ($14.99 a month) allows you to requestcash advances up to $500 and add a secured credit card to your wallet.\n\nWhat I liked\n\nArtificial intelligence encourages real accountability: Finances can be an awkward topic, and having someone -- or something -- to hold you accountable can help you stay on track. Cleo's AI can act as that accountability partner without the discomfort that can come with normal money discussions.\n\nFinances can be an awkward topic, and having someone -- or something -- to hold you accountable can help you stay on track. Cleo's AI can act as that accountability partner without the discomfort that can come with normal money discussions. Challenges can keep you motivated: Cleo automatically reviews your transaction history to identify where you should try to spend less. For example, the app recommended I limit my Target spending to $158 for the next 14 days for an estimated savings of $40. Cleo delivered updates and encouragement throughout the challenge to encourage me to stick with it.\n\nCleo automatically reviews your transaction history to identify where you should try to spend less. For example, the app recommended I limit my Target spending to $158 for the next 14 days for an estimated savings of $40.

Free features: You can automatically sync your bank accounts and get a basic understanding of your cash flow without paying anything for the app. The functionality is limited, though. For example, you can't use the challenge feature without upgrading to a paid tier. But the free version is still a valuable way to see if you like the app before signing up for a subscription.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\nAI doesn't mean you should your money on autopilot: I believe that AI can help solve some people's money problems, but it can't do it all. While I was genuinely impressed with Cleo's AI chatbot, the app's automated understanding of my bills was far from perfect. And overspending is a human problem, so you need to commit some of your own energy to make budgeting a success.\n\nI believe that AI can help solve some people's money problems, but it can't do it all. While I was genuinely impressed with Cleo's AI chatbot, the app's automated understanding of my bills was far from perfect. And overspending is a human problem, so you need to commit some of your own energy to make budgeting a success. Cash advances aren't a long-term solution: Cleo offers interest-free cash advances between $250 and $500. These can be appealing if you're struggling to make ends meet, but they won't help you learn to avoid the need for extra cash in the future. A cash advance should be a one-time necessity, not a regular solution.\n\nCleo offers interest-free cash advances between $250 and $500. These can be appealing if you're struggling to make ends meet, but they won't help you learn to avoid the need for extra cash in the future. A cash advance should be a one-time necessity, not a regular solution. Paid features may not be worth it: In addition to cash advances, the main perks of Cleo's paid tiers include access to a secured credit card and savings account. With plenty of free bank accounts and secured credit cards out there, this isn't all that unique. And while Cleo's savings account has a respectable 3.52% annual percentage yield, or APY, some of the best high-yield savings accounts pay as much as 5% APY.\n\nIs Cleo safe?\n\nYes. Cleo uses 256-bit encryption to protect your information. It also uses Plaid to sync with your bank accounts and never stores any of your banking details. In addition, the company doesn't sell your data, which means you never have to worry that your financial information will wind up in the hands of some other company trying to sell you additional products or services.\n\nWho is Cleo best suited for?\n\nIf you're bored by the usual budgeting apps or need help sticking to your spending goals, Cleo could be for you. Its fun AI chatbot and custom savings challenges can make budgeting more enjoyable and motivate you to be smarter with your money.\n\nThe app's features also feel tailored to people who haven't had a great experience with the traditional banking industry. For example, if you've struggled with overdraft fees or need help boosting your credit, Cleo's Builder tier offers cash advances and a secured credit card.\n\nAlternatives to the Cleo app\n\nThere are plenty of other budgeting apps worth considering if Cleo isn't right for you. For example, Rocket Money has plenty of features and an easy-to-use interface for free or as little as $6 a month.\n\nIf you're attracted to Cleo's cash advances and savings account, you might enjoy Chime. Chime is a banking app rather than a budgeting app, but it offers a secured credit card, a checking account and a high-yield savings account -- without the need to pay monthly fees. Plus, its MyPay tool allows you to access up to $500 of your paycheck early, free of charge. (Unless you need the cash immediately, in which case there's a $2 fee).\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Cleo legit? Yes. Cleo has been in business since 2016 and available in the US since 2018. According to the company's latest figures, more than five million people use the app. Cleo partners with Thread Bank for its savings account and WebBank for its secured credit card.\n\nHow much does Cleo cost? Cleo has a free version with limited functionality. To take advantage of more of the app's features, you can upgrade to one of the three paid tiers. Cleo Grow costs $2.99 a month and includes the ability to create challenges, round up spending and open a linked high-yield savings account. Cleo Plus costs $5.99 a month and offers cash advances up to $250. Cleo Builder costs $14.99 a month and includes a secured credit card, priority customer support and cash advances up to $500.\n\nIs Cleo worth paying for? With 4.6 out of 5 stars on the App Store and 4.3 on Google Play, it's clear that a lot of people love Cleo. Its AI chatbot is a useful way to learn more about your finances, and its casual tone injects some fun into budgeting. That said, you can get many of the premium services Cleo offers without a monthly fee. For example, Chime's Credit Builder Card has no annual fee, and the financial tech company's online checking account offers a $500 payday advance option for eligible users -- all at no extra cost. So, if you're thinking of springing for one of Cleo's pricier subscriptions, you may want to weigh your options.\n\nMore budgeting apps"

            "article_content": "Increasingly, over the last few decades, modern pop culture has warmed up to embracing the frightful chills of the winter holidays in films like Gremlins, Black Christmas, Terrifier 3 \u2026 Love Actually. But the historical roots of this time of year have always had a darker, spookier side. Long before Charles Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol \u2014 an era when families of Victorian England gathered to share ghost stories by the fire on Christmas Eve \u2014 pre-Christian folklore told of a thin veil between worlds, where spirits (and goblins, beasts, and gods) lingered during the winter solstice.\n\nThose ancient beliefs blend with modern natural introspection of the holidays. Along with the (sometimes saccharine) jubilations, Christmas and the winter festivities encourage people to reflect on the past, lost loved ones, and the lingering \u201cghosts\u201d of memory. Add to that how this month is populated by magical home invaders, and a creepy surveillance imp on the shelf, and December is a rather fitting time for mystery, the macabre, and paranormal tales.\n\nCelebrating the scarier side of the holidays is not only a sort of subversive counter-programming by pairing cheer with fear, it allows us to acknowledge the dichotomy of light and dark, contrasting cozy, nostalgic evenings with long, eerily silent nights.\n\nAll of this is a very drawn out way of saying I love getting creepy, spooky, and downright scary gifts for the holidays, and I love shopping for loved ones who also appreciate a little splash of blood red with their Christmases so white. And so, we return with a Talking Strange Show \u201cSeason\u2019s Screamings Gift Guide\u201d for 2024. After the success of last year\u2019s guide, we are going bigger and bloodier with gift suggestions for the horror and paranormal fans in your life. Comic books, action figures, statues, graphic novels, swanky shirts and hats, paranormal investigation equipment, and even some vodka and cologne are all included, and all part of the theme."

(WKRC) -\n\nWhile the physical structure is being dismantled, the fate of the supernatural entities that allegedly haunted the venue for decades remains a mystery. Laura Roland, who runs and has offered tours detailing the haunted history of Bobby Mackey's for 10 years, shared her insights on the paranormal activity associated with the site.\n\n\"Everything from shadowy figures, full-bodied apparitions. We hear voices either just with our ears or on a recorder. Pretty much everything has happened here at Mackey's. People have been scratched, touched, pushed,\" Roland said.\n\nRoland explained that because paranormal study isn't an exact science, the future of the spirits is uncertain.\n\n\"Many people think that the spirits are attached to the land and that whatever is built on this property, the spirits will still be here,\" said Roland.\n\nIf the spirits are indeed tied to the land, they may linger around whatever is constructed on the site. However, Roland noted another possibility: the supernatural specters might be connected to the building or its contents, in which case they would dissipate and move on.\n\n\"I definitely think that there were spirits that were attached to the building. Like I said, the man that was killed. But also, I think there could be some that are attached to the land. And Bobby does plan to rebuild a new club on the spot. So there's a very good chance that that new club will be haunted as well,\" Roland said.\n\nBobby Mackey's has temporarily relocated to the old Mugbee's location in Florence, with plans to open a new building and club on the original site by 2026.\n\nThe mystery of Bobby Mackey's continues to captivate those intrigued by the paranormal, leaving many to wonder if the apparitions and specters will continue to haunt the property."

            "article_content": "It may not have won \u201cWord of the Year,\u201d but romantasy is still the reigning champion of many readers' hearts.\n\nAlex Belanger shares her romantasy recommendations with more than 16,000 followers on TikTok. Because the 31-year-old Kentuckian grew up in a sheltered religious sect, she's always been drawn to \u201cRapunzel\u201d stories. Fairytales about broadening worldviews and unexplored places were a childhood comfort. During the pandemic, she stumbled into romantasy books on TikTok, and found they both reminded her of her youth and reflected her interests as an adult.\n\nBelanger is just one of the many readers steering one of publishing's prized horses \u2013 the genre's sales increased 42% from 2022 to 2023, according to Circana.\n\nWhat is romantasy?\n\nA portmanteau of the words \u201cromance\u201d and \u201cfantasy,\u201d romantasy blends two beloved genres. Readers get all the best parts of swoony love story tropes, magical world-building and high-stakes adventure.\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\nMany romantasy books include fae or fairies, dragons, elves and other mythical creatures. Popular series \u201cA Court of Thorns and Roses\u201d by Sarah J. Maas is a \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d retelling set in a divided realm of humans and faeries. \u201cFourth Wing\u201d by Rebecca Yarros, another romantasy favorite, follows a young girl training to become a dragon rider.\n\nThe world-building is more expansive than many other romance subgenres. In paranormal romance, for example, magical characters often appear in normal society rather than in an entirely new, imagined land.\n\nBut the two genres often overlap, especially with their readership. Ali Hazelwood\u2019s \u201cBride,\u201d which features a romance between a vampire and werewolf, was a recent hit with romantasy fans.\n\n\u201cThe blurring of these lines is just exciting and expansive and allows authors and publishers to have a greater diversification of contents, of character,\u201d says Ashley Doliber, the senior director of marketing strategy at Entangled Publishing, which houses such series as Rebecca Yarros' \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Obsidian\" by Jennifer L. Armentrout. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to color within certain lines, you have the opportunity to really push those boundaries.\u201d\n\nIs romantasy the right genre for you?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a fantasy fanatic to get in on the fun. Many readers credit romantasy series like \u201cACOTAR\u201d as the reason they got back into reading, even if they were initially hesitant to try the genre. And despite their length, they tend to be fast-paced, immersive reads.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to choose from, which keeps the genre fresh, says Belanger. She recommends switching up the tropes and types of mythical beings in your books. Worlds inhabited by fairies or dragons are among the most popular, but she's recently seen an uptick in \u201cshifter\u201d protagonists, who, as the name suggests, can morph between human and animal forms.\n\nRomantasy is also the perfect genre for those who grew up reading fan fiction.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to find a lot of the people that write romantasy are the people that wrote fan fiction in the past,\u201d Belanger says.\n\nJulie Soto, author of \u201cRose in Chains,\u201d used to write \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fan fiction. Hazelwood\u2019s \u201cThe Love Hypothesis\u201d was originally published online as \u201cReylo\u201d fan fiction (yes \u2013 as in Rey and Kylo Ren from \u201cStar Wars\u201d).\n\nMore than just \u2018spicy\u2019: Readers find romantasy empowering\n\nThere\u2019s something so unputdownable about stepping into a magical world and finding your OTP (one true pairing).\n\nSteamy romance novels are sometimes seen as the fluff of the literary world. Society has long been quick to invalidate female sexuality and empowerment as \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d reads.\n\n\u201cThat escapism aspect is certainly key,\u201d Doliber says. \u201cBut I think what a lot of genre fiction allows is the opportunity to simultaneously have that fun, joyful, thought-provoking escapism (and) at the same time, you\u2019re tackling real-world themes\u201d like female empowerment and agency.\n\nIt\u2019s also one corner of the internet where readers have been able to embrace their sexuality and center female pleasure. Some readers told HuffPost that romance books and erotica have helped improve their sex lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really great way to help your mind become open and break away from purity culture,\u201d Belanger says. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in a woman\u2019s pleasure and knowing what you want.\u201d\n\nBest romantasy books\n\nRomantasy may be buzzy, but it\u2019s not a new genre. Belanger cites \"foundational\" romantasy reads (which, in the 2010s, were more medieval than fae) like Mary E. Pearson\u2019s \u201cThe Remnant Chronicles\u201d and Marissa Meyer\u2019s fairytale retellings in \u201cThe Lunar Chronicles.\u201d\n\nModern classics include Sarah J.

            "article_content": "Imagine knowing you\u2019ve already made an important contribution to biomedical research before you\u2019ve even started high school. This is a reality for a young Chicago student who recently found a bacterium that exhibits antibiotic activity and produces a novel compound that slows the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells in the lab. Where did this startling discovery come from? Well, goose poop of course.\n\nThis budding young middle school scientist was part of a community partnership with a local university that engages kids from underrepresented and low-income backgrounds. The team partnered with Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, which allowed them to engage with middle schoolers as part of a 14-week applied science program.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nInequality in educational resources, especially for STEM subjects, has often prevented some students from accessing these fields when they\u2019re older. However, a team from the University of Illinois at Chicago, led by Brian Murphy, has established a partnership that engages such groups at an early stage in their educational development. The hope is that, by providing them with a chance to conduct real, high-quality research, these young students will come to see themselves as scientists and explore related careers in the future.\n\nAs Murphy\u2019s lab is focused on finding antibiotics from natural sources, the students helped scour their local communities for environmental samples. Before someone suggests this was just a way to outsource sample gathering, the students then followed up on the stages of scientific processing, especially for programming a specialized robot that removes bacterial colonies from growth plates and tests them for antibiotic activity.\n\n\u201cAll experiments are performed under the guidance of graduate student or postdoctoral scientist volunteer mentors\u201d, the researchers explain in their study.\n\n\u201cEach student collected 3 samples of their choice from Garfield Park in Chicago, IL. Students pretreated and diluted their samples before plating each one on three different media types [....] While their bacteria incubated, they practiced block programming on LEGO EV3 modules in preparation for robot operation. When their environmental diversity plates exhibited sufficient bacterial growth, students programmed and operated the Hudson Robotics RapidPickMP to pick all distinguishable colonies from their environmental diversity plates and transfer them onto dual-sided agar plate assay (DAPA) bioassay plates.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDuring their search, one student returned with a sample of goose poop that contained a strain of bacteria called Pseudomonas idahonensis \u2013 a species that had previously been isolated from rainbow trout in Idaho (idahonensis means \u201cfrom Idaho). The student, Camarria Williams, and Jonathon Rodriguez, Technology Program Manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, are listed as co-authors of the paper\n\nIt was concluded that this bacterium had antibiotic activity and even produced a completely new-to-science compound. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry, the university researchers were able to determine that orfamide N was not actually responsible for the antibiotic activity observed before. However, the compound did hinder the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells when it was tested in the laboratory.\n\nIt is believed that further testing could reveal additional advantageous properties of this new molecule.\n\nThis project demonstrates that it is possible to combine educational outreach with natural product discovery research while also showing how important it is to develop strong relationships between universities and local communities. In particular, it offers typically under-represented students a chance to be scientists themselves and to make incredible discoveries like this!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGuess we should also thank the goose for providing its poop as well.\n\nThe study is published in the journal ACS Omega."

            "article_content": "Dear General Bonta:\n\nAs a California company that builds Generative AI technology, Meta Platforms, Inc. (\u201cMeta\u201d) is deeply concerned about OpenAI\u2019s attempt to shed the non-profit status under which it was founded in order to establish a for-profit entity. We urge you to review this proposed transaction, including the nature and timing of any transfer of assets from OpenAI\u2019s non-profit entity to other entities. Failing to hold OpenAI accountable for its choice to form as a non-profit could lead to a proliferation of similar start-up ventures that are notionally charitable until they are potentially profitable. The People of California have direct and urgent interests in stopping this behavior. All for-profit activities of OpenAI and its related entities should be paused to protect investors and consumers alike.\n\nIn 2015, OpenAI filed its original certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware, which reads:\n\nThis Corporation shall be a nonprofit corporation organized exclusively for charitable and/or educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c){3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the corresponding provision of any future United States Internal Revenue law. The specific purpose of this corporation is to provide funding for research, development and distribution of technology related to artificial intelligence... The corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person... The property of this corporation is irrevocably dedicated to the[se] purposes... and no part of the net income or assets of this corporation shall ever inure to the benefit of any director, officer or member thereof or to the benefit of any private person.\n\nOpenAI reaffirmed this commitment on its very own website years later:\n\nSeeing no clear path in the public sector, and given the success of other ambitious projects in private industry, [OpenAI] decided to pursue this project through private means bound by strong commitments to the public good. [OpenAI] initially believed a 501(c)(3) would be the most effective vehicle to direct the development of safe and broadly beneficial AGI while remaining unencumbered by profit incentives.\n\nTaking advantage of this non-profit status, OpenAI raised billions of dollars in capital from investors to further its purported mission. The company represented to the State of California and the world that it would be run without any profit motivation. Investors and the public rightfully relied on that assurance.\n\nNow, OpenAI wants to change its status while retaining all of the benefits that enabled it to reach the point it has today. That is wrong. OpenAI should not be allowed to flout the law by taking and reappropriating assets it built as a charity and using them for potentially enormous private gains.\n\nMoreover, OpenAI\u2019s proposed conversion represents not simply a future, potential abuse of corporate form. We would also urge you to examine whether OpenAI\u2019s past practices are consistent with its obligations as a non-profit \u2013 most notably whether it has inappropriately depleted the assets of the non-profit by distributing assets to third-party entities.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s conduct could have seismic implications for Silicon Valley. If permitted, OpenAI\u2019s restructuring would represent a paradigm shift for technology startups; allowing this restructuring would only entice investors to launch organizations as non-profits, collect hundreds of millions of dollars in tax-free donations to support research and development, and then assume for-profit status as its technology becomes commercially viable.\n\nIndeed, if OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government and, ultimately, the public. That would distort the market by essentially requiring any startup seeking to remain competitive to adopt the same playbook.\n\nWe understand that Elon Musk and Shivon Zilis are currently seeking to represent the public interests in Musk v. Altman, No. 4:24-cv-04722-YGR (N.D. Cal.). Although we would also urge your office to take direct action, we believe that Mr. Musk and Ms. Zilis are qualified and well positioned to represent the interests of Californians in this matter. Their early, foundational roles in OpenAI\u2019s creation and operations and as prior members of its Board position them to understand better than anyone what OpenAI was intended to be and how its current conduct deviates from its charitable mission.\n\nMeta is committed to openness and transparency in the transformative field of AI. OpenAI\u2019s charitable promise to develop safe and broadly beneficial AI free from commercial pressures is an important one, and it should be kept. Given the breakneck speed at which OpenAI is continuing its for-profit conversion, this is a special case with an urgent necessity for action.\n\nWe appreciate your consideration of our views and are happy to answer any questions you may have.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nMeta Platforms"

            "article_content": "People affected by the ParkMobile parking app\u2019s 2021 data breach could receive up to $25 as part of a class action settlement. Here\u2019s how to submit a claim.\n\nVERIFY often fact-checks settlement notices so our readers know whether they are legitimate or fraudulent.\n\nSome people, including a VERIFY journalist, received emails in December notifying them about a ParkMobile class action settlement due to a data breach. ParkMobile is a mobile parking payment app that is used in many U.S. states.\n\nGoogle Trends data show many people online are wondering if the ParkMobile data breach settlement is legitimate.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nIs the ParkMobile data breach settlement real?\n\nTHE SOURCES\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nYes, the ParkMobile data breach settlement is real.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nParkMobile customers who were notified about the parking app\u2019s 2021 data breach could receive up to $25 as part of a proposed class action settlement.\n\nThe parking payment app company agreed to a $32.8 million settlement following a 2021 lawsuit alleging it failed to protect people\u2019s personal information, court records show. ParkMobile denied any wrongdoing or liability, an official settlement website says.\n\nParkMobile also acknowledged the settlement and linked out to the official website on Dec. 5.\n\nA class action lawsuit was filed in Georgia about two months after ParkMobile confirmed a \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d linked to a third-party software in March 2021. The lawsuit alleges that about 21 million users\u2019 personal information was compromised in the data breach.\n\nAccording to ParkMobile, the leaked information included license plate numbers, email addresses, phone numbers and mailing addresses, as well as encrypted passwords but not the encryption keys required to read them. Users\u2019 credit card numbers were not leaked, the company said.\n\nWho qualifies for the settlement\n\nAnyone who received a notice from ParkMobile about the 2021 data security incident is eligible to submit a claim, according to the official website. People who are eligible also should have received an emailed notice about the class action settlement.\n\nIf you are still unsure about whether you\u2019re eligible for the settlement, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at 1-866-944-4062.\n\nAccording to the official website, $9 million of the proposed settlement has been set aside for cash payments to people affected by the data breach. The amount of money each person can receive is capped at $25, the website says.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t submit claims for cash payments will receive $1 credits from ParkMobile via email.\n\nHow to submit a claim\n\nPeople who are eligible for the settlement must submit a claim by Wednesday, March 5, 2025, the settlement website says.\n\nYou can submit a claim online using the ID and confirmation code on your mailed or emailed notice. If you don\u2019t have the notice ID and confirmation code, you can look up your login by entering your name and email address.\n\nYou can also print out a claim form here and mail it postmarked no later than March 5 to this address: ParkMobile Data Security Incident, Attn: Claim Forms, 1650 Arch Street, Suite 2210, Philadelphia, PA 19103.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when people who are eligible for the settlement could receive their payments."

            "article_content": "In 2024, researchers turned up possible evidence of ancient life on Mars, hints that Alzheimer\u2019s disease can spread from person-to-person and a slew of other scientific findings that could be a big deal \u2014 if they\u2019re the real deal.\n\nMartian microbes, maybe\n\nAlien microbes may have once made their home on Mars (SN: 8/24/24, p. 6). In July, NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover uncovered a rock on the Red Planet that sports white spots with black rings laced with iron phosphate (see Page 28). On Earth, such specks have been linked to ancient micro\u00adbial life. But they\u2019re not surefire signs of microbes. The only way to know for certain is to bring the rock back to Earth for closer inspection.\n\nNASA\u2019s Perseverance rover discovered leopard spot\u2013like features in this Martian rock (closeup image shown). On Earth, similar structures are associated with microbial life. MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASA\n\nSparking superconductivity\n\nLight may be the secret ingredient for making superconductors that don\u2019t require frigid conditions. In an experiment, blasting a copper and oxygen compound with a laser caused the material to throw off magnetic fields. That magnetism, the scientists say, is a smoking gun for superconductivity \u2014 the ability to ferry electricity with no resistance (SN: 8/10/24, p. 6). But skeptics contend that those magnetic fields might have arisen from some other, unknown physics.\n\nIn experiments, a compound made of copper and oxygen atoms (blue and red spheres in this illustration) blasted with laser light (red) threw off magnetic fields (blue). This effect signals that the compound transformed into a superconductor, some physicists say. Sebastian Fava, J\u00f6rg M. Harms\n\nAncient engineering\n\nBuilders used a water-powered elevator to construct Egypt\u2019s first pyramid nearly 4,700 years ago, researchers propose (SN: 9/7/24 & 9/21/24, p. 11). That controversial idea is based on a computer model of structures in and around the Step Pyramid of Djoser. Controlling the flow of floodwater in and out of a shaft inside the pyramid could have lifted and lowered a block-hoisting platform, the model shows. But critics argue that occasional rains wouldn\u2019t have supplied enough water to sustain such a system.\n\nAncient workers could have built Egyptian King Djoser\u2019s pyramid (shown) using a water-powered elevator to hoist the heavy stone blocks, a computer simulation suggests. But not all archaeologists are on board with the idea. Anton Petrus/Moment/Getty Images\n\nTectonic shake-up\n\nPlate tectonics got off to an early start in Earth\u2019s history, a rock in South Africa suggests. Layers in the rock bear scars of 3-billion-year-old landslides that may have been caused by an earthquake (SN: 4/6/24, p. 6). That quake, scientists say, could have been triggered by slabs of crust colliding. The finding lends support to the contested idea that plate tectonics dates back more than 2.8 billion years. But other geologists are not convinced that this quake marks the start of global plate tectonics.\n\nLayers of rock at the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa contain hints of a huge earthquake triggered by plate tectonics more than 3 billion years ago. Simon Lamb\n\nMedium size, maximum hype\n\nFor the first time, astronomers may have spotted a midsize black hole in our galaxy (SN: 8/10/24, p. 7). Telescope data suggest that a black hole at least 8,200 times as massive as the sun lurks in the star cluster Omega Centauri. But another study disputes the claim. Instead, the star cluster could harbor a horde of smaller black holes (SN: 8/20/24).\n\nIf a rare midsize black hole truly does lurk in the heart of the Omega Centauri star cluster, it would be the first black hole of its size found in the Milky Way. In this Hubble Space Telescope image, the supposed black hole\u2019s location is marked by the white box. Hubble/ESA, NASA, M. H\u00e4berle/MPIA\n\nTransmissible Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is not contagious in everyday life, but under extremely rare conditions, it may spread from one person to another (SN: 2/24/24, p. 6). Five people who in childhood received contaminated growth hormone injections later developed early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 most likely because the hormones were tainted with amyloid-beta, a protein whose buildup is linked to the disease, researchers say. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether the growth hormones are to blame, other experts note. Perhaps the health conditions that those hormones were meant to treat or other medical procedures led to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s in these patients.\n\nHigh levels of the protein amyloid-beta \u2014 a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 appear orange and purple in this brain scan of a man with the disease. Childhood exposure to the protein via contaminated growth hormone injections may have led the man to develop Alzheimer\u2019s later in life. G. Banerjee et al/Nature Medicine 2024\n\nShedding light on dark energy\n\nDark energy may have gotten even more mysterious. The enigmatic stuff, which makes up the bulk of the cosmos, is generally thought to maintain a constant density. But new observations of 6.4 million galaxies and quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, or DESI, paired with data on exploding stars, cast doubt on that idea. These data more closely fit a model of the universe in which the relationship between dark energy\u2019s density and its pressure changes over time (SN: 5/4/24 & 5/18/24, p. 6). If confirmed, this finding would rewrite the history of the universe. Experts are withholding judgment until DESI completes its survey of over 30 million other galaxies (SN: 12/14/24 & 12/28/24, p. 7)."

This is a reality for a young Chicago student who recently found a bacterium that exhibits antibiotic activity and produces a novel compound that slows the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells in the lab. Where did this startling discovery come from? Well, goose poop of course.\n\nThis budding young middle school scientist was part of a community partnership with a local university that engages kids from underrepresented and low-income backgrounds. The team partnered with Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, which allowed them to engage with middle schoolers as part of a 14-week applied science program.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nInequality in educational resources, especially for STEM subjects, has often prevented some students from accessing these fields when they\u2019re older. However, a team from the University of Illinois at Chicago, led by Brian Murphy, has established a partnership that engages such groups at an early stage in their educational development. The hope is that, by providing them with a chance to conduct real, high-quality research, these young students will come to see themselves as scientists and explore related careers in the future.\n\nAs Murphy\u2019s lab is focused on finding antibiotics from natural sources, the students helped scour their local communities for environmental samples. Before someone suggests this was just a way to outsource sample gathering, the students then followed up on the stages of scientific processing, especially for programming a specialized robot that removes bacterial colonies from growth plates and tests them for antibiotic activity.\n\n\u201cAll experiments are performed under the guidance of graduate student or postdoctoral scientist volunteer mentors\u201d, the researchers explain in their study.\n\n\u201cEach student collected 3 samples of their choice from Garfield Park in Chicago, IL. Students pretreated and diluted their samples before plating each one on three different media types [....] While their bacteria incubated, they practiced block programming on LEGO EV3 modules in preparation for robot operation. When their environmental diversity plates exhibited sufficient bacterial growth, students programmed and operated the Hudson Robotics RapidPickMP to pick all distinguishable colonies from their environmental diversity plates and transfer them onto dual-sided agar plate assay (DAPA) bioassay plates.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDuring their search, one student returned with a sample of goose poop that contained a strain of bacteria called Pseudomonas idahonensis \u2013 a species that had previously been isolated from rainbow trout in Idaho (idahonensis means \u201cfrom Idaho). The student, Camarria Williams, and Jonathon Rodriguez, Technology Program Manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, are listed as co-authors of the paper\n\nIt was concluded that this bacterium had antibiotic activity and even produced a completely new-to-science compound. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry, the university researchers were able to determine that orfamide N was not actually responsible for the antibiotic activity observed before. However, the compound did hinder the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells when it was tested in the laboratory.\n\nIt is believed that further testing could reveal additional advantageous properties of this new molecule.\n\nThis project demonstrates that it is possible to combine educational outreach with natural product discovery research while also showing how important it is to develop strong relationships between universities and local communities. In particular, it offers typically under-represented students a chance to be scientists themselves and to make incredible discoveries like this!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGuess we should also thank the goose for providing its poop as well.\n\nThe study is published in the journal ACS Omega."

            "article_content": "We have discovered thousands of exoplanets in the last few decades, while the number of planets in the Solar System has remained at eight \u2013 but our discovery of more might not yet be over.\n\nA team of researchers say they have found the \"strongest statistical evidence yet that Planet 9 is really out there\", after studying a population of distant, unstable objects that cross Neptune's orbit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn 2015, two astronomers from Caltech presented evidence that six objects past the orbit of Neptune were bunched together in a way that suggested they were being \"herded\" by something with a large gravitational pull.\n\nDespite suggestions the planet could be due to a statistical anomaly and selection bias, the team believes the objects could be moving due to the influence of a large object beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\nIn a recent paper, the team looked at long-period objects that crossed the path of Neptune's orbit, finding that their closest point of orbit to the sun was around 15-30 astronomical units (AU), with one AU being the distance between the sun and the Earth.\n\n\u24d8 IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCarrying out simulations to try and discover what best explains the orbits of these objects, the team found that a model that includes a massive planet beyond the region of Neptune explained the steady state of these objects much better than in simulations where planet 9 was not included.\n\n\u24d8 IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.\n\nThough this is intriguing, the analysis does not narrow down where to look for such a planet.\n\nIt is also not the only possible explanation for the unusual orbits of trans-Neptunian objects. Another team believes it could be down to a close encounter, where a star passed by our own Sun several billion years ago in our history.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe team ran 3,000 simulations of scenarios where stars of various masses passed by our own at different distances. Though we have only discovered an estimated 1-10 percent of TNOs, making further observations and study of their orbits necessary for a full explanation, the researchers found that a close flyby of a slightly smaller star than our own could produce a Solar System that looks remarkably similar to how it looks today.\n\n\"The best match for today's outer Solar System that we found with our simulations is a star that was slightly lighter than our Sun \u2013 about 0.8 solar masses,\u201d Amith Govind, co-author of the \u201cclose encounter\u201d hypothesis paper, explained in a statement. \"This star flew past our sun at a distance of around 16.5 billion kilometres [10.3 billion miles]. That's about 110 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, a little less than four times the distance of the outermost planet Neptune.\u201d\n\nThankfully, we might not have too long to wait for either hypothesis to be further tested.\n\n\"Excitingly, the dynamics described here, along with all other lines of evidence for Planet 9, will soon face a rigorous test with the operational commencement of the Vera Rubin Observatory,\" the authors of the Planet Nine paper concluded. \"This upcoming phase of exploration promises to provide critical insights into the mysteries of our solar system\u2019s outer reaches.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe \u201cPlanet Nine\u201d study is published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and the \u201cclose encounter\u201d study in Nature Astronomy.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in April 2024."

I reviewed F-Secure Total, an affordable antivirus solution that let me build a plan that covers all my devices with just the features I need.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile we all like to keep an eye on the budget, computer security isn\u2019t the right place to cut corners. The best antivirus software provides excellent protection against online and offline malware at an affordable price.\n\nF-Secure has flexible pricing that you can customize to precisely match your needs. The most affordable plan starts at $50 annually, covering one device with real-time antivirus, scam, and ransomware protection in the browser and offline.\n\nYou probably use a computer, phone, and possibly several other devices. If one gets hacked, all of your social and financial accounts are at risk, as is the personal data stored on that device.\n\nIt makes sense to protect them all and F-Secure plans can cover 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, or more devices. A three-device plan starts at $65, five devices cost $70, and 10 computers, phones, and tablets is $85.\n\nThe options don\u2019t stop there. You can add a VPN with unlimited data for $10 more per year. A password manager and identity monitoring also adds $10 annually. With F-Secure, you pay only for what you need.\n\nStill, you can find better deals on antivirus software, at least for the first year of service. I do like that F-Secure doesn\u2019t have shocking price increases when it\u2019s time to renew.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a free solution, F-Secure has a free malware scan and removal tool. The website describes it as an online scanner, but it\u2019s actually a Windows app that installs on your PC before running.\n\nThe free scanner detects and clears malicious apps that are already active on your computer, but doesn\u2019t protect you from future threats. The best free antivirus software offers good browser protection without requiring a subscription.\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nF-Secure Total Platforms Windows, macOS, iOS, Android Devices Customizable (1-26) Support 24/7 Live Chat Free version? Windows malware scan and removal\n\nDesign\n\nI tested F-Secure Total, the version that includes antivirus, a VPN, identity monitoring, and more. After installing the app, the dashboard showed that real-time protection was active, but there were several other features to set up to maximize my cybersecurity.\n\nI installed the browser extension for online protection, the password manager extension to help secure account logins, and a VPN to prevent activity tracking, then added my email address for monitoring.\n\nWith setup complete, I explored the user interface. The dashboard shows all the active features at a glance and lets me select one to make adjustments. A button at the top left opens a menu with more options, including account details, settings, support, and quick access to all the features.\n\nI opened settings and found there are plenty of options to fine-tune each security feature, such as choosing which folders are locked to protect against ransomware.\n\nOverall, F-Secure Total was easy to get started with and the design is clear and simple, with advanced features accessible via settings.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe number one job of an antivirus is to protect my computer from malware. It should offer real-time detection and blocking to prevent infection. As a second line of defense, it should regularly scan for malicious apps and quarantine them so no harm is done.\n\nTo test how well F-Secure Total performed, I checked its score at full-time cybersecurity labs that continuously monitor the threat landscape and rate the effectiveness of leading antivirus software. F-Secure shows excellent AV-Test scores, falling below perfect only once with a minor miss in June 2023.\n\nF-Secure didn\u2019t fare well in AV-Comparatives scoring system, but a deeper dive into the real-time report reveals it blocked as many threats as antivirus leaders Norton, Avira, and McAfee, which have good protection track records.\n\nF-Secure\u2019s score dropped because it had a high false-positive rate, which includes incorrect app and website blocking. An overprotective antivirus can be annoying, but it isn\u2019t dangerous. In my tests, I didn\u2019t get any false alerts.\n\nI always do spot-checks by visiting Wicar\u2019s malware test website. F-Secure Total\u2019s browser extension successfully identified and blocked all 13 malware downloads and browser exploits.\n\nI tested the password manager and it autofilled logins as expected. It\u2019s not as sophisticated as the best password managers that allow organization and password sharing, but it handles the basics well and syncs across devices.\n\nF-Secure Total\u2019s VPN defaults to OpenVPN protocol, which isn\u2019t the fastest. I tried the only other option, IKEv2, which helped. Still, the best speed I measured was 20% as fast as my usual 900 Mbps. With the best dedicated VPN services, I enjoy over 700 Mbps downloads.\n\nSupport\n\nF-Secure claims it offers 24/7 support via live chat, so I tested that out by asking about login sharing. A live agent answered immediately and continued to respond quickly as I clarified my question.\n\nI\u2019ve reviewed several antivirus services and found that live chat support varies. Solutions like ESET have good support, but during limited hours. Others use chat services that start off quickly, then slow dramatically after the first response. I also verified that live chat with a human is available for F-Secure customers all day, every day.\n\nAs I mentioned above, there\u2019s no password sharing option in F-Secure, but the agent suggested I could copy and send the password via a message, email, or written on paper. I liked the inclusion of an offline solution from tech support.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nF-Secure\u2019s privacy policy is very clear and states that it won\u2019t sell or share your personal data to third-party advertisers. It will comply with legal requests, but it doesn\u2019t allow backdoors in its software. The company is based in Finland, which isn\u2019t part of any intelligence alliances for information sharing.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any record of customer data breaches or cybersecurity incidents, so your personal and financial information should be secure when using F-Secure Total antivirus protection.\n\nIs F-Secure right for you?\n\nThe least inexpensive option, F-Secure Internet Security, offers good protection, but doesn\u2019t beat the best antivirus software. While the VPN and password manager are nice additions to F-Secure Total, dedicated services offer more advanced features.\n\nThe best password managers aren\u2019t that expensive, and you can even find excellent free password managers. The same is true of VPNs. Proton offers a great free VPN], and you can often find VPN deals that minimize your cost without sacrificing speed.\n\nWhile F-Secure Total\u2019s high false positive score is a drawback, I didn\u2019t have any problems with apps or websites being blocked. Also, a false positive is better than allowing malware to run wild on your computer.\n\nThat said, antivirus software like Bitdefender and Norton provide solid protection without the annoyance of overzealous blocking. However, I liked F-Secure Total\u2019s customizable subscription plans and consistent pricing on renewal and still recommend it as a good solution if you want to fine-tune your subscription to exactly what you need."

            "article_content": "Visibility has reached virtually zero as the snow squall rips over the car. The two German engineers shuttling us for a ride in an all-electric prototype of the coming 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class are now talking in somewhat strained tones as more German crackles in over the walkie. We\u2019re backing up slowly as the CLA\u2019s front and rear motors spin all four wheels.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why the road we\u2019re on, the Timmelsjoch Hochalpenstra\u00dfe, a mountain pass that zigzags through the Alps between Austria and Italy and crests at more than 8,200 feet, is closed this time of year. But that\u2019s also the reason why Mercedes decided to hold an event here and get the road open in the first place, so it could highlight how well its 4Matic-equipped cars like the new CLA can handle snowbound road conditions. This was a little bit dicier than Mercedes expected, however.\n\nAfter the conditions calm down some, we\u2019re finally able to rejoin the convoy at the summit on the Italian border where the angular concrete pillbox that is the Timmelsjoch Experience Pass Museum looms over the proceedings, jutting out from the rockface and surveying a breathtakingly dramatic view of the Italian Alps. It\u2019s all been a bit surreal.\n\nFirst Frigid Glances Look Positive\n\nOn the way back, with things more settled weather-wise, we get a chance to ponder the 2026 CLA prototype we\u2019re riding in. This is one of the dual-motor cars, which makes it a 4Matic model in the new-age EV sense. (It will be available in rear-motor EV and hybrid-powered versions, as well.) It employs a 268-hp permanent-magnet motor at the rear supplemented by a 107-hp permanent-magnet motor up front. A two-speed transmission is integrated into the rear drive unit, another efficiency play that makes sense in today\u2019s environment where every mile of range is precious. The front motor's single-speed transmission employs an axle disconnect to further improve efficiency during highway cruising.\n\nMaximizing efficiency was an overarching focus of the new CLA\u2019s development, and Axel Heix, our ace driver and director of development for Mercedes-Benz passenger cars, made sure to call it out when talking about the CLA\u2019s body shape. From what we experienced up close and from the inside, the new car should retain much of the present car\u2019s sloping greenhouse feel, which has been a calling card since its debut. It was already an efficient car from a drag, or lack thereof, perspective, and it will no doubt be even more so for the new model. Mercedes is also claiming the CLA will be 93 percent efficient from the battery to the wheel while driving over long distances.\n\nFrom what we briefly experienced in the back and front passenger seat of the 2026 CLA, this is still a compact car inside, but given its all-new Mercedes Modular Architecture (MMA) and packaging, this 6-footer had no problem with leg- or headroom in the rear of the car, and that was with this car\u2019s glass roof that extended over the greenhouse. Up front, there was more than ample room in the passenger area, as well. The materials of the door panels and armrests that weren\u2019t covered in camouflage featured several soft-touch areas, with a decidedly upscale look reminiscent of today\u2019s higher-end Mercedes models; the seating itself seemed top notch in feel and execution. Although this is the cheapest car in the automaker\u2019s U.S. lineup at present, the new one it won\u2019t be the cheapest-looking or cheapest-feeling from what we experienced.\n\nAbout that packaging. As outlined, the 2026 CLA will be the first Mercedes to roll on the automaker\u2019s new MMA setup, which has been configured to accommodate 800-volt charging. We\u2019re told the car\u2019s 85-kWh battery pack (the only one we\u2019ll get in U.S. models) should charge at up to 320 kW, among the highest power in the industry. (We\u2019ve previously outlined all the ins and outs of the battery and the powertrain. You can read about that here .) The headlines are that we\u2019re estimating the CLA\u2019s overall range should be 350 miles or so to a full charge, with 10 minutes of DC fast charging gaining some 140 miles of range or more, which would make it one of the quickest-charging cars we\u2019ve tested to date. For its part, Mercedes claims the pack can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in less than 22 minutes.\n\nAbout that Charging\n\nSounds great, right? This is where things get a bit choppy. The battery\u2019s 320-kW charging capability is tremendous, and it will be one of only a few cars on the road with that ability when it launches late next year. One potential issue as we see it, though, is with the 2026 CLA\u2019s dual-port charger setup, which has a J1772 plug (the connector that many EV owners have in their garages) for Level 2 AC charging and a NACS plug (the Tesla-designed connector that every automaker is now scrambling to use in the future) for DC fast charging. On the surface, this also sounds good, and for its part, Mercedes sees this, like its 800-volt ability, as another way to help future-proof the CLA. Here\u2019s what it had to say about the setup:\n\n\u201cThe current AC charging infrastructure predominantly utilizes J1772 connectors. By offering both ports, Mercedes-Benz accommodates the existing infrastructure while positioning itself for a future transition to NACS as it becomes more widely adopted. The dual-port configuration in the CLA EV reflects Mercedes-Benz's commitment to providing flexible and user-friendly charging solutions, ensuring compatibility with existing infrastructure while preparing for future advancements in charging standards.\u201d\n\nThe problem is the present. Of the 17,000 or so Tesla Superchargers in the U.S. to date, exactly zero of them are 800-volt units so far. CLA owners who plug into a 400-volt Supercharger will find that their cars only charge at 100 kW rather than the maximum 320 kW. At the moment, the number of 800-volt DC chargers with NACS ports is extremely small\u2014you'll mostly find them on the EVgo network. Electrify America\u2019s chargers are also capable of charging 800-volt vehicles at full power, but those units almost all use the CCS connector (the other DC fast-charging plug that\u2019s eventually going away) . CLA owners will have to carry CCS-to-NACS adapters for the first few years if they want to enjoy the benefits of the MMA platform\u2019s powerful charging capability.\n\nOne of the chief advantages of the slim NACS connector is that it supports AC and DC charging on the same connector pins. But, inexplicably, Mercedes\u2019 NACS port won\u2019t support the AC side of the equation. Plug a Tesla home charger or one of the 40,000 Tesla Destination chargers into the CLA\u2019s NACS port, and the Mercedes just won\u2019t charge.\n\nThe idea of putting two ports on one car sounds like the best of both worlds, but Mercedes has managed to configure the CLA in the most confusing way possible. It seems like somewhere in development a decision was made to do both ports. Maybe things were already too far along, maybe it was easier/more cost effective, but it seems as though the true future-proofing choice would have been to commit to NACS for both AC and DC charging. We get it, though; it\u2019s Monday morning quarterbacking at this point, and it won\u2019t be the end of the world for most owners.\n\nSome Software Revisions Left\n\nThose issues aside, and they are relatively minor in the grand scheme, especially if technology advances quickly, the automaker\u2019s new MMA platform alone is a huge leap forward for the brand, and as a whole the 2026 CLA on paper looks to be a technological tour de force, with dramatically upgraded software being a part of it. At the summit, we asked Heix what was still left to do or further tune before launch. He expressed confidence in the mechanicals of the car and the powertrain. His only real callout was software, which he said was last in line to fine tune by design.\n\nAccording to Heix, the CLA will be using a new iteration of the automaker\u2019s MB.OS software suite of tools. From the brief glimpses of the infotainment screen that we noticed under the flap of camo draping over it, it looks to be a significantly different setup than what\u2019s in present Mercedes models from an interface perspective, and there\u2019s still more than a little development work to do from the sound of it. Just as important, as the world continues to move toward software-defined vehicles, the CLA is also serving as the vanguard of the automaker\u2019s latest efforts in those crucial areas, such as enhanced over-the-air updates.\n\nOur brief snowbound look at the new 2026 Mercedes CLA only further whets our appetite for the final product. We\u2019ll know much more about it sometime early next year when additional details and uncamouflaged photos are revealed, with Mercedes expected to launch the car for sale here late in 2025."

More accurate prediction of outcomes could also help some patients avoid unnecessary side effects and financial toxicity from escalated upfront approaches.\" Pedram Razavi, MD, PhD, Scientific Director, Global Research Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\n\nCurrently, Razavi explained, certain clinical features such as treatment-free interval (TFI), the time between the last dose of adjuvant endocrine therapy and the development of metastatic disease and measurable disease, are the main factors used to identify patients who may be at high risk of early progression on first-line CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations to identify candidates for escalation therapy. Razavi and his colleagues wanted to explore whether a multimodal ML model that included additional clinical and genomic factors could more accurately stratify patients.\n\nUsing OncoCast-MPM, a ML tool developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering, they generated three models to predict progression-free survival (PFS) with CDK4/6 inhibitors: one based on clinicopathological features (CF), another on genomic features (GF), and one integrating CF and GF (CGF). The models were developed using a training cohort of 761 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who received first-line endocrine therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations and had tumor sequencing performed prior to treatment or within two months of the start of treatment with MSK-IMPACT, a test designed to detect gene mutations and match patients to treatments or clinical trials for actionable cancer targets. The performance of the model was tested on a holdout test cohort of 326 patients.\n\nThe models trained on CF and GF each identified three risk groups: high, intermediate, and low, with median PFS of 6.3, 15.2, and 24.5 months for CF, and 9.9, 18.1, and 23.1 months for GF, respectively.\n\nThe CGF integrated model identified four risk groups including two intermediate groups positioned between low- and high-risk categories. The median PFS was 5.3 months in the high-risk group and 29 months in low-risk group, with the intermediate groups showing median PFS of 10.7 and 19.8 months. Notably, the hazard ratio between the high- and low-risk groups was significantly higher in the CGF model (a 6.5-fold difference) compared to CF and GF models (3- to 4-fold difference), indicating a superior stratification of patients with the CGF model. Testing the holdout test cohort yielded nearly identical PFS and hazard ratio results, confirming the robustness of the models.\n\n\"All three models performed really well, surpassing the conventional clinical risk models based on a single or a few clinical features. But the power of the analysis shone when we started combining the clinical and genomic features together,\" Razavi said.\n\nThe clinical and genomic factors that were selected by the ML model were mainly those known to be associated with outcomes or resistance to either CDK4/6 inhibitors or endocrine therapy. Key genomic predictors of poor outcomes were biologically plausible alterations such as TP53 loss, MYC amplifications, PTEN loss, RTK-MAPK pathway alterations, RB1 loss, whole genome doubling, and high proportion of loss of heterozygosity. The major clinical predictors included liver metastasis, TFI less than one year, progesterone receptor negativity, low estrogen receptor expression, and presence of visceral metastasis.\n\n\"All of these variables are potentially available when the patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease, making such ML models broadly applicable. The hope is to integrate these models in clinical trial design of escalation and de-escalation strategies potentially transforming how we approach treatment for newly diagnosed metastatic disease,\" Razavi said. \"Knowing that a patient on first-line CDK4/6 inhibitors is in the high-risk group could prompt the treating oncologists to implement closer disease monitoring and utilizing liquid biopsy and tumor-derived biomarkers to inform second-line treatment options and clinical trials. This could put us one step closer to staying ahead of breast cancer.\"\n\nLimitations of this study include its single-institution design, retrospective data analysis, and potential referral bias associated with specialized cancer centers. To address these challenges, Razavi and his team are validating the model using external data sets and aim to develop an online tool where physicians can input clinical and genomic data to receive patient-specific outcome predictions.\n\nThe study was indirectly and partially supported by the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Defense, Susan G. Komen, Breast Cancer Research Foundation, AstraZeneca, Sophia Genetics, Novartis, and Tempus. Razavi reports consultant, advisory board, or advisor roles for AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Lilly/Loxo Oncology, Novartis, Tempus, Prelude Therapeutics, NeoGenomics, Natera, SAGA Diagnostics, Paige, Guardant Health, Myriad Genetics, and Foresight Diagnostics; and institutional grant/funding from Grail, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Biotheranostics, Tempus, NeoGenomics, Biovica International AB, Guardant Health, Personalis, Myriad Genetics, and Foresight Diagnostics."

But the stock has been in the doghouse. It's down 61.7% from its all-time high (reached in 2021) and up less than 21% from its 10-year low reached on March 19, 2020, during the height of the COVID-19-induced stock market plunge.\n\nThe sell-off may come as a surprise, since Stanley Black & Decker is a Dividend King with a 3.9% yield and 56 consecutive years of dividend raises. Dividend Kings tend to be reliable companies with growing earnings to justify steadily raising their payouts. Here's why the company could be under more pressure in the near term, but may ultimately be worth buying for patient investors.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nFrom record highs to a prolonged turnaround\n\nStanley Black & Decker has been on a roller coaster in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic caused an uptick in home improvement and do-it-yourself projects. Business soared for Stanley Black & Decker. The company got aggressive by taking on debt and making $1.9 billion in acquisitions in December 2021. As you can see in the following chart, Stanley Black & Decker's stock price and net total long-term debt peaked around the same time, highlighting the short-lived period of investor optimism.\n\nUnfortunately, the pandemic-induced spike proved to be short-lived. In hindsight, the boom pulled forward sales in future years, rather than marking a new normal in demand. Overexpanded and overleveraged, Stanley Black & Decker was caught offsides when the cycle shifted into a downturn, resulting in negative cash flow. Over the last couple of years, the company has been implementing a cost-savings plan to get the business back on track. It even sold STANLEY Infrastructure in December 2023 to raise $760 million in cash to help pay down debt.\n\nThe recovery is going decently well so far. The following chart shows improvements in gross margins and operating cash flow. However, Stanley Black & Decker has fallen behind on its goal of reaching 35% gross margins, which has pressured the stock in recent months.\n\nOn its third-quarter 2024 earnings call, the company reported 5% lower revenues than the same period in 2023, showcasing that demand remains weak. However, the company did say that it was on track for its expected $2 billion in pre-tax run-rate cost savings by the end of 2025. For context, it's currently at $1.4 billion in savings since implementing the program a couple of years ago.\n\nStory Continues"

The publication contributed the article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.\n\nWe have only one example of biology forming in the universe \u2013 life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don\u2019t know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth . Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI\u2019m an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology . Through my research, I\u2019ve learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there\u2019s advanced alien life out there, I\u2019m on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars , have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2013 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it\u2019s a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don\u2019t agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \u201cself-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\u201d That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nEvolution vs Natural Selection - YouTube Watch On\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet\u2019s atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA\u2019s definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2013 biological or not \u2013 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nMinerals are an example of a nonliving system that has increased in diversity and complexity over billions of years. (Image credit: UNM Newsroom)\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism\u2019s genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life\u2019s essential molecules \u2013 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they\u2019re unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they\u2019ll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth\u2019s crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system , or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that\u2019s for life as we know it \u2013 for life as we don\u2019t know it, all bets are off.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.

Discover SCENE\n\nU.S. Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ), who posted to his X (formerly known as Twitter) account Friday a video he took of swarms of mysterious drones that have been spotted nightly during the past few weeks, said he was increasingly concerned about the unexplained phenomenon.\n\nKim, who joined local police in rural Clinton Township, New Jersey, 36 miles north of Trenton, said he spotted small clusters of two to four drones a number of times throughout the evening.\n\n\u201cWe often saw about 5-7 lights at a time that were low and not associated with aircraft we could see on the tracker app,\u201d Kim said, noting that the group used a flight tracker app to distinguish the drones from airplanes. \u201cSome hovered while others moved across the horizon.\u201d\n\nLast night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here\u2019s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDn \u2014 Andy Kim (@AndyKimNJ) December 13, 2024\n\nKim said police have tried to get close to the drones using helicopters, but when approached, the drones would turn off their lights and go dark, echoing a statement by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis has gone on for weeks,\u201d Kim wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren\u2019t able to track these devices to determine origin, and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and countermeasures.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, eyewitnesses are pushing back against government claims that the drones pose no threat to communities or infrastructure. The growing story has spread to New York, Maryland, and Connecticut, where officials are demanding answers, while new reports of \u201ccar-sized\u201d UFOs were registered in California and parts of Europe.\n\n\u201cWhy is no one talking about the incident that caused an evac helicopter to not be able to pick up a patient due to these drones being in the way of where the helicopter had to go, and made the helicopter turn around and not be able to get the patient?\u201d New Jersey resident Roseann Stanley said on X. \u201cYet they are saying these drones have not caused any problems. That is a huge problem.\u201d\n\nOn November 26, a medical helicopter heading to an accident in Branchburg Township in Somerset County was unable to pick up an injured patient due to drones hovering near the landing zone, according to a report by New Jersey media outlet NJ.com.\n\nHundreds of drones were first spotted in mid-November flying over New Jersey; eyewitnesses have reported seeing convoys of drones almost every night since then and have described the crafts, in some cases, as being as big as the hood of a car, and performing in more sophisticated ways than off-the-shelf, consumer-oriented drones.\n\nThough the mysterious objects have been reported in the vicinity of a number of New Jersey-based military installations, with speculation about their provenance ranging from aliens from outer space to Iranian spycraft, Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Wednesday that no government facilities have been threatened by the drones.\n\nWhite House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said during a press conference on Thursday that \u201cwhile there is no known malicious activity occurring, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight a gap in authorities.\u201d\n\nKirby argued for new legislation that will better \u201cidentify and mitigate any potential threats to airports or other critical infrastructure, and so that state and local authorities are provided all the tools that they need to respond to such threats as well.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, many people believe the whole thing is much ado about nothing, and probably a stunt of some kind.\n\n\u201cI think these are just normal drones,\u201d Joseph Steinberg, a local resident, told Decrypt. \u201cMy daughter saw a large one, I went outside with her and we looked, but it was hard to judge the size.\u201d\n\n\"The first problem in situations like this is that beyond the initial drone sightings, you quickly get an overwhelming number of reports of things that aren\u2019t drones,\" Grant Jordan, the CEO of San Diego-based drone detection software company SkySafe, told Decrypt. \"When I look at these videos, the vast majority\u201499 out of 100\u2014aren't drones. They're aircraft, helicopters, satellites.\"\n\nAs Jordan explained, the flood of recent drone reports in New Jersey reveals two issues. First, people rarely observe the night sky, and mistake normal air traffic\u2014flashing lights, moving objects\u2014for something unusual. Second, judging the size and distance in the sky is difficult.\n\nWhile Jordan did not attribute these ongoing sightings to a growing hysteria, he did caution that copycats are likely at work, trying to capitalize on the public\u2019s fear and interest.\n\n\"When a story like this gets attention, it draws more people in\u2014some flying drones to look for others, and some just flying them to mess with people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are now seeing these drones in San Diego and the videos that were shown, it's just standard air traffic going into the San Diego Airport.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

            "article_content": "In 2024, researchers turned up possible evidence of ancient life on Mars, hints that Alzheimer\u2019s disease can spread from person-to-person and a slew of other scientific findings that could be a big deal \u2014 if they\u2019re the real deal.\n\nMartian microbes, maybe\n\nAlien microbes may have once made their home on Mars (SN: 8/24/24, p. 6). In July, NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover uncovered a rock on the Red Planet that sports white spots with black rings laced with iron phosphate (see Page 28). On Earth, such specks have been linked to ancient micro\u00adbial life. But they\u2019re not surefire signs of microbes. The only way to know for certain is to bring the rock back to Earth for closer inspection.\n\nNASA\u2019s Perseverance rover discovered leopard spot\u2013like features in this Martian rock (closeup image shown). On Earth, similar structures are associated with microbial life. MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASA\n\nSparking superconductivity\n\nLight may be the secret ingredient for making superconductors that don\u2019t require frigid conditions. In an experiment, blasting a copper and oxygen compound with a laser caused the material to throw off magnetic fields. That magnetism, the scientists say, is a smoking gun for superconductivity \u2014 the ability to ferry electricity with no resistance (SN: 8/10/24, p. 6). But skeptics contend that those magnetic fields might have arisen from some other, unknown physics.\n\nIn experiments, a compound made of copper and oxygen atoms (blue and red spheres in this illustration) blasted with laser light (red) threw off magnetic fields (blue). This effect signals that the compound transformed into a superconductor, some physicists say. Sebastian Fava, J\u00f6rg M. Harms\n\nAncient engineering\n\nBuilders used a water-powered elevator to construct Egypt\u2019s first pyramid nearly 4,700 years ago, researchers propose (SN: 9/7/24 & 9/21/24, p. 11). That controversial idea is based on a computer model of structures in and around the Step Pyramid of Djoser. Controlling the flow of floodwater in and out of a shaft inside the pyramid could have lifted and lowered a block-hoisting platform, the model shows. But critics argue that occasional rains wouldn\u2019t have supplied enough water to sustain such a system.\n\nAncient workers could have built Egyptian King Djoser\u2019s pyramid (shown) using a water-powered elevator to hoist the heavy stone blocks, a computer simulation suggests. But not all archaeologists are on board with the idea. Anton Petrus/Moment/Getty Images\n\nTectonic shake-up\n\nPlate tectonics got off to an early start in Earth\u2019s history, a rock in South Africa suggests. Layers in the rock bear scars of 3-billion-year-old landslides that may have been caused by an earthquake (SN: 4/6/24, p. 6). That quake, scientists say, could have been triggered by slabs of crust colliding. The finding lends support to the contested idea that plate tectonics dates back more than 2.8 billion years. But other geologists are not convinced that this quake marks the start of global plate tectonics.\n\nLayers of rock at the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa contain hints of a huge earthquake triggered by plate tectonics more than 3 billion years ago. Simon Lamb\n\nMedium size, maximum hype\n\nFor the first time, astronomers may have spotted a midsize black hole in our galaxy (SN: 8/10/24, p. 7). Telescope data suggest that a black hole at least 8,200 times as massive as the sun lurks in the star cluster Omega Centauri. But another study disputes the claim. Instead, the star cluster could harbor a horde of smaller black holes (SN: 8/20/24).\n\nIf a rare midsize black hole truly does lurk in the heart of the Omega Centauri star cluster, it would be the first black hole of its size found in the Milky Way. In this Hubble Space Telescope image, the supposed black hole\u2019s location is marked by the white box. Hubble/ESA, NASA, M. H\u00e4berle/MPIA\n\nTransmissible Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is not contagious in everyday life, but under extremely rare conditions, it may spread from one person to another (SN: 2/24/24, p. 6). Five people who in childhood received contaminated growth hormone injections later developed early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 most likely because the hormones were tainted with amyloid-beta, a protein whose buildup is linked to the disease, researchers say. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether the growth hormones are to blame, other experts note. Perhaps the health conditions that those hormones were meant to treat or other medical procedures led to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s in these patients.\n\nHigh levels of the protein amyloid-beta \u2014 a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 appear orange and purple in this brain scan of a man with the disease. Childhood exposure to the protein via contaminated growth hormone injections may have led the man to develop Alzheimer\u2019s later in life. G. Banerjee et al/Nature Medicine 2024\n\nShedding light on dark energy\n\nDark energy may have gotten even more mysterious. The enigmatic stuff, which makes up the bulk of the cosmos, is generally thought to maintain a constant density. But new observations of 6.4 million galaxies and quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, or DESI, paired with data on exploding stars, cast doubt on that idea. These data more closely fit a model of the universe in which the relationship between dark energy\u2019s density and its pressure changes over time (SN: 5/4/24 & 5/18/24, p. 6). If confirmed, this finding would rewrite the history of the universe. Experts are withholding judgment until DESI completes its survey of over 30 million other galaxies (SN: 12/14/24 & 12/28/24, p. 7)."

I\u2019m 17 and making deliveries in an underpowered Chevette with \u201c4-55\u201d air-conditioning (four open windows at 55 miles per hour), so I welcome the long runs to Sun City, when I can let desert air and American Top 40 blast through the car. Arrival, though, always gives me the creeps. The world\u2019s first \u201cactive retirement community\u201d is city-size (it would eventually span more than 14 square miles and house more than 40,000 people). The concentric circles of almost-identical tract houses stretch as far as I can see. Signs and bulletin boards announce limitless options for entertainment, shopping, fitness, tennis, golf, shuffleboard\u2014every kind of amenity.\n\nExplore the January 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nSun City is a retirement nirvana, a suburban dreamscape for a class of people who, only a generation before, were typically isolated, institutionalized, or crammed into their kids\u2019 overcrowded apartments. But I drive for blocks without seeing anyone jumping rope or playing tag (no children live here). I see no street life, unless you count residents driving golf carts, the preferred form of local transportation. My teenage self wonders: Is this twilight zone my eventual destiny? Is this what it means to be old, to be retired, in America?\n\nIn its day, Sun City represented a breakthrough in American life. When it opened, in 1960, thousands of people lined up their cars along Grand Avenue to gawk at the model homes. Del Webb, the visionary developer, understood that the United States was ready to imagine a whole new stage of life\u2014the golden years, as marketers proclaimed them.\n\nA cultural revolution was in full swing. Social Security and private pensions had liberated tens of millions of older Americans from poverty and dependency; modern medicine had given them the health to enjoy what was then a new lifestyle: leisure. In 1965, Medicare ameliorated the old-age fear of medical bankruptcy. In 1972, President Richard Nixon and the Democratic Congress, outbidding each other for the senior vote, increased Social Security by 20 percent and indexed it to keep up with inflation. With these two programs on fiscal autopilot, the entitlement state was born, and the elderly were its prime beneficiaries.\n\nWhen I gazed at Sun City, I was seeing the embodiment of the U.S. government\u2019s greatest 20th-century domestic achievement: the near elimination of destitution among the elderly. By 1977, the poverty rate among those 65 and older had fallen from almost 30 percent in the mid-1960s to half that level. In 2022, it was 10.9 percent, according to the Census Bureau, slightly below the poverty rate for those ages 18 to 64 (11.7 percent)\u2014and very significantly below the poverty rate among children and youth (16.3 percent).\n\n\u201cThe struggle chronicled in this book\u2014the struggle to build a secure old age for all\u2014has been in many ways successful,\u201d James Chappel writes in Golden Years: How Americans Invented and Reinvented Old Age. For most seniors, life is \u201cimmeasurably better\u201d than it was a century ago. But he and Andrew J. Scott, the author of The Longevity Imperative: How to Build a Healthier and More Productive Society to Support Our Longer Lives, agree that the \u201960s model of retirement needs updating in the face of new demographic, fiscal, and social realities. What comes next?\n\nLife expectancy at birth was 18 years in the early Bronze Age, 22 in the Roman empire, and 36 in Massachusetts in 1776.\n\nFor clues, Chappel, a historian at Duke University, looks to the past, tracing the 100-year evolution of Americans\u2019 notions of aging. He proceeds from the clarifying premise that aging is as much a social phenomenon as it is a biological one\u2014perhaps even more so. \u201cThere is no \u2018natural\u2019 way to age\u2014we have to be taught, by our cultural and political and religious institutions, how to do it well.\u201d\n\nFrom the December 2014 issue: Jonathan Rauch on the real roots of midlife crisis\n\nToday\u2019s conceptions of old age and retirement are modern inventions. In 19th-century America, Chappel writes, \u201cthe presumption was that \u2018old age\u2019 was not a long phase of life that began at sixty-five, but a short one that was marked by disability and decline \u2026 Basically, older people were to seek contemplation and tranquility.\u201d In the mid-1800s, the average 30-year-old could expect to live only about 30 more years. That began to change as the fruits of industrialization and science ripened. As more people lived to become old, social activists mobilized for pensions, led by Civil War veterans. Now forgotten, the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty, and Pension Association argued in the 1890s for pensions as a form of reparations for the formerly enslaved. No one today will be surprised to learn that this group was suppressed, its proposals were buried, and its leader, Callie House, found herself in jail on trumped-up charges.\n\nStill, the movement to end dependency and penury in old age gathered force and triumphed with the enactment of Social Security in 1935, the crowning achievement of the New Deal. Although its initial design favored men over women, white people over Black, and industrial over agricultural workers, it laid the foundation for the concept of retirement that made 65 officially old. Senior citizen replaced aged in the lexicon, and seniors became a self-aware identity group. The decades that followed brought rapid expansion of elder benefits and programs, and with it a far-flung social infrastructure: senior centers and retirement communities; continuous-care and assisted-living facilities; educational and recreational opportunities, such as Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes and Elderhostel (now Road Scholar); and, not least, AARP (originally the American Association of Retired Persons), a marketing juggernaut and among the largest and most powerful lobbying groups ever.\n\nBut today, Chappel argues, progress toward a healthier, more secure, and more inclusive concept of old age has stalled, largely because the U.S. government has stalled. Though private activism and inventive experiments continue, \u201cthey will always be insufficient in the absence of aggressive state action.\u201d A parsimonious Congress looks for budget cuts while conservatives push to privatize Social Security and Medicare. Just as worrisome, in Chappel\u2019s view: Older Americans have embraced the idea that they are the same as younger people, except older\u2014a vision that blurs the distinctive needs of elders and undercuts their identity-based activism. What\u2019s called for, he suggests, is an ambitious expansion of the welfare state to cover unmet necessities, such as long-term care.\n\nRead: The kind of smarts you don\u2019t find in young people\n\nThis raises some questions. For one, who will pay for expensive new government programs? Social Security and Medicare are rapidly headed for insolvency and already hold the rest of the federal budget in a tightening vise. \u201cThe entire long-term deficit growth is driven by Social Security, Medicare, and the interest cost of their shortfalls,\u201d Brian Riedl, a budget analyst with the Manhattan Institute, a center-right think tank, has written. Chappel breezes past any such fiscal concerns.\n\nEven more puzzling, he does not pause to consider why further subsidizing the elderly should be the country\u2019s top public-policy priority. He notes in passing that children are poorer than seniors, but he waves away the subject of generational equity, saying that \u201csecurity is not a scarce resource\u201d and dismissing as \u201cvicious\u201d a 1988 New Republic article, by the late Henry Fairlie, arguing that to seriously address competing social priorities, \u201cwe must shake off the peculiar notion \u2026 that old age is a time in which people are entitled to be rewarded.\u201d\n\nChappel is not a policy wonk; as history, his book is valuable and authoritative. Perhaps it is not a historian\u2019s job to answer philosophical questions about generational equity, political questions about hard choices, or fiscal questions about affordability. Still, one wishes he had at least teed them up, because they are unavoidable. Fortunately, Scott addresses them in The Longevity Imperative. An economist at London Business School, he identifies two longevity revolutions. The first has already arrived and, for all its multifaceted implications, is simply stated: Most people grow old.\n\nOf course, old age as such is not new, but until quite recently, comparatively few people lived to see it. Life expectancy at birth was 18 years in the early Bronze Age, 22 in the Roman empire, and 36 in Massachusetts in 1776. It\u2019s 77.5 years in the U.S. today, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Those averages include child mortality, which partly accounts for shorter lifespans in earlier epochs. Even excluding child mortality, though, the improvements in longevity are astounding. Since the 1880s, so-called best-practice life expectancy\u2014how long you\u2019ll live if you do everything right and receive good health care\u2014has increased, on average, by two to three years every decade. By now, the average American 65-year-old can expect to live another 18.5 years. Eighty is the new 68, inasmuch as the mortality rate of 80-year-old American women in 2019 was the same as that of 68-year-old women in 1933. An American child born today has a better-than-even chance of living to age 95. The first person to live to age 150 may have already been born.\n\nFrom the October 2014 issue: What happens when we all live to 100?\n\nYet that triumph poses a challenge. The first longevity revolution \u201cwas about getting the majority to reach old age; the second will be about changes in how we age,\u201d Scott writes. Will those additional years be vigorous and healthy? Or will they be filled with chronic illness and frailty? Will society capture the creative and productive potential of its rapidly expanding older population? Or will ageism and archaic conventions waste that potential? Scott makes an optimistic case that the second longevity revolution presents an opportunity to \u201crethink the way we live our whole life. Right now, though, we are not set to reap the benefit of these longer lives.\u201d\n\nThe core problem today, he argues, is that lifespan outruns health span. In other words, not all of the years we add are healthy ones. The time has come for an ambitious, all-of-society effort to close that gap. Health-care priorities should shift more toward prevention, which today receives only 3 percent of U.S. health-care spending. Public-health measures should help further reduce smoking, alcoholism, obesity, and social isolation. More research dollars should flow to slowing the biological aging process, as well as treating frailty and disease.\n\nThe second longevity revolution will also require new institutions, expectations, and attitudes. With millions of people living vigorously into their 80s and beyond, the very idea of \u201cretirement\u201d\u2014the expectation that people will leave the workforce at an arbitrary age\u2014makes no sense. In fact, out the window goes the whole three-stage structure of American life, with education crammed into the first couple of decades, work heaped in the middle, and leisure stuck at the end. Jobs need to be made more friendly to older workers (through measures as elaborate as shifting physical tasks to robots and as simple as providing different footwear and chairs); employers need to exploit age diversity (which improves team productivity by blending older workers\u2019 experience and skill with younger workers\u2019 creativity and drive); education and training need to be available and encouraged throughout life. \u201cThe key is to see aging as a state of flux involving us all and not an event or a state that segregates one group from another,\u201d Scott writes. Accordingly, he rejects the entire premise of age-based entitlements: \u201cTax breaks and other benefits should not be distributed simply because people reach a certain age.\u201d (Henry Fairlie, call your office!)\n\nSome of these changes are expensive, complex, or controversial, but Scott is right to argue that the really big barrier lies in American culture\u2019s relentless negativity about aging. \u201cDebate about an aging society rarely goes beyond mention of spiraling health costs, a pensions crisis, dementia and care homes,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt is never seen as exciting, challenging or interesting.\u201d\n\nReading Scott\u2019s book together with Chappel\u2019s can be whiplash-inducing, because they are in many respects antithetical. Where Chappel seeks to reinforce the country\u2019s commitment to retirement security, Scott challenges the very concept of retirement; where Chappel endorses age-based programs and politics, Scott wants to erase age boundaries and base policies on individuals\u2019 needs and abilities; and where Chappel sounds downbeat about aging in the United States\u2014emphasizing that \u201cmany older Americans are in trouble\u201d as they juggle the costs of medicine, housing, and especially long-term care\u2014Scott emphasizes the unprecedented opportunities that the longevity revolution affords.\n\nThere is truth in both authors\u2019 views (as they would probably agree). Supporting a rapidly growing aging population poses some daunting challenges, most notably in improving the country\u2019s fragmented provision of long-term care. Yet Scott\u2019s perspective is, I think, closer to the mark. The Sun City idea of aging and retirement is no longer either affordable or desirable as a template; viewing \u201cthe elderly\u201d as an identity category makes little sense at a time when living to 85 is commonplace and some 85-year-olds are as vigorous as many 65-year-olds. Now on the doorstep of routine 100-year lifespans, America needs to rethink the meaning of school, work, and retirement\u2014and what it even means to be old.\n\nRead: The future of work is a 60-year career\n\nI\u2019ll propose, however, a friendly amendment to Scott. He envisions a world where boundaries in life are decoupled from age; what matters is what you can do, not how old you are. But the big conceptual categories of childhood, adolescence, middle age, and old age are too deeply rooted to toss aside. We could use a new category, one reflecting the fact that longevity is inserting one, two, or even three decades between middle age and old age.\n\nAs it happens, such a category is available: late adulthood. Associated with such thinkers as the sociologist Phyllis Moen, the psychologist Laura Carstensen, the social entrepreneurs Chip Conley and Marc Freedman, and the activist and writer Ashton Applewhite, the notion of late adulthood captures the reality of a new stage of life, in which many people are neither fully retired nor conventionally employed\u2014a phase when people can seek new pursuits, take \u201cnot so hard\u201d jobs, and give back to their communities, their families, and their God.\n\nAnd no, this is not a pipe dream. Copious evidence shows that most of what people think they know about life after 50 is wrong. Aging per se (as distinct from sickness or frailty) is not a process of uniform decline. It brings gains, too: greater equanimity, more emotional resilience, and what Carstensen and others have called the positivity effect, a heightened appreciation of life\u2019s blessings. Partly for that reason, the later decades of life are, on average, not the saddest but the happiest. Contrary to popular belief, aging does not bring mental stagnation. Older people can learn and create, although their styles of learning and creativity are different than in younger years. Emotional development and maturation continue right through the end of life. And aging can bring wisdom\u2014the ability to rise above self-centered viewpoints, master turbulent emotions, and solve life\u2019s problems\u2014a boon not only to the wise but to everyone around them.\n\nRead: Caitlin Flanagan on turning 60\n\nLate adulthood is a time when the prospects for earning diminish but the potential for grandparenting, mentoring, and volunteering peaks. It is\u2014or can be\u2014a time of reorientation and relaunch, a time when zero-sum goals such as social competition and personal ambition yield to positive-sum pursuits such as building community and nurturing relationships.\n\nIf anything, Scott undersells the second longevity revolution. Right now, Americans are receiving more than a decade of additional time in the most satisfying and prosocial period of life. This is potentially the greatest gift any generation of humans has ever received. The question is whether we will grasp it.\n\nThis article appears in the January 2025 print edition with the headline \u201cThe Longevity Revolution.\u201d"
