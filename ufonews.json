            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nOver a span of several days last week, multiple sightings of UFOs were made in the Fresno, California area with no explanation ever revealed. A couple of the UFO sightings were even reported to the local airport tower by pilots.\n\nThe first UFO sighting occurred early in the morning when a light was recorded in the sky by a news tower camera just after 4 a.m. Fox 26 News reported that \u201cthe light appeared to hover over downtown Fresno.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you see that object move at the clip it moves and it\u2019s hovering again,\u201d said Earl Grey Anderson from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), who reviewed the footage. \u201cThat one I would probably actually give an unknown classification to which is a UFO.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I thought was very interesting about the second video is the clip. It suddenly moves. I\u2019m not sure what distance we\u2019re looking at there. It wasn\u2019t light speed or anything like that but that was awfully fast. You\u2019ve got an interesting capture there somebody saw what I would technically call a UFO.\u201d\n\nThe day after the initial UFO sighting, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara captured video of another UFO in the time, this time in broad daylight.\n\nThree days later, during the afternoon, a private pilot radioed the Fresno airport tower with a report of something unidentified in the sky. A second pilot reported an object following him at 3,500 feet.\n\nTower: \u201cYou saw something over downtown at 3,500?\u201d Pilot: \u201cCorrect. It looked like a white object.\u201d Tower: \u201cHow long was this?\u201d Pilot: \u201cI just lost it right now.\u201d\n\nSeveral other people in the area also reported taking video of similar objects in the sky at the time. Jeanette Herrera of Fresno reported seeing it on back-to-back days, and it\u2019s not the first time she has seen UFOs over the city.\n\n\u201cI saw that one video of the orb and I was like\u2026 well, wait a second. I\u2019ve got good video of these things,\u201d said Herrera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve filmed that particular orb at least three or four times in the last two weeks,\u201d Herrera continued, \u201cIt almost does this like firework thing where it blows up and then reappears in a different area. So, it just does that constantly and then sometimes it won\u2019t. It\u2019ll just stay like a little solid looking orb.\u201d\n\nA Fresno police helicopter, which investigated the one of the pilot\u2019s reports, and efforts to reach the Federal Aviation Administration in Fresno both proved fruitless for providing an explanation for the mysterious UFO sightings."

            "article_content": "The software world was rocked by statements from Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg during his appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast that AI could soon take over the work of middle level software engineers in his company.\n\nThe statement, coupled with Google chief Sundar Pichai\u2019s revelation last October that AI is already generating 25% of Google\u2019s code, marked a shocking shift in the software world.\n\nSoftware is now rapidly becoming a machine generated commodity.\n\nBut so much for big enterprise, what about the ordinary citizen in the street, how might this shift affect us? I decided to run a personal experiment, as a non-coding journalist with a long held ambition of creating software products.\n\nCould I turn this revolution to my advantage? How realistic would it be to assume that a complete novice like myself could create useful apps at the drop of a hat? Spoiler alert: very realistic!\n\nClaude and Bolt\n\nEarly last year we wrote about the impact of AI on the app market. It was clear even back then that things were changing fast. Two factors really cracked the market open for Joe Public programming. The first was the release of the Claude Sonnet 3.5 model from Anthropic, a model which excels in producing great code from text prompts.\n\nThe second was the release of the open source product Bolt.new, an app which took the Claude model and wrapped it in an easy-to-use interface. Now everyone and their grandmother could code an app, as long as they could type an English sentence.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

As well as Bolt, I tested out numerous products which entered the market over this period. This includes products like Tempo, Pythagora, Marblism, Github Spark and WindSurf. They all offered various levels of ease of use, but in the end I always returned to Bolt and a Windows app called CodeCompanion, because of price, flexibility and ease of use.\n\nThe result is I\u2019ve created more than 15 different software applications over the past few months. These are not Earth-shattering apps, they\u2019re just basic tools I use on a regular basis and which I though it would be cool to make. It\u2019s like eating out at a restaurant, it\u2019s nice, but how much more satisfying to create your own special dish at home, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\n\nThe apps range from basic utilities like an image background remover, a QR code creator and news feed reader, to a clever little inventory app which lets me point my phone camera at a shelf of books and use AI to create an instant catalog of the titles and authors in a formatted spreadsheet file.\n\nAn interesting result from this experiment is the fact that, even though I\u2019m still a million miles away from being a real programmer, I\u2019ve learned a huge amount about the process of creating apps.\n\nWhat I learned \u2014 top tips for getting started\n\nSimple is best\n\nDrop all ambitions to create a new Facebook or eBay, AI is nowhere near good enough for that right now. If you have some programming experience, you can definitely build quite elaborate applications with shopping baskets and suchlike.\n\nBut if you\u2019re a newcomer I suggest you start with something like a to-do list app, learn how the process works, and slowly lead up to more complex projects. It will save you grief, and money too.\n\nBe prepared to study\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nRight now the reality of AI coding is you\u2019ll still need some basic tech experience if you\u2019re going to produce anything in a decent amount of time and budget.\n\nBy that I mean familiarize yourself with how file structures work on a disc, how databases work, and things like user authentication, and generally have a basic level knowledge of computers.\n\nEasy, flexible deployment is key\n\nThe best micro app in the world is useless unless it\u2019s deployed and available for use.\n\nMany of the AI coding products either lock you into a specific track by which you have to deploy to their server system, or they leave you to do all that work. One of the things I like most about Bolt is the one click deploy to Netlify.com. Your app is instantly available to the world.\n\nClaude is boss\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nThere\u2019s still just one, expensive, model maestro.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled, behind 99.9% of all these AI coding products is one key component \u2014 the Claude Sonnet 3.5 AI model. Claude remains the absolute emperor of coding.\n\nBy all means test out models like Deepseek V3, or Gemini 2.0, or OpenAI if you can. But at the end of the day I can almost guarantee you\u2019ll return to Claude to do anything serious. And I say that knowing that Sonnet is not cheap.\n\nLearn the limitations\n\nThe best way to save your sanity and your money, is to learn the limitations of the AI process. Experiment with the tools, note where they struggle and shine, and remember to save your work often.\n\nI use a combination of Bolt.new and Bolt.diy (which is the current open source version of Bolt). I can test out my ideas with the DIY version using free and ultra cheap models. Then when I\u2019m happy I can move on to the commercial Bolt.new coder with Sonnet as the engine.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe bottom line is, yes it is absolutely possible for a novice to code up modest apps using the new tools. However there is a minimum level of computing expertise you need, and the more you have the better your results will be.\n\nFinally it\u2019s worth saying that we\u2019re still very much at the foothills of this tech. The AI models are getting better by the day, the tools are improving at the same rate, and by this time next year the sector will be at a whole new level of sophistication."

            "article_content": "Steven Soderbergh has never made a horror movie, and certainly not of the ghostly, haunted variety. His movies tend to be exacting, precise, so even when they\u2019re frightening, as with the stalker nightmare Unsane or the chilling disease thriller Contagion, that fear comes from witnessing a process failing with just as much efficiency as when it succeeds. Death, as depicted in his new horror thriller Presence, has no such clarity of success and failure. The sense of loss left behind feels like a kind of failure, yet it is both inevitable and unknowable. These are some of the mysteries eating away at teenage Chloe (Callina Liang), who has just lost her best friend Nadia to a drug overdose and is now moving into a new house with her semi-functional family.\n\nYes, it\u2019s the old something-not-quite-right-with-this-house-that\u2019s-supposed-to-solve-everything business: Chloe feels shivers of offness in her new home, which concerns her sweet-natured but frustrated father Chris (Chris Sullivan) and mostly annoys her jock brother Tyler (Eddy Maday)\u2014who is the clear favorite of distracted mother Rebecca (Lucy Liu), further bedeviled by some vague but obviously Soderberghian financial malfeasance at work. As far as Rebecca is concerned, that\u2019s the issue that should require discussion in hushed tones, not the creaks and chills of otherness that Chloe feels. Is it Nadia, Chloe wonders? Or just, as her parents assume, an expression of her grief and loneliness?\n\nThe identity question may linger, but there\u2019s no fake suspense over whether Chloe is imagining things. To depict this haunting, Soderbergh imposes a system onto a spiritual dimension where none should necessarily exist: He shoots the entire movie from the point of view of an unseen spirit that does indeed drift through the house; \u201cpresence\u201d is also, essentially, the title character. It\u2019s a Paranormal Activity movie turned inside-out: Rather than a largely stationary camera capturing flickers of spooky but eerily realistic movement in the frame, the camera remains mobile and hovering, its ghostliness an invisible but driving force. Like the Paranormal films, there is an element of surveillance: The camera travels through rooms unnoticed, overhearing bits of conversation and observing actions kept secret from other characters. It\u2019s at once omniscient and deeply subjective. There\u2019s also another technical challenge on hand for Soderbergh, who has professed far more affinity for the cut than the epically long take: to stay true to his POV gimmick, most scenes are staged in single unbroken shots. Cuts move forward in time, not within a scene.\n\nThe simultaneous braininess and gimmickry of this technique, applied to a David Koepp screenplay that unapologetically eschews A Ghost Story-style metaphysical traversing, could have stranded Presence in a liminal zone between shlock and airless experiment. What Soderbergh winds up achieving is more reminiscent of his throwback crime pictures, like the Criss Cross remake The Underneath or more recent thrillers like the period noir No Sudden Move and the intensely Early 2020s Kimi. That is to say that Presence has the story, limited scope, and 85-minute runtime of a 1940s B-picture, infused\u2014as those pictures often were, and as his crime movies usually are\u2014with a disciplined style and contemporary electricity. It\u2019s budget Gothic that\u2019s worth every penny and then some.\n\nIn that context, it\u2019s less surprising that Soderbergh didn\u2019t recruit anyone from his ever-growing unofficial rep company for this cast: No Matt Damon as the dad, no Catherine Zeta-Jones as the mom, no Riley Keough as a cool aunt dropping by. (Julia Fox, however, does have one scene as a real-estate agent. No word on whether she\u2019s bumpin\u2019 that.) The central quartet playing the family all does wonderful work, and in a movie with several talented young performers, frequent stage/TV/character actor Sullivan feels like the belated discovery as the flustered but loving father. The familial relationships that Soderbergh and Koepp set up aren\u2019t necessarily wide-ranging or unpredictable, but as Presence ticks toward an inevitable confrontation, they\u2019re surprisingly involving. There\u2019s a circularity to Presence that is both entirely in keeping with a haunted-house story and, in this telling, even moving. It\u2019s yet another genre that Soderbergh has worked like a problem, and produced an elegant solution.\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nWriter: David Koepp\n\nStarring: Callina Liang, Chris Sullivan, Lucy Liu, Eddy Maday, Julia Fox\n\nRelease Date: January 24, 2025"

            "article_content": "Lucy, I know that you have a son. Did you draw on anything from your personal life for your portrayal of a \u201cboy mom\u201d?\n\nLiu: It\u2019s funny\u2014I didn\u2019t, because [Tyler] was in a very different age range. I just worked off of [David Koepp\u2019s] script because it was all there. It was hard because she\u2019s not necessarily a character that is really easy to understand; there\u2019s a lot of mystery and smoke. There are a lot of secrets, and I love that David doesn\u2019t reveal them, even at the end. You never find out what happened with her work, with her husband, with the lawyer. In some ways, that backstory is a little bit of a MacGuffin. Everything shifts into something much more intangible\u2014emotions of grief and loss and what that does to a person. It opens her up and creates this huge cavern for something else, something that\u2019s not about getting ahead in her work life or her son\u2019s life.\n\nIt\u2019s usually only in films specifically about the Asian American experience that you see an Asian American family. I\u2019m curious if it felt liberating, in some way, to focus purely on the dynamic of a mother and daughter and the themes of the movie without racial identity being a focus.\n\nLiang: A hundred percent. The entire time you were asking that question, I thought, Absolutely. It was very freeing for me to, just once, be cast in something that had nothing [to do with] race. It was nothing about what I looked like, but it was just, simply, you are this person, you\u2019re in a house, you\u2019re experiencing ghost stuff, you\u2019re struggling with your family. Like, just be a girl. Obviously, in the industry, a lot of progress has already been made, but there\u2019s a lot of progress [still] to be made. A lot of tokenism and things like that still happen.\n\nLiu: It\u2019s such a long road. There\u2019s this constant feeling that they\u2019re including somebody for diversity\u2019s sake, like picking one person from each [race or ethnicity] and throwing them in there, or there\u2019s only one role that can be diverse. God forbid, there\u2019s more than one role! It didn\u2019t cross my mind at first because I think Steven was really the focal point, calling me to this whole project. But now that you mention it, I\u2019m seeing, of course, it was such a relief to not have to think about that. It\u2019s not a highlight\u2014it\u2019s just a given."

From on-campus adventures to dazzling talks to \u201cscience night out\u201d events at locations around Texas, the program has a wide range of offerings for all ages.\n\n\u201cAs a public university, our mission extends beyond our work in classrooms and labs \u2013 it also means engaging with the community and having big conversations around scientific themes like artificial intelligence, space exploration, health, the environment and STEM success for a new generation,\u201d said David Vanden Bout, dean of UT\u2019s College of Natural Sciences. \u201cThe Texas Science Festival creates a space for shared exchange and discovery. It helps build bridges between our broader community and the experiences of wonder and excitement that are inherent in science.\u201d\n\nParticipants of all ages are invited to engage with a variety of hot topics in science, get their questions answered and enjoy learning how the world works at participating events. Coordinated program includes longstanding UT events that draw thousands \u2013 like the family-friendly annual STEM Girl Day on Feb. 22 \u2013 to newer, more focused offerings, such as an astronomy talk at a local winery, targeting those 21 and over. This year\u2019s festival theme, \u201cFusing Curiosity with Discovery,\u201d speaks to the wide-ranging program, which kicks off with two events pertaining to science and food and concludes with three days of special sessions related to AI and robotics.\n\nSponsored by The University of Texas at Austin, the festival has events coordinated with two dozen partner organizations. New events continue to be added to the schedule, featuring speakers and presenters including leading scientists, authors, innovators, artists and experts, such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Donna Strickland, professional mountaineer Ed Viesturs and award-winning film director Ian Cheney. The festival\u2019s various performances, panels, screenings and social events explore everything from pathways into science to awe-inspiring phenomena like black holes. Some events provide practical insights into areas like maintaining brain health, navigating the possibilities of new technologies and understanding the implications for homeowners of changing weather in Texas. Participants will also have opportunities to hear about a wide range of interesting subjects: what humans can learn from chimpanzees, how Indigenous people\u2019s knowledge of plants can be useful today and how AI is changing the process of writing and human expression.\n\nNew this year to the Texas Science Festival are:\n\nA series of events about the connections between science and art: Musical Memories: An Evening of Music and Science; aqueous, a dance performance coordinated by Planet Texas 2050 at Waller Creek exploring ecological resilience and conservation concerns; The Science of Modern and Contemporary Public Art Preservation: A Walking Tour showcasing nature- and science-inspired Landmarks art on campus; and several events where winners of UT\u2019s Visualizing Science contest will be on display.\n\nSeveral events billed \u201cScience Night Out,\u201d where in partnership with local film and art organizations, pubs, breweries and wineries, science topics will take center stage, making for an engaging night on the town.\n\nA coordinated collaboration with Texas Robotics, UT\u2019s Machine Learning Lab and the Amazon Science Hub in the last days of the festival will bring together industry stakeholders, academics and community members to learn about the rapid changes happening in AI and robotics.\n\nAstronomy discussions, both live and online, where attendees will learn about subjects like planetary discoveries and exploring Mars, with a NASA Johnson Space Center expert and experts from UT\u2019s McDonald Observatory.\n\nThe Texas Science Festival was launched virtually in 2021, and a hybrid version of the festival was held in 2023. With a few exceptions for events that require tickets, 2025 festival events are free, though space is limited. To learn more, explore options and sign up to attend, visit sciencefest.utexas.edu."

Going forward, when OpenAI seeks additional capacity, Microsoft will have the \"right of first refusal\" before OpenAI checks with other parties.\n\nThe change in their relationship was disclosed as part of President Donald Trump's announcement of the Stargate Project, a joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank to invest billions of dollars in AI infrastructure in the U.S. Executives from those companies committed to invest an initial $100 billion and up to $500 billion over the next four years in the project, which will be set up as a separate company.\n\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox. Sign up for NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nOracle is a \"key initial technology partner\" alongside Arm, Microsoft and Nvidia in setting up data center infrastructure, OpenAI said in a blog post.\n\n\"The data centers are actually under construction,\" Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said at a press conference at the White House, alongside Trump. \"The first of them are under construction in Texas. Each building is a half a million square feet. There are 10 buildings currently being built, but that will expand to 20 and other locations beyond the Abilene location, which is, which is our first location.\"\n\nOracle shares jumped 7% on Tuesday.\n\nIn 2019, three years before the launch of ChatGPT, Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI, which committed to moving its services to Azure. As OpenAI's computing needs expanded, Microsoft signed contracts with third-party cloud providers, such as CoreWeave, to supplement its Azure cloud infrastructure.\n\nOracle entered the mix last year. The database software maker, which trails Amazon, Microsoft and Google in the cloud market, said in June that Microsoft's Azure AI platform would be extended to Oracle's cloud.\n\nOpenAI said on Tuesday that it will continue to increase consumption of Azure, and Microsoft said OpenAI recently made \"a new, large Azure commitment\" for products and model training. Microsoft still has rights to OpenAI's intellectual property, which can go in products such as Copilot. And it still has the exclusive on supplying computing requests for OpenAI's application programming interface.\n\nBut the relationship has shown signs of strain, and Microsoft named OpenAI as a competitor in July. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella talked about OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's big ambitions on a podcast with investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley that was released in December.\n\n\"What he wants to do, I have to accommodate for, so that he can do what he does,\" Nadella said. \"And he needs to accommodate for the discipline that we need on our end, given the overall constraints that we may have.\"\n\nWATCH: President Trump speaks on AI infrastructure investment"

It allows programmers to chat with an AI assistant while coding and generate code snippets or write project-level code based on natural language prompts.\n\nThe tool's AI features are powered by either OpenAI's GPT-4o or Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and these features are currently free to use. The user interface supports English and Chinese, as many overseas programmers are from China. The company has not mentioned whether it plans to support additional languages.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe program has launched on Apple's macOS and a version for Microsoft Windows is in the works, according to the website. The software is distributed by ByteDance's Singapore-based subsidiary Spring (SG) Pte, the company behind its Cici chatbot that launched in 2023.\n\nByteDance's Trae is a fork of Microsoft's popular Visual Studio Code.

The software is built on Electron, a cross-platform framework that uses web standards based on Google's Chromium.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shared underlying technology means ByteDance can \"directly migrate plug-ins and settings\", and the familiar interface allows developers to quickly get started, according to Chinese tech blogger XixiaoyaoQAQ, who published a review on WeChat.\n\nTrae \"makes programming more accessible to the public so you can personally build projects from scratch, even if you have no development experience, no knowledge of code, or even English\", the blogger wrote.\n\nXixiaoyaoQAQ tested Trae by asking it to design and code a casual game that might be popular during the coming Lunar New Year holiday. The system generated a plain-looking but playable game in which users receive fortunes falling from the top of the screen.\n\nByteDance's new project comes after Big Tech rival Alibaba Group Holding earlier this month launched its own AI coding assistant. The e-commerce and cloud computing firm touts its Tongyi Lingma as capable of building an application \"in minutes\".\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe system is powered by Alibaba Cloud's Tongyi Qianwen family of large language models - the technology behind generative AI services like ChatGPT - and improves the efficiency of code development by a factor of 10, according to the company. On Tuesday, Alibaba Cloud announced that the system can now access its latest Qwen2.5 model.\n\nAlibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

            "article_content": "In September, Verseon, a pioneering company in physics- and AI-powered drug discovery, revealed that its AI technology significantly outperforms Google\u2019s cutting-edge Deep Learning models in terms of prediction accuracy for a wide range of datasets. Just a month later, the company announced a breakthrough in combining multiple AI models in dynamic ways. And most recently, they\u2019ve shown that their AI platform, VersAI\u2122, trains models 3,000 times faster than Google AutoML on standard benchmark datasets.\n\nSo, how are they pulling this off?\n\nThe answer lies in their proprietary VersAI\u2122 technology.\n\nUnlike most AI companies \u2013 which rely on off-the-shelf AI tools from giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI \u2013 Verseon has built its own proprietary AI technology from the ground up. These other companies primarily use Deep Learning frameworks that depend on vast amounts of high-quality training data to function properly. \u201cBig Data\u201d in the form of billions of web pages is available to train large language models, and in the form of millions of transactions for specific products to train models that make personalized shopping recommendations. But in most AI use cases, large, dense datasets like those are hard to come by.\n\nFor most real-world applications, the available datasets are small and sparse. This poses a significant challenge for traditional Deep Learning. Most AI companies today struggle to gather enough high-quality data to build reliable models for their intended applications.\n\nAs Guang-Bin Huang, a professor at NTU in Singapore and one of the lead authors of a landmark AI paper, points out, \u201cWhile deep learning excels in certain applications, it\u2019s not the best approach for small or sparse datasets. In these cases, its performance can be severely limited.\u201d\n\nVerseon, however, has developed an entirely new AI architecture that is specifically designed to handle small, sparse datasets \u2013 the kind that are common in many real-world applications, including drug discovery.\n\nWhat Makes VersAI\u2122 Different from Deep Learning?\n\nThe key difference lies in the neural network structure. In any AI system, the neural network is composed of input nodes (where data enters), hidden nodes (which process the data), and output nodes (where the results are produced).\n\nDeep Learning uses a monolithic neural network with multiple hidden layers to process data. The more complex the data, the more layers are required, and each additional layer adds significant computational overhead. As a result, training these models is slow and resource-intensive.\n\nVersAI\u2122, by contrast, takes a fundamentally different approach. As Verseon\u2019s Ed Ratner describes, \u201cUnlike Deep Learning AI, VersAI uses a completely novel and proprietary neural \u2018network of networks\u2019 architecture.\u201d Instead of using one large network with many layers, VersAI\u2122 uses multiple smaller, independent neural networks, each with a single hidden layer. These networks process the data in parallel, and then their outputs are dynamically weighted and combined to generate a final result. This method substantially reduces the error rate in predictions for small and sparse datasets. And it also consistently reduces model-training times regardless of the size or density of the training dataset.\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nDeep Learning models become dramatically more complicated and slower as the size and complexity of training data increase, leading to longer training times and consequent delays in building deployable models. In contrast, VersAI\u2019s 3,000 times faster training allows building models in near real time \u2013 a virtue critical in applications like ecommerce where trends can change fast.\n\nThis training time advantage also leads to much lower deployment costs. The reduced computational intensity of training models in VersAI\u2122 relative to Deep Learning not only requires less costly computer hardware, but it also uses far less electricity. In short, VersAI\u2122 is much greener AI.\n\nA Pharma Company Revolutionizing AI\n\nIt\u2019s truly remarkable that a pharmaceutical company is at the forefront of developing fundamental new AI technology that outperforms industry titans like Google, Meta, and OpenAI \u2013 particularly when it comes to handling the small, sparse datasets that are common in real-world applications. And the potential of VersAI\u2122 extends far beyond drug discovery. Given its impressive performance so far, this innovative technology could have a transformative impact on the reliability and effectiveness of AI across many consumer, science, and business applications, improving the way AI is used in our everyday lives."

It really is a lot of information! Where does it all go?\n\nWith free services, we all know how the saying goes, \u201cIf the product is free, you\u2019re the product.\u201d Even legitimate products will sell your data or have massive data leaks, with your personal info hitting data sites one way or another.\n\nPersonal responsibility, double-checking each site we sign up for, and keeping abreast of the latest tech news are all ways we can protect ourselves. But, we can also use Incogni \u2014 a service that removes your personal info from data brokers and people search sites \u2014 to help us on our path to having more control over the data that makes us, us.\n\nIncogni works on your behalf to seek out sources of your data, from people search sites to data banks that include everything from your personal interests to your job history, and remove them. From handling requests to following up and, eventually, sending that second notice out just in case your information has trickled back into the system, Incogni makes getting to the bottom of the problem easy. And the best part? Right now you can get Incogni\u2019s annual plan for 55% less than use. Just tap the button below and use code DIGITALDEAL upon checkout to get started."

            "article_content": "Rupay Credit Card on UPI\n\nCustomers using RuPay credit cards linked to UPI do 40 transactions per month average, eight times higher than traditional credit card users, according to an analysis done by RuPay credit card fintech Kiwi.\n\nThe higher frequency helped RuPay corner a 12 percent market share for card transaction volume in 2024, compared to the three percent the payment network had in 2023, the Kiwi report said.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nBoth RuPay and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) are run by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). UPI is the country\u2019s most popular digital payment method cornering around 85 percent of all such transactions.\n\nRuPay is a domestic card network that competes with global giants Visa and Mastercard. Only RuPay cards are allowed to be linked to UPI as per the regulations.\n\nThe cumulative monthly transaction value of RuPay is around Rs 14,000 crore, while the overall credit card network value is around Rs 1.8 lakh crore, which translates into a 7.5 percent market share in value.\n\nAround two-thirds of all RuPay credit card transactions happen through UPI. A year ago, RuPay was doing around Rs 10,000 worth of transactions in a month, of which 50 percent came through UPI.\n\nWhile RuPay is the most successful debit card platform with more than 80 percent of the market share in cards issued, it trails Visa and Mastercard in credit cards, where the spending is much higher. However, with the linking of RuPay credit cards with UPI, the platform has now cornered a 25 percent market share in new credit cards issued in the country. There are around 10.5 crore active credit cards in the country as per the Reserve Bank of India data.\n\nHowever, RuPay network's popularity has been surging over the last year as customers get the best of credit card rewards with the convenience and reach of UPI. While there are only 9o lakh card-accepting merchants, there are an estimated 32 crore UPI merchants.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nRuPay credit card spending is growing at 5 percent monthly, reaching an average of Rs 40,000 per user, according to data available with Kiwi. The company, one of the early adopters of virtual RuPay credit cards linked to UPI, enables co-branded RuPay credit cards with Axis Bank and Yes Bank. Kiwi has raised a little less than $20 million until now and does around Rs 300 crore worth of transactions in a month.\n\nHowever, the average transaction value is Rs 1,100, much lower compared to Visa and Mastercard, where the average transaction value is around Rs 4,000. This is mostly because the cards are still mostly used for daily small-value payments, where the customers earlier used to pay with UPI.\n\n\u201cUPI-enabled credit cards are transforming how millions of Indians engage with credit, By combining the convenience and widespread acceptance of UPI with the power of credit, we are seeing a new wave of financial inclusion. This empowers individuals with more responsible, accessible, and transparent financial tools, driving a shift towards smarter spending habits and responsible credit usage,\u201d says Mohit Bedi, cofounder of Kiwi.\n\nThis surge is benefiting local retailers and small merchants, with 75 percent of transactions being conducted at grocery shops and other small businesses in the country.\n\nDue to a high merchant discount rate \u2013 or the commission that merchants pay to card issuing banks and payment providers \u2013 most small merchants are reluctant to accept credit cards. On the other hand, merchants using RuPay credit cards on UPI are charged fees only for transactions exceeding Rs 2,000, making them particularly attractive to small businesses that previously avoided credit cards. RuPay had also faced some resistance from merchants in the past.\n\nMost credit card users have more than one credit card and customers are increasingly opting for virtual RuPay credit cards as their second or third, with 50 percent of these cards being digital ones. They are also more popular with younger customers with around 45 percent of users in the under 30 age group, and another 30 percent of users between ages 31 and 40.\n\nThe rise of RuPay has been helped by the regulatory diktats. Last year, RBI mandated all card issuers (mostly banks) to offer consumers the option to choose their card network when applying for a new credit card or when renewing their credit cards. This ended the decades-old way of banks entering into exclusive agreements with Visa and Mastercard. In August, NPCI also directed banks to ensure RuPay credit cardholders receive rewards on par with other networks.\n\nRuPay\u2019s growing foothold in the domestic credit card market is particularly significant as geopolitical tensions highlight the importance of domestic payment systems. The recent exclusion of Russian payment systems from global networks like Visa and Mastercard has underscored the need for nations to develop independent solutions.\n\nNPCI is working with several countries to develop a similar domestic card network. It is also entering into bilateral partnerships with other countries that will enable international RuPay card payments without the help of other card networks."

It is also in \u201cactive talks\u201d with Blinkit and others to bring a complete range of Acer products \u2013 including laptops, monitors, tablets and accessories \u2013 to quick commerce.\n\n\u201cWe are confident of this channel for long-term growth. Quick commerce players are actively solving challenges related to inventory management and last-mile delivery for high valued Items like laptops, tablets, and other electronic items,\u201d said Sudhir Goel, Chief Business Officer Acer India.\n\nLaptops are the latest development in the ongoing strategy of quick commerce firms to deliver big-ticket products. Electronic gadgets like smartphones and laptops drive up average order values (AOVs), which in turn fuels margin improvements for quick commerce platforms. In fact, Blinkit, on January 22, announced a partnership with Xiaomi and Nokia to expand its smartphone category beyond iPhones.\n\nTesting the waters\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nWhile firms like HP and Acer have started selling laptops, other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are testing the waters by listing accessories like keyboards, mice, and printers, to gauge initial demand.\n\nTaiwanese PC manufacturer Asus, for instance, announced a partnership with Zepto last week to list a range of accessories, including keyboards and mice, on the platform, made available in major cities like Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru.\n\n\u201cWe also plan to expand its presence on other quick commerce platforms such as Blinkit and Instamart further broadening our reach and ensuring greater accessibility for consumers across India,\u201d said Arnold Su, Vice President, Consumer and Gaming PC, System Business Group, Asus.\n\nLenovo, India\u2019s second-largest PC marker, is adopting a similar approach of listing smaller tech accessories. It is, however, seeing sales gradually pick up for larger ticket items. Its products are currently available on Blinkit.\n\n\u201cCurrently, on Zepto, our Lenovo Tab M11 is the most purchased tablet and we\u2019re optimistic about scaling this channel further to enhance accessibility and convenience for our customers,\u201d said Dinesh Nair, Director of Consumer Business, Lenovo India.\n\nNew growth channel\n\nIndia\u2019s traditional PC market (inclusive of desktops, notebooks, and workstations) shipped an all-time high of 4.49 million units in the third quarter of calendar year 2024, up 0.1 percent year-over-year (YoY), amid the festival season last year, according to a report by the International Data Corporation (IDC).\n\nHP led the market with a share of 29 percent, followed by Lenovo and Dell Technologies with a market share of 17.3 percent and 14.6 percent, respectively. The Acer Group occupied the fourth spot at 14.6 percent again, with Asus rounding out the top five at 9.7 percent, the report showed.\n\nAs the country\u2019s PC market continues to grow, India's $5.5 billion quick commerce market is emerging as the next phase of online growth for many PC manufacturers.\n\n\u201cWe believe quick commerce is the future of e-commerce and offers us a new avenue to expand our reach and serve more customers,\u201d said Su.\n\nAccording to the Asus executive, traditional e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon have not been able to meet the growing need for faster deliveries, and quick commerce has emerged as a channel that can complement existing online platforms.\n\n\u201cWhile some may perceive quick commerce as a threat to established online players, we view it as an opportunity to reach a niche customer base in need of products beyond just daily groceries or FMCG items,\u201d he said.\n\nFor other OEMs, it is still early days and quick commerce is currently just another channel that they want to expand their presence to.\n\n\u201cAs a brand, our focus remains on serving our customers across all platforms\u2014whether it\u2019s through offline retail stores, online and e-commerce channels, or emerging quick commerce solutions. By embracing innovative distribution models, we are ensuring that our customers can access HP products wherever and whenever they need them,\u201d said HP\u2019s Gehani.\n\nEarly days for laptops on quick commerce\n\nWhether laptops take off in a big way via quick commerce remains to be seen. Analysts tracking the sector expect the category to make up a small share of quick commerce sales for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cIt will require considerable effort to scale the laptop and PC category on quick commerce. Sales in this category are expected to remain between 2-3 percent in the medium term,\u201d said an internet sector analyst.\n\nRegardless, PC makers are of the view that quick commerce players with strong execution will be able to drive sales, as demand for high-value electronics on quick commerce continues to rise.\n\n\u201cThis depends on how quick commerce players are going to solve the need for a larger selection for buyers along with the convenience of delivery in 10-30 minutes,\u201d said Goel."

            "article_content": "Sharing Data Makes Every Agency Stronger\n\nIn the realm of public safety and security, the integration of open architecture surveillance systems promises to significantly enhance interagency collaboration and operational efficiency.\n\nOpen architecture surveillance dissolves traditional barriers of proprietary systems, enabling a seamless flow of information among public sector entities, including law enforcement, emergency services, municipal administrations and even private sector organizations.\n\nThe collaborations that stem from these central, shared insights foster a unified approach to public safety that helps all factions involved do more with less. This, in turn, augments the collective capacity to respond to emergencies, manage resources and ensure safer cities.\n\nRELATED: Law enforcement agencies and utilities will digitize physical security in 2025.\n\nData-Driven Decision-Making Enhances Law Enforcement Outcomes\n\nIn 2019, law enforcement in Canada deployed a real-time intelligent center that integrates various streams of information, including live surveillance footage from stationary or body-worn cameras, social media monitoring, actionable insights, data analytics and other intelligence sources. This stream of data provides law enforcement officers with improved awareness into ongoing incidents and potential threats.\n\nBeyond law enforcement, these centers often support broader public safety efforts, including emergency response coordination, disaster management and event security planning. For example, officers can work with other units, government entities and private organizations to centrally access aggregated event video feeds, data analytics and intelligence that may indicate emerging threats or criminal activities. This allows for a swift and unified response to incidents, where personnel are better equipped and directed where they are most needed.\n\nWith open architecture, surveillance systems shift toward interoperability and flexibility, and devices such as sensors, infrared cameras and even lighting controls can all run on the same communication protocol.\n\nIn the U.S., Project Green Light Detroit similarly uses open architecture and seamless collaboration between public and private entities. The Detroit Police Department initiated the project in 2016, partnering with eight gas stations equipped with real-time camera connections to police headquarters. The innovative public-private community partnership enhances neighborhood safety, supports local businesses and strengthens crime prevention efforts.\n\nOver the years, participants have installed high-definition cameras, upgraded network connections and improved lighting on their properties. The police department and the city provide staff to monitor and analyze video feeds in the real-time crime center.\n\nLEARN MORE: Moving physical security to the cloud boosts efficiency.\n\nSharing Resources Yields a Reduced Environmental Impact\n\nAnother key benefit of open architecture systems is that they allow multiple agencies to share surveillance infrastructure and data, reducing the need for each entity to deploy its own hardware. This collaborative approach can decrease the environmental impact associated with manufacturing, operating and disposing of electronic surveillance equipment. Open architecture systems also allow for the use of cloud-based services and more efficient data centers, which consume less energy compared with traditional, decentralized systems.\n\nOpen architecture systems are also inherently flexible and scalable, allowing for easier updates and integration of new technologies without complete system overhauls. For example, you can add features such as network speakers to improve communication and even provide verbal warnings to deter certain behaviors. Network intercoms can provide audiovisual identification and remote entry control.\n\nOther examples might include body-worn solutions for private security and law enforcement, analytics to improve operator efficiency, radar to follow intruders, and even strobe sirens for safety and deterrence.\n\nLater expansion of the systems would make it possible to extend the lifespan of existing infrastructure while reducing waste and demand for new materials.\n\nDIVE DEEPER: State and local governments can build data centers sustainably.\n\nCost Sharing Minimizes Expenditures\n\nThe collaborative nature of open architecture surveillance allows for cost sharing among participating units, government agencies and organizations. This can include shared expenses for acquisition, maintenance and upgrades. The net results of cost sharing include significant savings and more efficient use of public funds.\n\nAgencies and entities that buy in will ultimately experience a higher ROI. They can integrate and upgrade systems as needed without replacing entire setups, which helps ensure that investments remain valuable over a longer period, further contributing to economic sustainability.\n\nIn the end, public agencies and law enforcement can optimize their use of available resources through the sharing of surveillance data and open architecture systems. This leads to more efficient deployment of personnel and equipment, further reducing unnecessary expenditures and environmental impact.\n\nAdhering to Privacy and Data Protection Requirements\n\nWhile the benefits are substantial, the implementation of open architecture surveillance systems is not without challenges; in particular, privacy, data protection and cybersecurity need to be placed front and center to safeguard all data in transit among agencies and other entities, and at rest.\n\nNevertheless, the transition to open architecture surveillance systems represents a forward-thinking approach to public sector operations and safety. By overcoming the limitations of siloed, proprietary systems, agencies can enhance their collaborative efforts, operational efficiency and, ultimately, their service to the community.\n\nWith that in mind, this transition requires a commitment to technological innovation, but the principles of privacy, security and ethical governance must remain priorities. As we move forward, the main goal should remain leveraging technology to serve the public good, ensuring safer, more secure and united cities and towns.\n\nUP NEXT: Cybersecurity mesh strengthens security for state and local governments."

            "article_content": "With the advent of Zero Trust architecture, where the principle of \u201cnever trust, always verify\u201d prevails, the importance of comprehensive access control has never been more pronounced. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, organizations are turning to advanced access control mechanisms to safeguard their sensitive data and assets.\n\nUnified Access Control (UAC) is at the forefront of this movement, enhancing enterprise security through three foundational pillars: Simplicity, Automation, and Insight. By embracing UAC, organizations can fortify their defenses, streamline security processes, and gain unparalleled visibility into their security landscape.\n\nWhat is Unified Access Control?\n\nUnified Access Control (UAC) is a comprehensive security framework designed to manage and enforce access policies across an organization\u2019s entire digital environment. UAC provides robust access control capabilities for enterprise networks, applications, and infrastructure, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can access critical resources.\n\nKey technologies that make up UAC include:\n\nNetwork Access Control (NAC), which governs access to network resources based on predefined security policies;\n\nConditional Access, which applies contextual rules to determine user access to specific SaaS and on-premises applications based on factors such as user role, device health, and location; and\n\nTACACS+, a protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting for managing network devices and ensuring secure access to network infrastructure.\n\nTogether, these capabilities deliver a unified and cohesive approach to access control, significantly enhancing the security posture of enterprise environments.\n\nPillar #1 of UAC is Simplicity: Reducing User Friction & Enhancing Experience\n\nOne of the primary challenges in enterprise security is balancing robust protection with a seamless user experience. Traditional security measures often involve complex passwords, multifactor authentication, and cumbersome access protocols, which can frustrate users and hinder productivity. UAC addresses this challenge by embracing simplicity, making security both effective and user-friendly.\n\nPasswordless Authentication\n\nPasswordless authentication is at the forefront of UAC\u2019s simplicity pillar. By eliminating the need for traditional passwords, UAC reduces the risk of password-related breaches, which are a common entry point for cyber attackers. Instead, users can leverage biometrics, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, or hardware tokens for secure access. This not only enhances security but also streamlines the user experience, allowing employees to access the resources they need with minimal friction.\n\nCloud-Native Architecture\n\nAdopting a cloud-native architecture is another critical aspect of UAC\u2019s simplicity. Cloud-native solutions offer scalability, flexibility, and ease of integration, enabling organizations to deploy and manage their access control systems with greater efficiency. By leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, UAC can be seamlessly integrated with existing enterprise systems, providing a unified platform for managing access across various applications and environments.\n\nSeamless Integration\n\nSeamless integration is essential for reducing complexity in access control. UAC solutions are designed to work harmoniously with existing security frameworks and applications, minimizing disruption and ensuring a smooth transition. This integration capability allows organizations to consolidate their security measures into a single, cohesive system, enhancing both security and operational efficiency.\n\nPillar #2 of UAC is Automation: Streamlining Security Processes & Response\n\nIn the realm of enterprise security, automation is a game-changer. By automating routine security tasks and responses, UAC enables organizations to enhance their security posture while reducing the burden on IT and security teams. Automation ensures that security measures are consistently applied, reducing the risk of human error and enabling faster, more effective responses to threats.\n\nUser Segmentation\n\nUser segmentation is a key component of UAC\u2019s automation capabilities. By categorizing users based on roles, departments, or risk profiles, UAC can apply tailored security policies that align with each user\u2019s specific needs and risk level. This segmentation allows for granular control over access permissions, ensuring that users only have access to the resources necessary for their roles while minimizing the attack surface.\n\nDevice Remediation\n\nAutomation in UAC also extends to device remediation. With the proliferation of mobile and remote work, managing and securing a diverse array of devices is a significant challenge. UAC solutions can automatically detect and remediate devices that do not comply with security policies, such as those lacking the latest updates or running unauthorized applications. This proactive approach ensures that only secure, compliant devices can access the network, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.\n\nAutomated Device Onboarding\n\nSelf-onboarding capabilities further streamline the security process. By allowing users to self-register their devices and configure them according to security policies, UAC reduces the administrative overhead on IT teams. Automated onboarding processes ensure that devices are properly configured and secure from the outset, enhancing overall security and user satisfaction.\n\nPillar #3 of UAC is Insight: Providing Comprehensive Visibility and Control\n\nIn the modern threat landscape, visibility and control are paramount. UAC provides organizations with deep insights into their security posture, enabling proactive threat management and informed decision-making. By continuously monitoring and assessing risks, UAC ensures that security measures are both dynamic and adaptive.\n\nContinuous Risk Assessment\n\nContinuous risk assessment is a critical component of UAC\u2019s insight pillar. By constantly evaluating user behavior, device health, and network activity, UAC can identify potential threats in real-time. This ongoing assessment allows for dynamic adjustments to security policies, ensuring that the organization remains protected against emerging threats. Continuous monitoring also provides a comprehensive view of the security landscape, enabling faster detection and response to incidents.\n\nDevice Profiling\n\nDevice profiling enhances visibility by creating detailed profiles of all devices accessing the network. These profiles include information on device type, operating system, compliance status, and usage patterns. By maintaining up-to-date profiles, UAC can identify anomalies and potential security risks associated with specific devices. This granular level of detail enables organizations to implement targeted security measures and mitigate risks more effectively.\n\nRole- and Location-Based Access\n\nRole- and location-based access control further enhances security by aligning access permissions with specific user roles and geographical locations. UAC can enforce access policies based on the user\u2019s role within the organization and their physical location, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized personnel in appropriate contexts. This contextual approach to access control minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.\n\nUAC Represents a Paradigm Shift in Security\n\nUnified Access Control is more than just a security solution; it is a strategic approach to safeguarding enterprise assets in an increasingly complex digital environment. By leveraging the three pillars of Simplicity, Automation, and Insight, UAC transforms traditional access control into a dynamic, adaptive, and comprehensive security framework.\n\nUnified Access Control represents a paradigm shift in enterprise security. By embracing simplicity, automation, and insight, organizations can enhance their security posture, reduce vulnerabilities, and achieve a higher level of protection for their valuable assets. UAC is not just about managing access; it is about creating a secure, resilient, and adaptive security environment that can keep pace with the evolving threat landscape.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDenny LeCompte, the CEO of Portnox, is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations and strategic direction of the company.

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nThe Sydney funnel-web spider is the most venomous in the world. This scientists already knew since it has 13 people have been reported to have been killed by it. What some Australian scientists didn\u2019t know, but recently discovered, is that there are actually three species of Sydney funnel-web spiders and the one they nicknamed the \u201cNewcastle big boy\u201d is the largest ever seen in Australia and the deadliest spider in the world.\n\nIn new research published in the journal BMC Ecology and Evolution, scientists from the Australian Museum, Flinders University and Germany\u2019s Leibniz Institute found that the 3.54-inch-long species Atrax christenseni is actually distinct from the \u201cclassic\u201d Sydney funnel-web (Atrax robustus) and the Southern Sydney funnel-web (Atrax montanus).\n\n\u201cWhen our international team of researchers \u2018reopened the case\u2019 on the Sydney funnel-web, we looked at fine morphological details and gene sequences across the region and found the species split into three distinct groups,\u201d said Dr. Helen Smith, an arachnologist at the Australian Museum.\n\n\u201cThe Newcastle funnel-web, Atrax christenseni \u2013 dubbed Big Boy \u2013 is a totally new species. The \u2018true\u2019 Sydney Funnel-web, Atrax robustus centers on the North Shore of Sydney and the Central Coast, and the Southern Sydney Funnel-web, Atrax montanus, is a resurrected species name from 1914,\u201d said lead researcher, Dr. Stephanie Loria of the Leibniz Institute.\n\nAccording to Live Science\u2026\n\nCalled funnel-web spiders after their long, narrow, silk-lined burrows these spiders can live in suburban areas and wander into houses during the summer when males leave the burrow to search for mates. Their venom contains a toxin that attacks the human nervous system, so bites need immediate medical attention \u2014 otherwise, a victim can die within 15 minutes.\n\nThe Sydney funnel-web spider\u2019s venom, which contains potent neurotoxins, can cause numbness in the mouth, profuse sweating and salivation, muscle spasms, difficulty breathing, confusion and disorientation, tachycardia, and in at least 13 cases, death. Its venom, according to ZME Science, \u201cis often compared to the venom of other deadly creatures such as the box jellyfish and inland taipan.\u201d\n\nThe good news, besides the scientific discovery, of course, is that there have been no human deaths attributed to Sydney funnel-web spiders since an antivenom was introduced in the 1980s. Funnel-web spiders are also not aggressive in nature, but will attack if they feel cornered.\n\n\u201cYou would think that a spider like that had been studied to death\u2026 because it\u2019s so relevant. There\u2019s practical relevance because people get bitten each year,\u201d Danilo Harms, co-author of the study and an arachnologist at the University of Gottingen in Germany, told Live Science. \u201cFinding that very little had been done, looking into the very basic stuff you\u2019d want to know, was surprising.\u201d"

In the photo, Zuckerberg was seen with colleagues celebrating Meta\u2019s first retail store opening in Burlingame, California. Social media users couldn\u2019t get past Zuckerberg\u2019s peculiar facial expression, which seemed oddly frozen and lacked what people called \u2018Human emotions.\u2019\n\nMark Zuckerberg\u2019s fake alien picture is getting viral.

Zuckerberg\u2019s wide-eyed stare, rigid posture, and calculated responses during hours of questioning left viewers convinced he wasn\u2019t just nervous\u2014he might actually be a bot.\n\nMemes began circulating with captions like, \u201cWhen Mark bleeds, it\u2019s engine oil,\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s not updating software fast enough.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg himself fueled the fire when, in a 2014 Q&A session, he famously remarked, \u201cI am human. still,\u201d a statement that was meant to be self-deprecating but instead sounded eerily like an alien trying to blend in.\n\nBeyond being a supposed humanoid, Zuckerberg has long been the target of the \u201clizard people\u201d conspiracy\u2014a tongue-in-cheek theory suggesting he\u2019s a reptilian alien masquerading as a human. The rumors gained traction during his congressional hearing in 2018 when his unblinking gaze and awkward demeanor became meme fodder. Theories about contact lenses hiding his \u201ctrue reptilian eyes\u201d have since become a running joke online.\n\nIt might sound strange, but Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, has started to embrace the \u201calien robot\u201d image that many people have joked about. Recently, he has been making an effort to appear more likable and \u2018human-like\u2019 in public. He\u2019s been training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, surfing with a flag on shore, and even cracking jokes on podcasts.\n\nHowever, some trolls on social media believe these efforts feel fake. They argue that his casual clothes and new hobbies don\u2019t match with his polished, almost too-perfect public image. Everything Zuckerberg does\u2014like his social media posts or his serious appearance at events\u2014seems carefully planned and not very natural.\n\nALSO READ: Mark Zuckerberg Does It Again, Likes Lauren Sanchez\u2019s Insta Pic After Viral \u2018Staring\u2019 Incident"

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nOver a span of several days last week, multiple sightings of UFOs were made in the Fresno, California area with no explanation ever revealed. A couple of the UFO sightings were even reported to the local airport tower by pilots.\n\nThe first UFO sighting occurred early in the morning when a light was recorded in the sky by a news tower camera just after 4 a.m. Fox 26 News reported that \u201cthe light appeared to hover over downtown Fresno.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you see that object move at the clip it moves and it\u2019s hovering again,\u201d said Earl Grey Anderson from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), who reviewed the footage. \u201cThat one I would probably actually give an unknown classification to which is a UFO.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I thought was very interesting about the second video is the clip. It suddenly moves. I\u2019m not sure what distance we\u2019re looking at there. It wasn\u2019t light speed or anything like that but that was awfully fast. You\u2019ve got an interesting capture there somebody saw what I would technically call a UFO.\u201d\n\nThe day after the initial UFO sighting, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara captured video of another UFO in the time, this time in broad daylight.\n\nThree days later, during the afternoon, a private pilot radioed the Fresno airport tower with a report of something unidentified in the sky. A second pilot reported an object following him at 3,500 feet.\n\nTower: \u201cYou saw something over downtown at 3,500?\u201d Pilot: \u201cCorrect. It looked like a white object.\u201d Tower: \u201cHow long was this?\u201d Pilot: \u201cI just lost it right now.\u201d\n\nSeveral other people in the area also reported taking video of similar objects in the sky at the time. Jeanette Herrera of Fresno reported seeing it on back-to-back days, and it\u2019s not the first time she has seen UFOs over the city.\n\n\u201cI saw that one video of the orb and I was like\u2026 well, wait a second. I\u2019ve got good video of these things,\u201d said Herrera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve filmed that particular orb at least three or four times in the last two weeks,\u201d Herrera continued, \u201cIt almost does this like firework thing where it blows up and then reappears in a different area. So, it just does that constantly and then sometimes it won\u2019t. It\u2019ll just stay like a little solid looking orb.\u201d\n\nA Fresno police helicopter, which investigated the one of the pilot\u2019s reports, and efforts to reach the Federal Aviation Administration in Fresno both proved fruitless for providing an explanation for the mysterious UFO sightings."

            "article_content": "A decade ago humanity launched around 200 objects into space per year. Now we launch more than 2,600, with no prospects for slowing down. This rapid expansion of human activity in outer space has filled Earth orbit with space trash, from dead satellites to used-up rocket parts. The region is already so crowded that working satellites run the risk of colliding with bits of garbage from previous generations of spacecraft. Even the International Space Station often has to adjust its orbit to dodge debris.\n\nCurrently there are more than 25,000 pieces of trackable human-made junk larger than 10 centimeters orbiting Earth. The more we put up there, the greater the chance that pieces of debris (traveling at relative speeds up to 15 times faster than a bullet) will strike working spacecraft, creating even more dangerous trash. The catastrophic collision in 2009 between the defunct Russian satellite Cosmos 2251 and the operational Iridium satellite, for example, generated nearly 2,000 debris fragments, many of which are still being tracked today.\n\nOrbital space is a finite resource, and it\u2019s rapidly being consumed by a few organizations, notably SpaceX, OneWeb and Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper. SpaceX, for instance, owns and operates the majority of all working satellites, and the company aims to launch tens of thousands more satellites to provide global broadband Internet coverage. Similarly, Amazon plans to deploy 3,236 satellites for its broadband network.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nGiving everyone unfettered access without global coordination and planning means that eventually no one may be able to use it.\n\nIf we keep up this pace, orbital space will become unusable\u2014especially the most popular region, low Earth orbit (LEO), which extends up to 2,000 kilometers in altitude. When looking at all orbital regions, we may lose services we\u2019ve come to rely on: continuous communications, GPS mapping, Internet, Earth monitoring, and more. Today nearly every satellite that is launched is equivalent to a piece of single-use plastic, in that its fate is to become detritus. We are heading toward a tragedy of the commons in orbital space: giving everyone unfettered access without global coordination and planning means that eventually no one may be able to use it.\n\nAs we continue to push the boundaries of space exploration and commercialization, there is a growing movement to rethink our approach to using the space environment\u2014to move to a strategy anchored in stewardship and sound waste-management principles. I believe we must leave behind our \u201clinear space economy,\u201d where we use and abandon, and move toward a \u201ccircular space economy\u201d\u2014a sustainable way to use space that emphasizes the reuse, recycling, and efficient management of space resources.\n\nJust as we are reckoning with how to conserve ecosystems on Earth for future living creatures, we must think of space as an environment worthy of preservation. In fact, reforming how we operate in space is critical for Earth conservation.\n\nThe production, launch and operation of satellites and rockets consume vast amounts of resources and energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. Rocket launches release pollutants into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, soot and aluminum oxides, which cause atmospheric damage and contribute to climate change.\n\nMoreover, the practice of uncontrolled reentries, where defunct satellites and rocket stages are allowed to burn up in the atmosphere, adds to atmospheric pollution and creates the risk of debris falling on people and property on Earth. In 2024, for instance, pieces of a SpaceX Dragon service module, including one about the size of a standard car hood, landed in the mountains of North Carolina, and a castoff part of the International Space Station fell through the roof of a house in Naples, Fla.\n\nThe ClearSpace-1 mission is due to launch in 2025 to rendezvous with a piece of a Vega rocket. This illustration shows ClearSpace-1 capturing the debris with robotic arms. The mission will aim to drag the rocket part down to burn up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. ClearSpace SA\n\nA circular space economy would represent a paradigm shift toward sustainable space practices, drawing inspiration from circular economy ideas that are gaining traction here on Earth. \u201cCircularity\u201d in this sense refers to waste-management principles calling for the end of life of a product to be designed for the object\u2019s reuse or recycling. The first step is to design spacecraft using materials that minimize pollution and generate less waste. The second is to repair satellites\u2019 broken parts in orbit to extend their life cycles. The third is to recycle materials from defunct satellites for use on new missions, without having to bring the satellites back to Earth. And finally, we must retrieve and reprocess space debris to reduce collision risks and reclaim valuable components.\n\nWe won\u2019t be able to enact a circular space economy without some technological innovations. We don\u2019t currently have techniques to service all spacecraft in orbit, although several companies and space agencies are working on it. We must create technology to extend satellites\u2019 operational lifespans and reduce the need for costly and resource-intensive replacement missions. We need spacecraft that can approach aging satellites and dock with them, using robots to repair, refuel and upgrade them.\n\nSpace exploration also raises fundamental ethical questions about fair resource extraction, ownership and environmental stewardship.\n\nWe\u2019ll also need a way to reuse and recycle satellites when their working lives are over. Currently all satellites become trash when their primary mission ends, and new satellites are built from entirely new materials. It\u2019s a huge waste, much like our junkyards for used cars and other vehicles. Researchers are working on ways to harvest materials from dead spacecraft to integrate into new vehicles and to use techniques to build new satellites out of used parts.\n\nA positive step in this direction is the reusable rocket technology SpaceX is developing. The boosters of their Falcon 9 rockets, for instance, can land vertically after being jettisoned in space after launch, allowing them to fly again. Not only does this save money\u2014recycling boosters reduces the cost of each Falcon 9 launch by up to 30 percent\u2014it generates less trash. But so far SpaceX is the only company or agency launching satellites with reusable rockets. We need more.\n\nThere\u2019s also been movement toward servicing working satellites in orbit. Northrop Grumman\u2019s SpaceLogistics has developed a spacecraft, the Mission Extension Vehicle (MEV), to help aging satellites keep going. In 2020 it successfully docked with the Intelsat 901 satellite, which was running out of fuel, and began using its own thrusters and propellant to maneuver the joined craft, extending the Intelsat\u2019s operational life. A second MEV docked with another Intelsat spacecraft in 2021. When those satellites are ready to be retired, the MEVs can undock and move on to other spacecraft that need their help. Launching an MEV to aid an ailing craft costs about half to a quarter of the price of building and launching an entirely new satellite. In addition to saving money, in-\u00adorbit servicing reduces the frequency of new satellite launches, which in turn minimizes the accumulation of space debris and the greenhouse gas emissions that come with rocket launches.\n\nRemoving debris from orbit is another challenge. Different types of trash require different removal techniques, with many ideas coming from the fishing industry: some strategies use nets, others harpoons, and still others hooks. Each removal technology has limitations and works only for a subset of the objects that need to be fished out of orbital space. It\u2019s also really expensive to retrieve any kind of space trash because anything that is not being actively controlled in space is tumbling. This means that to grab something to remove it, you must either find a way to steady the space detritus or make your debris-removal satellite tumble along with it. Detumbling debris takes a lot of energy, which results in high propellant costs.\n\nJen Christiansen; Source: \u201cSatellite Statistics: Satellite and Debris Population,\u201d Jonathan\u2019s Space Report (data)\n\nNevertheless, some progress has been made. In 2021 a Tokyo-based company, Astroscale, ran the End-\u00adof-\u00adLife Services by Astroscale demonstration (ELSA-d) mission, which launched two satellites: one to simulate a dead spacecraft and a servicer satellite to remove it. The two craft successfully docked in orbit and then released, testing out a critical process for eventual debris removal. The company plans to run more tests with its Active Debris Removal by Astro\u00adscale-\u00adJapan (ADRAS-J) mission, which launched in 2024.\n\nThe European Space Agency (ESA), partnering with start-up ClearSpace, is set to launch its ClearSpace-1 mission in 2028. ClearSpace-1 will use four robotic arms to grab onto the agency\u2019s PROBA-1 satellite and bring it safely out of orbit. The project aims not only to clean up space but also to develop the ability to target larger and more complex pieces of debris.\n\nFinally, more efficient propulsion technology allows spacecraft to use less fuel and last longer on their initial load. Electric propulsion systems, such as ion thrusters and Hall effect thrusters, are newer technologies that offer higher efficiency and fuel economy compared with traditional chemical propulsion. These systems use electric power to ionize propellant and generate thrust, enabling spacecraft to achieve higher velocities and perform precise maneuvers over extended periods. Electric propulsion is already used by many working satellites and will become increasingly common.\n\nAs we design new technology to conserve space, we\u2019d do well to take inspiration from another kind of tech: Indigenous societies\u2019 traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). This kind of TEK emphasizes the importance of harmonious relationships between human activities and the environment. It shows us that we have to see space as an extension of our natural world, where resources must be managed wisely and responsibly.\n\nAn example of applying TEK ideas to modern space activities is a recent collaboration between the ESA and Indigenous groups in Australia to study the impacts of space debris on wildlife habitats. By respecting the wisdom of Indigenous communities, ESA not only advanced their scientific goals but also promoted a sustainable model that can be applied to future space missions.\n\nNew technology alone isn\u2019t enough to fix the space junk problem\u2014we\u2019ll need legal reform, too. The current global space policy is a patchwork of regulations that often lag behind technological advancements and the evolving needs of space activities. SpaceX, for instance, has faced regulatory challenges in deploying its reusable rockets because our laws haven\u2019t caught up with the technology. Fragmented regulations across different countries and regions also lead to inconsistencies and hinder international collaboration. And many existing space policies don\u2019t even address sustainable practices such as in-orbit servicing, space debris mitigation and responsible resource use.\n\nThe European Union is trying to pave the way by integrating sustainability principles into its space policies. The E.U. has streamlined licensing processes for satellite launches and in-orbit operations across member states and has allocated significant funding for research and development on dealing with space debris. The U.S., through its many government agencies, has begun working to streamline the licensing process as well. But most countries are dangerously far behind.\n\nGovernments have a strong hand to play in incentivizing companies to design and develop sustainable space systems. One way to do this would be to adopt what are called extended producer responsibility laws, which require companies to help manage the waste from the technology they produce. Perhaps governments could use a credit system to regulate the amount of space debris the industry is allowed to create. Laws could also incentivize the design, launch and operation of on-orbit recycling centers where aging and defunct satellites could be repurposed.\n\nUltimately the governments that permit spacecraft to be launched are liable for any damage their space objects may cause. So the responsibility for cleaning orbital space falls to governments, but none of them, including Russia, the U.S. or China, are establishing robust markets for space garbage pickup and removal services. Moreover, currently there is no legal mechanism to transfer this liability for damage from one launching state to another, making it complicated to put in place a space salvage law analogous to maritime policy. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space also plays a pivotal role in developing international space law and norms. Its Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines encourage member states to manage space debris and promote sustainable space operations. More than 100 countries have endorsed the guidelines, including the U.S. Yet guidelines are not enforceable laws in and of themselves\u2014they are merely suggestions.\n\nSpace exploration also raises fundamental ethical questions about fair resource extraction, ownership and environmental stewardship. Asteroid mining, for example, presents opportunities for accessing rare minerals and resources, although it also risks destroying the scientific and cultural heritage of celestial bodies. And space mining could destabilize global markets\u2014imagine mining an asteroid made out of platinum. Furthermore, who should be allowed to profit from the resources of asteroids\u2014is it fair for only certain countries, or certain billionaires, to grow even richer and more powerful from space commodities?\n\nOrganizations such as the International Institute of Space Law and the U.N. Office for Outer Space Affairs are trying to develop ethical guidelines for responsible ways to use space resources that emphasize transparency, international cooperation and sustainability. Initiatives such as the Space Sustainability Rating, which aims to certify space missions based on sustainable practices, could encourage companies and nations to act responsibly.\n\nPreserving the space environment for future generations is a moral imperative. In the short term, we must take immediate action to deal with the growing dangers of space junk. We need more funding for debris-tracking and debris-mitigation technologies. We must also start changing how we build and use satellites to waste fewer resources, produce less trash and pollution, and recycle more. A circular space economy is the only way to keep space usable indefinitely.\n\nIn the long term, fostering international cooperation\u2014and international treaties requiring sustainable space practices\u2014is critical. The Inter-\u00adAgency Space Debris Coordination Committee, an intergovernmental organization dedicated to combating the problem of orbital trash, is a promising step. Many space agencies, including NASA, China\u2019s National Space Administration and Roscosmos, are members. The ESA\u2019s Clean Space initiative is another smart approach to reducing space debris through technology development and policy changes.\n\nThe establishment of a circular space economy is not just an option but a necessity for the sustainable future of space exploration. By adopting the principles of reuse, recycling, and efficient resource management, we can lower the risks of space debris collisions, preserve resources, and ensure that outer space remains a viable domain for scientific discovery and commercial innovation. Policymakers, industry leaders, scientists and the global community must embrace a sustainable approach to our activities in Earth orbit, securing its potential for generations to come."
