        "article_content": "Many a horror franchise has been temporarily goosed by an injection of sci-fi \u2014 even the slasher at the center of the \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d series went into orbit in the 2001 \u201cJason X\u201d \u2014 but that element doesn\u2019t do a lot to distinguish \u201cV/H/S/Beyond.\u201d This seventh entry in the ersatz found-footage omnibus series should be another reliable draw for genre platform Shudder, where it begins streaming Oct. 4. And the ongoing overall enterprise continues to have value as a launching pad for up-and-coming talents. But despite its new thematic wrinkle, the five segments here feel familiar in ideas and unmemorable in execution. It\u2019s a middling addition to a variably inspired anthology brand that will no doubt trundle on through more installments yet.\n\nThe wraparound device, directed by Canadian documentarian Jay Cheel, mingles interviews with real-life UFO enthusiasts and skeptics, also throwing in passing mentions of highlights in the history of alleged abductions, plus clips from popular representations (including vintage drive-in camp \u201cEarth vs. the Flying Saucers\u201d). There\u2019s also a fictive element in discussing a man\u2019s disappearance from his family\u2019s home, leaving behind VHS tapes of a supposed \u201calien encounter\u201d that we finally see at the film\u2019s end.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe first three regular sequences are a little too alike, in that they all escalate quickly to frenzied, bloody action confused by the found-footage subgenre\u2019s usual hectic first-person camerawork. In Jordan Downey\u2019s \u201cStork,\u201d a squad of police raid a dilapidated house amid rampant baby kidnappings. Before finding what they\u2019re looking for, they must battle adults who\u2019ve basically turned into fast-moving zombies. Virit Pal\u2019s \u201cDream Girl\u201d has two paparazzi (Syandeep Sengupta and Rohan Joshi) sneaking onto a Mumbai film set, then into the trailer of \u201csuperstar Tara\u201d (Namrata Sheth) to snap some \u201ccandids.\u201d Alas, they discover a little too much about her, leading to another gory melee. Justin Martinez\u2019s \u201cLive and Let Dive\u201d finds skittish Zach (Bobby Slaski) coerced into skydiving with friends to mark his 30th birthday. Unfortunately, their plane gets caught between an alien spaceship and pursuing government aircraft, with the survivors facing related new perils once they\u2019ve crash-landed in an orchard below.\n\nEach is a bit better than the last, but these splattery scenarios nonetheless feel like the same thing in different settings \u2014 preliminary jitters, then carnage and monsters \u2014 only somewhat alleviated by the novelty of \u201cStork\u201d\u2019s surreal climactic attic tableau, \u201cGirl\u201d\u2019s Bollywood musical number, or \u201cDive\u201d\u2019s alarming creature design.\n\nThere is definitely a shift in approach with siblings Christian and Justin Long\u2019s \u201cFur Babies,\u201d but this more comedic miniature is also the collection\u2019s worst episode. Libby Letlow plays the gratingly chirpy proprietress for \u201cDoggy Dreamhouse,\u201d a canine boarding facility some animal rights activists suspect of being abusive. But when they send members incognito to spy on her, it turns out her harshest \u201ctraining\u201d is largely reserved for two-legged captives. Though it eventually tips towards silliness of a \u201cIsland of Dr. Moreau\u201d-esque stripe, the intended satire here of both simpering pet pamperers and PETA-style fanatics is painfully broad.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s actor Kate Siegel\u2019s latest collaboration with spouse Mike Flanagan, this one her first as director, while he is the writer. (They previously co-wrote the screenplay for his very good 2016 feature \u201cHush,\u201d in which she starred.) That definitely ups the expectations for \u201cStowaway,\u201d a slow burn with Alanah Pearce as Halley, a woman interviewing locals around \u201cknown UFO hotspot\u201d the Mohave Desert for a documentary \u2014 though whether she\u2019s sincerely interested or secretly ridiculing them, we\u2019re not sure.\n\nFlanagan\u2019s script offers this \u201cV/H/S\u201d entry\u2019s only stab at character nuance by hinting that our heroine arrived at this isolated place and task by having already burned every other bridge in her life. In any case, camping out one night, she investigates unusual lights in the distance, ultimately entering some kind of alien craft. But just what happens to her there is so murkily visualized (in sharpest contrast to the arguably over-sharp bodycam imagery in \u201cStork\u201d) that the segment just kind of floats off into fuzzy obscurity. Intriguing and frustrating in the general realm of \u201cSkinamarink\u201d\u2019s twilight-zone dread, it requires patience yet doesn\u2019t quite go anywhere definite enough to reward that effort fully.\n\nThe found-footage format can grow repetitious fast, and too much of \u201cBeyond\u201d degenerates into chaotic chase/attack set-pieces that feel interchangeable in their shaky cams and barely coherent action. The energy is high \u2026 but high energy can get monotonous, too. Actors running around screaming aren\u2019t all that effective (or convincing, as supposedly \u201creal\u201d people filming themselves) sans sufficient setup in terms of character involvement, ominous atmosphere or narrative engagement. While the individual conceits here are workable enough \u2014 even if two of them really have no connection to the ostensible UFO theme \u2014 nearly all head toward variations on the same shrill bloodbath, suggesting future \u201cV/H/S\u201d chapters might do better to re-focus on inventive writing rather than simply providing disparate excuses for gory mayhem.\n\nThat said, this competent if mostly forgettable effort\u2019s strongest elements are in exactly that department. Though their handiwork is often glimpsed too briefly, special makeup effects designer Patrick Magee and VFX supervisor Justin Martinez (both credited for the entire feature) contribute some vividly icky, grotesque images."

        "article_content": "Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, \u2018CTRL\u2019 revolves around Nella Awasthi, a popular content creator whose social media relationship with her boyfriend, Joe Mascarenhas, comes to an end after she catches him cheating on her. Subsequently, Nella installs an AI app named CTRL that helps her erase Joe from her digital life. However, unbeknownst to her, the app takes rapid control over every aspect of her life, blurring the lines between reality and the virtual world.\n\nThe Netflix thriller presents a cerebral film that latches on to growing concerns within the modernizing digital world. With data, social media, and personal privacy colliding within the screenlife drama\u2019s plot, a grave and chilling account is presented with unflinching authenticity. It asks valid questions about individual awareness, the practices of the dark web, and how invasive technology can be when left unchecked and employed as a commodity. Therefore, the film\u2019s basis seems tied to prescient issues of the contemporary world and the reality faced by everyone with access to the internet. But is that really the case?\n\nCTRL Sheds Light on the Dark Side of Social Media\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 is a fictional story penned by director Vikramaditya Motwane and co-writers Avinash Sampath and Sumukhi Suresh. The movie explores the pitfalls of social media culture through a gripping thriller storyline, punctuating it with incisive forays into the internet\u2019s toxic elements. While the story begins in a relatively happy place, it takes a slow descent into the issues plaguing ordinary people in relation to their digital interactions. Probing questions about authenticity are posed as the protagonist, Nella, finds herself living a lie in front of the camera but leading a completely different one offscreen. Additionally, the darkest aspects of the narrative come to the fore when an invasive AI begins exploiting the insecurities of human emotions through its own agendas.\n\nThe movie mainly examines the exploitative nature of social media and how memory, human emotion, and feelings can often get tied in a virtual setting, which often has no borders on its privacy. As people yearn for more, Nella finds herself catering to their needs by becoming the face of perfection but lacking the imperfections needed to sell reality. Director Vikramaditya stated that the film revolves around the concept of sharing oneself with the world without understanding the consequences that come from it. He explained, \u201cIt\u2019s all about \u2013 how much sharing is too much sharing and the dopamine hits likes and favourites give you. It\u2019s about how much you end up doing for social media. It\u2019s like a doomsday scenario and it\u2019s not impossible to believe this.\u201d\n\nCTRL is a Topical Thriller About the Commodification of Human Experience\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 derives most of its central tension from the battle between human free will and an authoritarian AI app that wants to dictate everything for its users. There is an Orwellian fantasy lurking in its premise. Parallels can be seen with how rapidly modernizing internet practices attempt to take away control from people\u2019s lives, particularly in the manner in which it preys on insecurities. It serves as the burning question of the film. Even Ananya Pandey, who plays Nella, chimed in on the topical concern by emphasizing how it can be particularly damaging for mostly the younger generation, who find themselves victim to a lot of seedy online elements and the mental challenges they pose at times.\n\nMemory also plays a major role in \u2018CTRL.\u2019 With most people\u2019s lives today stored in digital archives, a person\u2019s memories can be attached to their social media avatar. In the movie, this becomes a central topic and one that was inspired by other films. During the development process, the scriptwriters discussed the enduring legacy of \u2018Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u2019 as a key influence, particularly in the manner in which it explores erasing a loved one from one\u2019s life. The same concept rears its head throughout the Netflix screenlife thriller. The director also revealed that the Spike Jonze-directed science fiction movie, \u2018Her,\u2019 had some influence over the writing. However, he hailed the Michel Gondry directorial as a masterpiece, even if it does not touch upon the topic of AI.\n\nThe Ctrl App is a Fictional AI Service With an Invasive Protocol\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 is built around the futuristic service provided by the titular AI app that Nella installs on her laptop, which eventually takes control over her life. It is a made-up application conceived by the scriptwriters Vikramaditya Motwane, Avinash Sampath, and Sumukhi Suresh. While it is not based on any real-life apps, Vikramaditya stated that it would serve as an interesting reflection of how AI has become a major hot-button issue in today\u2019s society. \u201cGiven the conversations about AI, we realized that there was a lot more that we could say about social media, data and privacy in the guide of a straightforward thriller,\u201d the director said. As such, some vague parallels can be drawn between the CTRL app and chatbot AIs like ChatGPT, especially how it is capable of mimicking natural human dialogue.\n\nHowever, in terms of the app\u2019s personalized aspects, digital assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa have more similarities. The story focuses primarily on the CTRL app\u2019s invasive nature and how it eventually takes over Nella\u2019s life and dictates every aspect, including her schedule and emotional needs. In many ways, it also provides an outlet for people to alleviate their loneliness, which is a prime concern in the case of Nella, who goes through a very public breakup and finds herself ostracized on the internet. It speaks to a greater issue converging on modern society, specifically in the domain of ethics, and whether human insecurities might be harnessed to the advantages of AI services like CTRL. Still, for the time being, it is a fictional service with no ties to reality.\n\nRead More: CTRL Ending, Explained: Why Does Nella Give Up?"

Jim Justice said in a release. An accompanying digital passport allows visitors to check in at haunted locations, earning points for prizes along the way.\n\nThe launch of the West Virginia Paranormal Trail follows the recent announcement of Haunted Ohio: 24 Must-Visit Places by TourismOhio, the tourism arm of the Ohio Department of Development. The Lafayette Hotel and the Hackett Hotel in Marietta are on the trail. Nearby on the list are Hocking Hills State Park in Logan and The Ridges at Ohio University at Athens.\n\n\u201cThe haunted and paranormal stuff is so popular,\u201d said Mark Lewis, president and CEO of the Greater Parkersburg Area Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\nLewis cited the popularity of the annual Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant, where the Silver Bridge collapsed in 1967, killing 46 people. According to folklore, the cryptid Mothman is tied to the collapse.\n\nThe Mothman Museum in Point Pleasant also is on the Paranormal Trail.\n\nIt\u2019s late in the tourist season, but not too late to promote the Paranormal Trail and the local attractions, Lewis said. A goal of the trail and its promotion, among others, is to increase room stays, he said.\n\n\u201cWe think we can bring in people for the haunted tours and the Paranormal Trail,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Blennerhassett Hotel is ranked in the Top 10 most-haunted hotels in North America, Adra Johnson, who runs the ghost tours and investigations at the hotel, said. She also is involved with the separate Susan Sheppard\u2019s Haunted Parkersburg ghost tour.\n\nAttractions applied to be on the Paranormal Trail, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very grateful to be on it,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nApparitions at the hotel include the specters of children playing tag in the halls, unexplained knocks on the door and hotel builder William Chancellor smoking a cigar, believers believe.\n\nThe Paranormal Trail has already generated interest, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten several phone calls already,\u201d she said.\n\nActivities are held year round at the hotel and are popular, Johnson said. Appalachian ParaCon, a paranormal convention, will be held Oct. 18, 2025, at the hotel, Johnson said.\n\nLewis will propose two more local attractions to be added to the trail, the Riverview Cemetery in the 1300 block of Juliana Street in Parkersburg and the Silver Tunnel on the North Bend Rail Trail, a 1,376-foot tunnel near Cairo.\n\n\u201cI think the Silver Tunnel is more well known for paranormal activity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe weeping woman statue overlooking the graves of the Jackson family is located at Riverview Cemetery where many notable citizens in Parkersburg\u2019s history are buried.\n\n\u201cRecent trends have shown us that travelers are increasingly interested in spooky and unique destinations,\u201d West Virginia Department of Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby said. \u201cWest Virginia has quite a few spots with haunted histories, so we created the Paranormal Trail to tap into the thriving market for themed tours and attractions. Whether learning about local legends or touring notoriously haunted attractions, it appeals to travelers interested in spooky sightings, mystery and local lore.\u201d\n\nOther landmarks on the Paranormal Trail are the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, Lake Shawnee Abandoned Amusement Park, Harpers Ferry, the Hotel Morgan in Morgantown, the Flatwoods Monster Museum in Flatwoods, Old Hospital on College Hill in Williamson, the Historic Glen Ferris Inn in Glen Ferris, the Shepherdstown Mystery Walk, the Haunted Haymond, the Elk River Trail between Ivydale and Duck and the West Virginia Penitentiary in Moundsville.\n\nInformation about the trail and how to earn points by visiting the site is at wvtourism.com/paranormal.\n\nTravelers can register online to participate in Paranormal Trail and receive the digital passport by email or text. Visitors check in to spooky spots around the state to earn points for an official Paranormal Trail sticker, a beanie and a limited-edition print by artist Liz Pavlovic of West Virginia.\n\nJess Mancini can be reached at jmancini@newsandsentinel.com."

        "article_content": "Ouija boards, spirited power figures and paranormal artefacts are not things you expect to see in a chapel, but this will soon be the case for one former place of worship that is going to be turned into a paranormal museum. Laura Rowton and her husband purchased the Penuel Chapel in Carmarthen from its previous owners Penuel Church last month, and plan to turn it into Rowton\u2019s Museum of the Paranormal and Spirituality.\n\nLaura said: \u201cWe are focusing on all different beliefs across time, including perhaps the less expected beliefs of the paranormal, popular spirituality, and looking at the history of that to provide an immersive experience to guests who are curious about the paranormal and different viewpoints about the nature of reality.\u201d\n\nThe couple chose the site specifically due to its history. Laura said: \u201cThis building actually has a paranormal history of its own. At the end of the 19th century, it is said to have been the site of miracles, particularly faith healing and supernatural manifestation. So it's a very special building in terms of the history of the paranormal and supernatural phenomena.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: I worked at Wales' most haunted house and it changed my view on life\n\nREAD MORE: The 12 most haunted places in Cardiff to visit this Halloween\n\nShe adds that the museum\u2019s aim is to \u201cgive people a chance to explore the different beliefs that people have had about the nature of reality in a safe space where there's no dogma.\u201d\n\nLaura says that the building is particularly suited for the museum and the couple has been busy decorating and moving their artefacts in. However they are particularly proud of their seance room in the old school room part of the building. She said: \u201cWe'll be holding seance evenings there, historical reenactments of a Victorian seance which was very popular in the 19th century and attended by many, many people within this country and around the world. This was a very popular spiritual practice. So we want to present that history to guests and give people a chance to immerse themselves in that.\u201d\n\nThe museum will have a range of exhibits in the chapel portions like exhibits on angels and saint relics. It will also have a \u2018laboratory\u2019 set up to look at parapsychological research.\n\nLaura said: \u201cWe're going to have some gadgets and tech in there, very exciting artefacts and also ones that guests will be able to interact with as well to see what these pioneers of the paranormal were doing in their research and also to have the chance themselves to see if they can have any experiences or responses that challenge their worldview.\u201d\n\nHowever not everyone is happy with the development, as the chapel\u2019s previous owners said they were unaware of the couple\u2019s plan to turn the chapel into a paranormal museum. In a statement shared on Facebook and their website, Penuel Church said: \u201cIn August 2024, we completed the sale of the building known as Penuel Chapel. We had been informed that the building would be used as a historical museum. However, in recent weeks, our church has sadly become aware of some other intentions of the current owners. We were unaware of these intentions at the point of sale.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cWe, as Penuel church, firmly believe in the truth of God\u2019s Word, the Bible. We therefore wish to state that the future intentions for the chapel site, as we understand them, are not in keeping with our church\u2019s ethos, values and beliefs. We would like to make clear that, as a church, we are in no way associated with this 'museum'.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Britain's 'most haunted village' where at least 12 terrifying ghosts are said to lurk\n\nREAD MORE:Welsh mansion to transform into haunted house this Halloween\n\nLaura insists that she and her husband had made their intentions to use the chapel clear at all different points of the sale. She said: \u201cFirstly, this is a historical museum and secondly, that statement is disingenuous by the previous owners. When my husband and I viewed the property back in December, we made our intentions clear that we would be turning it into a museum of spirituality. We told this to the estate agent and also it was brought up again on two separate occasions where we spoke over the phone and indeed in person with the previous owners. So we were always forthcoming about our intentions.\n\n\"Also, I'm a public person operating under the name Rowton's Museum. It's very easy to find out about the sort of work that my husband and I do. So I'm quite disappointed that they didn't come and talk to us first before making that statement. I think a lot of their concerns could have been alleviated. We're always happy to have a discussion with anybody. We've got nothing to hide and we think that we work for the same person anyway.\u201d\n\nIn reply to Wales Online\u2019s query, the Penuel Church said: \u201cThe intention with our statement was simply to explain that our church is not associated with the chapel and their future intentions, as they do not align with our church\u2019s ethos, values and beliefs as they do not align with our church\u2019s ethos, values and beliefs....\n\n\u201cThere is no more to say about this matter as far as we are concerned. We are glad to say that our focus is on looking to the future, and looking for a more suitable building for the current needs of our church, and continuing to do our best to reach out to our community with the great news about Jesus Christ.\u201d"

        "article_content": "AI, PoS, And ROI: An alphabet Soup Of 21st Century Drug Development\n\nBy Remco Jan Geukes Foppen, Vincenzo Gioia and Carlos N. Velez\n\nThis article is part one of a two-part series.\n\nPart 1: AI for rapid Drug Discovery\n\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of pharmaceutical development, AI promises to revolutionize the entire drug discovery and development process, impacting target discovery, clinical trial design, site selection, and even post-approval competitive monitoring and analysis. The latest AI models can dramatically accelerate the research pace supporting the pharmaceutical industry. Today, the industry faces increasingly complex challenges, such as chasing \u201cundruggable\u201d targets or developing bispecific antibodies. The industry is also seeking ways to lower the cost of drug discovery and development that, according to recent estimates, can easily exceed $1 billion.\n\nIn addition to increasing drug development speed and reducing costs, the adoption of AI models can potentially increase the probability of a drug completing Phase 2, the second major phase of clinical trials for a new drug, where the drug is tested on a larger group of patients to assess its efficacy and monitor side effects. Successful Phase 2 studies are a critical milestone in drug development. Therefore, anything which can help achieve this milestone could result in lower costs, faster times to approval, and improved likelihood of successful approvals and product launches.\n\nIn the first article of this two-part series, we identify and explain the AI technologies and tools that are transforming the drug discovery and development landscape, specifically focusing on use cases to accelerate drug discovery and clinical development. For the second article in the series, we will answer the following two questions: First, does the higher speed and lower cost with which AI can identify new molecules translate into an increase in the Probability of Success (PoS) in the crucial Phase 2 stage of clinical trials? And second, what is the financial benefit(s) of an AI-driven increase in PoS?\n\nThe AI Toolbox\n\nAI is a group of technologies that can be adopted individually or in combination to perform a specific task. These technologies resemble tools in a toolbox, enabling us to choose and use the right tool(s) at the right moment(s) for the right problem(s).\n\nFig. 1: AI tools representation\n\nAI enables machines to think and solve problems like humans. It encompasses machine learning, where machines learn from examples, and deep learning, which uses multi-layered networks for complex tasks like facial recognition. Generative AI, including large language models (LLMs), represents the latest evolution, allowing machines to create new content and process language in sophisticated ways.\n\nAI technologies, particularly generative AI, enable computers to create new content, such as text and images. As companies digitally transform, they unlock diverse data sources. These technologies power everyday tools from voice assistants to recommendation systems, making computers increasingly helpful. While the expanding AI toolbox offers new opportunities, it also presents challenges like the risk of AI hallucinations.\n\nHow GenAI Accelerates Drug Discovery\n\nGenerative AI, powered by deep learning, analyzes vast and diverse datasets across scientific literature, genomics, and experimental results, uncovering insights that might escape human researchers. It rapidly explores chemical spaces, generating and evaluating millions of potential molecular structures faster than traditional methods. This expands the range of drug candidates and allows AI models to predict molecular interactions with protein targets, identifying promising compounds and potential side effects early in the development process. Multi-objective optimization capabilities enable AI to simultaneously refine multiple desired properties of a drug, such as its efficacy, safety, and bioavailability, a complex and time-consuming task when approached through conventional means. Traditional drug discovery processes can be applied in silico only if LLMs are repurposed to drug discovery needs with domain-specific algorithms like structure prediction, homology, docking, protein design and possibly for in-house requirements to accommodate intellectual property.\n\nCurrently, AI is used most commonly in small molecule drug discovery, drug target discovery, and drug molecule design in oncology and CNS. While some may perceive the integration of AI in drug discovery as conflicting between overhyped and underestimated, many companies of all sizes, from startups to multinational companies are actively utilizing AI as point solutions or as fully AI-embedded end-to-end approaches. Leveraging years of confidential training data to discover and develop new drug candidates, these AI models continue to grow in size and complexity, and require increasingly advanced computational resources, including high-end GPUs that support GenAI, to process proprietary datasets securely. Interestingly, a small minority of companies have no current plans to implement AI/ML.\n\nThe integration of multiple data types, such as text, images, and sound, combined with LLMs enhances the granularity of analysis over single modality. There is a growing trend toward multimodal biomedical AI, and expectations are that efforts will be made for the first multimodal model to receive FDA approval. With these developments one will have to take into account the semantic divergence in the meaning and application of AI in order to achieve a common understanding, and to understand where hallucination risks occur so that the required validation processes for the outcomes are deployed. As regulators emphasize interpretability and explainability, feature importance of machine learning in disease prediction, in drug design and in clinical trial outcomes are becoming increasingly important to identify objective indicators. With new generative and multimodal AI, unanticipated and opportunistic outputs emerge, including the risk of hallucinations. Ultimately, the combination of GenAI and LLMs holds immense potential to revolutionize the drug discovery process, making it more efficient, precise, and innovative.\n\nAI-Focused Biotechs: Increasing Research Speed\n\nCurrently, a dozen AI-discovered drug candidates from various companies have entered in record time into Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, targeting a wide range of medical conditions. The first AI-designed drug to enter clinical trials with drug-like properties was DSP-1181, developed by a joint venture between Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma and Exscientia. The discovery phase for DSP-1181, aimed at treating obsessive-compulsive disorder, took only 12 months.\n\nInsilico Medicine showcased the capability to identify new drug targets and generate candidate molecules in just 18 months, further demonstrating the accelerated potential of AI in drug discovery. During the COVID-19 pandemic, BenevolentAI leveraged its AI platform to identify baricitinib as a potential treatment for the virus in just three days \u2014 an impressive example of rapid drug repurposing. Similarly, Verge Genomics advanced VRG50635, a small molecule inhibitor of PIKfyve for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), from research to clinic in just four years, successfully moving past Phase I trials. Many AI-enabled drug discovery programs now take less than four years to complete, compared to the typical five years or more required for the traditional discovery phase.\n\nIncreasing Speed With AI In Clinical Development\n\nAI is also revolutionizing clinical trials, from automating tasks to improving analytics and predictive modeling. The market for AI in clinical trials is rapidly expanding, with most reports projecting a CAGR of over 25%. However, estimates of current market size vary widely. Market.us reports a $174.1B market for 2023, largely driven by Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technologies, while Precedence Research estimates $1.6B. This discrepancy may partly stem from the increasing use of synthetic data in trials, such as developing synthetic control arms, which addresses patient privacy concerns and fills real-world data gaps.\n\nA recent FDA workshop highlighted AI's potential in trial optimization. Michael Lingzhi Li presented a case study with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, where interpretable AI predicted incidence rates at potential sites for their COVID-19 vaccine trial. This model adapted to changing conditions (such as COVID variants, mobility restrictions, release of vaccines, for example), resulting in 33% faster trials and 25% fewer participants. The interpretability of the model provided convincing arguments for the site selection, which as a consequence resulted in a diverse vaccine trial.\n\nAI tools are also enhancing trial operations, monitoring treatment response, improving patient engagement (reduction of patient drop out), and accelerating recruitment. In regulatory affairs, AI tracks global guidances \u2014 which as a reference are published around the world every 15 minutes \u2014 and predicts queries. These applications compound the speed improvements already seen in AI-assisted drug design.\n\nAI In Drug Discovery And Development: Faster\u2026Cheaper\u2026Better Value?\n\nAl-driven drug discovery is on the rise. Automating data analysis, and predicting outcomes with greater accuracy, result in drug candidates entering clinical trials in record time compared to traditional drug development. Beyond speed, AI promises to reduce costs by minimizing experimental overhead and even improving trial efficiency. This would not only cut financial burdens but also improve the quality of drug candidates balancing drug properties like safety and efficacy, and increasing the chances of approval and success in the market.\n\nIn the second installment of our series, we will examine real cost savings attributed to the use of AI, and whether AI can consistently improve the probability of success and likelihood of approval for new drug candidates.\n\nAbout The Authors:\n\nRemco Jan Geukes Foppen Ph.D., is an AI and life sciences expert.

        "article_content": "Managing email on a daily basis is the bane of many people\u2019s lives but efficiently managing your email inbox is more critical than ever. With an endless stream of messages flooding in, it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed and struggle to prioritize important communications. Fortunately, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and workflow automation have made it possible to create a powerful AI agent that can automate your email management without requiring any coding skills. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up an AI agent that can categorize and label incoming emails based on predefined criteria, ultimately enhancing your productivity and ensuring that you can focus on the most critical messages.\n\nGetting Started with Workflow Automation\n\nThe first step in creating your AI email management agent is to select a workflow automation tool that seamlessly integrates with your Gmail account. There are several popular options available, such as Zapier, IFTTT, or Automate.io, each offering a user-friendly interface and a wide range of integrations. Once you\u2019ve chosen your preferred tool, you\u2019ll need to set up an email trigger that will activate whenever a new email arrives in your inbox. To establish a secure connection between your Gmail account and the automation tool, you\u2019ll need to use your Google Cloud credentials. This crucial step ensures a smooth and secure flow of data, allowing your AI agent to process incoming emails effectively.\n\nChoose a workflow automation tool that integrates with Gmail\n\nthat integrates with Gmail Set up an email trigger to activate when new emails arrive\n\nto activate when new emails arrive Use Google Cloud credentials for secure integration\n\nConfiguring the Gmail API\n\nWith your workflow automation tool in place, the next step is to set up the Gmail API, which will allow your AI agent to access and manage your emails securely. This process involves creating an OAuth consent screen, which will enable users to grant permission for your AI agent to interact with their Gmail accounts. You\u2019ll need to generate an OAuth client ID and secret, which will be used to authenticate your AI agent and ensure secure communication between the agent and Gmail. This setup is essential for maintaining the privacy and security of your email data while allowing your AI agent to perform its email management tasks effectively.\n\nSet up the Gmail API for secure email access and management\n\nfor secure email access and management Create an OAuth consent screen for user authentication\n\nfor user authentication Generate an OAuth client ID and secret for secure communication\n\nNo Code Inbox Management AI\n\nHere are a selection of other articles from our extensive library of content you may find of interest on the subject of AI coding :\n\nClassifying Emails with AI\n\nWith the API configuration complete, you can now proceed to the heart of your AI agent: classifying incoming emails. In your workflow automation tool, you\u2019ll need to use a text classifier node that uses the innovative GPT-4 model. This advanced AI model excels at analyzing the content of your emails and accurately assigning them to predefined categories such as High Priority, Customer Support, Promotion, or Finance/Billing. By using the power of GPT-4, your AI agent can quickly and accurately sort through your inbox, saving you valuable time and allowing you to focus on the most important communications.\n\nUse a text classifier node in your workflow automation tool\n\nin your workflow automation tool Use the GPT-4 model for advanced email content analysis\n\nfor advanced email content analysis Sort emails into predefined categories like High Priority, Customer Support, Promotion, and Finance/Billing\n\nAssigning Labels for Organization\n\nOnce your AI agent has classified your incoming emails, the next step is to assign corresponding labels to each category. In your Gmail account, create a set of labels that match the categories you defined earlier, such as \u201cHigh Priority,\u201d \u201cCustomer Support,\u201d \u201cPromotion,\u201d and \u201cFinance/Billing.\u201d Then, in your workflow automation tool, configure nodes that will apply these labels to the emails based on their assigned categories. This labeling system will keep your inbox organized and allow you to quickly identify and respond to urgent messages, streamlining your email management process.\n\nCreate Gmail labels that match your predefined email categories\n\nthat match your predefined email categories Configure workflow nodes to apply labels based on email classification\n\nto apply labels based on email classification Keep your inbox organized for quick identification and response to urgent messages\n\nTesting and Launching Your AI Agent\n\nBefore deploying your AI email management agent, it\u2019s crucial to thoroughly test the workflow using a set of sample emails. This testing phase will help you ensure that the classification and labeling processes are working as expected and that your AI agent is accurately sorting and organizing your emails. Once you\u2019re satisfied with the results, you can activate the workflow, allowing your AI agent to operate continuously in real-time. With your agent up and running, you\u2019ll experience a significant improvement in your email management efficiency, as the AI takes care of sorting and prioritizing your messages.\n\nTest the workflow using sample emails to ensure accurate classification and labeling\n\nusing sample emails to ensure accurate classification and labeling Activate the workflow for continuous, real-time email management\n\nfor continuous, real-time email management Experience improved email management efficiency with your AI agent\n\nEnhancing Your AI Agent\u2019s Capabilities\n\nTo further optimize your email management process, consider enhancing your AI agent\u2019s capabilities by automating responses for specific email categories. For example, you can set up automated replies for common customer support inquiries, saving time and ensuring prompt communication with your clients. Additionally, you can configure your AI agent to notify relevant team members based on the classification of incoming emails, streamlining internal communication and collaboration. By implementing these enhancements, you\u2019ll create a more comprehensive and efficient email management system that adapts to your organization\u2019s specific needs.\n\nSet up automated replies for common customer support inquiries\n\nfor common customer support inquiries Configure notifications for relevant team members based on email classification\n\nfor relevant team members based on email classification Create a comprehensive and efficient email management system tailored to your organization\u2019s needs\n\nBy following the steps outlined in this guide, you can harness the power of AI to automate your email management tasks, even without any coding experience.

        "article_content": "A hot jobs report combined with still-dovish Fedspeak lifted the rate-sensitive software sector.\n\nSoftware leaders ServiceNow (NOW 3.04%), Snowflake (SNOW 3.85%), and UiPath (PATH 4.52%) rallied on Friday, up 3.1%, 3.7%, and 4.4%, respectively, in the day's trading.\n\nThere wasn't any company-specific news today on these three enterprise software leaders. However, today's solid jobs report, in combination with still-dovish commentary from Federal Reserve officials, sent each stock soaring.\n\nSoftware stocks to benefit from a soft landing\n\nThe past few years of rising interest rates have generally been difficult for software stocks. While ServiceNow has impressively managed to buck the trend and recover strongly after 2022's downturn, Snowflake and UiPath are still down 62% and 76% over the past three years, respectively.\n\nNOW data by YCharts\n\nInterest rates have had a lot to do with it. When the post-pandemic inflation took off and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, it hit software stocks in a number of ways.\n\nFirst, rapidly raising interest rates caused companies, fearing a downturn, to pull back on software spending, especially since there had been a huge amount of software adoption during the pandemic. Second, rising rates also disproportionally hurt software stock valuations, as software stocks tended to trade at very high multiples of earnings or sales. Rising rates lower the present value of earnings far out in the future, which hurt high-multiple stocks like software. So, software stocks were hit by a \"double whammy\" of slowing growth and sharply discounted valuations.\n\nWhat could reverse the trend? Well, a \"soft landing\" in which inflation and interest rates come down without a recession would be the ideal scenario. Increased confidence and hiring could spur more software \"seat\" subscriptions or, in the case of Snowflake's pay-as-you-go model, more consumption of computing. Meanwhile, lower interest rates would lift valuations.\n\nInflation has been coming down recently, which spurred the Federal Reserve to cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points last month on Sept. 18. Yet while some had thought lower inflation might go hand in hand with a slowing economy, today's September jobs report blew away expectations, with 254,000 jobs added, far above the 150,000 forecast and up from a revised 159,000 jobs added in August.\n\nSolid job growth and lower interest rates is the ideal environment for stocks generally, but especially the rate-sensitive software sector.\n\nOf course, the hot jobs report could mean that inflation may not be subdued yet, and could keep rates high. But Federal Reserve governor Austan Goolsbee, appearing on Bloomberg TV today, said the strong jobs report doesn't mean inflation is going up. He still sees inflation getting back to the Fed's 2% target and also declared no change in the outlook for continued interest rate cuts over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nThe next issue for software: AI disruption\n\nWhile the interest rate and economic picture looks terrific for software stocks now, there are still a few issues to consider. First, while interest rates are likely to get back to a \"neutral\" rate soon, they aren't likely going all the way back to pandemic-era low levels. So, one shouldn't expect software companies to reattain the inflated valuations they saw in 2020 and 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the AI revolution has the potential to benefit or disrupt certain software companies. ServiceNow has done quite well as it serves at the nexus of companies' private on-premises data and the outside cloud, and can therefore serve as a manager of enterprises' AI while also incorporating outside LLMs. Interestingly, UiPath and Snowflake are more cloud-based, and while they have been posting growth, they haven't been benefiting as much from AI -- at least not yet.\n\nSo while the interest rate picture is getting much better for software, investors will have to be choosy on which stocks will have AI as a value-add and which might see increased competition from the AI revolution."

        "article_content": "Google and Apple unveiled their latest smartphone lineups in the past few weeks. If you\u2019re interested in an entry-level phone option, you might want to consider the Google Pixel 9 and the Apple iPhone 16, which both include the latest and most powerful processors, fantastic cameras, and cutting-edge AI features. Both also include versions with various storage levels at different price points, and while they\u2019re among the cheapest in their respective ranges, you\u2019re unlikely to buy both. So which should you buy? Let\u2019s compare these phones and see how they stack up.\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: specs\n\nApple iPhone 16 Google Pixel 9 Dimensions and weight 5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches 6.0 ounces 6.02 x 2.83 x 0.33 inches 7.0 ounces Display 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display 1179 x 2556 resolution (460 PPI) 60Hz refresh rate Up to 2,000 nits peak brightness 6.3-inch Actua OLED 1080 x 2424 pixels (422 PPI) 120Hz refresh rate Up to 2,700 nits peak brightness Processor A18 chip Six-core CPU Five-core GPU 16-core Neural Engine Google Tensor G4 Titan M2 security coprocessor Rear cameras Dual camera system 48-megapixel Fusion main 12MP ultrawide Dual camera system 50MP wide 48MP ultrawide Front camera 12MP selfie 10.5 MP selfie Storage and memory 8GB/128GB 8GB/256GB 8GB/512GB 12GB/ 128GB 12GB/ 256GB AI Apple Intelligence (coming soon) Google Gemini Durability IP68 IP68 Software and support iOS 18 Six to eight years of software updates Android 14 Seven years of software updates Battery and charging 3,561mAh 45W wired fast charging 30W wireless (with MagSafe) 4.5W reverse wireless 4,700mAh 27W wired 15W wireless 4.5W reverse wireless Colors Ultramarine Teal Pink White Black Peony Wintergreen Porcelain Obsidian Price Starting at $799 Starts at $799 Review 4 out of 5 stars 4.5 out of 5 stars\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: design and display\n\nThe iPhone 16 and Pixel 9 have undergone design changes compared to their predecessors, the iPhone 15 and Pixel 8. These changes are not significant, but they are noticeable nonetheless.\n\nThe iPhone 16 features a new, smaller camera design on the back that generally changes its look compared to last year\u2019s models. Unlike previous generations, the camera system is now pill-shaped rather than having a square cutout. It should remind many of the iconic iPhone X. It\u2019s gorgeous. The Apple phone is available in classic white, black, vibrant pink, ultramarine, and teal. The chassis is made of aluminum, while the back is color-infused glass. At just 6 ounces, the iPhone 16 is one of the lightest smartphones to date.\n\nThe Pixel 9 and the rest of the Pixel 9 series feature a more polished design than the previous generation. Some say the phone lineup reminds them of Apple\u2019s in terms of its cleaner look. This is evident in the stylish dual camera system on the back, which has evolved from a visor into a prominent flat-top island mountain. It\u2019s simply gorgeous and something to appreciate. The phone\u2019s satin-finish metal chassis has just the right amount of curvature to seamlessly blend in with the flat Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 rear panel, making it a pleasure to hold. Like the iPhone 16, you can purchase a Pixel 9 in white (Porcelain) or black (Obsidian). It\u2019s also available in beautiful Peony and Wintergreen. Because Google\u2019s phone has a larger display than Apple\u2019s, it weighs an ounce more than its competitor.\n\nThe iPhone 16 features a 6.1-inch OLED display, while the Pixel 9 has a slightly larger 6.3-inch OLED display. Both displays offer excellent resolution, though the iPhone 16 leads slightly in this aspect, with a higher pixels-per-inch count that means it\u2019s a bit sharper and crisper.\n\nIn addition to screen size, the Pixel 9 outperforms the iPhone 16 in terms of its display\u2019s peak brightness and refresh rate. The Pixel 9 boasts an impressive peak brightness of 2,700 nits, surpassing the iPhone 16\u2019s still respectable 2,000 nits.\n\nFurthermore, the Pixel 9\u2019s refresh rate of 120Hz matches that of most high-end smartphones, while the iPhone 16 is limited to 60Hz. That\u2019s similar to previous iPhone models, but it\u2019s holding back the regular iPhone 16 series. As a result, the Pixel 9 delivers smoother screen refreshes, which is particularly noticeable during activities such as gaming.\n\nWinner: Google Pixel 9\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: performance and software\n\nBoth phones feature new chipsets: the iPhone 16 has an A18, while the Google Pixel 9 has a Google Tensor G4.\n\nThe iPhone 16 has significantly improved performance this year, thanks to the chipset and 8GB of RAM. Although Apple claims a 30% faster CPU and 40% faster GPU, you might notice little difference in everyday use since the iPhone 15 was already relatively fast.\n\nHowever, that A18 chip has other benefits that are (or will be) noticeable. Specifically, it enables the updated Photographic Styles on the phone and the upcoming Apple Intelligence package. The former has been around since the iPhone 13. This time around, however, the camera feature has been significantly improved. There are more styles to choose from, and you can now also customize the tone and color of each one using an improved slider control. Apple Intelligence, which the company has not yet released, will bring artificial intelligence to the iPhone for the first time. Once the feature is released, we will better understand how good the A18 chip is \u2014 or perhaps isn\u2019t.\n\nThe iPhone 16 ships with iOS 18, and based on previous iPhone releases, you\u2019ll likely get six to seven software updates.\n\nCircling back to the Pixel 9, previous Tensor G chips had been criticized for performance problems. In particular, some past Pixel users complained about overheating issues and occasional stutters, depending on what was done on the device. We had no issues with the Tensor G4 with 12GB of RAM featured in the Pixel 9. The performance on the Pixel 9 was the smoothest and most enjoyable Pixel experience to date.\n\nThe Pixel 9 comes with Android 14 software. Google promises seven years of software updates, which means you can keep your device for a long time if you choose. The Pixel 9 ships with Google\u2019s built-in AI assistant, Gemini. Better still, Pixel 9 users get a free year of Gemini Advanced, which adds more intelligence. That\u2019s a savings of around $240 for the year.\n\nLeaving aside the issue of AI, which we\u2019ll get to below, both of these phones have high-tier performance and long update promises. As such, this has to be a tie.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: cameras\n\nCameras have always been a significant part of smartphones, and that\u2019s still the case with the iPhone 16 and Pixel 9.\n\nThe iPhone 16 features a 48-megapixel Fusion primary rear camera, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a 12MP selfie camera. The camera setup is quite similar to that of the iPhone 15, although there are a few notable changes.\n\nOne significant change is that the ultrawide camera now offers autofocus, allowing macro photography. Additionally, you can capture Spatial photos that can be viewed on an Apple Vision Pro. The primary camera also now has a new anti-reflective lens coating, and it can capture pictures with zero shutter lag, similar to the iPhone Pro models.\n\nOverall, we\u2019re happy with the iPhone 16\u2019s cameras. The primary camera is excellent, capturing detailed photos with really pleasing colors. It also focuses quickly, handles moving subjects well, and does a great job in lowlight environments. The ultrawide camera makes taking macro photos a treat, and the selfie camera is as reliable as ever on the iPhone.\n\nThe most significant change to the iPhone 16\u2019s growing list of camera tools is the addition of a physical Camera Control button. This button on every iPhone 16 series phone functions like a traditional camera shutter button, but offers more functionality due to its built-in capacitive sensor. The sensor allows you to access six options on a new camera menu: exposure, depth, zoom, cameras, styles, and tone. To navigate these options, you can slide your finger across the Camera Control, lightly press the button to select an option, and then adjust the chosen setting by sliding your finger again.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, but Camera Control seems like a fun new way to interact with your iPhone\u2019s camera. However, it might take you a little bit of time to get used to it.\n\nThe Pixel 9 also features two cameras on the rear: a 50MP primary camera and a 48MP wide-angle camera that enables a macro mode. The 10.5MP selfie camera also has autofocus.\n\nWhen testing the Pixel 9, we took many photos, and we came away impressed. The primary and wide-angle cameras shot sharp, colorful images that were never dull or underwhelming. We also enjoyed using the phone\u2019s Action Pan, which adds motion blur to moving objects, and the new Reimagine feature in Magic Editor, which allows you to change scenes based on your imagination.\n\nCasual photographers will enjoy using the cameras on both of these phones, as they are equipped with hardware and software features that will provide years of enjoyment.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: battery and charging\n\nThe battery life of both these phones is decent, but not exceptional, especially when compared to more expensive phones from the same companies. Despite them both being decent, one is better than the other.\n\nThe iPhone 16 has a 3,561 mAh battery, which should last a day without recharging. On the other hand, the Pixel 9 has a bigger 4,700mAh battery, allowing you to use it for a second day (at least for a while) before recharging.\n\nThe iPhone 16 theoretically supports 45-watt wired charging, but seems to be limited to around 20W most of the time. We tested the iPhone 16 with an Anker 747 and found that it charged from 5% to over 60% in 30 minutes. However, it took over an hour and a half to reach 100%. Charging from a low or dead battery to around 70% is relatively fast, but the final 30% takes a while. If you prefer MagSafe charging, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that the iPhone 16\u2019s charge speeds have increased from 15W to 30W. Apple\u2019s phone supports MagSafe, Qi2, and Qi wireless charging.\n\nThe Pixel 9 maxes out at 27W charging, similar to the iPhone. It could charge a dead battery to 53% in 30 minutes and get an entire charge in 92 minutes. The Google phone supports Qi wireless charging, but not Qi2.\n\nWe\u2019re giving this one to Google\u2019s phone, if only because it has a bigger and longer-lasting battery.\n\nWinner: Google Pixel 9\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: AI\n\nIn just a few weeks, Apple plans to release at least the initial components of Apple Intelligence to the general public. Within six months, every feature should finally be available. Apple Intelligence is designed to provide a secure, helpful, and intuitive AI experience. It will offer personalized writing assistance, new creative tools, improved Siri, and more.\n\nGoogle Gemini, also available for iPhone through the Google App, is designed to help users make everyday tasks easier and offer a more helpful Google Search experience. Like Apple Intelligence, it will help you write better, improve your images, and more.\n\nBecause Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t available, the Pixel 9 wins this category by default.\n\nWinner: Google Pixel 9\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: price and availability\n\nThe iPhone 16 costs $799 for the 128GB model and $899 for the 256GB model. There\u2019s also a 512GB model for $1,099. The Google Pixel 9\u2019s base 128GB model also costs $799. The 256GB version is available for $859 if you need more storage.\n\nThe Pixel scores points because its 256GB model is available for $40 less than the similarly equipped iPhone 16 model. However, it loses that point because only Apple offers a 512GB model.\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: verdict\n\nThis result may change in six months. However, for now, the Pixel 9 bests the iPhone 16 overall. Google\u2019s entry-level phone has much more going for it, from having a larger display and battery to offering an AI product right now when you open the box.\n\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t a bad phone; it\u2019s actually a terrific phone that currently lacks some of Apple\u2019s promised features.\n\nUltimately, an incomplete product cannot outperform a completed one. However, your decision will likely be based more on each phone\u2019s operating system. If you prefer Android, you\u2019ll choose the Pixel 9 and Android 14; if you\u2019re a fan of iOS, then the iPhone 16 with iOS 18 is the one for you.\n\nGoogle Pixel 9\n\niPhone 16"
