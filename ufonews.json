        "article_content": "A long-awaited hearing that promised to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on UFOs has heard from witnesses about alleged secret crash retrieval programs, communication with non-human intelligence, and government intimidation of whistleblowers.\n\nThe US Congressional hearing on UAPs on Wednesday, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d featured testimony from Dr. Tim Gallaudet, a retired Rear Admiral in the US Navy, former Department of Defense official Luis Elizondo, former NASA administrator Michael Gold and independent journalist Michael Shellenberger.\n\nMuch of the testimony was rehashed from previous public claims, including those made by Elizondo in his August memoir about his role in a Pentagon UFO program \u2014 and there was little in the way of new evidence presented.\n\n6 The US Congressional hearing on UAPs on Wednesday, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d featured a testimony from Dr. Tim Gallaudet, a retired Rear Admiral in the US Navy. US Navy / SWNS\n\n\u201cThis hearing is intended to help Congress and the American people to learn the extent of the programs and activities our government has engaged in with respect to UAPs and what knowledge it has yielded,\u201d Republican co-chair Nancy Mace said in her opening statement.\n\n\u201cThis includes, of course, any knowledge of extraterrestrial life or technology of non-human origin. If government-funded research on UAPs has not yielded any useful knowledge, we also need to know those facts. Taxpayers deserve to know how much has been spent. They shouldn\u2019t be kept in the dark to spare the Pentagon a little bit of embarrassment.\u201d\n\nShellenberger, most significantly, provided the committee with a copy of an 11-page alleged whistleblower report describing various types of UAP evidence being illegally withheld from US Congress, including a supposedly unacknowledged special access program (USAP) collecting military-intelligence data on UAPs called \u201cImmaculate Constellation.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon last month categorically denied the existence of any such program after portions of the unnamed whistleblower\u2019s claims were first reported by Shellenberger on his Public Substack blog.\n\n6 A still from a previously released unclassified U.S. government video allegedly shows an unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAP). AARO / SWNS\n\nThe full document describes a number of alleged encounters or observations of UAPs, including a \u201clarge saucer-shaped UAP\u201d 200 to 400 meters across that was seen on satellite imagery emerging from thick clouds before suddenly reversing direction.\n\n\u201cThis behavior was evasive in nature and implied that the saucer-shaped UAP had become aware that it was under observation by a space-based collection platform,\u201d the document stated.\n\nIt also describes the shape and behaviors of the most common types of UAPs reported by government witnesses, including pilots between 1991 and 2022.\n\nSpheres or orbs were the most reported shape, followed by discs or saucers, then oval-shaped craft including \u201cTic-Tacs.\u201d\n\nTriangle, boomerang, and arrowhead shapes \u201cwere by far the rarest,\u201d while there were also rare reports of \u201cirregular or organic\u201d shapes such as \u201cfloating brain\u201d or \u201cjellyfish\u201d UAPs characterized by a \u201ccentral mass form from which multiple \u2018arms\u2019 or spars hang downward.\u201d\n\nThe US government allegedly holds infra-red footage of one such \u201cJellyfish\u201d UAP flying across the southern border with Mexico.\n\n\u201cIn appearance and behavior, footage of this UAP violating the airspace of the southern border resembled the same class of UAPs observed near DoD facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d the document said.\n\nIn his written testimony, Gallaudet said his \u201cconfirmation that UAPs are interacting with humanity\u201d came in January 2015 when he witnessed an email mysteriously disappear from his inbox on the Navy\u2019s secure network.\n\nGallaudet was serving as the Commander of the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command at the time and his personnel were taking part in a naval exercise off the US east coast.\n\nThe email, from a Fleet Forces Command operations officer to all subordinate commanders, bore the subject line \u201cURGENT SAFETY OF FLIGHT ISSUE\u201d and said words to the effect, \u201cIf any of you know what these are, tell me ASAP. We are having multiple near-midair collisions, and if we do not resolve it soon, we will have to shut down the exercise.\u201d\n\nAttached was the now-declassified video known as \u201cGo Fast,\u201d depicting a Navy F/A-18 encounter with an unknown object.\n\nGallaudet said the next day, the email disappeared from all recipients\u2019 inboxes without explanation, and superiors never discussed the incident again.\n\n\u201cThis lack of follow-up was concerning,\u201d he said.\n\n6 The long-awaited hearing that promised to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on UFOs has heard from witnesses about alleged secret crash retrieval programs and communication with non-human intelligence. AARO / SWNS\n\n\u201cAs the Navy\u2019s Chief Meteorologist at the time, my primary duty was to reduce safety-of-flight risks. Yet, it was evident that no one at the Flag Officer level was addressing the safety risks posed by UAPs. Instead, pilots were left to mitigate these threats on their own, without guidance or support. I concluded that the UAP information must have been classified within a special access program managed by an intelligence agency \u2014 a compartmented program that even senior officials, including myself, were not read into.\u201d\n\nGallaudet and the other witnesses decried the level of government secrecy around the topic, arguing it posed national security and economic risks.\n\nElizondo claimed a small group of people within the government had \u201ccreated a culture of suppression and intimidation\u201d and that \u201cexcessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel, and the public \u2014 all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\u201d\n\nGold called for an end to the \u201cstigmatization of the UAP phenomena.\u201d\n\n6 The Pentagon last month categorically denied the existence of any such program after portions of the unnamed whistleblower\u2019s claims were first reported by Shellenberger on his Public Substack blog. AARO / SWNS\n\nDemocratic committee member Jared Moskowitz agreed that \u201cunnecessary over-classification has led to a void of information which has allowed theories to foster over the decades.\u201d\n\nUnder questioning from Mace, Gallaudet described seeing satellite imagery from 2017 depicting a UAP, but could not provide many details as they were \u201cclassified.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a UAP, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cThe term that the analysts used, they called it the \u2018button\u2019. It was a disc-shaped object.\u201d\n\nKeep up with today's most important news Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Thanks for signing up!

Check out more newsletters\n\nAsked whether the US government had conducted secret UAP crash retrieval programs \u201cdesigned to identify and reverse-engineer alien craft,\u201d Elizondo answered a definitive \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nHe added he was aware of discussions within the Pentagon that alien bodies had been recovered \u201cbefore I was even born.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas there been to your knowledge any communication with a non-human life form?\u201d Republican Eric Burlison asked.\n\n6 The US government allegedly holds infra-red footage of one such \u201cJellyfish\u201d UAP flying across the southern border with Mexico. AARO / SWNS\n\n\u201cThe term communication is a bit of a trick word because there\u2019s verbal communication, the problem is you also have non-verbal communication, and so I would say definitely yes,\u201d Elizondo said.\n\n\u201cWhen a Russian reconnaissance aircraft comes into US air space we scramble two F-22s, we are certainly communicating intent and capability. I think the same goes with this. We have these things that are being observed over controlled US air space and \u2026 they\u2019re making it pretty obvious they have the ability to even interfere with our nuclear readiness.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing was a follow-up to July 2023\u2019s Congressional hearings which heard from witnesses including David Grusch, a former intelligence officer who claimed the US had retrieved crashed non-human craft and bodies.\n\n6 Wednesday\u2019s hearing was a follow-up to July 2023\u2019s Congressional hearings, reports said. AARO / SWNS\n\nFacing growing calls for transparency from Congress, the Pentagon established a new UFO investigation agency, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), in July 2022.\n\nAARO\u2019s first report, released in March, concluded there was \u201cno evidence that any [US government] investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cAARO assesses that the inaccurate claim that the [US government] is reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology and is hiding it from Congress is, in large part, the result of circular reporting from a group of individuals who believe this to be the case, despite the lack of any evidence,\u201d the report said."

        "article_content": "iPhone users in some markets discovered a standalone Google Gemini app for iPhone a few days ago. The app wasn\u2019t available in most markets, as Google was apparently testing it ahead of a more widespread release. Fast-forward to Thursday, Google is ready to make the standalone Gemini app available to iPhone users around the world. The Gemini went up in the App Store quietly, and you can download it right now.\n\nThe Google Gemini app is now available as a separate app from the main Google app, where you might have accessed the Gemini AI on the iPhone in the past. The best part about the Gemini app is that it comes with support for Gemini Live, Google\u2019s version of ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode.\n\nIt\u2019s a conversational AI that lets you talk to the chatbot just like you\u2019re speaking to a human. You can interrupt the AI and change prompts on the fly, similar to how a conversation between two people would flow.\n\nGemini Live isn\u2019t available in the main Google app on the iPhone, so Google\u2019s new standalone Gemini app is the only way to get it on your iPhone.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nGoogle Live will support personalization, as you can choose from various voices and languages.\n\nGoogle Gemini app for iPhone is available in the App Store. Image source: Google via App Store\n\nYou can use Gemini Live to talk about anything, just as you would with ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode. Here\u2019s what the Gemini app description says Gemini can do for you on the iPhone:\n\nGo Live with Gemini to brainstorm ideas, simplify complex topics, and rehearse for important moments. Just click on the Gemini Live button in your Gemini app \u2013 Connect with your favorite Google apps like Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and more \u2013 Study smarter and explore any topic with interactive visuals and real-world examples \u2013 Unlock a world of expertise and get tailored information about any topic \u2013 Plan trips better and faster \u2013 Create AI-generated images in seconds \u2013 Get summaries, deep dives, and source links, all in one place \u2013 Brainstorm new ideas, or improve existing ones\n\nFor example, Gemini Live can be a study companion, ready to assist you while you learn.\n\nThe Gemini app for iPhone also supports image generation, just like ChatGPT does.\n\nMore interesting to me is the Gemini\u2019s app integration with other Google apps and services you might be using on iPhone. The description says the Gemini app will connect with your favorite Google apps once you install it.\n\nGemini can connect to YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, Calendar, and other apps straight from your chat. That\u2019s certainly a useful feature if you use Google apps on your iPhone and want to include Gemini in that. This sort of interaction goes beyond what ChatGPT can do, and it\u2019s all the more interesting as Google doesn\u2019t have any say in how iOS works.\n\nGoogle Gemini app for iPhone: Features and screenshots. Image source: Google via App Store\n\nAlso, Gemini isn\u2019t part of Apple Intelligence like ChatGPT will be. Even then, ChatGPT will not be able to connect to any other apps. Siri will handle such capabilities later down the road.\n\nGoogle Gemini is available as a free download from the App Store. If you want access to Google\u2019s latest Gemini models, you\u2019ll need a Gemini Advanced subscription priced at $19.99. You can test Gemini Advanced for free for a month before you decide to keep it."

A key feature is Gemini Live, which wasn't available in the previous Google app implementation. When engaged in a conversation, Gemini Live appears in both the Dynamic Island and Lock Screen, letting you control your AI interactions without returning to the main app.\n\nThe app is free to download, and Google offers premium features through Gemini Advanced subscriptions available as in-app purchases. Gemini Advanced is part of a Google One AI premium plan costing $18.99 per month. Apart from Gemini in Mail, Docs, and more, it includes access to Google's next-generation model, 1.5 Pro, priority access to new features, and a one million token context window. Users need to sign in with a Google account to access the service.\n\n\n\nThe rollout follows an initial soft launch in the Philippines earlier this week, with availability now extending to additional regions including Australia, India, the US, and the UK.\n\nPreviously, iOS users could only access Gemini through a dedicated tab within the main Google app, which offered a more limited experience compared to the Android version. This standalone release, available on the App Store, brings feature parity closer between the two mobile platforms."

        "article_content": "Summary: Traditional paranormal beliefs, such as witchcraft and religious superstition, are linked to higher stress and reduced coping ability, while new age beliefs, like spiritualism and precognition, show no such link. Researchers used an improved scale to analyze responses from over 3,000 participants, revealing that traditional beliefs may reflect anxieties about external control.\n\nThe findings highlight the psychological differences between belief types but cannot confirm cause-and-effect relationships. Future research could explore how paranormal beliefs shape behaviors, such as attitudes toward alternative medicine and conspiracy theories.\n\nKey Facts:\n\nTraditional paranormal beliefs were associated with greater stress and reduced coping ability.\n\nNew age beliefs were not linked to stress or coping tendencies.\n\nThe study highlights the psychological impacts of external control perceptions in traditional beliefs.\n\nSource: PLOS\n\nIn a new study, feelings of distress and reduced ability to cope with stress were associated with traditional paranormal beliefs, but not with new age philosophy. Kenneth Drinkwater Ph.D. of Manchester Metropolitan University, U.K., and colleagues present these findings in the open-access journal PLOS ONE on November 13, 2024.\n\nPrior research has suggested that paranormal belief, in general, is not linked to poorer psychological wellbeing, but that certain facets of paranormal belief, such as superstition, may be linked with stress vulnerability.\n\nHowever, much of this research relies on a questionnaire known as the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, which has statistical issues that limit its usefulness.\n\nA different version, known as the Rasch purified Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, aims to improve on the earlier scale. To help deepen understanding of potential links between paranormal belief and stress, Drinkwater and colleagues had 3,084 people complete this scale alongside a questionnaire evaluating different facets of perceived stress.\n\nA key feature of the Rasch purified Revised Paranormal Belief Scale is that it differentiates between two dimensions of belief: first, traditional paranormal belief, which deals with cultural concepts of traditional religious belief and witchcraft, and second, new age philosophy, dealing with individual paranormal abilities known as psi, spiritualism, and precognition.\n\nAnalysis of the study participants\u2019 responses revealed that people who scored higher for traditional paranormal belief tended to show elevated distress and reduced feelings of being able to cope with stress.\n\nHowever, belief in new age philosophy was not statistically linked to any tendencies regarding distress or coping.\n\nThese findings are in line with the idea that traditional paranormal belief reflects anxiety about a lack of control over external forces that influence one\u2019s existence. However, the authors note that this study was exploratory and does not support any cause-effect relationship.\n\nMore research will be needed to clarify the relationship between paranormal belief and stress. The authors suggest that such research is important because paranormal belief can influence people\u2019s everyday behavior and attitudes, such as those regarding alternative medicine, antivaccination, and conspiracies.\n\nThe authors add: \u201cFindings support the notion that traditional paranormal belief is associated with external control, specifically the notion that unknown supernatural forces/powers influence existence.\n\n\u201cHowever, additional research is still needed if we are to further explore these fascinating relationships in connection to perceived stress, wellbeing and coping styles.\u201d\n\nAbout this neurotheology and stress research news\n\nAuthor: Hanna Abdallah\n\nSource: PLOS\n\nContact: Hanna Abdallah \u2013 PLOS\n\nImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n\n\u201cRe-evaluation of the relationship between paranormal belief and perceived stress using statistical modelling\u201d by Kenneth Drinkwater et al. PLOS ONE\n\nAbstract\n\nRe-evaluation of the relationship between paranormal belief and perceived stress using statistical modelling\n\nRecent research indicates that paranormal belief, in the absence of allied cognitive-perceptual and psychopathology-related factors, is not associated with negative wellbeing outcomes. However, investigators have historically reported relationships between specific facets of belief (e.g., superstition) and stress vulnerability.\n\nThese typically derive from the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS), which has questionable psychometric integrity. The main issue being that several RPBS items perform poorly.\n\nNoting this, the present paper re-examined the relationship between paranormal belief and stress using the Rasch purified version of the RPBS. This comprises two dimensions, called Traditional Paranormal Belief (TPB) and New Age Philosophy (NAP). These are operationalised in terms of function. Specifically, whether belief provides a sense of control at the social (TPB) or individual level (NAP).\n\nAccordingly, this study examined whether TPB and NAP were differentially predictive of levels of perceived stress. In this context, stress served as an indicator of well-being. A sample of 3084 participants (Mage = 50.31, SD = 15.20, range 18\u201391) completed the RPBS alongside the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10).\n\nConfirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling revealed that TPB was significantly predictive of higher Distress, and lower Coping. NAP was neither predictive of Distress nor Coping.\n\nThese findings support the notion that TPB is attendant with external control, particularly the notion that unknown supernatural forces/powers influence existence."

This extraordinary find, made during an October 2024 expedition by National Geographic's Pristine Seas team, reveals a massive coral structure visible even from space. Larger than a blue whale and estimated to be centuries old, this colossal colony has remained hidden until now, offering a rare glimpse into the resilience of marine life. As climate change threatens coral reefs worldwide, this discovery highlights both the beauty and fragility of these essential underwater ecosystems.This discovery not only sheds light on the size and resilience of the largest coral colony on Earth but also raises important questions about the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems and the need for conservation efforts to protect these vital organisms. The discovery of this immense coral colony emphasises the fragility and beauty of our planet\u2019s underwater worlds and the importance of safeguarding them for future generations.The massive coral colony measures 112 feet by 105 feet and sits at a depth of 42 feet underwater. It rises about 16 feet from the ocean floor and is estimated to be around 300 years old, though it could be much older. This discovery occurred just a day before the team was set to move to a new area for their research. A videographer who was documenting the impacts of climate change on the Pacific Ocean stumbled upon the coral while working, leading to the unexpected find.The coral is made up of nearly a billion tiny individual creatures that work together as a single organism. According to Molly Timmers, the expedition\u2019s lead scientist, the colony is a type of hard coral called Pavona clavus\u2014commonly known as shoulder blade coral. The coral's distinctive features include columns that resemble shoulders, and its colour palette includes various shades of brown, yellow, red, pink, and blue.One of the photographers on the expedition, Manu San Felix, described the coral as being like an \"underwater cathedral.\" He expressed a deep sense of awe and reverence for the coral, noting its long existence in one place, enduring for centuries despite the challenges of climate change and oceanic changes. The coral's longevity evokes a sense of connection to the distant past, as Timmers explained, saying that the discovery felt like seeing ancestors still present in the water.Corals, which are animals closely related to jellyfish and sea anemones, form colonies by clustering thousands of individual polyps. These colonies make up coral reefs, which are vital ecosystems for marine life. Sadly, corals are increasingly threatened by warming ocean temperatures and the effects of climate change. However, the coral colony in question seems to have avoided some of the worst impacts, likely because it resides in deeper waters, which provide some protection from the higher temperatures found closer to the surface.Interestingly, the researchers suggest that the local people in the area may have mistaken the large coral colony for a massive rock due to its size and appearance. This is an intriguing reminder of how even the most extraordinary natural phenomena can go unnoticed by those living in close proximity. It also highlights the often-hidden richness of the natural world and how much there is still to discover, even in well-explored areas.This discovery is not only significant in terms of its size and age but also in the broader context of coral conservation and the impact of climate change on ocean ecosystems. Seeing such a resilient and ancient organism in its natural habitat has a powerful emotional effect on those who encounter it. For Timmers, it is a reminder of the continuity of life over time, underscoring the importance of preserving these vital ecosystems for future generations."

The coral measured 112 feet wide, 105 feet long and 18 feet high with a circumference of more than 600 feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Just when you think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" Enric Sala, National Geographic Explorer in Residence and founder of Pristine Seas, said in a statement.\n\n\"This is a significant scientific discovery, like finding the world's tallest tree. But there is cause for alarm. Despite its remote location, this coral is not safe from global warming and other human threats.\"\n\nCoral is a living organism made up of a complex network of coral polyps, tiny individual creatures. Coral reefs, however, are made up of many colonies of corals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists said the newly discovered coral is so large that it can be seen from space and looks more like a huge rock lurking just under the ocean. The discovery comes as concerns continue over dying coral reefs around the world because of climate change.\n\n\"The ocean provides for our livelihoods and has contributed so much to our national economy and communities,\" Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele, told National Geographic. \"Our survival depends on healthy coral reefs, so this exciting discovery underlines the importance of protecting and sustaining them for future generations.\""

        "article_content": "Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have found that some of the universe's oldest galaxies are much brighter and heavier than scientists thought. The finding could lend credibility to an alternative theory to dark matter.\n\nThe standard model of galaxy formation predicts that only dim light should be seen from the primitive galaxies that took shape in the first billion years after the Big Bang . The unusually large and bright galaxies detected by JWST bolster predictions made by a rival theory known as modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). The researchers published their findings Nov. 12 in The Astrophysical Journal .\n\n\"What the theory of dark matter predicted is not what we see,\" study lead author Stacy McGaugh , an astrophysicist at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, said in a statement . \"The bottom line is, 'I told you so.' I was raised to think that saying that was rude, but that's the whole point of the scientific method: Make predictions and then check which come true.\"\n\nMOND proposes that for gravitational pulls 10 trillion times smaller than those felt on Earth's surface, such as the tugs felt between distant galaxies, Newton's laws break down and must be replaced by other equations. First proposed by Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom in 1982, the theory first emerged as an attempt to explain the faster-than-expected rotations seen around the outskirts of distant galaxies.\n\nRelated: Researchers spot rare 'triple-ring' galaxy that defies explanation\n\nMOND has had a number of successes, helping to unearth unexpected laws dictating how galaxies move through space. Yet the theory remains widely rejected by astronomers, who tend to favor cold dark matter theories, because it has yet to explain a wide range of cosmological phenomena. On the other hand, dark matter theories can explain a lot of observations, but they fail to do so for those accurately predicted by MOND.\n\nTo search for clues that could break the deadlock, the astronomers pored over data collected by JWST, capturing the dim signals of some of the earliest galaxies in the universe. According to their study, these ancient galaxies had grown significantly bigger and brighter than conventional dark matter models forecast, but they are exactly in line with the predictions made by MOND.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

It's possible that the additional brightness stems from supermassive black holes that are growing significantly faster than expected, but that idea presents problems of its own .\n\n\"We find ourselves caught between two very different theories that seem irreconcilable despite applying to closely related yet incommensurate lines of evidence,\" the astronomers wrote in the paper. \"The simple force law hypothesized by MOND has made enough successful a priori predictions that it cannot be an accident: it must be telling us something. What that is remains as mysterious as the composition of dark matter.\""

(NASDAQ:BIDU) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet.\n\nOne conversation gaining traction in Silicon Valley these days is how the advancement of Generative AI models is slowing down. Deirdre Bosa takes a look at the matter in CNBC\u2019s TechCheck, revealing how rapid genAI advancements are now showing signs of deceleration. She notes how the quality of improvement in OpenAI's upcoming model, Orion, is expected to be smaller than the leap from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4. This smaller advancement is largely due to a limited supply of training data, a key factor that could significantly affect how investors view AI companies.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\n\nNevertheless, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has boasted on X that ChatGPT is now the eighth-biggest website in the world by traffic. As of October, ChatGPT had 3.7 billion visits, versus Perplexity\u2019s 91 million visits, and Google Gemini's 292 million visits. Nevertheless, the plateau in technology advancement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a slowdown. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg proposes that there is a lot of opportunity to build consumer enterprise applications on top of the existing technology.\n\nWhile that is certainly an option, Reuters has reported that artificial intelligence companies are seeking a new path to smarter AI due to the plateau. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that scaling up pre-training for AI models, which involves using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn language patterns, has reached a plateau.\n\n\u201cThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever\u201d.\n\nIn light of this, researchers are now looking at a technique called \"time testing compute\" for improving models during the \u201cinference\u201d phase when such models are being used. The technique will allow the model to test different options instead of giving a single answer. The implications of the technique are far-fetched, having the potential to change the competitive landscape for AI hardware.\n\nRecent AI Developments\n\nFortune predicts that GenAI funding is going to decelerate this year. However, it also believes that the industry\u2019s recent breakthroughs are among the most profound technological advancements of our time. Regardless of the slowdown in GenAI models, artificial intelligence continues to be a breakthrough in many industries today.\n\nStory Continues"
