Free software for creating images and videos has led to a surge in slop, driven by scammers, spammers and the occasional genuine user seeking to go viral.\n\nFacebook\u2019s most recent report from its Transparency Center reveals that two of the top five most widely viewed images on the network in the three months to September were AI-generated \u2013 viewed 38.6m and 35.8m times respectively.\n\nMatt Navara, a social media consultant, says the novelty of these posts has quickly worn thin for many of Facebook\u2019s billions of users.\n\n\u201cThe proliferation of low-quality or spammy AI content risks cluttering feeds and diminishing overall user satisfaction,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing little evidence yet that users are actively demanding such content in their feeds.\u201d\n\nIn March, Facebook users began to notice a flood of images featuring Jesus Christ mixed with a crustacean rising from the sea. These \u201cShrimp Jesus\u201d posts garnered hundreds of thousands of interactions and tens of millions of views.\n\nOther weird AI trends soon emerged, including African women building fruit sculptures and young children showing off elaborate birthday cakes with the caption: \u201cThis is my first cake\u201d."

            "article_content": "The drone crisis that's been causing a stir across the eastern US shows no signs of abating. Hundreds of mysterious drones have been sighted in the skies recently, mainly over New Jersey but also reaching as far as New York and Connecticut.\n\nDespite officials' attempts to reassure the public that these unidentified objects pose no threat to national security, their unknown origins continue to fuel wild speculation. Some suggest they're on the hunt for \"nuclear warheads\", while others believe they could be the property of foreign superpowers.\n\nMore ominously, some observers reckon this wave of sightings is just the tip of the iceberg \u2013 with something major expected within the next few weeks. UFO expert Dr. Steven Greer has suggested that these strange lights seen worldwide are part of a staged operation designed to trick the public into believing an alien invasion is imminent.\n\nSpeaking to Newsmax's Rob Finnerty, Dr Greer predicted that the situation will escalate \"in the next 30 days or so\". He believes the supposed \"alien invasion\" is a cover-up to hide the real truth about extraterrestrial encounters, which he alleges have been happening for several decades.\n\nImage: (Image: Youtube/ABC 7)) (Image: Youtube/ABC 7))\n\nAccording to him, alien technology has fallen into the hands of US weapons manufacturers, who have initiated an operation to keep the conspiracy under wraps, reports the Express US.\n\nHe asserts: \"We have a team of about six different black sites that have been running illegal projects related to so-called UAPs and UFOs.\n\n\"Coming forward in the next 30 days or so, they will bring forth positive evidence of this and the fact that these programs have been run illegally and outside of constitutional oversight.\"\n\nIt's quite the bold statement, one that aligns with various commentators' forecasts that by early 2025, there'll be a significant shift in how the public is informed about UFOs. Ross Coulthart \u2013 who's become synonymous with the \"UFO disclosure\" campaign \u2013 has predicted that \"all hell is going to break loose\" as the new year ticks in, calling it \"the calm before the storm\".\n\nImage: (Image: Getty Images)) (Image: Getty Images))\n\nDespite the buzz, the enigmatic drones remain an unsolved riddle. U.\n\nS. Government honchos confess their ignorance regarding who controls these supposed drones, whilst simultaneously assuring there's no risk at play.\n\nCoupled with President-elect Donald Trump revealing that the US government has deep insights into the drone debacle, it seems clear that, regardless of what reality holds, incoming 2025 promises to be one heck of a rollercoaster for enthusiasts and skeptics alike."

            "article_content": "Tongyi Qianwen, Alibaba's large language model, on display during an expo in Shanghai last year. LONG WEI/FOR CHINA DAILY\n\nChinese startup DeepSeek has made a significant mark in the generative AI landscape with the groundbreaking release of its latest large-scale language model (LLM), which is comparable to leading models from heavyweights like OpenAI.\n\nDeepSeek's V3 model, trained for just two months using significantly fewer computing resources, delivers performance on par with the world's top proprietary model, GPT-4o, at a much lower cost than its rivals, according to the Hangzhou-based firm.\n\nDeepSeek-V3 makes it \"look easy today with an open weights release of a frontier-grade LLM trained on a joke of a budget (2,048 GPUs for 2 months, $6M)\", posted Andrej Karpathy, a founding member of OpenAI, on social media platform X.\n\n\"This is such clean engineering under resource constraints\u2026all of this looks so elegant,\" said Tim Dettmers, a research scientist at Allen AI, on X.\n\nDeepSeek's new open-source tool exemplifies a shift in China's AI ambitions, signaling that merely catching up to ChatGPT is no longer the goal. Instead, Chinese tech firms are now focused on delivering more affordable and versatile AI services.\n\nAccording to a 2024 report by the China Internet Network Information Center, 230 million users in China had registered for using generative AI-powered products as of June 2024.\n\nIn November, the Beijing-based AI startup Shengshu Technology unveiled its image-to-video tool called Vidu-1.5, capable of generating a video from as few as three input images within 30 seconds while establishing logical relationships among those objects in a scene.\n\nIts impressive performance has quickly garnered widespread admiration in both the AI community and the film industry.\n\nSony's Venom: The Last Dance, screened in China in October, was accompanied by an elegant Chinese ink-style promotional video crafted by Vidu. In the clip, ink blossoms across the screen as Venom morphs into a war horse, fish and crane, before playfully turning into a Kongming Lantern.\n\nUsing traditional film methods to produce a 30-second trailer typically takes about 30 days, but with Vidu, it only takes 10 working days and saves nearly 90 percent on post-production costs, said Zhang Xudong, product director of Shengshu Technology.\n\nAI design can also inspire artists, offering new creative ideas beyond expectations, Zhang added.\n\nIn March, Wang Feng and his team at East China Normal University unveiled a million-word AI-generated fantasy novel, Heavenly Mandate Apostle, crafted with a homegrown large language model. \"This novel was completed in just a month and a half, a feat that would take a dedicated human author a full year to match,\" Wang said.\n\nThe team later launched their second AI-generated novel, The Awakening at the Machine Epoch, which features a more gripping narrative, averaging 1.5 conflicts per chapter compared to the 1.2 in their first work.\n\nThe Xingye chatbot, developed by Shanghai-based startup MiniMax, uses AI to enable users to interact with a virtual romantic partner. However, its youthful user base has fostered a unique \"community vibe,\" as the app combines an AI chatbot with a collectible card system, creating a dynamic platform for user-generated content.\n\nThe chatbot is drawing in a variety of internet culture enthusiasts, ranging from anime and comic fans to cosplayers and gamers, who use AI virtual characters to collaboratively create unique narratives deeply resonant with their respective communities.\n\nXingye's international version, Talkie, along with another Chinese AI companion app, Poly.ai, ranked among the top 10 most downloaded AI apps in the United States during the first half of 2024.\n\nAlibaba's Tongyi LLM, specializing in digital avatar tech, has recently gained internet fame with its \"All-People's Stage\" feature. This innovative feature transforms static photos into dynamic singing or dancing videos, setting a new trend in entertainment.\n\nIn June, during a gala on China Central Television, Tongyi's AI-generated technology enabled Terracotta Warriors to perform the traditional Chinese art form of Huayin old tune.\n\nHowever, the misuse of talking head technology has led to a surge in fake content, such as rewriting the classic Dream of the Red Chamber as a martial arts story.\n\nLast month, China's broadcasting watchdog issued new rules to strengthen oversight, highlighting the country's commitment to closely monitoring the rapid growth of AI.\n\nXinhua"

I have tried YouTube Music and Apple Music, but frankly, neither of them really meets my needs as well as Spotify does. The app this year also has one of my favourite end-of-year features \"Spotify Unwrapped\" and this year it integrated a lot of AI to give me more information on my listening habits!\n\n\n\nI will say that while Netflix is the king of streaming services there are many others out there with great shows. But of course, there can only be one winner and we picked Netflix! There are a lot of great shows and it's highly entertaining, not to mention that the streaming giant is also getting into the world of live TV, which we suspect will expand over the next year.\n\n\n\nFinally, we couldn't finish this list without talking about the best Android app: Gemini. Google outdid itself with a truly remarkable app and it's one the AC Staff has been very excited about using.\n\n\n\nCongrats to all the winners!\n\n\n\nOf course, here's what some of my colleagues, Derrek Lee, Patrick Farmer, and Namerah Saud-Fatmi have to say about the winners,\n\nBest music streaming service: Spotify\n\nAndrew's Spotify Wrapped 2024 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\n\nDerrek Lee: We just can\u2019t quit you, can we? Spotify continues to be not only our favorite music streaming service but, apparently, everyone else\u2019s too. Just in November, the company reported that it has 252 million subscribers, up 12% from the previous year. It also has more than 640 million monthly active users, which is up 11% from last year. So why do we love Spotify so much?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe streamlined UI just makes it impressively easy to listen to the music you love and discover new tracks. And while Spotify has yet to introduce its long-awaited Hi-Fi tier, the company continues to add and test new features to stay ahead of the game, such as personalized AI-generated playlists that let you tell it what you want to listen to. It also added a cheaper base plan for users who don\u2019t need access to audiobooks.\n\nIt was a pretty good year for Spotify, but we hope 2025 will be a great year for audiophiles who await higher-quality listening. With any luck, we\u2019ll finally get that \u201cSuper Premium\u201d plan we\u2019ve been hearing about.\n\nRunner-up: YouTube Music\n\nMeanwhile, YouTube Music is our runner-up as Google continues to make its streaming app more competitive. This year, the company has made a few tweaks to the UI and added a number of AI features to help you create playlists and thumbnails. It hasn\u2019t been too exciting of a year for YouTube Music, but it\u2019s steadily becoming a worthy Spotify competitor for anyone looking. Earlier this year, Google celebrated 100 million subscribers, so something must be working.\n\nBest video streaming service: Netflix\n\nNetflix splash screen on a tablet\n\nPatrick Farmer: Despite a controversial password-sharing crackdown and another round of predicted price increases on the horizon (according to analysts), 2024 was a great year for Netflix. From blockbuster films to original series and holiday romcoms \u2014 did anyone else watch \u201cThe Merry Gentlemen\u201d? Just me? All right, moving on \u2014 Netflix has content for just about every type of user.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year may not have seen Netflix dropping any groundbreaking cultural phenomena like \u201cSquid Game\u201d or \u201cStranger Things,\u201d but it has continued to hold the line as the world\u2019s most popular streaming service. And with its recent foray into the world of gaming, it\u2019s clear that Netflix has no intention of resting on its laurels any time soon.\n\nBest Android app: Gemini\n\nGemini response on Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNamerah Saud-Fatmi: Apps are available a dime a dozen, but it takes an infinite amount of effort and beyond to make the best one. Google had all the right resources for the job and put them to work with Gemini. This language model married the smarts of Google Assistant to concoct the ultimate Android app.\n\nWith Gemini, anything is possible. Need to create automations for your smart home? No problem. Have some code that needs help getting written? Done deal. There's very little this AI can't handle, be it image generation or pulling from all your Google services like Gmail to answer prompts."

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nSiri has been Apple's virtual assistant for many years; it's designed to respond to your questions and requests. But Siri can fall down on the job, sometimes failing to properly understand or handle your task. And on its own, Siri is not a generative AI tool, so it can\u2019t tackle the types of requests more advanced AI bots can handle.\n\nSiri\u2019s limitations are why Apple has added OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT AI to its devices. Available on supported iPhones, iPads, and Macs, ChatGPT integrates directly via Apple Intelligence, popping up to respond to you when Siri is in over its head.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDepending on your device, you\u2019re able to use ChatGPT a few different ways.\n\nYou can ask Siri to call on ChatGPT to help with certain types of requests, especially those better suited to generative AI. Use ChatGPT with the AI-powered Writing Tools feature to write and edit text based on your descriptions. On an iPhone, you can use ChatGPT with Visual Intelligence, which taps into the camera to provide info on the places and objects around you.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a ChatGPT account to use the AI through Apple Intelligence on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. But if you do have an account, you can simply connect to it through your device. Using an existing account means that you\u2019ll be able to access a history of your requests. Plus, those of you with a paid ChatGPT Plus plan can directly take advantage of the advanced premium features. However, using ChatGPT without an account means that your request will be anonymous and won\u2019t be used for AI training.\n\nYou can still use the ChatGPT app and website on your Apple device, but the integration with Apple Intelligence is quicker and easier. The main limitation here is that you need a device that supports Apple Intelligence. That means any iPhone 16, an iPhone 15 Pro, an iPhone 15 Pro Max, any iPad model with an M1 chip or later, a 2024 iPad mini with an A17 Pro chip, or a Mac with an M1 chip or later. Now, how can you use ChatGPT on your Apple device? Let\u2019s check it out.\n\nUpdate Your Device\n\nFirst, you have to update to iOS 18.2 on your iPhone, iPadOS 18.2 on your iPad, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 on your Mac. On your iPhone or iPad, head to Settings > General > Software Update. On a Mac, go to System Settings > General > Software Update. Select the Update Now button to download the latest version.\n\nActivate Apple Intelligence\n\nNext, you need to enable Apple Intelligence. Go to Settings on your iPhone or iPad and System Settings on your Mac. Select the setting for Apple Intelligence & Siri and turn on the switch for Apple Intelligence if it's not already on.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnable ChatGPT\n\nNow, you want to enable ChatGPT. Swipe or scroll down the Apple Intelligence & Siri screen and select ChatGPT in the Extensions section. Turn on the option for Setup Prompts if it\u2019s turned off. This lets Siri suggest using ChatGPT if you submit a question or request that Siri can\u2019t answer. Then tap or click Set Up next to the option for Use ChatGPT.\n\nSet Up ChatGPT Without an Account\n\nThe next screen describes the various ways you can use ChatGPT. Click or tap Next. The Privacy and ChatGPT screen explains how the AI integration aims to keep your privacy in mind.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a ChatGPT account or want to use the tool anonymously on your device, click or tap the button for Enable ChatGPT. The next screen confirms that ChatGPT is enabled, that your use of the AI is subject to a daily limit, and that Siri will require confirmation anytime you want to turn to ChatGPT. You may also see an option to open the ChatGPT app or download it if you\u2019ve used it before.\n\nSet Up ChatGPT With an Account\n\nTo use an existing ChatGPT account with Apple Intelligence, choose the option for Use ChatGPT with an Account at the Privacy and ChatGPT screen. Next, select the button for Sign In and Enable ChatGPT. Select the Log In option and enter the username and password for your ChatGPT account. The next screen shows that you\u2019re signed in with your account.\n\nHave Siri Use ChatGPT\n\nNow you\u2019re ready to dive into ChatGPT. You can start by sending Siri a question or request that you don\u2019t think it would be able to handle, like generating specific text for an email, message, or other app. For example, you could say: \u201cSiri, compose a note asking my boss for a 10% raise based on all the projects I completed this past year.\u201d Siri should tell you that it will need to use ChatGPT to write that and ask for your permission. Say Yes, and ChatGPT takes over to compose the content you need.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsk Siri to Use ChatGPT\n\nIn some cases, Siri may or may not turn to ChatGPT to take on your request. If you purposely want to use ChatGPT, then tell Siri to use ChatGPT followed by your request. For example, you could say: \u201cSiri, use ChatGPT to name and describe the six wives of Henry VIII.\u201d\n\nCarry on a Conversation With ChatGPT\n\nYou can also carry on a conversation with ChatGPT. Again, ask Siri to use ChatGPT to respond to a request. You\u2019re then able to ask follow-up questions based on ChatGPT\u2019s responses.\n\nUse ChatGPT With Writing Tools\n\nAnother feature that comes with Apple Intelligence is Writing Tools, through which you can ask for help composing or revising an email, message, or other text. To try this, open an app such as Mail or Messages. Press down on the area where you\u2019d enter text. From the menu, select Writing Tools, select Compose, and then tap the option for Compose with ChatGPT.\n\nType or dictate a description of the subject of the email or message. ChatGPT then writes it for you. You can review, refine, and rewrite the draft and add further details. When finished, tap Done.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUse ChatGPT With Visual Intelligence\n\nVisual Intelligence is an AI-powered feature that can serve up information on objects seen through your iPhone\u2019s camera. To try this, you\u2019ll need an iPhone 16 with the new physical Camera Control button. Aim your camera at an object that you\u2019d like described. Press down on the Camera Control, and the Visual Intelligence screen appears. Tap Continue and then tap Ask. ChatGPT automatically pops up and provides details about the object your captured.\n\nManage Your ChatGPT Settings\n\nFinally, you\u2019re able to easily manage the settings for ChatGPT. On your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings. On your Mac, go to System Settings. From there, navigate to Apple Intelligence & Siri > ChatGPT. Here, you can turn off ChatGPT, sign in or out of your ChatGPT account, and disable the option for Confirm ChatGPT Requests if you don\u2019t want Siri to ask for your permission each time it wants to pass the ball to ChatGPT."

            "article_content": "(MENAFN- Live Mint) : Recording footage from the window when your flight is zooming past the clouds is very common. So is trying to associate cloud shapes with familiar objects from our lives. But a recent viral video of clouds shows something unfamiliar, and has left social confused on what it actually is.\n\n\u201cA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?\u201d stated a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, Myra Moor, while posting the video on her X account. She also added several hashtags such as #paranormal, #aliens to her video post.\n\n| Viral video: Drunk man climbs electric pole, takes nap on wires mid-air\n\nThe video was purportedly filmed by a plane passenger on a commercial airline. A close look at the video shows what looks like two human beings standing on cloud cover. The camera then pans to show several other such figures in the sky.\n\n'Are those angels...'\n\nThe viral video has garnered nearly 5 million views on X. While many claimed those could either be angels, or sky scrapers poking into the sky, several others gave logical explanations stating that it could be smoke stacks.\n\n\u201cThat's wild. Are those angels? Something big is coming. 2025 is going to be a crazy year. Buckle up,\u201d commented one user.\n\n| Viral Video: 90-year-old tries pizza for the first time\n\nSome other users refused to believe the video was real.\n\n\u201cI don't believe it. If a normal human was recording this we would be zoomed in staring straight at the things until the plane was out of sight,\u201d added another user.\n\n'Steam rising from exhaust stacks...'\n\n\u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks,\u201d an X user explained.\n\n| Squid Game 2 comes to Mumbai: Indian influencers fight for survival\n\nAnother person shared a similar response:\u201cI got an answer from a highly experienced pilot, 'Probably smoke stacks or cooling towers below the cloud layer. Looks like a very low fog layer. And this isn't the tower itself but the actual steam coming out of them rising above the fog.'\u201d\n\n(Mint could not independently verify the authenticity of the video)"

Yes, it is going to be a year of sequels, remakes and series continuations.\n\nEconomically, this makes sense, as studios recover from covid-19, the writers\u2019 strike and bloated budgets.

Netizens have likened the event to other whistleblowers and individuals who allegedly committed suicide despite not being suicidal.\n\nBackground\n\nSuchir Balaji was a 26-year-old artificial intelligence researcher who worked at OpenAI for about four years before leaving in August 2024. He gained attention as a whistleblower after he publicly alleged that OpenAI violated US copyright laws in the development of its AI models like ChatGPT. In an October interview with The New York Times, Balaji said he believed the company's practices could harm individuals and businesses by using their copyrighted content without permission. His criticisms coincided with OpenAI facing lawsuits from news organizations and authors accusing it of unlawful data use for training its AI systems.\n\nBalaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26, 2024. The San Francisco medical examiner's office ruled his death as a suicide.\n\nDevelopments\n\nBalaji's family disputes the suicide ruling, alleging signs of foul play and calling for an FBI investigation, citing inconsistencies in the circumstances surrounding his death.\n\nElon Musk replied \"This doesn\u2019t seem like a suicide\" on his social media platform X to a post by Balaji's mother that claims her son was murdered. Musk's reply received around 945,000 views, 10,000 likes and 1300 reposts.\n\nOnline Reactions\n\nRedditors have opened numerous threads related to the whistleblower in subreddits such as r/Futurology, r/news, r/technology and r/singularity that have garnered at least over 1000 comments. The whistleblower's death being ruled as a suicide has been associated with several other whistleblowers' deaths which have also been ruled as suicides, such as the Boeing whistleblowers, and the suicide of John McAfee, who tweeted in the past that he will never commit suicide.\n\nMedia Coverage\n\nLarge news organizations such as CNBC, BBC, and The Economic Times have covered developments related to Balaji's death.\n\nSearch Interest\n\nExternal References"

            "article_content": "It looks like Elon Musk is not alone in a legal battle thrown to thwart OpenAI from switching to a for-profit company.Geoffrey Hinton who earned recognition as being the top mind in the AI industry, not to mention a prominent data expert, is actually showing support for Musk and his legal case that wants to bar OpenAI from making the switch.Hinton shared more on this front including how OpenAI was founded with a sole purpose and that was to be non-profit. To make a sudden switch is questionable and unacceptable in his eyes. Remember, the company was first known as a safe non-profit entity so it\u2019s alarming why it thinks making the switch would be acceptable now.Hinton who is also a Noble Peace Prize winner of 2024 for his groundbreaking work in the world of physics shared several safety-based promises inside the charter. This includes marketing AI to better human abilities instead of seeking a replacement. It also has so many tax and different benefits, thanks to its non-profit status.The fact that it could tear that up into shreds and move on as if nothing happened in the past is not only irresponsible but also setting the wrong standards for today\u2019s industry, he continued. Remember, OpenAI was first founded in 2015 as a research lab working on a non-profit basis by leading members Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and several others.In 2019, it started to behave similar to the workings of a startup firm. Then it came up with capped-profit models featuring non-profits staying in control of the entire firm. For now, it\u2019s on a mission to get a more classic for-profit stance that enables the firm to raise the capital it needs using conventional terms that\u2019s similar to others working in this space. This was mentioned by the company itself in a blog published last week.But Musk is keen to block this switch and has been rivaling many of its actions since he left the board in 2018. Encode already rolled out a legal document that provided more information of a court case from a group that may not be involved directly but full supports the lawsuit blocking OpenAI.Such restructuring would undermine the company\u2019s committment to make public safety a priority, Encode shared in its recent statement. It further added that the company is currently operating in a non-profit where essential guardrails are in place and if the switch happens, these get forfeited.This is not the first time that we\u2019re seeing Hinton go against OpenAI with public criticism. A press conference from October shed light on how opposed Hinton was with Sam Altman. He felt the CEO was more worried about making money and less concerned about public safety. If that was not enough, he called this entire scenario a very unfortunate situation.In the past year, Hinton shared more on this front including how he needed to sound the alarms before AI could cause a major catastrophe for humanity. He also shared with the NYT how much he regretted his position in developing AI tech.On the other hand, Musk\u2019s concerns are a little more on the personal side. They have to do with him feeling like he was betrayed by top executives in terms of co-founding the firm and acting like they were just as worried as him about the concerns related to AI. However, OpenAI refutes those claims. It says that the tech billionaire had another vision which included transforming the organization into one that makes profits from the start and that was as early as 2017.Image: DIW-AigenRead next: Fake Stars Are Being Used To Boost Malicious GitHub Repositories, New Study Claims"

Kevin Zhou\u2019s Sam Altman, published in November 2024, is a detailed portrait of the AI entrepreneur, from his early days as a Stanford University dropout to the launch of his first start-up, Loopt, through his late 20s as the head of start-up accelerator Y Combinator. It also covers recent developments including the power struggle at OpenAI.\n\nZhou, founder of tech media Pandaily, personally knew Altman a decade ago at Stanford and interviewed him in November 2023, days before he was temporarily ousted as OpenAI\u2019s CEO.\n\nAfter reading the book, Altman said he was impressed by its detail and would \u201clove to participate\u201d in a follow up when he retires, according to the book\u2019s official introduction on Douban, a popular website for reviewing books and films.\n\nThis photo illustration shows the ChatGPT logo at an office in Washington, DC, on March 15, 2023. Photo: AFP\n\nAlthough most of the research was done from public records and media reports, the book does offer some exclusive content, such as Altman\u2019s opinion on China and the country\u2019s tech companies. He said he should have visited China more when he was teaching an entrepreneurship course as Y Combinator president. In 2018, Y Combinator, still under Altman\u2019s leadership, formed its China unit."

            "article_content": "There is very little movement in markets over the Christmas period, so this week we are looking at selling and what might affect markets in the new year.\n\nThis time of the year is quieter on tillage farms.\n\nYes, there is still work to be done, but there is time to catch up on crop records, costs and returns.\n\nKnowing the costs and returns of all your crops is essential.\n\nIn order to decide on what price to sell your grain at, you need to know your costs, so get this job done as soon as possible and decide on a price that you are happy to sell at to spread risk.\n\nThis was brought up numerous times at Tillage Day 2024 and it was clear it is a job that more farmers need to do.\n\nHaving those figures to hand and deciding on a number to sell at makes the decision easier to make once you get a text message with prices from your co-op or merchant.\n\nForward selling\n\nIn recent years, harvest prices have worked out very well for people, but that doesn\u2019t say it will happen every year.\n\nThat said, you are probably better off to either take the harvest price every year or do some forward selling every year, rather than dipping in and out of both of them, or else you may lose out badly in certain years.\n\nIf you are forward selling grain, then you should only be selling about 50% on your estimated production. You should be a little bit pessimistic with yield predictions as well.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be in a situation where you have sold grain, but don\u2019t have that grain. At Tillage Day, Donal Moloney of Tirl\u00e1n explained that farmers can sell as little as 20t at a time when forward selling grain.\n\nIf you think about that, you could be selling small amounts of grain every week or every two weeks or even once a month to get an average price from the season.\n\nThis would be spreading risk - something similar to the Boortmalt pricing system where an average price is taken every week from the middle of April to the middle of September.\n\n2025 prices\n\nLooking ahead to prices and it is very hard to know where they will end up this season. There was a lift in prices in December.\n\nTeagasc economist Fiona Thorne estimated that prices could rise by 5% in 2025 at their recent Outlook Conference.\n\nThis prediction was based on the difference between historic predicted values of French wheat prices and the actual outcomes.\n\nTeagasc estimated an increase in EU cereal production and an increase in Irish cereal yields. Looking at costs and Teagasc placed fertiliser prices down 5%, but fertiliser use up on a whole-farm basis."

Some 10 to 20 women also worked at the observatory, but they were the \u201ccomputers\u201d\u2014a term used for lab assistants who performed calculations. In this case, the women looked for patterns in the starlight and recorded changes to the visible stars. Payne, under a graduate fellowship, had a different role from the other women.\n\nHer mentor Harlow Shapley initially urged Payne to continue the work of a computer, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, who had realized that variations in some stars\u2019 light could be used to measure distances. But Payne wasn\u2019t interested in Leavitt\u2019s project. \u201cInstead, she wanted to focus on the decades of mostly untouched spectroscopy plates,\u201d says Burns.\n\nNo institution had more of those emulsion plates preserving star signatures than Harvard. Another computer, Annie Jump Cannon, had started to classify stars based on their signatures. Payne wanted to build on this work, combining what she learned about the inner workings of atoms at Newnham with the recent scientific theories of physics and chemistry, to understand stars.\n\nThe physics of the stars\n\nPhysics research was accelerating at the time, and the discoveries and scientific theories were traveling across the globe.\n\nResearchers had figured out the source of the patterns on spectroscopy plates\u2014electrons shifting energy levels as they zipped around an atom\u2019s nucleus, an action that emits or absorbs light. The color of that light was specific to a particular atom, meaning an electron in a carbon atom would always absorb or emit the same amount of light to reach a zippier state or drop back to a relaxed state. Within a few years, experiments determined most of energies that kick electrons to different levels for many of the atomic elements."

            "article_content": "Every year brings the accounting industry new tools, tech buzzwords and promises of transformation. How do firms separate the noise from what truly delivers value?\n\nSilverfin\n\nTechnology certainly has the potential to change the way accountants work for the better, but it can be difficult to know which trends are worth the investment of time, effort and budget, and which will fade away.\n\nIn this wrap-up of 2024 and look ahead to 2025, we explore what\u2019s exciting accountants, what concerns them, and how they\u2019re using capabilities like AI to drive their next chapter of growth. Most importantly, we\u2019ll also touch on what your firm should consider to stay competitive in the year ahead.\n\nOver 75% of firms have invested more in technology this year\n\nAccording to the UK Accountancy Sector Outlook Report by HSBC UK and Accountancy Age, over 75% of firms have increased their technology spending year-on-year, reflecting the industry\u2019s growing willingness to invest in digital tools.\n\nHowever, 15% of firms acknowledge difficulties in adapting to technological advancements, suggesting that while most are keen to innovate, some still face challenges in keeping up.\n\nFirms are actively exploring AI, with over 30% already integrating it into their operations and a further 23% planning to adopt it in 2025. This growing interest in AI reflects its potential to improve processes and support growth.\n\nTechnology adoption is not a one-size-fits-all journey\n\nThe report highlights an important point: technology adoption looks different for every firm. While the entire industry recognises the importance of digital transformation, it seems as if priorities and strategies differ significantly based on firm size and resources.\n\nLarge firms are scaling and optimising\n\nBigger firms are leading the charge in technology adoption, with 37.5% significantly increasing their tech investments. Their focus has shifted from adopting new tools to optimising existing systems to maximise value and efficiency.\n\nMid-sized firms are focused on balanced growth\n\nAmong mid-sized firms, 58.3% report somewhat increased spending on technology, reflecting a steady and measured approach. These firms often aim to scale their operations without overextending resources, focusing on incremental improvements to existing systems.\n\nSmaller firms are in a catch-up phase\n\nThese firms seem to be focusing on foundational investments like cloud computing and process automation. While they may lack the budgets of larger firms, their investments are driven by the need to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market. These firms often prioritise solutions that deliver immediate efficiency gains without significant risk.\n\n39% of firms are using full-suite solutions\n\nThe results of a recent LinkedIn survey run by Phil Hobden, Silverfin\u2019s Head of Sales, provide valuable insights into the technologies currently being used by accounting practices.\n\nThe findings show that the majority (39%) of respondents are using full-suite software solutions such as Iris, CCH and Digita. These tools, known for their comprehensive features, enable firms to handle multiple aspects of accounting efficiently within a single platform.\n\nInterestingly, 21% of participants reported using specialist software like Caseware and Alphatax, suggesting that many firms are seeking tailored tools to meet specific needs.\n\nSimilarly,18% have transitioned to 100% cloud-based platforms, like Silverfin, highlighting the ongoing shift towards cloud technology for its flexibility and real-time collaboration capabilities.\n\nThe power of cloud computing is evolving\n\nCloud-based accounting software is playing an increasingly important role, making financial data accessible from anywhere and enabling teams to collaborate in real time. This flexibility helps firms manage tasks more efficiently and reduces the risk of errors by automating manual processes.\n\nBeyond these practical benefits, cloud-based software can connect with other tools to create systems that simplify workflows and improve accuracy. For instance, firms can link cloud accounting platforms with tools for analytics, payroll or client management.\n\nRecent investments, such as KPMG\u2019s $100 million partnership with Google Cloud, demonstrate the rising demand for cloud infrastructure. Over the past two years, bookings for KPMG's services related to Google Cloud have increased tenfold.\n\n\"We believe that professional services is going through the largest transformation that it will likely ever go through.\" \u2013 Steve Chase, vice chair of AI and innovation for KPMG\n\nCloud technology and AI are closely linked, as cloud platforms provide the scalable computing power and data storage required to run AI applications effectively. By hosting AI tools on the cloud, firms can process large volumes of data quickly, access advanced analytics, and deploy solutions that adapt to changing needs without investing heavily in on-premises hardware. For instance, AI-driven applications often rely on the cloud to handle complex calculations and store real-time data securely.\n\nAI is being harnessed for the next chapter of growth\n\nIn recent years, AI has rapidly gained traction, evolving from a niche technology into a mainstream trend. Its impact on every industry is undeniable and it has the potential to significantly boost the global economy. PwC estimates AI could add $15.7 trillion by 2030, with $6.6 trillion coming from productivity improvements as businesses automate tasks and enhance efficiency.\n\nIn the UK, AI is expected to contribute \u00a32 billion to GDP, with firms adopting it likely to see revenue grow three times faster than those that don\u2019t. In accounting, AI is improving accuracy, streamlining processes, and helping firms adapt to new challenges, with 61% of accountants seeing it as more of an opportunity than a risk. However, not everyone is fully convinced.\n\nSome accountants are voicing concerns about AI\n\nWhile AI offers exciting possibilities for the accounting profession, it\u2019s not without its challenges. According to a Karbon\u2019s State of AI in Accounting study, many accountants worry about the potential downsides of automation. For instance, 56% are concerned that AI could undermine the \"human touch\" in client relationships, making interactions feel less personal and more transactional.\n\nData security also looms large as a concern, with 76% of respondents identifying it as a key issue. Ethical considerations, such as bias in AI systems and the transparency of AI-driven decisions, trouble nearly half (49%) of accountants surveyed. These worries reflect broader anxieties about how AI will be integrated into professional settings without compromising fairness and accountability.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that AI is far from a replacement for the expertise that accountants bring to their work. Strategic thinking, client understanding and ethical judgment remain areas where human professionals excel. Instead, AI serves as a tool to handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for accountants to strengthen client relationships and add greater value to their firms.\n\nThe road ahead will involve finding a balance \u2013 harnessing AI to drive innovation while preserving the trust, personal connections and ethical foundations that define the profession.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe future of AI in accounting looks bright, with advancements expected to help firms navigate new regulations and deliver more specialised tools for tasks like tax calculations and financial reporting. Emerging technologies such as quantum computing could amplify these benefits, making processes even faster and more efficient. By adopting AI responsibly and addressing its ethical considerations, firms can remain competitive while supporting their teams and clients.\n\nBlockchain technology is another field to watch, with its potential to transform auditing and assurance by automating processes with smart contracts and enhancing transparency. Its decentralised design could be used to reduce the risk of fraud and build trust in financial transactions. This is certainly a new frontier for accounting firms to explore in the years to come!\n\nAs we look ahead to 2025 and beyond, Silverfin is here to help you discover and embrace new possibilities in accounting.

            "article_content": "Tech mogul Elon Musk intensified his legal battle with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in the days after Christmas. Court filings show two prominent tech investors lending support to the billionaire\u2019s allegations that the company unfairly blocked potential backers from investing in its rivals. The dispute between the world\u2019s richest person and one of the world\u2019s most valuable start-ups sets up a potential court battle over OpenAI\u2019s future. The artificial intelligence developer is trying to restructure itself to remove the oversight of its nonprofit board, freeing it to pursue profits more like a conventional tech company.\n\nMusk is asking a federal court in Northern California to block OpenAI from changing its structure, arguing that a nonprofit can\u2019t walk away from its original mandate backed by donors like himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015 and was a major funder of the project before splitting with his co-founders in 2018 after attempting to take control of the project.\n\nThe billionaire also wants OpenAI to be prohibited from forcing its investors to decline to support competing AI companies, such as his own AI start-up, xAI.\n\nMusk\u2019s company, which offers the chatbot Grok, announced $6 billion of new funding last week from investors including Morgan Stanley and an investment fund associated with the Saudi royal family.\n\nAlso last week, progressive tech advocacy organization Encode filed a friend-of-the-court brief expressing support for Musk\u2019s claims against OpenAI. Encode\u2019s filing was backed by several AI researchers, including Geoffrey Hinton, a former Google researcher who shared a Nobel Prize last year for his work on AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused non-profit and made a variety of safety related promises in its charter,\u201d Hinton said in a statement released by Encode. \u201cAllowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kathy Jennings, the attorney general for Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, filed a brief in the case saying she was talking with the company about its plans and would step in if she believed it was breaking the law.\n\nMusk added new support from prominent tech investors to his legal assault on OpenAI in sworn declarations filed late last week by the entrepreneur and three allies.\n\nThey alleged that OpenAI told potential investors last year that they could back the company only if they committed not to invest in rival AI developers, including Musk\u2019s AI start-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAntonio Gracias, CEO of investment firm Valor Equity Partners, which has invested in xAI, said in a filing that it was widely known among investors that OpenAI had made withholding from investments in competitors a provision of its latest funding round.\n\nGavin Baker, managing partner of hedge fund Atreides Management, which has invested in Musk ventures including electric automaker Tesla, said in his own declaration that the competitor investment ban was common knowledge among top tech investors.\n\nGracias and Baker did not claim in the filings to have heard directly from OpenAI\u2019s leaders about the alleged condition placed on prospective investors in the company.\n\nJared Birchall, chief financial officer of Musk\u2019s xAI and a longtime lieutenant to the billionaire, said in his own declaration filed with the court that an unspecified \u201creputable venture capital investor\u201d told him of the restriction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Deutrom, a spokesperson for OpenAI, declined to comment on whether the company had asked investors not to invest in competitors. The company has disputed Musk\u2019s claims in court filings.\n\nAt the New York Times DealBook conference last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said OpenAI investors who also invested in competitors would be cut off from receiving special information on OpenAI\u2019s business. He said in an interview with the Free Press last month that Musk was \u201cclearly a bully.\u201d\n\nThe battle between Musk and Altman, two of the tech world\u2019s most powerful men, erupted into public view last February.\n\nMusk sued OpenAI and Altman that month in state court in San Francisco. He alleged the company\u2019s leaders tricked him and others into supporting a company pledged to bettering humanity, but pivoted it into a for-profit enterprise. He later dropped the suit but filed a similar one in August in federal court in California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI announced in October that it had raised $6.6 billion in new investment funding, valuing the company at $157 billion. The following month, Musk widened his suit to also allege that OpenAI worked with its main backer, Microsoft, to unfairly squash competition in AI. Microsoft has denied the allegations in court filings."

Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs cases\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs \u2014 founder of Bad Boy Records and the Sean John brand \u2014 is due to stand trial in federal court in Manhattan on May 5 on a sex-trafficking indictment that could send him to prison for life. Prosecutors have also warned that a second indictment is imminent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven what's already in the record, trial testimony and evidence will be graphic, and the courtroom jousting will be heated. Combs' defense is that he never forced anyone to have sex, and that his accusers have financial motive to implicate him. The trial will likely focus on consent and credibility.\n\nCombs' mother and his six oldest children \u2014 who range from teenagers to early 30s \u2014 have attended pretrial hearings, waving and smiling at him from the audience. The trial may prove less family-friendly. The evidence includes hundreds of hours of videotape from the rap mogul's sex parties \u2014 especially from his so-called freak-off performances, along with testimony by male sex workers who attended the parties. The trial will not be televised.\n\nSeparately, Combs faces more than 30 civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual abuse. \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted, or sex trafficked anyone,\" his attorneys recently said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuigi Mangione, the suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is awaiting trials on murder charges. Pamela Smith/AP\n\nLuigi Mangione court case\n\nLuigi Mangione, a 26-year-old software developer from a Maryland real estate family, will face state and federal murder charges in Manhattan this year in the December ambush shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. He risks a maximum sentence of life in prison and, in the federal case, the death penalty \u2014 though it has been more than 60 years since a Manhattan jury has sent anyone to death row.\n\nBoth the state and federal prosecutions are in their early days. While Mangione has pleaded not guilty in his state case, he is not set to enter a plea to his federal indictment until later this month.\n\nIt's possible Mangione will go to trial in 2025, though it's unlikely. His attorney suggested prior to taking the case that he could pursue some kind of psychiatric defense, which could delay the trial into 2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump continues to fight for a clean rap sheet and to zero out his civil judgments. AP Photo/Evan Vucci\n\nDonald Trump's court cases\n\nThe president-elect's criminal indictments have sputtered to a halt, thanks in large part to the US Supreme Court's July presidential immunity decision. Loose ends remain in the Manhattan hush-money case, as Trump works to clear his rap sheet of its sole conviction before his January 20 inauguration.\n\nThere is still no sentencing date, and New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan has yet to rule on Trump's demand that the case be tossed in the interest of justice, given the election. Also pending is Trump's Second Circuit appellate efforts to move the hush-money case to federal court.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump begins 2025 with a half-billion-dollars in civil court judgments hanging over his head, all of which he's in the midst of aggressively appealing, including his two E. Jean Carroll defamation cases. A midlevel New York appellate court could keep, trim, or overturn the biggest of Trump's judgments at any time \u2014 his massive civil fraud penalty, a debt to New York state that remains frozen on appeal, which has now ballooned to $490 million with interest. He remains a defendant in eight civil cases brought by injured Capitol Police officers and members of Congress involving his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Supreme Court could strike down the law banning TikTok from app stores. Gearstd/iStock, Tyler Le/BI\n\nTikTok ban\n\nIn the spring, Congress passed a law that would ban TikTok from app stores in the United States unless Bytedance, the platform's Chinese owner, divested itself from the app.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe deadline is January 19. Bytedance still owns TikTok. A Washington, DC-based appeals court was unpersuaded by TikTok's arguments that its users' First Amendment rights outweigh the national security-based reasoning of Congress's law.\n\nAll eyes are on the US Supreme Court to see whether it will strike down the law before the deadline. The court agreed to hear oral arguments in the case on January 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia faces a DOJ probe.

Competitors have said Nvidia uses unfair marketing tactics to gain a stranglehold on the market for chips used in AI development, while the company says it simply offers a best-in-class product. If the DOJ brings a lawsuit or comes to a settlement with Nvidia, it'll likely come in 2025.\n\nMeta faces an antitrust lawsuit.

Now the company is tussling with the Justice Department over how it should be punished. Google suggested it could pull back some of its partnerships with other companies. The DOJ has asked the judge to force Google to divest from its Chrome browser, a more dramatic move. The decision \u2014 and the many appeals to come \u2014 will continue to play out in 2025.\n\nGoogle advertising case\n\nAnother major Google antitrust case is over its role in online advertising. In September, a federal court held a bench trial to determine whether the company formed another illegal monopoly, in the adtech market.\n\nGoogle claims the Justice Department has overstated its role in the market, where it competes fiercely with the likes of Meta and Amazon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA decision is expected to come sometime in 2025, with appeals to follow.\n\nAmazon's antitrust trial is expected in 2026. Amazon\n\nAmazon antitrust lawsuit\n\nIn 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of states sued Amazon, alleging it abused its dominance in the online retail space to inflate prices, squeeze third-party sellers with onerous fees, and push its in-house products at the expense of others. Amazon has said it does everything for the benefit of consumers, to whom it provides better products and better prices.\n\nIn September, a federal judge knocked down some of the states' claims but allowed the bulk of the lawsuit to proceed to trial. The trial date is scheduled for 2026, with more litigation and appeals expected to take place before then.\n\nOpenAI faces a lawsuit by The New York Times.

In January, a federal judge is scheduled to oversee a marathon day of oral arguments over whether the case is on firm enough legal ground to proceed to trial.\n\nElon Musk vs Sam Altman and OpenAI\n\nIn the past few years, OpenAI has become a tech behemoth, setting the pace for generative artificial intelligence technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company is technically structured as a nonprofit that seeks to build artificial intelligence in a way that benefits all of humanity. However, under its leader Sam Altman, OpenAI has signed a lucrative deal with Microsoft, which hopes to harness the tech to drive its own growth.\n\nNow OpenAI is trying to formally convert itself into a for-profit company, shedding the nonprofit label. Musk \u2014 who was involved in OpenAI's early stages and who runs a competitor, xAI \u2014 is trying to stop that from happening.\n\nThe case has been moving at a fast clip, with lawyers for Musk and OpenAI dropping legal filings that reveal internal emails and other records about the other. It's set to continue heating up in 2025 as OpenAI tries to become a corporation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams' administration was in turmoil before he was indicted.

            "article_content": "Metabolite data and AI combine to redefine how we measure aging and predict health spans.\n\nStudy: Metabolomic age (MileAge) predicts health and life span: A comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms. Image Credit: Sergey Tarasov / Shutterstock\n\nIn a recent study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers at King\u2019s College London explored metabolomic aging clocks using machine learning models trained on plasma metabolite data from the United Kingdom (U.K.) Biobank. The study aimed to assess the potential of metabolomic aging clocks in predicting health outcomes and life span by benchmarking their accuracy, robustness, and relevance to biological aging indicators beyond chronological age.\n\nBackground\n\nBiological aging, distinct from chronological age, reflects molecular and cellular damage influencing health and disease susceptibility. Chronological age alone cannot capture the variability in aging-related physiological states among individuals. However, recent advances in omics technologies, particularly metabolomics, have offered insights into biological aging through molecular profiling.\n\nMetabolites, or small molecules from metabolic pathways, can provide assessments of physiological health and are linked to aging-related outcomes, such as chronic diseases and mortality. Earlier studies have correlated metabolomic data with aging but have been constrained by limited sample sizes and markers.\n\nRecent efforts to derive \"aging clocks\" using machine learning from omics data have demonstrated significant predictive power for health outcomes. However, there continue to be challenges in optimizing these models for accuracy and interpretability, especially using metabolomics.\n\nThe current study\n\nThe present study utilized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to analyze plasma metabolite data from the U.K. Biobank, involving 225,212 participants between the ages of 37 and 73 years. The exclusion criteria included pregnancy, data inconsistencies, and extreme metabolite values. The dataset encompassed 168 metabolites representing lipid profiles, amino acids, and glycolysis products.\n\nThe researchers applied 17 machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, tree-based models, and ensemble techniques, to the dataset to develop metabolomic aging clocks. They also used a rigorous nested cross-validation approach to ensure robust model evaluation.\n\nSome of the main preprocessing steps included handling outlier metabolite values and correcting age-prediction biases inherent to the models. The predictive models aimed to estimate chronological age using metabolite profiles, and the differences between predicted and actual ages were defined as the \"MileAge delta.\" Statistical corrections were extensively applied to remove systematic biases and enhance prediction accuracy, particularly for younger and older age ranges.\n\nThe models were evaluated for predictive accuracy using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficients. For example, the Cubist regression model achieved an MAE of 5.31 years, outperforming other models like multivariate adaptive regression splines (MAE = 6.36 years). Further analysis adjusted the predictions to remove systematic biases and improve their alignment with chronological age.\n\nStudy design and overview. (A) Overview of the nested cross-validation approach. MAE, mean absolute error; RMSE, root mean square error. (B) Histogram of the chronological age distribution of the analytical sample. The statistical mode (age, 61 years) is shown in red. (C) Distribution of metabolite levels by chronological age, showing scatter plots of all observations and smooth curves (note the difference in the y-axis scale). The smooth curves were estimated using generalized additive models, with shaded areas corresponding to 95% confidence intervals (CIs). GlycA, glycoprotein acetyls. (D) Scatter plot showing the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality and the beta for chronological age associated with a one SD difference in metabolite levels. Metabolites that had statistically significant associations with both chronological age and all-cause mortality are shown in purple.\n\nResults\n\nThe findings indicated that metabolomic aging clocks developed from plasma metabolite profiles could effectively differentiate biological aging from chronological aging. Of the various models tested in the study, the Cubist rule-based regression model provided the strongest predictive associations with health markers and mortality and outperformed the other algorithms in accuracy and robustness.\n\nAdditionally, positive MileAge delta values, which indicated accelerated aging, were linked to frailty, shorter telomeres, higher morbidity, and increased mortality risk. Specifically, a 1-year increase in MileAge delta corresponded to a 4% rise in all-cause mortality risk, with hazard ratios (HR) exceeding 1.5 in extreme cases.\n\nMoreover, the study showed that individuals with accelerated aging were more likely to report poorer self-rated health and experience chronic illnesses. Associations with frailty and telomere attrition were particularly pronounced, with some differences being equivalent to an 18-year disparity in frailty index scores. Interestingly, women exhibited slightly higher MileAge deltas than men across most models.\n\nThe study also confirmed the non-linear nature of metabolite-age relationships and emphasized the utility of statistical corrections in enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, comparing existing aging markers showed that metabolomic aging clocks captured unique health-relevant signals and often outperformed the simpler predictors. However, the results highlighted that decelerated aging (negative MileAge deltas) did not consistently translate into better health outcomes, underscoring the complexity of biological aging metrics.\n\nConclusions\n\nOverall, the study demonstrated the utility of metabolomic aging clocks in predicting biological aging and associated health outcomes. By benchmarking multiple machine learning algorithms, the findings also showed the superior performance of the Cubist rule-based model in linking metabolite-derived ages to health markers and mortality.\n\nThe results suggested that metabolomic aging clocks hold potential for proactive health management and risk stratification and emphasized the need for further validation across diverse populations and longitudinal data for broader clinical application. This study sets a new benchmark for algorithm development, illustrating how metabolomic profiles can offer actionable insights into aging and health."

            "article_content": "E-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN -0.86%) trounced the market in 2024, with its share price climbing 45% compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC -0.43%) 24% gains (as of this writing). Meanwhile, Home Depot's (HD -0.11%) shares struggled, gaining just 12.4% for the year amid a slowdown in DIY home improvement spending.\n\nBoth of these consumer goods companies are leaders in their respective markets and, while their current share price gains don't compare, either could be great long-term investments. But which is the better buy right now? Let's take a look.\n\nThe case for Amazon\n\nAmazon is, of course, a dominant e-commerce company that also has its hands in a range of things from cloud computing to artificial intelligence (AI). While not all of its endeavors are successful, many avenues Amazon pursues often work out well for the company, making the stock a no-brainer buy for many investors.\n\nConsider that Amazon has 40% of the U.S. e-commerce market, easily outpacing rival Walmart, which has just over 7% market share. This lead translates to massive sales, with North American revenue rising 9% in the third quarter (ended Sept. 30) to $95.5 billion.\n\nAmazon recently launched a new, lower-priced version of its marketplace called Amazon Haul to maintain its lead and fight off increasing competition. The mobile-only e-commerce platform is Amazon's answer to China-based Temu (owned by PDD Holdings) and gives U.S. customers access to items priced under $20.\n\nThat move should help Amazon stay even more competitive in e-commerce, but it's the company's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), that is the true key to its success.\n\nAWS' operating income rose nearly 50% in the third quarter to $10.4 billion, and Amazon likely has many more years of AWS growth ahead of it. The company already holds 31% of the cloud computing market, and spending on cloud data centers is accelerating. Goldman Sachs estimates revenue from the entire cloud computing market will reach $2 trillion by 2030, thanks to a rapid increase in AI spending.\n\nSome investors may overlook Amazon because they believe its best days are behind it, but with the company's continued dominance in e-commerce and its expanding cloud operating income as AI investments accelerate, there's likely more growth ahead for Amazon.\n\nThe case for Home Depot\n\nHome Depot is the leader in DIY home improvement, with more than $40 billion in sales in the third quarter (ended Oct. 27), compared to rival Lowe's $20 billion in revenue. But despite its lead, Home Depot is struggling a bit.\n\nThe company's same-store sales fell 1.3% compared to the year-ago quarter, an indication that customers aren't as eager to walk through its doors and make purchases as they were this time last year. Home Depot management doesn't expect the remainder of the year to be much better, estimating a 2.5% decline in comparable sales for the fiscal year.\n\nThe North American home improvement market was worth $667 billion in 2023 and will reach an estimated $1.2 trillion by 2032. While Home Depot will benefit from this, the current slowdown in customer spending means the company will have to wait a little longer before customers are eager to jump into DIY projects again.\n\n\"We continue to see pressure on larger remodeling projects, driven by the higher interest rate environment and continued macroeconomic uncertainty,\" Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said during the most recent earnings call. Decker is optimistic that demand will return to normal, but added, \"We just don't think we're quite there yet.\"\n\nThe verdict: Amazon is the better buy now\n\nHome Depot's shares have a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24.8, compared to Amazon's forward P/E ratio of 35.7. That makes Home Depot's stock less expensive than Amazon's, but I still don't think it's the better buy.\n\nIf the housing market has shown anything over the past few years, it's that no one can reliably predict where it's going. Home Depot's management doesn't seem confident that it's out of the woods just yet with comparable-store sales slowdowns, which means it might be better to put your money toward Amazon's stock for now.\n\nOf course, if you're willing to be patient for home improvement spending to increase again, adding some Home Depot stock amid its recent share price pullback probably isn't a bad idea either."

            "article_content": "Centralized data networks, ones that are owned and/or managed by a single entity, have been structurally broken for years. Why? Single points of failure. If one entity (or even a few) has access to a database, then there is only one \u201cpoint\u201d to compromise in order to gain full access. This is a serious problem for networks holding sensitive data like customer information, government files, and financial records, and those with control of infrastructure like power grids.\n\nBillions of digital records were stolen in 2024 alone, causing an estimated $10 trillion in damages! Notable breaches include nearly all of AT&T\u2019s customer information and call logs, half of America\u2019s personal health information, 700 million end-user records from companies using Snowflake, 10 billion unique passwords stored on RockYou24, and Social Security records for 300 million Americans.\n\nSource: Statista, 2024\n\nThis is not just a private sector issue \u2014 governments and crucial national infrastructure also rely on centralized networks. Notable recent breaches include records on 22 million Americans stolen from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, sensitive government communications from multiple U.S. federal agencies, personal biometric data on 1.1 billion Indian citizens, and the ongoing Chinese infiltration of several U.S. internet service providers.\n\nAlthough hundreds of billions of dollars are spent each year on cyber security, data breaches are getting larger and happening more frequently. It\u2019s become clear that incremental products cannot fix these network vulnerabilities \u2014 the infrastructure must be completely rearchitected.\n\nSource: market.us, 2024\n\nAI magnifies the issue\n\nRecent advancements in generative AI have made it easier to automate everyday tasks and enhance work productivity. But the most useful and valuable AI applications require context, i.e. access to sensitive user health, financial, and personal information. Because these AI models also require massive computing power, they largely can\u2019t run on consumer devices (computer, mobile), and instead must access public cloud networks, like AWS, to process more complex inference requests. Given the serious limitations inherent in centralized networks illustrated earlier, the inability to securely connect sensitive user data with cloud AI has become a significant hurdle for adoption.\n\nEven Apple pointed this out during their announcement for Apple Intelligence earlier this year, stating the need to be able to enlist help from larger, more complex models in the cloud and how the traditional cloud model isn\u2019t viable anymore.\n\nThey name three specific reasons:\n\nPrivacy and security verification: Providers' claims, like not logging user data, often lack transparency and enforcement. Service updates or infrastructure troubleshooting can inadvertently log sensitive data. Runtime lacks transparency: Providers rarely disclose software details, and users cannot verify if the service runs unmodified or detect changes, even with open-source tools. Single point of failure: Administrators require high-level access for maintenance, risking accidental data exposure or abuse by attackers targeting these privileged interfaces.\n\nFortunately, Web3 cloud platforms offer the perfect solution.\n\nBlockchain-Orchestrated Confidential Cloud (BOCC)\n\nBOCC networks are like AWS \u2014 except built completely on confidential hardware and governed by smart contracts. Though still early days, this infrastructure has been in development for years and is finally starting to onboard Web3 projects and Web2 enterprise customers. The best example of this architecture is Super Protocol, an off-chain enterprise-grade cloud platform managed completely by on-chain smart contracts and built on trustless execution environments (TEEs). These are secure hardware enclaves that keep code and data verifiably confidential and secure.\n\nSource: Super Protocol\n\nThe implications of this technology address all of Apple\u2019s concerns noted earlier:\n\nPrivacy and security verification: With public smart contracts orchestrating the network, users can verify whether user data was transported and used as promised. Workload and program transparency: The network also verifies the work done within the confidential TEEs, cryptographically proving the correct hardware, data, and software were used, and that the output wasn\u2019t tampered with. This information is also submitted on-chain for all to audit. Single point of failure: Network resources (data, software, hardware) are only accessible by the owner\u2019s private key. Therefore, even if one user is compromised, only that user\u2019s resources are at risk.\n\nWhile cloud AI represents an enormous opportunity for Web3 to disrupt, BOCCs can be applied to any type of centralized data network (power grid, digital voting infrastructure, military IT, etc.), to provide superior and verifiable privacy and security, without sacrificing performance or latency. Our digital infrastructure has never been more vulnerable, but blockchain-orchestration can fix it."

            "article_content": "As we approach 2025, the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve at a breakneck speed. I've witnessed numerous trends come and go, but the next few years promise to bring some of the most significant changes we've seen in decades. Let's dive into what I believe will be the most impactful developments in cybersecurity for 2025.\n\nThe Rise of Autonomous AI-Driven Security\n\nOne of the most exciting developments on the horizon is the emergence of AI-driven Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) systems. These advanced platforms will take threat detection and response to a new level, operating autonomously in real-time without human intervention.\n\nThese AI-driven systems will provide a much-needed edge for defenders, allowing them to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that while AI will become a powerful tool in our arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. Human expertise will still be vital in overseeing these systems and handling complex scenarios that require nuanced decision-making.\n\nThe Looming Threat to Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhile technological advancements offer new defensive capabilities, the threat landscape changes to reflect the digitization of our critical services. In 2025, it\u2019s possible we may witness a successful cyber-attack against critical national infrastructure, likely orchestrated by a nation-state actor. This attack could potentially bring large regions of a country to a standstill, highlighting the vulnerabilities in our increasingly connected systems.\n\nThis scenario underscores the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures in critical infrastructure sectors. Governments and organizations must prioritize the protection of these vital systems, implementing a strong security culture and fostering international cooperation to mitigate such threats.\n\nEvolution of Disinformation and Misinformation Campaigns\n\nInformation warfare is a popular tactic in times of uncertainty and therefore we're seeing a disturbing trend towards the professionalization of criminal tools and services that seek to exploit this. It wouldn\u2019t be unexpected to see sophisticated, purpose-built deepfake tools and even \"disinformation-as-a-service\" offerings in the cybercriminal underground.\n\nThese advancements will enable cybercriminals to launch more convincing and damaging attacks. Disinformation campaigns could be used to accelerate extortion, hide other attacks, target senior officials or damage an organization's reputation. As such, the line between a cyber-attack and information warfare will become increasingly blurred.\n\nTo combat this, organizations will need to invest heavily in detection technologies and employee training. The ability to quickly identify and respond to disinformation will become a critical skill, not only for security teams, but the wider workforce as well.\n\nGeopolitical Influences on Cybersecurity\n\nThe cybersecurity landscape doesn't exist in a vacuum. Geopolitical tensions will continue to shape the threat landscape for organizations worldwide. State-sponsored cyber activities, hacktivism and cyber espionage will likely increase, making it crucial for organizations to stay informed about global political developments and their potential cybersecurity implications.\n\nThis geopolitical dimension will require cybersecurity professionals to develop a broader understanding of international relations and to work more closely with other departments within their organisations to develop comprehensive risk management strategies.\n\nThe Zero Trust Mindset and Cyber-Mindfulness\n\nMore organizations will adopt a zero-trust mindset and cyber-mindfulness culture. These approaches focus on addressing human risk management, recognizing that people are often the weakest link in cybersecurity.\n\nZero trust architecture assumes no user or system should be trusted by default, even if they're already inside the network perimeter. This approach, combined with a culture of cyber-mindfulness where every employee is actively engaged in security practices, will significantly enhance an organization's overall security posture.\n\nAdvancements in Deepfake Detection\n\nAs deepfake technology becomes more sophisticated, so too will our ability to detect it. By 2025, I expect significant improvements in deepfake AI detection technology. These advancements will reduce false positives for generated audio and video, and importantly, become more accessible for consumers to use.\n\nThis democratization of deepfake detection technology will be crucial in combating the spread of misinformation and protecting individuals and organizations from sophisticated impersonation attacks.\n\nRenewed Focus on the Human Element of Security\n\nThe reality is that an organization\u2019s employees represent the largest attack surface, as well as its greatest line of defense. In fact, the human aspect of cybersecurity has often been overlooked, leaving employees susceptible and making them a prime target for cybercriminals.\n\nAccording to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 2024, human error or involvement plays a role in 82% of data breaches and so more attention needs to be brought to this issue and transform employees from being potential liabilities into assets, creating a \"human firewall\" to protect the organization.\n\nAs we look towards 2025, it's clear that the cybersecurity landscape will be characterised by both exciting advancements and daunting challenges. The rise of AI-driven security systems, the increasing sophistication of cyber threats and the growing importance of geopolitical factors in cybersecurity will reshape our approach to digital protection.\n\nOrganizations and individuals alike must stay informed, adaptable, and proactive in their cybersecurity strategies. By embracing new technologies, fostering a culture of security awareness and maintaining a global perspective, we can navigate the complex cybersecurity landscape of 2025 and beyond."

            "article_content": "\u201cWith pain,\u201d says Pope Francis, I think of Gaza, of so much cruelty , of the children being machine-gunned, of the bombings of schools and hospitals. What cruelty!\" The Pontiff is worked up, impatient, angry. He wants an unspecified court to decide in his favour \u2013 Israel is committing genocide\n\nIn fact the Pontiff could settle the matter for himself in ten minutes. The \u2018discovery\u2019, to use lawyers\u2019 jargon, will not be to his liking. What exactly should the applicant Google to obtain compelling evidence that Israel has a record of trying to exterminate a Muslim population? Most would Google, \u2018Israel/Gaza/genocide\u2019 \u2013 the wrong track. It yields nothing better than stock opinions which a rookie counsel might quash before a Pope can say, \u2018From the river to the sea.\u2019 A Vatican team worth its salt will Google \u2018Plight of Christianity\u2019. To zoom onto the Middle East, it could do no better than click on the link above.\n\nThe totality of evidence discovered can make a summing up statement well nigh impregnable. Under Muslim sovereignty the plight of Christianity is dire. Under Jewish sovereignty, opposite to plight, Christianity grows. The Pope alleging that genocide is in the wind is directed at the wrong door. His Holiness must not even try going to reliably anti-Israel Wikipedia. He will find there the galling truth confirmed that, \u201cChristians are on the verge of extinction in the Middle East\u201d. It is elsewhere than Gaza he will discover proof of genocide. Rather than committing it, Israel is fighting it; doing so for Jews no less than for Catholics and Protestants. No doubt the papal gut will find digesting the truth a painful process.\n\nThe loci of Israel\u2019s fighting genocide used to be the \u2018Palestinian territories\u2019 where 99% of Palestinians live . That was before the horrors of Oct 7, 2023. Then its fight spilled over the borders into Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iran \u2013 all listed in Open Doors\u2019 World Watch as countries where Christians face \u201cvery high or extreme levels\u201d of persecution. For reason known to itself, Open Doors steers clear of the \u2018Palestinian territories\u2019. But no matter - into the breach steps the Jerusalem Centre of Public Affairs.\n\n\u201cDemographics don\u2019t lie,\u201d declares the title of the JCPA\u2019s December 2024 report. The subtitle reveals which demographics don\u2019t lie: \u201cThe Christian population within the Palestinian Authority and under Hamas is declining.\u201d Factors cited are the lack of police protection, work discrimination, harassment, coercion to convert to Islam, and types of socio-economic hardship.\n\nDemographics in Gaza also don\u2019t lie. From the time Israel abandoned the strip to Palestinian control in 2005, Christians have dwindled from 5,000 to 1,100 in October 2023, on the eve of the war in Gaza.\n\nWhat of the so-called, \u2018West Bank\u2019? Practically synonymous with Christianity, Bethlehem hardly has a better record than Gaza. When the city came under the Muslim dominated Palestinian Authority in 1994 Bethlehem was, \u201cThe most populous Christian town in the Holy Land.\u201d Christians at this time made up 15% of all residents, By 2020 they were down to no more than 5%. On Christmas day 2024, not more than a small element remained to celebrate the birth of Jesus \u2013 to a Jewish couple. The beleaguered contingent bemoaned that Ramallah, the central seat of Muslim government, had hijacked Christian holidays. \u201c Jesus was born in Bethlehem, not Ramallah ,\u201d a tour guide reminds the Palestinian Authority. \u201cWhat the Palestinian leadership is doing is an insult to not only Bethlehem but all Christians.\u201d\n\nHold onto where Jesus was born and highjacked. His Holiness plays the highjacking game when he swaddles Christ in a Palestinian keffiyeh. Since the garment is a worldwide symbol of \u2018resistance\u2019, the catchword for Islamic sovereignty over the Holy Land, the Pope converting Jesus into a Palestinian (Arab?) follows hard on its heels. These embattled thoughts of the Bishop of Rome are out of sync with Catholicism. And so we arrive at some critical clues into delusion-caused blindness. The Pope divorcing Jesus from Judaism may account for a refusal to accept that Christianity under Israeli sovereignty has fared close to faultlessly.\n\nDemographics don\u2019t lie. According to a 2021 poll, 84% of Israeli Christians were satisfied with life in Israel. It ties in neatly with a new report by Israel\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics. Far from the dwindling trend in \u2018Palestinian territories\u2019, the Christian population in Israel portrays growth at a steady rate. In December 2023 there were some 190,000 Israeli Christians, increasing their proportion to 1.9% of the total. A year-on-year growth of 1.2% consolidated a long term upward trend. \u201cAs opposed to the trend in many countries of the Middle East,\u201d says the report, \u201cIsrael reflects a different reality.\u201d\n\nThere are further conclusive indicators of a \u201cdifferent reality\u201d, of Israel being a Christian haven . Nine churches are officially recognized, including the Roman Catholic and Armenian Catholic churches. Secondly, Arab Christians happen to be the most educated ethnic group in Israel. \"The Christian number is increasing because of freedom of religion ,\" says Pastor Petra Heldt, a leading Christian scholar and Israel resident for 40 years. \"This is not true of Muslim-majority countries in the region.\"\n\nYet the Pope reacts to Israel as he would to a slap in the face. Why is that?\n\nA commonplace explanation is that the Argentinean prelate is cowardly.\n\n\u201cPerhaps he believes that pointing a finger at the Jews will divert Muslim rage from the Vatican. Perhaps he believes it distracts the world from his own cowardice and failure to protect Christians.\u201d\n\nThere must be truth in this; Protestant leaders display the identical fear. The now disgraced Anglican leader, Archbishop Justin Welby , had Pope Francis\u2019 fear. One, Welby treated Muslims with kid gloves and two, he looked on his persecuted flock as sacrificial lambs. It therefore stands to reason what buckles the Pontiff\u2019s pink knees: his pathetic fear. Thus far it explains him but no further.\n\nA Pope prostituting the Messiah simply to divert and distract from his gross cowardice? Would he really go that far? The fact is, he shares a trait which is common to leading clerics of different churches. This involves borrowing the Messiah to have a go at the Jews. If politicised Protestants can do it, and 3rd Reich Hitler-loyal clerics could do it, why not a Woke Pontiff? Francis may be well be driven by Jew-hatred pure and simple, to abandon the Old Testament and the Gospels, and subvert Jesus into a divine zealot for the Palestinian Arab cause.\n\nThere is no lack of modern precedents. Kairos borrows Christ not to beat swords into ploughshares and spears into pruning hooks, rather for daily all-too human acts. Rather than Jesus walking on water, Kairos gets him to walk through a military checkpoint manned by Israelis.\n\nFor another precedent, at the Bethlehem \u2018Christ at the Checkpoint Conference\u2019, clerics debated what Jesus would do and say, if he had to cope with the \u2018Occupation\u2019. How would the Messiah deal with the anger and bitterness Palestinians feel? Munther Isaac, Dean of Bethlehem Bible College, stepped into the Son of God\u2019s big shoes to address this captivating idea.\n\nThe applications of Jesus seem endless. His agony on the cross is not immune to abuse. An Easter sermon by Arab Protestant Naim Ateek , draws a most bizarre image regarding this.\n\n\u201cIt seems that Jesus is on the cross again with thousands of crucified Palestinians around him, said Ateek. \u201cThe Israeli government\u2019s crucifixion system is operating daily.\u201d\n\nIn short, Gospel narratives are cunningly worked into anti-Semitic propaganda. The United Church of Christ, embarrassed by the New Testament testifying to Jews living in a land they were supposed to have pinched from Palestinian Arabs in the 20th Century, reverts to the canard of Zionist colonizers.\n\nApparently therefore, outrage for Palestinian Arabs living under the Jews, though far better off than their brethren rotting and dying under Muslims, is a way to go to heaven. Curse Israel and God will bless you.\n\nIs Pope Francis another high priest of anti-Zionism? He would not be the first anti-Israel Pope. The Vatican\u2019s refusal in 1948 to recognize the newly declared State of Israel was not pro-Arab bias, but an issue of dogma. Nor is the Vatican out on a limb. The World Council of Churches, the Presbyterians of America, the Greek Orthodox and diverse clerics, think in St Augustine\u2019s terms. Get the hell out of Palestine. After you rejected Christ you lost your place as the Chosen. Go back to being the witness wanderers God meant you to be.\n\nNot only Christianity thinks like this. Israel\u2019s rise from Holocaust ashes troubles secular anti-Zionists. Their problem is not doctrinal but perceptual. The anti-Zionist cannot come to terms with such a thing as a military Jew. The stereotype of the Jew of old \u2013 a bearded bookish stateless wanderer \u2013 could never have evolved into a mean machine. What vinegary thoughts turn on Israel, what sourball gaze at the juggernaut Jew. Get the hell out! Go back to your natural born fate.\n\nSo there we are; a Pope who is driven to defame the un-chosen people. Israel\u2019s destiny was never to make the desert bloom; to build a Tel Aviv of Manhattan skyscrapers; to win Nobel Prizes by the wheelbarrow full; to boast a bustling high-tech economy stronger than Italy\u2019s; to be a rare and isolated haven for blessed Arab Christians. The Pontiff\u2019s pores leak not envy but error, the faith-losing error of dogma. We now have the cause of his dogmatic angst and bluster: the spoilage of the plot, the shattering of the icon.\n\nSteve Apfel is an international authority on anti-Zionism and a prolific author published on many sites and journals since 2003.

In this case, the women looked for patterns in the starlight and recorded changes to the visible stars. Payne, under a graduate fellowship, had a different role from the other women.\n\nHer mentor Harlow Shapley initially urged Payne to continue the work of a computer, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, who had realized that variations in some stars\u2019 light could be used to measure distances. But Payne wasn\u2019t interested in Leavitt\u2019s project. \u201cInstead, she wanted to focus on the decades of mostly untouched spectroscopy plates,\u201d says Burns.\n\nNo institution had more of those emulsion plates preserving star signatures than Harvard. Another computer, Annie Jump Cannon, had started to classify stars based on their signatures. Payne wanted to build on this work, combining what she learned about the inner workings of atoms at Newnham with the recent scientific theories of physics and chemistry, to understand stars.\n\nThe physics of the stars\n\nPhysics research was accelerating at the time, and the discoveries and scientific theories were traveling across the globe.\n\nResearchers had figured out the source of the patterns on spectroscopy plates\u2014electrons shifting energy levels as they zipped around an atom\u2019s nucleus, an action that emits or absorbs light. The color of that light was specific to a particular atom, meaning an electron in a carbon atom would always absorb or emit the same amount of light to reach a zippier state or drop back to a relaxed state. Within a few years, experiments determined most of energies that kick electrons to different levels for many of the atomic elements."

            "article_content": "The Cuban Revolution was an armed uprising in Cuba that overthrew the government of Fulgencio Batista on January 1, 1959\n\nThe Cuban Revolution was an armed uprising in Cuba that overthrew the government of Fulgencio Batista on January 1, 1959. The revolution\u2019s leader, Fidel Castro, went on to rule Cuba from 1959 to 2008. This article highlights the significance of this revolution and the revolutionary transformation of Latin America.\n\nOne day, Che said to the guerrilla fighters in Bolivia: \u201cThis type of fight gives us the opportunity of becoming revolutionaries, the highest level of the human species, and it also permits us to graduate as men; those that cannot reach either of these two stages should say so and give up the fight.\u201d\n\nThose that fought with them until the end have become worthy of such honours. They symbolise the type of revolutionaries and men whom history is now summoning for a truly hard and difficult task: the revolutionary transformation of Latin America.\n\nThe enemy which faced our forefathers during the first fight for independence was a decadent colonial power. The revolutionaries of today have as their enemy the most powerful bulwark of the imperialist camp, equipped with the most modern techniques and industries. This enemy not, only newly organized equipped the Bolivian army, where the people had destroyed the previous military repressive forces and immediately helped with weapons and military assistants for the fight against the guerrillas, but they also offer military and technical aid to the same degree to all the repressive forces on this continent. And when these measures were not sufficient, they intervened directly with their troops, as they did in Santo Domingo.\n\nThe North American people themselves, who are becoming conscious of the fact that the monstrous political superstructure which prevails in their country is no longer the idyllic. The bourgeois republic established by its founders almost two hundred years ago, is undergoing to an ever greater degree the moral barbarousness of an irrational, obsessed, brutal and inhuman system which engulfs more victims from among the North American people in its aggressive wars, political crimes, racial aberration, niggardly regard for the human being, and the repugnant squandering of economic, scientific and human resources. All these events happen in the middle of a world which is seventy five per cent underdeveloped and hungry.\n\nBut only the revolutionary transformation of Latin America could permit the people of the United States to settle accounts with imperialism itself. At the same time and at the same rate the rising struggle of the North American people against imperialist policy could become a decisive ally of the revolutionary struggle in Latin America.\n\nIf this part of the hemisphere does not undergo a profound revolutionary transformation, the enormous difference and lack of balance at the beginning of the century between this powerful nation - which was rapidly industrialised at the same rate as it progressed by its own law of social and economic dynamics toward imperial heights - and the group of weak and thwarted nations in the other Balkanised part of the American continent will be but a pale reflection. A reflection of not the already great lack of economic, scientific and technical balance which now exists, but of the frightful lack of balance which the imperialist superstructure will impose at a greater speed on the peoples of Latin America in the next twenty years.\n\nThis way we shall become poorer, weaker and more dependent upon and enslaved by imperialism. This dark perspective equally affects the underdeveloped countries of Asia and Africa.\n\nIf the industrialised and well-instructed nations of Europe, with their Common Market and supranational scientific institutions become perturbed by the possibility of getting left behind and contemplate with fear the perspective of being converted into economic colonies of Yankee imperialism, what does the future have to offer to the peoples of Latin America?\n\nIf this real and unquestionable situation decisively affects the destiny of our peoples, some liberal or bourgeois reformist or pseudo-revolutionary charlatan, incapable of action, may have an answer that is not for a profound and urgent revolutionary transformation. It could gather together all the moral, material and human forces to launch them forth in this part of the world in order to recover from the economic and scientific-technical backwardness of centuries, greater when compared to the industrialised world of which we are tributaries, and will continue to be a greater degree, especially of the United States \u2013 and furthermore is able to give the formula, the magic way to accomplish this, different from the way conceived by Che. In turn it can wipe out oligarchies, despots, petty politicians, that is to say, nursemaids, and Yankee monopolies, the masters, and to be able to do it with all the urgency which the situation requires.\n\nChe wrote his last line on October 7. The following day, at 13 hours, in a narrow ravine where he proposed waiting for the night in order to break the encirclement, a large number of enemy troops made contact with them. The reduced number of men of which the detachment was composed on this date, fought heroically until dusk from individual positions located in the bed of the ravine and on the top edges against the mass of soldiers that had surrounded and attacked them. Among those who fought in positions close to Che, there were no survivors. Besides him were the doctor, in a grave state of health, and a Peruvian guerrilla, also in bad condition, which seems to indicate that Che, until wounded, did his utmost to protect the withdrawal of these two comrades to a more secure place. The doctor was not killed during the same battle but several days later at a not very distant point from the Quebrada del Yuro. The abruptness of the rocky irregular terrain made visual contact among the guerrilla fighters very difficult and at times impossible. Those defending the position at the other entrance of the ravine several hundred metres from Che, among them Inti and Coco Peredo, held off the attack until dusk when they managed to get away from the enemy and left for the previously agreed point of contact.\n\nIt has been established that Che continued fighting, though wounded until the barrel of his M-2 rifle was destroyed by a shot, rendering it completely useless. The pistol he was carrying had no magazine. These incredible circumstances explain how he could have been captured alive. The wounds in his legs kept him from walking without help but they were not fatal.\n\nMoved to the town of Higueras, he lived approximately 24 hours more. He refused to exchange words with his captors and a drunken officer who tried to vex him received a slap across the face.\n\nGathered in La Paz, Barrientos, Ovando and other high military chiefs coldly made the decision to assassinate him. The details of the way they proceeded to carry out the treacherous agreement at the school in the town of Higueras are well known. Majo Miguel Ayoroa and Colonel Andres Selnich, rangers trained by the Yankees, instructed officer Mario Teran to proceed with the killing. When the latter, completely drunk, went into the place, Che, who had heard the shots which had just killed a Bolivian and a Peruvian guerrilla fighter, seeing that the assassin vacillated said firmly, \u201cShoot, don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d The latter left and again it was necessary for his superiors, Ayoroa and Selnich, to repeat the order, which he then proceeded to fulfill, firing with his machine-gun from the waist down. Word had already gone around that Che had died several hours after combat and therefore his executors had orders not to shoot at his chest or head so as not to induce fatal wounds. Such a procedure is in brutal contrast to the respect that Che had, without a single exception, for the lives of numerous officials and soldiers of the Bolivian army whom he had taken prisoner.\n\nThe final hours of his existence in the power of his despised enemies must have been very bitter ones for him, but there was no man better prepared than Che to be put to such a test.\n\nThe way that the Diary came into our hands cannot be divulged at the moment; it is enough to say that it required no monetary remuneration. It contains all the notes he wrote from November 7, 1966, the day Che arrived at Nancahuazu, until October 7, 1967, the evening before the combat in the ravine in Yuro. There are only a few pages missing which are not in our hands but they correspond to dates on which nothing of any importance took place and therefore do not alter the content of the Diary in any way.\n\nAlthough there was no doubt as to the authenticity of the document, all the photo static copies were submitted to a rigorous examination for the purpose not only of proving the authenticity but also to check on any possible alteration, no matter how small. Furthermore, the data was compared with the diary of one of the surviving guerrillas. Both documents coincide in all respects. The detailed testimony of the remaining guerrilla survivors who were witnesses to each and every one of the events also contributes to the proof of its authenticity. The conclusion was reached with absolute certainty that all the Photostats were true copies of Che\u2019s Diary.\n\nIt was a fatiguing job to decipher the small and difficult handwriting, a task carried out with the laborious participation of his wife and comrade, Aleida March de Guevara.\n\nThe Diary was published almost simultaneously in France, by the French Editorial Francois Maspero; in Italy by the Editorial Feltrinelli; Trikont Verlag of the German Federal Republic ; the Ramparts Magazine in USA; Ediciones Ruedo Iberico in Spain ; Revista Punto Final in Chile and in other countries."
