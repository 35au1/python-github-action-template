This data is then used to create highly personalized AI family members that can engage in regular video messages, text messaging, voice calls and even participate in video calls. \"Familia.AI's goal isn't to replace human connections, but to enhance where possible and preserve them,\" Luvaglio emphasized. \"Familia.AI is using AI technology that allows families to bridge gaps of time and distance, offering support, preserving memories, and strengthening bonds across generations.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLink Between Family Trauma & Loneliness\n\nThe launch of Familia.AI comes at a time when studies show an increasing need for emotional support and family connection:\n\n67% of young adults report that problems at home or with parents have affected their mental health in later life [1].\n\n42% of individuals attribute their struggles with forming healthy relationships to difficult family dynamics during childhood [2].\n\n78% of therapy patients discuss family-related issues as a significant factor in their emotional challenges [3].\n\nRecent research has highlighted the strong connection between family trauma and loneliness. A 2024 study found that individuals who experienced family trauma were 3.5 times more likely to report chronic loneliness in adulthood [4]. This loneliness has been linked to a range of negative health outcomes, including increased risk of depression, anxiety, and even physical health problems [5].\n\nDr. Chen elaborates, \"Family trauma doesn't just affect our relationships with family members; it can fundamentally alter how we connect with others throughout our lives. Many individuals who've experienced family trauma struggle with trust, intimacy, and self-worth, which can lead to profound and persistent feelings of loneliness.\"\n\nFamilia.AI aims to address these challenges by providing a safe, supportive environment where users can experience positive family interactions, preserve cherished memories, and maintain connections with loved ones past and present. By doing so, the company is actively working to break cycles of family trauma, combat loneliness, and foster healthier emotional development across generations.\n\nAs the company looks to build on its unique AI family service, it remains committed to ethical AI development and user safety. \"I believe Familia.AI is pioneering new territory in AI and I'm happy to support the business,\" says Luvaglio.\n\nAbout Familia.AI\n\nFamilia.AI is an AI-powered app creating personalized digital family members that fill the gaps in family networks and preserve cherished family memories for future generations. By offering personalized family AI companions, Familia.AI's mission is to support and preserve human connections in an age where technology can be a force for emotional well-being.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Johnson, A. et al.

        "article_content": "Joanna MacGugan\n\nSpecial to Worcester Magazine\n\nImagine sitting in the dark in a tiny, shabby cabin where enslaved people once prepared meals for the residents of the mansion next door. It\u2019s after midnight. You\u2019ve scattered video cameras around the cabin. You ask questions about the lives of those who labored here, and you hope that you\u2019ve captured their answers on your audio recorders. You glance down a short passageway and watch, saucer eyed, as a video camera launches itself off a wicker chair for no discernible reason.\n\nOnce you recover from your shock, you try to recreate and debunk it. You can\u2019t. Could it possibly be something paranormal?\n\nExperiences like this often lead me to reflect on the unexpected turns life can take. Sometimes you land someplace completely weird, and you find a sense of belonging you never expected. After 15 years of training as a historian, I assumed a traditional teaching job would be waiting for me after graduation. Instead, I\u2019m investigating reportedly haunted houses and writing about them. Looking back, the leap from scholar to paranormal investigator might not be as strange as it seems because I investigate to better understand history.\n\nMore:Connell Sanders: Mama loves to rock, and baby's along for the big noise\n\nMore:Last Call: Historian looks for clues to life, death and justice in medieval Ireland\n\nEven when we can\u2019t verify something we learn from an investigation as historical truth, the story becomes an important part of the haunted location\u2019s lore. And when the historical record matches up with our paranormal experiences, we\u2019ve struck gold.\n\nI\u2019ve found my favorite people in the paranormal community. We share more than a love for all things spooky; we\u2019re connected by curiosity and a desire to tell the stories of those who have passed. We bond over experiences that nobody else would understand.\n\nWe also support each other\u2019s creative pursuits; we are writers, photographers, filmmakers and musicians. And the best paranormal conventions (or paracons) feel more like family reunions than your ordinary geeky gatherings. There\u2019s the darker side of the paranormal community, too \u2014 the big egos, fame-seekers and petty drama. But it\u2019s easy enough to look past them and find the people you want on your team. I\u2019ve joined countless paranormal investigations in the U.S. and the U.K., and I\u2019ve met kindred spirits who are now lifelong friends.\n\nWhen we investigate haunted places, we protect each other. We learn our teammates\u2019 body language, and we recognize when they\u2019re uncomfortable and need to leave the scene. Our camaraderie often dispels tension in places where traumatic events happened.\n\nSometimes we catch the best electric voice phenomena (also known as EVPs; unexplained voices imprinted on audio recordings) when we\u2019re relaxed and trading lighthearted banter \u2014 the kind that comes from people who genuinely like each other. There\u2019s no judgment. We understand each other, and we know that our experiences are real. We don\u2019t really care if other people might think we\u2019re bonkers.\n\n\u201cCommunity\u201d means something different for everyone. Since I found mine, I\u2019ve learned what it feels like to let my guard down and embrace the weird, because we\u2019re all weirdos at heart. If hanging out in haunted places after dark and hoping for an experience you can\u2019t explain is your idea of a good time, come celebrate the weird with us. You\u2019re always going to be welcome in the paranormal community.\n\nJoanna MacGugan is a social historian, copy editor, and paranormal investigator. She is currently writing a history of the Peter Oliver House in Middleborough."

Experts who study gender bias in the sciences say the Nobel\u2019s gender gap reflects the larger barriers to success faced by women in science \u2014 and that science is poorer for it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe men who received this year\u2019s prizes are \u201csuperstars,\u201d said Liselotte Jauffred, a physicist at the Niels Bohr Institute who has studied gender bias in the Nobels. But \u201cwhat are the mechanisms that make it easier for men to enter that pool of superstar scientists that could even be nominated for a Nobel Prize?\u201d\n\nCertain fields, like biology, chemistry and social sciences are reaching gender parity in undergraduate and graduate degrees. But representation falls further up the academic ladder \u2014 a problem known as the leaky pipeline. Some women are pushed out of science altogether because of experiences of sexism. Those who persist are less often promoted to senior professorships, and even fewer become chief physicians, department heads, or journal editors.\n\nEven once in academia, women are not given tenure as often as men. They are not listed as the key author on as many papers, are cited less often than male colleagues, and receive fewer prestigious awards overall.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFiguring out whether the Nobels reflect even more bias than academia as a whole was \u201cnot easy\u201d Jauffred said. Researchers had to account for the lag between when a discovery is made and when it is recognized, and for the lower representation of women in science over the years. But even when accounting for those factors, she and her colleagues found in a 2019 study that the likelihood that bias against women played a role in the decision of who gets awards was around 96%.\n\nThis year\u2019s Nobel for physiology or medicine, which was awarded to Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros for the discovery of microRNA, has attracted particular scrutiny with regard to gender bias. Many outside observers commented on the fact that Rosalind Lee, Ambros\u2019 wife and long-time collaborator, was not recognized for the discovery despite being a first author on one of the studies cited by the committee. To some, the story seemed to write itself \u2014 another Rosalind overlooked by the committee, much like Rosalind Franklin, whose contributions to the discovery of DNA\u2019s double helix were not initially recognized.\n\nThere are, however, reasons beyond sexism that can lead collaborators like Lee to get overlooked. The Nobel committee limits awards to three people, which some scientists have pointed out is an antiquated way to reward discoveries that are increasingly part of large collaborations.\n\n\u201cAny project of any complexity rolls out over years with many contributors,\u201d said Bruce Wightman, a biologist at Muhlenberg College who was in Ruvkun\u2019s lab and worked on an aspect of the discovery of microRNA. \u201cScience takes a village.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for UMass Chan Medical School said Lee and Ambros are \u201ccelebrating the Nobel Prize and view it as a recognition of the team\u2019s collaborative work.\u201d\n\nThe push to reduce gender bias in Nobel Prizes\n\nThat said, how credit is distributed to scientists that are part of a large collaboration may also be the product of bias. One study found that women who co-authored papers were less likely to receive tenure compared to those who published papers alone. This kind of collaboration didn\u2019t have any effect on men\u2019s ability to get tenure. Another found that women tended to receive authorship on papers or patents to which they had contributed less often than male colleagues.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Nobels tend to \u201crecognize people who were in a position of power and authority, instead of the people who actually made a discovery or had an idea or proved it experimentally,\u201d said Pnina Abir-Am, a historian of science at Brandeis University, who has studied collaborative couples in science as well as documented the women who were not recognized for the Nobel prize for RNA splicing.\n\nNewsletter Weekdays Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Sign Up Your data will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. You may opt out of receiving STAT communications at any time.\n\nThe Nobel committee is often \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d in who it gives awards to, Abir-Am said, favoring those who are heads of the lab where the research was conducted as well as those who have trained with other Nobel laureates. That means lower chances of receiving the prize for women, racial minorities, and more junior scientists who have made breakthrough discoveries but are less likely to be in positions of power.\n\nNobel winners also tend to come from socioeconomically privileged backgrounds, according to Paul Novosad, an economist at Dartmouth College who studies access to opportunity and upward mobility. Novosad and his colleagues published a white paper this week finding that on average, laureates came from households with fathers in the 87th percentile of income in their country. Around half were in the top 5% by income.\n\nFemale laureates tended to be from even more elite families, which the authors write may be because the higher socioeconomic status helps them overcome some of the gendered obstacles in academia. But \u201cit means that elite women in the sciences are drawn from an even smaller socioeconomic pool than men, implying substantial misallocation,\u201d they write in the paper.\n\n\u201cIf children who are brilliant but poor fail to make it into the sciences, then all of humanity loses out on their potential discoveries,\u201d said Novosad.\n\nThings may be changing. The analysis found that the average socioeconomic status of laureates is creeping downward, which could signal a slow democratization of the sciences. \u201cThis kind of research is really important for the same reasons that we would like to see less elite demographics represented in various top positions,\u201d said Novosad. \u201cUnfortunately there is still a surprising amount of work to do just to convince men in senior scientific positions that these barriers exist at all.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne change that may make recognition more fair going forward is the growing practice of papers delineating what each author has contributed to a paper. \u201cJournals require scientists to say who contributed to conception and who contributed to experiments,\u201d Abir-Am said. This creates less ambiguity around who directly contributed to discoveries that are being honored by awards \u2014 as opposed to assuming lab heads or senior authors did the lion\u2019s share of the work. \u201cI don\u2019t care who is a director and who is a junior [researcher], I want to know who did what.\u201d\n\nThe organizations that select Nobel laureates have taken steps to address the laureates\u2019 lack of diversity in recent years. In 2019, Nobel committees began asking nominators to consider gender and ethnicity to encourage a wider range of diversity in nominees. And since scientists have to be invited to contribute nominations, \u201c[w]e are extending invitations to an increasing number of individuals from regions beyond traditional academic research hubs in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan,\u201d Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, told Nature this week. \u201cMoreover, we\u2019re actively identifying more women and younger scientists as nominators.\u201d\n\nJauffred has also seen improvement. She was motivated to write her paper on gender bias in the Nobels after Donna Strickland in 2018 became the first woman to win the Nobel in physics in 55 years. Since 2018, two more women have also won the Nobel in physics. Still, progress is slow.\n\n\u201cThe demography of fields has been changing for a long time, but it\u2019s not yet reflected in Nobel Prizes,\u201d Jauffred said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t see that diversity represented in the Nobel Prizes, of course we ask ourselves questions. Why does it have to be like that?\u201d\n\nMegan Molteni contributed reporting."

        "article_content": "How can Uranus teach us about exoplanets? This is what a recent study presented at the 56th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS) hopes to address as a team of researchers investigated how gas giants like Uranus can be used to better understand the characteristics of exoplanets. While exoplanets have been discovered using the direct imaging method, no exoplanet has been directly imaged itself. Therefore, this study holds the potential to use gas giant planets within our solar system as analogs for exoplanets throughout the cosmos.\n\nFor the study, the researchers analyzed data collected from NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft and the Hubble Space Telescope to study the atmosphere of Uranus in various wavelengths. Both telescopes exhibit different imaging properties, as Hubble is built to obtain up-close images from far away while New Horizons is built to obtain up-close images from close-up. As a result, the images from Hubble revealed far more detail while the images from New Horizons revealed Uranus as a small dot.\n\n\"Uranus appears as just a small dot on the New Horizons observations, similar to the dots seen of directly-imaged exoplanets from observatories like Webb or ground-based observatories,\" said Samantha Hasler, who is a PhD Candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and lead author of the study. \"Hubble provides context for what the atmosphere is doing when it was observed with New Horizons.\"\n\nTwo 3-D renditions with their respective images of Uranus obtained by Hubble and New Horizons. (Credit: NASA, ESA, STScI, Samantha Hasler (MIT), Amy Simon (NASA-GSFC), New Horizons Planetary Science Theme Team; Image Processing: Joseph DePasquale (STScI), Joseph Olmsted (STScI))\n\nIn the end, the combined data sets revealed that Uranus\u2019 cloud brightness and features were unchanged during the planet\u2019s rotation. Along with collecting data from two different vantage points, one goal of the study was to learn how astronomers could use future\u2014and more powerful\u2014telescopes to observe and study exoplanets throughout the universe. An example of this is NASA\u2019s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which is slated for launch by 2027, and NASA\u2019s Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), which is in the early planning stages and does not have a launch date yet. However, both telescopes are designed to expand our understanding of exoplanets, with HWO\u2019s goal being to analyze exoplanets for signatures of life, also called biosignatures.\n\n\u201cStudying how known benchmarks like Uranus appear in distant imaging can help us have more robust expectations when preparing for these future missions,\u201d said Hasler. \u201cAnd that will be critical to our success.\u201d\n\nWhat new comparisons between gas giants within our solar system and exoplanets will astronomers make in the coming years and decades? Only time will tell, and this is why we science!\n\nAs always, keep doing science & keep looking up!\n\nSources: 56th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS), EurekAlert!, NASA\n\nFeatured Image: Image of Uranus obtained by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope (left) and NASA's New Horizon's spacecraft (right).
