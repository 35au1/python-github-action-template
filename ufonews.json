            "article_content": "A UFO expert believes that aliens could invade Earth at any moment and warned that they \"will make themselves known\".\n\nCarl Nally, of UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), issued the chilling warning after unexplained flying objects were spotted near military facilities. The mystery sightings came in the US, UK and Germany. Mr Nally said sightings are on the rise and believes there could be a portal for aliens to enter and exit Earth.\n\nAccording to Mr Nally, the secret entrance is nestled in the middle of Ireland between Athlone and Slane. His claims come after US authorities said they were unable to establish the origin of the objects. \"We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus,\" a White House official said last week.\n\nImage: X/@charliekirk11) X/@charliekirk11)\n\nMr Nally claimed that if the flashing lights that were spotted were simply drones, it would have been confirmed by now. He told the Irish Mirror: \"It\u2019s an amazing situation, the way we see it. You would imagine that, when anything appears over a military base, a military helicopter would go up and investigate them but they haven\u2019t done that.\n\n\u201cThey call them drones. Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\u201d\n\nMr Nally said the appearance of flying objects near military bases is part of an unprecedented global surge in UFO sightings over the past two months \u2013 including in Ireland, where several suspected UFOs have been spotted around Slane and Athlone. He suggested there were certain locations on the planet where UFOs enter from space and leave again, and claimed one such location may exist in the Irish midlands \u2013 explaining the uptick in sightings in recent weeks.\n\nImage: littlespacemochi/ Reddit) littlespacemochi/ Reddit) Image: littlespacemochi / Reddit) littlespacemochi / Reddit)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very peculiar that it\u2019s happening in a lot of places at the same time,\u201d said Mr Nally. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to that on this side of the world. At some point, they will make themselves known, and why not now?\u201d\n\nThe UFO expert said the recent sightings suggested extra-terrestrials were assessing military strength, and noted that UFOs had also been spotted in the vicinity of nuclear facilities. \"It seems to be some kind of observation that\u2019s going on at this point in time, and it seems to have increased, without a shadow of a doubt, and you would wonder,\" he claimed.\n\nMr Nally was relaxed about the prospect of an alien invasion, however, and suggested there were greater threats to mankind to worry about. \"If you put that [an alien invasion] on one side of the scales and AI [artificial intelligence] on the other, I\u2019d be more concerned about AI,\" he said.\n\nMr Nally has co-authored three books on aliens and UFOs with Dermot Butler, the most recent of which was Circle of Deceit. They are currently working on their fourth book."

            "article_content": "If you\u2019re seeing and hearing drones or other such flying things flashing in the sky, it\u2019s absolutely certain that you are not imagining it and you are not alone. However, what remains troublingly uncertain is what is actually going on and it\u2019s a question that government has done a lousy job answering.\n\nThe future head of that government, Donald Trump, said yesterday: \u201cThe government knows what is happening. For some reason, they don\u2019t want to comment. And I think they\u2019d be better off saying what it is our military knows and our president knows.\u201d\n\nWe often disagree with Trump, but his call for transparency is sound.\n\nWhat do the sightings mean? Hopefully not a real life \u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d invasion copying Orson Welles\u2019 1938 fictional radio show Martian attack, also in New Jersey. The unsatisfying answer is we don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019ll venture that it\u2019s unlikely that this is some sort of sophisticated foreign intelligence operation that federal officials are somehow unaware of.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s some kind of undisclosed military program that Trump mentioned, or coordinated pranks or, as is may be the case with these things, a phenomenon that\u2019s taken a life of its own when there\u2019s no there there.\n\nA few experts and officials have already pointed out that at least some of the sightings seem to be commercial planes. One Jersey resident claimed to have shined a laser pointer at a \u201cdrone\u201d that seems to have really been a FedEx plane. Needless to say, do not do this; risking plane crashes is the opposite of helpful as we try to figure out what\u2019s going on.\n\nThis is all representative of a broader and more acute reality than whatever is going on with these particular sightings: we have more or less lost the ability to contend with and clarify things like this as a society. Conspiracy theories are nothing new, and neither is distrusting official sources of information. Some of our greatest advances as a society and moments of public accountability and reform have come from people going against and questioning narratives.\n\nInstead, we\u2019re faced with something like a choose-your-own-adventure for reality, where every amateur sleuth and social media voice gets a chance to run wild and potentially cause significant damage with their laser pointer exploits.\n\nThe culture of secrecy at the nation\u2019s law enforcement and military entities has left them tight-lipped in a way that the public just takes as confirmation that there\u2019s something nefarious going on, as Trump suggests, and the news media\u2019s cautious reporting, responsive to what we know to be true, is seen as evasive and dismissive.\n\nPeople want there to be clear-cut answers, now. The idea that this could be a series of misidentifications of commercial planes, faraway planets and hobbyists drones (or probably all of the above) even if that turns out to be the correct answer, may not be welcomed by a public that seems hungry for something else.\n\nSo, let\u2019s just go through each sighting, one by one, and determine its cause. The Martians patiently planned their attack in \u201cThe War of the Worlds;\u201d will Americans have the same level of patience?"

For example, the company recently gave Gemini the ability to summarize Drive folders to provide a quick overview. We\u2019ve also recently discovered that the company is working on an AI-powered \u201cCall To-do List\u201d function. In its latest initiative, it looks like we could start seeing AI search suggestions in the Google app on iOS.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else. An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\n\nWhile exploring the Google app on iOS, we noticed something interesting. Sitting neatly in the search box was a new pencil icon. Tapping on this icon opens up a new page with a text box and a few suggestions, as seen in the screenshots below.\n\nWhen you begin typing in this text box, you\u2019ll see the Gemini icon below along with text that reads \u201cGenerate AI suggestions.\u201d Once enough words are in the field, it automatically starts generating suggestions based on your query. You can then select these suggestions to narrow down your search, working like filters.\n\nYou can see an example in the video above where we asked for help buying a gift. The suggestions that were generated provided options for \u201cbudget,\u201d \u201cgift occasion,\u201d and \u201crelationship to recipient.\u201d So you could select \u201cfriend,\u201d \u201cunder $50,\u201d and \u201cbirthday\u201d to get search results for an affordable birthday gift for your friend.\n\nIt appears this feature is still in beta testing, however, as it doesn\u2019t work properly quite yet. In the video below, you can see the feature struggling to work.\n\nThis feature could possibly save users some time, as they would not have to type out these commonly used keywords to get the results they are looking for.

            "article_content": "Do you miss your therapist the second your session ends? Do you wish you could talk longer or reach out during the week to share your every thought and feeling? Then you might appreciate this interactive journaling app that uses a therapist-backed, AI-powered chat to keep the convo going.\n\nInstead of holding everything in until your next sesh, you can simply open the Rosebud app whenever you need to vent, work through anxiety, set goals, or process tough feelings. I\u2019ve been using it for the past two weeks and it never fails to help me feel a little more centered.\n\nWith hundreds of five-star reviews in the app store, Rosebud is quickly becoming a go-to for many people who want to supplement their in-person therapy \u2014 or for those who want to treat themselves to an easy, breezy, but entirely helpful journaling experience. As you type in entries and answer daily prompts, the app learns more about your thought patterns and goals, and then it responds to you with personalized Qs that help you calm down, recenter, or get to know yourself better.\n\nIt\u2019s so much easier than journaling with a notebook and pen, and I\u2019ve also found it to be extremely validating when I\u2019m going through it and need somewhere to vent ASAP. Here\u2019s what it was like to use the Rosebud journal and what to know about the app.\n\nFast Facts\n\nPrice: Free to download, Rosebud Premium for $4.99/month\n\nFree to download, Rosebud Premium for $4.99/month Best for: Journaling, working through problems, venting\n\nJournaling, working through problems, venting My rating: 4/5\n\n4/5 What I like: Easy to use app, helpful chat, feels nice to vent\n\nEasy to use app, helpful chat, feels nice to vent What I don't like: Limits what you can do with the free version\n\nWhat To Know About Rosebud\n\nRosebud\n\nRosebud is an AI-powered self-care app that uses a therapist-designed journal and habit tracker to help you dig deeper into your thoughts and feelings. It offers the option to type or voice journal to fill in your diary entries. As you chat, the app also learns more about you and your needs \u2014 similar to your most beloved counselor.\n\nAs you log journal entries, answer prompts, set goals, and reflect on your day, Rosebud gives you feedback and insight so you can learn more about your go-to beliefs and thought patterns \u2014 perfect for dissecting why you always fall into the same mental traps. It\u2019s useful for navigating anxiety and stress, grief, anger, overthinking, overwhelm, and depression, or for clarity on a big decision.\n\nThe app has five tabs across the bottom. The Today tab is where you reflect, set intentions, and check off daily goals as you complete them. The Explore tab offers guided journals, personalized prompts, and workbooks from real therapists, and the plus sign in the middle lets you quickly create a blank journal entry to write down whatever your heart desires.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Insights tab where you\u2019ll find AI-generated personal reports, your analyzed journal entries, and a graph with your moods and weekly \u201cwins,\u201d aka themes you unpacked or habits uncovered. And the History section lets you peek at past entries so you can appreciate how far you\u2019ve come. The app is free, but the premium version offers unlimited personalized prompts, prompt bookmarking, voice journaling, unlimited entry history, and more.\n\nTrying It Out\n\nRosebud\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of self-care or #WellnessTok, than you likely already know about the many benefits of journaling. Jotting your thoughts is a good way to reduce stress, increase gratitude, and work through your problems, especially when you\u2019re stressed, but I love that this app adds a dash of therapy into the mix, too.\n\nI found myself waxing poetic within five minutes of downloading Rosebud. I went straight to the morning reflection section where I quickly analyzed how I felt and what I hoped to get out of my day. It\u2019s been so easy to start a fresh journal entry whenever I\u2019m having a moment of stress and anxiety, too. The AI chat does a good job of breaking down what I\u2019m feeling and explaining it back to me.\n\nRosebud\n\nAnother nice perk is the \u201cToday\u2019s goals\u201d section where you can customize what you hope to do with your day. I\u2019ve added stretching, reading, and going for more walks \u2014 and it feels good to pop back into the app and check them off as I go.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to wind down with the Evening Reflection section too. The AI prompts you to answer questions like \u201cWhat was the highlight of your day?\u201d or \u201cWhat was stressful about your day?\u201d Similar to how a therapist would ask you check in with yourself, Rosebud encourages you to pause and reflect \u2014 and it\u2019s nice to see what I\u2019ve learned about myself in the weekly Insights reports that lay it all out.\n\nRosebud\n\nIt isn\u2019t always easy to figure out what to write, which is why I love the various journal prompts and workbook-style sections in the Explore tab. There are things like gratitude journals, dream journals, relationship check-ins, and journals made by therapists with themes like \u201cacceptance and commitment,\u201d \u201cnervous system rebalancing,\u201d and \u201cknowing your needs.\u201d\n\nAs an anxious girly, I immediately clicked on the nervous system rebalancing journal and was prompted to start off with four deep breaths. Once I was chill, the chat guided me through questions about what puts me on edge, how stress makes me feel, the triggers that set me off, and how I tend to relax and reset.\n\nRosebud\n\nIt was all very eye-opening. Turns out I need a slow, mellow morning routine or I\u2019ll be a total wreck for the rest of the day. I also can\u2019t skip daily walks \u2014 not even when it\u2019s rainy or cold \u2014 or else I kind of crumble. And it appears that I really value (and talk a lot about) accomplishing my to-do list. (Very Virgo rising of me.)\n\nAs I typed, the app offered the option to either finish my journal or \u201cgo deeper,\u201d which meant it kept asking questions and encouraging me to reflect on what I had just said. This is where I really started to notice that the AI was learning my patterns and encouraging me to think further \u2014 something I wouldn\u2019t have gotten out of a regular paper-and-pen journal.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nWhile there\u2019s no true replacement for meeting with a therapist, I like that the Rosebud AI was \u201ctrained\u201d by therapists, so it doesn\u2019t just feel like random, cold info from the internet. The chat on the app seems like a conversation you\u2019d have with a real person, which makes it feel warmer and more helpful. I\u2019d say this is a great tool for venting, noticing thought patterns, and setting goals \u2014 or if you just really miss chatting with your therapist between sessions."

            "article_content": "Nvidia has released a new $249 version of its Jetson computer meant for running artificial applications locally. The palm-sized Orin Nano is said to double the speed and efficiency of its predecessor at half the price, and it can process roughly 70% more computational tasks, according to Nvidia.\n\nThe Orin Nano is ideal for hobbyists looking to train their own artificial intelligence applications, or for developers of robots and other industrial tools to run sophisticated applications without connecting to the cloud.\n\nIn a brief video on YouTube announcing the product, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stands in his kitchen as he pulls a tray out of his oven to reveal the small, palm-sized computer. Huang goes on to say the computer can process almost \u201cseventy trillion\u201d operations per second and draws just 25 watts of power.\n\n\u201cA long time ago, we created a brand new type of processor, it was a robotics processor,\u201d Huang says. \u201cNobody understood what we were building at the time, and we imagined that someday these deep learning models would evolve and we would have robots for everything.\u201d The Jetson computers were intended to power robots, but today can also run large language models like Meta\u2019s Llama.\n\nSam Altman\u2019s startup World (formerly Worldcoin), which aims to authenticate human identity with iris scans, uses a Jetpack module inside its Orb scanning device. In a blog post back in October, World said, \u201cIn its newest iteration, the Orb is equipped with the most advanced NVIDIA Jetson module with nearly 5x the AI performance over the previous version to enable even faster, more seamless proof of human verifications.\u201d\n\nIn essence, the Orin Nano is a portable brain that can be plugged into other hardware to power its AI functionality. Cloud hyperscalers\u2014a term for companies building massive data centers for AI\u2014 like Amazon and Google charge for access to servers and AI models, and those costs can add up. Certain applications might need guaranteed uptime and minimal latency, such as warehouse robots. Connecting to a remote cloud hosting provider is not ideal. That being said, a computer like the Orin Nano will only be capable of running more lightweight AI applications\u2014it will not replace Nvidia\u2019s high-end GPUs that cost tens of thousands of dollars and are capable of training and inferring from large-scale AI models.\n\nStill, in a world where running AI is becoming increasingly cheap and accessible, startups are quickly going to learn the value of having real intellectual property. Shoving an AI model into a smart home camera is no longer going to be good enough when anyone can easily do it."

In fact, if you had asked me that question prior to September, I'd likely have said the same. As it stands, my favorite AI tool of 2024 is actually Google's NotebookLM.\n\nFor those unaware, NotebookLM is a free, web-based, AI-powered tool made by Google Labs to help with research and note-taking. Originally released in July 2023, Google's tool showed potential but lacked something to make it stand out in a growing pool of alternatives.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September, that certain something finally came about when a new update saw the Gemini 1.5 Pro-powered tool outfitted with an audio overview option. It's that feature, which generates impressive podcast-like segments between two virtual hosts, that has elevated this tool to my favorite of the year.\n\nNot only because of how impressive the end results are, but also because of how easily digestible, if not entertaining, the outcome is.\n\nThe problem: too much stuff, not enough time\n\nMy days are pretty packed, which means keeping up to speed with the ever-shifting landscapes of my work and personal interests can be quite demanding.\n\nLest I confine myself to reading a never-ending list of articles every waking hour of my day, I subscribe to the \"white noise\" approach of soaking in as much information as I can. That typically means listening to a lot of podcasts or media in the background while I'm busying myself with other tasks, jobs, or hobbies.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's not an entirely uncommon thing either. There's a reason that a lot of long-form videos on YouTube fall short on the visual medium front. They're designed to be soaked up in the background while we browse around in other tabs, read comments, play games, or craft a tesla coil out of otherwise innocent household scraps.\n\nThe problem is that when there's no podcast or long-form content covering the topics I want to hear more about, I have to sacrifice what time I have free to soak things up the old-fashioned way.\n\nThe solution: Google's NotebookLM\n\nNotebookLM is my solution in those moments, and it has been doing an outstanding job at the tail end of 2024 in keeping me up to speed with everything going on in my circle of interests.\n\nIts audio overview feature lets me compile all of the information I'm looking to great a breakdown of into a single media file, where I can rack it up as part of a playlist, or stream online while I'm busying myself with other things.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hosts of each NotebookLM overview are practically a stroke of genius, and they lend a hint of that easy-listening morning show slash all-too-happy-to-be-talking-about-true-crime vibe to the results.\n\nCreating audio overviews takes a few minutes at a time, but most of which is waiting on the audio generation, and it tends to be worth the wait with the virtual personalities tasked with delivering your chosen piece of content back to you often being engaging, entertaining, and occasionally even amusing.\n\nTo anyone, like myself, who loves to soak information in from a background source, it's the podcast of your dreams, with every episode tailored to your own interests and desire to learn more.\n\nGoogle NotebookLM Plus one sheet showing paid/membership features.\n\nOutlook\n\nAs impressive as NotebookLM is, Google is still finding ways to make it even better.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly last week, Google announced a new wave of updates to NotebookLM that looks to improve the user interface, a new premium tier of service with more control over the generated audio (included within your Google One AI Premium membership), and the option to further interact with the virtual hosts of your AI-generated overviews by \"joining\" the conversation using your voice to direct the duo in expanding on topics to give more details, take alternate approaches to explaining something, or answer any questions you may have about the topic.\n\nAdmittedly, you could get an app like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, etc. to pull off a similar feat, but you don't have the unique dual-host angle on things, nor do you have the same level of interaction, customization, or audio extraction as NotebookLM offers.\n\nSo, if you're anything like me, and I mean that solely in your preferred manner of learning new things or catching up with recent news or events, give NotebookLM a try.\n\nYou can even make use of the tool to generate podcasts of your own, letting the virtual hosts take center stage to share a topic you've done the research and preparation on beforehand.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhat Google Labs has developed is both impressive and incredibly useful, and while something like ChatGPT is a far more capable and direct way to use AI, NotebookLM stands as one of my favorite ways to learn using AI."

Or are you living under \u2026 a drone? Or several of them? Some Maricopa residents believe so.\n\nIt\u2019s a bird! It\u2019s a drone! It\u2019s a cop? Seriously, what are these things?\n\nThe FBI, Department of Homeland Security, state police and other agencies have launched investigations into the recent torrent of inexplicable drone sightings.\n\nJohn Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, said Monday that there has yet to be any public safety or national security risk identified in any of the drone sightings. He said that officials believe they were lawfully flown drones, planes or stars.\n\nBut that seemingly did little to abate UFO anxiety here on the opposite side of the country, where three reported sightings in Maricopa and Hidden Valley have been posted to the social networking site Nextdoor in as many days.\n\nRancho El Dorado resident Marcus Griffin posted Sunday about his own drone sighting.\n\n\u201cI will add to the HYPE: Has anyone ever paid attention to the DRONE activity around Maricopa at night?\u201d Griffin questioned. \u201cI live in the back of [Rancho El Dorado] adjacent to the farmer fields and I see large drones operating on a regular.\u201d\n\nThe same day, Nextdoor user Nevaeh P., who lives on the east side, posted a photo and video of \u201corbs\u201d she saw while on her way to Phoenix.\n\n\u201cI have seen lots of weird stuff in the sky but over the past few years it seems there\u2019s been more and more paranormal activity to the point where it\u2019s not ignorable anymore,\u201d Nevaeh said. \u201cA few hours [after] I recorded this, I went on TikTok, and my feed was overflowing with videos similar to mine. Of course, our phones listen to us, so maybe it was just feeding into my delusions but it\u2019s weird how everyone else in the world is seeing or experiencing the same things!\u201d\n\nThe most recent post came yesterday from a Hidden Valley user who said she had for weeks been hearing about a Standfield drone group flying for several hours at night with detailed sightings.\n\nThe user attached a screenshot sourced from the r/AskLEO (law enforcement officer) subreddit that she said might \u2018explain\u2019 the sightings.\n\n\u201cPinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Eloy Police Department have added drones to patrol and run surveillance for certain investigations,\u201d said the Reddit user u/Nervous_Comb_8047.\n\nInMaricopa contacted the Pinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office to see if this was accurate.\n\nPCSO spokeswoman Lauren Reimer said the sheriff\u2019s office uses drones for these specific purposes (neither surveillance nor patrol is one of them):\n\nScene documentation to record evidence from a crime scene or traffic accident from above.\n\nDuring active SWAT incidents to monitor suspect activity around and inside a home or building where a suspect is barricaded, as well as to clear the building before, during and/or after a high-risk arrest.\n\nAerial searches to follow or search for a wanted suspect when the perimeter is known, and air support (helicopter) may be far away or unavailable.\n\nSearch and rescue operations when searching for missing or injured hikers, etc.\n\n\u201cPCSO does not use drones for daily patrol operations,\u201d Reimer confirmed.\n\nSo, the next time you see a post about another drone or \u201corb\u201d sighting, or you see one yourself, keep in mind it might just be PCSO trying to keep people safe. Or, hey, it could be aliens."

Visitors to this 19th-century Gothic mansion in Neath Port Talbot have long shared eerie tales of spectral figures, unexplained laughter, and objects that seem to move of their own accord.\n\nFrom the vengeful ghost of a murdered gamekeeper to the echoes of Victorian children\u2019s laughter, Margam Castle has earned its reputation as one of the most haunted places in Britain.\n\nREAD MORE: A fish and chip shop is opening up to feed the vulnerable for free over Christmas\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: Mystery of haunted lighthouse off the Welsh coastline\n\nBut the castle\u2019s haunting is just one layer of its story. As Dave explains, \u201cWe\u2019re on a historic site here at Margam, one that has been permanently occupied for at least 4,000 years.\u201d\n\nFrom the Bronze Age through to Roman times, and later the founding of the Cistercian Abbey in the 12th century, this site has seen centuries of human life\u2014and, perhaps, lingering spirits.\n\nMargam Castle is part of Margam Country Park, a gorgeous 1,000-acre South Wales estate in the Neath Port Talbot region, also known as the 'Dramatic heart of Wales'.\n\nThe castle, built between 1830 and 1840 by architect Thomas Hopper for Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot, is a striking example of Tudor-Gothic architecture. \u201cIf you look up at the ceiling,\u201d Dave points out on tours, \u201cyou\u2019ll see the initials CRMT\u2014Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot\u2014very proud of his ancestry and heritage.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Talbot family owned the estate until 1942 when the castle fell into disrepair following a devastating fire in 1977.\n\nThe council owns the property today, and ongoing restoration work ensures its grandeur is preserved.\n\nDespite the fire\u2019s destruction, many original features remain, from the intricate stone carvings to the elegant stained glass windows, which, as Dave explains, \u201cdate back to when the house was built, almost 200 years ago.\u201d\n\nWhile the castle impresses with its architecture and history, its eerie ghost stories draw in thrill-seekers and paranormal enthusiasts.\n\nThe ghost of Robert Scott\n\nMargam Castle is part of Margam Country Park -Credit:Robert Melen\n\nThe most infamous spirit of Margam Castle is Robert Scott, a gamekeeper who was murdered on the estate\u2014some say by a poacher, others by an escaped convict. His presence is said to rage through the castle and the estate to this day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nScott is frequently spotted making a determined ascent up the Gothic staircase that leads to the Castle. His presence is a recurring theme among psychic investigators, who all agree that his spirit seethes with fury, unable to rest after his untimely and unjust death.\n\nAfter nightfall, the castle\u2019s security guards report the unsettling sounds of hurried footsteps and low, chattering voices echoing through the empty halls\u2014though no trace of another soul is ever found.\n\nPsychic investigators have described his presence as one of anger, with inexplicable slamming doors and objects being hurled across rooms attributed to his spirit. Visitors who\u2019ve dared to investigate report an overwhelming sense of dread, as though Scott\u2019s rage still lingers.\n\nChildren\u2019s giggles and mischievous spirits\n\nAnother frequently reported occurrence is the sound of children\u2019s laughter echoing through the castle\u2019s long, empty corridors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVisitors claim to have seen ghostly figures of children in Victorian clothing flitting in and out of rooms, as though playing an eternal game of hide-and-seek. Others describe objects mysteriously moving or disappearing, believed to be the playful antics of these mischievous spirits.\n\nA shadowy blacksmith\n\nThe ghost of a blacksmith is another familiar figure at Margam, often spotted by the groundskeepers and gardeners who maintain the estate.\n\nAt night, security guards on patrol have reported unsettling sounds: hurried footsteps, murmuring voices, and shadows darting across the walls\u2014despite the castle being empty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reputedly one of the most haunted places in the United Kingdom,\u201d Dave confirms. While he hasn\u2019t experienced anything personally, the sheer volume of stories visitors and staff share suggests otherwise.\n\nParanormal Activity at Margam Castle\n\nThe most infamous spirit of Margam Castle is Robert Scott -Credit:Getty Images\n\nMargam Castle\u2019s ghostly reputation has attracted paranormal investigators from across the globe. Reports of cold spots, mysterious orbs of light, and sudden temperature drops are commonplace during overnight ghost vigils. Objects have been known to move independently, while unexplained noises chill even the bravest ghost hunters.\n\nThe spirit of Robert Scott remains the most active, with psychic investigators describing his presence as hostile and overwhelming. Rocks have been thrown during s\u00e9ances, and the sensation of being watched is unnervingly frequent in certain castle areas. For those who dare, Margam offers an experience unlike any other.\n\nGhost Zunters International at Margam Castle\n\nMargam's haunted history made waves across the Atlantic when Ghost Hunters International filmed an episode here for the SyFy Channel.\n\nThe investigation, broadcast to over a million viewers, shone a global spotlight on the site\u2019s paranormal activity, cementing its status as one of Britain\u2019s spookiest destinations.\n\nParanormal investigators used low lux cameras, full spectrum photography and super sensitive recording devices to capture \u201celectronic voice phenomena\u201d which is said to be spirit world voices.\n\nThe enthusiastic American team claimed to have captured on camera the floating figure of a monk wearing a white habit.\n\nAnd they also claimed to have \u201cspoken\u201d with a medieval monk called Brother Tom, seen a \u201cghost\u201d in shadow form of Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot \u2013 the man who commissioned the building of the castle \u2013 and heard the footsteps of Lady Emily Charlotte in the bedroom in which she died almost 100 years ago.\n\nMargam Castle\u2019s ghostly reputation has attracted paranormal investigators from across the globe -Credit:Lydia Royce\n\nAttend a ghost hunt\n\nFor those eager to experience the castle\u2019s ghostly atmosphere, Haunting Happenings offers overnight ghost hunts at Margam Castle\u2014a daunting but thrilling prospect.\n\nThese spooky events provide a unique opportunity to search for the spirits that roam the castle\u2019s many haunted rooms. Guests can expect strange light anomalies, loud footsteps echoing on the grand staircase, and sudden, extreme drops in temperature. Few are brave enough to spend time alone in the most active areas of the castle.\n\nThis popular overnight experience includes access to ghost hunting equipment such as EMF Meters and K2 Meters and interactive experiments like glass divination, table tipping, and Ouija boards.\n\nThe event features small group s\u00e9ances, ghost hunting vigils, and even free time to explore the castle\u2019s shadows alone. Teas and coffees are provided to keep spirits\u2014of the living variety\u2014high during the night.\n\nWhy visit Margam Castle?\n\nMargam Castle\u2019s ghostly reputation has attracted paranormal investigators from across the globe -Credit:South Wales Evening Post\n\nWhile the ghost stories are reason enough for many visitors, Margam Castle is also a gorgeous architectural gem surrounded by natural beauty. Dave Phillips says, \u201cThere\u2019s a story to be told here, from the stationing of American soldiers during World War II to visits from historical figures like Admiral Lord Nelson and General Dwight Eisenhower.\u201d\n\nMargam Country Park offers more than ghostly tales. From scenic walks and historic ruins to mountain biking trails and paddleboarding, there are plenty of activities for the whole family.\n\nFor those brave enough, ghost tours and overnight vigils provide the perfect opportunity to experience Margam\u2019s supernatural side firsthand.\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re drawn by its history, beauty, or the chilling possibility of encountering one of its many spirits, Margam Castle is well worth a stop. But as the shadows lengthen and the night falls, keep your ears open\u2026 you might hear laughter where no one stands or footsteps where no one walks.\n\nNeed to know"

            "article_content": "We blotted out the stars and became frightened when we saw our own lights amidst the darkness. America is in the midst of a full-on drone panic and it\u2019s gotten very stupid. People in the northeast part of the U.S. are freaking out about strange lights in the sky and spinning all kinds of conspiracy theories. The dark truth is that American memories are short and we\u2019ve panicked about lights in the skies\u2014be they drones, UFOs, or German bombers\u2014many many times before.\n\nOver the past few weeks, people in New Jersey and NYC have pointed to the sky and quaked in fear at the strange lights above them they had never noticed before. The FBI has held briefings about the issue. New York State closed some runways at Stewart International Airport in Poughkeepsie. The White House is asking Congress to do something.\n\nWe have been here before. Recently. And what\u2019s frustrating, to me, about this is that we\u2019ll do it all again in a few years. And when it happens, we don\u2019t remember all the sky panics that have come before.\n\nIt\u2019s natural to be afraid of things we see in the sky and don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s been happening for hundreds of years. The only thing that changes, from century to century, is the explanation for the fear. The answer to that question tells you about the society that\u2019s afraid, but it may not give you an explanation of what actually happened.\n\n\u201cThe airspace above us is big, mysterious, and spooky. It\u2019s totally natural that people project wild visions of secret, unknowable aircraft onto the night sky,\u201d Arthur Holland Michel, a journalist who covers drones and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs, told Gizmodo\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think we should dismiss right out of hand every potential drone sighting,\u201d he added. \u201cWe know for a fact that drones can sometimes be used to do harm, and we probably shouldn\u2019t lose sight of that fact just because a bunch of people see drones in the sky that do not, in fact, exist.\u201d\n\nOver the past 25 years, there\u2019s been a lot of panic about strange lights in the sky that mirror what\u2019s happening in New Jersey right now. In the last month of 2019 and the first month of 2020, people in Colorado were convinced they\u2019d seen unexplained lights in the sky. Like in 2024, the national press covered it and local politicians quavered. Washington promised to do something. The cases that could be verified and chased down had mundane answers. They were planes, commercial drones, and other common objects.\n\nIn 2016, a passenger plane was landing at Heathrow International Airport when it collided with what it thought was a drone. Had it actually happened, it would have been the first time a commercial airplane had struck a drone mid-flight. A report later found it was probably a plastic bag.\n\nOne of the first great panics about lights in the sky happened in Canada, not the U.S. In 1915, after Canada had entered World War I, the city of Ottawa became convinced it would soon be attacked from the sky.\n\nThe mayor of the town of Brockville, Ontario called the Prime Minister on February 14, 1915, with an incredible story. The mayor said that three German airplanes had penetrated Canadian airspace from New York. Dozens of citizens had seen them. The planes shined a light across the town and they dropped fireballs.\n\nFreaked out, the Prime Minister placed some calls of his own. Fearing an attack, much of Ottawa went dark. \u201cOttawa In Darkness Awaits Aeroplane Raid. Several Aeroplanes Make A Raid Into The Dominion Of Canada,\u201d read a newspaper from the time. No attack came and later some kids admitted to sending up balloons loaded with fireworks in a village near Brockville. They wanted to scare people. They didn\u2019t realize it would shut down their nation\u2019s capital for a few hours.\n\nSimilar scares happened across the eastern seaboard in the U.S. over the next few years. As World War I ground on, the nation was convinced that German spies were piloting strange planes in the sky. In 1916, the sightings were centered around Delaware, New Jersey, and Washington D.C. In 1917, a week after the U.S. entered World War I, two National Guardsmen in New Hampshire fired on a strange light they saw in the sky.\n\nDuring World War II, America trained its citizens to be paranoid about what it saw in the sky. Driven by a fear of attacks on the mainland, and a need to make citizens feel like they were part of the war effort, the U.S. Civil Defense Forces launched the Ground Observer Corps. Americans trained on what Axis aircraft looked like and then sat in 14,000 coastal locations and scanned the skies with binoculars.\n\nAfter the war ended people didn\u2019t hang up their binoculars. The U.S. had trained more than a million of its citizens to watch the skies. And so they did. In 1947, a military balloon crashed in Roswell, New Mexico, and it kicked off the first great sky-watching panic of the post-war years. UFOs were already in the news before the crash, but Roswell supercharged the phenomenon.\n\n\u201cThe Roswell crash was discovered weeks before the rancher who discovered it reported it. For weeks it was just weird wreckage and trash in the high desert,\u201d Kelsey Atherton, an editor at the Center for International Policy, told me. \u201cAnd then, after reading the news of flying saucer sightings, the rancher who discovered it reported it to the sheriff, which retroactively made it the most famous UFO site. But without the panic, it\u2019s just a rancher who saw some junk.\u201d\n\nThe Cold War years were awash in fears about strange objects in the sky. It permeated our media, birthed subcultures, cults, and repeated panics. Some feared it was advanced Soviet weapons systems but, today, we remember it mostly as aliens. The Cold War UFO panic reached its apotheosis in the Clinton years with the airing of X-Files, a paranormal procedural whose mythology focused heavily on UFO myths.\n\nAs a new century dawned, the old fears of lights in the sky faded a bit. But they come back with a vengeance. As part of the Global War on Terror, America was using unmanned aerial vehicles to assassinate its enemies. On the homefront, affordable quadcopter drones hit the market and small objects took to the skies in droves.\n\nThe shape of what we feared was in the sky changed. No longer Soviet super weapons or UFOs, people began to see consumer drones flying through the sky. And they feared them. Journalist and drone expert Faine Greenwood predicted this in 2019, months ahead of the panic in Colorado.\n\n\u201cAn essential part of being human is our drive to ascribe meaning to things that we cannot adequately explain, and all of us do it, including the most brilliant and believable among us. The best we can do is to mitigate this natural tendency, because while it is understandable, it can be counterproductive,\u201d Greenwood wrote in Salon back then. \u201cIf we jump too quickly to the assumption that something weird in the sky is a drone, we might miss out on other explanations, like errant weather balloons, plastic bags, or, sure, alien spacecraft. An overemphasis on one kind of threat or problem can lead us to miss other problems.\u201d\n\nGreenwood\u2019s Salon piece contains other sky panics from the era, including sightings at Gatwick airport during the holiday season, more sightings at Heathrow, and the brief shuttering of an airport in Australia after staff mistook a balloon for a drone.\n\nI reached out to Greenwood to see what their favorite little-known drone panic is and they went farther back than 100 years. Greenwood says they\u2019re \u201cvery interested in the U.K. 1909 and 1913 mystery airship panics. I also like the 1561 celestial phenomena over Nuremberg,\u201d and pointed me to Roman writings about strange things in the sky.\n\nHumans, it seems, have long been fascinated and frightened by strange things in the sky. As Michel cautioned, it\u2019s important to remember that the panics of the past and present don\u2019t mean something isn\u2019t going on. As Greenwood cautioned in 2019, it\u2019s important to focus on what\u2019s actually happening around us.\n\nDrones and cameras are ubiquitous. They\u2019re both weapons of war. The dominant visual of the war in Ukraine is that of an FPV drone. The viewer sits aboard the machine as it hunts down a soldier in a trench. It finds them. The soldier panics and fires at the sky. But it\u2019s no use. The drone descends, the camera cuts out, and we know the soldier is dead.\n\nAuthorities across the planet are putting cameras on flying machines and using them to spy on citizens, customers, and enemies. We read about it daily. We know it\u2019s happening. Is it any wonder, then, that we look up in the sky and fear what might be watching or waiting in the wings to deliver death for some unseen and unknowable purpose?"

(Representational image)\n\nA drone pilot from New Jersey has described his encounter with a mysterious object near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military facility where unexplained drone sightings have been increasing.\n\nMichael B, a paranormal investigator and podcaster behind the YouTube channel \u2018Terror Talk Productions\u2019, was trying to examine a suspicious flying object when his drone malfunctioned unexpectedly.\n\nrelated stories\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Michael B said that he was flying his drone near the restricted airspace of Picatinny Arsenal when he noticed a mysterious device hovering nearby. \u201cThere was a drone just hanging out\u2026 I had full battery life. Not 3 minutes into the flight, I lost control of the drone,\" he said.\n\nShortly after, a warning flashed on his screen, and his drone suddenly started descending due to a dead battery. However, the unknown object he was investigating remained in the air, sparking more questions about its origin.\n\nAlthough drones are typically grounded or forced to land when they enter restricted airspace, the mysterious object\u2019s ability to stay airborne while Michael B\u2019s drone malfunctioned is raising concerns.\n\nThe rise in reported drone sightings near Picatinny Arsenal has led to an official investigation, with authorities looking into the possible causes.\n\nAn army spokesperson confirmed that a temporary flight restriction had been imposed over Picatinny Arsenal, effective till December 26, following the recent increase in drone activity.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is also investigating the incidents and has introduced additional flight restrictions around the area, including over the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster.\n\nThe series of unexplained drone sightings has sparked public concern, with New Jersey State Senator Joe Pennacchio calling for a federal investigation. He even sent a letter to President-elect Donald Trump, urging action over the lack of answers regarding the mysterious drones.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nWhile the origins of the drones in New Jersey remain unclear, John Kirby, the White House national security communications adviser, stated that many of the reported sightings may be of manned aircraft operating legally.\n\nDespite this, former CIA operations officer Laura Ballman speculated that the unidentified drones could be part of a secretive technology test aimed at avoiding detection or being detected.\n\nLocation : United States of America (USA)\n\nFirst Published: December 17, 2024, 16:31 IST"

Bones with slicing cuts, as if someone had butchered the skin around them.\n\nFor more than 50 years, the remains found in a shaft at the Charterhouse Warren Farm in southwest England have been a blip in British archaeological history. Discovered by cave explorers in 1970, the collection of mismatched bones seemed to be just another Bronze Age gravesite \u2014 a few victims scattered among sediment and animal skeletons.\n\nNow, a recent study published in the Cambridge University journal Antiquity suggests a stunningly grim saga played out at Charterhouse Warren, at far greater scale than previously thought: The bones belong to at least 37 men, women and children who were slaughtered and possibly eaten in a ceremonial feast after their massacre.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken us all aback. It was completely unexpected, totally atypical for the period and for almost all of British prehistory,\u201d said Rick Schulting, a professor of archaeology at Oxford University who led the study."

Since the 1800s, only 6 samples have ever been documented worldwide, and all but one of these was from New Zealand. From a scientific and conservation point of view, this is huge.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Grizzly details about ancient child sacrifices, a map of a lost city in the Amazon and the answer to a Stonehenge mystery are some of this year\u2019s insights into human history.\n\nBygone brains\n\nDiscovering a human brain at an archaeological site is more common than you might think. A new archive catalogs some 4,400 ancient brains that have been found dried out, frozen or otherwise preserved (SN: 3/19/24). Brains may owe such surprising sturdiness to their chemical makeup.\n\nThis 1,000-year-old naturally preserved human brain of an individual excavated from a Belgian churchyard is still soft and wet and stained orange with iron oxides. Alexandra L. Morton-Hayward\n\nAncient arts and crafts\n\nThe oldest rock art in the Americas may be a set of cave paintings in Argentina that date back some 8,200 years (SN: 3/9/24, p. 16). That\u2019s several thousand years older than other rock art in the region. The nearly 900 paintings in a cave called Cueva Huenul 1 \u2014 which include geometric shapes plus figures of humans and animals \u2014 may have helped preserve cultural knowledge across generations of hunter-gatherers.\n\nHunter-gatherers in northwestern Patagonia, Argentina painted nearly 900 designs (some shown) in a cave over 130 generations, probably to transmit cultural knowledge, researchers say. Guadalupe Romero Villanueva\n\nHerder heritage\n\nYamnaya herders arriving from southwest Asia rewrote Europe\u2019s genetic history starting around 5,000 years ago, according to the DNA of more than 1,600 ancient people (SN: 2/10/24, p. 14). Northern Europeans may have Yamnaya ancestry to thank for their taller statures and lighter skin, as well as their vulnerability to multiple sclerosis. Eastern Europeans, meanwhile, may have inherited a Yamnaya gene variant linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThis Danish bog skull found with an arrow that had been shot through the nose dates to about 4,600 years ago, around the time when incoming herding groups from Asia transformed the genetic profiles of Danes and other people throughout Europe. The Danish National Museum\n\nEgyptian ergonomics\n\nHunching over scrolls took a toll on ancient Egyptian scribes (SN: 6/27/24). The skeletons of 30 scribes buried at the Abusir pyramid complex show signs of arthritis and other damage from poor posture.\n\nThe high dignitary Nefer (depicted with his wife in statues) was a scribe in ancient Abusir, Egypt. His skeleton and those of other scribes show signs of occupational wear and tear. Martin Frouz, Czech Institute of Egyptology/Charles University\n\nStonehenge\u2019s Scottish centerpiece\n\nThe mysterious Altar Stone at the heart of Stonehenge likely came from Scotland (SN: 8/14/24). Previously thought to share the Welsh origins of other Stonehenge blocks, the stone closely matches the mineral makeup of the Orcadian Basin, a Scottish rock formation.\n\nThe age and chemical makeup of two Altar Stone fragments (green) closely match a Scottish rock formation known as the Orcadian Basin. That\u2019s surprising because many other stones (blue) around the Altar Stone have Welsh roots. A.J.I. Clarke et al/Nature 2024\n\nPompeii\u2019s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day\n\nPompeii\u2019s infamous apocalypse was worse than thought. When Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79, it didn\u2019t just coat nearby cities with lethally hot gas, ash and rock \u2014 it also triggered deadly earthquakes, a study of collapsed buildings and crushed skeletons found (SN: 8/7/24).\n\nThis skeleton\u2019s fractures suggest that the person was crushed by the house he sheltered in when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79. The explosion likely caused quakes that toppled the house. Pompeii Archaeological Park\n\nMaya sacrifices unmasked\n\nChild sacrifices in a Maya burial chamber on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula were all young boys, DNA shows, upending a theory that women were sacrificed there in fertility rituals (SN: 6/12/24). The boys, sacrificed between A.D. 500 and 900, may have been killed to appease a rain god.\n\nTwin brothers and other related young boys were ritually sacrificed in Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 (a temple at the ancient Maya site, shown). Johannes Krause\n\nA lost city no more\n\nLaser scans unveiled the earliest and largest known urban complex in the Amazon (SN: 1/11/24). Beneath the trees in Ecuador\u2019s Upano Valley lie thousands of mounds that were once homes and community spaces, along with remnants of roads and farms. Inhabited from roughly 500 B.C. to A.D. 1500, the city shows how sophisticated Amazonian civilizations were long before European conquest.\n\nLaser scans at several ancient sites (one shown) in the Upano Valley in Ecuador revealed the remains of buildings arranged around plazas and distributed along wide streets. A. Dorison and S. Rostain\n\nX marks the spot\n\nIn a rare case of productive social media scrolling, a researcher identified part of a lost civilization\u2019s alphabet in a photo of an engraved slate posted to X (SN: 6/24/24). Found in Spain, the slate is from the Tartessos civilization, which vanished in the fifth century B.C. The writing system is linked to the Phoenician alphabet that shaped Latin, Spanish and English writing.\n\nAn analysis of an ancient slate slab revealed engraved letters (outlined in green), hinting that artisans from Spain\u2019s Tartessos culture inscribed an alphabet on the slate. Researchers plan to examine other slate fragments in hopes of finding missing letters. JFiJ/CSIC\n\nAgriculture was not inevitable\n\nA group of Stone Age hunter-gatherers known as the Iberomaurusians ate a mostly vegetarian diet of wild plants for millennia. And they did that without ever growing those plants as crops, according to an analysis of roughly 15,000-year-old human bones and teeth from a cave in Morocco (SN: 6/1/24, p. 14). These findings challenge the traditional idea that plant-based diets ultimately lead humans to grow their own food.\n\nAn analysis of human remains unearthed from this Moroccan cave suggest that some late Stone Age hunter-gatherers had a largely plant-based diet. But they never domesticated the plants, researchers say. Abdeljalil Bouzouggar\n\nPopulation boom idea is a bust\n\nContrary to popular belief, early Polynesian settlers of Rapa Nui, aka Easter Island, might not have undergone a population boom that destroyed their civilization and the island\u2019s environment. Ground surveys and satellite data hint that Polynesian islanders who arrived some 800 years ago set up a modest farming system and maintained a steady population of less than 4,000 until Europeans arrived 300 years ago (SN: 8/10/24, p. 14)."

Developers can now utilize the model on their highest usage tier; it's currently used by developers to build automated customer service systems, help inform supply chain decisions, and even forecast financial trends.\n\nSEE ALSO: OpenAI makes ChatGPT Search available to everyone starting now\n\nThe new o1 model can also connect to external data and APIs (aka Application Programming Interfaces, which is how different software applications communicate with each other). Developers can also use o1 to fine-tune messaging to give their AI applications a specific tone and style; the model also has vision capabilities so it can use images to \"unlock many more applications in science, manufacturing, or coding, where visual inputs matter.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

The company's new WebRTC Support will help in real-time voice services, utilizing JavaScript to ostensibly create better audio quality and more helpful responses (e.g., the RealTime API can start formulating responses to a query even while a user is still speaking). OpenAI also announced price reductions for services like WebRTC Support.\n\nAlso of note, OpenAI is now offering Preference Fine-Tuning to developers, which customizes the technology to respond better to \"subjective tasks where tone, style, and creativity matter\" than so-called Supervised Fine-Tuning.

The upgrade is one of a number of new features being rolled out to OpenAI's developer customers starting today.\n\nOpenAI announced during a livestream today that the new o1 model would bring back many of the \"core features you've been missing\" from the API during o1-preview. This includes the ability to use developer messages to help guide your particular chatbot (i.e. \"You are a helpful assistant for tax professionals.\") and access to a \"reasoning effort\" parameter that tells the API how long to think about specific queries, saving time and money on simple problems so they can be used on the tougher ones. API users can also use visual information like scans of documents as input.\n\nOpenAI also highlighted improvements to the new API's use of internal function calling, where the OpenAI model decides to call functions pre-written by outside developers to generate answers to certain queries, when appropriate. The new API is also more accurate in its use of structured outputs, which use a JSON schema to present information in a specific format outlined by the developer, OpenAI said.\n\nThe o1 model uses 60 percent fewer thinking tokens than o1-preview, OpenAI said, generating faster and cheaper results. But those results are also roughly 25 to 35 percentage points more accurate on benchmarks like LiveBench and the AIME, according to OpenAI.\n\nWhile o1 access will start rolling out to tier 5 development customers today, API access to the $200/month o1 Pro model is only promised to be \"coming soon.\""

            "article_content": "OpenAI is bringing o1, its \u201creasoning\u201d AI model, to its API \u2014 but only for certain developers, to start.\n\nStarting Tuesday, o1 will begin rolling out to devs in OpenAI\u2019s \u201ctier 5\u201d usage category, the company said. To qualify for tier 5, developers have to spend at least $1,000 with OpenAI and have an account that\u2019s older than 30 days since their first successful payment.\n\nO1 replaces the o1-preview model that was already available in the API.\n\nUnlike most AI, reasoning models like o1 effectively fact-check themselves, which helps them avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. As a drawback, they often take longer to arrive at solutions.\n\nThey\u2019re also quite pricey \u2014 in part because they require a lot of computing resources to run. OpenAI charges $15 for every ~750,000 words o1 analyzes and $60 for every ~750,000 words the model generates. That\u2019s 6x the cost of OpenAI\u2019s latest \u201cnon-reasoning\u201d model, GPT-4o.\n\nO1 in the OpenAI API is far more customizable than o1-preview, thanks to new features like function calling (which allows the model to be connected to external data), developer messages (which lets devs instruct the model on tone and style), and image analysis. In addition to structured outputs, o1 also has an API parameter, \u201creasoning_effort,\u201d that enables control over how long the model \u201cthinks\u201d before responding to a query.\n\nOpenAI said that the version of o1 in the API \u2014 and, soon, the company\u2019s AI chatbot platform, ChatGPT \u2014 is a \u201cnew post-trained\u201d version of o1. Compared to the o1 model released in ChatGPT two weeks ago, this one, \u201co1-2024-12-17,\u201d improves on \u201careas of model behavior based on feedback,\u201d OpenAI vaguely said.\n\n\u201cWe are rolling out access incrementally while working to expand access to additional usage tiers and ramping up rate limits,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post.\n\nIn a note on its website, OpenAI said that the newest o1 should provide \u201cmore comprehensive and accurate responses,\u201d particularly for questions pertaining to programming and business, and is less likely to incorrectly refuse requests.\n\nIn other dev-related news Tuesday, OpenAI announced new versions of its GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models as part of the Realtime API, OpenAI\u2019s API for building apps with low-latency, AI-generated voice responses. The new models (\u201cgpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17\u201d and \u201cgpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview-2024-12-17\u201d), which boast improved data efficiency and reliability, are also cheaper to use, OpenAI said.\n\nSpeaking of the Realtime API (no pun intended), it remains in beta, but it\u2019s gained several new capabilities, like concurrent out-of-band responses, which enables background tasks such as content moderation to run without interrupting interactions. The API also now supports WebRTC, the open standard for building real-time voice applications for browser-based clients, smartphones, and Internet of Things devices.\n\nIn what\u2019s certainly no coincidence, OpenAI hired the creator of WebRTC, Justin Uberti, in early December.\n\n\u201cOur WebRTC integration is designed to enable smooth and responsive interactions in real-world conditions, even with variable network quality,\u201d OpenAI wrote in the blog. \u201cIt handles audio encoding, streaming, noise suppression, and congestion control.\u201d\n\nIn the last of its updates Tuesday, OpenAI brought preference fine-tuning to its fine-tuning API; preference fine-tuning compares pairs of a model\u2019s responses to \u201cteach\u201d a model to distinguish between preferred and \u201cnonpreferred\u201d answers to questions. And the company launched an \u201cearly access\u201d beta for official software developer kits in Go and Java."

            "article_content": "NEW YORK, Dec. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iStock, a leading e-commerce platform providing premium content to SMBs, SMEs, creatives, and students everywhere, has released its 2025 Marketing Trends Report, packed with practical strategies to help businesses thrive in today\u2019s trust-driven marketplace.\n\nThe report comes at a critical time when consumer trust in social media\u2014a key tool for small businesses\u2014is declining. According to iStock\u2019s VisualGPS research platform, 81% of consumers don\u2019t trust social media content, citing concerns over misinformation. However, trust in businesses remains high, with 64% of people favoring businesses over celebrities or influencers, or even politicians, and 58% preferring brands whose values align with their own. For small businesses, this is a powerful opportunity to leverage their local ties and authentic engagement to build stronger connections and outpace larger competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Rebecca Swift, Senior Vice President of Creative for iStock, emphasizes the need for a bold shift: \u201cAs we enter 2025, trust will define success, and visual content will be a critical tool in forging genuine connections with audiences. For small businesses, the advantage lies not in chasing polished perfection but in creating visuals that feel human, honest, and deeply relevant. By telling real stories and reflecting diverse experiences, small businesses can establish deep, lasting trust with their audiences\u2013proving that it\u2019s not about looking perfect but about feeling real and relatable.\u201d\n\nHere are iStock\u2019s key marketing trends to help SMBs build trust in 2025:\n\nReal Talk: Less Influencer, More Real-User Content\n\nThe genuine feel that made influencer content connect with people is disappearing. VisualGPS revealed, 67% of people believe traditional ads are more authentic than sponsored influencer posts. Even if you don\u2019t use influencers, this shift matters. People are tired of content that looks too perfect and want visuals that feel genuine and honest. A few years ago, User-Generated Content (UGC), like selfies and vertical videos, was seen as the most real and authentic. But in 2025, people expect more. This is where Real-User Content (RUC) comes in, a new concept from iStock experts which encourages businesses to move from \"generated\" content to images and videos that show \u201creal.\u201d\n\nThis change is affecting how people interact with visual content, especially on social media. Despite people\u2019s lack of trust, they still find these platforms valuable, 82% of users still go to places like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts for video content to learn something new or get inspiration. In other words, people want the benefits of social media, without the negative effects. This shift has also made video-driven social search more popular, where platforms focused on video are no longer just for scrolling \u2014they\u2019ve become places to search and discover. In 2025, to succeed, you need to speak directly to your audience, this approach will always be more effective than a flood of generic posts.\n\n\n\n\n\nHonesty: The New Face of Authenticity\n\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to marketing trends, you\u2019ve probably seen the word \u201cauthenticity\u201d everywhere. But what does it truly mean? For consumers, it means being real, truthful, and original, according to VisualGPS research. And in 2025, it will still be key to building trust\u201498% of people say authentic images and videos are important for earning trust. However, authenticity is changing. In 2025, it\u2019s will be about radical honesty. People don\u2019t want perfect images\u2014they want to see what makes your business human, imperfections and all.\n\nSharing raw moments, real customer stories, and the messy, behind-the-scenes parts of running a business can create strong emotional connections. Being honest is important\u2014whether it's showing how your processes work to teach your audience or admitting when things don\u2019t go as planned. Even humor, when used carefully, can turn simple interactions into memorable moments. In a world full of overly polished content, honesty will help your brand stand out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Next Frontier: Trust-Centric AI for Forward-Thinking Businesses\n\nText-to-image Generative AI is a powerful tool for businesses of all sizes. However, in 2025, its successful use will depend on being transparent. While consumers are open to AI-generated ads, 86% believe it should be clearly labeled, and 74% are okay with AI-generated content IF used ethically. This means using AI to empower, not to mislead. Also, as ethical AI becomes the standard, using tools that offer commercially safe AI images with legal protection\u2014just like any other royalty-free image\u2014not only gives you peace of mind but also positions your business as a leader in responsible AI use, aligning with the values your audience expect.\n\nOn top of that, beyond creating images from scratch think of AI as a virtual studio that helps your team create flexible, cost-effective content. AI tools like iStock\u2019s AI generator, allow businesses to not only generate custom images from creative prompts but also modify visuals, remove or change elements, and expand canvases to fit specific formats\u2014all without needing expensive software or design skills. This tool even lets businesses upload reference images and product photos to build a personalized library of assets, making it quicker and easier to align visuals with your business needs, pace, and budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs 2025 approaches, the key to success for SMBs is embracing trust-first strategies. By focusing on Real-User Content, being radically honest, and using AI transparently, small businesses can not only stay ahead of the curve but also lead the way in making trust the foundation of modern marketing.\n\nTo inspire and elevate your visual marketing strategy ahead of 2025 with related imagery and videos, visit https://www.istockphoto.com/.\n\nMedia contact:\n\nIlse Noguez\n\n[email protected]\n\nPhotos accompanying this announcement are available at:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9508cf80-f5a7-403f-819b-68c62617e25c\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f9cc203d-5c67-45a0-8e84-a6e001ad7acb\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/80078fc0-f37b-4b57-b58b-55c54c396f5a\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ef7c3bb1-ca44-4d03-83f5-0d5f80c8af52\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f860a42a-50ab-413a-b17e-75d09e83934c"

She has over twenty years of experience in AI/ML and has been through every phase of AI growth, from neural networks to deep learning, predictive, and now generative AI.

But as it looks to the future, it's all about building \"one platform that is trusted, simple, and smart.' Shani argue that every company has to leverage AI, but many are taking the wrong approach.\n\nThe questions companies do ask focus more on AI and how to monetize it. The questions they should be asking are: what is the value-add that automation or having a conversational agent brings to the customer experience, and how are you using AI as a tool? How will AI make you more productive, remove friction, or provide a better customer experience?\n\nIt\u2019s the difference, she says, between successful and less successful companies. If you are grounded by the customer problem you're trying to solve and figuring out how AI can help solve that problem, you will realize ROI and see successful adoption. Companies that sprinkle a little generative AI on something that doesn't materialize into a product or feature that customers want to adopt and buy will struggle.\n\nThe other challenge she sees is that the AI strategy doesn't necessarily align with the company strategy.\n\nI think that's the biggest kind of difference in terms of perspective on AI; AI is a very useful tool. It's a very powerful tool. And you need to know how to use these tools to solve problems. But it's not a magic solution for everything, and it's not a magical solution that is going to solve everything. So, knowing how to use it in a smart way to really focus on the customer. If it's better user experience, if it's better productivity, if it's creating shorter time to value because of automation, then you have a successful AI strategy.\n\nShani says Twilio is successful because it uses AI as a tool to improve customer engagement, security, and customer satisfaction.\n\nHow Twilio CEP uses AI\n\nTwilio is not for one department. It provides the tools to support the customer end-to-end. The CDP (customer data platform) gives them customer data, and the CPaaS (communications platform as a service) provides the \"last mile connection\" - email, SMS, and voice interactions. Bringing them together creates customer engagement across the entire customer lifecycle. AI is used throughout the CEP. Shani cites the example of Fraud Guard, Twilio\u2019s first product to market, which provides SMS protection. They developed predictive AI models for this product, which they continually tune:\n\nIn Twilio, for example, in our Fraud Guard product that I mentioned before. It was never about, okay, how do we monetize predictive AI? We were grounded in solving a problem that was real and increasing, especially now in the age of AI, of spam, and impersonation. So when we built Fraud Guard, it was always the intention: how do we protect our customers, how do we create these secure communications, and we see real value? We see real savings for our customers who are using the product. And they never once asked us, are you using LLMs? Are you using predictive AI? It was not even a question. So, it was not about how you're monetizing it. But it's more in terms of what is the value that I'm getting?\n\nBut Shani is also looking into leveraging AI in the Segment business, focusing on customer data and engagement. Here, predictive audiences help companies understand what their customers are trying to do, how they will behave, and what the next best action for them is.\n\nIn addition, Twilio has launched generative AI products across communications, including their personalized IVR and Flex contact center product with a copilot agent. In this product, an AI assistant helps agents be more helpful to customers by providing advice and recommendations, sentiment analysis, and summarizing conversations.\n\nWhat\u2019s changing for developers\n\nWith a ten-million-strong developer community, it makes sense that Shani would have a strong view of how AI is affecting developers.\n\nWe are hearing more and more that in the next five years, everyone will be a developer. Shani doesn\u2019t agree. She reckons there is a big difference between a developer and a builder. Yes, everyone can use an AI tool and build something, she said. You can write better content and better code, but that doesn\u2019t make you a software developer:\n\nIt's kind of a new language that developers need to learn how to use and how to use it well.\n\nShani pitches that AI is a productivity and assistant tool, with rhe caveat that you need to know what questions to ask to get the right answer.\n\nYou see the evolution of software development languages all the time. And I think when I'm looking from a software developer perspective, what we see right now, with all these copilot assistants to write code, is really about making a developer much more productive so they can focus on getting the full value out of their time writing code which is something that they didn't have before.\n\nShani sees three themes in how AI is impacting software development. First, developers need enough software skills to validate that the AI-generated code is good and does what they want it to.\n\nSecond, AI uses data to create code, but there\u2019s a creative aspect to people that Shani doesn\u2019t see AI replacing in the near future.\n\nFinally, Shani believes there will be a shift in how developers think about code. Before, it was all about generating code to solve a problem. Now, it\u2019s thinking about systems design and overall architecture from the start. And it\u2019s about user experience, something that is becoming very critical in the world of AI, she said.\n\nWhat does this mean for developers exactly?\n\nShe explains:\n\nIf we're using an AI tool to write a document, we don't just copy, paste, and call it done. The same needs to be done in code. You have to validate whatever the AI assistant has been generating. I think that's one element. And the second thing that I advise computer science students asking me similar questions is you need to learn the basics without AI. You need to learn how to be a software developer before you earn the right to use an AI tool because you need to be able to look into the code. You need to be able to look into the product that you have generated and know if it's good or not. Because, if not, and that goes back to then, we don't really need you because that's the validation that is missing if you delegate the entire creation of a code to an AI assistant.\n\nThe key to consider here is how students are taught computer science today. Not all universities have embraced AI trends\u2014not for developers, marketers, or writers. Shani said she is seeing some effort to figure it out. But there is a balance to find. You want students to learn to code without AI first, but you also want them to learn to leverage AI tools to help them be more productive and efficient.\n\nAt the same time, these schools also need to devote more teaching time to the thinking and designing aspects of systems development. There aren't likely many schools teaching user experience in computer science courses\u2014at least not as a core subject.\n\nMy take\n\nI appreciated Shani's perspective on how organizations should think about AI. By focusing on the customer and creating better experiences, it's easy to find ways to leverage AI. Incorporating AI into a product without thinking about what benefits it truly brings may have been okay at first, but it isn't the right approach today.\n\nI also liked how she talked about developers' use of AI. This is very similar to how content marketers and writers can use AI\u2014as an assistant, as another tool. It doesn't replace the need to understand the work; it's simply a way to take more of the basic operations out of the hands of developers so they can spend more time designing products and experiences that customers will love.\n\nDoes this mean companies won't replace developers? Not necessarily. As I have said before, with AI and writers, some will get replaced. It's just the way things go. What developers want to do is find the companies that understand the true value of AI in the toolkit. And it sounds like Twilio is one of those companies."

(Fuzzy on the difference between dark energy and dark matter? Read our Fundamentals newsletter from May.) Experimenters hunting for hypothesized dark matter particles known as WIMPs \u2014 heavy, inert particles that were long considered the top candidate for the nonreflective stuff floating in and around galaxies \u2014 hit a limit. Detectors have become so sensitive that they\u2019re now picking up the glow of neutrinos from the sun, which blinds them to any subtler signals. \u201cSo that\u2019s kind of the end of the WIMP detection era,\u201d the Stanford University physicist Natalia Toro told us.\n\nShe and other dark matter hunters have switched gears and now seek new dark matter candidates, especially lightweight but abundant particles that would come in multiple species. \u201cThe most common hypothesis is that this is somehow simple. Why on Earth should we expect that?\u201d said Philip Schuster, also a Stanford physicist, voicing an increasingly common sentiment among specialists.\n\nLest you suspect that dark matter is the Ptolemaic epicycle of the 21st century \u2014 a long-believed but convoluted and ultimately erroneous model of the universe \u2014 astronomers discovered a new reason to think it\u2019s really out there. The finding, an object called MACS J0018.5, has proved so compelling that people are referring to it as the new Bullet Cluster. In the original Bullet Cluster \u2014 long considered one of the single most persuasive pieces of evidence for dark matter\u2019s existence \u2014 we see two enormous clusters of galaxies crashing together. The colliding gas glows brightly in the center of the crash site, but most of the matter has sailed right through, forming heavy, light-distorting blobs on either side. That\u2019s how dark matter particles would behave, because they don\u2019t (or barely) interact.\n\nMACS J0018.5 is similar, except the galaxy clusters are merging along our line of sight. Researchers effectively pointed a radar gun at them and found that their visible gas has slowed as it collides while the majority of the mass moves faster, unimpeded by the collision.\n\nThese merging clusters are hard to explain without invoking the kind of invisible particles we\u2019re looking for."

Since the 1800s, only 6 samples have ever been documented worldwide, and all but one of these was from New Zealand. From a scientific and conservation point of view, this is huge.\u201d"

            "article_content": "What do you get from doing a ChatGPT search?\n\nUp-to-date results, but with no ads. That's the anti-Google jaggernaut open OpenAI has unleashed, at least for now.\n\nGoogle remains dominant for traditional searches. But AI tools like ChatGPT, powered by the so-called large language models (LLMs) and ultra-high speed computing, are redefining how people interact with information.\n\nSearch-engine war heats up\n\nOn Monday (December 16), San Francisco-based OpenAI announced that its internet search feature powered by ChatGPT will now be available to all users globally, both free and paid.\n\nWill ChatGPT steamroll Google's highly-coveted territory of multi-trillion dollar ads-driven revenue business model?\n\nIt's early days.\n\nGoogle: A tough nut to crack\n\nAnd even if it does, perhaps not immediately. While AI-driven search like ChatGPT challenges traditional methods, Google's robust infrastructure, massive ad network, and years of dominance make it resilient.\n\nHowever, long-term disruption is possible if OpenAI and similar players redefine how information is monetized and delivered.\n\nGoogle (parent company: Alphabet) currently has a market capitalisation of $2.42 trillion as of Monday (December 16, 2024).\n\nIf OpenAI cracks a new AI-driven, ads-sustainable business model, it could force Google to rethink its entire approach.\n\nUltimately, it will come down to user preference \u2014 whether people prefer AI-generated answers over Google's ad-supported search experience.\n\nWhat happened before\n\nPreviously exclusive to ChatGPT Plus subscribers, this upgrade brings real-time web searches to hundreds of millions of users, marking a significant challenge to Google\u2019s search dominance.\n\nThe feature, launched in late October, allows users to access \u201cfast, timely answers\u201d supplemented with links to relevant web sources, eliminating the need to toggle between ChatGPT and traditional search engines.\n\nWhat OpenAI said\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing search to all logged-in free users of ChatGPT,\u201d said Kevin Weil, OpenAI\u2019s Chief Product Officer, in a YouTube video. \u201cIt\u2019ll be available globally across every platform where ChatGPT is used.\u201d\n\nHow It Works Unlike Google\u2019s ad-heavy results, ChatGPT\u2019s interface offers a clean, conversational experience, similar to AI-powered search platforms like Perplexity.\n\n\n\nIt provides answers alongside source citations, enhancing transparency and reliability. Users can activate this feature via a web search icon within ChatGPT or enable it by default.\n\nUp-to-date results\n\nAdam Fry, ChatGPT\u2019s Search Product Lead, emphasised the importance of up-to-date results. \u201cWe\u2019re really just improving the ChatGPT experience with current web information,\u201d he explained.\n\nThis addresses a key limitation faced by AI models like ChatGPT and Claude, which rely on data cutoffs and lack access to real-time information.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft\u2019s AI-powered tools already integrate live search results with AI-generated answers, and this move aligns OpenAI more closely with their offerings.\n\n3 ways ChatGPT poses competition to Google: \u2022 Conversational search experience: ChatGPT offers a more interactive and personalised search experience. Instead of sifting through multiple links, users receive direct, human-like answers tailored to their queries, reducing time spent finding information.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Content generation: While Google connects users to resources, ChatGPT creates content. From writing articles, summarising topics, to drafting emails or code, ChatGPT's generative capabilities provide actionable solutions immediately.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Task automation: ChatGPT can perform tasks like brainstorming ideas, analyzing data, or coding assistance\u2014 roles that typically require additional tools or detailed manual searches on Google.\n\nImpact\n\nThis update underscores OpenAI\u2019s ambitions to position itself as a major player in internet search, challenging Google\u2019s near-monopoly and Microsoft\u2019s Bing.\n\n$ 180 b total value of search engine market (mostly advertising driven)\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, the global search engine market is valued at $180 billion and heavily driven by advertising\u2014a business model that OpenAI appears to sidestep with its minimalist design.\n\nHowever, the rollout comes with a cost.\n\nComputing needs\n\nScaling real-time web searches to hundreds of millions of users will dramatically increase OpenAI\u2019s computing needs and operational expenses.\n\nCEO Sam Altman recently led OpenAI to a $157 billion valuation, supported by major investors like Microsoft, SoftBank, and Nvidia, all of whom stand to benefit from OpenAI\u2019s growing market share.\n\nBroader implications\n\nExperts predict this move could reshape the search engine landscape. Dr. Paul Clements, a tech industry analyst, said:\n\n\u201cOpenAI\u2019s integration of search into ChatGPT combines the convenience of conversational AI with live web data. Google may face serious pressure to innovate beyond its ad-dependent model.\u201d\n\nWhat users can expect\n\nWhile OpenAI refrains from launching a separate search product, this integration highlights its ability to blend generative AI with live internet data, offering a seamless alternative to search engines like Google.\n\nAs competition intensifies, one thing is clear: the way we search for information on the internet is evolving\u2014and OpenAI is leading the charge."

            "article_content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nMachine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become essential technologies across industries, automating tasks at a speed and scale far beyond human capabilities. However, building these systems at scale requires deep engineering expertise and skilled teams to ensure success.\n\nNiloy Gupta, Machine Learning Engineer Tech Lead at Attentive Mobile, is an expert in scaling machine learning systems for various industry verticals. Gupta\u2019s experience spans critical roles, including CTO of Lambent Logic and a pivotal position in scaling Affirm\u2019s Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) platform, one of the largest in the U.S. He was also instrumental in scaling Yelp\u2019s Ads Targeting system. Niloy holds a graduate degree from the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. His research focused on machine learning systems.\n\nEngineering AI/ML Applications\n\nNiloy\u2019s journey as a technology leader showcases his ability to build scalable AI/ML systems for diverse industries. At Affirm, he contributed to production-scale systems while advancing model interpretability.\n\nNiloy shares, \u201cAI/ML models must be interpretable to understand why a loan is approved or denied. If a FinTech company were to deny a loan, they would be legally obligated to tell the consumer why their loan application was rejected. As a result, companies are biased toward simpler and more interpretable models.\u201d\n\nNiloy\u2019s work reflects the complexities of regulated FinTech systems, where model updates need regularity approval, in contrast to AdTech\u2019s fast feedback cycles and rapid iterations.\n\nAt Yelp, he developed a distributed ML training system and online model inference to handle billions of training samples and efficiently ensure real-time predictions. Leveraging distributed computing tools, Niloy built a fault-tolerant system optimized for cost and performance.\n\n\u201cSince model predictions need to be served in real-time, having a model inference service that meets the SLA requirements is paramount. We applied novel model compression techniques to reduce the memory footprint of the model and thereby reduce cache misses,\u201d Niloy notes.\n\nNiloy\u2019s ability to adapt engineering principles to meet industry-specific challenges demonstrates his expertise. He blends technical skills with leadership to create high-impact AI/ML solutions in finance and advertising.\n\nBuilding large-scale AI/ML systems\n\nAI/ML systems intersect with machine learning theory and software engineering. The system should scale to large data sets, train models reliably and cost-effectively, and serve the model predictions while meeting latency requirements. All these stages must be monitored effectively to catch any degradation or bugs. The system should also support failure management and rollbacks.\n\nAn engineering team needs to leverage the right technologies and tools to automate all three stages of a machine learning system\u2014feature generation, model training, and model serving. These include distributed computing, microservices, security, and feature stores.\n\nThe design of the AI/ML system also depends upon the industry vertical and product. Typically, in credit underwriting, labels (defaults or repayments) arrive weeks, if not months, after the loans have been issued. This creates a long lag between model deployment and evaluation. Investing in a reliable experimentation platform is crucial for any company working with AI/ML models.\n\nNiloy\u2019s career reflects his ability to solve these challenges efficiently, ensuring models perform well and comply with industry standards. His expertise is building robust, high-performance systems that balance regulatory demands with technical innovation.\n\nAI/ML system quality assurance\n\nBuilding effective AI/ML systems requires careful planning, from data collection to model monitoring, based on Niloy\u2019s experience. He shares, \u201cThe first AI/ML model provides the biggest lift to the product, so it should be kept simple. This allows the engineering team to focus on infrastructure where typically more issues lie.\u201d\n\nGood data is essential\u2014ML models can only perform as well as the training data they are fed. Niloy emphasizes the importance of validating data to catch issues like missing values and shifts in distribution. Features must be cataloged with ownership if they originate from multiple sources, ensuring accountability.\n\nMonitoring is critical for maintaining performance over time. Niloy explains, \u201cAny AI/ML pipelines should invest in monitoring. The major one is checking for any training-serving skew. If the data at inference time has a different distribution than what was used for training, the model performance could not meet expectations.\u201d\n\nTo address challenges like feedback loops and skew, Niloy recommends piping inference data back into training pipelines and reusing code between training and serving environments. Testing models on holdout datasets ensures robustness beyond the original training data.\n\nWhile complex to build, these pipelines ultimately automate processes and unlock new growth opportunities.\n\nNiloy\u2019s expertise and contributions to production-scale machine learning reflect engineers' vital role in shaping the future of AI/ML across industries."

            "article_content": "\"It can be installed on a police cruiser,\" said the radar company director.\n\nHigh-tech radar used in Ukraine-Russia war to be deployed to crack Northeast drone mystery\n\nState-of-the-art drone-hunting technology being used on the battlefield in Ukraine could soon be deployed to crack the mystery behind a spate of unmanned flying objects purportedly spotted in the skies over New Jersey, New York and other Northeast cities, experts said.\n\nNew York Sen. Chuck Schumer and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul have asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to deploy the Robin Radar System to assist investigators in getting to the bottom of who is behind the alleged drones that residents and local and state officials say have been flying over communities at night since mid-November.\n\n\"I want to see a flock of Robin-like technology systems deployed across the New York city metropolitan area so we need the Department of Homeland Security to spring into action,\" Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor on Monday.\n\nThis photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP, FILE\n\nDrone sightings have also been reported in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Ohio. The Boston Police Department said Sunday that two men were arrested Saturday night after they allegedly flew a drone \"dangerously close to Logan International Airport.\"\n\nWhat is the Robin Radar System?\n\nKris Brost, general director of Robin Radar USA Inc., whose parent company is in the Netherlands, told ABC News that the development of his firm's Iris drone detection radar system evolved from its innovation in creating radar to detect flocks of birds near airports to prevent them from striking aircraft.\n\nSince 2014, the company has pivoted to developing drone-detecting technology to not only locate drones \u2013 officially designated unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \u2013 but to \"classify small moving objects, whether they be drones, rotary, fixed-wing or if you just want to filter them out because you don't want to see birds or large crickets,\" Brost said.\n\nThe Robin Radas System deployed at an undisclosed location to detect drones. Robin Radar USA Inc.\n\nBrost said the Robin radar can discern drones from manned-operated aircraft, track their flying patterns in real time and beam data back to a laptop computer with a 360-degree, 3D view of the airspace in which the object is flying.\n\n\u201cBasically what a radar does is a radar bounces radio waves off of objects,\" said Brost, adding that the Robin radar can also read a drone's radio frequency: \"There\u2019s a sophisticated term called \u2018radar cross section\u2019 and that really comes down to what is that material made of, how fast is it moving, what altitude it\u2019s at, etc.\"\n\nKris Brost, director of Robin Radar USA Inc., speaks of technology to be used in cracking the mystery of the spate of drone sightings across skies in the Northeast. ABC News\n\nBrost said the radar system has a range of about 3.1 miles and can detect objects flying at an altitude of two to three kilometers, roughly between one and two miles.\n\nWhen combined with other technologies, Brost said the radar system can help investigators obtain a drone's remote identification. Brost warned, however, that operators are able to modify their drones in order to avoid detection, including removing the remote ID broadcast module.\n\n\"Even if someone is trying to skirt the system, we\u2019ll be able to detect them,\" Brost said. \"We won\u2019t tell you where the person is flying from, but we\u2019ll be able to help you track them.\"\n\nBrost said another advantage of the company's Robin system is that it's lightweight and mobile: \"it can be installed on a police cruiser or whatever you need to and be used on the move.\"\n\nOne thing his company's radar system can't do, however, is determine whether a drone has been weaponized.\n\n\"We don\u2019t necessarily look at payload,\" Brost said.\n\nBrost said that at the request of New Jersey authorities, his company sent a team to the state on Friday to assess how to best deploy the Robin radar in the investigation of the numerous alleged nighttime drone sightings.\n\nAsked if DHS has contacted his company, Brost could only say he is working with the federal government.\n\nThe FBI and DHS have deployed infrared cameras and drone detection technology to ensure that the purported drones flying over the New Jersey and New York area aren't harmful, according to a law enforcement source. Dozens of agencies have been out daily to find answers and track down any operators acting \"illegally or with nefarious intent,\" the FBI said recently.\n\nThe agencies are also looking at social media and other photos to determine what exactly is in the photos. Most of the photos and video depict manned aircraft, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nDeployed in Ukraine\n\nThe Robin Radar System has been used in the Ukraine-Russia war to aid Ukrainian military forces in locating incoming Russian weaponized drones, Brost told ABC News.\n\n\"The war in the Ukraine was really a turning point for our company based on the compelling needs they have and certainly some of the data that we\u2019ve been able to collect and implement based on that environment has been specular,\" Brost said. \"Having talked to some of the battlefield commanders, it\u2019s pretty compelling how important of a technology that it is.\"\n\nRobin Radar System workers use the technology in the field to determine in 3D where drones are detected. Robin Radar USA Inc.\n\nWhile on the battlefield, Ukrainian forces have shot the Russian drones out of the sky, Brost said.\n\n\"Here in the states, law enforcement's hands are very tied because they can't use anything to take a drone out of the sky even if they find it's nefarious or think it's nefarious,\" Brost said.\n\nThe Robin Radar System could soon be deployed to get to the bottom of the rash of drone sighting over Northeast cities. Robin Radar USA Inc.\n\nThe New Jersey State Police and FBI field office in Newark issued an advisory Monday asking the public not to take matters into their own hands. In a statement, authorities warned of \u201can increase in pilots of manned aircraft being hit in the eyes with lasers because people on the ground think they see an Unmanned Aircraft Systems. There is also a concern with people possibly firing weapons at what they believe to be a UAS but could be a manned aircraft.\"\n\n\"Public hysteria\"\n\nThe FBI has received more than 5,000 tips in the last few weeks about drone sightings in New Jersey and other states, said the statement issued jointly on Monday by DHS, the FBI, the FAA and the Department of Defense. Those tips have resulted in about 100 leads but, so far, the investigation has not found \"anything anomalous,\" nor do the drone sightings present a national security or public safety risk, the federal officials.\n\nAn assessment of the purported drone sightings, according to the joint statement, found that they reflect combined sightings of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and stars mistakenly reported as drones.\n\n\u201cMy suspicion is this is a situation that has become one where there\u2019s public hysteria that\u2019s largely due to the fact that the government did not clearly explain what was going on at first and hasn\u2019t differentiated and been as open and gotten in front of the story,\" said Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington D.C. think tank.\n\nBrost said he has examined images of drones spotted flying over New Jersey.\n\n\"I have seen pictures where I\u2019ve said, \u2018Man, that looks like a dead ringer for an aircraft.'\" Brost said. \"But I have seen some pretty compelling videos on something that just looks unexplainable.\""

            "article_content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nRumor mill: Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips, which spearheaded a recent push to promote Arm-based Windows, have exclusively powered laptops so far. However, new reports suggest that the company's next-generation lineup will fulfill its promise to expand into desktops following its canceled mini PC.\n\nEstablished leaker Roland Quandt believes the previously leaked follow-up to Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite series of CPUs is intended for desktops. Numerous laptops featuring the chips launched earlier this year running an Arm-based version of Windows, and the company aims to expand into other form factors.\n\nThe Snapdragon X2 Elite (or possibly X Elite 2), codenamed Project Glymur, initially appeared in international import-export databases in late September, according to WinFuture. Hardware details are scarce, but Qualcomm previously used special housing to test the NAND and RAM chips for a new flagship processor with the model number SC8480XP.\n\nI think Qualcomm is coming for the desktop with Snapdragon \"X Elite 2\". They're testing \"Project Glymur\" SC8480XP with an AIO liquid cooler feat 120mm fan(s?), just like what you'd use in a (gaming) desktop \u2013 Roland Quandt (@rquandt.bsky.social) December 9, 2024 at 8:26 PM\n\nQuandt reports that the company has begun testing the CPU with AIO liquid coolers resembling those typically used for gaming desktops, suggesting Qualcomm is aiming for higher-end sectors. Snapdragon X Elite laptops have demonstrated modest gaming performance thus far, but seeing what they can accomplish with higher power budgets could be intriguing.\n\nThe company announced plans to bring Snapdragon to all PC form factors at a July Computex presentation but has since remained silent on the subject. Qualcomm unveiled a Snapdragon X Elite mini PC for use as a dev kit earlier in the year but abruptly ceased selling and supporting the device in October.\n\nGeekom might become the first company to release a Snapdragon X desktop. The mini PC manufacturer hasn't formally announced the device, but a leaked promo image reveals that it will be called the QS series and house the top-end X Elite CPU in an aluminum chassis.\n\nAlthough various laptop manufacturers released new models featuring Qualcomm's chips, they haven't amassed a significant presence in the overall PC market yet. Lower prices, which the company promises will come next year, could help attract customers.\n\nGenAI is a primary selling point of Snapdragon X Elite and other \"AI PC\" processors, but users have shown little interest in the technology. Instead, Qualcomm's main advantage might be longer battery life, with some laptops featuring the company's chips lasting a whole day on a single charge.\n\nThe likelihood of desktops running Windows on Arm is expected to increase with the emergence of Arm CPUs from other manufacturers. Nvidia has teased plans for one in 2025, and Arm previously stated that more clients are preparing chips."

Since the 1800s, only 6 samples have ever been documented worldwide, and all but one of these was from New Zealand. From a scientific and conservation point of view, this is huge.\u201d"

            "source": "Rolling Stone",
            "article_content": "For the past month, residents of the northeast and mid-Atlantic U.S. have made thousands of reports and social media posts about supposed sightings of suspicious drones and unidentified aerial objects at night. And because government agencies have not provided an explanation as sensational as people believe their photo and video \u201cevidence\u201d to be, the public has begun to run wild with outlandish conspiracy theories, ranging from foreign spy operations to extraterrestrial visitation.\n\nThe FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Department of Defense on Monday tried to quell the hysteria with a joint statement that read: \u201cWe assess that the sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and stars mistakenly reported as drones.\u201d Even the iconic Goodyear Blimp was thought to be a UFO by someone who captured images of it on their phone. (The official term for what was once categorized as an Unidentified Flying Object, or UFO, is now Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAP, which includes \u201cany objects in air, sea or space that defies scientific explanation,\u201d per the Defense Department)\n\nYet to the more paranoid amateur investigators, this nothing-to-see-here response, along with continued agency assurances that no one is endangered by aircraft they may have seen, are proof of a cover-up. Indeed, President-elect Donald Trump himself suggested in a Monday press conference that the government and military both knew exactly what was going on but weren\u2019t telling the American people. Statements of concern from other politicians about a lack of transparency \u2014 including from a Pennsylvania state legislator who fell for misinformation in which a Star Wars spaceship model being transported by truck was labeled a \u201ccrashed drone\u201d \u2014 encouraged further speculation.\n\nOne of the most prominent unfounded theories at the moment is that the alleged drones are searching for radioactive material. This was an idea floated, without evidence, by John Furgeson, CEO of Saxon Aerospace, a Kansas-based company that makes unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). In a TikTok video posted over the weekend that has since been viewed more than 1.5 million times, Furgeson posited that \u201cif [the objects] are drones, the only reason why they would be flying, and flying that low, is because they\u2019re trying to smell something on the ground.\u201d This could include gas leaks or radiation, he said. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nDifferent and increasingly extreme versions of this hypothetical made the rounds until some were convinced that any suspected drones were searching for a nuclear warhead. \u201cAnyone hearing rumors of a smuggled suitcase nuke or dirty bomb that got through customs or something like that?\u201d wrote a commenter on the Facebook group \u201cNew Jersey Mystery Drones \u2013 let\u2019s solve it,\u201d which has more than 75,000 members. (Northern New Jersey has been the epicenter of the supposed drone activity.) Another commented, \u201cI talked to a friend in the military who also works with drones, he said 100% these are our drones and they would only be used in such excess for a serious reasons and gave examples like: Tracking nuclear fallout from a dirty bomb that went off, tracking biological weapons, tracking [weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nMore fear-mongering came from no less reputable a source than Bethenny Frankel of The Real Housewives of New York City, who in a TikTok likewise claimed to have heard the search theory from a trusted source: in this case, a \u201cguy\u201d whose dad \u201cworked with the Pentagon and NASA and, like, secret projects.\u201d Frankel said this person had told her any drones \u201ccould very possibly be sniffing out something very dangerous.\u201d The video has been viewed 1.7 million times since she posted it on Monday. And on Tuesday, Michael Melham, the mayor of Belleville, New Jersey, appeared on the local Fox affiliate show Good Day New York, where he lent credence to the \u201cradioactive material\u201d theory, noting that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission had earlier in December confirmed that a shipment of such content had gone missing in the state. Related Content\n\nBut the missing object is an Eckert & Ziegler HEGL-0132, a piece of medical scanning equipment that was being shipped for safe disposal, and the radiation it contains rates less than a Category 3 on the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s scale, which means it is \u201cvery unlikely to cause permanent injury to individuals,\u201d according to the NRC report. While certain drones are equipped to conduct radiological surveys, it would be incredibly surprising if this piece of equipment accounted for thousands of reported drone sightings from Virginia up to New England and as far west as Ohio.\n\nWhile aliens have long been a popular explanation of UAPs \u2014 and many have argued that images now circulating online show extraterrestrial crafts \u2014 some have brought up so-called Project Blue Beam, a conspiracy theory originated by the late Canadian conspiracist Serge Monast. In the Nineties, Monast predicted that NASA and the United Nations would use advanced technology to fake an alien invasion or encounter, deceiving countries into falling under a totalitarian New World Order. \u201cI believe these may be some sort of projection, hologram, or illusion based on several factors,\u201d wrote a member of the New Jersey drone investigation group, echoing this concept. \u201cMeaning, they are not REAL, they are essentially images being used to incite mass hysteria in the US.\u201d Others theorized that the UAPs could be computer-generated phantoms or referenced Project Blue Beam by name, arguing that the visual phenomena were staged.\n\nIncreased attention to aircraft has meanwhile prompted a glut of commentary on flying objects \u201cspraying\u201d the ground below with unknown substances. This is of a piece with the enduring conspiracy theory which holds that planes emit \u201cchemtrails\u201d in their wake, chemical agents used to poison or manipulate the general populace. (In reality, these cloudy streaks are contrails, formed from water vapor that has condensed and frozen around particles found in plane exhaust.) A user on X, formerly Twitter, with a quarter of a million followers, on Monday shared a video taken in New Jersey of a plane leaving contrails in the sky, and asked: \u201cWhat is this craft releasing? Could it be a biological attack from an unknown adversary? Or something even more sinister?\u201d\n\nAnother faction of conspiracists are fixated on flying objects they refer to not as drones but \u201corbs,\u201d pinpoints of hovering or moving light. There are claims about orbs turning into \u201ccrafts\u201d on video or interacting with similar orbs \u2014 although some seem convinced that orbs and drones are shooting each other down. (The so-called orbs have occasionally been referred to as \u201cplasmoids,\u201d a real effect observed in physics, though without anything to back up this identification.) A redditor offered an especially convoluted theory on the topic: \u201cThe real phenomenon are the orbs not the drones,\u201d they wrote in the comments on a video of aerial lights over Phoenix. \u201cThe drones are military. The government either infested the skies with drones to take the public\u2019s focus away from the orbs (which are being spotted much more rarely than the drones) or to use the drones for surveillance of the orbs. Or both.\u201d Trending Stories Dems Choose 74-Year-Old Gerry Connolly Over AOC for Key Committee Role What the \u2018I Slept With 100 Men in One Day\u2019 Doc Gets Right About Sex Work Trump\u2019s Felony Conviction Stands, Judge Rules Big-Band Leader Glenn Miller Vanished 80 Years Ago. His Death Started the 'Legacy' Band Trend\n\nPerhaps even worse than this kind of eccentric nonsense is the trend of people within conspiracy groups on social media asking AI chatbots to interpret the wave of purported drone sightings. One woman asked Meta\u2019s Llama program for the \u201chighest probable\u201d answer to the mystery and shared the screenshot of the bot\u2019s response and shared a screenshot of the bot\u2019s response on Facebook. Llama answered, \u201cI\u2019d speculate that the highest probably origin of the NJ drones is China, with a probability of around 60-70%.\u201d The chatbot observed that \u201cthe drones seem to be coming from the ocean, which could suggest a maritime launch platform.\u201d China, of course, has no military or naval presence in the Atlantic \u2014 because the U.S. has made diplomatic efforts to prevent it.\n\nStill, Meta\u2019s software was no further off-base than the multitudes spinning their own fantastic tales of an insidious drone fleet. When the plausible, boring answer simply won\u2019t do, everyone and everything \u2014 AI included \u2014 apparently has to pull a more exciting possibility out of thin air."

            "article_content": "A UFO expert believes that aliens could invade Earth at any moment and warned that they \"will make themselves known\".\n\nCarl Nally, of UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), issued the chilling warning after unexplained flying objects were spotted near military facilities. The mystery sightings came in the US, UK and Germany. Mr Nally said sightings are on the rise and believes there could be a portal for aliens to enter and exit Earth.\n\nAccording to Mr Nally, the secret entrance is nestled in the middle of Ireland between Athlone and Slane. His claims come after US authorities said they were unable to establish the origin of the objects. \"We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus,\" a White House official said last week.\n\nImage: X/@charliekirk11) X/@charliekirk11)\n\nMr Nally claimed that if the flashing lights that were spotted were simply drones, it would have been confirmed by now. He told the Irish Mirror: \"It\u2019s an amazing situation, the way we see it. You would imagine that, when anything appears over a military base, a military helicopter would go up and investigate them but they haven\u2019t done that.\n\n\u201cThey call them drones. Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\u201d\n\nMr Nally said the appearance of flying objects near military bases is part of an unprecedented global surge in UFO sightings over the past two months \u2013 including in Ireland, where several suspected UFOs have been spotted around Slane and Athlone. He suggested there were certain locations on the planet where UFOs enter from space and leave again, and claimed one such location may exist in the Irish midlands \u2013 explaining the uptick in sightings in recent weeks.\n\nImage: littlespacemochi/ Reddit) littlespacemochi/ Reddit) Image: littlespacemochi / Reddit) littlespacemochi / Reddit)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very peculiar that it\u2019s happening in a lot of places at the same time,\u201d said Mr Nally. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to that on this side of the world. At some point, they will make themselves known, and why not now?\u201d\n\nThe UFO expert said the recent sightings suggested extra-terrestrials were assessing military strength, and noted that UFOs had also been spotted in the vicinity of nuclear facilities. \"It seems to be some kind of observation that\u2019s going on at this point in time, and it seems to have increased, without a shadow of a doubt, and you would wonder,\" he claimed.\n\nMr Nally was relaxed about the prospect of an alien invasion, however, and suggested there were greater threats to mankind to worry about. \"If you put that [an alien invasion] on one side of the scales and AI [artificial intelligence] on the other, I\u2019d be more concerned about AI,\" he said.\n\nMr Nally has co-authored three books on aliens and UFOs with Dermot Butler, the most recent of which was Circle of Deceit. They are currently working on their fourth book."

            "article_content": "The bones were spread out across a nearly 50-foot ditch, thousands of them, bearing marks of a grisly end. Snapped femurs. Bashed skulls. Bones with slicing cuts, as if someone had butchered the skin around them.\n\nFor more than 50 years, the remains found in a shaft at the Charterhouse Warren Farm in southwest England have been a blip in British archaeological history. Discovered by cave explorers in 1970, the collection of mismatched bones seemed to be just another Bronze Age gravesite \u2014 a few victims scattered among sediment and animal skeletons.\n\nNow, a recent study published in the Cambridge University journal Antiquity suggests a stunningly grim saga played out at Charterhouse Warren, at far greater scale than previously thought: The bones belong to at least 37 men, women and children who were slaughtered and possibly eaten in a ceremonial feast after their massacre.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken us all aback. It was completely unexpected, totally atypical for the period and for almost all of British prehistory,\u201d said Rick Schulting, a professor of archaeology at Oxford University who led the study."

            "article_content": "JIN DING/CHINA DAILY\n\nEmployment is the most basic component of people's wellbeing. So the annual Central Economic Work Conference held from Dec 11 to 12 stressed focusing more on an employment-first strategy and ensuring stable employment for key groups.\n\nThe priority here is employment for college graduates, as promoting their high-quality and full employment has a bearing on the country's basic employment situation, the interests of every graduate and the healthy development of the economy and society.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the complex and ever-changing global situation, the authorities should pay attention to talent needs and lead the new trend of industrial development to balance the supply and demand of talent and alleviate structural employment contradictions. They should also strive to boost high-quality and full employment of graduates, who will face a more severe employment situation next year.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Education, the number of university graduates across China is projected to reach 12.22 million in 2025, up 430,000 from the previous year. Predictably, the number of graduates will remain high in the coming few years, and the job market will be overburdened from the oversupply of job-seeking graduates.\n\nIt is worth noting that a growing number of fresh university graduates will not start working right after graduation. The severe employment pressure has led many graduates to opt for delayed or flexible employment in their quest for stable jobs. While this has eased the tension in the job market to a certain extent, it has also made the overall employment situation more complicated.\n\nFrom the perspective of employers, new changes have taken place in the labor market. On the one hand, China's employment market is facing prominent overall pressure and structural problems due to rapid demographic changes, economic restructuring, and in-depth adjustments in the global industry chain. As a result, some traditional industries are undergoing transformation and upgrading, resulting in a decrease in job positions and a changing demand for talent.\n\nOn the other hand, while new industries have generated fresh job prospects, they are unable to accommodate all graduates. Overall, total employment pressure will coexist with prominent structural problems, and the demand has shifted from low-skilled and low-cost workers to high-quality employees.\n\nCurrently, there is a mismatch between graduate supply and demand in the job market. An increasing number of youth graduate every year, but some of them can hardly find suitable jobs.\n\nPlus, the development of artificial intelligence has impacted the concepts and models of traditional employment. The widespread application of AI has polarized the job market, with an increase in demand for high-skilled and highly creative jobs and significant reduction in low-skilled and repetitive jobs. But the supply and demand of such talents is unbalanced. One reason for this is that universities cannot cultivate enough talents to work in industries such as AI, new energy and semiconductors.\n\nIt will help if universities adjust the structure of disciplines to adapt to the economic and social development. Some newly emerged and interdisciplinary majors fail to cultivate sufficient talent to meet demand, while some traditional majors are producing an excess of graduates. It is noteworthy that many universities struggle to nurture students' core abilities such as innovation and creativity, resulting in a devaluation of academic qualifications.\n\nAs such, the governments at different levels, universities, enterprises and society should cooperate to introduce measures to optimize the supportive system of employment and improve the adaptability of talent supply and demand, to promote high-quality and full employment of graduates.\n\nFirst of all, favorable policies should be implemented to boost an employment-first strategy. Efforts should be made to strengthen coordination among fiscal subsidies, tax incentives, financial support and social security to unleash employment dividends.\n\nAmid a new wave of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, it is imperative for the government to institute a predictive mechanism for human resources. This mechanism should promptly release a catalogue of urgently required occupations, elucidating the labor market's demand orientation.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to promote modern industries to generate more employment opportunities. China should prioritize support for industries and enterprises with robust job creation capabilities to cultivate new drivers of growth. By developing new technologies and tapping into new markets, a modern industrial system can be established to create more fitting employment opportunities for graduates. Encouraging private firms and small to medium-sized enterprises to hire more graduates is also paramount.\n\nMeanwhile, it is necessary to improve a legal guarantee system for entrepreneurship to drive employment, introduce labor standards for new employment groups and encourage graduates to start their own businesses and find flexible employment. Hence, the pressure of economic transformation can be turned into employment potential.\n\nLast but not least, universities should reform by integrating their academic traditions, the expertise of their faculty, and regional advantages to establish emerging disciplines that can educate individuals capable of meeting the demands of new industries and business models. University personnel should engage with employers to understand evolving job requirements and innovate educational approaches. Moreover, graduates should receive guidance to make informed career decisions and adjust their salary expectations. Support should also be extended to assist economically disadvantaged young graduates in securing employment opportunities.\n\nThe author is vice-president and dean of the School of Labor Union at China University of Labor Relations.
