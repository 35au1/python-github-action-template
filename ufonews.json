            "article_content": "James Fox\u2019s documentary \u2018The Program\u2019 explores the reality behind the supposed existence of extraterrestrial beings through the alleged experiences of several former and retired US Army officials, including Jason Sands. The UFO whistleblower served in the Air Force as a master sergeant before concluding his career in 2007. As per reports, he is also one of the numerous individuals who have spoken to former intelligence official and whistleblower David Grusch about allegedly encountering UFOs. Jason\u2019s claims have shaken the online communities and platforms that study UAPs. Interestingly, his experience of allegedly meeting an alien, as he revealed in the documentary, forms one of the most detailed and vivid accounts delivered by a whistleblower in recent times! SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nJason Sands Served 22 Years in the Air Force\n\nJason Sands joined the US Air Force in 1985. His discharge/release certificate states that his primary specialties were electronic system security assessment and aircraft structural maintenance. However, after emerging as a UFO whistleblower, he claimed that he was part of several top-secret programs within the Air Force. In an interview given in April 2024, he alleged that one of his duties concerned understanding technology captured from non-human intelligence (NHI). He further added that he was a member of the \u201cRed Team,\u201d which was committed to monitoring exchanges between scientists, which apparently concerned numerous alien races at times. Despite these claims, there isn\u2019t any evidence in the public domain to prove that he was part of any missions that targeted extraterrestrial activity.\n\nJason\u2019s life supposedly turned around in 1994 when he allegedly met an extraterrestrial being while driving through the Nellis Air Force Base Complex in Nevada. As detailed in \u2018The Program,\u2019 he witnessed the apparent entity disappearing from Earth in a peculiar-looking craft. He shared this unverified experience with the documentarian James Fox, paving the way for his inclusion in the project. After meeting the former Air Force officer, the filmmaker investigated the claims and details concerning his tenure, only to be convinced about his credibility. After collaborating with Jason on the documentary, Fox accidentally revealed the former\u2019s identity, only for him to emerge as a whistleblower.\n\nJason Sands\u2019 Allegations and Claims Are Highly Contested\n\nJason Sands has been a significant presence in the online UFO research community since April 2024. He garnered immense attention with his claim of meeting an alien in 1994 and being part of several secret government programs. In an interview, he reportedly said he joined a UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomenon) task force forum in 2021 to contribute his supposed knowledge concerning \u201cblack projects.\u201d Even though many have accepted him and his words, several others have approached the same with critical eyes. After Jason released his Air Force release/discharge certificate in April 2024, a former UFO enthusiast raised suspicions concerning his alleged involvement in extraterrestrial research, which are not indicated in the \u201cproof\u201d he shared.\n\nFurthermore, in an interview with Spaced Out Radio in April 2024, Jason claimed he was \u201cforced to serve\u201d in the \u201c20 and Back Program.\u201d As per reports, it was described as a program in which participants spent 20 years in a Secret Space Program (SSP) to interact with extraterrestrial beings and visit military bases across the solar system. In 2022, a whistleblower named Corey Goode admitted that he fabricated the entire program to take advantage of his fans financially. Jason\u2019s alleged involvement in a fictional program turned numerous UFO enthusiasts against him, forcing him to describe the whole ordeal as a misunderstanding. He stated in April 2024 that \u201c20 and Back\u201d was an \u201cexperience\u201d for him rather than one official program.\n\nSimilarly, Jason\u2019s claim that he heard scientists discussing multiple alien races has also been scrutinized. In March 2024, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense published a report about the US government\u2019s involvement with UAP. The same offers insights about test and evaluation units with a nickname with \u2018alien\u2019 connotations, which can be what Jason apparently heard as an alleged member of the \u201cRed Team.\u201d\n\nJason Sands is Involved in the UAP Discourse While Working as a Consultant Today\n\nAs discussions and debates concerning Jason Sands\u2019 claims and allegations grow, he has been working as an independent consultant for the Department of Defense since August 2024. The whistleblower is currently based in Gaithersburg, a city in Montgomery County, Maryland. While he remains a popular figure in the UFO research community, he has chosen to keep his family away from the spotlight, which is understandable considering the scrutiny he faces day after day. The backlash he deals with has only increased following his inclusion in James Fox\u2019s \u2018The Program.\u2019 The recent reactions against Jason can be traced back to an interview he gave to Post Disclosure World, a YouTube channel dedicated to UFO news, in December 2024.\n\nWhen asked about his experiences as an Air Force officer, Jason alleged that he was forced to do some \u201cdirty work,\u201d which mainly involved killing \u201cNHI,\u201d also known as non-human intelligence. He went on to explain that he had to do it because he was informed that \u201cbad things\u201d would happen to him or his family if he didn\u2019t comply. The online UFO research community immensely scrutinized the whistleblower\u2019s \u201calien assassin\u201d claim. The credibility he garnered since his emergence as a first-hand witness of alleged alien existence was severely affected within a day. Even James Fox, who initially backed Jason, expressed his disbelief.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely devastates his credibility. But I still believe that encounter may have happened based on the background digging I did, but yeah, that\u2019s not good for his credibility,\u201d Fox shared. Irrespective of the backlash Jason continues to receive, he remains a sensational figure when it comes to alien discourse. Since April 2024, he has given numerous interviews and appeared on several podcasts to explain his claims. He is also one of the advocates of a comprehensive Congressional investigation into UAP within the jurisdiction of the US government. As \u2018The Program\u2019 sheds light on the possible existence of extraterrestrial beings, we can look forward to more clarity concerning Jason\u2019s credibility and his claims\u2019 authenticity.\n\nRead More: Lee Speigel Tribute on The Program: Who Was He?

            "article_content": "James Fox\u2019s documentary \u2018The Program\u2019 ends with a dedication to Lee Speigel. Lee was one of the most reputed and influential journalists who specialized in the UFO and paranormal study for over half a century. He grew up in Concord, New Hampshire, inspired by the Apollo space missions, which ignited his interest in UFOs and several other unexplainable phenomena. In the early 1970s, he found a second home in New York City, where he fed his interest in extraterrestrial life with whatever he could find on the subject. Lee\u2019s contributions to UFO research are not only exceptional but also unparalleled.\n\nLee Speigel Was a Pioneer UFO Researcher\n\nAfter establishing himself in New York City by the early 1970s, it didn\u2019t take long for Lee Speigel to leave an impression on his peers. His obsession with alleged UFO sightings and witness stories prepared him to conceive CBS\u2019 documentary record album \u2018UFOs: The Credibility Factor.\u2019 In 1978, he made his presence known in the world of extraterrestrial research by organizing the United Nations\u2019 first-ever meeting on UFOs. The participants of the conference ranged from military personnel to scientific experts, in addition to the UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. In the late 1970s, Lee collaborated with Richard Belzer to give birth and run \u2018Edge of Reality\u2019 for NBC Radio.\n\n\u2018Edge of Reality\u2019 gradually became a highlight of Lee\u2019s radio career. He produced around 1,500 hours of the program, which featured eminent figures such as \u2018Star Trek\u2019 stars Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner. During this period, his collaborations grew. Lee even interacted with Stephen Spielberg while the latter was developing \u2018Close Encounters of the Third Kind\u2019 and \u2018E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.\u2019 In addition to the filmmaker, the renowned journalist Robin Leach spent time with the UFO enthusiast, specifically to go for \u201cUFO hunting.\u201d In the late 1990s, a while after the conclusion of \u2018Edge of Reality,\u2019 Lee ended up in ABC Radio Networks.\n\nAfter a short stint at ABC News as a copy editor, Lee joined AOL News in 2010 to write about inexplicable phenomena. The freelance position was a precursor to his appointment as a full-time reporter of The Huffington Post, presently known as HuffPost, in 2011. It didn\u2019t take long for him to find his footing in his new workplace since he won the 2012 International UFO Congress Researcher of the Year Award. As the years passed, even though the workplaces changed, his focus remained the same. He delved deep into UFOs, this time with astronauts such as Edgar Mitchell, Alan Bean, and Leroy Chiao.\n\nLee Speigel Collaborated With James Fox and Several UFO Investigators\n\nIn his late years, Lee Speigel was as busy as ever with several commitments. He restarted hosting \u2018Edge of Reality\u2019 after reviving the radio show for UN-X Digital Broadcast Network. During his time at The Huffington Post, the topics he explored ranged from mythical creatures such as the yeti to the specifics of \u201calien sex.\u201d His remarkable articles were not the only things that left his colleagues in bewilderment. During an editorial meeting, he claimed to be committed to exposing a multinational conspiracy mounted to conceal a spacecraft\u2019s crash-landing. This example explains why Buck Wolf, the director of HuffPost Trends and one of Lee\u2019s longtime colleagues, saw him as a showman in the newsroom.\n\nFurthermore, James Fox didn\u2019t dedicate \u2018The Program\u2019 to Lee for no reason. The latter co-wrote and co-produced the filmmaker\u2019s 2020 documentary \u2018The Phenomenon,\u2019 which explores unidentified aerial phenomena through the words of high-ranking government officials. One of Lee\u2019s final assignments was assisting Marc Hartzman in writing \u2018We Are Not Alone,\u2019 a comprehensive investigation into UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence. In addition to these works, he is featured in several media productions such as History Channel\u2019s \u2018Unsealed: Alien Files,\u2019 H2\u2019s \u2018Hangar 1: The UFO Files,\u2019 and the TV movie \u2018UFO Coverups: Secrets Revealed.\u2019\n\nLee Speigel Passed Away at the Age of 74\n\nLee Speigel passed away in August 2023 at the age of 74 after battling esophageal cancer. He is survived by his wife, Lorraine Simone. Following his passing, the friends and family of the journalist were adamant about bidding adieu to him in a way that honored his life and contributions. They raised over $10,000 to send his cremated ashes into space with the help of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. \u201cAnyone who knew Lee knows he wanted to get into space somehow [\u2026]. I\u2019m sure Lee is somewhere enjoying all this immensely,\u201d Simone told HuffPost about the unexpected ceremony.\n\nThe SpaceX rocket with Lee\u2019s ashes was launched on March 4, 2024. Buck Wolf and Simone joined hands together to send their beloved one to the vastness and comfort of outer space with the money the former raised on behalf of the journalist\u2019s family and friends. In June 2024, Wolf confirmed that the deceased\u2019s cremated ashes were orbiting Earth. Lee\u2019s companions and loved ones also donated his enormous archive of interviews and case files to the National UFO Historical Records Center in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, so that the next generation of UFO enthusiasts could delve into the same.\n\nFollowing Lee\u2019s passing, many of his friends and collaborators remembered him fondly. Marc Hartzman identified him as the one who \u201copened doors no one else could\u201d to HuffPost, joining Race Hobbs, the journalist\u2019s UN-X producer who called him a \u201cgenius.\u201d Ultimately, Buck celebrated his life by describing him as a \u201cstargazer,\u201d \u201cdreamer,\u201d and a \u201ckind spirit\u201d who was loved by many. Lee joined the realm of stars after creating an unparalleled legacy in the field of UFO research and investigation, which makes his tribute on \u2018The Program\u2019 all the more fitting.\n\nRead More: Craig Lindsay: Where is the Retired RAF Officer Now?"

And small language models will also likely come into their own, addressing specific tasks without overburdening data center processing and power.\n\nOrganizations will also adopt new technologies and architectures to better govern data and AI, with a return to predictive AI, according to Forrester Research."

            "article_content": "The Mysterious Recording\n\n\n\nIs It Paranormal or a Real Intruder?\n\n\n\nTheories and Speculation: What Was the Voice Saying?\n\n\n\nA woman is now sleeping with one eye open after her sleep tracking app recorded an unsettling incident: a mysterious man's voice speaking to her while she slept. This bizarre experience has left her questioning the safety of her own home. Sleep talking is a common occurrence. A 2010 study from Norway revealed that as many as two in three people engage in some form of sleep talking. From mumbling to full conversations, it's a phenomenon that many have experienced. However, few have had the unsettling realization that an unknown voice might be talking back.This is exactly what happened to one Reddit user, who shared her unnerving story with the community. The woman posted a 10-second recording captured by the Sleepcycle app at 3:26 AM. The app flagged the moment as \u201ctalking,\u201d but what stood out was not her own voice\u2014there was a man\u2019s voice speaking in the recording. Incredibly clear, the male voice uttered sounds that appeared to be gibberish, such as \u201cwaka waka, baka baka,\u201d to which the woman responded with soft \u201cmmm\u201d and \u201cmmhm.\u201dThe woman speculated that the voice might be speaking in a different language, but despite using translation apps, she was unable to decode the strange words. \u201cThe voice is incredibly clear and seems to be talking to me and I\u2019m responding. I don\u2019t recognize the man\u2019s voice and I think I detect a bit of some kind of accent,\u201d she explained.Her concern grew as she recalled that she lives alone in a second-floor apartment, with deadbolt locks on her door and no other apparent means of entry. She wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is paranormal or ghost, to me it sounds like there was someone in my apartment, but I don\u2019t know how that would be possible.\u201dSearching for a logical explanation, the woman suggested that perhaps her devices might have been hacked, but she ruled it out as the technology in her living room was too far from her phone to pick up such a clear voice.The recording understandably \"freaked\" her out, and she wasn\u2019t the only one. Hundreds of Reddit users shared their own reactions to the bizarre clip, with many offering advice to protect her safety. One user suggested installing cameras in her apartment to check for a possible intruder, writing, \u201cI know it\u2019s horrifying and also rare, but it happens. I\u2019d rule that out ASAP. Safety first, and mundane before magic.\u201dOthers tried to decipher the mysterious words. Some suggested that \u201cwaka waka\u201d might be slang from Cameroon, meaning \u201cdo it,\u201d while \u201cbaka\u201d is a Japanese term for \u201cidiot.\u201d Reddit users speculated that the voice was telling the woman to \u201cdo something and not doing it would be stupid.\u201dDespite the attempts to understand the meaning, some found humor in the situation, joking that the \u201cpoltergeist\u201d might be singing Shakira\u2019s \u201cWaka Waka (This Time for Africa)\u201d or that Fozzie Bear from the Muppets had moved into her apartment.However, for most, the unsettling thought of an actual person invading her privacy was far scarier than the idea of a ghost."

            "article_content": "(Editor\u2019s note: Looking back on 2024, there were so many good albums released that we decided to reach out to some of today\u2019s artists and get them to weigh in on their favorites. What follows is Entheos vocalist Chaney Crabb\u2019s \u2018Top Albums of 2024\u2019.)\n\nMy name is Chaney Crabb and I am the vocalist of the band ENTHEOS. We released an EP this year on Metal Blade Records called An End to Everything and are looking forward to sharing a full album in 2025.\n\nJB Dunckel \u2013 Paranormal Musicality\n\nJB Dunckel\u2019s \u2018Paranormal Musicality\u2019 was my first favorite album of 2024. JB is one half of one of my favorite musical groups of all-time \u2013 AIR. Air\u2019s hauntingly enchanting and melancholy melodies have kept me a fan of every release I\u2019ve heard from them since their music first graced my ears in \u201cThe Virgin Suicides\u201d score, and JB\u2019s solo efforts are no different.\n\n\u2018Paranormal Musicality\u2019 is a piano-only album \u2013 there are no vocals and no accompanying instruments, but as every melodic line passes there\u2019s a sense that they\u2019ve always existed within our world. There\u2019s heavy emotion behind every keystroke of the piano. This is this album that ushered in every winter day for me at the start of 2024 \u2013 and I predict that it\u2019ll be the one I listen to the most to close out the year.\n\nKim Petras \u2013 Slut Pop Miami\n\nOne night over the summer as I was alone in my house, smoking a joint, and surfing through videos on YouTube I came across Kim Petras\u2019s lyric video for \u201cRim Job\u201d. I\u2019d heard a few Kim Petras tracks in the past but had never really taken a full dive into her work, but by the time the lyric video for \u201cRim Job\u201d was finished, I knew that I was a fully committed fan.\n\nFrom that point forward, \u2018Slut Pop Miami\u2019 became my summer go-to album. Its perfect blend of dancy, club hits with tongue-in-cheek lyrics and synthy, catchy lines is everything I want in a fun album to put on in a group setting. I can proudly say that I turned many of my friends and my band onto this album \u2013 we listened to it almost every day before we went on stage over the summer.\n\nMarilyn Manson \u2013 One Assassination Under God \u2013 Chapter One\n\nFrom the moment the first single from this album was released I had a feeling it would end up on my favorite albums of the year list. At this point I would say that this is the album I\u2019ve listened to more than anything else this year \u2013 songs like \u201cOne Assassination Under God\u201d and \u201cAs Sick As the Secrets Within\u201d are up there with my favorite Manson classics. The production is clear and perfect \u2013 Manson\u2019s voice is as good as its ever been and seeing the band live over the summer cemented that.\n\nChelsea Wolfe \u2013 She Reaches Out to She Reaches Out to She\n\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Chelsea Wolfe\u2019s for a while, and one thing that I love about her as an artist is that she\u2019s never afraid to explore different aspects of her own artistry and sound. \u2018She Reaches Out to She Reaches out to She\u2019 embraces the landscape of dark electronica to its fullest \u2013 one of my favorite parts of this album is the atmosphere of it \u2013 at moments its almost suffocating, but always with the outward breath of beauty and relief masterfully entwined in the darkness.\n\nThe Cure \u2013 Songs of A Lost World\n\nIt comes as a little bit of a surprise, even to myself, that I\u2019ve never been a huge fan of The Cure. It\u2019s not that I have never liked their music \u2013 it\u2019s that I\u2019ve never taken the time to familiarize myself with their entire discography. I can proudly say that this changed this year with the release of \u201cSongs of A Lost World\u201d. From the first lyrical line on the album \u201cThis is the end of every song that we sing\u201d I was completely entranced by the dark beauty of this album. The album feels to me like a deep, introspective look at death. I feel such a kinship to that lyrical matter and sense of darkness in this beautiful world."

            "article_content": "Probe the Probe\n\nThe family of Suchir Balaji, the 26-year-old OpenAI whistleblower who was found dead just a month after his New York Times expos\u00e9 was published, is claiming that the young man was murdered.\n\nAn account that appears to belong to Balaji's mother Poornima Ramarao \u2014 shortened to \"Rao\" online \u2014 said in a post on X-formerly-Twitter that a private investigator's probe has led the family to believe that the young whistleblower did not commit suicide as officials allege.\n\n\"We hired private investigator and did second autopsy to throw light on cause of death,\" Ramarao tweeted. \"Private autopsy doesn\u2019t confirm cause of death stated by police.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Suchir\u2019s apartment was ransacked,\" she continued, adding that there was some \"sign of struggle in the bathroom and looks like some one hit him in bathroom based on blood spots.\"\n\nThe account, which has shared photos of Balaji that hadn't previously been seen in the press and a GoFundMe for the private investigation efforts, went on to suggest that the city of San Francisco is covering up a \"cold blooded\" murder.\n\nAfter calling for an FBI investigation, the Rao account then tagged Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 and actually got a response from Musk himself.\n\n\"This doesn't seem like a suicide,\" the X owner and OpenAI cofounder wrote.\n\nPressing Matter\n\nIn the wake of Balaji's death, Ramarao has spoken out online and in the press about her son and her suspicions \u2014 though for the most part, her missives have not made waves stateside.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier in December, Business Insider published an interview with the grieving mother, who described her son's precocious interest in math and artificial intelligence, his disillusionment and ultimate exit from OpenAI, and the debacle she endured when trying to get answers about his death.\n\nAccording to Ramarao, Balaji had been on vacation with friends to celebrate his 26th birthday just before being found dead in his apartment. She claims she was the one to call the police when she hadn't heard from him upon his return from his trip, and that she waited outside the apartment for hours only to learn of Balaji's death when a medical examiner's van arrived on the scene with a stretcher.\n\n\"They didn't give the news to me,\" Ramarao told BI. \"I'm still sitting there thinking, 'My son is traveling. He's gone somewhere.' It's such a pathetic moment.\"\n\nOn X, Ramarao also claims that she was interviewed by ABC News on December 27, but that it \"has not been aired.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We wonder why American TV media is not picking up,\" she tweeted, \"despite... it being international sensation?\"\n\nIt's worth noting that Ramarao is not pointing fingers at OpenAI or any other organization or individual. Instead, she seems simply to want justice for her son \u2014 a just cause, if there ever was one.\n\nMore on Balaji: Dead OpenAI Whistleblower Had Been Named as Potential Witness in Lawsuit Against Employer"

            "article_content": "As committed chroniclers of the proverbial \u201cart world\u201d \u2014 an imperfect term denoting the ecosystem of artists, institutions, and other entities that make the visual art planet go \u2019round \u2014 we at Hyperallergic have noticed a few patterns emerge over the years. For example, why are museums getting so expensive? How come exhibition lighting is so offputting? And for God\u2019s sake, what\u2019s with all the soil art?!\n\nIn the spirit of ringing in the new year \u2014 and bidding adieu to 2024 \u2014 we\u2019ve compiled our Dos and Don\u2019ts for 2025, listing the trends and habits we\u2019d like to leave behind and those we\u2019d like to bring forward. Here\u2019s to another year navigating our strange, lovable, and deeply idiosyncratic art community (hopefully with fewer fair panels this time around \u2026 )\n\nIn 2025, Let\u2019s Leave Behind \u2026\n\n1. Soil Art \u2014 Since Walter De Maria\u2019s classic \u201cEarth Room\u201d (1977), soil has held a certain fascination and allure for art audiences, but now we\u2019re drowning in artworks that love to dig things up and prove to us how environmental they\u2019re being. All this has soiled our spirits on earthy works and we\u2019d prefer something else to make us feel grounded.\n\n2. Scrappy Ceramics by Artists Who Are Not Ceramicists \u2014 We\u2019ve all seen them, in hastily organized group shows and certain art fairs \u2014 shoddy ceramic \u201csculptures\u201d reminiscent of a last-minute middle school project you only remembered to tell your parents about the night before it was due. They\u2019re typically the work of artists with good intentions who want to experiment with the medium, but it\u2019s time to accept that this art form requires skill, and not everyone can (or should) take on the challenge.\n\n3. Abstruse Art Terms \u2014 \u201cThe artist\u2019s oeuvre of speculative futurisms is a catalyst for a praxis of rupture\u201d \u2014 did you feel your entire body cringe at that sentence? Let\u2019s treat contrived, obscure art terms like any other vice this new year: Everything in moderation. Don\u2019t get us started on crafty little parentheses within words, usually in service of saying two things at once that both mean nothing \u2014 \u201c(mis)understand,\u201d \u201c(re)imagine.\u201d It\u2019s not clever, it\u2019s just annoying.\n\n4. Little Gallery Books \u2014 Let us take a moment to consider the ecological disaster that is little gallery books. They\u2019re often small picture flipbooks with a short essay that someone hopefully got paid well to contribute to, but as anyone who has a bookshelf knows, those slim volumes are impossible to find. Not that anyone will ever read them.\n\n5. Gold Flakes \u2014 They\u2019re not good on cakes, so why would they be good in art? Believe us: The shinier the gold flakes, the cheaper the artwork looks. Wealthy collectors with abhorrent taste in art might cheer this unnecessary addition, but we prefer art that is rich at heart.\n\n6. Neon Text Art \u2014 It was cool back in the early aughts when everyone was into the academic critique of consumerism and mass advertising, but over the years we all caved in, gave up, and moved on. What good is your clever, post-modernish neon text if you\u2019re addicted to your phone, binge every piece of crap on Netflix, and ask ChatGPT to write your press releases? And does anyone even care?\n\n7. The Vessel \u2014 We were hoping for a permanent closure of the Hudson Yards Vessel when it shuttered for three years after four people jumped to their deaths from the structure, but no such luck. In October, the Manhattan eyesore reopened with prevention nets, despite public outcry. As Charley Burlock wrote for Hyperallergic, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the site has become a memorial rather than a public artwork.\n\n8. Unclear Opening Hours \u2014 Galleries and museums, for the love of all that is good: Clearly list your opening hours on your website and respect them. That seems obvious, yet art venues that boast values like access and inclusivity often ignore this most basic of principles. (On a related note: please make your websites user-friendly. If we have to click on an unlabeled floating object just to get to a list of current exhibitions, or your home page looks anything like Documenta 15\u2019s website, you\u2019re doing it wrong.)\n\n9. Pseudo-Academic Art Fair Panels \u2014 Hosting \u201cpanel discussions\u201d and similarly meaningless programming during an art fair is like putting a dress on a pig. No one wants to hear a group of \u201cthought leaders\u201d debate the politics of public art in the age of AI, or the relevance of biennials, or whatever. These talks are typically attended only by the speakers and their three friends who agree with them, perpetuating the art-world echo chamber effect we know all too well.\n\n10. Miserly Food Offerings at Openings \u2014 Nary a miniature croissant could be found at the press opening of the Whitney Biennial this year, to the chagrin of many of us who perused the bland artwork offerings on view with a grumbling stomach. No, we don\u2019t expect a three-course meal, but a small snack for a multiple-hour-long event is a nice gesture. And don\u2019t get us started on the increasingly microscopic wine pours at gallery openings.\n\n11. \u201cGallery-Spreading\u201d \u2014 Ever silently wrestle with some guy on the subway over leg space before resigning yourself to bumping up against him the whole ride? \u201cGallery-spreading\u201d \u2014 opening up multiple spaces with essentially the same function within just a few miles of each other \u2014 is the art world equivalent.\n\nNotice any odd titles in Philip Johnson\u2019s bookcase? (photo Valentina Di Liscia/Hyperallergic)\n\n12. Philip Johnson \u2014 Four years ago, when a group of architects and scholars exposed the architect\u2019s creepy racist and white supremacist views \u2014 and Harvard University removed his name from a building, and even the Museum of Modern Art, where he was the first director of the Architecture Department, agreed to cover up his name in an exhibition \u2014 we really thought Philip Johnson was dunzo. This year, however, The Glass House in Connecticut announced the complete restoration of his little \u201cBrick House\u201d on the property, complete with a reconstruction of Johnson\u2019s private library exhibiting a book simply titled \u201cHitler.\u201d Jfc.\n\n13. Expensive Museum Tickets \u2014 In the last two years, we\u2019ve seen ticket costs rise at several major museums across the United States, from MoMA to The Met to the Guggenheim to SFMOMA. Tempered by some positive initiatives like the Whitney\u2019s commitment to free admission for attendees 25 and under for the next three years, senior and student discounts, and other options, these price hikes are nevertheless an obstacle for low-income visitors.\n\n14. Art World Social Media \u201cInfluencers\u201d \u2014 With all due respect to your \u201cpersonal brand,\u201d we don\u2019t need your vapid hot takes on art, and don\u2019t have any time or energy to waste on your narcissism.\n\n15. Wishy-Washy Billboard Art \u2014 Let me guess: Your billboard project opens up a portal for discourse, community-building, and alternative futures. Does it really, though? Unless it offers a thoughtful message, isn\u2019t navel-gazing, and is situated in an area where people will actually see it and reflect on it, these billboards are less public art, more publicity.\n\nIn 2025, Let\u2019s Bring Forward \u2026\n\n1. Artists Putting Their Politics Into Action \u2014 This fall, author Jhumpa Lahiri turned down an award in protest of the Noguchi Museum\u2019s staff dress code banning the Arab and Palestinian headscarves known as keffiyehs, and earlier in the year, a group of anti-Zionists artists withdrew from a show at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco in a call for divestment from Israel. These were just a few of countless examples of cultural workers putting their money where their mouth is and holding institutions accountable. It takes integrity to pass up a career opportunity to stand up for what\u2019s right, and we commend those in our community who are speaking truth to power.\n\n2. Accessibility in Art Institutions \u2014 Canvases hung just a couple of inches lower to accommodate those in wheelchairs, better experiences for color-blind visitors, and fairs centered around artists with disabilities \u2014 we\u2019re starting to see some hints of the art world becoming more geared toward accessibility. Let it not be another fad, please.\n\n3. Better Food at Museums \u2014 There was a time when all we would expect at a museum restaurant or cafeteria was a dry ham and cheese sandwich or bad coffee, but nowadays we\u2019re finding that the options are better than ever. Whether it\u2019s Untitled at the Whitney Museum of American Art or the new caf\u00e9 at the Brooklyn Museum, it is feeling like we don\u2019t have to leave our culinary tastes at the door anymore, as there\u2019s sure to be something to enjoy if we need to take a break with a drink and food.\n\n4. Tribeca, a More Human-Scaled Art Neighborhood \u2014 We\u2019ve been dealing with the alienating galleries of Chelsea for too long, and now that Tribeca is slowly snatching the crown as the city\u2019s new gallery district, we\u2019re very relieved that there\u2019s a more human-scaled art neighborhood that allows you to wander dozens of art venues, while not feeling like you\u2019re trekking through an industrial wasteland. And if you thought the High Line park would help humanize Chelsea, I think you\u2019re wrong, as we have just added that one thing New Yorkers hate the most: feckless tourists who can\u2019t wait to tell you that their kid can paint that. Tribeca galleries give us hope that the art community is realizing that audiences want a different kind of art-viewing experience.\n\n5. A More Ethical Arts Journalism Ecosystem \u2014 So your show got a great review in Hyperallergic and you want to share it on social media \u2026 great! Just don\u2019t screenshot the whole article and upload it as an image on Instagram. Many people don\u2019t realize that online publications depend on readers and traffic, and posting our content in this way only benefits social media platforms. Instead, post a small snippet or image, if you\u2019d like, and direct your followers to a link they can click on to actually read the article on our site. Please share our stories as thoughtfully as we strive to write them.\n\n6. Thoughtful Exhibition Lighting \u2014 For a field that prioritizes visual experience, we sure spend a lot of time dodging light reflecting off an artwork\u2019s protective glass in order to, you know, actually look at the work. We see you, museums with anti-glare glass, and we appreciate you.\n\n7. Museums Unearthing Fascinating Collection Items \u2014 After languishing in storage for decades, if not longer, there\u2019s a new trend among collecting art institutions to showcase art that has not been allowed to shine in their galleries for ages, if ever. From the exhibition of Bhupen Khakhar\u2019s \u201cKali\u201d (1965) for the first time ever since it was purchased in 1967 by the Museum of Modern Art, or Thelma Johnson Street\u2019s \u201cRabbit Man\u201d (1941), which was purchased in 1942 but never shown \u2014 both of which are currently on display in MoMA\u2019s Vital Signs show \u2014 it\u2019s great to see museums figure out what they aren\u2019t doing right. As Shiva Balaghi outlined in her piece about MoMA\u2019s \u201cMuslim Ban\u201d show back in 2017, the reality is institutions are doing a poor job exhibiting their own collections, and when they do it is often much later, which robs audiences of important access to art that doesn\u2019t always fit into the institutional narratives.\n\n8. More Native Curators and Artists at Museums \u2014 There are more Indigenous curators and artists at museums than ever. In the last few years, artists as varied as Shelley Niro, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Jeremey Frey, Robert Houle, Nicholas Galanin, and many others have had retrospectives at major American museums, while artists like Kay WalkingStick have been exhibited at the New York Historical alongside their renown Hudson River School collection to explore the political realities that each body of work evokes. This is a trend we adore. More, please.\n\n9. More Local, Community-Based Art Shows \u2014 The year 2024 brought us an open-call exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum featuring more than 200 artists from the borough and a \u201csalon des refus\u00e9s\u201d at the Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition, presenting the work of hundreds of artists who submitted to the former and didn\u2019t get in. Meanwhile, at the Flushing Town Hall, over 70 Queens artists were included in the notably diverse World\u2019s Borough Exhibition. We love to see more opportunities for emerging artists to show locally, and for us residents to discover them.\n\n10. More Awareness of Age and Ageism \u2014 The art world has made some progress in recognizing the contribution of long-overlooked women and queer artists. On our end, we published a series of 23 interviews with queer elders throughout this year\u2019s Pride month. We must continue honoring those who pave the way for future generations.\n\n11. Being Open About Faith \u2014 There was a time when talking about religion in the art community was frowned upon. It was a strange taboo, considering so much classroom time in art history programs spent looking at Roman Catholic altarpieces, Early Christian manuscripts, Islamic architecture, or Buddhist or Hindu sculpture. But that unofficial ban seems to be lifting, and while some people like to think of contemporary art as a type of secular spiritualism, the art community is finally relaxing and allowing faith to be a bigger part of the conversation in arts institutions. Faith, like anything, is something we welcome as part of conversations. Back in 2003, our editor-in-chief remembers interviewing a Jewish-American artist who explained that he wasn\u2019t able to find a traditional gallery to exhibit Judaica. Has that changed today? Not fully, but it most certainly is changing.\n\n12. Museums Appointing Provenance Researchers \u2014 The Met Museum hired its first-ever head of Provenance Research this year, after a string of high-profile restitution scandals that led to government seizures of artworks believed to have been looted or otherwise improperly acquired. It\u2019s about time for institutions to have dedicated teams pursuing this work rather than relegating it to overwhelmed and underpaid curators.\n\n13. Playlists for Exhibitions \u2014 As interdisciplinary as the art world claims to be, how did it take so long for us to start incorporating music into the gallery-going experience? We think playlists add another dimension to viewing art, a personal touch, as evinced by the soundtrack Manny Vega curated for his exhibition Byzantine Bemb\u00e9 at the Museum of the City of New York this year.\n\n14. QR Codes \u2014 Let\u2019s face it, those printed press releases and checklists that galleries hand out always end up in the trash, wasting resources and polluting our precious planet. Art institutions that still don\u2019t use QR codes should join the trend. Your grandchildren will thank you.\n\n15. Audiobook Catalogs \u2014 While audiobooks are booming in the publishing industry, the field of art has yet to catch up on this trend \u2014 granted, this might be partly because so many artbooks are simply sales catalogues and not really supposed to be read, but that\u2019s another story. Earlier this month, I heard Duke University will be creating an audiobook version of Eunsong Kim\u2019s The Politics of Collecting book (check out our podcast with the author), and I hope it is part of a trend to allow us another way to engage with important volumes that we can listen to while we drive, cook, clean, go for a walk, or toil away in our studios. Audiobooks are great, and as someone who listens to them all the time, it would be great to have more art content to explore."

            "article_content": "VIRAL trends on TikTok produce a shedload of secretive slang, which can seem impossible to understand unless you're a regular on the platform.\n\nHere we take a look at the latest phrase taking the internet by storm \u2014 the \"Dior Bags\" phenomenon, which was coined by The Real Housewives of New York star Bethenny Frankel.\n\n3 Bethenny Frankel is behind the 'Dior Bags' TikTok trend Credit: TikTok\n\nWhat does Dior Bags mean on TikTok?\n\n\"Dior bags\" on TikTok is a code phrase used to discuss drones without triggering content moderation algorithms.\n\nIt was initiated by prominent TikToker Bethenny Frankel, who began using the term to continue conversations about recent drone sightings in states including New Jersey.\n\nShe shared information about UFO-like drones spotted over various locations throughout December 2024.\n\nHowever, the reality star noticed that her videos on this topic were receiving significantly fewer views than she expected.\n\nIn one clip Bethenny said she got \"only 500 views\" one some of her drone-related content, which made her suspicious.\n\nIt led her to believe that TikTok's algorithms could be limiting the visibility of content related to drones.\n\nTo get around this perceived censorship, which is also known as shadow-banning, Bethenny cleverly substituted the word \"drones\" with \"Dior bags\" in her content.\n\nThis code has allowed her and her following to continue discussing the controversial topic without risking video takedowns or account restrictions.\n\nTypes of Dior Bags\n\nBethenny has developed a specific terminology within this code:\n\n\"Worker bees\" : These refer to drones that are easily visible and can be photographed.\n\n: These refer to drones that are easily visible and can be photographed. \"Queen bees\": These are more advanced drones that are harder to spot, described as \"shiny\" and \"more special\".\n\nShe has also mentioned \"alien bags\", hinting at the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement or more advanced technologies.\n\nIn one of her TikToks, Bethenny explains that there \"are the bags that have been released, but there are bags that are decades more advanced that we haven\u2019t even seen\".\n\n3 Different types of 'Dior Bags include 'worker bees' and queen bees'\n\nSpread of the Trend\n\nThe Dior bags trend quickly gained traction on TikTok.\n\nWithin a short period, over 19,000 videos were uploaded using the hashtag #Diorbags.\n\nCommenters on drone-related content have also adopted the term, leaving those of us unfamiliar with the code confused about the seemingly sudden surge in discussions about luxury handbags.\n\nCensorship debate\n\nBethenny's use of this code phrase reflects a broader concern about potential censorship of discussions related to drone sightings.\n\nShe has expressed frustration at not being able to talk openly about the topic, stating: \"It's become clear... people do not want me discussing the Dior bags.\"\n\nThe trend has also sparked discussions about the nature of these drone sightings.\n\n3 'Dior Bags' is a codeword for drones Credit: Alamy\n\nBethenny claims to have cross-referenced information with people who have worked in known organizations and others who are aware of undisclosed operations.\n\nShe emphasizes the complexity of the situation, stating: \"There are many things going on at once, at the same time.\"\n\nKeeping discussion alive\n\nThe \"Dior bags\" trend is part of a larger phenomenon on TikTok where users create and adopt unique terminologies to discuss sensitive or controversial topics.\n\nKnown as \"Algospeak\", it allows users to navigate perceived content moderation systems and continue conversations that they believe might otherwise be suppressed.\n\nThe Dior bags trend has successfully kept the conversation about drones alive on TikTok.\n\nTikTok trends HERE are some more TikTok trends happening right now: Check out the Just Give Me My Money viral trend where each of a group of friends seeks a round of applause for saying the funny phrase. The October 1st viral trend has taken off and it has made the Halloween month the time to fall in love. Try out the Melissa McCarthy I Want Something dance trend. Ever wondered what Hopecore on TikTok was? Here's how to try out the AI hugging trend that's taken the social media by storm. One confusing trend is called the \"hear me out challenge\" that we've explained. Or do you want to know how to do the AI Disney Pixar trend on TikTok? A singing filter called 'Do Re Mi Filter' took the world by storm as well. The adorable Moo Deng has captured the hearts of millions, inspiring a TikTok makeup trend where fans strive to achieve a look reminiscent of this charming baby hippo. If you want to change your hair, the calico hair look trend is perfect for you. Another trend can either be an artsy activity or a date night disaster.\n\nIt has also highlighted the creative ways in which social media users adapt to perceived restrictions on free speech and information sharing.\n\nWhile TikTok has released statements about banning hate speech, there is no suggestion the platform is restricting views on content featuring drones.\n\nIn 2020, TikTok said: \u201cWe\u2019re proud that we have already taken steps to keep our community safe, for example, by not permitting content that denies the Holocaust and other violent tragedies.\n\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s always more we can do, which is why we are taking further action to remove misinformation and hurtful stereotypes about Jewish, Muslim and other communities.\n\n\u201cThis includes misinformation about notable Jewish individuals and families who are used as proxies to spread antisemitism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also removing content that is hurtful to the LGBTQ+ community by removing hateful ideas, including content that promotes conversion therapy and the idea that no one is born LGBTQ+.\u201d"

Additionally, Go overtook Node.js as the most popular language for automated API requests and GitHub Copilot saw significant growth.\n\nBefore presenting the key findings, David Belson, head of data insight at Cloudflare, explains why the company publishes the report and highlights its unique position in monitoring global internet traffic:\n\nCloudflare\u2019s network currently spans more than 330 cities in over 120 countries/regions, serving an average of over 63 million HTTP(S) requests per second for millions of Internet properties, in addition to handling over 42 million DNS requests per second on average. The resulting data generated by this usage, combined with data from other complementary Cloudflare tools, enables Radar to provide unique near-real time perspectives on the patterns and trends around security, traffic, performance, and usage that we observe across the Internet.\n\nThe report, organized into five sections - Traffic, Adoption & Usage, Connectivity, Security, and Email Security - covers the first 11 months of the year. Belson writes:\n\nThroughout the first half of 2024, worldwide Internet traffic growth appeared to be fairly limited, within a percent or two on either side of the baseline value through mid-August. However, at that time growth clearly began to accelerate, climbing consistently through the end of November, growing 17.2% for the year. This trend is similar to those also seen in 2023 and 2022.\n\nSource: Cloudflare blog\n\nAlthough approximately 70% of the world\u2019s population uses smartphones, mobile traffic is not surging. Mobile devices account for 41.3% of global traffic, a percentage consistent with previous years. However, in nearly 100 countries, the majority of internet traffic originates from mobile devices. These countries are primarily located in the Middle East, Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, and South/Central America. Among providers, Starlink experienced 3.3x growth.\n\nThe report includes information on the most popular search engines (Google), AI platforms (OpenAI), messaging services (WhatsApp), and e-commerce platforms (Amazon). The networking section emphasizes that nearly half of all web requests used HTTP/2, while 20.5% utilized HTTP/3. Additionally, 13.0% of TLS 1.3 traffic now employs post-quantum encryption, a topic recently covered on InfoQ in relation to both cloud and Java adoption.\n\nWhen evaluating language popularity, React, PHP, and jQuery are among the most widely used ones for building websites, while Go has surpassed Node.js as the most popular language for automated API requests. Cameron Balahan, Product Lead for Go at Google, comments:\n\nThis is a pretty big deal and corroborates the amazing growth we've seen elsewhere.\n\nThe report reveals that 20.7% of TCP connections are anomalous, unexpectedly terminating before any useful data is exchanged. This can result from DoS attacks, unusual client behavior, or third-party connection tampering. Alarmingly, Log4j vulnerabilities remain a persistent threat and continued to be actively targeted throughout 2024. Belson warns:\n\nIn 2024, three years after the initial Log4j disclosure, we found that Log4j remains an active threat. Log4j attack activity appeared to trend generally upwards across the year (...) Log4j ranges from approximately 4x to over 20x the activity seen for Atlassian Confluence Code Injection, and as much as 100x the aggregated activity seen for Authentication Bypass or Remote Code Injection vulnerabilities.\n\nIn a companion article covering the top Internet services across multiple industries, Cloudflare highlights the rise of GitHub Copilot in generative AI and the disappointing trends for Google Gemini and Hugging Face. Jo\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, senior data editor at Cloudflare, writes:\n\nGitHub Copilot experienced the fastest rise, entering the Top 10 in September (after reaching the Top 20 in June) and staying mostly between #5 and #3 by November. Some platforms lost ground in the rankings (...) Tabnine, another AI-powered coding assistant, held the #5 spot for months but slipped after July. Google Gemini (...) dropped out of the Top 10 after July as newer AI platforms gained momentum. Hugging Face mostly fluctuated (...) However, it fell out of the Top 10 by September.\n\nSource: Cloudflare blog\n\nThe Cloudflare Radar 2024 Year In Review microsite provides more detailed data, including trends for specific countries and regions."

partly through techniques within the classroom; and partly through the narratives attached to the sciences.\n\n'Specifically, the curriculum should offer children a chance to learn about historic Western and non-Western contributions to the sciences, as well as cutting-edge contemporary research from diverse teams of scientists.\n\n'Teachers should be encouraged to frame historic examples of scientific discoveries in the context that some individuals, groups, cultures and nations were disadvantaged in their ability to participate in or to resource research and less able to claim credit and ownership for ideas that had been developed by them.'\n\nThe Royal Society of Biology also said it had sought expertise on 'decolonising the curriculum' and for a 'no more heroes' approach to teaching science in schools.\n\nThis would mean 'avoiding prescriptive lists of historic figures in biology' and instead 'exploring opportunities for local, recogniseable, diverse historic and contemporary figures through which discovery and exploration of biological concepts can be explored'.\n\nIt added that students should be encouraged to 'see a wide range of biologists in action'.\n\nThe Institute for Physics suggested that 'ideas should be framed in the context of the times in which discoveries were made and accredited within Western science'.\n\nIts submission to the curriculum review added: 'They can explain how many of those discoveries drew on earlier work in other parts of the world.\n\n'And how, during the period of growth of Western science, different groups, cultures and nations were more or less able to participate in research, resource scientific activity, or claim credit and ownership for ideas.'\n\nThe Royal Statistical Society called for the greater use of 'real-world data' - such as on gender inequalities or migration - in the teaching of maths and statistics.\n\n'The curriculum should be focused on solving problems using data rather than answering questions about data,' its submission added.\n\nTeaching unions are also among groups to have submitted evidence to the curriculum review.\n\nThe Association of School and College Leaders said the current curriculum 'prioritises a somewhat monocultural worldview, especially with regards to literature and history'.\n\nMs Phillipson has hailed the review as an 'important step in this Government's mission to break down barriers to opportunity, deliver better life chances and enable more young people to get on'.\n\nThe review is being chaired by Professor Becky Francis, who has spearheaded research into educational inequalities.\n\nTory MP Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, said: 'Labour's curriculum changes will drive down educational standards.\n\n'Instead of continuing with a rich, knowledge-based curriculum which has led to our children being the best readers and mathematicians in the Western world, they are tearing it all up.\n\n'Pure education vandalism once again.'\n\nReform UK deputy leader Richard Tice hit out at 'a ludicrous proposal from the wokerati'.\n\nHe added: 'We need more historic British heroes and achievements to be taught to our children, not less.'"

            "article_content": "A collaborative effort between researchers at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences led to the deployment of a simulation code on a nuclear fusion collision model that has unlocked the physics behind supra-thermal ions in the burning plasma.\n\nThis helps us improve our understanding of how nuclear fusion reactions occur and how they can be improved.\n\nIn our bid to transition to clean energy, nuclear fusion is a critical component. Replicating reactions that power the Sun here on Earth could help us unlock boundless energy without emitting planet-warming gases. To reach there, we need to first succeed in getting more energy out of a nuclear fusion reactor than we put in.\n\nHumanity made some progress in this direction when the US's National Ignition Facility (NIF) achieved a net gain of 3.15 million Joules (MJ) of energy in December 2022. To make further advances, scientists are, however, focusing on another NIF milestone achieved in February of 2021 - burning plasma for the first time.\n\nWhat is burning plasma?\n\nIn NIF's approach to harnessing fusion energy, a fuel mix of deuterium and tritium (DT) undergoes implosion under reaction conditions similar to what exists in the stars. NIF refers to this approach as inertial confinement fusion (ICF).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn ICF, when deposited energy from alpha particles is more than required for achieving implosion, the reaction mix enters a burning state that amplifies energy densities in the plasma, also known as burning plasma.\n\nWhile this state can help us unlock fusion energy, it also provides us glimpses of the conditions of the early universe. Subsequent experiments at the NIF provided us with more information about these conditions but also brought discrepancies in neutron spectrum data to the fore.\n\nSupra thermal ions\n\nTraditionally, the behavior of particles in fusion environments has been based on Maxwell distributions. However, researchers found that this approach overlooked critical kinetic effects arising in non-equilibrium scenarios and does not explain the presence of supra-thermal ions.\n\nLeft: Initial temperature and density setup, which mirrors conditions of the stable and isobaric burning process. Middle: the ion scattering trajectories for large or small angles, and the boundaries of cross-sections at various impact parameters. Right: ions in large-angle collisions exchange substantial energies during a single collision, leading to supra-thermal ions defying Maxwellian distribution, while ions in small-angle collisions continuously lose energies during multiple collisions, resulting in an equilibrium or Maxwellian ion distribution. Image credit: Science China Press\n\nTo address this hurdle, a research team led by Jie Zhang at the Chinese Academy of Sciences proposed a novel model centered around large-angle collision dynamics, a revolutionary and multi-faceted approach.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEmploying a hybrid-particle-in-cell simulation code called LAPINS, the team conducted high-precision simulations of ICF-burning plasma to gain insights into the fusion reaction. They found that large-angle collisions promote ignition reaction by 10 picoseconds, which could help improve fusion reactions.\n\nThe simulation detected the presence of supra-thermal D ions with energies below the threshold of 34 keV. This is important since the energy deposition is twice that of alpha particles. The team also found that alpha particle densities at the center of the hotspot were enhanced by 24 percent.\n\nThe information gained from these experiments will help us fine-tune reaction conditions for fusion reactions and understand how high-energy densities impact plasma evolution. In the long run, this will help us gain more insights into the process of our universe expanding as well.\n\nThe research findings were published in the journal Science Bulletin."

            "article_content": "Part of being human is to create\u2014to invent objects and ideas that will make life possible, simple and enjoyable. Homo sapiens have been innovating for more than 300,000 years, ever since the first stone tools. But nature\u2014the iterative process of evolution\u2014is as old as life itself.\n\nNow, engineers sometimes look to other kinds of life for ways to improve our medicines and make our technology better. This year, for instance, inventors took a tip from jellyfish to create a non-toxic, fluorescent spray that can make fingerprints visible at a crime scene. Inspired by green fluorescent protein found in jellies, they created two dyes that bind to the negatively charged molecules in fingerprints and glow under a blacklight.\n\nIn another breakthrough, researchers built an ultra-sensitive microphone informed by spider silk, which vibrates with the subtle perturbations of sound waves moving through the air. By mimicking that strategy, the microphone can be made more compact than standard ones, which are instead designed after the human eardrum. Building on this invention, researchers said in May that spider silk could continue to revolutionize sound technology\u2014from helping to identify hearing loss early to picking up on low-frequency sounds known to precede tornadoes that might enable life-saving early warnings.\n\nBut before these advancements could come to be, scientists first needed to learn something about biology. In 2024, researchers tested the metabolism of fruit bats, analyzed the mechanics of swimming fish, and took note of the wound-healing abilities of both primates and ants. Each of these endeavors and others might open the door to developments in engineering or medicine down the line.\n\nHere are seven scientific discoveries from this year that could lead to new inventions in the future.\n\nSea creatures can merge their bodies together\n\nThe bizarre love life of the anglerfish | Surprising Science Watch on\n\nFinding love, for a male anglerfish, means looking for the bright lure\u2014or following the scent\u2014of a female, to whom he becomes fully devoted. And devotion, for the male anglerfish, means gripping on with his teeth to her underside until their bodies fuse together, his eyes fall into disuse, and their bloodstreams become one. The male loses his organs and becomes, essentially, a permanently affixed source of sperm for the female.\n\nThis bizarre love story is a mating strategy known as obligate sexual parasitism, and according to research published in Current Biology in June, it might have helped anglers to dominate the deep ocean.\n\nBetween 35 million and 50 million years ago, the ancestors of anglerfish evolved to lose their habit of \u201cwalking\u201d on modified fins in shallow water and instead shifted into the deep sea. This transition happened during a period of global warming that drove other organisms extinct\u2014and, according to the research, it happened at the same time that the anglerfish evolved sexual parasitism.\n\nGenetically speaking, two things needed to happen for the fish to have success with this mating strategy. For one, females had to become much larger than the males. Importantly, they also had to lower their immune defenses so that the female\u2019s body would not attack the tiny male as it joins to her.\n\nSuch a suppression of immunity is \u201ccrucially important\u201d to organ transplant procedures and skin grafting in humans, as Thomas Near, an evolutionary biologist at Yale University and a co-author of the study, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting area for future medical research.\u201d\n\nA similar feat is performed by comb jellies, primitive sea creatures distinct from jellyfish that are thought to have been the first lineage to break from the common ancestor of all animals on the evolutionary tree. A separate team of researchers reported in Current Biology in October that comb jellies, when injured, can merge their bodies together\u2014two heads, one nervous system.\n\nLike the anglerfish, fusing comb jellies might point scientists toward a mechanism that could prevent organ transplant rejection. Some experts, however, see potential in another direction\u2014studying how the creatures\u2019 neurons work together could shed light on nerve regeneration.\n\nMatabele ants produce antibiotics to heal injured nestmates\n\nLife for a Matabele ant is dangerous. The sub-Saharan ants exclusively feed on termites, but hunting their favored prey involves infiltrating the insects\u2019 colonies, which are heavily guarded. When Matabele ants go on the attack, about 20 percent of them might come away with injuries to their legs.\n\nIf those wounds become infected, it could be a death sentence. But the colonies have figured out how to heal their fighters: The ants generate antimicrobial secretions to prevent infection.\n\nIn a paper published in Nature Communications in late December 2023, researchers report that Matabele ants can distinguish between peers with infected and uninfected wounds, potentially due to a difference in the hydrocarbon profile of their exoskeletons. They\u2019ll target treatment on the individuals with infections, secreting a substance with more than 50 components boasting antimicrobial and other healing properties.\n\nIn a series of experiments, the team either separated injured ants from their colony or let the other insects attempt to heal the wounds. They found that injured ants isolated from their peers faced 90 percent mortality within 36 hours of the injury. But the Matabele ants under the care of their colonies saw only 22 percent mortality.\n\n\u201cWith the exception of humans, I know of no other living creature that can carry out such sophisticated medical wound treatments,\u201d says study co-author Erik Frank, an animal ecologist at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany, in a statement.\n\nThe ants\u2019 stunning medical abilities have the potential to help where human ones are falling short. For instance, several strains of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa infect humans and have evolved to resist many of our antibacterial treatments. The same bacteria infect Matabele ants, so researchers suggest something in the insects\u2019 secretions might help fight the pathogen in our own wounds.\n\nClams use the first known natural fiber optics\n\nNestled within heart-shaped shells, the soft body of a heart cockle dwells away from light. To get the nutrition it needs, the clam relies on photosynthetic algae that also live in the shell. But to give the algae access to sunlight without exposing the clam to harsh radiation, the heart cockle has developed the first known use of fiber optics in nature, according to research published in Nature Communications in November.\n\nHumans have been producing fiber-optic cables\u2014bundles of glass or plastic fibers that quickly transport light and enable the internet\u2014since the 1970s. But it turns out that the walnut-sized heart cockle \u201cwas way ahead of us\u201d in terms of fiber-optic innovation, per a statement about the discovery.\n\nScientists found that the clam\u2019s shell, made from a type of calcium carbonate called aragonite, is mostly built with plate-like structures. In between, however, are so-called windows, where the aragonite is instead stretched into hair-like fibers. These avenues transport red and blue light\u2014the best wavelengths for photosynthesis\u2014into the shell while blocking harmful ultraviolet radiation. In computer simulations, the researchers tried to find a more efficient structure by testing different sizes, shapes and orientations of the fibers, but they revealed that the clam\u2019s method was the optimal design.\n\nIn the future, engineers could mimic the mollusk\u2019s construction and create aragonite fiber-optic cables that might out-perform the ones we have today. These devices of tomorrow could rapidly transport information over long distances and revolutionize wireless communications. They might even allow for a key innovation: transmitting light without an expensive reflective coating on the cable, which is needed by the standard technology today, per Science News\u2019 Elie Dolgin.\n\nThe findings might also inform conservation work in the oceans. The clams, because of this innovative \u201csunblock,\u201d limit the UV light that could damage their DNA and that of the algae. As such, heart cockles tend to avoid bleaching in warmer waters, a phenomenon that affects both corals and other clams. Researchers say that using this fiber-optic technology could shield corals and their symbiotic algae in heating oceans.\n\n\u201cCan we maybe take inspiration from that to engineer new algae or new corals? A little bit more resilient, a little bit more robust?\u201d study lead author Dakota McCoy, an evolutionary biophysicist at the University of Chicago, says to NPR\u2019s Ari Daniel. After all, she adds to Science News, \u201cbillions of years of product design have gone into this.\u201d\n\nFruit bats have a special metabolism that prevents diabetes\n\nWhen humans consistently eat too much sugar, it can contribute to developing diabetes, a condition in which the body can\u2019t properly use insulin to regulate blood sugar. Worldwide, diabetes rates are expected to increase by 46 percent by 2045. But fruit bats don\u2019t have that problem\u2014they regularly eat twice their body weight in sugar-filled fruit each day without developing the autoimmune disease.\n\nTo understand why, researchers compared the DNA, kidneys and pancreas of Jamaican fruit bats, which have a diet high in sugar, and big brown bats, which have a high-protein diet of insects. They shared their results in Nature Communications in January.\n\nIn the fruit-eating bats, the pancreas contained more cells related to producing insulin and glucagon, hormones that regulate sugar. They found genetic changes that help the bats react to and process a vast amount of sugar. And the kidney, which filters waste from blood, helped the bats\u2019 bodies retain electrolytes. The organ had more cells meant to trap these salts, which resulted in fruit bats having more diluted, watery urine compared to big brown bats.\n\n\u201cEven small changes, to single letters of DNA, make this diet viable for fruit bats,\u201d Wei Gordon, co-lead author of the paper and a biologist at Menlo College, said in a statement. \u201cWe need to understand high-sugar metabolism like this to make progress helping the one in three Americans who are prediabetic.\u201d\n\nResearchers say the findings could help create a way for the human body to better detect insulin or sugar and react to it. But questions remain: Are other organs, such as the liver or small intestine, also involved in regulating sugar for Jamaican fruit bats? And can these findings apply to other kinds of bats, let alone humans?\n\nUsing the new knowledge to treat people with diabetes won\u2019t be immediate; it\u2019s \u201cvery much down the road,\u201d Gordon told NPR\u2019s Ari Daniel in August. But if researchers succeeded in finding an application to human health, \u201cthat would be the ultimate, \u2018Wow, we did it.\u2019\u201d\n\nFish swim in schools to save energy\n\nScientists have long understood that schooling together with their peers makes fish like the giant danio less vulnerable to predators. The coordinated expansions and contractions of the group could confuse a potential attacker and make any individual fish a less likely target. But researchers wondered whether schools serve another purpose, too: helping fish save energy.\n\nTo answer this question, researchers put giant danios on a type of treadmill for fish\u2014essentially, a closed loop for swimming that uses a propeller to create a current. As the fish moved against the flow, high-speed cameras captured their motions, and a probe measured how much oxygen they consumed, to reveal their energy expenditure. In some trials, the fish swam in a group; in others, they swam alone.\n\nThe findings, reported in PLOS Biology in June, showed that danios grouped in schools of eight used up to 79 percent less energy than the ones swimming solo. Essentially, like bikers in a peloton, the schooling fish could weather turbulence and save energy. No matter whether they were swimming in rough or calm waters, the school used the same amount of energy. A single fish had to increase its energy use by about 22 percent to maintain its speed against a current.\n\nUnderstanding these hydrodynamics could pave the way for advances in robotics. A fleet of flying drones, for instance, could follow the same principles to move together and save power. Or, possibly, swimming robots could take the shape of several schooling fish, rather than a single large one. Such devices might be able to tally fish populations or search for sources of pollution underwater, per Science News Explores\u2019 Andrea Tamayo.\n\nBut the findings could also have implications for fish themselves: As oceans warm, fish will have to expend more energy to swim and maintain their body temperature. So, taking note of their energy requirements when they move could help scientists to better predict how the animals will fare in a changing world. \u201cIn the face of climate change, we really want to understand things like [the energy needs] of fish,\u201d David Coughlin, a fish biologist at Widener University who was not involved in the study, told Science News Explores.\n\nTardigrades use extreme dehydration to withstand stress\n\nWhat can defeat a tardigrade? The eight-legged, microscopic animals are known for being nearly indestructible. They can bear the heat and pressure around deep-sea vents, endure temperatures just short of absolute zero and withstand several thousand times the radiation that would kill a human. The vacuum of outer space? Exploding out the barrel of a gun at nearly 2,000 miles per hour? Tardigrades can survive it. Even the five mass extinctions on our planet couldn\u2019t wipe them out.\n\nThese funny-looking creatures, also known as \u201cwater bears,\u201d can weather these extreme conditions by entering what\u2019s known as a tun state. They\u2019ll suspend their metabolism and eject 95 percent of their moisture, essentially shriveling into a dehydrated ball. In a paper published in PLOS One in January, scientists probed just how this hardy adaptation works.\n\nWhen researchers exposed tardigrades to the extreme cold, or things like sugar, salt or hydrogen peroxide, the animals began to produce free radicals, or oxygen atoms with an extra electron. As a result of their added charge, free radicals are very reactive and can destabilize DNA or proteins. Some scientists have even proposed that free radicals can lead to aging in humans and other creatures, though that idea is disputed.\n\nFree radicals in tardigrades react with a protein called cysteine, the team discovered, but when those reactions are blocked, tardigrades can\u2019t enter tun. Without cysteine, tardigrades also weren\u2019t able to survive freezing, even though they don\u2019t enter tun under that condition. This suggests the protein might play a larger role in the water bears\u2019 overall survivability. The findings might shed light on human aging or long-term space travel, or on dormant states such as cryptobiosis, researchers say.\n\nA second study, published in Protein Science in March, took this one step further and looked at how tardigrades endure tun. One of their tricks is to use what are known as known as cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble proteins, which form a gel that keeps the tardigrades\u2019 cells hydrated. Those researchers ejected the proteins into human cells and found they did the same thing\u2014made the cells more resistant to stress and slowed their metabolism.\n\nTo Silvia Sanchez-Martinez, lead author of the second study, this research doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re about to start preserving entire humans in an ultra-resilient, dehydrated state. Instead, she told Discover magazine\u2019s Cody Cottier, it might teach doctors how to pause tissue decay in organ transplant or trauma situations, such as in a war zone. Potentially, \u201cwe can stop or halt some of the injuries until we can address them properly,\u201d she said.\n\nChimpanzees use the forest as a pharmacy\n\nWhen chimpanzees are sick or wounded, research shows they might soothe themselves as humans do\u2014by seeking out medicines. But in their case, the primates use the forest as a pharmacy, seemingly picking and choosing leaves and woods with healing properties.\n\nIn a study published in PLOS One in June, researchers describe following two groups of chimpanzees in Uganda\u2019s Budongo Forest for eight months. They tracked what the animals ate, as well as whether or not they showed signs of illness, determined by checking for wounds and testing their urine and feces. The team zeroed in on a group of 13 plants eaten by the apes that had little nutritional value but carried antibacterial and anti-inflammatory benefits. In several cases, chimps with ailments went out of their way to look for these plants.\n\nScientists say this behavior could be a window into new drugs for humans. \u201cWe can\u2019t test [every plant] in these forests for their medicinal properties,\u201d says study lead author Elodie Freymann, a primatologist at the University of Oxford in England, to BBC News\u2019 Victoria Gill. \u201cSo why not test the plants that we have this information about\u2014plants the chimps are seeking out?\u201d\n\nIn another instance of self-medication, scientists recently witnessed an orangutan heal his own wound. In a paper published in May in Scientific Reports, researchers described the curious case of Rakus, a male Sumatran orangutan in Indonesia. The animal sustained a wound on his cheek, and just days later, he started chewing a plant called yellow root and rubbing its juices on the sore. The next day, he ate the plant\u2014even though yellow root typically makes up only 0.3 percent of the orangutans\u2019 diet. In less than a week, the wound closed, and it remained uninfected.\n\nBeyond potentially pointing humans toward discovering new natural remedies, the incident also suggests the ability to self-medicate originated long ago in the primate lineage. As study co-author Caroline Schuppli, a primatologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, told Nature News\u2019 Gayathri Vaidyanathan, \u201cit shows that orangutans and humans share knowledge.\u201d"

            "article_content": "If you\u2019ve ever had a doctor order a blood test for you, chances are that they ran a complete blood count, or CBC. One of the most common blood tests in the world, CBC tests are run billions of times each year to diagnose conditions and monitor patients\u2019 health.\n\nBut despite the test\u2019s ubiquity, the way clinicians interpret and use it in the clinic is often less precise than ideal. Currently, blood test readings are based on one-size-fits-all reference intervals that don\u2019t account for individual differences.\n\nI am a mathematician at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and my team studies ways to use computational tools to improve clinical blood testing. To develop better ways to capture individual patient definitions of \u201cnormal\u201d lab values, my colleagues and I in the Higgins Lab at Harvard Medical School examined 20 years of blood count tests from tens of thousands of patients from both the East and West coasts.\n\nIn our newly published research, we used machine learning to identify healthy blood count ranges for individual patients and predict their risk of future disease.\n\nClinical tests and complete blood counts\n\nMany people commonly think of clinical tests as purely diagnostic. For example, a COVID-19 or a pregnancy test comes back as either positive or negative, telling you whether you have a particular condition. However, most tests don\u2019t work this way. Instead, they measure a biological trait that your body continuously regulates up and down to stay within certain bounds.\n\nYour complete blood count is also a continuum. The CBC test creates a detailed profile of your blood cells \u2013 such as how many red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells are in your blood. These markers are used every day in nearly all areas of medicine.\n\nFor example, hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that allows your red blood cells to carry oxygen. If your hemoglobin levels are low, it might mean you are iron deficient.\n\nPlatelets are cells that help form blood clots and stop bleeding. If your platelet count is low, it may mean you have some internal bleeding and your body is using platelets to help form blood clots to plug the wound.\n\nWhite blood cells are part of your immune system. If your white cell count is high, it might mean you have an infection and your body is producing more of these cells to fight it off.\n\nNormal ranges and reference intervals\n\nBut this all raises the question: What actually counts as too high or too low on a blood test?\n\nTraditionally, clinicians determine what are called reference intervals by measuring a blood test in a range of healthy people. They usually take the middle 95% of these healthy values and call that \u201cnormal,\u201d with anything above or below being too low or high. These normal ranges are used nearly everywhere in medicine.\n\nBut reference intervals face a big challenge: What\u2019s normal for you may not be normal for someone else.\n\nNearly all blood count markers are heritable, meaning your genetics and environment determine much of what the healthy value for each marker would be for you.\n\nAt the population level, for example, a normal platelet count is approximately between 150 and 400 billion cells per liter of blood. But your body may want to maintain a platelet count of 200 \u2013 a value called your set point. This means your normal range might only be 150 to 250.\n\nDifferences between a patient\u2019s true normal range and the population-based reference interval can create problems for doctors. They may be less likely to diagnose a disease if your set point is far from a cutoff. Conversely, they may run unnecessary tests if your set point is too close to a cutoff.\n\nDefining what\u2019s normal for you\n\nLuckily, many patients get blood counts each year as part of routine checkups. Using machine learning models, my team and I were able to estimate blood count set points for over 50,000 patients based on their history of visits to the clinic. This allowed us to study how the body regulates these set points and to test whether we can build better ways of personalizing lab test readings.\n\nOver multiple decades, we found that individual normal ranges were about three times smaller than at the population level. For example, while the \u201cnormal\u201d range for the white blood cell count is around 4.0 to 11.0 billion cells per liter of blood, we found that most people\u2019s individual ranges were much narrower, more like 4.5 to 7, or 7.5 to 10. When we used these set points to interpret new test results, they helped improve diagnosis of diseases such as iron deficiency, chronic kidney disease and hypothyroidism. We could note when someone\u2019s result was outside their smaller personal range, potentially indicating an issue, even if the result was within the normal range for the population overall.\n\nThe set points themselves were strong indicators for future risk of developing a disease. For example, patients with high white blood cell set points were more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes in the future. They were also nearly twice as likely to die of any cause compared with similar patients with low white cell counts. Other blood count markers were also strong predictors of future disease and mortality risk.\n\nIn the future, doctors could potentially use set points to improve disease screening and how they interpret new test results. This is an exciting avenue for personalized medicine: to use your own medical history to define what exactly healthy means for you.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "article_content": "BENGALURU: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and University College London have developed a machine learning method to predict material properties using limited data. They believe this can aid in the discovery of materials with desired properties, such as semiconductors.\u201cIn recent years, materials engineers have turned to machine learning models to predict which types of materials can possess specific properties such as electronic band gaps, formation energies, and mechanical properties, in order to design new materials,\u201d IISc said.It added that, however, data on material properties \u2013 which is needed to train these models \u2013 is limited because testing materials is expensive and time-consuming. This prompted researchers led by Sai Gautam Gopalakrishnan, Assistant Professor at the Department of Materials Engineering, IISc, to work on addressing this challenge.In a new study, they found an efficient way to use a machine learning approach called transfer learning to predict the values of specific material properties.In transfer learning, a large model is first pre-trained on a large dataset and then fine-tuned to adapt to a smaller target dataset. \u201cIn this method, the model first learns to do a simple task like classifying images into, say, cats and non-cats, and is then trained for a specific task, like classifying images of tissues into those containing tumours and those not containing tumours for cancer diagnosis,\u201d Gopalakrishnan said.Their transfer learning-based model demonstrated superior performance compared to models trained from scratch, Reshma Devi, the study's lead author, said. The team\u2019s Multi-property Pre-Training (MPT) framework achieved remarkable results by simultaneously training on seven different bulk 3D material properties. Most notably, the model successfully predicted band gap values for 2D materials it never encountered during training.Looking ahead, the technology shows promise for battery development by predicting ion movement within electrodes. \u201cThis research could contribute significantly to India\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing initiatives by helping predict material defects,\u201d Gopalakrishnan said."

The country may not be out of the woods yet. Still, the economy has made a tremendous comeback, and the country has finally gained political stability through presidential and general elections.\n\n\n\nHowever, if history is any guide, every time Sri Lanka recorded a modest success, dark clouds of complacency set in and reversed the economic gains, leading to another period of economic stagnation. That eventuality is the primary challenge in 2025. More so, considering that the current Government in power, with its ideological leaning and campaign promises, is more susceptible to being the harbinger of that sense of complacency.\n\n\n\nDuring the first three quarters of 2024, the economy grew at a cumulative 5.2 per cent, and it may grow around 5 per cent for the whole year, a major turnaround from the two previous years of negative growth. The country exited bankruptcy, and the Rupee appreciated against USD by 10%. During the first ten months, the budget deficit was down by 31 per cent, and tax revenue went up by 34 per cent.\n\n\n\nOverall, the country has made a remarkable comeback from the nadir of economic collapse two years ago - though some folks are complaining on primetime television news about not having rice to cook Milk Rice to celebrate the dawn of the New Year.\n\n\n\nAlso on the political front, the Sri Lankans, disenchanted with the old guard, elected a president and a government from a party that had in the past led a violent insurgency to capture power -- without the elites or the military launching a countercoup as it generally happened in many parts of the world, most recently in Thailand.\n\nWhile the rationale of the electoral choice of the majority of Sri Lankans is yet to be tested, the very spirit of peaceful transfer of power at the end of competitive multi-party elections is something everyone could be proud of.\n\nThe current administration cannot take credit for either of the above achievements, but it could for sticking with the IMF program and not upsetting the economic recovery process.\n\n\n\nHowever, now that it is firmly in power and the economy is in a recovery mood, the new Government of JVP/NPP may opt to chart its own economic course this year.\n\n\n\nThe greatest macroeconomic danger to the economy this year would be the Government walking back on the economic reform agenda of its predecessor. That reform agenda may be unpopular among groups with vested interests, but it worked, hence the economic recovery. There are already signs of the Government walking back on plans to restructure loss-making and under-performing State Owned Enterprises. There are other mutually exclusive goals, such as increasing the productivity of the government sector while keeping its mammoth 1.4 million workforce intact. Such missions are practically untenable.\n\n\n\nThe lack of clarity on its economic policies would also exacerbate the problem. The emphasis on statism would also affect the investor outlook while rewarding the vested interest in loss-making state-owned enterprises.\n\nEven if the Government does not seek a complete reversal of the economic reform agenda, the reform process would lose momentum \u2013 that is not to say its predecessors of the Ranil Wickremesinghe administration was decidedly gung-ho in the process.\n\n\n\nThe Government itself faces its own dilemma this year. One of the most concerning would be how it could stay true to its manifesto, which is vague at best in the implementation of its policies \u2013 and placate a microscopic minority of its core supporters, whose economic views run counter to the economic reality.\n\n\n\nOne could see the same predicament in the President\u2019s India visit, where he said all the right things, which his predecessor had already told but failed to add anything new and substantial in harnessing India\u2019s economic success to leapfrog ours.\n\n\n\nHe should avoid the repetition in his visit to Beijing and seek to venture beyond what his predecessors have already done to expand the economic cooperation \u2013 as any forward-looking emerging economy would do.\n\nThough its political and economic orientation may be different, the challenge it faced is not unique to the JVP/NPP government. Successive Sri Lankan government policies were the biggest inter-generational drag on the country\u2019s economic prosperity.\n\n\n\nThe Government should avoid this eventuality. It could do so by setting the most generalizable measure of a country\u2019s economic performance- economic growth rate- as the gauge of its performance. That would also provide a way out of its ideological straight jacket and probably silence its fellow travellers.\n\n\n\nFor the moment, though, the government members seem to be busy in front of TV cameras, outing the crooks of the former Government. That is a spectacle in which the Yahapalanaya itself indulged, and it ended without a single successful conviction. When that fanfare was over, Yahapalanaya did not have anything tangible to show for the worth of its Government.\n\n\n\nThe JVP/NPP administration should also avoid that eventuality. The best course of action in the New Year would be alongside the corruption busting, which everyone loves to see; it should stick to the course of economic reforms \u2013 and venture beyond what its predecessor had already mapped out.\n\n\n\nHappy New Year 2025!"

            "article_content": "Save this picture! Today, data is primarily stored in large data centres across the globe, which are major energy guzzlers with significant environmental impact. Image \u00a9 Claudio Schwarz via Unsplash\n\nThis article is the winning entry of the Epistle Writing Prize 2024, an annual competition dedicated to recognizing outstanding writing on design, architecture, and the environment.\n\nWe might be in the age of the digital cloud - however celestial or ethereal it may appear to be - but it is not only incontrovertibly material but also a powerful ecological force. In present times, data centers are mammoth powerhouses of modern information, communication, and technology industries with giant servers that store and process data. While their proliferation is in a sense, a consequence of our consumption patterns, and as the global demand for the digital grows, so does the data center footprint.\n\nAs nations worldwide race to achieve data sovereignty, environmentalists and climate activists lament the destruction of land by the sheer magnitude of desolation that the data center engenders. What is evident is that these centers, as much as they stand tall as factory-like libraries, are integral laboratories for exploring what a sustainable digital future could take shape as. However, the question remains: can such a future truly be realized?\n\nToday, there are a reported 5,375 data centers in the United States, while Germany and the United Kingdom follow suit with 522 and 517 respectively. The rapid expansion of India's data center industry, driven by initiatives such as the broadband policy and the introduction of JIO and Unified Payment Interface (UPI), coupled with a user base exceeding 600 million smartphone users consuming an average of 26 GB per month, forecasts significant growth. India's 152 data centers are concentrated in the cities of Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, and Bengaluru. Estimates indicate that the market could reach $5 billion, with installed data center capacity projected to escalate from 800 MW in 2022 to 1700 MW by 2025. Acknowledging this surge, the Government of India unveiled a preliminary National Draft Data Center Policy in 2020. Various states have also implemented or planned data center policies, forging partnerships with private entities for facility development. Yet, these policies overlook a critical concern; their environmental impact.\n\nAt this juncture, the challenge lies not so much in designing for sustainability but in accommodating the unthinkable scale at which such infrastructure is needed and the repercussions of its abundant byproducts. This begs the question, are corporations hiding behind the mask of going green, marching forward with their data cantonments? What comes after the green building? Let's break it down.\n\nCarbon and the Cloud\n\nHeat is the waste product of computation, necessitating extensive use of power-guzzling air conditioning systems like computer room air conditioners (CRACs) or handlers (CRAHs) to mitigate thermal impact. To make cloud services accessible around the clock, facilities are designed to be hyper-redundant (if one system fails, another is ready to take its place), to prevent a disruption in user experience, further adding to energy consumption. In present times, annual energy usage in data centers reaches 200 terawatt hours (TWh), surpassing that of certain countries, reflecting their substantial environmental footprint.\n\nWhile major \"hyper-scale\" data centers operated by companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon are committed to achieving carbon neutrality through carbon offsetting and investment in renewable energy such as wind and solar power, smaller-scale data centers often lack the financial means and stability to pursue similar sustainability measures and manage fluctuating capacity requirements.\n\nLooking within the subcontinent, the state of affairs is bleak \u2013 with the draft National Data Center Policy encouraging the use of renewable energy but lacking in enforcement when it comes to specifying a mandate or threshold use of green energy.\n\nAn Era of Drought\n\nWater, a better connective agent than air for cooling, has encouraged the move to water instead of air for cooling to cut carbon emissions \u2013 yet it has significant drawbacks. In Bluffdale, Utah, residents face water shortages and power disruptions due to the Utah Data Center, which consumes seven million gallons of water daily. India, home to 17% of the global population, possesses only 4% of the world's freshwater resources. The country is grappling with water scarcity with nearly 21 major hubs including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, and Chennai dealing with severe water crises. The issue here is two-fold. First, neither the draft National Data Centre Policy nor any of the extant state policies address these water demands. Second, due to the unfathomable magnitude of such water consumption, statistics regarding data center water usage or its impact on the water table and communities have been left out of the picture.\n\nIn response to increasing awareness of glaring impacts on water-stressed communities, companies like Google among others, are pledging to go \"water-positive\" by 2030 \u2013 by optimizing water utilization and minimizing waste through recycling, as well as investing in water infrastructure for a water-secure future. However, the story is the same here; while corporate pledges such as these provide hope for a green future, they are not enforceable, nor do they appear to be feasible given the explosive growth of the cloud.\n\nA Millennia of Decay\n\nThe rapid turnover of computing and electrical components due to continuous technological advancements has resulted in a substantial increase in electronic waste. Cloud servers, with an average lifespan of only three years, require frequent disposal of outdated hardware. These disposal patterns further exacerbate the monumental increase in waste and have a hazardous impact on natural landscapes. Adding to this are security concerns with some companies demanding the destruction of server equipment to prevent the breach of sensitive data and information, negating the possibility of reusing components.\n\nIn vast manufacturing facilities located in the Global South, distinctive of low labor costs and minimal legal protections, smartphones are manufactured and distributed globally. Often discarded after mere months of use, their afterlife is destined to electronic waste sites, rife with toxic metals and radioactive elements that take over millennia to decay.\n\nPower and the Planet\n\nThe ecosystem of computational dynamics today has not entirely been shaped by the limits of design and technology, but rather by the stark inefficiencies of systematic thought and leadership that herald global interactions. As individuals, communities, corporations, and governments, we need to march forward toward creative pursuit through the lens of both efficiency and sufficiency. This requires a shift in our infrastructural configuration. Can we rethink and re-trace our steps to design circular patterns of consumption that tactfully address security concerns? Initiatives in Europe are paving the way for efficiency in equipment design that can prolong the lifespan of servers as well as ease the process of repair and recycling using material passports \u2013 that can document unit histories much like timestamps. Such efforts most definitely help us break immutable boundaries of what the cloud can materialize as and push us to herald in an ecologically sensitive and conscious digital age.\n\n'The Cloud Has Arrived, But What About Its Ecological Footprint?' by Amrita Khosla is the winning entry of the Epistle Writing Prize 2024 in Category 2: Break It Down.

But a few excavations made it into the field in 2024, and some of their discoveries are remarkable. Israel also sent some of its most treasured discoveries aboard\u2014a boon for many in the US who would like to see them.\n\nWhile the most important discoveries of this past year will not be known for years to come, these are the top stories about archaeological developments related to the land of the Bible, the biblical period, and the early history of Christianity that caught our attention in 2024.\n\n10. A new center in Jerusalem\n\nThe Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) opened its new center in Jerusalem after 14 years of construction. The Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel hasn\u2019t had a grand opening yet\u2014that may still be a year or two away. But the $106 million structure just down the hill from the Israel Museum began inviting the public to see the new archaeological discoveries.\n\nSign up for The Daily Briefing Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nArchitect and urban planner Moshe Safdie designed the building to resemble an excavation site. The entrance is covered by a canopy resembling those found at excavations all over Israel. As visitors descend, they see galleries, laboratories, films, and exhibits that display a small portion of the archaeological richness of the Holy Land.\n\n9. The Siege of Jerusalem\n\nThe Assyrian king Sennacherib \u201ccame down\u201d on Jerusalem in 701 BC \u201clike the wolf on the fold,\u201d with his armies \u201cgleaming in purple and gold,\u201d as famously described by the poet Byron. The king, for his part, ordered an inscription memorializing the feat, saying how he\u2019d shut up Hezekiah \u201clike a caged bird in his royal city.\u201d Sennacherib conveniently omitted the fact that he failed to actually take Jerusalem.\n\nThe site of that siege has been identified by archaeologist Stephen Compton using modern mapping techniques.\n\nCompton took a depiction of Sennacherib\u2019s camp from detailed relief panels excavated from Sennacherib\u2019s palace in Ninevah back in 1840, which are now on display at the British Museum. He superimposed that picture on aerial photos of a siege camp at Lachish, Judah\u2019s second largest city, which was conquered in 701 BC.\n\nCompton then looked around Jerusalem and found a similar layout at Ammunition Hill, now remembered as the site of fierce fighting in Israel\u2019s 1967 Six-Day War. It\u2019s a mile and a half north of Jerusalem\u2019s Damascus Gate. Perhaps someday an excavation will search for siege evidence from 701 BC.\n\nAlthough Jerusalem was not conquered by Sennacherib, the Assyrians exacted heavy tribute. Archaeologists also reported the excavation of an administrative center, near the new US Embassy in southern Jerusalem, that may have been used by the Assyrians to collect tribute. Researchers believe it was built on top of an older administrative center, built by King Hezekiah or his father Ahaz and razed by the invaders to demonstrate their authority. Excavation uncovered an array of personalized, stamped handles from storage jars.\n\n8. Skills of the ancient mariners\n\nThe IAA announced the discovery of the deepest and earliest shipwreck ever found in the Eastern Mediterranean. Previously, historians knew of only two Bronze Age shipwrecks in the region, both near the coast of Turkey. This discovery, 56 miles offshore, suggests ancient mariners were venturing far from shore, which would only be possible with well-developed celestial navigation skills.\n\n\u201cThis is a world-class, history-changing discovery,\u201d said Jacob Sharvit, head of the IAA\u2019s marine unit. \u201cThis reveals the ancient mariners\u2019 navigation skills\u2014capable of traversing the Mediterranean Sea without a line of sight to any coast.\u201d\n\nA natural gas company was surveying the sea floor with a submersible robot and came upon a huge pile of jugs a mile below the surface. A few of the jugs were raised to the surface and identified as Late Bronze Age Canaanite storage vessels from the 14th\u201313th century BC. The Canaanites later became known as seafaring Phoenicians and developed a trading network that ranged across the Mediterranean Sea during the Iron Age.\n\n7. A libation token\n\nClay seal impressions with images and letters on one flat side and perhaps the impression on the other are common in biblical archaeology. It\u2019s quite rare to find a blob of ancient clay that is pinched on one side with writing and an image on the reverse, but that\u2019s what a team at the Temple Mount Sifting Project found.\n\nThe discovery, made in 2011, was identified in 2024 as a pilgrim\u2019s token, which could be exchanged for an offering at the temple. The wine jar depicted on the token may indicate it was payment for wine to be poured out on the temple altar. The use of such tokens is described in the Mishna, the oral Jewish law compiled in the second century.\n\n6. Canaanite complex conundrums\n\nSome of the excavations that took place in 2024 explored Canaanite cult complexes dating to the Early Bronze Age, 1,000 years before Abraham, and to the Late Bronze Age, around the time of the Exodus.\n\nSalvage archaeologists preparing the way for urban expansion excavated a site near Beit Shemesh this year and found a building that had been used for ritual activity before being suddenly abandoned. Tiny cultic vessels, which probably had a symbolic purpose, were still intact.\n\nFew similar public buildings from the period have been found in Israel, and this site is helping archaeologists develop their understanding of early urbanization.\n\nAbout six miles south, another Canaanite cult complex has been uncovered at Tel Azekah. Archaeologists say it began as an open-air sanctuary with a spectacular view and was later enclosed. It was dubbed \u201cthe Temple of the Rising Sun.\u201d\n\nTen miles further south, the 14th season of excavation at Tel Burna ended after just three weeks because of the war, with some significant mysteries still unsolved. Archaeologists believe they discovered the part of the cultic complex where the priests lived, but they still don\u2019t know why the religious site appears to have strong cultural connections with Cyprus, which is located 300 miles away in the Mediterranean. And they don\u2019t know why such a large site\u2014perhaps the largest Canaanite cult complex of the Late Bronze Age\u2014was located so far from the coastal trade routes.\n\n\u201cHow did these hillbilly Canaanites build this cult complex?\u201d said Lipscomb University archaeologist Steven Ortiz, who joined the project in 2018, in an interview with CT.\n\nOngoing research at a mysterious mud-brick arch atop Tel Shimron in northern Israel uncovered a great quantity of Canaanite cultic objects. Next to the arch, in a depression that\u2019s called a favissa\u2014a place where sacrificial objects are discarded\u2014researchers found two bronze bull figurines, which are typically connected to the worship of El, the head of the Canaanite pantheon, or the storm god Baal. They also found 40,000 animal bones and 57,000 pottery shards, including remnants of a rare Minoan jug from Crete.\n\n\u201cIn terms of religion, we don\u2019t have anything like this,\u201d archaeologist Daniel Master said. \u201cThis is on a scale that we don\u2019t have anywhere else in this region.\u201d\n\n5. The gate of Shiloh\n\nWhen the Israelites lost the ark of the covenant to the Philistines, the priest Eli fell off his chair and broke his neck at the gate of Shiloh (1 Sam. 4:18). In 2024, the excavation by the Associates for Biblical Research at Tel Shiloh finished uncovering that gate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a niche in the fortification wall. We put a beam into that niche, and it goes right across the top of the pillars,\u201d excavation director Scott Stripling told Christianity Today.\n\nNear the pillars, archaeologists also found geometric paving stones forming a plaza, which is unexpected for that time.\n\nIn another area of the tel, or mound, excavators are uncovering the walls of a building the size of the biblical tabernacle, where the ark of the covenant was kept. They have also discovered a favissa with bones from sacrifices, pottery, and gold objects, which were apparently pendants.\n\n4. Redating a Jerusalem wall\n\nA wall once attributed to King Hezekiah is now thought to have been built earlier by King Uzziah. This indicates that Jerusalem was expanding even before a flood of refugees arrived after the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel in 732 BC.\n\nWhile that reassessment adds valuable insight into the history of the city, it\u2019s also a powerful example of what can be done with a creative combination of complementary technology to establish \u201cabsolute chronology.\u201d\n\nRadiocarbon dating, normally a boon to archaeology, doesn\u2019t work very well for objects made during the Iron Age, due to a cosmic phenomenon known as the Hallstatt Plateau. This has limited the precise dating of archaeological discoveries in Jerusalem during its time as capital of the united Kingdom of Israel and then Judah. For a decade, archaeologists have worked to combine radiocarbon results in four different excavation areas with a precise single-year timeline derived from dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.\n\nThis has led to several redatings, including the wall now attributed to King Uzziah.\n\n3. The start of the alphabet\n\nThe earliest use of alphabetic writing has been pushed back 500 years through the discovery of four small fingers of clay in a tomb at Umm el-Marra in northern Syria. The tomb, which contained burials in gold and silver, was discovered in 2004 and carbon-dated to 2400 BC, the Early Bronze Age, when Umm el-Marra was a crossroad of trade routes between Aleppo and the Euphrates River.\n\nJohns Hopkins University archaeologist Glenn Schwartz was positive about the dating but came slowly to the conclusion that he had found actual alphabetical writing. He went public with his conclusion at November\u2019s annual meeting of the American Society of Overseas Research.\n\n\u201cPreviously, scholars thought the alphabet was invented in or around Egypt sometime after 1900 BCE,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cBut our artifacts are older and from a different area on the map, suggesting the alphabet may have an entirely different origin story than we thought.\u201d\n\nNumerous references to writing in the Old Testament seem to indicate a level of literacy that archaeology has been slow to support. But recent developments, including the discovery that topped CT\u2019s 2022 archaeology list, are providing a fuller picture of early literacy.\n\n2. Jesus recognized in Germany\n\nA silver amulet was found in an 1,800-year-old burial outside Frankfurt in 2018. In 2024, researchers were able to scan the item, virtually unrolling the thin amulet to read the Latin inscription inside, which says the amulet will \u201cprotect the man who surrenders himself to the will of the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, since before Jesus Christ every knee bows: those in heaven, those on earth and those under the earth, and every tongue confesses.\u201d\n\nThis discovery, announced in December, provides the earliest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps, indicating that Christianity spread to Northern Europe more quickly than had been thought. The person who wore it was buried between the year 230 and 270 AD.\n\n1. A mosaic free from prison\n\nThe Megiddo Mosaic was discovered 20 years ago, but the amazing artifact, built for a small group of Christians who worshiped together about 200 years after the time of Jesus, was inaccessible behind prison walls. In 2024, it was loaned to the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC, and is now widely available for public viewing.\n\nThe mosaic floor includes three well-preserved inscriptions, and one, in Greek, mentions \u201cGod Jesus Christ,\u201d clearly testifying to the recognition of Jesus as more than a good teacher. The design shows the space was intentionally built for Christian worship. Centered on a Communion table, it more closely resembles a Jewish synagogue than the Roman basilica, and depicts two fish, the most popular Christian imagery before Constantine.\n\nThis is only the third church building that archaeologists have discovered that dates to the time before Constantine made Christianity legal in the Roman Empire. There is one at Dura-Europus in Syria and another at the location traditionally believed to be the apostle Peter\u2019s house in Capernaum. Those were both houses converted for worship.\n\nThis mosaic floor was not discovered at Tel Megiddo, a famous archaeological site, but a few miles down the road during the renovation of a prison. The mosaic will be on display at the Museum of the Bible until July. It will eventually return to Israel.\n\nThis is an unusually good time to see biblical archaeology in US museums. In addition to the Megiddo Mosaic, the IAA has a permanent display at the Museum of the Bible called People of the Land, and the IAA also has a traveling exhibit on the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is currently at the Reagan library in California.\n\nThe Tel Dan Stele, which includes the first known reference to the house of David, is on display at the Jewish Museum in New York City through January 5. And Discovering the World of Jesus, which includes the controversial James Ossuary with the inscription \u201cJames, the son of Joseph, the brother of Jesus,\u201d is on display in Atlanta.\n\nAn ivory comb from Tel Lachish with the earliest-known, full-sentence alphabetical inscription will be on display at the Lynn H. Wood Archaeological Museum in Tennessee beginning January 27. That was number 1 on our 2022 list.\n\nGordon Govier writes about biblical archaeology for Christianity Today, hosts the archaeology radio program The Book and The Spade, and is the editor of Artifax."

The thickness of the fog, its appearance under a flashlight, and the respiratory symptoms some have reported after exposure led many to theorize about chemical attacks, bioweapons testing, and, of course, aliens.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nSo far, there has been no confirmation that there is anything nefarious about any fog in any part of the world, but with mistrust in the government at high levels, this hasn\u2019t slowed the spread of frightened posting.\n\nNow everyone in TikTok is afraid of the fog pic.twitter.com/Trt4bOXEJN \u2014 UAE Exotic Falconry & Finance\ud80c\udd43 (@FalconryFinance) December 31, 2024\n\nWhat are the fog conspiracy theories?\n\nStarting on Dec. 29, social media users on conspiracy-heavy platforms like TikTok and X began publishing videos about a nefarious fog that seemed unusually thick or made of large particles. Some reported an odd smell described as chemical, electrical, or burning, and then claimed to experience fever, coughing, sore throat, headache, and fatigue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese symptoms drew COVID-19 comparisons and soon led to the term \u201cFogvid-24.\u201d As an echo of the conspiracy theories around the virus, some claim that government forces are surely deploying the fog as a means to spread a new pathogen, either as an experiment or an attack.\n\nReports from around the globe are surfacing of mysterious illnesses linked to encounters with so-called \u201cchemical fogs.\u201d\n\n\n\nDescribed as a thick, lingering blanket, the fog has left people sick\u2014many experiencing sudden cold or flu-like symptoms after only brief exposure.\n\n\n\nDubbed\u2026 pic.twitter.com/DQqnrsYKzd \u2014 Shadow of Ezra (@ShadowofEzra) December 30, 2024\n\n\u201cReports from around the globe are surfacing of mysterious illnesses linked to encounters with so-called \u2018chemical fogs,\u2019\u201d writes X account @ShadowofEzra. \u201cDescribed as a thick, lingering blanket, the fog has left people sick\u2014many experiencing sudden cold or flu-like symptoms after only brief exposure.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAround the globe\u201d may be an exaggeration, however. Most if not all of these reports appear to come from the U.K. (which is famous for its fog) or areas of the U.S., including Florida.\n\nFlorida, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, California, Texas and basically all over the country people are reporting this same thick \u201cparticle fog\u201d\n\n\n\nThey say it\u2019s making them feel sick, smells like chemicals and is not normal. What are the odds this exact same looking stuff is everywhere? pic.twitter.com/KMed4z4vBg \u2014 Wall Street Apes (@WallStreetApes) December 31, 2024\n\nSkeptics react\n\nConsidering how prolific they have become thanks to the internet, many users are quick to dismiss anything that smacks of a conspiracy theory. Theories on the fog are no exception, especially as believers and skeptics appear to fall along political lines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose reporting on the fog as though it\u2019s a government plot (or aliens) tend to lean conservative, with histories of anti-government posts or handles like \u201c@BGatesIsAPsycho.\u201d Skeptics, on the other hand, tend to lean left and are wasting no time insulting those who want to believe.\n\n\u201cThe delusional throbbers that believe this stupidity need to give their heads a massive wobble,\u201d writes @BSmithBenS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers have suggested that conspiracy theories like this demonstrate a need for traditional news media, heavy on fact-checking.\n\nWhat could explain the mysterious fog?\n\nAs the term \u201cthe fog\u201d trends on X, many posts come with videos of people shining flashlights into the mist, allowing viewers to see individual particles swirling around. This led to widespread alarm among those unaware that fog is actually made of small water or ice particles that reflect light.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA video from 2015 by a YouTube user testing out his LED flashlights shows the same effect. This is, in fact, how fog normally looks under concentrated light.\n\nAs for cold or flu-like symptoms, it\u2019s possible that people are simply catching COVID-19 or another common respiratory virus over the holidays. Some of those sounding the alarm say that the fog appeared on Christmas Day when they likely would have spent time indoors with a group of loved ones.\n\nEvery year since 2020, the late fall and early winter holidays have brought a spike in COVID cases, as has always been the same with contagious and seasonal respiratory illnesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtificial fog machine patent fuels conspiracy theories\n\nNot everything about these conspiracy theories can be easily explained away, including the reported chemical smells. Meanwhile, people keep digging up additional oddities that they connect to the fog.\n\nEarlier today, X user @girlymisogynist posted about a patent for a \u201cprocess and apparatus for the production of intense artificial clouds, fogs, or mists.\u201d However, inventors Paul Weiss and Jules Verdier submitted the patent application on Feb. 27, 1916, and it expired in 1937. So, it\u2019s probably not related to the current fog issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S. military bacteria fog experiments\n\nIn what sounds like a conspiracy theory but is reported as real by the Bay Area CBS News, the U.S. military conducted experiments over cities like San Francisco using artificial fog to spread bacteria from 1949 to 1969. They were meant to be simulations of \u201cgerm warfare\u201d attacks and allegedly sickened and even killed U.S. residents.\n\nThis is according to Director of the Terror Medicine and Security Program at Rutgers Medical School Leonard Cole in his 1989 book Clouds of Secrecy.\n\n\u201cNearly all of San Francisco received 500 particle minutes per liter,\u201d Cole wrote. \u201cIn other words, nearly every one of the 800,000 people in San Francisco exposed to the cloud at normal breathing rate (10 liters per minute) inhaled 5,000 or more particles per minute during the several hours that they remained airborne.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis report is based on \u201cgovernment records, courtroom testimony and interviews,\u201d according to Publishers Weekly.\n\nNone of this means that the government is pouring pathogens on its populace now, but we can\u2019t say it\u2019s impossible to do so.\n\nThe internet is chaotic\u2014but we\u2019ll break it down for you in one daily email.

            "article_content": "'What the f**k is that?' a young jackaroo on a remote cattle station asks the other three blokes riding rough in the tray of a HiLux ute.\n\n'Lindsay\u2026. that's a Min Min light! And if it catches up to us, we'll all disappear into the sky,' a rugged Indigenous stockman named William replied in terror.\n\nBaffled and confused, Lindsay turned and asked: 'What the hell is a Min Min light?'\n\nSince the dawn of man, every ancient civilisation has detailed strange sights in the sky.\n\nAncient Egyptians carved hieroglyphs of 'sky gods' into their monuments, the Romans reported seeing 'gleaming' lights above their cities at night, while Hindu mythology and the Bible mention glowing 'chariots' hovering among the clouds.\n\nAustralia also has its own version of UFOs - or Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) as they've now come to be known after a rebrand by NASA.\n\nAnd the first recorded encounters with 'conscious' glowing orbs unfolded in the 1870s, in the remote Queensland mining outpost of Min Min.\n\nSince then, it has become a hub for the strange phenomenon, with hundreds of documented sightings leading it to be dubbed Australia's Area 51.\n\nBoulia, population 230, is ground zero for the eerie phenomenon dubbed Min Min lights\n\nFootage shows an object purported to be a Min Min light spotted east of Boulia in November 2021 at about 10pm\n\nIn the year 2000, a Min Min light tourism centre even opened up there, welcoming thousands of visitors from across the world each year.\n\nResting on a lonely stretch of road between Boulia and Winton, in the central west of the Sunshine State, the tiny community sprang to life as the first commercial copper mines in the region were established in the 1860s.\n\n'The first recorded sightings were in 1879 at the Min Min pub,' Karen Savage, a tourism officer at the Min Min Encounter centre in Boulia, tells me.\n\n'But local Indigenous people say sightings go back as long as there have been people here.'\n\nThere are many differing beliefs surrounding Min Min lights, depending on what part of the country they appear.\n\nSome say the lights are there to guide lost travellers back home, while others fear the orbs lead wandering souls to their doom.\n\nMany also claim the lights appear out of nowhere, just to play tricks on them.\n\n'We don't know why this area has become a hub. But we do know that the prevalence of sightings here are far higher than the rest of Australia,' Ms Savage says.\n\nMin Min has become a hub for the strange phenomenon, with hundreds of documented sightings leading it to be dubbed Australia's Area 51\n\n'They can appear, disappear and reappear. It can be just one light or it can be multiple lights and while most of the sightings are white, there are also recorded sightings in various different colours - like green, blue, purple, yellow.\n\n'Local Indigenous people in the Boulia area mainly see them as a light that would guide them home.\n\n'In other areas, they see the lights as ancestral spirits in unrest - and dangerous.'\n\nThat's certainly the case for local Aboriginal people in the Barkly Tablelands region of the Northern Territory, where one of the country's largest cattle stations, Alroy Downs, is located.\n\nLindsay Pyne travelled to the area to work as a jackaroo in the mid 1990s, when he was just 17.\n\nFor many rough and ready country kids who had just left high school, it was a rite of passage to head to the Outback and muster cattle before settling on a trade.\n\nNowadays, the uniquely Australian custom has largely given way to gap-year Contiki tours overseas.\n\nKeen for adventure and unafraid of hard work, Lindsay fit in perfectly with the no-nonsense crew of stockmen.\n\nAmong them was an Aboriginal elder in a cowboy hat named William - who wore black stubbies and a blue singlet every day, with tattered R. M. Williams boots and no socks.\n\n'The bloke who owned the farm said he couldn't run the joint without William because he knew every square inch of the property - and being an elder, he just knew everything there was to know about the bush as well,' Lindsay tells me.\n\n'He took a shine to me and when we'd get sent off in groups of two or three, I'd often go with him and he would often tell me things about the dreamtime.'\n\nLindsay Pyne (pictured recently) once saw a Min Min light when he was working as a young jackeroo\n\nBecause the property was so large, the men would be camping away from the homestead about 50 per cent of the time.\n\nAccording to Lindsay, if they were more than 150km out, they would just set up camp, if it was less than that, they'd ride their horses back to the homestead or pile into a ute.\n\nOn this particular day, they were right on the boundary and it was getting dark.\n\nBut after a gruelling day's work, they decided to head back for a warm shower and comfy bed.\n\n'I was on the back of the ute with him and I looked over to the right and there it was - this weird white light - maybe the size of a soccer ball,' Lindsay recalls.\n\n'I thought it was the spotty of a roo shooter. But you've gotta understand, where it was coming from, there are no tracks. It's tufted grass, so you couldn't even ride a motorbike through there.\n\n'So there is no way someone was hunting out there or in a vehicle.'\n\nLindsay says he wasn't afraid - until he saw the look of horror on William's face.\n\n'He said to me, \"If the light comes we'll all disappear into the sky.\" He was hysterical,' Lindsay recounts.\n\n'Everyone looked up to him so we were more scared of it because of the way he was reacting to it. You gotta understand that this is the toughest guy you'd ever meet.'\n\nWilliam slammed on the roof of the twin cab and told the driver to gun it.\n\nWhile encounters and descriptions of Min Min lights vary considerably, one of the most common observations is that the orbs appear 'intelligent, conscious and curious'.\n\n'It sort of moves with you and always feels like it's getting closer. It started off the size of a soccer ball and then got bigger and bigger,' Lindsay says.\n\n'It kind of seemed like it wanted to follow us or something. It's hard to explain.'\n\nWhile encounters and descriptions of Min Min lights vary considerably, one of the most common observations is that the orbs appear 'intelligent, conscious and curious' (stock photo)\n\nDespite the enduring mystery, there are many possible scientific explanations for what could cause the phenomenon.\n\nOne theory is known as Fata Morgana - which takes its name from the Italian term for the Arthurian sorceress the Morgan Fairy, who was said to lure sailors to their deaths with bewitching lights, like fairy castles in the air.\n\nFata Morgana occurs when a layer of warm air rests over a layer of cooler air, causing light rays, from tens or even hundreds of kilometres away, to bend in a narrow band around the horizon.\n\nWhen these temperature inversions happen, it can often create a mirage or make objects appear distorted.\n\nA famous example of this is when ships can appear as though they are floating above the water.\n\nOthers believe sightings of Min Min lights are merely just lights from camp fires, far-off moving vehicles, aircraft or buildings.\n\nBut no definitive explanation has ever been proven.\n\nThe eerie inside story of Australia's most infamous UFO sighting: Witnesses threatened, a government cover-up and the official report so explosive it was destroyed after the death of its author\n\nBy Steve Jackson for Daily Mail Australia\n\nThere was no sound to begin with, just an eerie shape, looming in from the distance. Some say it looked like a giant silver cigar, others a flying saucer, a metallic disc, shimmering overhead.\n\nAs the craft slowed to a hover above Westall High School, the children in the playground started screaming. One of the eyewitnesses, Mary Eastwood, said it felt like 'the end of the world'. Students were running around, hysterical, or throwing themselves to the ground in panic. Mary and her friend sat on the perimeter fence, dumbstruck.\n\nThe only thing we know for sure almost 60 years later is that something strange and unnerving happened at the school, just south-east of Melbourne, on an April morning in 1966. Official efforts to dismiss the eye-witness reports by insisting the 'craft' was nothing more than a stray weather balloon have never quite succeeded and a secret government report into the incident has never been released.\n\nIndeed, that explosive report - authored by a high-ranking aviation official - is believed to rubbish the official explanation that the mysterious object was a high-altitude balloon.\n\nSo, it is no surprise that many of the people at Westall that day \u2013 students, teachers and residents of nearby Clayton South \u2013 resolutely believe what they saw was an alien spacecraft, a UFO. And now, even more astonishingly, a leading UFO investigator says what they actually encountered might have been a captured alien craft deployed as part of secret U.S. military tests.\n\nAuthor Ross Coulthart has spent decades investigating the Westall incident and is convinced the truth has been deliberately covered up.\n\nThe key to the mystery lies in the secret official report into Australia's most significant mass sighting of an unidentified craft which is still buried away in the bowels of the Department of Defence archives.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the document, it was compiled in 1967 by an engineer - known only as 'Mr X' - who was working as the Assistant Controller of the Aircraft, Guided Weapons and Electronics Supply Division of the government's now-defunct Department of Supply.\n\nLeading UFO investigator Ross Coulthart claims the truth about the Westall incident has been deliberately covered up, with a secret official report into Australia's most significant mass sighting still buried away in the bowels of the Department of Defence archives\n\nA purported photograph of the Westall UFO incident, in which almost 200 students, teachers and residents in south-east Melbourne claimed to have witnessed an unexplained flying object hovering near a suburban school before descending onto a nearby open field in 1966\n\nA newspaper clipping outlining what several witnesses saw on that fateful day in 1966\n\nCoulthart claims only two copies of the 'Westall Papers' were ever made. One was destroyed by Mr X's widow on his orders after his death, while the other remains hidden from public sight.\n\n'One of the things that happened in the wake of the Westall incident was that an official, who was very senior in Australian aviation, was retained by Defence to write an investigation into what took place that day,' Coulthart tells Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'He's since died... but I have spoken with the son of the man who wrote the report.\n\n'He says his father worked on the report in the family home and that he became aware as a child of the fact that his dad was travelling to the Westall school for three or four days in a row in what became an extraordinarily intense investigation.\n\n'And his father was so freaked out by what he discovered \u2013 the implications of what he learned \u2013 that he gave a secret copy of the Westall Papers to his wife and told her to keep it hidden away in a particular location in the family home.\n\n'He made her promise she would destroy it when he died but, essentially, that was his insurance policy.\n\n'Mr X's son doesn't know what was precisely revealed in that document, but he does have a strong recollection of his father's position on the Westall incident, and believes the truth went well beyond the simple spy balloon explanation.\n\n'He watched his mother burn the report in their back garden after his father died but there is another copy that was the filed with the Department of Supply.'\n\nCoulthart, a five-times Walkley Award-winning investigative journalist, says the mystery file was transferred to the Defence archives after the Department of Supply was dissolved in June 1974.\n\nINTELLIGENTLY CONTROLLED CRAFT\n\nAndrew Greenwood was a teacher at Westall High School when the unexplained incident occurred \u2013 and says he was later threatened into silence.\n\nHe vividly recalls a 'hysterical' student running into his Year 9 science class during first break, claiming there was a flying saucer in the sky. While dubious at first, Mr Greenwood nonetheless went outside and was shocked to see a bright silver object 'the size of a car' hovering in the air near the school.\n\nHe said the object began to slowly rise into the sky before it was approached by five aircraft. Whenever these aircraft drew close to the silver object, it quickly darted in a different direction before stopping again.\n\nThe cat-and-mouse encounter continued for about 20 minutes before the object landed briefly in a nearby field - known as the Grange Reserve - then shot away and vanished into the sky entirely.\n\nAndrew Greenwood, one of the teachers at Westall High School during the UFO encounter, has described a frightening visit he received from government officials demanding he keep quiet\n\nTerry Peck, who was a student at Westall, shows former 60 Minutes investigative reporter Ross Coulthart a series of drawings of what she saw hovering above her school in April 1966\n\nWithin 40 minutes, air force and army personnel poured into the area in military vehicles and formed a secure barrier around the reserve. But, knowing the area well, Mr Greenwood and dozens of students were able to sneak in and see what was going on.\n\n'[We saw a] circular area, like trampled grass,' Mr Greenwood says. 'And there were guards around it and there were people in there with equipment.'\n\nMr Greenwood remains convinced the object he witnessed was an alien aircraft.\n\n'I saw a craft. A mechanical object intelligently controlled hovering above me,' he told Coulthart in The Phenomenon, a documentary released in 2022.\n\nHe added that after discussing the incident with local news reporters, Mr Greenwood received an unexpected \u2013 and unwelcome \u2013 late-night visit at his home from two men claiming to be government officials.\n\nAccording to him, one was wearing plain clothes and the other a high-ranking air force uniform. They told him his recollection of the incident was incorrect - and he would be well advised to stop talking about the encounter.\n\n'When I tried to explain to them that they weren't there - I was - and I knew what I saw, well, the first suggestion was, 'You'd be ill-advised to go on saying that because clearly you were drunk on duty and will have to be reported to the education department and of course you will lose your job',' he says.\n\n'Absolutely, I was threatened. I was told that I should not say anything.'\n\nHe believes the intimidating visit was part of a government conspiracy to cover up the country's largest mass UFO encounter.\n\nEYEWITNESSES THREATENED\n\nOne oft-reported explanation for the Westall incident is that the object could have been a runaway high-altitude atmospheric balloon from the HIBAL program at Mildura Airport, about a six-hour drive away in Victoria's north-west.\n\nThe program was established by Australia's Department of Supply in conjunction with the US Atomic Energy Commission in 1960. It purportedly used white and silver high-altitude balloons to sample the levels of radioactive elements injected into the stratosphere by atomic experiments in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSome sceptics have suggested the object spotted hovering over the Westall school in 1966 was a runaway high-altitude atmospheric balloon from Mildura Airport about six hours away\n\nBut Coulthart - who has led investigations across ABC's Four Corners, Nine's 60 Minutes and Seven's Sunday Night flagship news and current affairs programs - is convinced there is a more sinister explanation.\n\n'Andrew's account is extraordinarily credible,' Coulthart tells Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'And he's adamant that what he saw was something anomalous that he couldn't explain away as a balloon or anything like that.\n\n'In fact, he says categorically that it was not a balloon of any kind whatsoever, that it was clearly some kind of craft.\n\n'He says he saw an elliptical, metallic disc-shaped object moving in some intelligent way.\n\n'And he's not the only one. There are well over 180 witnesses who saw the exact same thing - people like Terry Peck, who has a particularly vivid memory of what she saw, and who is equally adamant 'it was not a balloon'.\n\nPeck, a former student at Westall, provided Coulthart with a series of drawings of what she saw hovering above her school.\n\nRecounting that fateful April day, she claimed she jumped over the school fence and raced towards where the UFO had landed in the pines.\n\nBy the time she arrived, two other classmates were already there. One of them, a girl, was hysterical. Peck alleges the student was carried off in an ambulance and never came back to school.\n\nWhat happened next still troubles her.\n\n'We all got called to an assembly... and they told us all to keep quiet,' she says.\n\n'I know this sounds corny, but I know what I saw. It was not a balloon. It was a machine, a craft.'\n\n'I'd absolutely just like someone to come forward from the services just to say, \"Yes, it did happen, and it landed and there was a cover-up\".'\n\nCoulthart says he has since spoken to multiple people who attended the assembly who all shared the same story.\n\n'They all describe how there were officials from the government and people in uniform who were standing up the back of the hall who were listening to what was being said to the students,' he says.\n\nAnd it wasn't only the students being warned.\n\n'We've spoken to firemen who attended the incident, and numerous people who were told - threatened - that if they talked about this, this was a national security issue, and that they should shut up about it,' Coulthart says.\n\nFive-time Walkley Award-winning journalist Ross Coulthart vows he will continue investigating the 'non-human technology' involved in encounters such as the Westall mass sighting despite ongoing attempts to discredit anyone who speaks out about the 'biggest story in history'\n\n'Moreover, when the recovery operation happened, there were American-accented personnel driving American left-hand-drive jeeps.\n\n'So, it's just absurd to try to patronise these witnesses by saying, 'You don't know what you saw, it was just a spy or weather balloon'. That's bollocks, absolute rubbish.'\n\nPUBLIC LEFT IN DARK\n\nCoulthart has spent years pushing for the Westall Papers to be made public, but fears they may remain locked away in the Defence Department forever. In the absence of the full report, he has been able to assemble only tantalising pieces of the jigsaw.\n\n'Certainly, there was detailed analysis that was done: soils removed, there were radiation detectors used, Geiger counters used,' Coulthart says.\n\n'It was the most extraordinarily intense investigation and the public has been completely left in the dark.\n\n'I suspect there was a finding [in the Westall Papers] that the object was American technology. I am convinced the Americans have been using Australia as a secret location for testing of technology - non-human technology - that became too sensitive to test in places like Area 51, the Nevada Test Range.\n\n'There's been an ongoing Cold War between the Russians, the Chinese and the Americans over who gets access to this retrieved, non-human technology - and fighting for the knowledge of how to use it and how to develop and replicate it.\n\n'We've moved beyond the argument about whether these things are real. It's been formally admitted that they're real.\n\n'What we have now is a continuing attempt at a feeble cover-up by the Pentagon and the intelligence community, which, I suspect, believes that it can derive some kind of hegemonical American military advantage from the technology that it is hiding.\n\n'That is why the public is being lied to about incidents like Westall, and why this is being concealed.'\n\nTHE ROAD AHEAD\n\nThe Westall sighting has become one of the most enduring of Australian mysteries.\n\nThe incident has not only featured in a raft of popular documentaries, but has also been commemorated at the site itself with a UFO-themed playground.\n\nHIBAL balloons were used to sample the levels of radioactive elements in the atmosphere\n\nOfficially, the Department of Defence will not comment on the existence of the Westall Papers and critics continue to dismiss Coulthart's work. However, the investigator says that despite the passage of time, he will continue to push for the release of Mr X's secret report.\n\n'I have been vilified and attacked for investigating the technology involved in these kinds of encounters,' he tells me.\n\n'Numerous people I have spoken to have told me it is routine for people who are working inside this secret program to be intimidated and threatened with death if they reveal what they know.\n\n'But there is no amount of intimidation or bullying or threats that will stop me from investigating this. It's too far down the track.\n\n'This is the biggest story in human history, and I know it's real.'"

partly through techniques within the classroom; and partly through the narratives attached to the sciences.\n\n'Specifically, the curriculum should offer children a chance to learn about historic Western and non-Western contributions to the sciences, as well as cutting-edge contemporary research from diverse teams of scientists.\n\n'Teachers should be encouraged to frame historic examples of scientific discoveries in the context that some individuals, groups, cultures and nations were disadvantaged in their ability to participate in or to resource research and less able to claim credit and ownership for ideas that had been developed by them.'\n\nThe Royal Society of Biology also said it had sought expertise on 'decolonising the curriculum' and for a 'no more heroes' approach to teaching science in schools.\n\nThis would mean 'avoiding prescriptive lists of historic figures in biology' and instead 'exploring opportunities for local, recogniseable, diverse historic and contemporary figures through which discovery and exploration of biological concepts can be explored'.\n\nIt added that students should be encouraged to 'see a wide range of biologists in action'.\n\nThe Institute for Physics suggested that 'ideas should be framed in the context of the times in which discoveries were made and accredited within Western science'.\n\nIts submission to the curriculum review added: 'They can explain how many of those discoveries drew on earlier work in other parts of the world.\n\n'And how, during the period of growth of Western science, different groups, cultures and nations were more or less able to participate in research, resource scientific activity, or claim credit and ownership for ideas.'\n\nThe Royal Statistical Society called for the greater use of 'real-world data' - such as on gender inequalities or migration - in the teaching of maths and statistics.\n\n'The curriculum should be focused on solving problems using data rather than answering questions about data,' its submission added.\n\nTeaching unions are also among groups to have submitted evidence to the curriculum review.\n\nThe Association of School and College Leaders said the current curriculum 'prioritises a somewhat monocultural worldview, especially with regards to literature and history'.\n\nMs Phillipson has hailed the review as an 'important step in this Government's mission to break down barriers to opportunity, deliver better life chances and enable more young people to get on'.\n\nThe review is being chaired by Professor Becky Francis, who has spearheaded research into educational inequalities.\n\nTory MP Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, said: 'Labour's curriculum changes will drive down educational standards.\n\n'Instead of continuing with a rich, knowledge-based curriculum which has led to our children being the best readers and mathematicians in the Western world, they are tearing it all up.\n\n'Pure education vandalism once again.'\n\nReform UK deputy leader Richard Tice hit out at 'a ludicrous proposal from the wokerati'.\n\nHe added: 'We need more historic British heroes and achievements to be taught to our children, not less.'"

            "article_content": "Within our comfortable world of causality we expect that reactions always follow an action and not vice versa. This why the recent chatter in the media about researchers having discovered \u2018negative time\u2019 with photons being emitted before the sample being hit by source photons created such a stir. Did these researchers truly just crack our fundamental concepts of (quantum) physics wide open? As it turns out, not really.\n\nMuch of the confusion stems from the fact that photons aren\u2019t little marbles that bounce around the place, but are an expression of (electromagnetic) energy. This means that their resulting interaction with matter (i.e. groupings of atoms) is significantly more complicated, often resulting in the photonic energy getting absorbed by an atom, boosting the energy state of its electron(s) before possibly being re-emitted as the excited electrons decay into a lower orbit.\n\nThis dwell time before re-emission is what is confusing to many, as in our classical understanding we\u2019d expect this to be a very deterministic process, while in a quantum world it most decidedly is not.\n\nThis is highlighted in the Scientific American article on the subject as well, specifically quantum probability. Within this system, it\u2019s possible that there can be re-emissions before the atomic excitation has fully ceased. It was this original 2022 finding that was recently retested, with the findings confirmed.\n\nAs confusing as this all may sound, the authors of the recent paper stress that the core of the issue here is the so-called \u2018group delay\u2019 of the original pulse as it excites the cloud of rubidium atoms. If one were to think of this pulse as discrete quanta of photon particles, it\u2019d seem to break causality, but as a wave function within quantum physics this is perfectly acceptable. Observations such as the rubidium atoms becoming excited despite photons passing through the cloud, and emitting a photon before the electrons returned to their ground state do not seem to make sense, but here we also have to consider how and what we are measuring.\n\nThe short version is that causality remains unbroken, and the world of quantum physics is intuitive in its own, strange ways. Research like this also gives us a much better fundamental understanding of photonics and related fields, none of which involve time travel.\n\nExperimental setup and measured optical depth.
