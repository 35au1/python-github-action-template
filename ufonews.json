            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nOver a span of several days last week, multiple sightings of UFOs were made in the Fresno, California area with no explanation ever revealed. A couple of the UFO sightings were even reported to the local airport tower by pilots.\n\nThe first UFO sighting occurred early in the morning when a light was recorded in the sky by a news tower camera just after 4 a.m. Fox 26 News reported that \u201cthe light appeared to hover over downtown Fresno.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you see that object move at the clip it moves and it\u2019s hovering again,\u201d said Earl Grey Anderson from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), who reviewed the footage. \u201cThat one I would probably actually give an unknown classification to which is a UFO.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I thought was very interesting about the second video is the clip. It suddenly moves. I\u2019m not sure what distance we\u2019re looking at there. It wasn\u2019t light speed or anything like that but that was awfully fast. You\u2019ve got an interesting capture there somebody saw what I would technically call a UFO.\u201d\n\nThe day after the initial UFO sighting, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara captured video of another UFO in the time, this time in broad daylight.\n\nThree days later, during the afternoon, a private pilot radioed the Fresno airport tower with a report of something unidentified in the sky. A second pilot reported an object following him at 3,500 feet.\n\nTower: \u201cYou saw something over downtown at 3,500?\u201d Pilot: \u201cCorrect. It looked like a white object.\u201d Tower: \u201cHow long was this?\u201d Pilot: \u201cI just lost it right now.\u201d\n\nSeveral other people in the area also reported taking video of similar objects in the sky at the time. Jeanette Herrera of Fresno reported seeing it on back-to-back days, and it\u2019s not the first time she has seen UFOs over the city.\n\n\u201cI saw that one video of the orb and I was like\u2026 well, wait a second. I\u2019ve got good video of these things,\u201d said Herrera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve filmed that particular orb at least three or four times in the last two weeks,\u201d Herrera continued, \u201cIt almost does this like firework thing where it blows up and then reappears in a different area. So, it just does that constantly and then sometimes it won\u2019t. It\u2019ll just stay like a little solid looking orb.\u201d\n\nA Fresno police helicopter, which investigated the one of the pilot\u2019s reports, and efforts to reach the Federal Aviation Administration in Fresno both proved fruitless for providing an explanation for the mysterious UFO sightings."

Now, these mysterious phenomena are moving out of the shadows and into the light, as NASA pledges to study them scientifically. So, what exactly does science have to say on the matter?\n\nThis new NOVA investigation looks at the evidence from every angle, marshaling expert opinions from physicists, engineers, cosmologists, and others who are bringing new technologies and heightened rigor to solving these mysteries. How can new ground-based sensors and crowdsourcing of data help explain what military pilots and others have seen? Many of these sightings can be attributed to physical objects like balloons or drones, weather phenomena, or optical illusions, but others so far remain mysterious. What other potential explanations remain? Could they be the result of secret new technologies developed by other governments \u2014 or our own? And what would it take for alien engineers to traverse vast distances to send probes or visit Earth from other solar systems?\n\nFilmmaker Quote:\n\n\u201cWe are living in an age of conspiracy, and we need facts now more than ever,\u201d said Producer, Director and Writer Terri Randall. \u201cThis film is able to address some of the viewer's most urgent questions about UFOs from a scientific perspective. There is so much taboo and confusion surrounding the topic, and while there is still so much we don\u2019t know, science can help us say, \u2018this might not be as scary as we think.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe public fascination with UFOs began to grow after pilot Kenneth Arnold spotted something strange as he flew near Mount Rainier, WA in 1947. He described objects glinting off the sun and moving as if they were skipping off of water, and hence the term flying saucer was coined. This famed sighting, along with many others, ignited public interest with more and more sightings being reported. During this post-World War II period, military technology was also developing at a rapid pace \u2014 often in secret \u2014 which could account for some of the bizarre objects people were seeing in the sky, including the infamous military balloon crash in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.\n\nSince this balloon\u2019s technology was top secret at the time, the U.S. Army announced that it was just a conventional weather balloon. But the public didn\u2019t buy that explanation, and the government\u2019s lack of answers created a void, which Hollywood saw as an opportunity, and entertainment featuring flying saucers and dramatic alien invasions proliferated.\n\nBehind the scenes, the military continued to investigate these phenomena. In 1969 the Air Force ended Project Blue Book, which documented investigations of more than 12,000 UFO sightings with 701 of the cases remaining unidentified. But for scientists, not being able to explain so much of the data findings is unacceptable, which along with the pop culture hysteria around UFOs created an environment where the scientific community did not want to touch the topic. Because of this enduring stigma, NASA now refers to UFOs as UAPs: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena.\n\n\u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d features firsthand accounts from former Lt. US Navy and F/A-18F pilot Ryan Graves, whose squadron witnessed the famed \u201cGimbal\u201d \u2014 the first UAP video to be declassified by the Department of Defense \u2014 aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida in 2015. Graves was also the first active-duty military pilot to come forward about regular sightings of UFOs.\n\nThe film also introduces viewers to the U.S. Naval Officer and F/A-18F pilot Alex Dietrich, who in 2004 as a young aviator in training, witnessed what is considered to be one of the most important UAP encounters known as the USS Nimitz-Tic-Tac. Videos of both of these encounters were finally released to the public in 2017 when The New York Times published a landmark article on UAPs. It created a massive media frenzy which captured the attention of members of Congress who began to demand transparency. The science community took notice as well, but scientific investigation demands evidence \u2014 presenting a myriad of obstacles in this regard.\n\nWATCH: Navy pilot describes encounter with 'Tic Tac' shaped unidentified flying object\n\n\u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d features interviews with several of the distinguished scientists that NASA brought together to examine the UFO mystery:\n\n\n\nThe film documents an experiment from Semester and Kirkpatrick examining how the elusive nature of infrared light could be the key to solving the mystery of why some UAPs seem to appear and then disappear in these viral videos captured by military pilots.\n\n\u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d goes on to examine why the US government continued to be so elusive about rumored UFO sightings for many decades. It turned out that the debris a rancher found in Roswell, New Mexico back in 1947 was part of a classified program called Project Mogul where the Air Force launched balloons with sensors that could measure vibrations in order to monitor Russian nuclear testing.\n\nIt took half a century for the Air Force to admit the truth, but these misidentified radar reflectors likely accounted for what became the famed flying saucers. As many people believed, there was indeed a government coverup, but it was of a classified project and not of an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The government\u2019s secrecy fed into conspiracy theories and allowed people to come up with wild explanations for these sightings.\n\nGovernment secrecy also contributed to mythbuilding around the infamous research facility Area 51, which the military did not acknowledge existed until 2013. Since the 1950s, this top-secret research facility was used to test advanced military technology including F-117, SR-71 and B2 Spirit stealth aircraft. But from a military perspective, confusion around these mysterious reported \u201calien sightings\u201d created a mythical smokescreen that also helpfully hid the advanced technologies the US military was testing from adversary nations.\n\nThe film includes differing perspectives from Alejandro Rojas, a UFO journalist from Enigma Labs; Jacob Haqq-Misra, an astrobiologist for the Blue Marble Space Institute; Michael Wong, Planetary Scientist from the Carnegie Institute for Science; Hakeem Oluysei, an astrophysicist from George Mason University; and UAP/UFO investigator Mick West who takes viewers through some common sense experiments that may debunk some of the viral videos captured by some of the best pilots in the world.\n\nVideogame Science and UFOs with Mick West\n\nWatch On Your Schedule: \u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d will be available for streaming at pbs.org/nova, NOVA on YouTube, the PBS Documentaries Prime Video Channel, and the PBS app, available on iOS, Android, Roku streaming devices, Apple TV, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Samsung Smart TV, Chromecast and VIZIO.\n\nCredits: A NOVA production by Terri Randall Productions.

            "article_content": "Steven Soderbergh has never made a horror movie, and certainly not of the ghostly, haunted variety. His movies tend to be exacting, precise, so even when they\u2019re frightening, as with the stalker nightmare Unsane or the chilling disease thriller Contagion, that fear comes from witnessing a process failing with just as much efficiency as when it succeeds. Death, as depicted in his new horror thriller Presence, has no such clarity of success and failure. The sense of loss left behind feels like a kind of failure, yet it is both inevitable and unknowable. These are some of the mysteries eating away at teenage Chloe (Callina Liang), who has just lost her best friend Nadia to a drug overdose and is now moving into a new house with her semi-functional family.\n\nYes, it\u2019s the old something-not-quite-right-with-this-house-that\u2019s-supposed-to-solve-everything business: Chloe feels shivers of offness in her new home, which concerns her sweet-natured but frustrated father Chris (Chris Sullivan) and mostly annoys her jock brother Tyler (Eddy Maday)\u2014who is the clear favorite of distracted mother Rebecca (Lucy Liu), further bedeviled by some vague but obviously Soderberghian financial malfeasance at work. As far as Rebecca is concerned, that\u2019s the issue that should require discussion in hushed tones, not the creaks and chills of otherness that Chloe feels. Is it Nadia, Chloe wonders? Or just, as her parents assume, an expression of her grief and loneliness?\n\nThe identity question may linger, but there\u2019s no fake suspense over whether Chloe is imagining things. To depict this haunting, Soderbergh imposes a system onto a spiritual dimension where none should necessarily exist: He shoots the entire movie from the point of view of an unseen spirit that does indeed drift through the house; \u201cpresence\u201d is also, essentially, the title character. It\u2019s a Paranormal Activity movie turned inside-out: Rather than a largely stationary camera capturing flickers of spooky but eerily realistic movement in the frame, the camera remains mobile and hovering, its ghostliness an invisible but driving force. Like the Paranormal films, there is an element of surveillance: The camera travels through rooms unnoticed, overhearing bits of conversation and observing actions kept secret from other characters. It\u2019s at once omniscient and deeply subjective. There\u2019s also another technical challenge on hand for Soderbergh, who has professed far more affinity for the cut than the epically long take: to stay true to his POV gimmick, most scenes are staged in single unbroken shots. Cuts move forward in time, not within a scene.\n\nThe simultaneous braininess and gimmickry of this technique, applied to a David Koepp screenplay that unapologetically eschews A Ghost Story-style metaphysical traversing, could have stranded Presence in a liminal zone between shlock and airless experiment. What Soderbergh winds up achieving is more reminiscent of his throwback crime pictures, like the Criss Cross remake The Underneath or more recent thrillers like the period noir No Sudden Move and the intensely Early 2020s Kimi. That is to say that Presence has the story, limited scope, and 85-minute runtime of a 1940s B-picture, infused\u2014as those pictures often were, and as his crime movies usually are\u2014with a disciplined style and contemporary electricity. It\u2019s budget Gothic that\u2019s worth every penny and then some.\n\nIn that context, it\u2019s less surprising that Soderbergh didn\u2019t recruit anyone from his ever-growing unofficial rep company for this cast: No Matt Damon as the dad, no Catherine Zeta-Jones as the mom, no Riley Keough as a cool aunt dropping by. (Julia Fox, however, does have one scene as a real-estate agent. No word on whether she\u2019s bumpin\u2019 that.) The central quartet playing the family all does wonderful work, and in a movie with several talented young performers, frequent stage/TV/character actor Sullivan feels like the belated discovery as the flustered but loving father. The familial relationships that Soderbergh and Koepp set up aren\u2019t necessarily wide-ranging or unpredictable, but as Presence ticks toward an inevitable confrontation, they\u2019re surprisingly involving. There\u2019s a circularity to Presence that is both entirely in keeping with a haunted-house story and, in this telling, even moving. It\u2019s yet another genre that Soderbergh has worked like a problem, and produced an elegant solution.\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nWriter: David Koepp\n\nStarring: Callina Liang, Chris Sullivan, Lucy Liu, Eddy Maday, Julia Fox\n\nRelease Date: January 24, 2025"

            "article_content": "Lucy, I know that you have a son. Did you draw on anything from your personal life for your portrayal of a \u201cboy mom\u201d?\n\nLiu: It\u2019s funny\u2014I didn\u2019t, because [Tyler] was in a very different age range. I just worked off of [David Koepp\u2019s] script because it was all there. It was hard because she\u2019s not necessarily a character that is really easy to understand; there\u2019s a lot of mystery and smoke. There are a lot of secrets, and I love that David doesn\u2019t reveal them, even at the end. You never find out what happened with her work, with her husband, with the lawyer. In some ways, that backstory is a little bit of a MacGuffin. Everything shifts into something much more intangible\u2014emotions of grief and loss and what that does to a person. It opens her up and creates this huge cavern for something else, something that\u2019s not about getting ahead in her work life or her son\u2019s life.\n\nIt\u2019s usually only in films specifically about the Asian American experience that you see an Asian American family. I\u2019m curious if it felt liberating, in some way, to focus purely on the dynamic of a mother and daughter and the themes of the movie without racial identity being a focus.\n\nLiang: A hundred percent. The entire time you were asking that question, I thought, Absolutely. It was very freeing for me to, just once, be cast in something that had nothing [to do with] race. It was nothing about what I looked like, but it was just, simply, you are this person, you\u2019re in a house, you\u2019re experiencing ghost stuff, you\u2019re struggling with your family. Like, just be a girl. Obviously, in the industry, a lot of progress has already been made, but there\u2019s a lot of progress [still] to be made. A lot of tokenism and things like that still happen.\n\nLiu: It\u2019s such a long road. There\u2019s this constant feeling that they\u2019re including somebody for diversity\u2019s sake, like picking one person from each [race or ethnicity] and throwing them in there, or there\u2019s only one role that can be diverse. God forbid, there\u2019s more than one role! It didn\u2019t cross my mind at first because I think Steven was really the focal point, calling me to this whole project. But now that you mention it, I\u2019m seeing, of course, it was such a relief to not have to think about that. It\u2019s not a highlight\u2014it\u2019s just a given."

From on-campus adventures to dazzling talks to \u201cscience night out\u201d events at locations around Texas, the program has a wide range of offerings for all ages.\n\n\u201cAs a public university, our mission extends beyond our work in classrooms and labs \u2013 it also means engaging with the community and having big conversations around scientific themes like artificial intelligence, space exploration, health, the environment and STEM success for a new generation,\u201d said David Vanden Bout, dean of UT\u2019s College of Natural Sciences. \u201cThe Texas Science Festival creates a space for shared exchange and discovery. It helps build bridges between our broader community and the experiences of wonder and excitement that are inherent in science.\u201d\n\nParticipants of all ages are invited to engage with a variety of hot topics in science, get their questions answered and enjoy learning how the world works at participating events. Coordinated program includes longstanding UT events that draw thousands \u2013 like the family-friendly annual STEM Girl Day on Feb. 22 \u2013 to newer, more focused offerings, such as an astronomy talk at a local winery, targeting those 21 and over. This year\u2019s festival theme, \u201cFusing Curiosity with Discovery,\u201d speaks to the wide-ranging program, which kicks off with two events pertaining to science and food and concludes with three days of special sessions related to AI and robotics.\n\nSponsored by The University of Texas at Austin, the festival has events coordinated with two dozen partner organizations. New events continue to be added to the schedule, featuring speakers and presenters including leading scientists, authors, innovators, artists and experts, such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Donna Strickland, professional mountaineer Ed Viesturs and award-winning film director Ian Cheney. The festival\u2019s various performances, panels, screenings and social events explore everything from pathways into science to awe-inspiring phenomena like black holes. Some events provide practical insights into areas like maintaining brain health, navigating the possibilities of new technologies and understanding the implications for homeowners of changing weather in Texas. Participants will also have opportunities to hear about a wide range of interesting subjects: what humans can learn from chimpanzees, how Indigenous people\u2019s knowledge of plants can be useful today and how AI is changing the process of writing and human expression.\n\nNew this year to the Texas Science Festival are:\n\nA series of events about the connections between science and art: Musical Memories: An Evening of Music and Science; aqueous, a dance performance coordinated by Planet Texas 2050 at Waller Creek exploring ecological resilience and conservation concerns; The Science of Modern and Contemporary Public Art Preservation: A Walking Tour showcasing nature- and science-inspired Landmarks art on campus; and several events where winners of UT\u2019s Visualizing Science contest will be on display.\n\nSeveral events billed \u201cScience Night Out,\u201d where in partnership with local film and art organizations, pubs, breweries and wineries, science topics will take center stage, making for an engaging night on the town.\n\nA coordinated collaboration with Texas Robotics, UT\u2019s Machine Learning Lab and the Amazon Science Hub in the last days of the festival will bring together industry stakeholders, academics and community members to learn about the rapid changes happening in AI and robotics.\n\nAstronomy discussions, both live and online, where attendees will learn about subjects like planetary discoveries and exploring Mars, with a NASA Johnson Space Center expert and experts from UT\u2019s McDonald Observatory.\n\nThe Texas Science Festival was launched virtually in 2021, and a hybrid version of the festival was held in 2023. With a few exceptions for events that require tickets, 2025 festival events are free, though space is limited. To learn more, explore options and sign up to attend, visit sciencefest.utexas.edu."

            "article_content": "The UK retail industry is at a pivotal juncture, driven by technological advancements, evolving consumer expectations, and a heightened focus on sustainability. With 2025 on the horizon, retailers are keenly adapting to key trends that promise to redefine the shopping experience. From artificial intelligence-enhanced operations to the rise of ethical retailing, along with innovative financial solutions, these developments are all playing a crucial role in shaping the future of retail.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and machine learning power personalised retail\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing the retail industry, driving significant transformations across businesses of all sizes. While large multinational retailers are at the forefront of adopting these technologies, other sectors, including healthcare and iGaming platforms like crypto casinos UK players can sign up to are also finding innovative ways to harness AI-driven insights.\n\nAcross sectors, AI is being used to provide highly customized client experiences. In the casino sector, personalised promos and game suggestions based on user history are just two uses of AI. Elsewhere, machine learning algorithms are enhancing operational efficiency by optimising inventory levels, predicting demand, and improving supply chain management.\n\nAI chatbots and virtual assistants are becoming indispensable in customer service, offering instant support and resolving queries in real time. Studies indicate that retailers using AI and ML have witnessed an increase in sales and a boost in profitability.\n\nOmnichannel retail becomes the new norm\n\nConsumers increasingly expect a seamless shopping journey across multiple channels, whether they\u2019re browsing online, visiting a physical store, or using a mobile app. As a result, retailers are doubling down on their omnichannel strategies to create a unified experience.\n\nKey initiatives include the implementation of Click and Collect services, real-time inventory visibility across platforms, and streamlined return processes. Retailers are also investing in mobile-friendly shopping platforms, ensuring customers can switch between devices without losing progress in their shopping journeys.\n\n\n\nA notable example is the integration of social media with e-commerce platforms. Through social commerce, brands are allowing consumers to shop directly through platforms like Instagram and TikTok, blurring the line between social engagement and online retail.\n\nSustainability takes centre stage\n\nEnvironmental consciousness has become a deciding factor for today\u2019s consumers, prompting retailers to prioritise sustainability. From product sourcing to packaging, every aspect of retail operations is being scrutinised for its environmental impact.\n\nMajor players in the UK market, including grocery giants and fashion retailers, are stepping up their efforts to reduce carbon footprints. Initiatives such as switching to biodegradable packaging, committing to zero waste, and promoting circular fashion through resale or rental services are becoming increasingly common.\n\nRetailers that emphasise transparency in their supply chains and communicate their sustainability goals effectively are finding favour with environmentally conscious shoppers. This trend is not only shaping buying behaviour but also fostering brand loyalty among a growing segment of eco-minded consumers.\n\nAdvanced technologies streamline operations\n\nTechnological innovation continues to drive efficiencies in the retail sector. A prominent development in this regard is the gradual replacement of traditional barcodes with QR codes. Unlike barcodes, QR codes can store more information and offer consumers additional product details, enhancing the overall shopping experience.\n\nLeading UK supermarkets, including Tesco and Ocado, have already begun rolling out QR codes on select products, such as milk cartons. This move is part of a broader trend towards digitisation aimed at improving both back-end operations and front-end customer interaction.\n\nIn addition to QR codes, retailers are adopting in-store technologies such as smart shelves and automated checkout systems to enhance convenience. The ultimate goal is to reduce friction at various touchpoints, making shopping faster and more enjoyable for consumers.\n\nRising trend: responsible consumerism and the decline of \u2018haul culture\u2019\n\nThe introduction of \u2018haul culture,\u2019 popularised by social media, has led to increased consumption and, consequently, higher return rates. This phenomenon, driven by younger consumers eager to showcase their shopping hauls online, poses significant challenges for retailers in terms of logistics and sustainability.\n\nIn response, many brands are adopting strategies to curb excessive returns, including improved product descriptions, enhanced sizing tools, and augmented reality (AR) fitting solutions. Retailers are also working to educate consumers on the environmental impact of returns and promote thoughtful purchasing habits.\n\nAdditionally, there is a growing emphasis on responsible consumerism. Retailers are encouraging shoppers to make more sustainable choices by highlighting the longevity and ethical sourcing of products. This trend reflects a broader cultural shift towards mindful consumption and away from fast fashion and impulsive buying.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe retail landscape in 2025 is set for significant transformation as businesses adapt to technological advancements, sustainability pressures, and changing consumer behaviours. Retailers that successfully navigate these trends stand to benefit from increased customer loyalty, operational efficiencies, and long-term profitability.\n\nAs AI-driven personalisation, omnichannel experiences, and ethical practices become standard, the future of retail promises to be both exciting and dynamic. Brands that remain agile and responsive to these developments will not only survive but thrive in this evolving marketplace."

Just a month later, the company announced a breakthrough in combining multiple AI models in dynamic ways. And most recently, they\u2019ve shown that their AI platform, VersAI\u2122, trains models 3,000 times faster than Google AutoML on standard benchmark datasets.\n\nSo, how are they pulling this off?\n\nThe answer lies in their proprietary VersAI\u2122 technology.\n\nUnlike most AI companies \u2013 which rely on off-the-shelf AI tools from giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI \u2013 Verseon has built its own proprietary AI technology from the ground up. These other companies primarily use Deep Learning frameworks that depend on vast amounts of high-quality training data to function properly. \u201cBig Data\u201d in the form of billions of web pages is available to train large language models, and in the form of millions of transactions for specific products to train models that make personalized shopping recommendations. But in most AI use cases, large, dense datasets like those are hard to come by.\n\nFor most real-world applications, the available datasets are small and sparse. This poses a significant challenge for traditional Deep Learning. Most AI companies today struggle to gather enough high-quality data to build reliable models for their intended applications.\n\nAs Guang-Bin Huang, a professor at NTU in Singapore and one of the lead authors of a landmark AI paper, points out, \u201cWhile deep learning excels in certain applications, it\u2019s not the best approach for small or sparse datasets. In these cases, its performance can be severely limited.\u201d\n\nVerseon, however, has developed an entirely new AI architecture that is specifically designed to handle small, sparse datasets \u2013 the kind that are common in many real-world applications, including drug discovery.\n\nWhat Makes VersAI\u2122 Different from Deep Learning?\n\nThe key difference lies in the neural network structure. In any AI system, the neural network is composed of input nodes (where data enters), hidden nodes (which process the data), and output nodes (where the results are produced).\n\nDeep Learning uses a monolithic neural network with multiple hidden layers to process data. The more complex the data, the more layers are required, and each additional layer adds significant computational overhead. As a result, training these models is slow and resource-intensive.\n\nVersAI\u2122, by contrast, takes a fundamentally different approach. As Verseon\u2019s Ed Ratner describes, \u201cUnlike Deep Learning AI, VersAI uses a completely novel and proprietary neural \u2018network of networks\u2019 architecture.\u201d Instead of using one large network with many layers, VersAI\u2122 uses multiple smaller, independent neural networks, each with a single hidden layer. These networks process the data in parallel, and then their outputs are dynamically weighted and combined to generate a final result. This method substantially reduces the error rate in predictions for small and sparse datasets. And it also consistently reduces model-training times regardless of the size or density of the training dataset.\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nDeep Learning models become dramatically more complicated and slower as the size and complexity of training data increase, leading to longer training times and consequent delays in building deployable models. In contrast, VersAI\u2019s 3,000 times faster training allows building models in near real time \u2013 a virtue critical in applications like ecommerce where trends can change fast.\n\nThis training time advantage also leads to much lower deployment costs. The reduced computational intensity of training models in VersAI\u2122 relative to Deep Learning not only requires less costly computer hardware, but it also uses far less electricity. In short, VersAI\u2122 is much greener AI.\n\nA Pharma Company Revolutionizing AI\n\nIt\u2019s truly remarkable that a pharmaceutical company is at the forefront of developing fundamental new AI technology that outperforms industry titans like Google, Meta, and OpenAI \u2013 particularly when it comes to handling the small, sparse datasets that are common in real-world applications. And the potential of VersAI\u2122 extends far beyond drug discovery. Given its impressive performance so far, this innovative technology could have a transformative impact on the reliability and effectiveness of AI across many consumer, science, and business applications, improving the way AI is used in our everyday lives."

            "article_content": "Rupay Credit Card on UPI\n\nCustomers using RuPay credit cards linked to UPI do 40 transactions per month average, eight times higher than traditional credit card users, according to an analysis done by RuPay credit card fintech Kiwi.\n\nThe higher frequency helped RuPay corner a 12 percent market share for card transaction volume in 2024, compared to the three percent the payment network had in 2023, the Kiwi report said.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nBoth RuPay and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) are run by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). UPI is the country\u2019s most popular digital payment method cornering around 85 percent of all such transactions.\n\nRuPay is a domestic card network that competes with global giants Visa and Mastercard. Only RuPay cards are allowed to be linked to UPI as per the regulations.\n\nThe cumulative monthly transaction value of RuPay is around Rs 14,000 crore, while the overall credit card network value is around Rs 1.8 lakh crore, which translates into a 7.5 percent market share in value.\n\nAround two-thirds of all RuPay credit card transactions happen through UPI. A year ago, RuPay was doing around Rs 10,000 worth of transactions in a month, of which 50 percent came through UPI.\n\nWhile RuPay is the most successful debit card platform with more than 80 percent of the market share in cards issued, it trails Visa and Mastercard in credit cards, where the spending is much higher. However, with the linking of RuPay credit cards with UPI, the platform has now cornered a 25 percent market share in new credit cards issued in the country. There are around 10.5 crore active credit cards in the country as per the Reserve Bank of India data.\n\nHowever, RuPay network's popularity has been surging over the last year as customers get the best of credit card rewards with the convenience and reach of UPI. While there are only 9o lakh card-accepting merchants, there are an estimated 32 crore UPI merchants.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nRuPay credit card spending is growing at 5 percent monthly, reaching an average of Rs 40,000 per user, according to data available with Kiwi. The company, is one of the early adopters of enabling virtual RuPay credit cards (issued by Axis Bank and Yes Bank) that can be linked with their UPI accounts. Kiwi has raised a little less than $20 million until now and does around Rs 300 crore worth of transactions in a month.\n\nHowever, the average transaction value is Rs 1,100, much lower compared to Visa and Mastercard, where the average transaction value is around Rs 4,000. This is mostly because the cards are still mostly used for daily small-value payments, where the customers earlier used to pay with UPI.\n\n\u201cUPI-enabled credit cards are transforming how millions of Indians engage with credit, By combining the convenience and widespread acceptance of UPI with the power of credit, we are seeing a new wave of financial inclusion. This empowers individuals with more responsible, accessible, and transparent financial tools, driving a shift towards smarter spending habits and responsible credit usage,\u201d says Mohit Bedi, cofounder of Kiwi.\n\nThis surge is benefiting local retailers and small merchants, with 75 percent of transactions being conducted at grocery shops and other small businesses in the country.\n\nDue to a high merchant discount rate \u2013 or the commission that merchants pay to card issuing banks and payment providers \u2013 most small merchants are reluctant to accept credit cards. On the other hand, merchants using RuPay credit cards on UPI are charged fees only for transactions exceeding Rs 2,000, making them particularly attractive to small businesses that previously avoided credit cards. RuPay had also faced some resistance from merchants in the past.\n\nMost credit card users have more than one credit card and customers are increasingly opting for virtual RuPay credit cards as their second or third, with 50 percent of these cards being digital ones. They are also more popular with younger customers with around 45 percent of users in the under 30 age group, and another 30 percent of users between ages 31 and 40.\n\nThe rise of RuPay has been helped by the regulatory diktats. Last year, RBI mandated all card issuers (mostly banks) to offer consumers the option to choose their card network when applying for a new credit card or when renewing their credit cards. This ended the decades-old way of banks entering into exclusive agreements with Visa and Mastercard. In August, NPCI also directed banks to ensure RuPay credit cardholders receive rewards on par with other networks.\n\nRuPay\u2019s growing foothold in the domestic credit card market is particularly significant as geopolitical tensions highlight the importance of domestic payment systems. The recent exclusion of Russian payment systems from global networks like Visa and Mastercard has underscored the need for nations to develop independent solutions.\n\nNPCI is working with several countries to develop a similar domestic card network. It is also entering into bilateral partnerships with other countries that will enable international RuPay card payments without the help of other card networks."

In fact, Blinkit, on January 22, announced a partnership with Xiaomi and Nokia to expand its smartphone category beyond iPhones.\n\nTesting the waters\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nWhile firms like HP and Acer have started selling laptops, other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are testing the waters by listing accessories like keyboards, mice, and printers, to gauge initial demand.\n\nTaiwanese PC manufacturer Asus, for instance, announced a partnership with Zepto last week to list a range of accessories, including keyboards and mice, on the platform, made available in major cities like Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru.\n\n\u201cWe also plan to expand its presence on other quick commerce platforms such as Blinkit and Instamart further broadening our reach and ensuring greater accessibility for consumers across India,\u201d said Arnold Su, Vice President, Consumer and Gaming PC, System Business Group, Asus.\n\nLenovo, India\u2019s second-largest PC marker, is adopting a similar approach of listing smaller tech accessories. It is, however, seeing sales gradually pick up for larger ticket items. Its products are currently available on Blinkit.\n\n\u201cCurrently, on Zepto, our Lenovo Tab M11 is the most purchased tablet and we\u2019re optimistic about scaling this channel further to enhance accessibility and convenience for our customers,\u201d said Dinesh Nair, Director of Consumer Business, Lenovo India.\n\nNew growth channel\n\nIndia\u2019s traditional PC market (inclusive of desktops, notebooks, and workstations) shipped an all-time high of 4.49 million units in the third quarter of calendar year 2024, up 0.1 percent year-over-year (YoY), amid the festival season last year, according to a report by the International Data Corporation (IDC).\n\nHP led the market with a share of 29 percent, followed by Lenovo and Dell Technologies with a market share of 17.3 percent and 14.6 percent, respectively. The Acer Group occupied the fourth spot at 14.6 percent again, with Asus rounding out the top five at 9.7 percent, the report showed.\n\nAs the country\u2019s PC market continues to grow, India's $5.5 billion quick commerce market is emerging as the next phase of online growth for many PC manufacturers.\n\n\u201cWe believe quick commerce is the future of e-commerce and offers us a new avenue to expand our reach and serve more customers,\u201d said Su.\n\nAccording to the Asus executive, traditional e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon have not been able to meet the growing need for faster deliveries, and quick commerce has emerged as a channel that can complement existing online platforms.\n\n\u201cWhile some may perceive quick commerce as a threat to established online players, we view it as an opportunity to reach a niche customer base in need of products beyond just daily groceries or FMCG items,\u201d he said.\n\nFor other OEMs, it is still early days and quick commerce is currently just another channel that they want to expand their presence to.\n\n\u201cAs a brand, our focus remains on serving our customers across all platforms\u2014whether it\u2019s through offline retail stores, online and e-commerce channels, or emerging quick commerce solutions. By embracing innovative distribution models, we are ensuring that our customers can access HP products wherever and whenever they need them,\u201d said HP\u2019s Gehani.\n\nEarly days for laptops on quick commerce\n\nWhether laptops take off in a big way via quick commerce remains to be seen. Analysts tracking the sector expect the category to make up a small share of quick commerce sales for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cIt will require considerable effort to scale the laptop and PC category on quick commerce. Sales in this category are expected to remain between 2-3 percent in the medium term,\u201d said an internet sector analyst.\n\nRegardless, PC makers are of the view that quick commerce players with strong execution will be able to drive sales, as demand for high-value electronics on quick commerce continues to rise.\n\n\u201cThis depends on how quick commerce players are going to solve the need for a larger selection for buyers along with the convenience of delivery in 10-30 minutes,\u201d said Goel."

            "article_content": "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are needed for businesses to have good control over key processes such as accounting, supply chain, manufacturing, HR and many more. In recent years, however, with the advent of cloud computing, businesses now have a choice to deploy ERP solutions on-premise or in the cloud.\n\nCloud and on-premise ERPs have vastly different integration capabilities and methods. In order to decide which integration approach would be better for a business, you need to consider factors like cost, scalability, data security and customizability.\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive comparison between cloud and on-premise ERP integrations across critical factors that technology decision-makers must consider before selecting an integration approach. It also offers advice on determining if your business is better suited for the cloud or on-premise ERP ecosystem based on your operating model, growth objectives and enterprise architecture.\n\nCloud ERP Integration Overview\n\nERP solutions for the cloud from ERP software development services can be hosted on vendor or third-party servers and accessed through the Internet. With this deployment model, businesses don\u2019t have to invest in on-premise hardware and ERP infrastructure.\n\nCloud ERP systems such as Oracle NetSuite, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, and Infor CloudSuite are more commonly built using modern API-led connectivity protocols rather than traditional on-premise approaches like batch data transfers or point-to-point integration.\n\nKey integration capabilities with cloud ERP deployments include:\n\nReal-time data sync between cloud ERP and other SaaS apps via APIs\n\nSimple app integration through cloud ERP marketplaces\n\nPrebuilt connectors to popular SaaS platforms like ecommerce, payments, marketing automation etc\n\nEDI and supply chain integration through cloud B2B networks\n\nIntegration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) for interfacing legacy on-premise systems\n\nAgility and Speed\n\nThe API-led architecture of cloud ERP systems integration accelerates the implementation of new apps and workflows to keep pace with business priorities. IT can build integrations in days/weeks rather than months with on-premise ERPs.\n\nLower TCO\n\nWith cloud ERP system integration, there is no need for upfront capital expenditure on integration software, hardware and middleware. Businesses only pay for used capacity as an operating expense.\n\nScalability\n\nYou can easily scale prebuilt and custom integrations to handle higher transaction loads as your ERP data integration volume grows without disruption. Usage-based pricing allows paying for only additional capacity.\n\nEnhanced Data Security\n\nCloud ERP vendors spend a lot of money on advanced security controls like encryption, tokenization, role-based access etc., and the integrations built using these systems also come with the same security capabilities.\n\nInnovation Velocity\n\nCloud ERP platforms are often updated, so their integration capabilities utilize the latest technologies, such as AI/ML, blockchain, advanced analytics, etc. On-premise systems do not provide these latest integration features.\n\nKey Challenges with Cloud ERP Integration\n\nWhile cloud ERP integrations accelerate digitization, some downsides need consideration:\n\nVendor dependence risk\n\nBusinesses become technologically wedded to the cloud ERP vendor. Migrating large data volumes across systems is challenging if the provider relationship turns sour later.\n\nCustomization constraints\n\nAlthough configuration is possible, custom-coding cloud ERPs like SAP S/4HANA Cloud are restricted. It limits bespoke modification of prebuilt integrations.\n\nIntegration costs add up\n\nWhile cloud ERP software integration needs lower initial investment, custom development and licensing connector apps in the marketplace incur ongoing costs.\n\nIntegration testing limitations\n\nCloud ERP vendors don\u2019t always fully simulate live production scenarios during integration ERP system testing, which can hinder the anticipation of post-go-live issues.\n\nCloud vendor technical support\n\nWhile some cloud ERP vendors provide prompt, expert technical support for complex integration issues and niche troubleshooting that requires troubleshooting skills, others don\u2019t.\n\nOn-Premise ERP Integration Overview\n\nSAP ECC, Oracle E-Business Suite, and Infor LN are ERP software installed on on-premises servers in the company system. The administration of the ERP platform and databases and the management of upgrades, security patches, and fixes are all the responsibilities of the IT team.\n\nLegacy B2B protocols like EDI and point-to-point middleware have historically dominated integration architectures for on-premise ERP deployments. However, modern integration tools like Boomi, MuleSoft and Microsoft BizTalk now empower API-based connectivity even with on-premise ERPs.\n\nHere are some of the prominent ERP integration methods with on-premise ERP platforms:\n\nEDI for B2B data interchange with supply chain partners\n\nPoint-to-point integration using middleware\n\nAPI connectivity to/from ERP using an integration platform (iPaaS)\n\nBatch data integration for periodic large data transfers\n\nOn-premise or hosted integration platform installations\n\nChange data capture for detecting and propagating updates\n\nEnterprise service buses (ESB) for routing integration traffic\n\nProcess integration with business process management (BPM) tools\n\nWhile cloud integration delivers agility, on-premise ERP integration brings other strategic advantages:\n\nCustomization Freedom\n\nOn-premise ERPs allow modifications to source code to enhance and tailor prebuilt integrations. They offer greater flexibility than cloud ERPs.\n\nBetter Legacy Connectivity\n\nOn-premise ERP software integration tools have well-established legacy protocol adapters that seamlessly interface with outdated systems. Thus, it is easier to retain legacy compatibility while upgrading an integrated ERP system.\n\nContinuity During Outages\n\nIntegration processes are minimally disrupted when the internet goes down as servers are inside the corporate firewall. The problem is that if externally hosted systems become unavailable, cloud integration workflows stop.\n\nStricter Data Security\n\nDirect control over servers without surrendering them to cloud vendors for stringent compliance and security reasons are some highly regulated industries such as defense and banking, etc.\n\nSuperior Support Mechanisms\n\nOn-premise ERP platforms allow easier leveraging of internal IT talent and external system integrators for technical support during complex integration issues. Resolution times are faster.\n\nKey Challenges with On-Premise ERP Integration\n\nHowever, businesses pay a steep price for the wide-ranging control and customizability delivered by on-premise ERP integration in certain areas:\n\nInflexible and slow\n\nDiplomatic protocols and point-to-point links between on-premise ERP and surrounding systems make agile integration challenging. Responding to changing needs involves prolonged development and testing cycles.\n\nSubstantial hardware demands\n\nMaintaining high-performance infrastructure for integration middleware, databases, backup systems etc., drives up capital expenditure costs with on-premise ERP integration.\n\nScaling limitations\n\nPhysical capacity in the on-premise data center constricts the addition of integration infrastructure to handle higher transaction volumes during business growth.\n\nVendor dependence\n\nWhile customization is possible, skilled resources for legacy ERP platforms like SAP ECC are dwindling. This compels businesses to pay premiums for vendor consulting.\n\nWaning innovation\n\nVendors are focused on developing their cloud ERP offerings. As a result, fewer cutting-edge features reach on-premise product versions through upgrades, causing integration capabilities to lag.\n\nMaking the Right Choice: Cloud vs On-Premise ERP Integration\n\nWhile both cloud and on-premise ERP integration models have trade-offs, the right choice depends on your business priorities and IT landscape:\n\nTransaction volume \u2013 High-volume integration needs may require on-premise for optimal performance\n\nHigh-volume integration needs may require on-premise for optimal performance Budget \u2013 Cloud integration with pay-per-usage may suit mid-market firms reluctant to large upfront investment\n\nCloud integration with pay-per-usage may suit mid-market firms reluctant to large upfront investment Agility needs \u2013 Frequently changing integration needs favor cloud ERPs for swift reconfiguration\n\nFrequently changing integration needs favor cloud ERPs for swift reconfiguration Compliance needs \u2013 Heavily regulated industries may prefer on-premise for localized security control\n\nHeavily regulated industries may prefer on-premise for localized security control Legacy landscape \u2013 Lots of outdated surround systems prefer on-premise integration with better legacy bridges\n\nLots of outdated surround systems prefer on-premise integration with better legacy bridges Innovation culture \u2013 Businesses that reward innovation gravitate towards cloud ERP\u2019s latest integration features\n\nBusinesses that reward innovation gravitate towards cloud ERP\u2019s latest integration features Application landscape \u2013 A predominantly cloud-based application portfolio suits cloud ERP integration, while on-premise apps align with on-premise ERP integrations\n\nIn addition, if an organization has a long-term hybrid enterprise architecture strategy, it can use both cloud and on-premise integration models at the same time.\n\nFor example, you can keep legacy on-premise ERP integration and cloud ERP integration with new SaaS capabilities. It allows you to pivot from existing systems to becoming cloud native at a sensible pace, keeping the critical operations running.\n\nThe bimodal integration architecture will align business IT objectives in terms of agility, innovation and risk mitigation.\n\nConclusion\n\nCloud ERP integration addresses serious challenges like inflexibility, upgrade headaches, and high total cost of ownership of legacy on-premise ERP platforms, albeit with its limitations: vendor dependency and customization constraints.\n\nWhile cloud ERP integration has compelling advantages for most modernizing enterprises, it deserves a careful analysis of your integration needs, IT ecosystem, business priorities and target operating model before you leap.\n\nAs cloud ERP adoption picks up sharply through 2025, the selection of integration technology now represents a watershed moment for the right digital transformation and innovation cadence.\n\nAfter methodically weighing the pros and cons of available integration approaches, choose wisely when to go with one, and then avoid modernization journeys that are completely misaligned and can seriously impede what you are trying to achieve with modernization."

            "article_content": "Sharing Data Makes Every Agency Stronger\n\nIn the realm of public safety and security, the integration of open architecture surveillance systems promises to significantly enhance interagency collaboration and operational efficiency.\n\nOpen architecture surveillance dissolves traditional barriers of proprietary systems, enabling a seamless flow of information among public sector entities, including law enforcement, emergency services, municipal administrations and even private sector organizations.\n\nThe collaborations that stem from these central, shared insights foster a unified approach to public safety that helps all factions involved do more with less. This, in turn, augments the collective capacity to respond to emergencies, manage resources and ensure safer cities.\n\nRELATED: Law enforcement agencies and utilities will digitize physical security in 2025.\n\nData-Driven Decision-Making Enhances Law Enforcement Outcomes\n\nIn 2019, law enforcement in Canada deployed a real-time intelligent center that integrates various streams of information, including live surveillance footage from stationary or body-worn cameras, social media monitoring, actionable insights, data analytics and other intelligence sources. This stream of data provides law enforcement officers with improved awareness into ongoing incidents and potential threats.\n\nBeyond law enforcement, these centers often support broader public safety efforts, including emergency response coordination, disaster management and event security planning. For example, officers can work with other units, government entities and private organizations to centrally access aggregated event video feeds, data analytics and intelligence that may indicate emerging threats or criminal activities. This allows for a swift and unified response to incidents, where personnel are better equipped and directed where they are most needed.\n\nWith open architecture, surveillance systems shift toward interoperability and flexibility, and devices such as sensors, infrared cameras and even lighting controls can all run on the same communication protocol.\n\nIn the U.S., Project Green Light Detroit similarly uses open architecture and seamless collaboration between public and private entities. The Detroit Police Department initiated the project in 2016, partnering with eight gas stations equipped with real-time camera connections to police headquarters. The innovative public-private community partnership enhances neighborhood safety, supports local businesses and strengthens crime prevention efforts.\n\nOver the years, participants have installed high-definition cameras, upgraded network connections and improved lighting on their properties. The police department and the city provide staff to monitor and analyze video feeds in the real-time crime center.\n\nLEARN MORE: Moving physical security to the cloud boosts efficiency.\n\nSharing Resources Yields a Reduced Environmental Impact\n\nAnother key benefit of open architecture systems is that they allow multiple agencies to share surveillance infrastructure and data, reducing the need for each entity to deploy its own hardware. This collaborative approach can decrease the environmental impact associated with manufacturing, operating and disposing of electronic surveillance equipment. Open architecture systems also allow for the use of cloud-based services and more efficient data centers, which consume less energy compared with traditional, decentralized systems.\n\nOpen architecture systems are also inherently flexible and scalable, allowing for easier updates and integration of new technologies without complete system overhauls. For example, you can add features such as network speakers to improve communication and even provide verbal warnings to deter certain behaviors. Network intercoms can provide audiovisual identification and remote entry control.\n\nOther examples might include body-worn solutions for private security and law enforcement, analytics to improve operator efficiency, radar to follow intruders, and even strobe sirens for safety and deterrence.\n\nLater expansion of the systems would make it possible to extend the lifespan of existing infrastructure while reducing waste and demand for new materials.\n\nDIVE DEEPER: State and local governments can build data centers sustainably.\n\nCost Sharing Minimizes Expenditures\n\nThe collaborative nature of open architecture surveillance allows for cost sharing among participating units, government agencies and organizations. This can include shared expenses for acquisition, maintenance and upgrades. The net results of cost sharing include significant savings and more efficient use of public funds.\n\nAgencies and entities that buy in will ultimately experience a higher ROI. They can integrate and upgrade systems as needed without replacing entire setups, which helps ensure that investments remain valuable over a longer period, further contributing to economic sustainability.\n\nIn the end, public agencies and law enforcement can optimize their use of available resources through the sharing of surveillance data and open architecture systems. This leads to more efficient deployment of personnel and equipment, further reducing unnecessary expenditures and environmental impact.\n\nAdhering to Privacy and Data Protection Requirements\n\nWhile the benefits are substantial, the implementation of open architecture surveillance systems is not without challenges; in particular, privacy, data protection and cybersecurity need to be placed front and center to safeguard all data in transit among agencies and other entities, and at rest.\n\nNevertheless, the transition to open architecture surveillance systems represents a forward-thinking approach to public sector operations and safety. By overcoming the limitations of siloed, proprietary systems, agencies can enhance their collaborative efforts, operational efficiency and, ultimately, their service to the community.\n\nWith that in mind, this transition requires a commitment to technological innovation, but the principles of privacy, security and ethical governance must remain priorities. As we move forward, the main goal should remain leveraging technology to serve the public good, ensuring safer, more secure and united cities and towns.\n\nUP NEXT: Cybersecurity mesh strengthens security for state and local governments."

Elspeth Hayes\n\n6\n\nBut now, scientists have revealed they are actually ancient monuments crafted by Aboriginal people called the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung - the traditional owners of the land.\n\nTheir findings were described in a new study published in Australian Archaeology.\n\nResearchers estimate there were once over 400 of these structures across New South Wales and Queensland in eastern Australia, but only around 100 remain today.\n\nFar fewer have ever been discovered in the southern-most state of Victoria, but the five around the town of Sunbury are amongst them.\n\nMany other rings of this kind are thought to have been destroyed by European settlers when they colonised the land.\n\nIt is believed the ancient people would dig out earth and build it into mounds that formed the large circles, hundreds of metres across, that are still visible today.\n\nIt is also now understood the circles continue to be very important historically and culturally to Aboriginal people today.\n\nElders of the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung culture explained that the rings are used to reflect on themes including the European occupation, colonisation, self-determination, adaptation and resilience of the people.\n\nPrevious studies had indicated that the sites were associated with sacred locations, but had not unearthed any of the cultural value now understood.\n\nThe Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung people led a new archaeological excavation of one of the rings, known as Sudbury Ring G, in 2022, which has allowed these new revelations.\n\nPompeii bombshell as analysis of mummies may reveal who they REALLY are\n\nRing G is thought to be a ceremonial meeting spot for Aboriginal ancestors and was first excavated in 1979 by archaeologist David Frankel.\n\nSome 166 artefacts were unearthed in this initial dig, and Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung people also led the re-analysis of these.\n\nThis involved dating the ring deposits to estimate when it was created, and studying wear patterns to understand how the ancient people used stone tools.\n\n6 Some 166 artefacts were found in the dig of Sunbury Ring G Credit: Caroline Spry/Australian Archaeology\n\n6 The Aboriginal ancestors of those who built the ring led the re-analysis of these stone remnants Credit: Caroline Spry/Australian Archaeology\n\nThe study revealed that the ring was constructed somewhere between 590 and 1,400 years ago.\n\nIt showed that the people spent time in the area clearing the land and plants, scraping back soil and layering rocks.\n\nThey also lit campfires, made stone tools and moved items around in the ring's interior.\n\nWear patterns and residues on some of the tools suggest Woi-wurring people people may have used them to to create feather adornments and scar human skin for ceremony and decoration.\n\nThe scientists behind the study said in Live Science: \"[the research] expands our understanding of the richness and diversity of Australia's archaeological record, created over more than 65,000 years of continuous occupation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\".\n\nThey added: \"[The study] demonstrates the importance of further investigating and preserving these earth rings, as well as others known to occur across eastern Australia.\n\n\"This is especially important in the face of continued threats by land development and climate change which threaten the survival of earth rings.\""

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nOver a span of several days last week, multiple sightings of UFOs were made in the Fresno, California area with no explanation ever revealed. A couple of the UFO sightings were even reported to the local airport tower by pilots.\n\nThe first UFO sighting occurred early in the morning when a light was recorded in the sky by a news tower camera just after 4 a.m. Fox 26 News reported that \u201cthe light appeared to hover over downtown Fresno.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you see that object move at the clip it moves and it\u2019s hovering again,\u201d said Earl Grey Anderson from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), who reviewed the footage. \u201cThat one I would probably actually give an unknown classification to which is a UFO.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I thought was very interesting about the second video is the clip. It suddenly moves. I\u2019m not sure what distance we\u2019re looking at there. It wasn\u2019t light speed or anything like that but that was awfully fast. You\u2019ve got an interesting capture there somebody saw what I would technically call a UFO.\u201d\n\nThe day after the initial UFO sighting, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara captured video of another UFO in the time, this time in broad daylight.\n\nThree days later, during the afternoon, a private pilot radioed the Fresno airport tower with a report of something unidentified in the sky. A second pilot reported an object following him at 3,500 feet.\n\nTower: \u201cYou saw something over downtown at 3,500?\u201d Pilot: \u201cCorrect. It looked like a white object.\u201d Tower: \u201cHow long was this?\u201d Pilot: \u201cI just lost it right now.\u201d\n\nSeveral other people in the area also reported taking video of similar objects in the sky at the time. Jeanette Herrera of Fresno reported seeing it on back-to-back days, and it\u2019s not the first time she has seen UFOs over the city.\n\n\u201cI saw that one video of the orb and I was like\u2026 well, wait a second. I\u2019ve got good video of these things,\u201d said Herrera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve filmed that particular orb at least three or four times in the last two weeks,\u201d Herrera continued, \u201cIt almost does this like firework thing where it blows up and then reappears in a different area. So, it just does that constantly and then sometimes it won\u2019t. It\u2019ll just stay like a little solid looking orb.\u201d\n\nA Fresno police helicopter, which investigated the one of the pilot\u2019s reports, and efforts to reach the Federal Aviation Administration in Fresno both proved fruitless for providing an explanation for the mysterious UFO sightings."

Now, these mysterious phenomena are moving out of the shadows and into the light, as NASA pledges to study them scientifically. So, what exactly does science have to say on the matter?\n\nThis new NOVA investigation looks at the evidence from every angle, marshaling expert opinions from physicists, engineers, cosmologists, and others who are bringing new technologies and heightened rigor to solving these mysteries. How can new ground-based sensors and crowdsourcing of data help explain what military pilots and others have seen? Many of these sightings can be attributed to physical objects like balloons or drones, weather phenomena, or optical illusions, but others so far remain mysterious. What other potential explanations remain? Could they be the result of secret new technologies developed by other governments \u2014 or our own? And what would it take for alien engineers to traverse vast distances to send probes or visit Earth from other solar systems?\n\nFilmmaker Quote:\n\n\u201cWe are living in an age of conspiracy, and we need facts now more than ever,\u201d said Producer, Director and Writer Terri Randall. \u201cThis film is able to address some of the viewer's most urgent questions about UFOs from a scientific perspective. There is so much taboo and confusion surrounding the topic, and while there is still so much we don\u2019t know, science can help us say, \u2018this might not be as scary as we think.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe public fascination with UFOs began to grow after pilot Kenneth Arnold spotted something strange as he flew near Mount Rainier, WA in 1947. He described objects glinting off the sun and moving as if they were skipping off of water, and hence the term flying saucer was coined. This famed sighting, along with many others, ignited public interest with more and more sightings being reported. During this post-World War II period, military technology was also developing at a rapid pace \u2014 often in secret \u2014 which could account for some of the bizarre objects people were seeing in the sky, including the infamous military balloon crash in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.\n\nSince this balloon\u2019s technology was top secret at the time, the U.S. Army announced that it was just a conventional weather balloon. But the public didn\u2019t buy that explanation, and the government\u2019s lack of answers created a void, which Hollywood saw as an opportunity, and entertainment featuring flying saucers and dramatic alien invasions proliferated.\n\nBehind the scenes, the military continued to investigate these phenomena. In 1969 the Air Force ended Project Blue Book, which documented investigations of more than 12,000 UFO sightings with 701 of the cases remaining unidentified. But for scientists, not being able to explain so much of the data findings is unacceptable, which along with the pop culture hysteria around UFOs created an environment where the scientific community did not want to touch the topic. Because of this enduring stigma, NASA now refers to UFOs as UAPs: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena.\n\n\u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d features firsthand accounts from former Lt. US Navy and F/A-18F pilot Ryan Graves, whose squadron witnessed the famed \u201cGimbal\u201d \u2014 the first UAP video to be declassified by the Department of Defense \u2014 aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida in 2015. Graves was also the first active-duty military pilot to come forward about regular sightings of UFOs.\n\nThe film also introduces viewers to the U.S. Naval Officer and F/A-18F pilot Alex Dietrich, who in 2004 as a young aviator in training, witnessed what is considered to be one of the most important UAP encounters known as the USS Nimitz-Tic-Tac. Videos of both of these encounters were finally released to the public in 2017 when The New York Times published a landmark article on UAPs. It created a massive media frenzy which captured the attention of members of Congress who began to demand transparency. The science community took notice as well, but scientific investigation demands evidence \u2014 presenting a myriad of obstacles in this regard.\n\nWATCH: Navy pilot describes encounter with 'Tic Tac' shaped unidentified flying object\n\n\u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d features interviews with several of the distinguished scientists that NASA brought together to examine the UFO mystery:\n\n\n\nThe film documents an experiment from Semester and Kirkpatrick examining how the elusive nature of infrared light could be the key to solving the mystery of why some UAPs seem to appear and then disappear in these viral videos captured by military pilots.\n\n\u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d goes on to examine why the US government continued to be so elusive about rumored UFO sightings for many decades. It turned out that the debris a rancher found in Roswell, New Mexico back in 1947 was part of a classified program called Project Mogul where the Air Force launched balloons with sensors that could measure vibrations in order to monitor Russian nuclear testing.\n\nIt took half a century for the Air Force to admit the truth, but these misidentified radar reflectors likely accounted for what became the famed flying saucers. As many people believed, there was indeed a government coverup, but it was of a classified project and not of an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The government\u2019s secrecy fed into conspiracy theories and allowed people to come up with wild explanations for these sightings.\n\nGovernment secrecy also contributed to mythbuilding around the infamous research facility Area 51, which the military did not acknowledge existed until 2013. Since the 1950s, this top-secret research facility was used to test advanced military technology including F-117, SR-71 and B2 Spirit stealth aircraft. But from a military perspective, confusion around these mysterious reported \u201calien sightings\u201d created a mythical smokescreen that also helpfully hid the advanced technologies the US military was testing from adversary nations.\n\nThe film includes differing perspectives from Alejandro Rojas, a UFO journalist from Enigma Labs; Jacob Haqq-Misra, an astrobiologist for the Blue Marble Space Institute; Michael Wong, Planetary Scientist from the Carnegie Institute for Science; Hakeem Oluysei, an astrophysicist from George Mason University; and UAP/UFO investigator Mick West who takes viewers through some common sense experiments that may debunk some of the viral videos captured by some of the best pilots in the world.\n\nVideogame Science and UFOs with Mick West\n\nWatch On Your Schedule: \u201cWhat Are UFOs?\u201d will be available for streaming at pbs.org/nova, NOVA on YouTube, the PBS Documentaries Prime Video Channel, and the PBS app, available on iOS, Android, Roku streaming devices, Apple TV, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Samsung Smart TV, Chromecast and VIZIO.\n\nCredits: A NOVA production by Terri Randall Productions.

It was designed in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and ICT, and the evaluation testing and validation were performed in collaboration with the National Security Research Institute (NSR), the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), the Korea Information and Communication Technology Association (TTA), and the IT Security Certification Center (ITSCC), a CC (Common Criteria) certification body responsible for national security evaluation and related regulations, as well as the management of Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA).\n\nThis national accreditation acknowledges Clavis XG as the first quantum-safe cryptography system based on quantum-physics and BB84 QKD protocol to meet stringent national security standards, setting a new milestone in the global quantum cryptography market.\n\nWhile most government organizations must follow the guidelines and policies of their respective national security authorities, NSR's multi-year security evaluation effort marks a significant milestone for the global QKD industry. IDQ will continue to support the undergoing international efforts for a standardized evaluation of quantum-physics based security solutions. Independent security accreditation programs that are designed and performed by experts in national security test labs enable a higher degree of confidence necessary for the migration to quantum-safe communication across enterprise and government sectors.\n\nGr\u00e9goire Ribordy, CEO of ID Quantique, stated, \"This is a massive leap forward for QKD, a physics-based quantum cryptography technology, which has successfully evolved and matured into a telecom grade security solution. We are thrilled to be able to support the cybersecurity strategy of our customers who seek to combine QKD with Post-Quantum Cryptography to mitigate the Quantum threat. The adoption of Clavis XG and Clarion KX platform will expand rapidly in the areas requiring high-level security, such as government, financial services, energy, critical infrastructure, and healthcare verticals.\"\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "A decade ago humanity launched around 200 objects into space per year. Now we launch more than 2,600, with no prospects for slowing down. This rapid expansion of human activity in outer space has filled Earth orbit with space trash, from dead satellites to used-up rocket parts. The region is already so crowded that working satellites run the risk of colliding with bits of garbage from previous generations of spacecraft. Even the International Space Station often has to adjust its orbit to dodge debris.\n\nCurrently there are more than 25,000 pieces of trackable human-made junk larger than 10 centimeters orbiting Earth. The more we put up there, the greater the chance that pieces of debris (traveling at relative speeds up to 15 times faster than a bullet) will strike working spacecraft, creating even more dangerous trash. The catastrophic collision in 2009 between the defunct Russian satellite Cosmos 2251 and the operational Iridium satellite, for example, generated nearly 2,000 debris fragments, many of which are still being tracked today.\n\nOrbital space is a finite resource, and it\u2019s rapidly being consumed by a few organizations, notably SpaceX, OneWeb and Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper. SpaceX, for instance, owns and operates the majority of all working satellites, and the company aims to launch tens of thousands more satellites to provide global broadband Internet coverage. Similarly, Amazon plans to deploy 3,236 satellites for its broadband network.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nGiving everyone unfettered access without global coordination and planning means that eventually no one may be able to use it.\n\nIf we keep up this pace, orbital space will become unusable\u2014especially the most popular region, low Earth orbit (LEO), which extends up to 2,000 kilometers in altitude. When looking at all orbital regions, we may lose services we\u2019ve come to rely on: continuous communications, GPS mapping, Internet, Earth monitoring, and more. Today nearly every satellite that is launched is equivalent to a piece of single-use plastic, in that its fate is to become detritus. We are heading toward a tragedy of the commons in orbital space: giving everyone unfettered access without global coordination and planning means that eventually no one may be able to use it.\n\nAs we continue to push the boundaries of space exploration and commercialization, there is a growing movement to rethink our approach to using the space environment\u2014to move to a strategy anchored in stewardship and sound waste-management principles. I believe we must leave behind our \u201clinear space economy,\u201d where we use and abandon, and move toward a \u201ccircular space economy\u201d\u2014a sustainable way to use space that emphasizes the reuse, recycling, and efficient management of space resources.\n\nJust as we are reckoning with how to conserve ecosystems on Earth for future living creatures, we must think of space as an environment worthy of preservation. In fact, reforming how we operate in space is critical for Earth conservation.\n\nThe production, launch and operation of satellites and rockets consume vast amounts of resources and energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. Rocket launches release pollutants into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, soot and aluminum oxides, which cause atmospheric damage and contribute to climate change.\n\nMoreover, the practice of uncontrolled reentries, where defunct satellites and rocket stages are allowed to burn up in the atmosphere, adds to atmospheric pollution and creates the risk of debris falling on people and property on Earth. In 2024, for instance, pieces of a SpaceX Dragon service module, including one about the size of a standard car hood, landed in the mountains of North Carolina, and a castoff part of the International Space Station fell through the roof of a house in Naples, Fla.\n\nThe ClearSpace-1 mission is due to launch in 2025 to rendezvous with a piece of a Vega rocket. This illustration shows ClearSpace-1 capturing the debris with robotic arms. The mission will aim to drag the rocket part down to burn up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. ClearSpace SA\n\nA circular space economy would represent a paradigm shift toward sustainable space practices, drawing inspiration from circular economy ideas that are gaining traction here on Earth. \u201cCircularity\u201d in this sense refers to waste-management principles calling for the end of life of a product to be designed for the object\u2019s reuse or recycling. The first step is to design spacecraft using materials that minimize pollution and generate less waste. The second is to repair satellites\u2019 broken parts in orbit to extend their life cycles. The third is to recycle materials from defunct satellites for use on new missions, without having to bring the satellites back to Earth. And finally, we must retrieve and reprocess space debris to reduce collision risks and reclaim valuable components.\n\nWe won\u2019t be able to enact a circular space economy without some technological innovations. We don\u2019t currently have techniques to service all spacecraft in orbit, although several companies and space agencies are working on it. We must create technology to extend satellites\u2019 operational lifespans and reduce the need for costly and resource-intensive replacement missions. We need spacecraft that can approach aging satellites and dock with them, using robots to repair, refuel and upgrade them.\n\nSpace exploration also raises fundamental ethical questions about fair resource extraction, ownership and environmental stewardship.\n\nWe\u2019ll also need a way to reuse and recycle satellites when their working lives are over. Currently all satellites become trash when their primary mission ends, and new satellites are built from entirely new materials. It\u2019s a huge waste, much like our junkyards for used cars and other vehicles. Researchers are working on ways to harvest materials from dead spacecraft to integrate into new vehicles and to use techniques to build new satellites out of used parts.\n\nA positive step in this direction is the reusable rocket technology SpaceX is developing. The boosters of their Falcon 9 rockets, for instance, can land vertically after being jettisoned in space after launch, allowing them to fly again. Not only does this save money\u2014recycling boosters reduces the cost of each Falcon 9 launch by up to 30 percent\u2014it generates less trash. But so far SpaceX is the only company or agency launching satellites with reusable rockets. We need more.\n\nThere\u2019s also been movement toward servicing working satellites in orbit. Northrop Grumman\u2019s SpaceLogistics has developed a spacecraft, the Mission Extension Vehicle (MEV), to help aging satellites keep going. In 2020 it successfully docked with the Intelsat 901 satellite, which was running out of fuel, and began using its own thrusters and propellant to maneuver the joined craft, extending the Intelsat\u2019s operational life. A second MEV docked with another Intelsat spacecraft in 2021. When those satellites are ready to be retired, the MEVs can undock and move on to other spacecraft that need their help. Launching an MEV to aid an ailing craft costs about half to a quarter of the price of building and launching an entirely new satellite. In addition to saving money, in-\u00adorbit servicing reduces the frequency of new satellite launches, which in turn minimizes the accumulation of space debris and the greenhouse gas emissions that come with rocket launches.\n\nRemoving debris from orbit is another challenge. Different types of trash require different removal techniques, with many ideas coming from the fishing industry: some strategies use nets, others harpoons, and still others hooks. Each removal technology has limitations and works only for a subset of the objects that need to be fished out of orbital space. It\u2019s also really expensive to retrieve any kind of space trash because anything that is not being actively controlled in space is tumbling. This means that to grab something to remove it, you must either find a way to steady the space detritus or make your debris-removal satellite tumble along with it. Detumbling debris takes a lot of energy, which results in high propellant costs.\n\nJen Christiansen; Source: \u201cSatellite Statistics: Satellite and Debris Population,\u201d Jonathan\u2019s Space Report (data)\n\nNevertheless, some progress has been made. In 2021 a Tokyo-based company, Astroscale, ran the End-\u00adof-\u00adLife Services by Astroscale demonstration (ELSA-d) mission, which launched two satellites: one to simulate a dead spacecraft and a servicer satellite to remove it. The two craft successfully docked in orbit and then released, testing out a critical process for eventual debris removal. The company plans to run more tests with its Active Debris Removal by Astro\u00adscale-\u00adJapan (ADRAS-J) mission, which launched in 2024.\n\nThe European Space Agency (ESA), partnering with start-up ClearSpace, is set to launch its ClearSpace-1 mission in 2028. ClearSpace-1 will use four robotic arms to grab onto the agency\u2019s PROBA-1 satellite and bring it safely out of orbit. The project aims not only to clean up space but also to develop the ability to target larger and more complex pieces of debris.\n\nFinally, more efficient propulsion technology allows spacecraft to use less fuel and last longer on their initial load. Electric propulsion systems, such as ion thrusters and Hall effect thrusters, are newer technologies that offer higher efficiency and fuel economy compared with traditional chemical propulsion. These systems use electric power to ionize propellant and generate thrust, enabling spacecraft to achieve higher velocities and perform precise maneuvers over extended periods. Electric propulsion is already used by many working satellites and will become increasingly common.\n\nAs we design new technology to conserve space, we\u2019d do well to take inspiration from another kind of tech: Indigenous societies\u2019 traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). This kind of TEK emphasizes the importance of harmonious relationships between human activities and the environment. It shows us that we have to see space as an extension of our natural world, where resources must be managed wisely and responsibly.\n\nAn example of applying TEK ideas to modern space activities is a recent collaboration between the ESA and Indigenous groups in Australia to study the impacts of space debris on wildlife habitats. By respecting the wisdom of Indigenous communities, ESA not only advanced their scientific goals but also promoted a sustainable model that can be applied to future space missions.\n\nNew technology alone isn\u2019t enough to fix the space junk problem\u2014we\u2019ll need legal reform, too. The current global space policy is a patchwork of regulations that often lag behind technological advancements and the evolving needs of space activities. SpaceX, for instance, has faced regulatory challenges in deploying its reusable rockets because our laws haven\u2019t caught up with the technology. Fragmented regulations across different countries and regions also lead to inconsistencies and hinder international collaboration. And many existing space policies don\u2019t even address sustainable practices such as in-orbit servicing, space debris mitigation and responsible resource use.\n\nThe European Union is trying to pave the way by integrating sustainability principles into its space policies. The E.U. has streamlined licensing processes for satellite launches and in-orbit operations across member states and has allocated significant funding for research and development on dealing with space debris. The U.S., through its many government agencies, has begun working to streamline the licensing process as well. But most countries are dangerously far behind.\n\nGovernments have a strong hand to play in incentivizing companies to design and develop sustainable space systems. One way to do this would be to adopt what are called extended producer responsibility laws, which require companies to help manage the waste from the technology they produce. Perhaps governments could use a credit system to regulate the amount of space debris the industry is allowed to create. Laws could also incentivize the design, launch and operation of on-orbit recycling centers where aging and defunct satellites could be repurposed.\n\nUltimately the governments that permit spacecraft to be launched are liable for any damage their space objects may cause. So the responsibility for cleaning orbital space falls to governments, but none of them, including Russia, the U.S. or China, are establishing robust markets for space garbage pickup and removal services. Moreover, currently there is no legal mechanism to transfer this liability for damage from one launching state to another, making it complicated to put in place a space salvage law analogous to maritime policy. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space also plays a pivotal role in developing international space law and norms. Its Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines encourage member states to manage space debris and promote sustainable space operations. More than 100 countries have endorsed the guidelines, including the U.S. Yet guidelines are not enforceable laws in and of themselves\u2014they are merely suggestions.\n\nSpace exploration also raises fundamental ethical questions about fair resource extraction, ownership and environmental stewardship. Asteroid mining, for example, presents opportunities for accessing rare minerals and resources, although it also risks destroying the scientific and cultural heritage of celestial bodies. And space mining could destabilize global markets\u2014imagine mining an asteroid made out of platinum. Furthermore, who should be allowed to profit from the resources of asteroids\u2014is it fair for only certain countries, or certain billionaires, to grow even richer and more powerful from space commodities?\n\nOrganizations such as the International Institute of Space Law and the U.N. Office for Outer Space Affairs are trying to develop ethical guidelines for responsible ways to use space resources that emphasize transparency, international cooperation and sustainability. Initiatives such as the Space Sustainability Rating, which aims to certify space missions based on sustainable practices, could encourage companies and nations to act responsibly.\n\nPreserving the space environment for future generations is a moral imperative. In the short term, we must take immediate action to deal with the growing dangers of space junk. We need more funding for debris-tracking and debris-mitigation technologies. We must also start changing how we build and use satellites to waste fewer resources, produce less trash and pollution, and recycle more. A circular space economy is the only way to keep space usable indefinitely.\n\nIn the long term, fostering international cooperation\u2014and international treaties requiring sustainable space practices\u2014is critical. The Inter-\u00adAgency Space Debris Coordination Committee, an intergovernmental organization dedicated to combating the problem of orbital trash, is a promising step. Many space agencies, including NASA, China\u2019s National Space Administration and Roscosmos, are members. The ESA\u2019s Clean Space initiative is another smart approach to reducing space debris through technology development and policy changes.\n\nThe establishment of a circular space economy is not just an option but a necessity for the sustainable future of space exploration. By adopting the principles of reuse, recycling, and efficient resource management, we can lower the risks of space debris collisions, preserve resources, and ensure that outer space remains a viable domain for scientific discovery and commercial innovation. Policymakers, industry leaders, scientists and the global community must embrace a sustainable approach to our activities in Earth orbit, securing its potential for generations to come."
