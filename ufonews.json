One of these endings is the \u201cUFO\u201d Ending which is a running joke that has appeared in many of the series\u2019 entries. While this version of the UFO Ending is slightly different from the original, players will still want to know how to reach this humorous conclusion. This guide will show players how to get the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake.\n\nMore Silent Hill 2 Remake Guides\n\nFull Achievement and Trophy List | How Long Is Silent Hill 2 Remake? | How To Get All Guns & Special Weapons | How to Get the Handgun | How to Get the Shotgun | How to Get the Hunting Rifle | Pyramid Head Boss Fight Guide | Flesh Lip Boss Fight Guide | Abstract Daddy Boss Fight Guide | Eddie Boss Fight Guide | Dual Pyramid Heads Boss Fight Guide | Final Boss Fight Guide | All Number Locks & Keypad Solutions | How To Unlock Every Classic Ending | Secrets Guide | How To Unlock Two New Secret Endings\n\nHow to Get the \u201cUFO\u201d Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake\n\nTo get the UFO Ending, you will first need to beat the game at least once and then go through it all again in New Game+. During New Game+, new items will appear throughout the game, including special ones that are required to get special endings like the UFO one.\n\nYou will need to use the Blue Gem item at designated locations to get the UFO ending. This Gem is found just a little north of the top right corner of Katz and Nathan Street on the east side of South Vale. Look for the blue awning that says \u201cJEWELLERS.\u201d Break the left window to pick up the Blue Gem.\n\nNow, progress through the game as normal but make sure to stop at specific locations and then inspect the Blue Gem. The first location is on the roof of the Saul Street Apartments which you will go to when you are getting the Jukebox button. When you inspect the Gem in the right location, it will glow which means you have successfully checked off the location you are currently at.\n\nThe next place you need to use the Blue Gem is the pier of Rosewater Park.\n\nGet all the way to the start of the Lakeview Hotel section of the game. After getting off the boat used to get across Toluca Lake, use the Gem while on the dock to get it to glow.\n\nMake your way through all of the Lakeview Hotel until you complete the Lakeview Hotel Music Box Puzzle and can now go to Room 312. Instead of putting the Video Tape in the VCR, use the Blue Gem on the left window. This will immediately begin the UFO Ending.\n\nAliens will descend down but it won\u2019t just be them. It isn\u2019t Harry from Silent Hill 1 that gets off the fly saucer-like in the original game, but instead the PlayStation 2 version of James. he tells Remake James that he is nothing but a clone and it\u2019s time to take him home. An alien knocks Remake James out as the creature and PS2 James takes him aboard their spacecraft.\n\nYou can now get the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake.

Gribble, keeps records of sightings around the globe. Since 1995, the centre has kept sighting reports on its website.\n\nBeyond the explained sightings of comets or northern lights, Unidentified Flying Objects are just that, unexplained objects spotted in the sky. Recently, scientists are using the acronym \u201cUAP\u201d (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon) for unexplainable sights or phenomena. NASA established a team in 2022 to study UAP.\n\nIn Canada, Ontario has the highest number of reports at 2,562 in the National UFO Reporting Center database. British Columbia is next with 1,226. Toronto has the highest number of sightings in 2024.\n\nThese numbers are likely due to the population. Ontario has the highest population in Canada at 16,124,116, according to Statistics Canada. British Columbia is next at 5,698,430.\n\nToronto, with a population of 6,431,000 in 2024, has had six UFO sightings reported to the National UFO Reporting Center in 2024.\n\nIn September, someone reported a \u201cnear stationary white changing object\u201d in the city and in July another report indicated there was an \u201coval craft\u201d that floated at an almost helicopter level.\n\nOther reports in the GTA include a recent sighting in Mississauga. On Oct. 10, someone reported and egg-shaped object following an aircraft on a final approach to Pearson Airport.\n\nOn Aug. 31, a person in Burlington claimed to see nine craft that appeared as dots in a delta formation.\n\nThere was a report of an \u201cextremely large triangle\u201d over Clarington on Aug. 29.\n\nIn April, someone spotted a \u201cwhite ball moving very fast \u2013 too fast for a satellite\u201d in Milton.\n\nWhile often ridiculed, UFO sightings are part of Canada\u2019s history.\n\nLast month, The Royal Canadian Mint announced a coin commemorating one of Canada\u2019s most notable UFO sightings. The Langenburg Event, as it came to be known, was a sighting on Sept. 1, 1974 near the town of Langenburg, Saskatchewan.\n\nA farmer reported five saucer-shaped objects hovering just above the ground. He watched as they rose up, emitting a strange vapour and then disappeared into the sky. The RCMP investigated and the incident report noted \u201cfive different distinct circles, caused by something exerting what had to be heavy air or exhaust pressure over the highgrass.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the National UFO Reporting Center, see the website here."

        "article_content": "The surge of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has contributed to unprecedented demand on datacentre infrastructure.\n\nExisting facilities are no longer fit for purpose and AI-ready capacity is in short supply, exacerbated by the existing demand from hyperscalers and cloud providers.\n\nHyperscaler providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft, already consume the vast majority of datacentre capacity in Europe, and are looking to secure even more space to support the expansion of their digital services and outpace competitors. This is increasing the pressure on datacentre developers to increase supply across Europe.\n\nAI technologies, particularly generative AI, require significantly more power than traditional datacentre workloads. For example, the development of an AI training model that looks at thousands of faces to learn what a nose should look like, requires more computational power and energy than a traditional computing environment. In addition, the rising uptake of AI across countries, industries, and functions, is rapidly increasing demand for datacentre space.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) believes AI-powered web searches will boost electricity demand tenfold. By 2026, the IEA expects total datacentre electricity demand to increase from approximately 460 TWh in 2022 to over 1,000 TWh.\n\nDesigning datacentres for AI Datacentre design is also evolving to accommodate AI workloads, due to the need for more processing power compared to generic forms of computing. This generates more heat, which requires a radically different approach to cooling. Datacentre operators are having to redesign their infrastructure to include liquid cooling, to ensure they can handle the higher power densities required for AI technology. This includes installing direct-to-chip or immersed solutions. Datacentres like this will need larger dedicated areas to house the advanced cooling equipment. Given this complexity, many operators are choosing to build completely new liquid-cooled datacentres from scratch. In Europe\u2019s metro markets, where most colocation datacentres are found, there is a lack of power available. This is due to limited grid capacity, sustainability, and political pressure, as datacentre operators compete with residential developers and other commercial users for power. Additionally, the availability of land that\u2019s within easy reach of high-speed network connectivity and within reasonable proximity of datacentres where they have let space is limited. Consequently, where land with power and network is available, it is at a premium and datacentre operators are also looking further afield to find suitable locations. Providers are struggling to keep pace with the demand for datacentre capacity from hyperscalers and cloud providers, and this trend is being exacerbated by the demand from next generation AI. As a result, available datacentre space has plummeted in the largest cities of Europe.\n\nCan the surge in AI demand be accommodated? Existing colocation facilities can to an extent support AI workloads if they can be retrofitted with specialised hardware and cooling equipment. But if, as expected, the use of AI continues to grow, new datacentre capacity will be required to fulfil the demand. This is unlikely to happen at scale in the traditional markets of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin, because power and land availability is increasingly hard to find. To accommodate the requirements created by AI, the industry\u2019s development strategy will have to change. Datacentre operators will need to look outside the European metro markets when seeking locations to develop new capacity. This will lead to the development of smaller, secondary markets in countries such as the UK or France (e.g. Marseille or Lyon), where there may be more power and land available for datacentre purposes. In the UK, this development trend is accelerating, which is encouraging investors, hyperscalers, and datacentre providers to purchase land for AI-ready data centre development. We estimate that at present 56% of the country\u2019s colocation datacentres are located within 30 miles of London, although operators are shifting their focus outside the capital. For example, the datacentre operator Virtus has announced that it has purchased land in Saunderton, north west of London, where they plan to deliver 75MW of capacity for AI applications. Lower latency connectivity will become more important for datacentre providers as inference AI is rolled out given the need to deliver services to users. In the meantime, equipment that powers AI training models are being implemented in datacentres; inference AI is expected to follow."

        "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 On a chilly October night, a few brave souls gathered under the light of the fall\u2019s first full moon in the heart of the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe gaggle of Midwestern tourists was awaiting Anna Surratt, whose mother was hanged as an accomplice in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Though Surratt \u2013 much like her mother \u2013 is long dead, she emerged from the darkness wearing a long, hooded cloak and carrying a lantern to guide the group around Capitol Hill to the spots haunted by her fellow spirits.\n\nSurratt, played by theater actress Victoria Sova, recounted gruesome tales of deaths that took place in and around the country's most vaunted and historic sites.\n\nTaking a ghost tour in the nation's capital brings added resonance and renown to what has become an American pastime: getting spooked at Halloween. Among the ghosts still haunting Washington: Lincoln, who has been spotted wandering the corridors at the White House, as has his 11-year-old son, Willie, who died there in 1862 from typhoid fever. At the U.S. Capitol, where John Quincy Adams suffered a fatal stroke after voting against a resolution, his ghost can be heard late at night yelling \"No!\" and a feline apparition known as Demon Cat often appears to frighten people in the basement.\n\nAt midnight on Halloween, Sova herself said she saw the cat with piercing green eyes racing toward the Supreme Court, a site also reportedly haunted by the phantoms of Confederate prisoners of war.\n\nThe true believers like Sova who lead ghost tours here and across the country say the spooky strolls aren\u2019t just a good way to send a chill down your spine at Halloween, they also teach real local history and boost tourism at sometimes overlooked historic sites. And while ghost tour guides can\u2019t guarantee everyone will encounter a spirit \u2013 though they say many have \u2013 guides promise to provide an entertaining evening for believers and skeptics alike.\n\nDeath befells all, and Sova warned the tourists gathered in Washington one recent night they may not survive the night. They might suffer the same ghastly fate as those doomed to haunt stops on the tour.\n\n\u201cWhoever dies on the hill, stays on the hill,\u201d she warned.\n\nExclusive:Seen any paranormal activity on your Ring device? You could win $100,000\n\nHow ghost tours became America's haunted hobby\n\nParanormal tourism has long been a manifestation of America's fascination with the macabre, according to Rachael Ironside, an associate professor at Robert Gordon University who studies dark tourism. She said the industry traces its roots back to the rise of spiritualism in the late 19th century when many Americans took an interest in seances and mediums, and the first paranormal research centers were founded.\n\nBy the early 2000s, Ironside said, supernatural television shows that featured ordinary people exploring haunted places like \"Ghost Hunters\" helped give rise to the modern ghost tour. Frankie Harris said it was around that time he and his wife Kim decided to launch their ghost tour company, Amerighost Tours, in Nashville.\n\nAt the time, Harris recalled, so few people knew what ghost tours were that he was once stopped by a police officer who wanted to know why he was telling ghost stories outside a church so late at night. Over the past two decades, they've expanded to Louisville, Kentucky, and Washington and participants have grown more devoted.\n\n\u201cPeople that do ghost tours, it becomes kind of a hobby for them. They often will take the ghost tour in any city that they visit,\u201d he said.\n\nHarris\u2019 tourgoers follow actors in Victorian dress on foot to haunted sites around Nashville including the Ryman Auditorium \u2013 former home to the Grand Ole Opry and the ghost of music legend Hank Williams Sr., according to lore. In Louisville, they are regaled with tales of poltergeists like The Lady in Blue at the old Seelbach Hotel, once frequented by F. Scott Fitzgerald and Al Capone.\n\n\u201cGhost stories really are sort of sneaky history tours, in a way,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat's the 'Scariest House in America'?HGTV aims to find out\n\nGhost tours go cut-throat for tourism dollars\n\nParanormal tourism is a multimillion industry in some cities and has allowed historic facilities like abandoned hospitals, schools and prisons to rebrand themselves, \u201cto remain intact or to receive much-needed funding and renovations,\u201d according to a 2020 study published in Cornell Hospitality Quarterly.\n\nWhen Mike Vitka first started working for Spellbound Tours in 2000, he said they had just one competitor in Salem, Massachusetts. Now, he estimates there are more than 80 tour operators in the city, which draws more than a million visitors each year.\n\n\u201cIt's very, very busy now,\" Vitka said. \"Salem, it's gone from being a day trip, an afterthought of a Boston trip, to something that people from around the globe plan for their whole vacation.\u201d\n\nVitka said he leads tours detailing the history of the witch trials, where 200 women were accused of witchcraft, and 20 were executed, the city\u2019s \u201cthriving vampire community,\u201d serial killers like the Boston Strangler, who visited Salem, and \u201cterrifying true ghost stories,\" many of which he says come from personal experience.\n\nCompetition can be fierce. Several tour guides including Vitka and Harris told USA TODAY they have to compete with national chains moving into their market and even poaching stories from local tours.\n\n\u201cOur approach with that is just to ignore it and just do our thing and just focus on our customer,\u201d said Harris. \u201cBut if you talk to people around the country, you'll learn of these various feuds and things and lawsuits and all of that.\u201d\n\nHow ghost tours handle dark history\n\nThe guides that spoke with USA TODAY stressed that their tours are thoroughly researched, but Ironside said research has shown the accuracy of ghost tours can vary, and over time, the stories of real crimes or tragedies can get exaggerated for entertainment.\n\n\u201cIt can be a compelling way to engage people in the history of a place that maybe ordinarily wouldn't engage with that topic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time, there are ethical issues.\u201d\n\nAcross the South, for example, ghost tours held on plantations can turn the horrific realities of slavery into titillating tales, according to Tiya Miles, author of \"Tales from the Haunted South: Dark Tourism and Memories of Slavery from the Civil War Era.\" But Miles said when stories are handled with care, they can illuminate the plight of people marginalized during their lifetimes, including people of color, women, and people with disabilities.\n\n\u201cThat's something that ghost stories can do, that perhaps other kinds of cultural productions or creations can't do,\u201d she said.\n\nVitka said some Salem locals can be hesitant to embrace the city\u2019s history, either because they\u2019re frustrated by the throngs of tourists or because they don\u2019t want to promote its violent past. But he said, \u201cThe best way to deal with the witch trials is to embrace the history so we can learn from it, and something awful like that doesn't happen again.\u201d\n\nPray or move?40% of surveyed Americans experience 'unexplained' phenomena in homes\n\nWhy do people go on ghost tours?\n\nUnlike a haunted house or a horror movie, ghost tours aren\u2019t necessarily designed to raise your blood pressure with jump scares. As a result, the tours don\u2019t always attract thrill seekers, but people interested in the supernatural, history buffs, true crime fanatics, families and even skeptics, Ironside said.\n\nFor some, the tours can also be a spiritual experience. Lopaka Kapanui said he became fascinated with ghost tours when he took one in the late 1990s and saw many similarities to the lessons on Hawaiian culture and spirituality his mother had taught him growing up.\n\nKapanui now runs the Mysteries of Hawaii tour with his wife and shares stories of Hawaii\u2019s journey from kingdom to state and its melting pot of spiritual practices. He said he ends each tour with a prayer asking spirits to make sure everyone gets home safely.\n\n\u201cIt's my favorite part because at the end while I'm doing the prayer in Hawaiian, I get to see family members and friends huddle close together, hug each other, hold hands,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that makes me feel good.\u201d\n\nSo, will I see a ghost on a ghost tour?\n\nMany ghost tour operators say they got into the business because they had a paranormal experience of their own, but how likely you are to see a ghost on tour depends who you ask. Kapanui said he\u2019ll sometimes see a deceased relative \u2013 of his or of someone taking his tour.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen ... in the past, what these spirits have done is basically hijack the whole thing until I say something,\u201d he said.\n\nA 2023 IPSOS poll found 39% of respondents said they believe in ghosts and about 25% said they\u2019ve seen or been in the presence of a ghost. Ultimately, Ironside said, it may not really matter if a ghost appears on a tour or if they exist at all. What keeps people coming back over and over, she thinks, is the mere chance they might see something they can\u2019t quite explain.\n\nAt the U.S. Capitol, a set of marble steps is inexplicably slippery, and Sova said the phenomenon has caused several reporters to fall and break bones \u2013 revenge so it goes, for the killing of William P. Taulbee, a lobbyist and former congressman whose long-running feud with journalist Charles Kincaid turned deadly in 1890.\n\nTensions between the men escalated over Kincaid's scandalous story exposing the Kentucky congressman\u2019s affair until the reporter fatally shot Taulbee on the steps. The blood stains can still be seen to this day.\n\n\"With so many bloody and gory deaths, duels, wars, and battles, it makes you think,\" Sova said, \"how much of this marble city is just drenched in blood?\""

Green spots like those observed in the Wallace Butte abrasion are common in ancient \u201cred beds\u201d on Earth and form when liquid water percolates through the sediment before it hardens to rock, kicking off a chemical reaction that transforms oxidized iron to its reduced (Fe2+) form, resulting in a greenish hue. On Earth, microbes are sometimes involved in this iron reduction reaction. However, green spots can also result from decaying organic matter that creates localized reducing conditions. Interactions between sulfur and iron can also create iron-reducing conditions without the involvement of microbial life."

Let\u2019s dive into the details.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: specs\n\nSpecs iPhone 16 Pro Pixel 9 Pro Size 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm (5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches) 152.8 x 72 x 8.5mm (6.02 x 2.83 x 0.32 inches) Weight 199 grams (7.03 ounces) 199 grams (7.02 ounces) Screen 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR OLED 1206 x 2622 pixels ProMotion with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate Dolby Vision, 2,000 nits brightness 460 pixels per inch 6.3-inch OLED 1280 x 2856 pixels 120Hz dynamic refresh rate 3,000 nits peak brightness 495 pixels per inch Operating system iOS 18 Android 14, upgradable to Android 15 RAM and storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 8GB RAM 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 16GB RAM Processor Apple A18 Pro Six-core CPU Six-core GPU Google Tesnor G4 Octa-core CPU Mali-G715 GPU Camera Rear: 48-megapixels primary, f/1.8, 1/1.28\u2033, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 120\u00b0 FOV 12MP telephoto, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Front: 12MP, f/1.9, 1/3.6\u2033 Rear: 50MP primary, f/1.7, 1/1.31\u2033, PDAF, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/1.7, 123\u00b0 FOV 48MP telephoto, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Front: 42MP, f/2.2, PDAF Video Rear: 4K, up to 120 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Rear: 8K, up to 30fps\n\n4K, up to 60 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, tri-band Bluetooth 5.3 Wi-Fi 7, tri-band Bluetooth 5.3 Ports USB-C Gen 3.2 DisplayPort USB-C Gen 3.2 Water resistance IP68 (maximum depth of 6m up to 30 minutes) IP68 (maximum depth of 1.5m up to 30 minutes) Battery & charging 3,582 mAh 30W fast charging 25W wireless charging via MagSafe 15W Qi2 wireless charging 4,700 mAh 27W fast charging 21W wireless charging with Pixel Stand 12W Qi wireless charging Colors Black Titanium,\n\nWhite Titanium,\n\nNatural Titanium,\n\nDesert Titanium Porcelain,\n\nRose Quartz,\n\nHazel,\n\nObsidian Price Starts at $999 Starts at $999\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: design and display\n\nBoth phones have undergone subtle changes from their predecessors, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pixel 8 Pro. Unlike previous years, both now feature near-identical specs sheets to their bigger siblings, and they both offer the same flagship experience in a smaller, more ergonomic size.\n\nThe big difference is in style: Apple uses titanium in the build of the iPhone 16 Pro, which feels lighter and more premium than the Pixel 9 Pro, which uses aluminum, but comes in more vibrant colors. Even though they weigh the same 199 grams, the iPhone 16 Pro feels slightly lighter than the Pixel 9 Pro thanks to the titanium build.\n\nThe choice of titanium also means the iPhone 16 Pro features more muted colors than the Pixel 9 Pro. The four titanium color choices are beautiful, but none are quite as vibrant as the Rose Quartz Pixel 9 Pro. The pink color choice means your Pixel 9 Pro can stand out, although there are more traditional color choices available if Pink isn\u2019t your preference.\n\nMeasuring 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm, the iPhone 16 Pro is 3mm shorter, 0.5mm narrower, and 0.25mm thinner than the Pixel 9 Pro, but they feel virtually identical in the hand. The iPhone 16 Pro also has a Camera Control button on the right side,and the Action button on the left, while the Pixel 9 Pro has a mmWave antenna cutout on the top, even in countries where mmWave isn\u2019t available.\n\nBoth phones have a 6.3-inch OLED display, with a dynamic refresh rate of up to 120Hz. The Pixel 9 Pro display is slightly higher resolution, resulting in a higher pixel density (495 pixels per inch versus 460 ppi), but the difference is minimal. The Pixel 9 Pro has a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, while the iPhone 16 Pro doesn\u2019t get as dark at 2,000 nits. However, there\u2019s functionally little difference in the quality or brightness of the displays during day-to-day use.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro has a slightly better display, but there\u2019s no denying how good the titanium build on the iPhone 16 Pro feels in the hand. This one\u2019s a stalemate.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: performance and battery\n\nRecent Pixel devices have been plagued by problems with Google\u2019s Tensor GPU, and while Google has stuck with its chipset, the Tensor G4 chip in the Pixel 9 Pro is vastly improved. It\u2019s designed with performance and AI in mind and fixes many of the problems in the previous generation, including poor battery life and overheating. It\u2019s paired with a whopping 16GB of RAM inside the Pixel 9 Pro, which results in fast performance that left us impressed.\n\nIn comparison, the iPhone 16 Pro is powered by the new Apple A18 Pro chipset that\u2019s designed with performance, battery life, and yes, AI, in mind. Compared to the A17 Pro chipset, it offers up to 15% faster CPU performance, 20% faster graphics performance, and 2x faster ray tracing. The neural processing unit (NPU) performance is very similar, but the improved heat dissipation on the iPhone 16 Pro means it\u2019ll be harder to overheat your iPhone.\n\nThat\u2019s what all the numbers say, but as we discovered in our iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro reviews, both phones offer excellent performance in most conditions. The A18 Pro chipset inside the iPhone 16 Pro is faster than the Tensor G4 and more likely to handle future use cases, but neither phone disappoints in the experience offered today.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro features a battery capacity of around 3,582mAh while the Pixel 9 Pro has a much larger 4,700mAh capacity. However, the tight integration of hardware and software means the iPhone 16 Pro can have a smaller technical capacity and deliver slightly better battery life than the Pixel 9 Pro. In our testing, Apple\u2019s flagship lasts up to two hours longer, but both phones offer all-day battery life with some juice to spare.\n\nBoth phones offer \u201cfast\u201d charging that is among the slowest in the industry, and both phone makers have opted to use their own standard for faster wireless charging. The iPhone 16 Pro uses MagSafe for 25-watt wireless charging, while the Pixel 9 Pro requires the Pixel Stand to achieve 21W. However, both also support the Qi standard, with the iPhone 16 Pro offering up to 15W speeds when charging with Qi2 and the Pixel 9 Pro being capable of 12W charging when connected to a Qi charger.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is very similar to the Pixel 9 Pro, but offers slightly better battery life and overall performance. The Tensor G4 is no slouch \u2014 and vastly improved over previous years \u2014 but Apple still holds the lead.\n\nWinner: Apple iPhone 16 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: cameras\n\nBoth phones use a triple-camera setup and advanced algorithms to capture photos at a variety of focal lengths. The Pixel 9 Pro has better hardware on paper, but each phone has its pros and cons. Google has a slight advantage in still photography and software features, but the iPhone 16 Pro is better for creators and anyone focused on video.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro has a 50-megapixel main camera, a 48MP ultrawide camera, and a 48MP periscope telephoto camera that offers up to 5x zoom. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 Pro uses a 48MP main camera (with the Fusion branding) that captures high-resolution 24MP photos by default. There\u2019s also a 48MP ultrawide camera with a smaller f/2.2 aperture and a 12MP periscope telephoto camera that also offers up to 5x zoom.\n\nThere are many hardware similarities between these two cameras, but it\u2019s in the wider feature set where they diverge. The Pixel 9 Pro comes with features like Add Me \u2014 which makes it easy to include everyone in a group shot, even the photographer \u2014 Auto Frame in the Magic Editor, Zoom Enhance to capture more detail at higher zoom lengths, and Reimagine to help you reimagine photos using generative AI.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro also comes with a slate of camera features, although they\u2019re more geared toward creators. The Camera Control button makes it easy to launch the camera, swipe through different functions, and zoom in or out of a photo or video. The camera control button will also enable Vision Intelligence features later this year, offering a similar experience to Google Lens, where you can point the camera at something and learn more about it straightaway.\n\nThe upgrade of the ultrawide camera to 48MP offers far more detail and better color reproduction. The revamped Photography Styles allow you to tweak and refine your photos before you take them. There\u2019s also the ability to take 4K video portraits at 120 frames per second (fps), Dolby Vision recording, and improvements to audio recording. Audio Mix allows you to choose from four different styles and edit the audio in a video to match this professional style.\n\nBoth phones take fantastic photos, and personal preference will play into this. The iPhone 16 Pro ekes out a win, however, thanks to better photographic styles and video recording.\n\nWinner: Apple iPhone 16 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: software and updates\n\nBoth companies have made strong promises about software and updates, with Google promising seven years of security and software updates for the Pixel 9 Pro. At the same time, Apple makes no guarantees, but its phones have usually been supported for just as long, if not longer.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro launched on Android 14, but can be updated to Android 15 after the recent launch. The update for the Pixel 9 Pro brings a host of new features, including the ability to hide sensitive apps and improvements in theft protection, the ability to generate passkeys, and App Pairing. This last feature allows you to save combinations of two apps and launch them with a single tap.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro, meanwhile, ushers in iOS 18, which introduces one of the biggest overhauls to the iPhone experience. If you\u2019re an Android user, many of the new features in iOS 18 will feel familiar, because it\u2019s the closest that the iPhone has ever come to replicating the Android experience.\n\nSome of the biggest iOS 18 features include a customizable home screen \u2014 you can finally move apps wherever you want \u2014 a customizable control center, a new private folder for your apps, and the ability to lock apps behind a paywall. There are also huge overhauls of Apple Photos, new features in iMessage, support for the RCS standard for messaging, a new Passwords manager, and much more. It\u2019s a huge overhaul of the iPhone experience.\n\nBoth companies are also betting big on AI. Google dedicated much of its Pixel event to showcasing the power of Gemini as your voice assistant. There are new tools for creating and editing images, custom weather reports, a new screenshots app, and many more features that leverage Generative AI to usher in a host of new features.\n\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 16 Pro also bets big on AI, but takes a different approach. Apple Intelligence powers the revamped Siri, but it isn\u2019t launching until later this month. The full rollout of the new Apple Intelligence features won\u2019t be available until early next year, and while features like Apple Intelligence Summaries are some of the best use cases for AI, it\u2019ll take six months from launch for the iPhone 16 Pro to get the full suite of AI features.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel 9 Pro comes with one year of Gemini Advanced for free (after which, it\u2019s $20 per month), while the Apple Intelligence features on the iPhone 16 Pro are entirely free \u2014 except for the ChatGPT integration, which uses your existing subscription \u2014 although Apple may choose to charge for some features in the future.\n\nBoth phones focus on AI, and while Apple Intelligence has a lot of promise, the delay in launch means the Pixel 9 Pro offers better overall software and AI features right now.\n\nWinner: Pixel 9 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: price and availability\n\nBoth phones cost $999 for 128GB of storage, and each charges a $100 premium for the 256GB version. The Pixel 9 Pro costs $1,219 for the 512GB and $1,449 for the 1TB models, while the iPhone 16 Pro costs $1,299 and $1,499, respectively.\n\nThings get a little confusing when you consider the Pixel 9 Pro colors, however. The Porcelain and Hazel colors only come with up to 512GB of storage, while the Rose Quartz model is bizarrely only available with 256GB of storage. If you want the top storage, you have to go for the Obsidian (aka Black) color.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is far simpler. The four titanium color choices \u2014 Natural Titanium, White Titanium, Black Titanium, and the hero, Desert Titanium \u2014 are available in all storage options.\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: verdict\n\nTwo similar phones, from two companies that you\u2019ve heard of. This sums up this comparison, at least on paper. Once you dive in, you realize that the differences are subtle, but they do exist.\n\nBoth phones weigh the same, but the iPhone 16 Pro feels lighter. The cameras are very similar, and each camera excels in different ways. Even the software is fairly similar, with iOS 18 taking great strides to offer Android-esque levels of customization.\n\nWhich smartphone is best depends on which platform you prefer. If you prefer iOS, then buy the iPhone 16 Pro. For Android lovers, the Pixel 9 Pro is a fantastic smartphone. If you want to make the switch in either direction, there\u2019s no better time, but if you\u2019re thinking of switching to Android, it\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel 9 Pro is a great alternative, but the OnePlus 12 is the best Android alternative to the iPhone."

It was incredibly well-built, drop-dead gorgeous, was built around a spectacular OLED display, and at the time, landed on our ranking of the best laptops you could buy. I was a little nervous when HP announced its rebranding, doing away with the Spectre line and introducing the OmniBook is its new brand for its entire consumer lineup.\n\nThe OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is the Spectre\u2019s true replacement, and when I pulled it out of the box, I was a little relieved. It\u2019s built around Intel\u2019s latest Lunar Lake chipset, and that needed testing, but the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 shares many of the same great characteristics as its predecessors. It\u2019s not as long-lasting as some other Lunar Lake laptops in terms of battery life, but it\u2019s still a great 2-in-1 option.\n\nSpecs and configuration\n\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 Dimensions 12.35 x 8.51 x 0.59 inches Weight 2.97 pounds Display 14.0-inch 16:10 2.8K (2880 x 1800) OLED, 120Hz CPU Intel Core Ultra 5 226V\n\nIntel Core Ultra 7 256V\n\nIntel Core Ultra 7 258V\n\nIntel Core Ultra 9 288V GPU Intel Arc 130V\n\nIntel Arc 140V Memory 16GB LPDDR5X RAM\n\n32GB LPDDR5X RAM Storage 512TB M.2 NVMe SSD\n\n1TB M.2 NVMe SSD\n\n2TB M.2 NVMe SSD Ports 2 x USB-C with Thunderbolt 4\n\n1 x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2\n\n1 x 3.5mm headphone jack Camera 9MP with infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 7 Bluetooth Bluetooth 5.4 Battery 64 watt-hour Operating system Windows 11 Price $ 1,450+\n\nHP\u2019s prices vary from sale to sale, and so you have to check regularly to see what the actual price is when you\u2019re ready to make your purchase. The OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is no different. The base model with a Core Ultra 5 226V chipset, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and the standard 14-inch 2.8K OLED display has a list price $1,450 but is currently on sale for $1,100 at the time of writing. My review unit with a Core Ultra 7 258V, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD is on sale for $1,400, down from a list price of $1,750. And then the high-end configuration with a Core Ultra 9 288V and a 2TB SSD lists for $2,080 but is on sale right now at $1,730.\n\nIf you compare the list prices to a competitor like the Asus Zenbook S 14, another Lunar Lake laptop, the HP is more expensive. The Asus costs $1,399 for a Core Ultra 7 258V, 32GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 14-inch OLED display. The equivalent HP list price would be a more expensive $1,700, but the sale price is slightly less at $1,350. And then consider the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x, which is just $1,199 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chipset, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 14.5-inch OLED display. With 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, it\u2019s $1,313. That\u2019s less than the HP\u2019s sale prices.\n\nThe bottom line is that the OmniBook Ultra Flip tends to run on the more expensive side, though the sale prices make it more competitive.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Spectre x360 14 was an awesome 2-in-1. It had a gorgeous aesthetic, was solidly built, and featured some useful features like USB-C ports notch of the back corners that allowed plugging in and keep cables neatly out of the way. The OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 has a slightly less ostentatious design, but it maintains what was best about the Spectre. And it\u2019s a strong competitor against laptops like the Zenbook S14, the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x, and the Yoga Slim 7i that has a larger 15.3-inch display.\n\nTo begin with, the notches are still there and remain just as functional. The build quality is incredibly solid, with no bending, flexing, or twisting in the lid, keyboard deck, or chassis. The hinge is just slightly too firm to open the lid with one hand, but that\u2019s because it has to hold everything in place in clamshell, tent, media, and tablet modes. Simply put, the OmniBook exudes quality just like the best premium laptops.\n\nAnd while the OmniBook doesn\u2019t have the same colorful accents as the old Spectre, its all-black color way is just as attractive. The edges are more rounded, which is not only a good look but also helps the OmniBook being more comfortable to hold as a tablet. I\u2019ve mentioned a few other very nice laptops I\u2019ve reviewed lately, and the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is as nicely design as any of them.\n\nIt\u2019s also just as portable. It\u2019s thin at 0.59 inches and light at 2.97 pounds. Its display bezels are reasonably small, especially for a 360-degree convertible 2-in-1.\n\nKeyboard and touchpad\n\nI\u2019ve long been a fan of HP\u2019s keyboards, particularly those in the Specre lineup. The keycaps are large with highly legible lettering, and there\u2019s a ton of key spacing. The switches are light and snappy, giving a precise feel. I found the OmniBook\u2019s keyboard to be every bit as comfortable as Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard, my other favorite, for long-form writing \u2014 such as this review. HP gave the function keys a gray color and it helps them stand out, but that does detract a little from the otherwise cohesive aesthetic. The power button is a light-blue color with a bright LED, and it helps identify it but, again, it kind of stands out a little too much.\n\nEqually excellent is the large touchpad that takes up most of the available space on the palm rest. Not only is it large enough, it\u2019s also a haptic feedback touchpad that\u2019s responsive and supports clicking across the entire surface. It doesn\u2019t have the same kind of Force Click functionality of Apple\u2019s Force Touch haptic touchpad, but it\u2019s still very good and welcome here.\n\nThe display is pen- and touch-enabled, of course, and everything works as it should. If you want a laptop that can convert to a tablet for writing and drawing on the display, then the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is a great example of the form.\n\nConnectivity and webcam\n\nConnectivity is pretty light for a 14-inch laptop. There are just three USB-C ports \u2014 two of them with Thunderbolt 4, and one of them provides power. It\u2019s nice that two are tucked away in the notches, but I would have liked to see at least on legacy port and an SD card reader. At least there\u2019s a 3.5mm audio jack, which Dell dropped on the XPS 13. Wireless connectivity is up-to-date.\n\nThe webcam is a high-res 9MP model with an infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello facial recognition. There\u2019s also a fingerprint reader in the power button. This is as good a time as any to mention that the OmniBook has a fast enough neural processing unit (NPU) to power Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+ PC AI initiative. Today, it supports the enhanced Microsoft Studio Effects software, which includes AI-assisted background blur and replace, filters, and auto framing. HP\u2019s own AI Companion software is also on its way, which will support a variety of on-device features under the rubrics Discover, Analyze, and Perform that apply AI to getting intelligence assistance using the laptop, analyzing files, and optimizing performance.\n\nDisplay and audio\n\nThe OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 has one display option: a 2.8K (2880 x 1800) OLED panel running at up to 120Hz. Out of the box, it\u2019s awesome, with OLED\u2019s usual inky blacks and dynamic colors.\n\nMy colorimeter agreed. It\u2019s bright at 385 nits, although several OLED displays I\u2019ve reviewed recently are brighter. The Surface Pro 11\u2018s panel is an example at 533 nits. The OmniBook\u2019s colors are wide at 100% of sRGB, 95% of AdobeRGB, and 100% of DCI-P3, with a color accuracy of Delta-E 0.67, which is excellent. The Surface Pro 11\u2019s display is less colorful at 100%, 85%, and 97%, respectively, and its accuracy was around the same at 0.74.\n\nReally, there\u2019s nothing to complain about with this display. You\u2019ll love it. Dual downward-firing speakers pump out loud audio with some distortion at full volume, and with crisp mids and highs but little bass. It\u2019s pretty typical.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is the latest laptop I\u2019ve reviewed running Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake chipset. Specifically, it\u2019s the Core Ultra 7 258V, a Series 2 chipset running at 17 watts. As such, it competes most directly against Intel\u2019s previous 15-watt Core Ultra U-series, but in practice it\u2019s the most immediate replacement for the 28-watt Core Ultra H-series processors.\n\nOverall, Lunar Lake has shown itself to be faster than the U-series, which was also aimed at efficiency, and in some cases to be faster in single-core tasks than the H-series while around the same speed in multi-core. We see that with the OmniBook compared to the Spectre x360 14 running that Core Ultra 7 155H. Notably, the OmniBook is slower than laptops running Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X chipsets, another efficiency-focused lineup. And then the Apple M3 has much faster single-core performance than all these laptops to go with very good multi-core performance.\n\nThe bottom line is that the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is plenty fast for demanding productivity users. Its Intel Arc 140V graphics are faster than its predecessor, but not as fast as entry-level discrete GPUs. So, that means it won\u2019t offer any advantages for creators or gamers.\n\nCinebench R24\n\n(single/multi) Geekbench 6\n\n(single/multi) Handbrake\n\n(seconds) HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V / Intel Arc 140V) 116 / 598 2483 / 10725 99 HP Spectre x360 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 155H / Intel Arc) 102 / 485 2176 / 11980 93 Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V / Intel Arc 140V) 109 / 630 2485 / 10569 88 Asus Zenbook S 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V / Intel Arc 140V) 112 / 452 2738 / 10734 113 HP OmniBook X\n\n(Snapdragon X Elite / Adreno) 101 / 749 2377 / 13490 N/A Asus ProArt PX13\n\n(Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / RTX 4050) 116 / 897 2710 / 14696 54 MacBook Air\n\n(M3) 141 / 601 3102 / 12078 109\n\nBattery life\n\nAs I\u2019ve stressed in each of my Lunar Lake laptop reviews, efficiency is the primary goal of this round of Intel\u2019s chipsets. As we see above, performance doesn\u2019t stand out, so battery life becomes more important. In part, that\u2019s because of the excellent efficiency of Apple Silicon, with the M3 chipset being both fast and efficient.\n\nHere, we see that the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is a lot more efficient than the Spectre x360 14, especially in web browsing. It\u2019s not quite as efficient as Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i and the Zenbook S 14, and the Qualcomm laptops are stronger as well.\n\nThe OmniBook is held back a bit by its 64-watt-hour battery, which isn\u2019t huge, and it also sports a high-res, 120Hz OLED display. That also doesn\u2019t help. And while it\u2019s not as good as some others, it\u2019s still a lot more efficient than most Intel Meteor Lake laptops. That means that while it can\u2019t keep up with Apple\u2019s M3, it will still likely get through a day\u2019s work with moderate productivity workflows.\n\nWeb browsing Video Cinebench R24 HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V) 11 hours, 5 minutes 15 hours, 46 minutes 2 hours, 14 minutes HP Spectre x360 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 155H) 7 hours, 9 minutes 14 hours, 22 minutes N/A Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V) 14 hours, 16 minutes 17 hours, 31 minutes 2 hours, 15 minutes Asus ExpertBook P5\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V) 8 hours, 54 minutes 16 hours, 29 minutes 2 hours, 15 minutes Asus Zenbook S 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V) 16 hours, 47 minutes 18 hours, 35 minutes 3 hours, 33 minutes Microsoft Surface Laptop\n\n(Snapdragon X Elite X1E-80-100) 14 hours, 21 minutes 22 hours, 39 minutes N/A HP Omnibook X\n\n(Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100) 13 hours, 37 minutes 22 hours, 4 minutes 1 hour, 52 minutes Asus Vivobook S 15\n\n(Snapdragon X Plus) 13 hours, 10 minutes 16 hours, 19 minutes N/A Asus ProArt PX13\n\n(Ryzen AI 9 HX 370) 8 hours, 7 minutes 11 hours, 12 minutes 1 hour, 12 minutes Apple MacBook Air\n\n(Apple M3) 19 hours, 38 minutes 19 hours, 39 minutes 3 hours, 27 minutes\n\nA worthy successor to one of our favorite 2-in-1s\n\nThe Spectre x360 14 was a great laptop, maybe the best example of the 360-degree convertible 2-in-1. With HP\u2019s rebranding, I was wondering how much else would change with the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t have to worry too much.\n\nThere\u2019s really not a lot to dislike about the OmniBook. It gets very good battery life, has a gorgeous OLED display, and it look and feels great. Its performance isn\u2019t the best, but it\u2019s fast enough, and its keyboard and touchpad are excellent. It\u2019s most attractive, though, at its sale prices."
