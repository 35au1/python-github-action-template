Kristen Gillibrand, who chairs the subcommittee on emerging threats and capabilities and who helped establish the Pentagon's UFO-hunting office, told the website that the hearing would likely be held in November.\n\nWhen it comes to his own beliefs about or experiences with extraterrestrials, the one-time contender for Kamala Harris' running mate fell short of answering definitively.\n\n\"I get these questions all the time,\" Kelly said. \"People think as I've been to space, maybe I have this special insight, or maybe I've seen something.\"\n\n\"While I've spent time orbiting the Earth,\" he continued, \"I haven't.\"\n\nIt's far from a smoking gun, but a senator and former astronaut saying the US should be paying closer attention to UFOs almost certainly carries more credibility than an ex-military official who claims the Department of Defense is hoarding alien tech.\n\nMore on UFOs: Government Whistleblower Says There Was a Secret Pentagon Program to \"Trap\" UFOs"

        "source": "VentureBeat",
        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nUniphore, the global technology company known for its conversational AI and automation solutions, is taking a step towards simplifying how enterprises develop retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications. The company today announced the launch of X-Stream, a new layer in its core data and AI platform that enables knowledge-as-a-service and brings together powerful tools, connectors and controls for enterprises to mobilize their multimodal datasets for grounded, domain-specific AI applications.\n\nAt its core, what X-Stream gives enterprises is a unified and open architecture to combine all the fragmented steps of preparing AI-ready data into a seamless process \u2014 essentially serving as a one-stop solution and eliminating the need to use multiple tools across the stack.\n\n\u201cWith X-Stream, customers can fine-tune their data, convert it into AI-ready knowledge and seamlessly feed it into Uniphore\u2019s industry-specific, production-ready small language models or build their own. Our data scientists and engineers, drawing on years of experience, have solved for accuracy and hallucinations, ensuring safety and guiding customers towards AI sovereignty,\u201d Umesh Sachdev, the CEO of the company, told VentureBeat.\n\nSolving the data problem for RAG\n\nWith the rise of generative AI, the idea of RAG, where AI uses information from a specified set of databases and sources to provide accurate answers to complex questions, has become quite prevalent. Most enterprises today are racing to build dedicated RAG-based search and chat apps that could use their internal knowledge base to provide hallucination-free responses and ultimately drive efficiencies across different functions.\n\nHowever, when it comes to building (and scaling) such apps, things tend to get a little tricky \u2014 especially on the data front.\n\nIn almost every case of RAG, the information that an organization wants to use is spread across different sources and formats, from structured tables to unstructured text conversations, documents and videos. To get all this information together, the company has to cobble up several components and use data connectors/ETL tools (like Fivetran) to connect to their respective data warehouses, ERP, HCMs, internal apps etc.\n\nOnce the information is connected, they have to enable RAG flow by chunking the data, converting it into embeddings and storing them in a vector database using tools like Milvus, Weaviate or Pinecone. Then, to improve accuracy, they potentially add a graph RAG capability like Neo4j.\n\nAll these steps and tools, and then some more, add up very quickly and make it a hard stack to manage and operate. As a result, the project ends up taking months to mature into a scalable gen AI app.\n\n\u201cWe have been hearing from enterprise data leaders that they want a more efficient way to drive knowledge transformation from their own data sets across voice, video and text \u2013 instead of using traditional data platforms or libraries,\u201d Sachdev said.\n\nTo address these data gaps, Uniphore has introduced X-Stream, a unified and open architecture that brings all necessary tools and controls to one place.\n\nThe offering ingests multimodal data from over 200 sources and makes it AI-ready by running intelligent merging and transformation jobs. Once the initial processing is complete, it parses and chunks the data, converts it into embeddings and stores them in a vector database, assisting data teams in providing relevant data to AI teams, specifically for feeding Uniphore\u2019s industry-specific small models or their own for RAG and fine-tuning use cases.\n\nBut that\u2019s not it.\n\nX-Stream also generates knowledge graphs, where context and reasoning are needed, and creates synthetic data to fine-tune models specific to particular use cases or industries. Plus, it provides evidence management capabilities like factuality checks and chunk attribution to enhance trust in AI.\n\nThis essentially gives teams a complete solution to enhance their entire AI pipeline, from data preparation to final output. This allows for the development of production-grade RAG apps much faster.\n\n\u201cX-Stream is distinct for two reasons: it draws from Uniphore\u2019s 16 years of experience working with a variety of unstructured data across voice, video and text, and provides a unified and open platform capability that caters to a broad range of enterprise AI needs,\u201d Sachdev added.\n\nSignificant value promised\n\nWhile X-Stream is new, Sachdev noted that its ability to optimize AI and data components can drive up to 8x faster deployment for domain-specific gen AI apps that use in-house data and meet the highest quality, compliance and governance standards.\n\n\u201cUniphore offers a usage-based pricing model, and customers typically see a 4x-6x return on investment in weeks from going live,\u201d he noted.\n\nNotably, some of X-Stream\u2019s data capabilities are also provided by hyperscalers and startups, including Amazon (with Sagemaker), Tonic AI and Unstructured.io. It will be interesting how the new offering scales, especially as more enterprises adopt generative AI to power their internal and external use cases. Uniphore works with more than 1,500 companies, including DHL, Accenture and General Insurance.\n\nAccording to Gartner, throughout 2025, 30% of generative AI projects will be abandoned after proof of concept due to poor data quality, inadequate risk controls or escalating costs."

        "article_content": "A new algorithm tested on NASA\u2019s Perseverance Rover on Mars may lead to better forecasting of hurricanes, wildfires, and other extreme weather events that impact millions globally.\n\nGeorgia Tech Ph.D. student Austin P. Wright is first author of a paper that introduces Nested Fusion. The new algorithm improves scientists\u2019 ability to search for past signs of life on the Martian surface.\n\nThis innovation supports NASA\u2019s Mars 2020 mission. In addition, scientists from other fields working with large, overlapping datasets can use Nested Fusion\u2019s methods for their studies.\n\nWright presented Nested Fusion at the 2024 International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2024) where it was a runner-up for the best paper award. KDD is widely considered the most prestigious conference for knowledge discovery and data mining research.\n\n\u201cNested Fusion is really useful for researchers in many different domains, not just NASA scientists,\u201d said Wright. \u201cThe method visualizes complex datasets that can be difficult to get an overall view of during the initial exploratory stages of analysis.\u201d\n\nImage Figure showing how Nested Fusion learns latent structures at high resolution to produce distributions at greater impact. Above graphic focuses on the PIXL instrument the Perseverance Rover uses to scan Mars' surface.\n\nNested Fusion combines datasets with different resolutions to produce a single, high-resolution visual distribution. Using this method, NASA scientists can more easily analyze multiple datasets from various sources at the same time. This can lead to faster studies of Mars\u2019 surface composition to find clues of previous life.\n\nThe algorithm demonstrates how data science impacts traditional scientific fields like chemistry, biology, and geology.\n\nEven further, Wright is developing Nested Fusion applications to model shifting climate patterns, plant and animal life, and other concepts in the earth sciences. The same method can combine overlapping datasets from satellite imagery, biomarkers, and climate data.\n\n\u201cUsers have extended Nested Fusion and similar algorithms toward earth science contexts, which we have received very positive feedback,\u201d said Wright, who studies machine learning (ML) at Georgia Tech.\n\n\u201cCross-correlational analysis takes a long time to do and is not done in the initial stages of research when patterns appear and form new hypotheses. Nested Fusion enables people to discover these patterns much earlier.\u201d\n\nWright is the data science and ML lead for PIXLISE, the software that NASA JPL scientists use to study data from the Mars Perseverance Rover.\n\nPerseverance uses its Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) to collect data on mineral composition of Mars\u2019 surface. PIXL\u2019s two main tools that accomplish this are its X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectrometer and Multi-Context Camera (MCC).\n\nWhen PIXL scans a target area, it creates two co-aligned datasets from the components. XRF collects a sample's fine-scale elemental composition. MCC produces images of a sample to gather visual and physical details like size and shape.\n\nA single XRF spectrum corresponds to approximately 100 MCC imaging pixels for every scan point. Each tool\u2019s unique resolution makes mapping between overlapping data layers challenging. However, Wright and his collaborators designed Nested Fusion to overcome this hurdle.\n\nIn addition to progressing data science, Nested Fusion improves NASA scientists' workflow. Using the method, a single scientist can form an initial estimate of a sample\u2019s mineral composition in a matter of hours. Before Nested Fusion, the same task required days of collaboration between teams of experts on each different instrument.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest lessons I have taken from this work is that it is valuable to always ground my ML and data science problems in actual, concrete use cases of our collaborators,\u201d Wright said.\n\n\u201cI learn from collaborators what parts of data analysis are important to them and the challenges they face. By understanding these issues, we can discover new ways of formalizing and framing problems in data science.\u201d\n\nImage Portrait of ML Ph.D student Austin P. Wright, lead developer of Nested Fusion\n\nWright presented Nested Fusion at KDD 2024, held Aug. 25-29 in Barcelona, Spain. KDD is an official special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery. The conference is one of the world\u2019s leading forums for knowledge discovery and data mining research.\n\nNested Fusion won runner-up for the best paper in the applied data science track, which comprised of over 150 papers. Hundreds of other papers were presented at the conference\u2019s research track, workshops, and tutorials.\n\nWright\u2019s mentors, Scott Davidoff and Polo Chau, co-authored the Nested Fusion paper. Davidoff is a principal research scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Chau is a professor at the Georgia Tech School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE).\n\n\u201cI was extremely happy that this work was recognized with the best paper runner-up award,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThis kind of applied work can sometimes be hard to find the right academic home, so finding communities that appreciate this work is very encouraging.\u201d"
