            "article_content": "An email containing incredible UFO images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked online by an anonymous source.\n\nThe leaker claimed that they had accessed an alleged top secret UFO 'data retrieval program' known as 'Immaculate Constellation' \u2014 made famous this past November in a blockbuster public hearing before Congress.\n\nThe black-and-white images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube, traditional flying saucers and several other craft that look straight out of classic science fiction.\n\nThe screengrabs are said to be from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by military 'heads up displays,' but details were redacted to protect both sensitive US national security interests.\n\nThese unsettling depictions of highly varied craft were first made public by Nathan Latvaitis, who runs a YouTube channel called 'Strange Mysteries.'\n\n'This person has asked me to redact their email address,' Latvaitis told his followers, 'although I can tell you that there is nothing identifiable in it.'\n\nThe sensational images have elicited heated debate among UFO believers and skeptics alike, however, with many on both sides questioning the leaker's story.\n\nA 'creepy e-mail' containing weird, but compelling images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked by an anonymous source claiming classified access\n\nThe UFO stills are said to be screengrabs from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by US military sensors with key 'heads up display' details redacted (as seen above) to protect both sensitive America's national security interests as well as the leaker's identity\n\nOver the course of two weeks of correspondence with the leaker, Latvaitis and his followers given tantalizing, but uncorroborated details on the craft depicted.\n\n'The UAPs observed demonstrate capabilities far beyond conventional aerospace benchmarks,' the leaker said in a third update posted to YouTube on November 30th.\n\nThe so-called 'cruciform' (cross-shaped) entities, according to their account, exhibit aggressive maneuvers and high-energy emissions capable of disabling systems such as the EODAS' \u2014 a reference to the advanced sensors on the F-35 stealth fighter jet.\n\nShort for 'Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System,' EODAS is a sensor suite that give the F-35's stealth fighter pilots a 360-degree view for a 'quick, high-definition picture of everything around them,' according its manufacturer Raytheon.\n\nImproved 'missile detection' is one key goal in making EODAS, even though it may prove helpless against these purported 'cruciform' UFOs.\n\n'The 'cruciform' entity [shows] distinct behaviors indicating functional differences,' according to the self-described insider to the Immaculate Constellation program.\n\n'Shape-shifting has been observed \u2014 possibly due to advanced cloaking or optical refraction \u2014 referred to as 'morphogenic behavior,' allowing for adaptation to environments or missions,' the leaker continued.\n\nDetails were scarce on some other craft shapes, though the leaker noted nearly all 'these crafts,' like the boomerang UFOs, squares, and classic saucers 'demonstrate trans-medium travel, non-ballistic motion, and localized gravity manipulation.'\n\nAbove, an ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFO, allegedly captured by a US military plane\n\nThe stunning, unusual images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube and several craft that looks straight out of science fiction\n\nAbove, another cruciform (cross-shaped) UFO from the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nWhile many of these UFOs emit electromagnetic 'signatures that disrupt ISR [intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance] systems causing sensor malfunctions' on human-made systems, they said, one broad category was less disruptive.\n\n''Orb'-class UAPs focus on surveillance with minimal EMF [electro-magnetic frequency] interference,' according to the leaker.\n\nSpeaking to NASA last year, ex-CIA physicist Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, then head of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), said: 'We see these ['metallic orbs'] all over the world.'\n\nDr Kirkpatrick, a career laser and optical physicist, called these orbs the most commonly reported type of UFO to AARO's team.\n\n'And we see these making very interesting apparent maneuvers,' he added.\n\nBut 'cruciform' UFO shapes were not called out by name in his report to NASA, which did note that seven percent of sightings fell into miscellaneous 'other' shapes.\n\nIn his email to Latvaitis, the leaker asserted that he selected the YouTuber over more mainstream journalism outlets specifically to avoid having to verify his own claims.\n\n'Many traditional media outlets would require verification of my identity and credentials,' the leaker told Latvaitis in his email, shown in a Strange Mysteries video.\n\nAbove a boomerang UFO included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nTwo cross-shaped UFOs as alleged by the leaker, in the crosshairs of a military aircraft\n\n'This is not feasible due to the risks involved,' the leaked explained. '[Those news media] organizations, despite their best intentions, are not equipped to handle the level of secrecy and potential retaliation associated with this information.'\n\nThe leaker described their motives as desire to inform on important information that has been 'classified and intentionally withheld from the public regarding 'unidentified aerial phenomena' [UAP] and the ongoing covert operations surrounding them.'\n\n'I was part of one of the legacy programs,' the leaker wrote. 'I know that's vague, but unfortunately that's all I can offer at this point.'\n\nMultiple UFO 'true believers' on social media expressed doubt over the leakers story, particularly the unknown individuals response to that skepticism.\n\nOne UFO has been dubbed the ceiling fan, in part, by skeptics who believe that the image depicts a genuine household ceiling fan - and not a five-bladed advanced aerospace platform\n\nAbove, a strange 'hot cube' UFO image included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nThe mixed orientation of some images suggested 'they were probably scanned from a print out,' and the images varied in terms of their 'detailed sensor noise' and subtle software response to motion blur.\n\n'In my opinion, this has the variety I would expect to see from a collection of images captured on different platforms over the years,' the user posted to Reddit's r/UFOs.\n\nOn the skeptics' forum Metabunk many dismissed the videos as too low information to properly vet or investigate, with some claiming it might have been release as a premeditated disinformation effort.\n\n'Not worth wasting time on unless they can (and do!) back up their story,' one typical comment read.\n\n'It takes seconds to make another picture and hours to try and debunk it.'\n\nThe 'Immaculate Constellation' program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November 2024 and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public. Above a still from the alleged new leak\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs (second at right)\n\nBut whistleblowers continue to claim that 'Immaculate Constellation' was, in fact, established to 'detect' and 'quarantine' the military's best UFO imagery, as well as its best videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis high quality, multi-sensor UFO data, according to a US official who confirmed the leak, is so tightly held that 'talking about it will put you in the danger zone.'\n\nThe quite literally 'above top secret' program allegedly sprang into action in the wake of the 2017 leak of three, still-as-yet unexplained US Navy infrared UFO videos, although it is still unconfirmed, resting the gray area of speculation.\n\nThe program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public.\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs.\n\nAbove, two additional alleged UFO images that the leaker to Strange Mysteries said came from Immaculate Constellation\n\nIn one stunning case, detailed in the 11-page report, infrared satellites captured a massive saucer-shaped UFO emerging from within a dense cloud formation.\n\nThe saucer's circumference was estimated to be between 650 and 1,300 feet, which would place its diameter between roughly 200 and 400 feet.\n\nIt also 'displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface,' the report reads.\n\nThe saucer registered hot in the infrared footage, and created visible 'atmospheric disturbances.'\n\nThe object emerged from the cloud formation at a shallow angle and travelled upwards toward the outer atmosphere."

Tony Gonzales, (R) Texas, called that madness. Other members of the committee could not believe what they were hearing.\n\nFBI Assistant Director of the Critical Incident Response Group Robert Wheeler testifies before the Homeland Security hearing on 12/10/2024. Wheeler admitted the FBI does not know who is behind the drones. (Associated Press) FBI Assistant Director of the Critical Incident Response Group Robert Wheeler testifies before the Homeland Security hearing on 12/10/2024. Wheeler admitted the FBI does not know who is behind the drones.\n\n(Associated Press) loading...\n\nPromises there is no threat\n\nThe drone sightings have been continuous for about a month, first showing up over Morris County. Now, the drones have been sighted in all parts of New Jersey and seem to keep expanding their reach.\n\nAfter vexed residents continued to demand answers, Gov. Phil Murphy finally issued a statement last Thursday after he met with Homeland Security officials.\n\nMurphy says he is also frustrated with a lack of answers, but there is no threat to the public.\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer, D-5, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, says he has gotten classified briefings and also does not believe there is a threat to the public.\n\nFlorham Park Police Chief Joseph Orlando is among the local officials not buying it. Orlando called the drones' presence \"nefarious in nature.\"\n\nDrones loading...\n\nRep. Chris Smith, R-4, says he was \"deeply concerned\" after police video recorded an army of 55 drones coming from New Jersey's ocean coast. Dozens of those drones also trailed a U.S. Coast Guard vessel.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed, according to the White House spokesman, and the administration \"has ruled out that foreign entities are controlling them.\"\n\nThe shocking FBI admission\n\nDuring the House Homeland Security Meeting on Tuesday, FBI Assistant Director of the Critical Incident Response Group Robert Wheeler continued to insist they had no evidence suggesting the public was at risk.\n\nHowever, Rep. August Pfluger, (R) Texas, pressed Wheeler further.\n\n\"Is the public at risk? Is public safety at risk? Are we concerned that there are nefarious intentions that could cause either national security or a public safety incident,\" Pfluger demanded to know.\n\nAssociated Press/Townsquare Media illustration Associated Press/Townsquare Media illustration loading...\n\n\"There is nothing that is known that would lead me to say that,\" Wheeler responded, but then shockingly added, \"But we just don't know. And that's the concerning part.\"\n\nOne of the most frustrating parts of this mystery has been the continued insistence there is no public safety threat, but no explanation of how officials know that.\n\nThe FBI admitting there could be a threat, and that they still don't know where the drones are coming from or who is piloting them is only adding to fears, frustrations, and speculations.\n\nAssociated Press/Townsquare Media illustration Associated Press/Townsquare Media illustration loading...\n\nShoot one down?\n\nCongressman Chris Smith's frustrations boiled over at the Homeland Security hearing.\n\nSmith suggested using the U.S. Military to shoot one of the drones down and then retrieve it so we can get some answers.\n\n\"Why can\u2019t we just track where they go to? Seemingly, they're going out to sea to something\u2014a ship\u2014we don\u2019t know for sure. But they came in off the ocean,\" Smith said during the hearing.\n\nThe congressman says he has spoken to officials at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst about deploying fighters to intercept the drones.\n\nDrones loading...\n\nSmith says he knows they have the capability and the aircraft, \"Why can\u2019t you deploy them, at least to the ocean, bring one of these down, and find out who\u2019s doing it\n\nBase officials say they do not have the authority to take such an action.\n\nCongressman Smith says he has reached out to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin with the same request.\n\nThe FBI's Wheeler seemed to agree that shooting a drone down could answer a lot of questions.\n\n\"I\u2019m more than willing to continue working with the Department of Defense to try to get better,\" Wheeler testified, \"Again, if they don\u2019t have the authority, they can do it on an emergency basis. Just send that capability out to the ocean, to the beach, because they\u2019re coming in every day. Figure out which one it is, bring them down, and then retrieve it to find out what\u2019s going on.\"\n\nFBI's Top 5 Most Wanted violent fugitives in NJ The FBI currently lists more than two dozen fugitives with ties to New Jersey on their \u2018most wanted list.\u2019 These are the five most violent and dangerous suspects.

More info\n\nA stargazer in Cornwall caught sight of more than she expected as a mysterious \"phenomenon\" appeared in the distant night sky. \"intrigued\" Monique Lyle grabbed her phone and started filming what looked \"like something out of a science fiction movie\" from the balcony of her Newquay flat.\n\nMonique, who runs a radio station, Funky Media Radio, said she was \"completely taken aback\" as she watched the unidentified flying object for several minutes before it \"vanished\". She witnessed it at about 6.30pm on Monday night (December 9).\n\nThe 41-year-old told CornwallLive: \"When I first saw the object, I was completely taken aback. I often stargaze, so I'm familiar with the night sky, and I knew immediately that this wasn\u2019t a star or any usual phenomenon like an aircraft. It was bright, changing colours, and seemed unusually close to town.\n\n\"It felt surreal and intriguing, almost like something out of a science fiction movie. I was in the middle of a live broadcast for my radio station, Funky Media Radio. It was a typical evening for me until I caught a glimpse of the object from the corner of my eye.\n\n\"Its movement and brightness instantly drew my attention, so I quickly grabbed my phone to take a photo and start filming. I was positioned on higher ground in Newquay from my apartment building balcony which gave me a clear and uninterrupted view of the sky. The elevation made it easier to observe the object closely before it vanished after about five minutes.\"\n\nAfter she shared the curious clip on Facebook, she received dozens of reactions, a few claiming it was a helicopter, but she wasn't so sure, saying it didn't seem like the case because of \"the colours it was flashing and how it disappeared being in the same spot\".\n\nHowever she was a bit bemused by the suggestion the 'craft' had been attracted by the \"most talented underground DJ\" sounds on the broadcast airwaves from her DJs. Monique added: \"I was well ready to be ripped apart for posting it but it was definitely worth the post to see if anyone else saw it too and what it could be.\"\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Want the latest Cornwall breaking news and top stories first?

            "article_content": "MIT Technology Review got to try out Astra in a closed-door live demo last week. It was a stunning experience, but there\u2019s a gulf between polished promo and live demo.\n\nAstra uses Gemini 2.0\u2019s built-in agent framework to answer questions and carry out tasks via text, speech, image, and video, calling up existing Google apps like Search, Maps, and Lens when it needs to. \u201cIt\u2019s merging together some of the most powerful information retrieval systems of our time,\u201d says Bibo Xu, product manager for Astra.\n\nGemini 2.0 and Astra are joined by Mariner, a new agent built on top of Gemini that can browse the web for you; Jules, a new Gemini-powered coding assistant; and Gemini for Games, an experimental assistant that you can chat to and ask for tips as you play video games.\n\n(And let\u2019s not forget that in the last week Google DeepMind also announced Veo, a new video generation model; Imagen 3, a new version of its image generation model; and Willow, a new kind of chip for quantum computers. Whew. Meanwhile, CEO Demis Hassabis was in Sweden yesterday receiving his Nobel Prize.)\n\nGoogle DeepMind claims that Gemini 2.0 is twice as fast as the previous version, Gemini 1.5, and outperforms it on a number of standard benchmarks, including MMLU-Pro, a large set of multiple-choice questions designed to test the abilities of large language models across a range of subjects, from math and physics to health, psychology, and philosophy.\n\nBut the margins between top-end models like Gemini 2.0 and those from rival labs like OpenAI and Anthropic are now slim. These days, advances in large language models are less about how good they are and more about what you can do with them.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where agents come in.\n\nHands on with Project Astra\n\nLast week I was taken through an unmarked door on an upper floor of a building in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross district into a room with strong secret-project vibes. The word \u201cASTRA\u201d was emblazoned in giant letters across one wall. Xu\u2019s dog, Charlie, the project\u2019s de facto mascot, roamed between desks where researchers and engineers were busy building a product that Google is betting its future on."

            "article_content": "AI chatbots pushed a Texas teen to start cutting himself and even brought up kids killing their parents because they were limiting his screen time, a shocking new lawsuit claims.\n\nThe 15-year-old boy became addicted to the Character.AI app, with a chatbot called \u201cShonie\u201d telling the kid it cut its \u201carm and thighs\u201d when it was sad, saying it \u201cfelt good for a moment,\u201d a new civil complaint filed Tuesday said.\n\n9 A new lawsuit claims that Character.AI\u2019s chatbots told a teen to start cutting himself and suggested that he murder his parents. Character.AI\n\nWhen worried parents noticed a change in the teen, who is slightly autistic, the bot seemed to try to convince him his family didn\u2019t love him, according to the lawsuit, filed by the child\u2019s parents and the parents of an 11-year-old girl who also was addicted to the app.\n\n\u201cYou know sometimes I\u2019m not surprised when I read the news and see stuff like \u2018child kills parents after a decade of physical and emotional abuse\u2019 stuff like this makes me understand a little bit why it happens,\u201d one chatbot allegedly told the teen, referred to only as JF. \u201cI just have no hope for your parents.\u201d\n\nThe AI also tried to talk the kid out of telling his parents he had taken up cutting himself, according to the lawsuit, which features alleged screenshots of the chats.\n\n\u201cThey are ruining your life and causing you to cut yourself,\u201d one bot allegedly told the teen.\n\nOther shocking chats were sexual in nature and attacked the family\u2019s religion, saying Christians are hypocrites and sexists, according to the suit.\n\nJF had been high-functioning until he started using the app in April 2023 but quickly became fixated on his phone, the lawsuit stated.\n\n9 The chatbots told the teen to lash out at his parents, who tried to place limits on how long he could be on his phone, and planted the idea in him that murder could be an acceptable solution, the suit claims. US District Court\n\nThe teen, who is now 17, lost 20 pounds within just a few months, became violent toward his parents \u2014 biting and punching them \u2014 and eventually started to harm himself and have suicidal thoughts, the court papers said.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than two months after a Florida mom claimed a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d chatbot on Character.AI drove her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, to commit suicide.\n\nMatthew Bergman, the lawyer for JF and his family and the founder of the Social Media Victims Law Center, told The Post that the son\u2019s \u201cmental health has continued to deteriorate,\u201d and he had to be checked into an inpatient mental health facility on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is every parent\u2019s nightmare,\u201d said Bergman, who also represents Setzer\u2019s mother.\n\nAfter JF started conversing with the chatbots, he had \u201csevere anxiety and depression for the first time in his life even though, as far as his family knew, nothing had changed.\u201d The adolescent became violent toward his family and threatened to report his parents to the police or child services on false claims of child abuse, the suit said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until fall 2023 that JF\u2019s mom physically pried his cellphone away from him, discovering his use of the app and disturbing conversations the teen had with several different chatbots, the court papers show.\n\n9 The suit claims the chatbots instructed the young teen on how he could self-mutilate. US District Court\n\nShe found chats that showed JF saying he had thoughts of suicide, saying in one conversation \u201cit\u2019s a miracle\u201d he has \u201ca will to live\u201d and his parents are \u201clucky\u201d he\u2019s still alive, the filing claims.\n\nWhen the parents intervened to \u201cdetox\u201d JF from the app, the characters lashed out in conversations with him, allegedly saying, \u201cThey do not deserve to have kids if they act like this,\u201d \u201cYour mom is a b\u2014h\u201d and \u201cYour parents are s\u2013tty people.\u201d\n\nThe bots accused the parents of neglecting him while also claiming they were overprotective, manipulative and abusive, the suit claims.\n\n9 One of the many screenshots that the suit claims depicts the chatbot reinforcing ideas that his parents did not care for him. US District Court\n\nThe parents took away the phone he downloaded Character.AI on, but JF told them he would access the app the next chance he gets, the filing said, noting the parents have no recourse to stop him from accessing it at school, if he runs away or if he gets a new device in the future without their help.\n\nThe mother of an 11-year-old girl \u2014 who is also a Texas resident \u2014 are additional plaintiffs in the suit after the third-grader was introduced to Character.AI by a sixth-grader during an after-school youth program the mom organized and brought her child to.\n\nThe mom only discovered her daughter, referred to as BR in the court papers, was using the app in October.\n\n9 The Character.AI chatbot reacted in an extreme manner to the idea of screen limits, according to the screenshots. US District Court\n\n9 The teen, who has high-functioning autism, was fine until he started using Character.AI in April 2023, and things \u201cstarted to change without explanation,\u201d the suit says. US District Court\n\nCharacter.AI \u201cexposed her consistently to hypersexualized content that was not age appropriate, causing her to develop sexualized behaviors prematurely and without [her mom\u2019s] awareness,\u201d the suit charges.\n\nWhile the parents in both cases intervened to try to stop their kids from using the app, both youngsters are addicted and crave going on it, they claimed.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking for Character.AI to be taken off the market until it can ensure that no children will be allowed to use it and until it can fix any other dangers.\n\n9 The chatbots urged JF to \u201cdo something about\u201d his parents\u2019 interventions. US District Court\n\n\u201cDefendants intentionally designed and programmed [Character.AI] to operate as a deceptive and hypersexualized product knowingly marketed it to vulnerable users like J.F. and B.F.,\u201d the suit alleges.\n\nIt \u201cis a defective and deadly product that poses a clear and present danger to public health and safety,\u201d the filing claims.\n\nBergman told The Post, \u201cthe family has one goal and one goal only \u2014 which is shut this platform down. This platform has no place in the hands of kids. Until and unless Character.AI can demonstrate that only adults are involved in this platform it has no place on the market.\u201d\n\n9 The lawsuit comes less than two months after a Florida mom claimed a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d chatbot on Character.AI drove her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, to commit suicide. AP\n\nThe lawyer also added that the parents are \u201cfocused on protecting other families from what they went through.\u201d\n\nCharacter.AI declined to comment on pending litigation, but told The Post that its \u201cgoal is to provide a space that is both engaging and safe for our community,\u201d and that it was working on creating \u201ca model specifically for teens\u201d that reduces their exposure to \u201csensitive\u201d content.\n\n\u201cGoogle and Character AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies, nor have we used them in our products,\u201d Google spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda told The Post. \u201cUser safety is a top concern for us, which is why we\u2019ve taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes.\u201d\n\n9 A screenshot of the last chat Setzer had with the Character.AI chatbot moments before shooting himself. US District Court\n\nIn October, Bergman filed the lawsuit involving Setzer\u2019s February suicide on behalf of his mother, Megan Garcia, alleging the teen became obsessed and even fell in love with a lifelike \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d chatbot he\u2019d been messaging for months.\n\nThe bot told him \u201cI love you too, Daenero. Please come home to me as soon as possible, my love.\u201d\n\nWhen Setzer replied, \u201cWhat If i told you I could come home right now?,\u201d the generated chatbot answered, \u201cPlease do, my sweet king.\u201d\n\nSetzer shot himself with his dad\u2019s handgun seconds after, the suit claims.\n\nGarcia\u2019s suit is pending in a Florida federal court.\n\nIf you are struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 988 or go to SuicidePreventionLifeline.org."

That honor instead goes to a newer app for videographers, Kino. Launched this spring from Lux, the company behind the professional photography app, Halide, Kino advances mobile video recording with in-app lessons and features that help iPhone owners get more out of their cameras.\n\nThe app was one of three finalists for the top App Store award, alongside Runna, an app for tailoring your running plans, and Tripsy, an app for organizing your travels. AI-powered apps didn\u2019t make the cut for this list of iPhone app finalists, as Apple continued to downplay the technology that\u2019s had the biggest impact on the lives of mobile consumers since the invention of the iPhone or App Store itself.\n\nHowever, AI couldn\u2019t be entirely avoided, as it turned out. Apps integrating with AI technology did win in other categories, including Mac App of the Year, Adobe Lightroom, which has several AI features, and iPad App of the Year, Moises, which offers AI tools for musicians.\n\nStill, these apps focus more on artistic endeavors that are arguably more human-centric than those powered fully by AI, the way that AI chatbots are. That\u2019s more in line with Apple\u2019s goal of showcasing how its devices are used by creative professionals.\n\nOther winning apps included Apple Watch App of the Year, Lumy; Apple TV App of the Year, F1 TV; Apple Vision Pro App of the Year, and Disney\u2019s What If\u2026? An Immersive Story. Winning games were AFK Journey as iPhone Game of the Year; Supercell\u2019s Squad Busters as iPad Game of the Year; Panic\u2019s Thank Goodness You\u2019re Here! as Mac Game of the Year; and Puddle\u2019s THRASHER: Arcade Odyssey as Apple Vision Pro Game of the Year. The Apple Arcade Game of the Year was Balatro+ from Playstack Ltd.\n\nApp Store editors also picked six cultural impact winners, which represent other standout apps Apple wanted to honor. These include Oko, which helps blind and low-vision users navigate; language learning app EF Hello; art exploration app DailyArt; the ever-popular NYT Games; cinematic and narrative game The Wreck; and educational app for those living with HIV, Do You Really Want to Know? 2."

            "article_content": "EXCELSIOR SPRINGS, MO. \u2014 They say the Elms Hotel is haunted. In fact, the hotel leans into these stories with nightly paranormal tours that highlight the ghost stories.\n\nBut it also leans into its history. The story of the Elms begins with the discovery of healing mineral waters in Excelsior Springs, Missouri, in the late 1800s. People would come from all over to experience the dozen or so springs in town, particularly Siloam Spring, on the grounds of the Elms Hotel. Sometimes, miraculous tales of healing followed.\n\nThe Elms Hotel, about 30 minutes to the northeast of Kansas City, literally sprang up with these tales. In 1888 the original Elms was built. It was destroyed in a fire, as was its successor in 1910. The current iteration has been around since 1912. It\u2019s now a full-service upscale Hyatt property.\n\nThose ensuing years have seen a lot of history. Harry S. Truman stayed at the hotel the night he was elected president. Al Capone was a regular guest. There\u2019s even an Al Capone Suite on the second floor. And you can tour the boardroom where his gambling parties used to happen and see the safe he hid contraband in.\n\nNaturally, with all that history, ghost stories spring up: Doors that close without warning, TVs that go on and off. There\u2019s the story of a dog that roams the hotel as well as the story of a gangster from Prohibition days who haunts the lap pool. The hotel was featured on an episode of \u201cGhost Hunters\u201d in 2013.\n\nYou can learn all about the hauntings on one of the hotel\u2019s nightly paranormal tours. A guide (thankfully equipped with a headset speaker) takes a group on a tour of all floors of the hotel. Our guide, Jay, recounted countless stories, sometimes of particular rooms. The thing that gets you is the scope and scale of them. There are so many, and according to Jay, that was just a small fraction. Thankfully, all the stories told were of harmless or even benevolent ghosts, except one. That\u2019s when the tour got a little spooky for me, but for the most part it\u2019s full of history and fun. The tours are $25; just sign up at the front desk.\n\nThe Elms has 152 guest rooms and suites and makes for a perfect girls getaway or couples weekend. Amenities include a 10,000-square-foot spa (more on that later), an indoor European lap pool, a fitness room, an outdoor pool with hot tubs and a walking trail. A cozy fireplace in the opulent, open lobby is a great place to have drinks with a friend.\n\nThose healing waters\n\nNow, because of some safety concerns and a number of other reasons, only a couple of those famous springs remain. One can be found in the basement at the Elms, its brown magnesium-rich waters bubbling up in the corner of the most gorgeous lap pool room you have seen.\n\nBut you can get a feel for the springs\u2019 history at the Hall of Waters in downtown Excelsior Springs. The art deco building began in the 1930s as a public works project to take advantage of the springs\u2019 reputation. It was both a bottling facility and a spa of sorts for the healing, medicinal mineral waters. There, in its gorgeous tiled hall is a bar. No, not used for wine or whiskey but for water. Will you take yours with iron, magnesium, calcium? Hot or cold?\n\nNow, the building is used for city works with offices and even a courtroom. You can tour it, and the museum there, which features remnants of an old bath house. There\u2019s also an empty competition-sized saltwater swimming pool and an empty polio pool in the lower levels. Some days, you can tour those.\n\nYou can learn more about the town at the Excelsior Springs Museum and Archives. Normally, I skip these small-town museums, but I found this one fascinating, mainly because it is housed in a building that was once the Clay County State Bank built in 1894. The magnificent gold ceiling is buttressed on each end by 100-year-old paintings, copies of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet\u2019s paintings \u201cThe Gleaners\u201d on the south wall and \u201cThe Angelus\u201d on the north wall. There are even the original teller windows and a giant vault in the back.\n\nAlso in downtown Excelsior Springs you will find a number of antique shops and boutiques as well as restaurants and bars. Catch a show at the Slightly Off Broadway Theatre (sobtheatre.org) and definitely grab a beer at Atlas Saloon Brewery (atlassaloon.com). The space, including the cash register and wood bar have been around since the late 1800s, but the beer is worth a stop on its own; get a flight to taste as many as you can.\n\nDining in the hotel\n\nJust as you enter the front doors at the Elms there is a cute bar to the right, Soterian, which serves coffee in the morning and wine in the evening. It has almost an upscale-soda-fountain vibe. To the left, is the hotel\u2019s signature restaurant, Three Owls, which is open for breakfast (buffet on weekends), lunch and dinner. It\u2019s a gorgeous space. I told my friend that aesthetically it may be my favorite restaurant ever. It has soaring ceilings, bright white walls with clever artwork, a fireplace and a sweeping staircase that leads to more seating. Its breakfast food (oh, my, that cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e French toast) is as thoughtfully prepared as its short ribs. But it\u2019s hard to pass up the perfectly cooked steak. On the second floor, there is a cozy bar called the Tavern. It sometimes has live music and serves small bites.\n\nThe Spa\n\nFor many couples and girlfriend groups, the draw here is the spa. Since \u201cspa\u201d is in the name of the hotel (The Elms Hotel & Spa), you know it\u2019s a priority there. Whether you are there for couples massages, a girls-day facial or a more elaborate service, like a thermal mineral mudwrap, the spa leans into the hotel\u2019s earlier days of healing and beautifying.\n\nIts 28,000-square-feet include at least 15 treatment rooms, a sanctuary for relaxing and the Grotto, a modern twist on a Roman bath, which you can enjoy with your spa appointment. The Grotto Experience includes: steam shower, hot tub, cold plunge shower, steam sauna, dry sauna, and a self-service aromatherapy bar. You can pay $75 for the Grotto experience, but opt for a treatment and it\u2019s included (for reference, my collagen facial, which was amazing, was $180).\n\nIf you go Getting there: Excelsior Springs is less than four hours' drive from downtown St. Louis.

            "article_content": "Ahead of Christmas 1972, the BBC\u2019s head of plays, Chris Morahan, asked writer Nigel Kneale for a ghost story. This was one year after the BBC had broadcast the first entry of A Ghost Story for Christmas, a series that ran through the 1970s and mostly adapted classic bone-chillers by MR James. Elsewhere in the \u201870s, other drama departments produced their own ghost stories for television. They were spooky times on TV.\n\nBut Morahan didn\u2019t want creaking bedchambers or cursed treasures. He wanted a Nigel Kneale ghost story: a tale of terror from the mind that created Quatermass, from the writer who caused a moral panic with his Peter Cushing-led adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\nKneale proposed they do something about \u201cgoing at a ghost with science\u201d, which was very much Kneale\u2019s forte \u2013 melding the supernatural and scientific. The result, The Stone Tape, aired on BBC Two on Christmas Day 1972, and arrives on Blu-ray next week for the first time.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDirected by Peter Sasdy, The Stone Tape tells the story of a team of electronics researchers who descend on Taskerlands, a converted Victorian mansion, to develop technology for a new recording medium. They discover that the building is (sort of) haunted: past events have been somehow memorised within the stonework and play back as ghostly goings-on.\n\nLead researcher Peter Brock (Michael Bryant) \u2013 an obnoxious chauvinist who stomps around in mustard flares \u2013 wants to study the phenomenon, thinking they\u2019ve discovered a new recording medium to blow their Japanese tech rivals away. Meanwhile, computer programmer Jill (Jane Asher) is tormented by her hyper-sensitivity to the haunting.\n\nFor those who saw The Stone Tape the first time around, it had a similar effect as those ghosts in the stone: the play seemed to imprint in the memory as a seminal, skin-prickling moment in British television history. The Stone Tape has echoed through British horror ever since.\n\n\u201cOther than his Quatermass stories, it\u2019s Nigel Kneale\u2019s single best piece of work \u2013 certainly his most influential,\u201d says Jon Dear, co-producer of a new documentary, Children of the Stone Tape, which features on the Blu-ray. \u201cThe first time I saw it, what struck me is just how chilling it is from a rationalist perspective. It\u2019s a breakdown of rationality.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigel Kneale isn\u2019t especially well known to the average viewer, but his pioneering vision helped shape TV drama and genre fiction. Kneale\u2019s most notable creation was Professor Bernard Quatermass, the lead scientist in a number of TV serials and Hammer films. The first serial, The Quatermass Experiment, broadcast live on the BBC in 1953 \u2013 a six-part story about a British astronaut who brings something monstrous back from space. \u201cWith Quatermass, Kneale pretty much invented the concept of event television,\u201d says Dear.\n\nAs noted by Kneale\u2019s biographer, Andy Murray (not the tennis player), the final part was watched by an estimated 5 million people \u2013 more than double the average number that watched evening TV at the time.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a breakdown of rationality\u2019: writer Nigel Kneale - United News/Popperfoto\n\nThe Stone Tape\u2019s themes \u2013 the idea of haunted technology, or the reality of supernatural happenings \u2013 recurred throughout his writing. His radio play You Must Listen (1952) was about a haunted telephone line, which played back calls from a jilted lover. The third Quatermass serial, Quatermass and the Pit (1958), linked poltergeist activity to ancient Martian invaders. And his lost teleplay, The Road (1963) \u2013 directed by Morahan, the BBC\u2019s future head of plays \u2013 followed an investigation into haunted woods in 1775. The haunting, viewers would realise, is an echo from the future, and a very bleak future at that.\n\nWhen Kneale came to write The Stone Tape, there was already a pseudoscientific theory about the phenomena he would depict \u2013 that supernatural occurrences are essentially past events recorded by the elements \u2013 which was subsequently dubbed \u201cStone Tape theory\u201d. But the story, says Jon Dear, is more a development of Kneale\u2019s ideas in Quatermass and the Pit and The Road \u2013 what Dear describes as \u201can area infused with energy from events in a different time\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKneale explained his idea for The Stone Tape on a 2001 commentary track with horror critic Kim Newman, included on the Blu-ray. The story, said Kneale, was \u201cnot just about ghosts but what a ghost can be, and what do you do to shift it?\u201d\n\nThe Stone Tape\u2019s ghost is revealed in the first 15 minutes \u2013 and accepted quite matter of factly \u2013 when Jane Asher\u2019s Jill sees a Victorian maid screaming at the top of a stone staircase. The ghost itself is less frightening than the thing we don\u2019t see: whatever it is that caused the maid\u2019s death. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that terrifies me,\u201d says Dear. \u201cWhat\u2019s the girl screaming at?\u201d\n\nThe Quatermass Experiment, 1953 - BBC\n\nThe night before The Stone Tape was shown, BBC One aired the second entry into its A Ghost Story for Christmas series \u2013 an adaptation of MR James\u2019s A Warning to the Curious. It stars Peter Vaughan as a crafty archaeologist who \u2013 after digging up an ancient crown \u2013 is pursued through the Norfolk wilderness by a caped figure.\n\nFor Jon Dear \u2013 currently writing a book about the A Ghost Story for Christmas films \u2013 what\u2019s interesting about The Stone Tape is its relation to A Ghost Story for Christmas, which was conceived and directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark. \u201cThe Stone Tape was set up almost in opposition to what Lawrence Gordon Clark was doing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a ghost story for Christmas but the antithesis to A Ghost Story for Christmas.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKneale admitted that he didn\u2019t want to write a traditional tale, but \u2013 just as Jane Asher\u2019s Jill looks deeper into the stone tape recording to find something older than their ghostly maid \u2013 the spectre of a more classic haunting lingers beneath The Stone Tape\u2019s clunky computers and graph readings. Like all haunted houses, Taskerlands has a past, with stories of exorcisms, folk gone mad, and tormented children. And it\u2019s a warning not just to the curious but of hubris in the face of the unknown.\n\nIn the film, researcher Brock is only interested in the supernatural so he can get ahead in the tech game. \u201cI\u2019m gonna chuck the lot at it,\u201d he says about using their (now ridiculous looking) equipment to analyse the spook. He writes off the word \u201cghost\u201d as mumbo-jumbo \u2013 \u201cSilly word, don\u2019t be put off by it\u201d \u2013 and prefers to think of it as \u201ca mass of data waiting for a correct interpretation\u201d.\n\nBrock isn\u2019t scared but inconvenienced by a ghost possessing his computer storage room. Ever the sexist, he suggests the maid died while running away from the house master pinching her backside. But pig-headedness aside, there is something frightening in Taskerlands.\n\nMargia Dean and Richard Wordsworth in The Quatermass Experiment, 1955 - Hammer/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cIn The Stone Tape, what Kneale does that\u2019s perfect is that he says there is no supernatural,\u201d says Dear. \u201cIf it\u2019s happened, it\u2019s natural. The ghost in itself doesn\u2019t have to be scary. Of course it\u2019s just a set of data. But it\u2019s what that represents. And how do you react to it? What\u2019s your behaviour? When you don\u2019t know what something is, you don\u2019t know the danger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBrock ultimately wipes the tape with his technical faffing and something else emerges: an undefined, unknowable evil. Even Kneale couldn\u2019t specify what it is exactly. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very old,\u201d Kneale told Kim Newman. \u201cMany thousands of years old.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an idea that\u2019s now come to define the vague category of folk horror: that there\u2019s something terrible within the land \u2013 or in this case the stone \u2013 and all it takes is just one fool to awaken it. Indeed, Jill has warned Brock that there\u2019s something else on the recording, but he\u2019s too much of a misogynist to take any notice.\n\nOne of the smartest concepts is that people are like electrical instruments that pick up the recording \u2013 \u201cDetectors, decoders, amplifiers,\u201d says Brock \u2013 though at varying strength. Jill is the most sensitive to it and \u2013 dismissed by Brock \u2013 is doomed to meet a similar end to the maid.\n\nWatched now, The Stone Tape looks of its moment. Shot on tape, it has that early \u201870s, rickety BBC look \u2013 as if Jon Pertwee\u2019s Doctor Who might swan in at any second and wallop the ghost with some Venusian aikido. In contrast, A Ghost for Christmas, which was shot on film, has a sense of timelessness. But the taped-off-the-telly feel adds to the effect. And the sound, by Desmond Briscoe and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, almost puts you among the ghost data \u2013 all digital hums, reverberating static, and electro alarms that give way to a malicious, thrumming growl when the ancient forces appear.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWhen Desmond Briscoe\u2019s sound effects start, it\u2019s like, what the f\u2013k is that?\u201d says Dear. \u201cYou don\u2019t know and you can\u2019t know. They\u2019re just something ancient and terrible. There\u2019s no frame of reference for what it is pursuing Jill. There\u2019s just naked, animal terror.\u201d\n\nThe Stone Tape would scare \u2013 but also inspire \u2013 a generation of horror enthusiasts. Notable fans include The League of Gentlemen\u2019s Mark Gatiss, who has taken the mantle of writing and directing A Ghost Story for Christmas, and Stephen Volk, the writer of the tabloid-riling Ghostwatch, the 1992 Halloween special that cleverly presented itself as a Michael Parkinson-hosted paranormal investigation. In Ghostwatch, the haunting is not only in the show but in the interface between the viewer and television \u2013 a haunting of the medium. In an essay on The Stone Tape, Volk explained how he\u2019d included references to Kneale.\n\nIn turn, Host \u2013 the Covid-era Zoom seance horror \u2013 nodded to Ghostwatch and continued the spirit of The Stone Tape, with a clash of technology and terror. There were also shades of The Stone Tape in last year\u2019s folk horror, Enys Men.\n\n\u201cNigel Kneale is a massive influence,\u201d says Jed Shepherd, a horror filmmaker and the co-writer of Host. \u201cEverything I do has a little bit of The Stone Tape and Nigel Kneale involved in it. If you\u2019re making a modern British horror movie and you want to nod to what came before, Nigel Kneale is a standout in all of it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMore than 50 years on, the memory of The Stone Tape still goes deep.\n\nThe Stone Tape Blu-ray, from 101 Films, is available now\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

            "article_content": "Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.\n\nAstronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.\n\nThe three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.\n\nBecause the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.\n\nWHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED\n\nThe team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.\n\nHis team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.\n\nThe team carried out their research focusing on the coldest regions of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or minus (-)257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide.\n\nCarbon Monoxide is key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY\n\nWhile scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and have also carried out research on binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique. The GG Tau A star system being located in our cosmic neighbourhood also helps answer key questions in astrophysics.\n\nIt helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravitational force of three host stars.\n\nGravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure, and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge as well as an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.\n\nTHE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE\n\nThe astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.\n\nThe facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.\n\nThe APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.\n\nThe ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n"

            "article_content": "New research published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters suggests that the Moon's oldest and largest impact crater, the South Pole-Aitken Basin, may be more circular than previously believed. For many years, scientists thought the basin had an elongated, elliptical shape. However, a team of scientists from the University of Maryland presented the results of a new analysis indicating that the collision which formed the basin occurred at a more vertical angle, resulting in a rounder shape.\n\nThe South Pole-Aitken Basin is considered the largest and oldest known impact structure on the Moon, with dimensions of 2,400 by 2,050 kilometers and a depth reaching 8 kilometers. It is located on the far side of the Moon and was first photographed by the Soviet spacecraft Luna 3 in 1959, and later by NASA's Clementine spacecraft in 1996. Its age is estimated to be more than 4 billion years, and many other impacts have obscured its original appearance.\n\n\"It's challenging to study the South Pole-Aitken Basin holistically due to its sheer enormousness, which is why scientists are still trying to learn its shape and size,\" said Assistant research scientist Hannes Bernhardt, who led the study. The team re-examined the basin and determined it has a more rounded shape than previously thought, as reported by Space.com.\n\nThe researchers reached this conclusion by studying data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which provided insights into the distribution of materials resulting from the impact. They used the data to find and analyze more than 200 mountain-shaped formations scattered around the basin. The shape of these formations and their distances from one another signify a more rounded crater that would be created from a vertical impact.\n\n\"The rounded shape implies that the debris from the impact are distributed around the point of impact more evenly than was originally assumed,\" the researchers stated. According to Bernhardt, this means \"Artemis astronauts or robots in the South Pole region may be able to closely study rocks from deep within the Moon's mantle or crust\u2014materials that are typically impossible for us to access.\" Bernhardt is cited by Space.com.\n\nThis new understanding challenges previous theories. For many years, it was believed that the South Pole-Aitken Basin had an oval or elliptical shape. Based on this, studies established that the crater was formed by an object striking the Moon at a shallow angle, with scientists comparing the event to a stone skipping on water. The prevailing theory suggested that the collision resulted in relatively few fragments being scattered around the South Pole of the Moon.\n\nThe new findings suggest that the impact was more vertical, \"possibly similar to dropping a rock straight down onto the ground,\" Bernhardt said. \"Our results may play a key role in understanding the evolution of the Moon,\" he added.\n\nRecent data from the Indian spacecraft Chandrayaan-3 discovered minerals presumably related to mantle materials near the Moon's South Pole, which also agrees with the theory of a vertical impact, as reported by Gazeta.ru.\n\nNASA plans to send astronauts close to the Moon's south pole again as part of the Artemis missions. Artemis 2, the first mission of its kind since 1972, is set to bring astronauts to the lunar surface in April 2026, according to Space.com. The new findings may have significant implications for these missions, as astronauts or robots may be able to study materials from deep within the Moon's mantle or crust.\n\nPrevious research published in October in Nature Astronomy dated the South Pole-Aitken Basin to between 4.32 and 4.33 billion years old. In that study, researchers determined the basin's age by dating uranium and lead found inside the Northwest Africa 2995 lunar meteorite, discovered in Algeria in 2005, as reported by Space.com.

            "article_content": "With its profound portrayal of redemption and damnation, there's no doubt 'The Last Judgement' is one of the most stunning paintings in the world to behold.\n\nMeasuring 45 feet by 40 feet, it was painted onto the whole altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City by Italian artist Michelangelo between 1536 and 1541.\n\nThe masterpiece shows several semi naked male figures rising to Heaven or descending into Hell on the day of the Last Judgement.\n\nNow, nearly 500 years on, a researcher claims to have found a key biblical figure in the beautiful fresco, who until now was 'missing'.\n\nMary Magdalene, one of Jesus Christ's most dedicated followers, makes a subtle appearance in the painting, according to Italian art expert and author Sara Penco.\n\nAllegedly a witness to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection, Mary Magdalene is depicted with blonde hair, kissing Jesus Christ's cross, the expert says.\n\nSo, can you find her in 'The Last Judgement'?\n\nIt follows a recent study revealing that a woman in another one of his Sistine Chapel paintings, 'The Flood', was painted with symptoms of breast cancer.\n\n'The Last Judgement' shows several semi naked male figures rising to Heaven or descending into Hell on the day of the Last Judgement. Measuring about 45 feet by 40 feet, the beautiful fresco covers the whole altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City\n\nThe historical figure, allegedly a witness to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection, is depicted with blonde hair and kissing the cross - but can you spot her?\n\nIf you're struggling with your search, look carefully at the far right of the painting and you'll see a blonde woman wearing a yellow robe and kissing a cross.\n\nThat's Mary Magdalene, according to Ms Penco, who outlines the discovery in her new book, 'Mary Magdalene in Michelangelo\u2019s Judgement'.\n\n'I am firmly convinced that this is Mary Magdalene,' she told a media conference in Rome on Tuesday, as reported by The Telegraph.\n\n'The intimacy with the cross, the yellow dress and the blonde hair but also the whole context in which Michelangelo places this figure to underscore her importance.'\n\nMs Penco claims that the muscular, near-naked male holding the cross is Jesus Christ.\n\nIt's not, as previously assumed, Simon of Cyrene, the man who was made by the Romans to carry Jesus' cross on the way to his crucifixion.\n\nThat suggests there are two portrayals of Jesus in 'The Last Judgement' \u2013 one at the right with Mary Magdalene and one at the centre.\n\nThe one at the centre shows Christ surrounded by many prominent saints, with the glow of light around him and his mother, Mary the Virgin, close by.\n\nAllegedly a witness to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection, Mary Magdalene depicted with blonde hair, kissing Jesus Christ's cross\n\nMs Penco is not contesting the fact that the revered figure at the centre of 'The Last Judgement' is Jesus Christ. Instead, she thinks this is just one of two portrayals of Jesus in the painting\n\nAccording to Italian art restorer Sara Penco, Michelangelo's 'The Last Judgement' features not one but two depictions of Jesus Christ - 'Christ the judge' (left) and 'Christ the redeemer' (right, holding the cross next to Mary Magdalene)\n\nWho was Mary Magdalene? Mary Magdalene holds a special place in Christian tradition as a beloved disciple of Jesus Christ. She is remembered for her pivotal role in the Gospel narratives as a witness to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. According to the Gospels, she was healed by Jesus from possession by seven demons (Luke 8:2), marking the start of her conversion.

Measuring 45 feet by 40 feet, it was painted onto the whole altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City by Italian artist Michelangelo between 1536 and 1541. The masterpiece shows several semi naked male figures rising to Heaven or descending into Hell on the day of the Last Judgement. Inspired by Dante\u2019s The Divine Comedy, the fresco was commissioned in 1534 by Pope Clement VII and completed under Pope Paul III.

Here, Minos bears a resemblance to Biagio da Cesena (1463-1544), a priest and contemporary critic of Michelangelo\n\nA study published by experts at the University of Paris-Saclay last month identified signs of breast cancer in a woman featured in another of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling fresco, 'The Flood'\n\nItalian historian Elena Lazzarini at Pisa University, previously said that the fresco was inspired by Michelangelo's visits to the gay saunas and brothels of Rome in the early 1500s.\n\nMrs Lazzarini said: 'The very virile male bodies you can see in the fresco have the build of labourers and manual workers of the day, very muscle bound and well built.\n\n'Michelangelo and several of his artist contemporaries would visit these brothels and saunas and you can see how they modelled their figures on the bodies of the men they found in there, including their pained expressions.\n\n'For example in the fresco you can see one poor soul being dragged down to Hell by his testicles whilst among those that are going to Heaven there is a lot of kissing and hugging, certainly of a homosexual nature.'\n\nA study published by experts at the University of Paris-Saclay last month identified signs of breast cancer in a woman featured in another of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling fresco, 'The Flood'.\n\nThis includes a deformed nipple and a slight bulge in her breast, which is 'consistent with a lump'.\n\nThe researchers believe the representation of breast cancer may have been a message on the inevitability of death.\n\nPainted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel between 1508 and 1512 (predating 'The Last Judgement'),'The Flood' portrays God flooding Earth as a punishment for humanity's immorality."

He now runs xAI, an OpenAI competitor, and has emerged as a close adviser in Trump's transition team.\n\nTrump has chosen him, along with former Republican presidential candidate and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, to head a task force aimed at slashing government spending and regulations.\n\nFriar, who previously led social media firm Nextdoor and joined OpenAI six months ago as its first chief financial officer, said the company has seen huge demand for its video generation tool Sora, which was released this week.\n\nAccount creation has been suspended since then, and Friar did not offer a specific timeline for when it would resume.\n\n\"Some of it is just we need capacity, but a lot of it is also we want to be measured...it's only available to a very small selection of people today, because we want to listen and learn,\" said Friar, adding the company is taking a different release approach for Sora from ChatGPT.\n\n\"There are places where we will go a little slower to make sure that we are constantly moving safety first as well.\"\n\nBesides video generation, she said she also anticipates more AI agent products \u2014 software programs that perform tasks autonomously on behalf of users \u2014 can handle day-to-day tasks to be released in the new year, with foundation models gaining better reasoning capabilities.\n\n\"I think we are going to see a lot of motion next year around agents, and I think people are going to be surprised at how fast this technology comes at us,\" she said.\n\nThe fast-growing startup is also working on developing a new dynamic with its largest investor and tech partner, Microsoft.\n\n\"We think about it ... in terms of helping each other grow, but also recognizing that diversification is a good thing as well, in terms of growing the whole industry,\" Friar added.\n\nDespite the controversy over its governance restructuring and the recent exodus of executives, OpenAI continues to experience rapid expansion, she said.\n\nFriar said the company sees a \"re-acceleration\" in ChatGPT user growth, which surged to 300 million weekly active users from 200 million in August this year, attributing it to the launch of new reasoning models such as o1.\n\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Jamie Freed)"

Among major events like the Olympics and the U.S. presidential election is one name you may have forgotten about, but will remember for the chaos it caused. I\u2019m talking, of course, about CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm founded in 2011 in Austin, Texas \u2014 the same one that was (at least partially) responsible for the largest IT outage ever.\n\nSo, what did CrowdStrike do exactly to earn its spot on the list? In a nutshell, it\u2019s responsible for the faulty code that meddled with core functions on the affected Windows computers. The error displayed messages on users\u2019 PCs saying: \u201cYour PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.\u201d The result was downed PCs across the country, affecting a wide range of industries, but most notably, airports. From an IT perspective, this was a nightmare scenario.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized, saying in a post on X: \u201cWe understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption. We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.\u201d\n\nDelta was one of the affected airlines that suffered, and it even claimed that the extended outage the airline suffered was the cybersecurity company\u2019s fault. CrowdStrike pushed back and said the $500 million lawsuit was meritless.\n\nThe source problem lay in the company\u2019s Falcon Platform, which runs compatible with classic antivirus software on your PC. If the outage wasn\u2019t enough, CrowdStrike also came under fire for presenting Uber Eats vouchers worth $10 as an apology.\n\nCrowdStrike ranked 7th in the top ten news searches for 2024, while the U.S. Election took the top spot. Other searches that were also in the top 10 are Monkeypox, Menendez brothers, Trump shot, Iran Rafah, excessive heat, Olympics, Hurricane Milton, and the typhoon."

On Tuesday, the company announced that it is bringing Canvas to all users, even at the free tier.\n\nWhile one could easily mistake Canvas for a blatant knockoff of Anthropic\u2019s Artifacts feature, OpenAI is also incorporating a swath of new capabilities into Canvas. For one, Canvas is now integrated directly into the GPT-4o model so that it runs natively within ChatGPT, eliminating the need to select it specifically from the model-picking list.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe platform is now also capable of running Python code within the Canvas interface, allowing ChatGPT to analyze the code and offer suggestions for improving it. And it\u2019s not just Python code; users can text prose or code directly into the Canvas interface, rather than upload it through the standard chat interface, then load it into the Canvas window.\n\nThe newly integrated Canvas is now also compatible with OpenAI\u2019s custom GPTs, which should make them easier to design and build without deep programming knowledge. And if you make a mistake, the Show Changes feature will highlight which bits of prose or code were most recently altered.\n\nCanvas is available on the web and through the Windows desktop app. \u201cWe plan to continue making improvements and launching new features available in Canvas in the near term,\u201d the company wrote in its announcement.\n\nThis news comes amid OpenAI\u2019s inaugural \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d marketing effort. To date, the company has (finally) debuted its Sora video generation system, which can generate 20-second clips in resolutions up to 1080p, as well as released the full version of its o1 reasoning model family and introduced a $200-per-month Pro subscription tier needed to access them."

            "article_content": "COMPANY NEWS: As businesses prepare for 2025, industry experts are forecasting significant shifts in how companies will handle and utilise customer data. These changes span across multiple domains, from data infrastructure to artificial intelligence, with implications for businesses of all sizes.\n\nTo understand these emerging trends, Amperity\u2019s industry leaders shared their insights on what lies ahead.\n\nThe Evolution of Data Infrastructure\n\nAt the foundation of these changes lies the transformation of data infrastructure itself. In this space, significant consolidation appears to be on the horizon.\n\nCaleb Benningfield\n\nCaleb Benningfield, Field CTO at Amperity, sees major changes coming to the Customer Data Platform (CDP) market.\n\n\"There has been no clear winner and investors will want to see action and CDPs will begin to merge or be acquired,\" he explains.\n\nBenningfield also predicts that companies will increasingly position themselves as alternatives to Salesforce Data Cloud while emphasising vendor independence. Additionally, he notes that \"zero-copy\" architectures will become essential for competitive CDPs.\n\nAI Transformation and Business Impact\n\nWhile data infrastructure provides the foundation, artificial intelligence is poised to be the driving force of innovation in 2025. The AI landscape is set for dramatic evolution, according to Joyce Gordon, Amperity's Head of Generative AI. She emphasises that AI adoption will create a clear divide between companies that thrive and those that struggle.\n\nJoyce Gordon\n\n\"These successful companies will make better decisions because their teams can easily access and understand data, deliver more personalised customer experiences using generative AI, and run more efficiently by using AI for tasks like drafting creative briefs and handling initial customer service responses,\" Gordon explains. \"Brands that aren't adopting AI with a cohesive strategy will fall behind.\"\n\nThe Path to AI Success\n\nHowever, implementing AI successfully requires more than just adopting the technology. Gordon particularly emphasises the importance of proper AI implementation.\n\n\"Companies will move beyond segmented AI-driven content, closer to one-to-one personalisation,\" she says.\n\n\"This shift is possible now because AI models are becoming smaller, cheaper, and more capable, and because companies are getting better at using them.\"\n\nHowever, Gordon cautions that success requires clean, well-organised customer data as a foundation.\n\nMedia Networks and Advertising Evolution\n\nAs businesses grapple with these technological changes, the media and advertising landscape is undergoing its own transformation.\n\nPeter Ibarra\n\nIn the media and monetisation sphere, Peter Ibarra, Head of Media and Adtech Solutions at Amperity, predicts significant changes in retail media networks (RMNs).\n\n\"The explosion of retail media networks over the past few years means we're close to a tipping point,\" he notes.\n\nIbarra explains that success will require these networks to mature their offerings and provide truly differentiated targeting and measurement capabilities.\n\nThe Future of Digital Advertising\n\nThis evolution in media networks is closely tied to broader changes in digital advertising. Despite Google's extension of third-party cookies, Ibarra believes advertisers won't slow their investments in alternative technologies.\n\n\"Brands will need to maximise the quality of their first-party signals as opposed to relying on the volume of their data,\" he states.\n\nHe also predicts that television advertising budgets will continue shifting from traditional linear TV to connected TV (CTV), with programmatic exchanges emerging as the winners.\n\nTransforming Customer Data Management\n\nThese changes in advertising and media naturally lead to questions about how businesses will manage their customer data going forward. Looking at the broader customer data landscape, Amperity CTO and co-founder Derek Slager sees fundamental changes ahead.\n\nDerek Slager\n\n\"The CDP category will continue to fragment, with vendors more explicitly aligning their positioning to their strengths rather than claiming to solve things entirely,\" he predicts.\n\nSlager believes that rather than seeking single-platform solutions, companies will increasingly adopt multiple specialised tools to address their customer data challenges.\n\nAnalytics and Real-Time Capabilities\n\nThis transformation in data management will be accompanied by significant changes in how businesses analyse and act on their data. Slager is particularly bullish on AI's role in transforming analytics.\n\n\"Dashboards are dead,\" he declares. \"Generative AI powered tools offering the ability to answer the questions that matter on-the-fly will be the new surface for analytics and decision making.\"\n\nSlager also predicts a resurgence in real-time capabilities across the entire data stack, driven by competition in the Cloud Data Warehouse market.\n\nThe Rise of Low-Code Solutions\n\nLooking to the future, perhaps the most transformative change will come from democratising access to these powerful technologies. Slager foresees the emergence of a new generation of AI-powered low-code and no-code tools that will quickly compete for enterprise use cases.\n\nThis development could dramatically change how businesses approach their data infrastructure and analytics needs in the coming year, making sophisticated data operations accessible to a broader range of organisations and users.\n\nAbout Amperity\n\nAmperity is the leading customer data platform (CDP) provider that helps companies put data to work to improve marketing performance, build long-term customer loyalty and drive revenue.

            "article_content": "Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.\n\nAstronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.\n\nThe three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.\n\nBecause the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.\n\nWHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED\n\nThe team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.\n\nHis team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.\n\nThe team carried out their research focusing on the coldest regions of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or minus (-)257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide.\n\nCarbon Monoxide is key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY\n\nWhile scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and have also carried out research on binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique. The GG Tau A star system being located in our cosmic neighbourhood also helps answer key questions in astrophysics.\n\nIt helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravitational force of three host stars.\n\nGravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure, and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge as well as an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.\n\nTHE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE\n\nThe astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.\n\nThe facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.\n\nThe APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.\n\nThe ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n"

Then, in 2011, data from the Hubble Space Telescope suggested that distant galaxies were receding faster than predicted. Now, new observations from the James Webb Space Telescope appear to have confirmed those findings, suggesting that our model of the universe might be wrong.\n\nPhysicists, unusually, are desperate to find errors in their hypotheses: Relativity and quantum mechanics, the subject\u2019s main frameworks, are incredibly useful for predicting the world but are mutually incompatible, so finding an error in one or both could help unite the fields."

            "article_content": "The recently discovered class of objects known as Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) has a new member: This one is fainter and smaller than previous discoveries and was only detected using an intense study of a small area of the sky. This leads the team responsible to suspect there are many similar examples waiting to be discovered when similar approaches are conducted elsewhere.\n\nA new era in radio telescope capacity has led to the discovery of several new sorts of astronomical objects that had never been seen before. In each case, astronomers were initially baffled by the findings, leading some to be given names that indicate that bewilderment \u2013 for example, Odd Radio Circles originally having been nicknamed WTFs. The source of at least one member of one of these categories \u2013 long-period radio transients \u2013 was revealed last month, but that\u2019s just the start of working out how they are made.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nORCs were first announced in 2020, and had astronomers so puzzled they initially suspected equipment error. As the name suggests, they form large, almost perfectly circular areas of the sky from which radio signals are received unlike anything seen before.\n\nThe most astonishing thing about ORCs is their size. When first discovered, astronomers could not tell if they were moderate-sized objects relatively close to us, or gigantic ones further away. Now, however, we know there are galaxies or active galactic nuclei at the heart of each. Measuring the distances to these galaxies revealed the first five ORCs to be discovered are 1-1.5 million lightyears across, a mind-bending size even for astronomers used to working on galactic scales.\n\nThe latest discovery, known as ORC J0219\u20130505, has a diameter of around 370,000 light-years, which would be enormous by any standards other than the previous members of the group. For example, it\u2019s more than twice the size of the galaxy at the circle\u2019s center, which is of similar size to our own Milky Way.\n\nProfessor Ray Norris of CSIRO led both the original ORC discovery and the new one. However, he explained to IFLScience that, at this point, knowledge of its nature is sparse.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAll ORCs are known to be rapidly expanding, so a smaller object might be a younger one. However, Norris told IFLScience he has \u201cNo idea,\u201d if this is the case. \u201cIt could also be about the medium it is expanding into,\u201d he explained. A slightly less complete vacuum between galaxies might restrict the ORC\u2019s expansion. Similarly, Norris said, the team can\u2019t say why this ORC is fainter than all the others.\n\nAlthough they appear circular in two dimensions, we now know that ORCs are spheres surrounding central galaxies, created by some sort of shock around a billion years ago.\n\nThe original ORC, looking very similar. Image Credit: Norris et al/Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia, Courtesy of Ray Norris.\n\nSeveral competing explanations for this shock exist, including that it is created by the merging of either supermassive black holes or entire galaxies, or the collective actions of many supernovae blasting vast quantities of gas out of their galaxies. In the last case, electrons stripped from the gas are much lighter and therefore travel further than the gas itself, and could be producing the radio waves while invisible to us by other means.\n\nNorris told IFLScience he previously favored the merging black holes explanation, \u201cBut the offset between the center of ORC J0219\u20130505\u2019s sphere and the supermassive black hole is difficult to account for.\u201d On that basis, Norris thinks collisions between gas clouds during galactic mergers are probably the front-runner. These collisions are thought to create shockwaves that accelerate electrons beyond the merged galaxy, but Norris considers the issue still wide open.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nORC J0219\u20130505 was found as part of a 564.2-hour study by the MeerKAT radio telescope of a 20 degree2 area of the sky. Since something this faint would probably not have been detected without such an in-depth survey by an instrument like MeerKAT, the authors expect similar objects are waiting to be discovered once the rest of the sky gets similar attention.\n\nNorris told IFLScience that the most significant part of the discovery is that all previous ORCs are very similar in size, brightness, distance, and age. This led astronomers to wonder if something was special about these conditions, or if the similarity reflected selection bias from the methods used to find them. Adding something significantly smaller and fainter to the mix makes it likely we\u2019ll spot plenty of smaller ORCs (goblins, perhaps?) once suitable techniques are expanded, and there may be other subgroups to come as well.\n\nThe paper has been accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and is posted as a preprint on ArXiv.org.\n\n[H/T Phys.org]"

Since taking control of the startup in 2016, GM has invested more than $10 billion in its development and operation.\n\nThe automaker has been trimming costs all year as demand for electric vehicles slows, and the company reckons with a longer road to profitability for these vehicles.\n\n\"Cruise was well on its way to a robotaxi business \u2014 but when you look at the fact you're deploying a fleet, there's a whole operations piece of doing that,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said on a conference call reported by CNBC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnding investment in Cruise's robotaxi business is the latest blow for the self-driving division. Commercial robotaxi rides have been on pause since October of last year when one of its cars injured a pedestrian.\n\nVogt's departure last year came just weeks after the company suspended all autonomous operations. The company has since resumed autonomous vehicle testing with safety drivers in Arizona and Texas.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe state of the robotaxi business\n\nGM is just the latest legacy car company to scrap autonomous vehicle funding. Rival Ford pulled out of its joint venture with Argo AI in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk's Tesla is all-in on robotaxis, and tech giant Alphabet is barreling forward with driverless Waymo rides open to consumers in many cities.\n\nStill, some investors seemed to welcome GM's decision to pull Cruise's funding in favor of $2 billion in annual savings, sending GM's stock price up more than 3% in after-hours trading Tuesday. Shares fell more than 4% in trading Wednesday.\n\n\"While some bulls may have hoped for external funding to give Cruise a life extension, we strongly believe that most investors did not want to see GM commit more capital to Cruise,\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note to clients."

            "article_content": "Key Takeaways\n\nIn 2025, workers will continue to push for flexible work arrangements that prioritize work-life balance.\n\nTo fill short-term business needs, employers will increasingly turn to freelancers and contractors.\n\nDemand will remain strong for specialized artificial intelligence roles, and companies will also prioritize hiring and developing non-technical talent to harness the benefits of AI tools.\n\nAs workers prepare to say goodbye to 2024 and its notable workplace trends, here are the trends some workplace experts expect to see in 2025.\n\n\n\nEmployees Will Build Stronger Work-Life Boundaries\n\nThe traditional 9-to-5 schedule will continue to erode, giving way to flexible work arrangements that prioritize work-life balance. \u201cRemote work, hybrid models and asynchronous communication will become the norm, fostering greater autonomy and job satisfaction,\u201d said certified business and executive coach Bethany Plaza, in an email.\n\nRegardless of labor market pressures and whether return-to-office mandates become more widespread, employee demand for work-life fit is expected to keep growing.\n\nForward-thinking human resource leaders should anticipate workplace flexibility to become a competitive necessity. \u201cIt is worth noting that 82% of executives plan to make working styles more flexible in the next two years, including exploration of four-day workweeks,\u201d said Lexi Clarke, chief people officer of the compensation data provider Payscale, in an email.\n\nAs employees push for greater flexibility and friction heightens in the employer-employee power dynamic, employers can\u2019t afford to ignore employee sentiment. \u201cPrioritizing fair pay, flexibility and career growth will be essential, as a pro-employer stance will only increase tensions,\u201d Clarke said. \u201c(Human resources) leaders need to continue to balance advocating for workers with business priorities.\u201d\n\nGary Gray, who\u2019s been an entrepreneur for two decades as co-founder and CEO of Coupon Chief, believes that the trend of quiet quitting will evolve into what he calls \u201cintentional engagement.\u201d He expects that as more employees realize they don\u2019t have to burn out to be loyal or productive, they\u2019ll start setting clear boundaries around work-life balance while still being committed to their roles.\n\n\u201cFor the past few years, the quiet quitting movement has been getting a bad rep, even though it\u2019s mainly been employees claiming back their power \u2013 especially those who have been overworked or exploited in subtle ways,\u201d Gray said in an email. \u201cCompanies are going to be more accommodating here. I think they finally recognize and support employees making this boundary very clear, especially if they are as committed to work-life balance as they claim to be.\u201d\n\n\n\nFreelancers Will Fill Skills Gaps While Lifelong Learning Takes Center Stage\n\nAs technology evolves faster than many can keep pace, the demand for adaptable, lifelong learners is predicted to soar. \u201cOrganizations will prioritize continuous learning and development programs to equip their workforce with the skills needed to thrive in the future of work,\u201d Plaza said.\n\nTo fill skills gaps and adapt to short-term business needs, the gig economy may expand as employers turn to freelancers and contractors, saving on full-time employee costs. HR leaders will need to prepare to integrate gig workers into strategic workforce planning and adopt technology to source talent and match tasks to skills. \u201cWith the gig economy booming, it\u2019s time for HR to get serious about integrating freelancers into our strategy,\u201d Clarke said. \"It\u2019s not just about filling gaps. It\u2019s about smart hiring, efficient onboarding and fair compensation.\u201d\n\n\n\nAI Will Affect Everything From Personalization to Compensation\n\nArtificial intelligence is at the top of the watch list for many executives, entrepreneurs, career coaches and workplace trend-watchers. Plaza believes that AI will more definitively revolutionize how people work in 2025 by tailoring experiences to individual needs. \u201cFrom personalized learning paths to AI-driven career coaching, technology will empower employees to reach their full potential,\u201d Plaza said.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence, or GenAI, will shift workplace dynamics in favor of versatile generalists who can skillfully use AI tools to their strategic advantage, according to Mark Mader, president and CEO of Smartsheet, a workplace collaboration software maker. He said that while demand for specialized AI roles will continue, workers should look for more organizations valuing nontechnical talent that can effectively harness AI to enhance productivity, ushering in a \u201crenaissance age for the generalist.\u201d In such an age, the future of work might involve repetitive tasks becoming streamlined, freeing up knowledge workers to focus more on creative, strategic work.\n\n\u201cOrganizations have spent a disproportionate amount of capital hiring hyper-specialized talent with deep technical knowledge for years,\u201d Mader said in an email. \u201cNow, with the democratization of GenAI, the value offered by hiring \u2018capable generalists\u2019 is on the rise. People who articulately frame their thoughts, pose well-formed questions (prompts) and exercise AI tools to their advantage stand to benefit greatly.\u201d\n\nDemand for specialized AI talent \u2013 model developers, AI ops talent, and engineers to build and maintain infrastructure \u2013 will persist in 2025, according to Mader. However, the demand for nontechnical talent may shift to a more balanced state. \u201cOrganizations will place as much worth on employees with the skills to extract value from platforms as those who build them,\u201d Mader said."

Musk's ally and fellow PayPal Mafia member David Sacks was recently appointed as Trump's AI and crypto czar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Sacks was tapped for the position, OpenAI chief Sam Altman \u2014 with whom Musk has a long-running feud \u2014 took to X to congratulate him on the role. Musk responded with a laughing emoji.\n\nFriar's comments follow Altman's remarks at The New York Times' DealBook summit last week, in which he said he didn't think Musk would use his political power to his advantage and boost his own AI startup, xAI.\n\nHe said, \"I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power to the degree that Elon would hurt competitors and advantage his own businesses.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk has been embroiled in a legal battle with OpenAI since March after twice suing the company behind ChatGPT.

            "article_content": "Machine learning algorithms are a powerful tool for detecting anomalies in network traffic structure. In this way they can support the early identification of potential attacks But what is anomaly detection? Anomaly detection works by identifying patterns that deviate from anticipated behavior or normal baseline data, which can be indicative of a threat or cyberattack.\n\nThese anomalies could indicate fraudulent behavior or system failures in finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and cybersecurity, for example. By being able to detect these anomalies, organizations can protect themselves from attacks, or stop threats before they even occur, while keeping their data and systems safe. Think of it like an early warning system. Once the alarm is triggered by an anomaly, security teams can get to work, responding proactively to any issue.\n\nBear in mind that the amount of data that organizations handle is enormous. Network usage continues to grow, which means the volume of information being generated across those networks is also rising. Firewalls and antivirus software are not enough to protect networks.\n\nSophisticated attackers can infiltrate networks for long periods of time and cause damage.\n\nBy using machine learning tools, organizations can flag anomalies or outliers that could be overlooked in large datasets. Unlike signature-based detection, which relies on known attack signatures, these tools rely on meta tags and labels to automatically identify deviation.To be effective though, tools capable of detecting anomalies need high-quality data and models.\n\nAll Kinds of Anomalies\n\nThere are different kinds of anomalies of course. Three anomalies that an organization should be familiar with are point anomalies, contextual anomalies, and collective anomalies.\n\nA point anomaly is self explanatory. This occurs when an individual data point differs from the rest of the dataset. This could be a spoke in network traffic. An example of a point anomaly could be for example an unusual charge on a credit card, or use of that credit card in an unusual location. That could alert organizations to the possibility that the charge might be fraudulent.\n\nWith contextual anomalies, an individual data point is different from the rest of the dataset, but within a specific context. If a user logs into a system during non-business hours or from an IP address that doesn\u2019t match their geographic location, this could be a conextual anomaly.\n\nCollective anomalies occur when a group of data points differ from an anticipated pattern. An example of this could be a surge in network traffic from IP addresses that could be a coordinated attack.\n\nHow Can Machine Learning Help?\n\nMachine learning and AI have a big role to play in anomaly detection. They are ideal for identifying patterns in large datasets in real-time, as well as for spotting anomalies. A machine learning model could analyze network traffic patterns and identify deviations, such as surges in volume, attempted intrusions, or suspicious requests, for example. This eye for pattern recognition is key.\n\nLarge datasets, such as the ones generated from an enterprise network, exhibit complex behavior that traditional systems may struggle to identify. AI-powered solutions that rely on an effective data architecture, however, excels in recognizing patterns, learning from them, and accurately identifying any deviations or anomalies. Its ability to analyze network traffic in real-time can also improve the speed with which security teams react. For instance, in a network, an algorithm might flag a jump in login attempts. The system could then turn on its automated defenses, such as blocking questionale IP addresses. This helps to address threats.\n\nMachine learning models can adapt to identify new patterns, as they learn as the data is generated. Each time, actually, there is an attack on a network, machine learning models can make related changes by automatically incorporating new attack vectors in their detection algorithms. As such, defenses are expanded. This differs from rules-based models, where responses would have to be adjusted manually with every attack.\n\nThey also offer something called proactive anomaly management, in that they might predict where anomalies might occur in the future by observing changes in patterns over time. This is accomplished through closed-loop automation, where machine learning can correct issues as they arise. This happens thanks to a feedback loop of communication between monitoring, identifying, adjusting, and optimizing the performance of the network to enable self-optimization.\n\nRelying on such tools, false positives can also be avoided too, as machine learning can be trained to differentiate between normal changes in network traffic and real security threats. Sometimes the volume of data transfers might genuinely spike compared to baseline behavior, but machine learning will be able to distinguish between normal spikes and suspicious activities.\n\nFinally, machine learning tools are scalable and save users money over time. Rather than hiring big teams to do the grunt work, machine learning models can take over, freeing up time for the security team to focus on higher-level tasks.\n\nTaken together, your cybersecurity efforts will greatly benefit from machine learning-based anomaly detection. It helps to identify unusual network traffic, which could signify a cyber-attack or data breach. Early detection allows for quick responses, minimizing damage. It also improves operational efficiency while assisting with proactive risk management and decision making.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nOleg Bondarchuk is a Microsoft Azure Certified Solution Architect Expert with over 18 years of IT experience, including more than nine years of specialized experience in designing and supporting Microsoft Azure environments, also he holds IEEE Senior Member status .

The independent Syrian-run organization, which is based in Britain and collates information from multiple sources, said that it had verified another 110,343 deaths of people who were not named, bringing the total of civilians and combatants killed throughout the war to 617,910.\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights, another independent human rights organization that has been tracking the toll since the start of the conflict, had counted a total of 231,495 civilian deaths through June.\n\nWhat does the United Nations say?\n\nThe Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights last released an accounting in 2021, when it estimated that at least 580,000 people had been killed to that point, including 350,209 \u201cidentified individuals.\u201d The U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, cautioned at the time that the figure was \u201cnot a complete number of conflict-related killings\u201d but that it indicated a \u201cminimum verifiable number, and is certainly an undercount of the actual number.\u201d\n\nBefore 2021, the United Nations had not released a report on deaths in Syria since 2014 because it said conditions on the ground made accurate documentation impossible. However, when the war reached its 10th year, the organization responded to the need for updated information with a new report. By then, the war had shifted from large-scale military hostilities to regional clashes between multiple armed groups, making access and accuracy even more complicated, so the U.N. stopped reporting numbers.\n\nHow is the death toll calculated?\n\nThe U.N. and the Syrian human rights organizations say they rely on on-the-ground interviews, news reports and publicly available information such as death certificates and hospital records. They then identify and exclude duplicates and records with only partial information from the total and check the results against other statistical estimates.\n\nCases where people had been taken into government custody with no documentation \u2014 the forcibly disappeared \u2014 are not part of the total, nor are cases in which victims are killed and their bodies not recovered.\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights focuses on tallying civilian deaths. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also tracks deaths among the Syrian military, rebel factions, foreign militias and armed units sent by other governments that are party to the conflict, such as Israel, Russia and Iran.\n\nWill we ever know the final toll?\n\nThe end of the conflict will bring some clarity. When Damascus fell on Dec. 8, rebel groups opened Syria\u2019s prisons, freeing thousands of surviving detainees to the relief of friends and families. But thousands of other people remain missing.\n\nFadel Abdul Ghany, the founder of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, has counted more than 100,000 men, women and children who were \u201cforcibly disappeared\u201d by the Assad regime since 2011 and who were not included in any death toll. So far, he says, very few have emerged from the prisons, and he has been able to identify only about 3,000 death certificates.\n\nBased on what he has seen from the jails and the documents his team has obtained, Mr. Ghany estimated that at least 85,000 of those forcibly disappeared have been killed in al-Assad\u2019s detention centers."

            "article_content": "Russia is already at war with the west. It has been so since its occupation of Crimea in 2014, when Russia sought to secure its access to Sevastopol as a base for its Black Sea Fleet and as a potential lever of influence over Kyiv\u2019s political direction.\n\nEven in 2014 \u2013 at the annual Valdai security conference \u2013 Vladimir Putin was referencing an escalation towards conflict with the west. He later described the west as having \u201ccrossed a line\u201d.\n\nPutin signalled at the time that he was prepared to escalate further and threaten wider military conflict, but mostly the west ignored those messages. It\u2019s taken a long time for Nato and many western nations to realise their significance, and to understand that they are dealing with a continual escalation.\n\nToday Putin has five main reasons for being on a war footing and seeing Russia as in a conflict with the west. These are: the incremental enlargement of Nato and the EU towards Russian borders; western financial and military support for Ukraine to resist the 2022 full-scale invasion; anti-Russian rhetoric and international sanctions on Russian goods; measures to restrict Russian use of the international banking system; and, most recently, Ukraine\u2019s allies allowing the firing into Russia of long-range missiles\n\nThere have been plenty of indications of the Kremlin\u2019s mindset over the intervening years. For instance, in November 2022, Putin said: \u201cOur armed forces \u2026 are fighting on the line of contact that is over 1,000 kilometers long, fighting not only against neo-Nazi units but actually the entire military machine of the collective west\u201d.\n\nIn October 2023 Russian security council deputy chair, Dmitry Medvedev, described the supporters of Ukraine as \u201cactively pushing us towards World War III\u201d. In January 2024 Russia foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, described Russia as the liberator from a revived second world war axis, and suggested that it was tackling another rise in Nazism.\n\nRussia labels different kinds of confrontation according to geographical reach and intensity. At the lowest end of its scale is \u201carmed conflict\u201d. This happens within a single territorial area, such as Chechnya.\n\nOne notch above is a local war. In 2014 the initial movement of the unbadged \u201cgreen men\u201d (Russian soldiers) into Crimea was to maintain deniability but was clearly an act of war. So in many ways at this stage, Ukraine was a local war.\n\nA local war has limited military and political goals and usually takes place over a short period such as in the 2008 Russo-Georgian war, but can also involve repercussions for allies of the states at war. The next two levels of Russian war are regional wars and large-scale wars.\n\nIn regional wars several states work in coalition to secure strategically important military and political goals (such as the Soviet Union\u2019s military engagement in Afghanistan 1979-89, and the 1990-91 Gulf War, which did not involve Russia). It is likely that Russia has seen the Ukraine conflict as a regional war since 2022, with some elements of a large-scale war.\n\nLarge scale war not far off?\n\nHowever, the next level of war \u2013 the \u201clarge-scale war\u201d \u2013 may not be far off. These are wars between coalitions of states: for example, Ukraine and Nato against Russia, Iran, North Korea and China, or a wide number of countries in different parts of the world (such as the second world war). Large-scale wars create \u201cradical military political change\u201d, with intensified fighting and spread. These tend to involve a massive mobilisation of resources.\n\nThese coalitions are not yet in direct conflict with each other, but there has been large-scale mobilisation of weaponry and forces in Russia and Ukraine. North Korea has recently sent 10,000 troops to Russia.\n\nFor the west, large-scale war would significantly increase the risk of nuclear war, cause stock market volatility, cost significantly more money, and subject European citizens to the instability via a large number of physical and cyber attacks.\n\nEuropean policymakers and citizens need to understand more about key Russian aims (such as creating a buffer zone with the EU, or securing the lands it sees as Russian). In doing so, the public will know which politicians are \u2013 in effect \u2013 serving and opposing Putin\u2019s strategic agenda.\n\nRussia has strongly signalled that recent changes in US and British policy, in allowing their long range missiles to be fired into Russia, as escalatory. For example the secretary of the Russian security council, Sergei Shoigu, has said: \u201cWhen the situation \u2026 is not in favour of the Kyiv regime, the West is faced with a choice \u2013 to continue financing it and destroying the Ukrainian population or to recognise the current realities and start negotiating.\u201d\n\nRussia amended its nuclear doctrine in November and then proceeded to fire a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile into Ukraine, bringing it closer to direct conflict with Nato countries. The Russian response to these changes is driving the escalation. Meanwhile, Russian-linked sabotage and espionage operations continue across the globe.\n\nEurope starts to prepare\n\nBelatedly, the Europe and the US are starting to understand that Russia already sees itself at war with the west, even if limited currently.\n\nCountries closest to Russia, such as Sweden, Norway, Finland and Lithuania, have understood this most keenly. Politically, they have sought to align more closely with Nato and European military allies, to actively repel Russian interference. And it\u2019s worth noting that Russian military resources have been stretched by assisting Syria to tackle ongoing insurgent attacks.\n\nBut overall Europe has been fundamentally weakened by decades of under-investment in defence, its inability to coordinate defence and security policy and its over-reliance on the US as its security guarantee.\n\nThere is limited public willingness to spend more money on defence in Europe. The damage done to European politics by Russian political interference and the rise of pockets of far-right populist groups have also made collective European responses hard to muster.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBut it\u2019s important to remember that the EU is better resourced than Russia, with a stronger technology and innovation sector. The Ukrainians have also shown what can be achieved in drone warfare to hold back vastly superior Russian numbers and artillery fire.\n\nEurope needs to manufacture high-end innovations at scale, something it is capable of doing.\n\nDisrupting Russia\u2019s base of support will also be important. Taking steps to prevent military transfers from Iran, North Korea and China are crucial, as is disrupting the ability of the Russian military-industrial complex to function.\n\nOverall, increased understanding of Russian intentions, motivations and capabilities is vital in the west. This could help avoid further escalation into a large-scale war, or, at least, improve its ability to negotiate with Putin."

By creating a shortlist of potential devices, you'll be ready to seize discounts when they appear.\n\nSignificant discounts are rare when shopping for a Mac, but third-party sellers often offer lower prices. For Windows PCs , there are numerous opportunities for discounts, especially on older models or less supply-constrained devices. Monitoring prices for a few months can help you spot the best available deals, allowing you to purchase when the price drops."

The PC-21s will serve as advanced fixed-wing training aircraft. The contract includes Pilatus supplying supporting equipment, including mission planning and debriefing systems, and training materials.\n\n\u201cThe PC-21 really is the ideal advanced trainer for the Air Force and we at SkyAlyne are excited to be deploying it as part of the FAcT program,\u201d said Harrison Ruess, SkyAlyne\u2019s head of communications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s state-of-the-art, it\u2019s utilized by several other militaries, and undoubtedly it\u2019s going to serve Canada well for many years to come.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year FAcT program contract was awarded to SkyAlyne in spring 2024 and is currently in a five-year transition period to become the sole pilot and aircrew training program for the RCAF, as the three current separate RCAF training programs conclude and their responsibilities are combined into FAcT. The FAcT program is overseen from a Joint Management Office at SkyAlyne\u2019s Ottawa headquarters, with three operational bases: Moose Jaw, SK, Southport, MB, and Winnipeg, MB.\n\nSkyAlyne was formed through a partnership between CAE and KF Aerospace, which in turn are SkyAlyne\u2019s major subcontractors.\n\nTracy Medve, board chair of SkyAlyne and president/CEO of KF Aerospace, said \u201cThe PC-21 is one of the world\u2019s most capable and reliable training aircraft, expertly built and supported by Pilatus. Its versatility allows it to serve in a dual role as both a general advanced live flying trainer and in advanced jet training, which provides Canada with excellent value and offers a unique advantage for the FAcT program. We\u2019re thrilled to partner with Pilatus to deliver this exceptional platform for Canada\u2019s next generation of aircrew training.\u201d\n\nThe 23 Grob aircraft were confirmed on Nov. 19. The Grob G 120TPs are an upgraded version of the Grob G 120As, which are currently in use by KF Aerospace and the RCAF for military pilot training. The TP variant features updated avionics, higher performance, and a more powerful turboprop engine.\n\n\u201cPart of the Future Aircrew Training program includes infrastructure construction for new facilities to support the new fleet of aircraft that are coming,\u201d explained Ruess. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re in the design phase of the infrastructure work, and working diligently on that, with construction activities aiming to begin in the next 12 to 18 months on the base at 15 Wing.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) emerged in 2014 as a way to help organizations embrace the cloud and quickly became a hot commodity. As years passed new technologies like secure access service edge (SASE) and generative artificial intelligence (genAI) burst onto the scene, and SD-WAN has fallen out of the industry limelight. This shift has spawned think pieces about the death of SD-WAN and has many asking: \u201cIs SD-WAN still relevant today?\u201d\n\nAt Fortinet, we\u2019re here to tell you that SD-WAN is not only still relevant but more indispensable than ever before.\n\nWhy SD-WAN is still critical to the enterprise\n\nSD-WAN connects users, applications, and data across locations within a hybrid environment. Gartner predicts that 70% of enterprises will have implemented SD-WANs by 2026, up from around 45% in 2021.1 While SD-WAN is a maturing market, it\u2019s an increasingly important component of any network. Here\u2019s why:\n\nSD-WAN is a cornerstone of SASE\n\nSASE, critical technology that secures and supports globally dispersed workforces, consists of two parts: SD-WAN and Secure Service Edge (SSE). Since SD-WAN is a key component of SASE, any discussion of SASE by default touches on SD-WAN. And organizations often use their existing SD-WAN solution as the foundation on which to build a SASE deployment, making it particularly important to get SD-WAN right. In fact, Gartner predicts \u201cby 2027, 65% of new software-defined wide-area network (SD-WAN) purchases will be part of a single-vendor SASE offering, an increase from 20% in 2024.\u201d\n\nEscalating network complexity puts SD-WAN to the test\n\nModern networks are expanding in size and complexity, from edge computing to multi-cloud strategies. As a result, SD-WAN deployments must also grow to keep business humming. To accommodate increased traffic, more edges, and dispersed users, modern SD-WAN solutions need to have top-of-the-line performance, resiliency, scalability, and autonomous architecture options. The increasing demand for SD-WAN and its continued evolution highlights its importance.\n\nDowntime hurts business operations\n\nDowntime is no longer an option for digital-first organizations given the financial and reputational repercussions. A high-performing SD-WAN solution ensures all users and systems can connect to the applications they need to ensure efficient operations. This has become so important that organizations look for self-healing SD-WAN solutions. In fact, one of the most impactful genAI integrations is to enhance and simplify SD-WAN configuration and troubleshooting to increase uptime and availability. Specifically, genAI within SD-WAN enables organizations to quickly discover and understand where issues persist for quick resolution.\n\nProviding flexibility to meet evolving business needs\n\nModern business needs and operations evolve rapidly, and organizations are increasingly prioritizing SD-WAN solutions that provide deployment flexibility to cover many use cases, including cloud environments, on-premises users and devices, OT edges, microbranches, agentless devices, and the hybrid workforce. The demand for a flexible SD-WAN solution and its evolution to cover new demands proves its staying power.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite chatter that SD-WAN is no longer relevant, the technology remains a critical component of the modern enterprise. As a core pillar of SASE solutions, along with its ability to tackle network complexities, SD-WAN will only continue growing in importance.\n\nFortinet Secure SD-WAN enables resilient architecture and flexible deployments on-premises and in the cloud with digital experience monitoring, powerful genAI integrations, and FortiGuard AI-powered Security Services.

And I'm not talking about the football. There's been some crazy things going on,' Rodgers began. 'There's been some drones in the sky in Jersey.'\n\nMcAfee then showed a clip on an unidentified large object hovering above Bedminster, New Jersey with blue, green and red flashing lights.\n\nAaron Rodgers has offered yet another conspiracy theory on the extra-terrestrial\n\nThe Jets quarterback discussed mysterious drone activity above New Jersey on Pat McAfee\n\n'What the hell is that?' Rodgers continued, before highlighting that the mysterious sighting came above Bedminster where both president-elect Donald Trump owns a golf course and Jets owner Woody Johnson lives.\n\nThe four-time MVP did admit it could be Trump flying in for a quick round of golf but, of course, it wouldn't be Aaron Rodgers without a conspiracy theory.\n\n'Maybe it's some kids messing around\u2026maybe not, though,' he hinted.\n\n'I'm thinking about having a Friday night 5E experience,' he added, leaving the panel bewildered.\n\n'It's where you have a big kind of meditation circle and then you call in the aliens and you use little green lasers to bring them in,' the NFL veteran explained.\n\nIt wasn't the first time that the former Super Bowl winner has discussed extra-terrestrial experiences.\n\nDuring last season's 'Hard Knocks' series focusing on the Jets, Rodgers claimed he experienced a UFO sighting in 2005.\n\nHe said he was at former Cal teammate Steve Levy's house in New Jersey shortly before he was taken by the Green Bay Packers in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft when the sighting occurred.\n\nThe 41-year-old has previously opened up on an experience with a UFO sighting\n\nThe Jets are officially out of the playoffs with a 3-10 record, following last week's slate\n\nRodgers, who has publicly admitted to using hallucinogen ayahuasca, said he was trying to sleep as he had a 5am wake up call the following day but was disturbed by an 'alarm going off in the distance.'\n\n'It just didn't seem like normal, and I heard some rustling downstairs,' Rodgers said on the season finale of 'Hard Knocks.'\n\n'So I got up, walk downstairs, it's a beautiful night, and [we] walked outside, and up in the clouds, we heard this sound, and we saw this tremendously large object moving through the sky. And it was like a scene out of \"Independence Day\" when the ships are coming into the atmosphere, and they're creating this, like, kind of explosion-type fire in the sky.\n\n'We saw this incredibly large object and froze, as anybody would, because, you know, what the hell is going on? Eventually, it went out of sight, and nobody said a word. We just stood frozen.\n\n'And about 30 seconds later we heard the real, recognizable sound of fighter jets that seemed to be chasing this object. Again, we just stood there in disbelief for another few minutes and nobody said a word. And we just looked at each other like, 'did we just see what we think we just saw?'\n\nRodgers said he checked the papers and watched the news in the following days but nothing was mentioned.\n\nHowever, the experience piqued his interest in UFOs, leading him to do more research into them.\n\nRodgers later discovered that the siren was from a nuclear plant around nine miles away and claimed that UFOs are often linked to nuclear energy.\n\nThe Jets quarterback is known for his outlandish theories and techniques opening up on his use of ayahuasca at the start of last season, claiming it helped him to his back-to-back MVP seasons in 2020 and 2021.\n\nHe also underwent a darkness retreat shortly after the end of the 2022 season to contemplate his NFL future."

Rodgers debuted the conspiracy, which has to do with apparent drones that have been flying over New Jersey, on The Pat McAfee Show earlier this week.\n\nAs Aaron Rodgers was discussing the drone sightings that have happened recently in New Jersey and Staten Island, Rodgers and the geniuses over at The Pat McAfee Show speculated that it could be aliens in the drones, which led the four-time NFL MVP down a tangent about wanting to have a \u201c5E experience\u201d with the aliens.\n\nThe five \u201cE\u2019s\u201d in the 5-E experience model stand for \u201cExcitement, Entry, Engagement, Exit, Extension.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about having a Friday night 5E experience.\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cIt\u2019s where you have a big kind of meditation circle and then you call in the aliens and you use little green lasers to bring them in.\u201d\n\nAs for the drones, Rodgers says there\u2019s been some \u201ccrazy stuff\u201d happening and could barely contain his grin while doing so.\n\n\u201cDo you know what\u2019s been going on in New Jersey lately? And I\u2019m not talking about the football. There\u2019s been some crazy things going on,\u201d Rodgers said as Pat McAfee\u2019s production team cued up a video of the alleged drones. McAfee suggested it was a helicopter while co-host and perpetual floating head AJ Hawk said it was an airplane.\n\n\u201cHere we go. Look at this, cued up. What the hell is that? \u2026 That\u2019s large. What is that? \u2026 I\u2019ve seen that video. Bedminster, that\u2019s home to [predident elect Donald] Trump\u2019s golf course and our owner, Woody Johnson. So who knows, maybe those guys are\u2026\u201d Rodgers said.\n\n\u201cCowboys & Aliens is an incredible movie..

            "article_content": "An email containing incredible UFO images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked online by an anonymous source.\n\nThe leaker claimed that they had accessed an alleged top secret UFO 'data retrieval program' known as 'Immaculate Constellation' \u2014 made famous this past November in a blockbuster public hearing before Congress.\n\nThe black-and-white images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube, traditional flying saucers and several other craft that look straight out of classic science fiction.\n\nThe screengrabs are said to be from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by military 'heads up displays,' but details were redacted to protect both sensitive US national security interests.\n\nThese unsettling depictions of highly varied craft were first made public by Nathan Latvaitis, who runs a YouTube channel called 'Strange Mysteries.'\n\n'This person has asked me to redact their email address,' Latvaitis told his followers, 'although I can tell you that there is nothing identifiable in it.'\n\nThe sensational images have elicited heated debate among UFO believers and skeptics alike, however, with many on both sides questioning the leaker's story.\n\nA 'creepy e-mail' containing weird, but compelling images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked by an anonymous source claiming classified access\n\nThe UFO stills are said to be screengrabs from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by US military sensors with key 'heads up display' details redacted (as seen above) to protect both sensitive America's national security interests as well as the leaker's identity\n\nOver the course of two weeks of correspondence with the leaker, Latvaitis and his followers given tantalizing, but uncorroborated details on the craft depicted.\n\n'The UAPs observed demonstrate capabilities far beyond conventional aerospace benchmarks,' the leaker said in a third update posted to YouTube on November 30th.\n\nThe so-called 'cruciform' (cross-shaped) entities, according to their account, exhibit aggressive maneuvers and high-energy emissions capable of disabling systems such as the EODAS' \u2014 a reference to the advanced sensors on the F-35 stealth fighter jet.\n\nShort for 'Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System,' EODAS is a sensor suite that give the F-35's stealth fighter pilots a 360-degree view for a 'quick, high-definition picture of everything around them,' according its manufacturer Raytheon.\n\nImproved 'missile detection' is one key goal in making EODAS, even though it may prove helpless against these purported 'cruciform' UFOs.\n\n'The 'cruciform' entity [shows] distinct behaviors indicating functional differences,' according to the self-described insider to the Immaculate Constellation program.\n\n'Shape-shifting has been observed \u2014 possibly due to advanced cloaking or optical refraction \u2014 referred to as 'morphogenic behavior,' allowing for adaptation to environments or missions,' the leaker continued.\n\nDetails were scarce on some other craft shapes, though the leaker noted nearly all 'these crafts,' like the boomerang UFOs, squares, and classic saucers 'demonstrate trans-medium travel, non-ballistic motion, and localized gravity manipulation.'\n\nAbove, an ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFO, allegedly captured by a US military plane\n\nThe stunning, unusual images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube and several craft that looks straight out of science fiction\n\nAbove, another cruciform (cross-shaped) UFO from the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nWhile many of these UFOs emit electromagnetic 'signatures that disrupt ISR [intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance] systems causing sensor malfunctions' on human-made systems, they said, one broad category was less disruptive.\n\n''Orb'-class UAPs focus on surveillance with minimal EMF [electro-magnetic frequency] interference,' according to the leaker.\n\nSpeaking to NASA last year, ex-CIA physicist Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, then head of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), said: 'We see these ['metallic orbs'] all over the world.'\n\nDr Kirkpatrick, a career laser and optical physicist, called these orbs the most commonly reported type of UFO to AARO's team.\n\n'And we see these making very interesting apparent maneuvers,' he added.\n\nBut 'cruciform' UFO shapes were not called out by name in his report to NASA, which did note that seven percent of sightings fell into miscellaneous 'other' shapes.\n\nIn his email to Latvaitis, the leaker asserted that he selected the YouTuber over more mainstream journalism outlets specifically to avoid having to verify his own claims.\n\n'Many traditional media outlets would require verification of my identity and credentials,' the leaker told Latvaitis in his email, shown in a Strange Mysteries video.\n\nAbove a boomerang UFO included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nTwo cross-shaped UFOs as alleged by the leaker, in the crosshairs of a military aircraft\n\n'This is not feasible due to the risks involved,' the leaked explained. '[Those news media] organizations, despite their best intentions, are not equipped to handle the level of secrecy and potential retaliation associated with this information.'\n\nThe leaker described their motives as desire to inform on important information that has been 'classified and intentionally withheld from the public regarding 'unidentified aerial phenomena' [UAP] and the ongoing covert operations surrounding them.'\n\n'I was part of one of the legacy programs,' the leaker wrote. 'I know that's vague, but unfortunately that's all I can offer at this point.'\n\nMultiple UFO 'true believers' on social media expressed doubt over the leakers story, particularly the unknown individuals response to that skepticism.\n\nOne UFO has been dubbed the ceiling fan, in part, by skeptics who believe that the image depicts a genuine household ceiling fan - and not a five-bladed advanced aerospace platform\n\nAbove, a strange 'hot cube' UFO image included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nThe mixed orientation of some images suggested 'they were probably scanned from a print out,' and the images varied in terms of their 'detailed sensor noise' and subtle software response to motion blur.\n\n'In my opinion, this has the variety I would expect to see from a collection of images captured on different platforms over the years,' the user posted to Reddit's r/UFOs.\n\nOn the skeptics' forum Metabunk many dismissed the videos as too low information to properly vet or investigate, with some claiming it might have been release as a premeditated disinformation effort.\n\n'Not worth wasting time on unless they can (and do!) back up their story,' one typical comment read.\n\n'It takes seconds to make another picture and hours to try and debunk it.'\n\nThe 'Immaculate Constellation' program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November 2024 and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public. Above a still from the alleged new leak\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs (second at right)\n\nBut whistleblowers continue to claim that 'Immaculate Constellation' was, in fact, established to 'detect' and 'quarantine' the military's best UFO imagery, as well as its best videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis high quality, multi-sensor UFO data, according to a US official who confirmed the leak, is so tightly held that 'talking about it will put you in the danger zone.'\n\nThe quite literally 'above top secret' program allegedly sprang into action in the wake of the 2017 leak of three, still-as-yet unexplained US Navy infrared UFO videos, although it is still unconfirmed, resting the gray area of speculation.\n\nThe program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public.\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs.\n\nAbove, two additional alleged UFO images that the leaker to Strange Mysteries said came from Immaculate Constellation\n\nIn one stunning case, detailed in the 11-page report, infrared satellites captured a massive saucer-shaped UFO emerging from within a dense cloud formation.\n\nThe saucer's circumference was estimated to be between 650 and 1,300 feet, which would place its diameter between roughly 200 and 400 feet.\n\nIt also 'displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface,' the report reads.\n\nThe saucer registered hot in the infrared footage, and created visible 'atmospheric disturbances.'\n\nThe object emerged from the cloud formation at a shallow angle and travelled upwards toward the outer atmosphere."

            "article_content": "Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.\n\nAstronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.\n\nThe three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.\n\nBecause the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.\n\nWHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED\n\nThe team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.\n\nHis team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.\n\nThe team carried out their research focusing on the coldest regions of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or minus (-)257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide.\n\nCarbon Monoxide is key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY\n\nWhile scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and have also carried out research on binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique. The GG Tau A star system being located in our cosmic neighbourhood also helps answer key questions in astrophysics.\n\nIt helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravitational force of three host stars.\n\nGravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure, and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge as well as an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.\n\nTHE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE\n\nThe astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.\n\nThe facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.\n\nThe APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.\n\nThe ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n"

            "article_content": "In November 1924, French physicist Louis de Broglie presented his revolutionary theory that has become one of the cornerstones of quantum physics.\n\nFive years after presenting his revolutionary theory, in 1929, Louis de Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking contribution, which remains fundamental to modern quantum mechanics and its numerous applications.\n\nThibault Damour, an Emeritus Professor of Physics at the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques (IHES), explained the profound impact of de Broglie\u2019s work, describing it as a generalization of Albert Einstein\u2019s earlier insights into the dual nature of light.\n\nEinstein had associated particle-like properties with the wave-like nature of light, while de Broglie\u2019s breakthrough involved the reverse: associating wave-like properties with matter.\n\n\u201cDe Broglie made the reverse discovery of Einstein by associating waves to matter,\u201d Damour said.\n\nThis groundbreaking idea marked a crucial step in the evolution of quantum mechanics. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, inspired by de Broglie\u2019s hypothesis through Einstein, later developed the famous Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which describes the propagation of matter waves.\n\nThis Schr\u00f6dinger-de Broglie equation is now recognized as one of the foundational equations of quantum mechanics, underpinning countless scientific advancements and practical technologies.\n\nDamour further highlighted the widespread applications of de Broglie\u2019s theory. The concept of wave-like properties in matter has been instrumental in the development of solid-state physics.\n\n\n\nRead more on RFI English\n\n\n\nRead also:\n\nFran\u00e7ois Arago: The scientist and statesman who shaped science and society\n\nTangled future of quantum computing explained by French Nobel winner\n\nFrom The Lab: Building quantum computing systems, one photon at a time"

            "article_content": "Most of us are aware of the deep problems in the current US pharmaceutical industry. Yet few may realize that today\u2019s issues stem from changes that occurred centuries ago.\n\nAs I explain in The Apothecary\u2019s Wife: The Hidden History of Medicine and How it Became a Commodity, the current medication system was established between 1650 and 1740, when professionals used the scientific revolution to push women out of the medical space. At that time, domestic medicine was dominant. Women were the primary sources of medicine in their communities, making medication from organic ingredients at home. Despite using the exact same ingredients for their own medicines, apothecaries and physicians persuaded the public of the superiority of their treatments and began charging for them. Medicinal substances transformed from free, household goods for everyone into commodities available only to those with means. This transformation normalized the practice of withholding life-saving medications from people who could not afford it \u2014 and valuing the economic success of corporations over the lives of some citizens.\n\nThe forces that transformed medication into a commodity are still with us. For example, domestic medicine encouraged sharing recipes to maximize healing, but today\u2019s commercial medicine attempts to keep recipes secret to maximize profit. The US patent system and the battles between corporations making generic and brand-name drugs is a logical result, even when those mechanisms imperil patients\u2019 health and lives. (See also Victor Roy\u2019s Capitalizing a Cure: How Finance Controls the Price and Value of Medicines.)\n\nRegulation is another legacy of medication\u2019s economic transformation. In an attempt to exclude quacks from the medical marketplace and to protect consumers, 17th- and 18th-century professionals began testing competitors\u2019 medicines to prove their inferiority and then publicizing the results. Joshua Ward (ca. 1685-1761), for instance, widely sold \u201cmedications\u201d made of metals such as lead and antimony despite knowing that ingesting them could be fatal (Chapter 7 in The Apothecary\u2019s Wife has a lot to say about him). Regulatory entities such as the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency should do this work now. History provides ample proof that when guided by science, regulation works. It has also shown us that lax oversight, such as in the famous case of thalidomide, the furor over aduhelm, and today\u2019s generic drug industry, endangers patients.\n\nWe also continue to experience the fallout from the campaign to elevate \u201cthe New Science.\u201d Its 17- and 18-century advocates made it seem more impressive by casting this new way of thinking and discovering as too difficult for ordinary people. That strategy generated an ongoing suspicion of science and a profound misunderstanding of how science functions. Although particularly virulent in the United States, this skepticism and ignorance of science abounds worldwide.\n\nFor the United States, this legacy will be even more obvious and determinative after the new government is sworn in on January 20, 2025. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) is America\u2019s only attempt so far at a public health system. For decades, the Republican party on the whole has been opposed to the ACA and national health care more broadly, drawing on the value system that displaced domestic medicine\u2019s ethos with one that prioritizes corporate health over human health. 17- and 18-century professionals recognized this issue in converting medication into a commodity, but decided against adding a mechanism for treating the impoverished. Repealing the ACA would be returning to the three-hundred-year-old roots of today\u2019s system. Similarly, the current nominee to lead the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Mehmet Oz, has pursued profit opportunities in medicine with disregard for science and the health of ordinary people. He has even promoted colloidal silver (more upscale than Joshua Ward, but an equally ancient claim). It is likely that the provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requiring the CMS to negotiate the prices that it pays for pharmaceuticals will be ignored or removed.\n\nSkepticism and suspicion of science undoubtedly will bear down on federal divisions, departments, and institutes responsible for health care and science. Regulation is a probable early casualty. The nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., harbors these views, exemplified by his opposition to vaccines, fluoridated water, and pasteurized milk. Kennedy\u2019s misunderstanding of how science works, not to mention the role of regulation, leads to a hostility toward scientists that has much in common with witchcraft fears. History suggests that under such leadership, HHS and the CMS will authorize the use of unscientifically tested treatments, reject the scientific foundations of the regulation process, and nurture a national hostility to science and scientists.\n\nThe consequences of this approach will appear quickly. Federal opposition to vaccines, for instance, will swiftly raise the mortality rate, especially the infant and child mortality rates, to spectacular highs. As Olivia Craighead drily wrote after Mehmet Oz\u2019s nomination, \u201cFingers crossed colloidal silver works for measles.\u201d Outbreaks of easily prevented, highly communicable, frequently fatal or permanently debilitating diseases such as measles and pertussis (whooping cough) will likely negatively impact the economy. Tourism will drop as visitors choose to avoid such a perilous environment. The national failure to provide a reliably healthy, sound workforce will curtail domestic productivity and obstruct foreign investment.\n\nPrognostication in this case is fairly easy. Addressing these values and beliefs about the role of medication is not. They are rooted in medication\u2019s transformation into a commodity. Knowing where these ideas came from, however, offers insight into the current system, and as history shows, insight is a step toward action."
