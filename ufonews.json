        "article_content": "Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&A on NewsNation\u2019s YouTube, X and Facebook pages at 4p/3C today following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. Shellenberger will join Elizabeth Vargas Reports at 5p/4C to recap today\u2019s hearing. Find out how to watch at JoinNN.com.\n\n(NewsNation) \u2014 At a House of Representatives committee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena Wednesday, lawmakers are hearing from a number of witnesses about what they have seen and heard about UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d opened with Rep. Nancy Mace, R- S.C., laying out the goals including finding out the extent of Pentagon programs investigating UAPs and any information that may have been recovered, including any information or lack thereof on alien life or technology of non-human origin.\n\nMace noted a lack of trust in agencies including the Defense Department due to a reluctance by those entities to declassify information.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to investigate these phenomena, we must do so with the mind of protecting our country, advancing scientific discovery and upholding the trust of the American people, who right now I don\u2019t think have trust, which is obvious. I don\u2019t have trust,\u201d said Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisc.\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., also addressed the stigma around the subject, pointing to a lack of official information that pushed UFOs and UAPs to the fringes.\n\n\u201cA void of information has allowed conspiracy theories to fester,\u201d Moskowitz said.\n\nWitnesses decry culture of secrecy around UFOs\n\nRetired Navy Rear Adm. Timothy Gallaudet said in his opening statement that he first became aware of UAPs during his career as a meteorologist with the Navy and pushed back against secrecy about UAPs.\n\n\u201cWe should boldly face this new reality and learn from it,\u201d Gallaudet said.\n\nHe also said he felt a moral obligation to come forward and vouch for the credibility of whistleblowers who have come forward with their UAP experiences, many of whom have faced ridicule for their claims.\n\nPentagon insider Luis Elizondo accused a small group of government insiders of keeping the truth about UAPs from the public.\n\n\u201cExcessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public, all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked directly if the government has secret UAP craft retrieval programs, Elizondo gave an unequivocal yes but declined to answer if he had been read into such programs in a public setting.\n\nFormer NASA administrator Michael Gold pushed back against stigma about UAPs, noting that it discourages scientific efforts to determine what is happening.\n\nWhat have we learned about UAPs?\n\nLuis Elizondo, a former Pentagon insider, veteran and investigator; retired Navy Rear Adm. Timothy Gallaudet; journalist Michael Shellenberger and Michael Gold, a former NASA administrator, are scheduled to give their testimony.\n\nThis hearing is the first since the summer of 2023, which was sparked by career intelligence official David Grusch\u2018s allegations that the Pentagon has been operating a secret UFO retrieval program.\n\n\u201cIf the UFO hearings catch on with the public, we could be in for quite a ride,\u201d Bryce Zabel, UFO author and cohost of the podcast \u201cNeed to Know\u201d with Ross Coulthart, told NewsNation. \u201cBack in 1973, all of America was riveted to the Senate Watergate hearings, and the cover-up Nixon orchestrated will seem small compared to the one that would have been necessary to hide the truth about alien contact for nearly eight decades now.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re gonna learn some things\u2019 about UFOs: Rep. Tim Burchett\n\nElizondo\u2019s book \u201cImminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt for UFOs\u201d alleges that the United States military has been running a UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program for years, even recovering nonhuman specimens.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: UAP are real. Advanced technologies not made by our Government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe,\u201d Elizondo will say, according to testimony published the day before the hearing.\n\nHe will talk about what actions the government should be taking regarding the UAP issue.\n\nGallaudet, in his testimony, plans to repeat a claim he\u2019s made before to NewsNation: that an email that contained what is known as the \u201cGo Fast\u201d video, disappeared from his and his colleagues\u2019 email servers. \u201cGo Fast\u201d shows a fighter pilot\u2019s encounter with a UAP.\n\nWhat is Immaculate Constellation?\n\nShellenberger will detail his reporting on the alleged \u201cImmaculate Constellation\u201d secret government program. A whistleblower revealed the alleged UFO program, in which the Pentagon collects and quarantines information on UFO sightings, Shellenberger says.\n\nDepartment of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough has previously denied records of the program.\n\nThe \u2018tic tac\u2019 incident: What we know about the UFO encounter\n\nShellenberger will highlight the need for Congress and the White House to address UFOs.\n\nMichael Gold, a former NASA administrator, will outline new ways for NASA to be helpful on the UAP issue. Currently Chief Growth Office at Redwire Space, Gold stresses in his testimony that he is speaking on his own behalf, and not for any other organization.\n\n\u201cAgencies such as NASA have much to offer when it comes to understanding UAP,\u201d Gold\u2019s prepared testimony reads.\n\nUFO Whistleblower Sparks Conversation\n\nMuch of the current conversation surrounding UFOs started when Grusch came forward last year with his claims that the government was operating a secret program dedicated to retrieving crashed UAPs and was in possession of nonhuman craft and biological remains of nonhuman beings.\n\nThe Defense Department has denied these allegations.\n\nStill, they sparked the 2023 congressional hearing on the subject \u2014 the first in more than 50 years \u2014where Grusch testified with former Navy pilot Ryan Graves and Navy Commander David Fravor.\n\nFravor talked about his experience encountering a UAP. Both Graves and Fravor said they were concerned about the risks UAPs pose to the military, regardless of origin.\n\nNetflix faces lawsuit over \u2018The Manhattan Alien Abduction\u2019\n\nLawmakers asked about the secret program referenced by Grusch, and eventually, the hearing led to the formation of a bipartisan UFO Caucus, informally led by Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\nAn official report issued by the Pentagon from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office found no evidence of a secret program. Furthermore, it said the government has no evidence that UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin. However, the Department of Defense did admit to a proposed program known as Kona Blue, which was developed to reverse-engineer any alien technology recovered by the government. This never got off the ground, the DOD said, as no such technology was ever located.\n\nNASA, in a report of its own, said there\u2019s no evidence for extraterrestrial contact with Earth, though the agency said there needs to be more rigorous research in the area and less stigma around the topic as a whole.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Read our coverage for more details and videos from the hearing.\n\nThe U.S. government is holding another hearing on UFOs today, and you can watch it live.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representative's Committee on Oversight and Accountability will administer the hearing, titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\" The name of the event refers to UFOs by their new preferred acronym, which is more inclusive of sightings that might take place not only in the air but also in space, as well as those that take place across multiple domains.\n\nThe hearing will be held at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington D.C. at 11:30 a.m. ET (1630 GMT) on Wednesday (Nov. 13). You can watch it live here on Space.com, courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.\n\nThis marks the second congressional hearing U.S. Congress has put together in order to \"further pull back the curtain on secret UAP research programs conducted by the U.S. government, and undisclosed findings they have yielded,\" according to a House statement. The hearing will examine the U.S. Department of Defense's strict classification policies when it comes to UAP and related topics, and will explore ways to \"make sure the American public is better informed on this topic.\"\n\nThis will be a joint hearing, led by representatives Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) and Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), who argue that \"the American people are tired of the obfuscation and refusal to release information by the federal government,\" according to the House's statement.\n\n\"Americans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose. We can only ensure that understanding by providing consistent, systemic transparency. We look forward to hearing from expert witnesses on ways to shed more light and bring greater accountability to this issue,\" Mace and Grothman said in the statement.\n\nExpert witnesses in the hearing will include Luis Elizondo, a decorated former counterintelligence officer who has claimed for years that the U.S. government is hiding knowledge of UAP, including materials recovered from crashed flying saucers.\n\n\"The cover-up and disinformation campaign has been so successful that most scientists do not even know UAP are real,\" Elizondo wrote in his 2024 book \"Imminent.\" The book also claims that four \"deceased nonhuman bodies\" were recovered from the infamous 1947 crash in Roswell, New Mexico and that \"China and Russia do not have the same stigma and can employ their scientists to work on this topic for them.\"\n\nElizondo has also claimed firsthand knowledge of U.S. programs that employ individuals with psychic powers to \"remote view\" distant locations. Most recently, the former counterintelligence officer held a paid event where a photo was shown that Elizondo claimed was a \"real photo\" of a \"mothership\" UFO above a U.S. embassy. Within days, the photo was found to be the reflection of a lamp in a window.\n\nThe House hearing will also include Tim Gallaudet, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who unidentified submersible objects, arguing that \"these underwater anomalies jeopardize US maritime security.\" Gallaudet has also told interviewers that his daughter is a \"medium\" who can communicate with spirits.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n\u2014 NASA UFO report finds no evidence of 'extraterrestrial origin' for UAP sightings\n\n\u2014 UFO whistleblower tells Congress the US government is hiding evidence of 'non-human intelligence'\n\n\u2014 UFOs worth investigating despite lack of 'real evidence,' former astronaut Scott Kelly says\n\nOther speakers at the hearing include journalist Michael Shellenberger, who has also claimed the U.S. government is hiding UFO crash retrieval programs, and former NASA Associate Administrator of Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold, who is a member of NASA's independent UAP study team.\n\nAccording to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson's remarks in September 2024 when the team's report was released, \"the top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn.\"\n\n\"The NASA independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin, but we don't know what these UAP are,\" Nelson said."

The user base was larger than Baidu\u2019s Wenxiaoyan \u2013 formerly known as Ernie Bot \u2013 with 12.5 million users and Alibaba Group Holding-backed Moonshot AI\u2019s Kimi at 10 million. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nAs Beijing requires government registration of AI apps before they are made available to download onto smartphones and laptops, the Chinese market is dominated by domestic products, with little presence from globally popular apps like ChatGPT, which said it has over 180 million users.\n\nA screenshot of Doubao, the ChatGPT-like conversational bot developed by TikTok owner ByteDance.

Apart from tasks such as writing emails or summarising long texts, it also supports image, audio and video generation, data analysis, and AI-powered online search \u2013 a function that ChatGPT only recently acquired.\n\nThe wide array of capabilities has helped Doubao become the go-to AI app for Chinese consumers. ByteDance, however, has not announced any plans to monetise Doubao, even though it is costly to train such applications based on large language models.\n\nA consultant surnamed Cheng, who works in Hangzhou, said Doubao has become an effective tool for \u201cediting and improving text\u201d, and for its \u201clogical organisation of content\u201d. Zhu Jiahui, a software salesperson based in Beijing, said he is a frequent user of Doubao for its easy-to-use design despite it being feature-rich.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe app, accessible from its official website as well as on Android and iOS app stores, offers some of the most versatile capabilities among its local and global peers, according to analysts."

As early as March 2025, the iPhone maker could release a tablet that mounts to your wall, controls smart home appliances, does video calls, and of course features Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe device reportedly has a 6-inch touchscreen, but it\u2019s expected that, like a HomePod, it will use voice to control it, either through Siri, Apple Intelligence, or an upcoming system called \u201cApp Intents\u201d that lets AI control applications. It supposedly runs on a new OS, with sensors to detect how close a person is, but will have traditional Apple apps like Safari, Apple Music, Notes, and Calendar.\n\nApple\u2019s \u201ccommand center for the home\u201d seems intended as a rival to Amazon\u2019s Echo Hub and Google\u2019s Nest Hub, so expect it to be priced similarly (i.e., $100 to $250). However, Apple is also working on an iPad on a robotic arm that follows you around the room, which could cost closer to $1,000."

The scale measures the degree of belief in each of these seven categories: traditional religious belief, psi, witchcraft, superstition, spiritualism, extraordinary life forms and precognition.\n\nThese are further broken down into dimensions: The first, \u201ctraditional\u201d paranormal belief, includes religious belief and witchcraft. The second, new age philosophy, encompasses things like spiritualism, precognition and extraordinary life forms.\n\nA quarter of adults in the US consider themselves superstitious, and recent trends reveal that younger people are more superstitious than older adults.\n\nResearch team lead Kenneth Drinkwater, Ph.D., and his colleagues had 3,084 people complete the questionnaire evaluating different facets of perceived stress.\n\nTheir findings, published today in the journal PLOS ONE, revealed that those who scored higher for traditional paranormal belief reported elevated distress levels and reduced ability to manage stress.\n\nHowever, belief in new age philosophies, including psi, was not linked to increased distress and/or decreased ability to cope.\n\nEarlier research has suggested that, in general, belief in the paranormal is not linked to stress vulnerability. Yet research on superstitious belief, a subset of paranormal belief, has suggested that people rely on superstitions in stressful situations to gain an illusion of control over outcomes.\n\n3 The revised Paranormal Belief Scale differentiates between traditional superstitions and new-age philosophies.

Our ancestors\u2019 survival was threatened by predation or other natural forces.\u201d\n\nThese latest findings are in line with the idea that traditional paranormal beliefs are a response to feelings of anxiety related to an individual\u2019s lack of control over external forces.\n\nThe research team notes that this study is exploratory and does not support any causal relationship.\n\nGet the latest breakthroughs in medicine, diet & nutrition tips and more.

However, additional research is still needed to further explore these fascinating relationships in connection to perceived stress, well-being and coping styles.\u201d"

I believe there are more things in this world that we don\u2019t understand, and I don\u2019t discount the possibility at all,\u201d said Fran Walters, who has lived next door for the last 28 years.\n\n\u201cWhen I first moved out here, I\u2019d walk by there and I could not believe there was a little girl playing in the front, and I remember thinking, \u2018How could a family with little kids buy this house?'\u201d she said.\n\n5 On Nov. 13, 1947, Ronald DeFeo, 23, walked through his Amityville home and executed his sleeping family Newsday via Getty Images\n\nThe house has long attracted curiosity seekers over its claims that it is haunted, but the legends began with a real-life crime on Nov. 13, 1974.\n\nAt around 3 a.m., 23-year-old Ronald \u201cButch\u201d DeFeo rose from bed with a .35 caliber rifle in his hands and executed his parents and four siblings as they slept.\n\nHe then got dressed, and went to work. It wasn\u2019t until hours later that DeFeo burst into a neighborhood bar and claimed somebody had attacked his family.\n\nThe next year DeFeo was sentenced to life in prison, but he spent his life blaming a long list of others \u2014 at one point reportedly claiming \u201cvoices\u201d coming from the house urged him to do it.\n\nThough DeFeo was believed to be a heavy drug user, famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren \u2014 who have since been fictionalized in \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d series of movies \u2014 came to believe he was performing satanic rituals, and those voices may have been demonic forces he unleashed on the house.\n\n5 DeFeo was sentenced to life in prison, and died in 2021 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\u201cDeFeo was into Satanism,\u201d said Tony Spera, the Warrens\u2019 son-in-law, who now leads the couple\u2019s New England Society of Psychic Research. \u201cHe had a little room they called the red room because it was painted red, and there\u2019s a little cubby hole and he kept his satanic artifacts in there.\n\n\u201cThings were happening in the home,\u201d Spera told The Post. \u201cSomething was going on in that house that was nefarious, and we believe it was Ronald DeFeo Jr. doing these satanic rituals.\u201d\n\nAs DeFeo was being sentenced, George and Kathy Lutz moved into the Amityville house with their three kids at a bargain price of $80,000.\n\nOver the next 28 days, the family claimed they were harassed by a host of terrifying happenings \u2014 including levitations and visions of hags, the children sleeping face-down just as the DeFeos bodies were found, freezing temperatures while fireplaces raged, and slime oozing from walls and doors.\n\n5 Tony Spera, the son-in-law of Ed and Lorraine Warren, cautioned that the Amityville house could still be haunted Matthew McDermott\n\nThey fled the home before the month was out, and after a local news station camped out at the house for a segment the Warrens showed up to investigate \u2014 but the Lutzes reportedly refused to go back inside with them.\n\n\u201cThere was an arrangement for George to meet Ed and Lorraine at a pizza place about five blocks away from the Amityville house,\u201d Spera recounted. \u201cEd said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s go to the house and check it out.\u2019\n\n\u201cGeorge stands up, pulls out the keys to the house. He goes, \u2018Here\u2019s the keys. I\u2019m not going in that house \u2026 I\u2019m not going anywhere near that house. Do me a favor, Ed, in such-and-such a drawer there\u2019s a deed to the house. Just get me that, will you?\u2019\u201d\n\nMonths later the Lutzes inked a book deal to tell their story, with \u201cThe Amityville Horror: A Story,\u201d which came out in 1977 and was an immediate success, sparking an even more successful film and sequels.\n\nThough many wrote it off as a hoax \u2014 DeFeo\u2019s own attorney, William Weber, later claimed he and the family concocted the story over several bottles of wine \u2014 the Lutz parents stood by their story for life.\n\n5 George and Kathy Lutz stood by their haunting story their entire lives Getty Images\n\nAnd while the house has changed hands numerous times since the Lutzes left, none of the owners have ever reported any hauntings over those five decades \u2014 something Spera thinks doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the Lutzes were lying, or that whatever haunted them is really gone.\n\n\u201cEd used to not want to talk very much about it, because he said the more recognition you give to it, the more likely something would happen. It depends on the entity, too, that might be at that house. It may lay dormant for years,\u201d Spera said.\n\n\u201cThere could possibly \u2014 and I\u2019m emphasizing the word possibly \u2014 still be something dormant in that structure that could reignite with either recognition, or somebody doing rituals in the house, incantations, or a family that is susceptible to hauntings \u2014 in other words, a family that\u2019s weak-willed, or someone in the house that\u2019s weak-willed.\n\n5 The Amityville house has changed hands numerous times since 1974, but nobody has reported a haunting since Getty Images\n\n\u201cSo in other words, I can move into a house. I can make it haunted. I can make the house haunted by dabbling in occult practices, by doing witchcraft, incantations, satanic rituals, using a Ouija board in the house,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhen you do things like that, you\u2019re inviting things into your life. You\u2019re inviting the unknown in.\u201d\n\nThe current residents of the house \u2013 along with one of the Lutz children \u2013 declined to comment.\n\nAs for Walters \u2014 who \u201cmade it a point to never ever, ever watch the movie\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s ventured inside the \u201cbeautiful\u201d home once during an estate sale, but wouldn\u2019t consider living there.\n\n\u201cIn the back of my head, the Amityville Horror would always be there. You\u2019d hear a little creak in the night and it might set you off. I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said."

Unearthed was the remarkably preserved skull of a previously unknown bird species, Navaornis hestiae, from the Cretaceous Period. This discovery allowed researchers to digitally reconstruct the brain and inner ear anatomy of the ancient bird, providing significant clues to how modern avian brains, renowned for their cognitive abilities, evolved over millions of years.\n\nIn another significant development, researchers have documented catastrophic declines in African elephant populations across the continent. This comprehensive assessment, unveiled on Monday, revealed dramatic population drops of the savanna and forest elephant species. The study utilized data from population surveys at 475 sites spanning 37 countries from 1964 to 2016, painting a grim picture of these majestic mammals' plight.\n\nTogether, these findings emphasize the importance of understanding both past and present ecosystems. The fossil discovery not only enhances knowledge of avian evolution but underlines the necessity of tackling current biodiversity challenges, as evidenced by the declining numbers of African elephants, some of the planet's most intelligent and social creatures.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

She added: \u201cIt is a key finding for archaeological research for London.\u201d\n\nopen image in gallery Distinct layers could be seen and showed a solid foundation of compacted gravel sealed by two layers of chalk ( MOLA/Southwark Council )\n\nThe section of road revealed lies to the south of the junction of Old Kent Road and Ilderton Road and was well preserved, measuring about 19ft (5.8m) wide by almost 5ft (1.4m) high.\n\nSouthwark Council said distinct layers could be seen and showed a solid foundation of compacted gravel sealed by two layers of chalk, before it was topped with another layer of compacted sand and gravel.\n\nIt added that the original surface of the road would likely have been made from the same material and would have sat at a similar level to the modern road, but over time this had been lost.\n\nThe council\u2019s in-house archaeology officer Dr Chris Constable said a section of the road to the south was excavated in the early 1990s, but questions had remained over the exact course of the road until now.\n\nopen image in gallery A depiction of the road near Wall in Staffordshire. Watling Street ran from Dover to the West Midlands ( Getty )\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased this project has answered our questions over the course of the Roman road south of the Cantium Retail Park where a section was excavated in the early 1990s, south of the line of the modern road,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the planning for this project, we\u2019d expected to solve this question but the extent of survival of the road is remarkable.\u201d\n\nThe London portion of Watling Street was rediscovered during Christopher Wren\u2019s rebuilding of St Mary-le-Bow in 1671\u201373, following the Great Fire of London in 1666.\n\nThe road ran straight from the bridgehead on the Thames to what would become Newgate on the London Wall. It then passed over Ludgate Hill and the Fleet, dividing into Watling Street and the Devil\u2019s Highway west to Silchester."

        "article_content": "- The new iRAG technology mitigates hallucinations in image generation, boosting the applicability of AI-generated images.\n\n- Miaoda is a no-code tool that enables users to build applications using simple natural language.\n\n- ERNIE now handles 1.5 billion daily API calls, marking an exceptional 30-fold growth over the previous year.\n\nSHANGHAI, Nov. 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU and HKEX: 9888), a leading AI company with strong Internet foundation, today hosted its annual flagship technology conference Baidu World 2024 in Shanghai. At the event, the company announced a range of new AI technologies and solutions to accelerate the boom of AI applications, featuring iRAG (Image-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a new technology designed to tackle hallucinations in image generation, and Miaoda, a no-code tool that empowers businesses and individuals to create applications.\n\nThe launch comes amid surging demand for Baidu's AI offerings, as evidenced by the ERNIE foundation model's daily API calls reaching 1.5 billion by early November. This represents a substantial 30-fold increase from the 50 million announced a year ago.\n\n\n\nERNIE's daily API calls reach 1.5 billion by early November 2024\n\n\"The growth rate exceeded my expectations,\" said Robin Li, Co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Baidu, who described the steep increase as a reflection of the explosive growth in generative AI applications in China over the past two years.\n\n\n\nRobin Li, Co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Baidu, speaks at Baidu World 2024\n\nLooking ahead, Li emphasized that agents will serve as the predominant form of AI applications and are approaching a tipping point of explosive growth. Underscoring this point, Li introduced the Top 100 Agents and Top 100 Industry Applications on the ERNIE AgentBuilder platform.\n\nBaidu World 2024 also highlighted the latest user growth for ERNIE Bot, ERNIE's expanding role in enterprise applications, and featured the debut of Xiaodu AI Glasses by Xiaodu Technology.\n\nNew iRAG Technologyto Mitigate Hallucinations in Image Generation\n\nHallucinations, a phenomenon in which AI generates false or misleading information, have remained one of the most intractable barriers to the widespread adoption of generative AI. In text generation, RAG technology has largely resolved the problem of hallucinations, greatly enhancing the accuracy of generated answers. However, in the field of multimodality, hallucinations remain a key obstacle, often manifesting as inaccurate depictions of people or landmarks.\n\nBaidu's newly launched iRAG technology can mitigate hallucinations in text-to-image generation. Leveraging Baidu Search's vast collection of hundreds of millions of images and the company's strong foundation model capabilities, the new technology enables text-to-image models to deliver hyper-realistic visuals while also significantly reducing the cost of image production. The ability of the iRAG to reduce hallucinations boosts the applicability of images generated by text-to-image models across visual mediums, including comics, storyboards, posters, among others. Li described the reduction of hallucinations as laying the groundwork for the coming boom in AI applications.\n\nMiaoda: Building Applications with Natural Language\n\nBaidu also unveiled Miaoda, a no-code tool that makes it possible to build entire applications simply by describing them in natural language. Miaoda provides no-code programming, multi-agent collaboration, and multi-tool invocation. No-code programming allows anyone to generate code without writing a single line, lowering barriers to AI development and making it accessible to all. Its multi-agent collaboration leverages ERNIE's thinking and planning capabilities to coordinate and manage different agents effectively, while its multi-tool invocation taps into ERNIE's tool invocation abilities, extensively utilizing web search, iRAG, maps API, and other tools for a seamless workflow.\n\n\"Baidu isn't aiming to launch a 'super app'; instead, we aim to help more people and businesses create millions of 'super useful' applications,\" Li said.\n\nMirroring the real-world product development process, Miaoda draws on the abilities of different agents across multiple domains such as project management and planning, content editing, programming and quality control. Miaoda can even automatically identify bugs and use a range of tools. Li called it \"the most complex application case of multi-agent collaboration to date\".\n\nMiaoda empowers everyone with the capabilities of a programmer \u2013 anyone who can speak, can create applications, greatly enhancing human productivity.\n\nAgents as the Next Frontier in AI Application\n\n\"Today, while all leading global tech firms are paying attention to agents, few have made them as central to their strategy as Baidu has,\" Li said at the event. He likened the potential of agents to websites in the PC era and social media accounts in the mobile age.\n\n\"Agents are more human-like, more intelligent, and act like your sales, customer service representatives, or assistants. Agents will become a new vehicle for content, information and services,\" Li added.\n\nFour types of agents \u2013 company, character, tool, and industry \u2013 were highlighted at the event to demonstrate the potential of agents in the AI era. Company agents, for example, differ from traditional websites that only show static company and product information, and can instead proactively recommend products based on customer needs and respond promptly to service requests, greatly improving the efficiency of interactive marketing. After deploying an agent powered by ERNIE, automaker BYD saw a 119% increase in lead conversion.\n\nLi also offered the example of the tool agent Free Canvas, developed in collaboration between Baidu Wenku and Baidu Drive. It allows users to drag and drop documents, audio, video, and other materials onto a canvas-like interface to quickly generate multimodal content. Similarly, the industry agent Faxingbao was specifically developed for the legal field. It has answered over 16.6 million legal questions and can also calculate compensation, draft legal documents, and recommend suitable lawyers.\n\nTo date, Baidu's ERNIE AgentBuilder has garnered the interest of 150,000 businesses and 800,000 developers.

        "article_content": "For the most part, Google has issued an update to the Pixel Watch roughly once a month. Most were simple security updates, while others included new features and OS upgrades. Fans expected an update in October, but Google delayed it until this month. This update will resume the rollout of Wear OS 5 to Pixel Watch 1 and Pixel Watch 2 users after a series of crashes caused Google to pause it back in September. After several months of work, the company has addressed the cause of the crashes and is confident that yesterday\u2019s update will be stable.\n\nIn addition to Wear OS 5, the update will also include better camera controls and changes to the Pixel Recorder app, which will be available through the Play Store. Your individual watch will notify you when the update is available for download, so you don\u2019t have to constantly check for it. The first update for the Pixel Watch 3 since its launch is also coming with bug fixes and security updates. All Pixel Watch models will eventually update to version AW2A.241105.012, although when the update happens will depend on both the carrier and the device.\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019re going to have to wait a while for the next Pixel Watch software updates, which Google says won\u2019t come until March 2025. Before now, Pixel Watch users have never before seen a three-month gap in updates. The longest time between updates usually coincided with operating system upgrades, such as from Wear OS 3 to Wear OS 4. That said, slower updates aren\u2019t necessarily a downside. By reducing the time spent on deploying bug fixes, Google could potentially focus on releasing regular, larger updates \u2014 maybe quarterly versus monthly.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile the wait is unfortunate, it does have a gleaming silver lining. The schedule for the next update lines up with a March Feature Drop. You can expect some significant upgrades and improvements, along with a few updates we already know are coming like the Android 15 QPR2 beta. Expect to see changes not only in how the Pixel Watch works, but also in how it interacts with Android. It\u2019s also safe to say that there are likely several surprises we haven\u2019t come across yet."
