Lab 9 Films has revealed an official trailer for yet another new documentary about UFOs \u2013 this one called The Program. Ever since the US government started actually talking openly about UFOs, now officially known as UAP (\"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena\") sightings, Ufologists have been going crazy. They've gone beyond conspiracy drifting into full-on \"it has to be true!\" irrefutable belief. Of course. The Program is yet another new UFOs / aliens-are-real film from filmmaker James Fox, who also made The Phenomenon and Moment of Contact in the years before. Featuring narration by Peter Coyote (Bitter Moon, E.T.). The doc includes \"extensive interviews with insiders, experts and politicians. Christopher Mellon, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, and Stanford University's Dr. Gary Nolan, [are] among those who appear in the doc.\" It's another doc about extraterrestrials that now wants to dig into the question: is there a big government program keeping the truth a secret? (Is it called The X-Files?) What do you believe?\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for James Fox's UFO doc The Program, direct from YouTube:\n\nThis highly anticipated follow-up to director James Fox's other blockbuster UFO documentary films, The Phenomenon (2020) and Moment of Contact (2022), The Program explores the unprecedented bipartisan Congressional effort to uncover what US intelligence agencies really know about UFOs, now referred to as UAP. The first two public hearings in over half a century included testimony under oath from military & intelligence officers with jaw-dropping allegations of a clandestine program to analyze materials and non-human biologics. Through candid interviews with high-ranking insiders, elected officials, physicists, intelligence officers, and military whistleblowers, The Program goes behind the scenes to leave even the staunchest skeptics astounded by the assertions from a growing chorus of insiders that we are not alone. The Program is directed by ufologist / filmmaker James Fox, director of the other doc films I Know What I Saw, The Phenomenon, and Moment of Contact previously. Produced by James Fox & Lance Mungia. Lab 9 Films releases Fox's doc The Program in select US theaters + on VOD to watch later in 2024. Stay tuned."

On one popular benchmark test, LiquidAI said its largest and most capable model could equal the performance of Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1-70B model released in July while needing much less computer memory, since it is only about one-sixth the size.\n\nIn a blog post and white paper released on Monday, LiquidAI claimed that its software could generate answers as quickly as competitors while requiring less memory and computing power, thus saving money and consuming less energy.\n\nOne of Boston\u2019s most prominent artificial intelligence startups, LiquidAI , on Monday disclosed how its software works for the first time \u2014 and how it might be able to outperform popular AI apps like ChatGPT. The company is also making the software accessible to anyone over the internet for further testing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve markedly improved quality, cost-effectiveness, and power efficiency compared to current GPT models,\u201d LiquidAI chief executive and cofounder Ramin Hasani said in the blog post. \u201cOur innovative architecture allows us to outperform larger traditional models, providing powerful solutions that are both cost-effective and scalable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiquidAI was founded in March 2023 by Hasani, chief technical officer Mathias Lechner, and chief scientific officer Alexander Amini, with MIT professor Daniela Rus, who runs the university\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\n\nHasani and Lechner studied the brain of a tiny roundworm as inspiration for creating a new kind of computer neural network. Instead of modeling the network on the human brain, which has about 86 billion neurons, they used the roundworm\u2019s brain, which has just 300 neurons.\n\nEssentially, the digital \u201cneurons\u201d in LiquidAI\u2019s model operate in a more flexible way than the \u201cneurons\u201d in large language models. The model can generate text or video or be used for other AI tasks, the company said.\n\nIn the blog post, LiquidAI said it had developed models of varying size and capability, with some able to run on smartphones and others requiring larger servers in a data center. The models were tested against a handful of comparable rivals using a variety of industry benchmarks, where they met or exceeded the performance of competing large language models, the company said. Those claims were not independently verified by the Globe. (LiquidAI did not test its models against OpenAI\u2019s GPT models, which are vastly larger and required hundreds of millions of dollars or more to create.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting on Monday, people can access the models through LiquidAI\u2019s chatbot or try linking their own software via the company\u2019s website and some other cloud services. The company also said customers would be able to run its software on a variety of hardware, including chips from Apple, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Qualcomm.\n\nSo far, LiquidAI has shown success using its software in a few ways but will need to prove it can attack a variety of large-scale challenges, particularly around generating text and more complicated math or coding problems, Usama Fayyad, executive director of the Institute for Experiential Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern, said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done the early breakthrough work and it\u2019s a promising direction,\u201d said Fayyad, who worked on AI and data science in Silicon Valley for decades before joining the university. \u201cNow the question is ... can they show it applying to many tasks, reliably under many conditions.\u201d\n\nLast December, LiquidAI raised $37.5 million in seed funding from high-profile investors led by Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca and San Francisco venture capital firm OSS Capital. The company is rumored to be raising considerably more for its next funding round.\n\nThe company is planning a public demonstration of its software on Oct. 23 at MIT\u2019s Kresge Auditorium.\n\nAaron Pressman can be reached at aaron.pressman@globe.com.

        "article_content": "Scientists turn to innovative app to help solve 'huge problem' plaguing bee populations: 'Better tools ... are really important'\n\nA new app that uses AI to identify bees is set to help researchers across the U.S. to track bee populations, the first step in helping species under threat, KCUR Kansas City News reports.\n\nUntil now, researchers interested in bee populations have had a difficult time differentiating among the estimated 4,000 North American bee species.\n\n\"It's a huge problem,\" said Kansas State University entomologist Brian Spiesman, who created the app, per KCUR. \"We bring back a few hundred specimens [from fieldwork] and we spend much longer identifying them in the lab than we do actually collecting them.\"\n\nIn fact, some of the trickiest specimens may not be identifiable to most researchers. The smallest ones are gnat-sized, with subtle differences between species, KCUR revealed. So instead, they're mailed to specialists who sort out the fine differences.\n\nThis takes up researchers' time and slows down their projects, not to mention that there are never enough of those top experts.\n\nThat's why Spiesman decided to train an AI to do the work.\n\nBeeMachine is a smartphone app available not only to researchers, but to members of the general public. Snap a photo of a bee, and the computer will identify the species or at least the genus. So far, it's been trained on 350 bee varieties, with more to come. Spiesman hopes to train the AI on all 20,000 species of bee worldwide and to get international users involved.\n\nTracking where bees appear is essential to identifying and protecting potentially endangered species.\n\nFor example, right now, the Southern Plains bumblebee and the American bumblebee are both under review by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and could be listed as threatened or endangered, which would come with legal protections. There are thousands of other species facing the same threat of habitat destruction, rising temperatures, and insecticide use that might benefit from endangered species status.\n\nIt's worth going out of our way to help bees because they're prolific pollinators, carrying pollen from one plant to another. According to Pollinator.org, as many as 95% of the world's flowering plants may rely on pollinators to reproduce and bear fruit \u2014 and that includes many of the plants we rely on for food. A decline in the populations of bees and other pollinators could dramatically impact human life if it's not addressed.\n\nBut BeeMachine could help turn the situation around.\n\n\"This type of citizen science has the potential to get more eyes out there sighting bees than any single study could ever hope for,\" Spiesman said, per KCUR. \"Better tools for crowdsourcing are really important.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

        "source": "TechCrunch",
        "article_content": "Apps catering to the Chinese diaspora, especially urban consumers focused on food, can be big business. Now, HungryPanda, one of the trailblazing startups in that market, is announcing more funding to double down on the opportunity.\n\nThe food-delivery app, founded in London and aimed at Chinese and other Asian consumers living outside their home countries, has picked up $55 million. The company will use the capital to continue building its existing business and expanding into new categories like groceries, it said, as well as to make more acquisitions and update its tech, specifically with a focus on more AI and machine learning to optimize operations.\n\nHungryPanda is not disclosing its valuation, but we understand from sources that it is now in the region of $500 million post-money. For context, the last valuation PitchBook lists is from 2020 and is just over $289 million. The startup has raised $275 million to date.\n\nThe startup, founded in 2017, claims to be the largest of the Asian overseas food delivery platforms, competing against the likes of Fantuan (based out of Vancouver) and GrubMarket-owned FreshGoGo (based out of New York). Just as both of these rivals have grown by acquisition, so too has HungryPanda, picking up EASI in Australia and BUY@HOME in New Zealand.\n\nOperating as a classic, three-sided, on-demand food marketplace \u00e0 la DoorDash or Instacart, HungryPanda said it has 6.5 million customers, 100,000 merchants and 80,000 riders across 80 cities in 10 countries. The company\u2019s footprint has grown over the years. When it last raised funding ($130 million in 2021), it said it was live in 60 cities; in 2020, when it raised $90 million, it said it operated in 47 cities. (The first time it disclosed customer numbers seems to be earlier this year, when it said it had 6 million, so that number has grown, too.)\n\nHungryPanda said it\u2019s aiming for $1 billion in gross transaction volume for this year, and it is already profitable.\n\n\u201cReaching profitability while maintaining significant growth demonstrates the strength of our business model and our long-term vision,\u201d said Eric Liu, HungryPanda\u2019s founder and CEO, in a statement.\n\nThe company is describing the capital as a \u201crefinancing and fundraise,\u201d implying that some of this is primary and some possibly secondary and/or debt. It declined to comment on the structure of the financing. We have reached out to investors to clarify and will update if we learn more. Mars Growth Capital (a JV between Liquidity Group and MUFG) is leading the round, with previous backers Perwyn, Kinnevik, 83North and Felix also participating.\n\nEric Liu started HungryPanda after wanting such a service himself. As a student at the University of Nottingham, he discovered that while there were Chinese restaurants in the city, Chinese students like himself found it nearly impossible to order from them. Menus were in English and the translations were nearly meaningless, and sometimes the food had been criminally adjusted to meet British palates.\n\nAs Liu has told us previously, this was a bigger problem than it might be for some other groups of expats: Chinese people prefer to eat \u201ctraditional\u201d food, he said, and they take the business of eating very seriously.\n\nHungryPanda was his solution: An app, in Chinese, that provided all the information to students like him in a format that they could actually use. It would include items that typically might only be offered on side menus to Chinese customers in Mandarin, if at all, if they were eating at the restaurant itself.\n\nHungryPanda\u2019s initial focus on the younger demographic, specifically students, helped it bypass some of the trickier unit economics of food-delivery platforms. While apps like Deliveroo were built around the idea of making two deliveries per hour, per driver to make every hour profitable, HungryPanda was used by people ordering \u201cfamily-style,\u201d where orders are doubled or even tripled \u2014 making individual deliveries more profitable. It\u2019s notable that other apps catering to a wider pool of users have adopted some of those mechanics over the years.\n\nThat has evolved since HungryPanda now targets a wider group of customers beyond students living in dorms, but Liu believes it\u2019s still nailed matching what it offers to what its users want, which it plans to apply now also to groceries.\n\n\u201cThanks to our combined Eastern and Western cultural background, we not only comprehend the operational challenges that Asian food merchants face abroad, but we also have a thorough grasp of the needs of Chinese and Asian expats living overseas,\u201d Liu said in an emailed interview. \u201cThis allows us to effectively and accurately meet the demands of both sides, ensuring a seamless connection between supply and demand.\u201d\n\nWhile geopolitical tensions may tell one story about how China interfaces with the western world, the actual movement of people tells another story about how societies and cultures are mixing. The Chinese diaspora of first-generation consumers alone is estimated now to be at over 50 million people globally \u2014 and that is before you count further generations of immigrants (such as the children of first-generation immigrants born abroad), as well as people from Asian countries beyond China.\n\nOriginally the app was only available in Mandarin \u2014 it really did focus on one specific market \u2014 but in more recent years, and especially as HungryPanda has expanded to more countries, it\u2019s incorporated local languages into the mix.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because the app has scaled to providing services to a wider group of Asian customers, which might also include second- or third-generation people who don\u2019t speak native languages as well, but also because HungryPanda has found wider popularity with foodies who are not Asian but simply like to seek out authentic food experiences.\n\n\u201cHungryPanda is more than just a delivery platform \u2014 we see ourselves as an ambassador of Asian cuisine,\u201d Liu said.\n\nThe app is available in English, Chinese, French, Japanese, and Korean, Liu told TechCrunch.\n\nThe formula is popular enough that a number of other apps targeting Asian consumers abroad have sprouted up and those too have found traction around food experiences. Swarms of consumers, chattering about authentic Asian food, have even created whole destinations out of some towns. Dusseldorf, for example, saw a surge of young Chinese visitors after Chinese users in the city started posting about the food available there on social media app Xiaohongshu.\n\nUpdated with more details on valuation and comments from the CEO."

This trend could lead to increased competition and potentially faster advancements in AI technology.\n\nGoogle\u2019s NotebookLM interface allows users to create AI-powered research notebooks by uploading documents and converting complex material into easily digestible formats. (Image: Google)\n\nThe double-edged sword: Opportunities and risks in open-source AI\n\nThe proliferation of easily created AI tools also presents challenges. As more developers gain the ability to create powerful AI applications, concerns about data privacy, security, and the ethical use of AI become more pressing. The open-source nature of tools like Open NotebookLM allows for community scrutiny and improvement, but it also means that malicious actors could potentially adapt the technology for harmful purposes.\n\nFor enterprise users and decision-makers, the rise of open-source AI tools like Open NotebookLM presents both opportunities and risks. On one hand, these tools offer cost-effective alternatives to proprietary solutions and the flexibility to customize applications to specific needs. On the other hand, they may lack the support, security guarantees, and ongoing development that come with commercial products.\n\nAs the lines between proprietary and open-source AI continue to blur, we may be entering a new phase in software development. The power to create sophisticated AI applications is spreading beyond large tech companies, potentially fostering a more diverse AI ecosystem. However, this shift also underscores the need for robust frameworks to ensure the responsible development and use of AI technologies.\n\nChua and the open-source community are capitalizing on their ability to rapidly replicate and iterate on proprietary AI technologies. As this trend continues, it may prompt tech giants to reconsider their approach to AI development, potentially leading to more collaboration between proprietary and open-source efforts in the future."

        "article_content": "Source: GrumpyBeere/Pixabay\n\nBelief in the paranormal continues to enjoy a central place in popular culture. Social scientists classify something as \"paranormal\" when it runs counter to both a scientific understanding of the world and mainstream religious doctrine (Bader et al., 2010). It can include a wide range of entities, events, or abilities like psychic abilities, fairies, or the alleged influence of the stars on human affairs.\n\nPolls frequently find that belief in paranormal phenomena is not at all unusual. For example, one poll found that 36 percent of Americans reported that they believe in ghosts while over a fifth believed in witchcraft or magic spells (Ipsos, 2021).\n\nThis widespread belief is all the more interesting considering there is no hard evidence to support the existence of anything paranormal (see Markovsky, 2023 for a review). Instead, research finds that anomalous claims are usually based on very non-paranormal things like subjective feelings, quirky experiences, technical glitches in recording devices, or misperceptions (Radford, 2010). So why do some people interpret this sort of phenomenon as paranormal while others do not?\n\nPerception and Categorization\n\nMany researchers have been interested in precisely this question. One possible explanation has to do with how different people tend to perceive and categorize things.\n\nFrom a very early age, children acquire \"core knowledge\" about the world around them (Wellman and Gelman, 1998). Through experience, they learn that there are different classes or categories of things that have different properties and how to distinguish between them.\n\nFor instance, there are physical things that are different from mental things and inanimate things that are different from animate. A thought or feeling does not have shape or size, but physical objects do. Similarly, inanimate things don\u2019t move of their own volition and don\u2019t make decisions, but animate ones do.\n\nSince this is a fundamental aspect of developmental psychology, it has been proposed that there could be a link between one\u2019s mastery of core knowledge and their tendency to believe in things\u2014like the paranormal\u2014that run counter to the understanding of the world that this formative knowledge should provide. In particular, the extent to which a given person is prone to \"ontological confusion\" could explain many such beliefs (Lindeman and Aarnio, 2007).\n\nIn other words, their tendency to mistake one category of thing or its properties for another type. This results in a lack of conceptual clarity where, for example, they might tend to mistakenly attribute living characteristics to inanimate objects or assign physical properties to mental things.\n\nThis misperception fits well with many of the experiences paranormal believers interpret as supernatural. For example, many accounts of encounters with seemingly otherworldly forces mistake internal feelings as something caused by an external force (Debies-Carl, 2023). A walk in a cemetery at night can be understandably scary, but to mistake that fear as something psychically caused by an entity lurking in that environment is something else entirely. Seeing some sort of agency in bad luck or perceiving consciousness in \"cursed\" objects conceivably also represent examples of ontological confusion.\n\nSource: magwood_photography/Pixabay\n\nSeveral studies over the years have attempted to examine this question. Generally, they find support for the connection between ontological confusion and paranormal beliefs (e.g. Betsch et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2024). However, the results also tend to vary from one study to the next.\n\nFortunately, a new paper published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences provides new insight into this topic (Gallyamova et al., 2024). Rather than simply collecting new data from a new sample of participants to examine the question, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of existing research on the subject. This is a formalized method of inquiry that statistically combines the results of previous research on a specific research question. In doing so, it can locate any deeper patterns that exist between all of this body of work despite the differences between them.\n\nThe synthesis included a total of 25 previous studies, published between 2010 and 2024, that examined the relationship between ontological confusion and belief in the paranormal. In total, these studies included data on 16,129 participants from 11 different countries. This provides a reasonable sample to work with, not only in terms of the total number of people involved, but also due to its cross-cultural representativeness.\n\nThe authors employed statistical methods to check for publication bias that could affect their results\u2014an important concern with any meta-analysis\u2014but they found no evidence of significant bias. This increases confidence in the findings.\n\nWhat the Latest Study Found\n\nThe results indicated that there was considerable diversity in these studies. Specific results varied across them, which can make finding a clear pattern difficult. However, the overall outcome was a consistent pattern: People who express more ontological confusion are more likely to also express belief in the paranormal.\n\nThe fact that the study included a range of nations helps to determine whether any findings were caused by cultural differences or something more fundamental about the human psyche. In this case, despite differences across studies in different countries, the overall pattern persisted.\n\nThis report\u2019s findings are interesting in and of themselves, but they also highlight potential directions for future research. The first has to do with the fact that there was variation in the strength of the relationship between ontological confusion and paranormal belief that could not be accounted for by looking at the variables the authors had access to. From this, it is clear that there are other important factors that play a role but that still need to be identified.\n\nSecond, the results also highlight the need for further cross-cultural research. This is especially true for work that can carefully ensure the validity of measures across different nations and languages.\n\nWhile questions remain, the findings illustrate a fascinating link between cognition and the things we are willing to believe. They also seem to indicate that culture or some other social factors could modify this relationship, given the variance in the study. Consequently, further inquiry could lead to new insights into how to improve our critical thinking and, in the process, protect ourselves against beliefs formed on shaky foundations."

        "article_content": "Minneapolis is home to countless reports of ghosts, ghouls, spirits, specters, phantoms and paranormal activity.\n\nFrom the scornful spirits skulking around a historic skyscraper to the clueless ghost of a clumsy barmaid, a plethora of supposed spirits have been reported in the community. Skeptics and believers alike have come up with inconclusive evidence of these hauntings, leaving the truth behind these ghastly stories a mystery.\n\nOne of the most famous haunted places in the mill city is Foshay Tower, said to be haunted by Ponzi scheme pioneer Wilbur Foshay. Legend has it that Foshay jumped off of his namesake tower. In reality, Foshay died of a stroke in a nearby nursing home in 1957.\n\n\u201cDangerous\u201d Linda Lee, local ghost tour guide and regional vice president of American Ghost Walks, said she believes she knows whose spirit is actually haunting the historic building downtown. Lee said the Foshay Tower is haunted by the ghosts of Mrs. Genevieve Clark and her family.\n\nThe sole woman juror on Foshay\u2019s fraud trial, Clark was also the sole holdout on the jury, ultimately leading to a mistrial. It was later discovered that Clark and her husband had financial dealings with Foshay, and she was charged with contempt of court for not disclosing her relationship with him during the trial.\n\nClark, her husband and two sons died of carbon monoxide poisoning in an apparent suicide in 1933. Lee said she believes Clark may be haunting the Foshay Tower because of the unresolved emotional conflict between her and the utility magnate.\n\nLee said she has been preparing and guiding ghost tours in Minnesota for almost ten years, occasionally assisted by a spirit named Alice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s storytelling, it\u2019s history, it\u2019s spirituality,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThis was made for me.\u201d\n\nA few blocks away from the downtown stops of Lee\u2019s ghost tour is the historic Black Forest Inn in Uptown, where many claim to have seen or felt the presence of strange supernatural spirits.\n\nGina Christ, co-owner of the family-owned haunt, said she began to believe the ghost stories because so many of the restaurant\u2019s employees reported paranormal activity in the building, especially in the basement.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s haunted because of the consensus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a level of universality that I find really compelling.\u201d\n\nReports of hauntings eventually led Christ to invite the Twin Cities Paranormal Society to investigate the Inn\u2019s supposed haunting. The Twin Cities Paranormal Society claimed to have recorded a disembodied voice saying \u201cHelp me\u201d during an overnight investigation of the restaurant, according to member Thomas Troupe.\n\nTroupe said investigators contacted the spirit of a former maintenance worker named Dale at a workbench in the basement of the restaurant. Using an array of recording devices and an electromagnetic frequency measuring device, he said investigators were able to ask the spirit questions about their life and afterlife.\n\n\u201cThe conversation was pretty one-sided,\u201d Troupe said.\n\nIn 2013, the Twin Cities Paranormal Society investigated another of Minneapolis\u2019 haunted landmarks, the nearby Turnblad Mansion, home to the American Swedish Institute. Reports of hauntings at the mansion date all the way back to 1921, said Andrea Justus, volunteer and interpretive services coordinator of the Institute.\n\nJustus leads flashlight tours of the mansion in the days before Halloween, giving guests a history lesson about both the mansion and the reported hauntings. However, Justus said she is still unsure whether she believes in ghosts.\n\n\u201cI leave it up to people to come to their own conclusions,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no super conclusive evidence.\u201d\n\nDespite his belief in the existence of ghosts, Troupe said he understands doubts about the validity of evidence produced in paranormal investigations.\n\nLee said she also understands the skepticism because most people who have not experienced anything paranormal have difficulty understanding the supernatural.\n\n\u201cDo we have definitive, absolute proof? No,\u201d Troupe said. \u201cBut we have weird things we can\u2019t explain.\u201d\n\nPeter Harle, a University of Minnesota professor and folklore enthusiast, said believing in ghosts can be both comforting and exciting. Ghost stories are a way for people to understand something operating differently from reality, he said.\n\nHarle said ghost stories take us out of our own existence. Investigating suspected supernatural synchronicities is a way for people to put themselves in the story, he added.\n\n\u201cWe relate to our ghosts in curious ways,\u201d Harle said."

The introduction of the IBM Quantum System 2 marks a significant milestone in the field, bringing us closer to realizing the full potential of quantum computing. Central to this technology are quantum bits, or qubits, which are the building blocks of quantum computers. Unlike classical bits, which can only exist in a state of either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a state of superposition, meaning they can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This remarkable property allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of data at unprecedented speeds, tackling complex problems that would take classical computers centuries to solve.\n\nCore Principles of Quantum Computing\n\nThe fundamental difference between classical bits and qubits lies in their quantum mechanical nature. While classical computers use bits to perform calculations sequentially, quantum computers use the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to solve complex problems in a fraction of the time. Entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more qubits become correlated in such a way that their states are dependent on each other, regardless of the distance between them. This alignment with the quantum mechanical nature of the universe enables quantum computers to tackle problems that are currently unsolvable by classical means, opening up new frontiers in scientific discovery and technological advancement.\n\nQuantum computers use superposition and entanglement to solve complex problems\n\nQubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, unlike classical bits\n\nQuantum computing aligns with the quantum mechanical nature of the universe\n\nQuantum Computing Explained\n\nHere are a selection of other articles from our extensive library of content you may find of interest on the subject of Quantum computing :\n\nTransformative Applications\n\nQuantum computing holds the potential to transform various fields, from material science and drug discovery to cryptography and artificial intelligence. In the field of material science, quantum computers can simulate the behavior of complex molecules and materials at an unprecedented level of accuracy, leading to the discovery of new materials with unique properties that could have far-reaching implications for industries such as energy, electronics, and aerospace. In the realm of medicine, quantum simulations can accelerate the process of drug discovery by accurately modeling the interactions between molecules and proteins, allowing the development of targeted therapies for diseases that have long eluded conventional treatments.

        "article_content": "The closest single star to Earth is home to at least one planet, and it\u2019s a rocky little world not so different from ours.\n\nAstronomers spotted a small, rocky planet orbiting the red dwarf known as Barnard\u2019s Star, which is about 6 light years away from Earth. While the Centauri system are our closest neighbors in space, Barnard\u2019s Star is the nearest system that\u2019s a single star instead of a complicated trio. Until now, astronomers weren\u2019t sure whether it had any planets, but recent data from the Very Large Telescope (yes, that\u2019s its real name) shows that there\u2019s at least one small, rocky world zipping around the nearby star. The recent data also offers hints that there may be more planets around Barnard\u2019s star, and at least one may be in the habitable zone.\n\nInstituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias astrophysicist Jonay Gonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez and his colleagues published their work in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nThis artist\u2019s illustration shows what Barnard b might look like as it zips around Barnard\u2019s Star once every 3 days. It\u2019s too close and too hot to support life, but it could be a hint that there are more rocky, more-or-less Earth-like worlds waiting to be found in the nearby system. ESO\n\nNew Exoplanet Just Dropped, and It\u2019s HOT\n\nHern\u00e1ndez and his colleagues spent the last five years watching Barnard\u2019s Star through one of the VLT\u2019s instruments, called Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO), which measures how the wavelength of a star\u2019s light subtly changes when the star \u201cwobbles\u201d under the slight gravitational tug of a planet. Measuring the star\u2019s wobble can reveal the planet\u2019s mass and how long it takes to complete an orbit. This is why Hern\u00e1ndez and his colleagues can say that Barnard b, their newly-discovered world, is at least half as massive as Venus and orbits its star once every 3 (Earth) days.\n\nThat also means Barnard b is probably too hot to be livable, even for the hardiest thermophiles. To zip around Barnard\u2019s Star once every three days, the planet would have to be just 5 percent of the distance between Mercury and the Sun. Barnard\u2019s Star is much dimmer and cooler than our Sun, but that\u2019s still scorchingly close. Hern\u00e1ndez and his colleagues estimate that the planet\u2019s average surface temperature is about 257 degrees Fahrenheit, just a little too hot for liquid water to exist on its surface.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nHern\u00e1ndez and his colleagues haven\u2019t yet found the planet they were actually looking for: a rocky, Earth-sized world in the star\u2019s habitable zone, or the distance from the star where temperatures on a planet\u2019s surface should be exactly right for liquid water. But they did find a rocky planet around our nearest single neighbor, and that\u2019s an encouraging sign that there might be more. The ESPRESSO data, in fact, hints that three more planets might also be tugging on Barnard\u2019s Star every few days, from greater distances than Barnard b.\n\nThe team is still observing Barnard\u2019s Star with ESPRESSO, trying to get enough data to say for sure whether those three planets exist. They\u2019ll also need to confirm what they\u2019ve found with other telescopes at other observatories \u2014 the same process they went through to confirm that Barnard b was real and not just a glitch in the data.\n\nBack in 2018, another team of astronomers thought they might have found a super-Earth \u2014 a planet several times larger than Earth but not quite as massive as Neptune \u2014 orbiting Barnard\u2019s Star, but data from other telescopes didn\u2019t confirm its presence. Hern\u00e1ndez and his colleagues\u2019 recent data also didn\u2019t support the 2018 world, which means it probably doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nBut Hern\u00e1ndez and his colleagues say Barnard\u2019s Star b is an encouraging discovery.\n\n\u201cThe discovery of this planet, along with other previous discoveries such as Proxima b and d, shows that our cosmic backyard is full of low-mass planets,\u201d Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias astrophysicist Alejandro Su\u00e1rez Mascare\u00f1o says in a recent statement."

        "article_content": "Humanity's best piece of technology when it comes to exploring the universe, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), has made a brand new discovery that scientists have been forced to label as 'weird'.\n\nThe bizarre discovery has seen American space agency NASA describe it as 'something unprecedented'.\n\nSince late 2021, the $10 billion (\u00a37.5 billion) satellite has been exploring the universe, sending back images of deep space to Earth.\n\nSome of things it has found have been absolutely remarkable, with scientists labelling certain discoveries as 'jaw-dropping'.\n\nAdvert\n\nOperated by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, it is the heir to the Hubble Space Telescope that was first launched in to space back in 1990.\n\nAnd after making discoveries from close to the beginning of time that feels like the stuff of science fiction, the discoveries keep on coming as Webb keeps on searching.\n\nThe latest discovery by JWST concerns a galaxy known as GS-NDG-9422 (9422), with the image in question coming from just one billion years after the Big Bang itself.\n\nA faint dot? Nope - a clue to how the universe may have formed galaxies as we know them (NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Alex Cameron (Oxford))\n\nAdvert\n\nThe galaxy is full of huge stars burning twice as hot than anything close to our own galaxy.\n\nAnd now, NASA says the discovery from Webb 'may be a missing-link phase of galactic evolution' in showing us how our galaxies looked before their current status. Mega.\n\nConcerning the 'missing link', NASA explains that it could help us understand how we went from the universe\u2019s first stars to 'familiar, well-established galaxies'.\n\nLead researcher Alex Cameron, of the University of Oxford, said: \"My first thought in looking at the galaxy\u2019s spectrum was, \u2018that\u2019s weird,\u2019 which is exactly what the Webb telescope was designed to reveal: totally new phenomena in the early universe that will help us understand how the cosmic story began.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nWhat does it mean in normal speak? Well, the stars in galaxy 9422 are terrorising huge gas clouds surrounding them with humungous quantities of light, which in turn heats the clouds. This then heats these clouds up, outshining the very stars themselves.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope being constructed before launching in to the cosmos (NASA/Desiree Stover)\n\nThis is big, and could be a indicator at to what comes after the stars shine bright, as scientists cannot be sure what comes after stars began coming together to form galaxies as we know them.\n\nCameron's colleague at Oxford, Dr Harley Katz, added: \"It looks like these stars must be much hotter and more massive than what we see in the local universe, which makes sense because the early universe was a very different environment.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nCameron reached out to Dr Katz to discuss the 'strange' data.\n\nWorking together, their team found that computer models of cosmic gas clouds heated by very hot, massive stars, to an extent that the gas shone brighter than the stars, was nearly a perfect match to Webb\u2019s observations.\n\nCGI of the James Webb Space Telescope in space (Getty Stock Image)\n\nIn the universe close to what we call home, your typical hot, massive stars have a temperature ranging between 70,000 to 90,000 degrees Fahrenheit (40,000 to 50,000 degrees Celsius).\n\nAdvert\n\nAccording to the team, galaxy 9422 has stars hotter than 140,000 degrees Fahrenheit (80,000 degrees Celsius).\n\nDr Kats said: \"The universe's stars are different than what we are familiar with - the exotic stars in this galaxy could be a guide for understanding how galaxies transitioned from primordial stars to the types of galaxies we already know.\""

        "article_content": "Texas Science & Natural History Museum, located on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin, saw record attendance in its first full year since rebranding and reopening in September 2023. Formerly known as Texas Memorial Museum, the 85-year-old museum reopened to the public late last September as a vibrant hub for education, exploration and discovery. In the last year, the space welcomed more than 75,000 visitors, hailing from all 50 states and 28 different countries. Nearly 300 school and community groups have toured the museum, and another 9,000 people, beyond the visiting museum-goers, came through the doors for private events, including wedding ceremonies and holiday parties.\n\n\u201cThere has been such an overwhelming and enthusiastic response from visitors in the last year, from Austin locals and from around the world,\u201d said Carolyn Connerat, managing director. \u201cThis museum is a treasure for our community, and it\u2019s a privilege to welcome curious minds of all ages through the doors.\u201d\n\nWith new investments from the University, the College of Natural Sciences and the Texas Legislature, in 2022 and 2023 the museum underwent significant renovations and rebranding to better reflect its mission and offerings. This transformation introduced new exhibits and modernized facilities designed to enhance the visitor experience and educational impact.\n\nThe museum\u2019s updated exhibits continue to showcase the rich geological, paleontological and natural history of Texas, while new displays connect visitors to the natural world, from prehistoric life to the impacts of current research and technology.\n\nIts newest temporary exhibit features a scale model of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, the largest optical telescope in North America. Located at the McDonald Observatory in West Texas, the 80-ton telescope boasts a 10-meter mirror composed of 91 hexagonal segments, making it a powerhouse for astronomical research. Visitors to the exhibit, \u201cBig Eye on Dark Skies: The Hobby-Eberly Telescope,\u201d will learn how this remarkable piece of technology is used to search for planets outside our solar system, look at distant galaxies and even study dark energy. Information about how to participate in a related citizen science project is also part of the exhibit, which is housed on the museum\u2019s third floor.\n\nThe telescope exhibit follows April\u2019s opening of the \u201cParticles of Color\u201d exhibit, which explores the science of sustainable fashion. Located in the museum\u2019s Science Frontiers Gallery, the exhibit focuses on the creation and use of plant-based biodegradable sequins, highlighting garments and accessories designed and made by UT students and faculty, as well as fashion industry professionals.\n\nNext March, the museum plans to open its reimagined hands-on Discovery Center, where visitors can explore real fossil specimens and engage in scientific thinking in an active educational space. Construction has begun on the project.\n\n\u201cThis historic museum\u2019s first year back was a phenomenal success, thanks to the many staff, volunteers, supporters and lawmakers who played a role,\u201d said David Vanden Bout, dean of the College of Natural Sciences. \u201cAlong with leaders across campus, I am excited to join these museum champions in making sure that future exciting offerings reach the broadest possible swath of the science-inspired community.\u201d\n\nThe museum recently received a grant from the Still Water Foundation to conduct engineering and architectural planning studies to redesign its Dinosaur Trackways Building, a 1940 Work Projects Administration (WPA) building that houses 113-million-year-old dinosaur footprints, discovered in Texas. The grant will also support a new conservation study on how to preserve the actual dinosaur tracks.\n\nThe museum frequently hosts educational programs for the public, such as an upcoming fossil identification event on National Fossil Day, Oct. 16. As part of its anniversary celebrations, the museum will host an outdoor screening of \u201cJurassic Park\u201d at 7:30 p.m. on Oct. 5. This is a ticketed event."

Unsurprisingly, local regulators have looked to Oregon for guidance as they develop their own rules and regulations.\n\nThere are already lessons to be learned.

But when the time came to renew her center\u2019s license, which costs $10,000 annually, Lafferty launched a crowdfunding campaign to cover the expense.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the program in Oregon is not set up in a way to where it is profitable. So we do not have the $10,000,\u201d Lafferty said in a Facebook video promoting her campaign.\n\nBut the community stepped up, and within two days, eight people had donated enough money to help Inner Guidance Services reach its goal. While that provided a stopgap, Lafferty doesn\u2019t know how she\u2019ll cover next year\u2019s fee.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at what you have to pay for the facilitators, for the space, rent, electricity \u2014 all of the things that you have to have \u2014 what have you to pay sums up to more than what you make reasonably,\u201d she said.\n\nLicensing fees are a hot topic in Colorado, as regulators barrel toward finalizing what it will cost for entrepreneurs to participate in this new industry. It\u2019s one of the last pieces to get settled after they spent a year-plus determining occupational requirements for facilitators and rules governing the business ecosystem surrounding psychedelic therapy.\n\nChallenges like the ones Lafferty described were common in the early days of marijuana legalization, said Rachel Gillette, a Denver-based attorney and head of the cannabis and psychedelics group at the Holland & Hart law firm. Even today, banks, landlords and insurance companies often upcharge businesses that work with federally controlled substances because they\u2019re considered more risky, she said.\n\nAdditionally, these businesses are subject to a federal tax code that prohibits them from deducting operating expenses from taxable income, driving up costs.\n\n\u201cEverything seems to come with a little bit of premium on it because it\u2019s something that\u2019s federally illegal,\u201d Gillette said. \u201cUntil (psilocybin) loses its stigma, until it\u2019s federally legal in some respect, I think that continues, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nCompliance costs don\u2019t stop with initial licensure, she added. These young industries continually evolve and businesses need to adapt to new regulations. Gillette expects there will be a smaller customer base for psychedelic-assisted therapy because it\u2019s so new and because, unlike cannabis, Colorado won\u2019t permit retail mushroom dispensaries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time to build the business so that people understand what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see somebody opening their doors for a natural medicine center and having lines out the door like they did on the first day of recreational cannabis. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nPricy for patients\n\nThe solution to sustainability is not as simple as passing costs onto the customer, Lafferty said. Psilocybin services are already notoriously pricy in Oregon, where a single guided trip can cost thousands of dollars for the drugs and for a facilitator who supervises each client while they\u2019re under the influence for several hours. Although psychedelic-assisted therapy is considered a mental health treatment by those in the industry, it\u2019s not yet covered by insurance.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing we learned is that the way the Oregon model is set up, it\u2019s a little bit over the price range for our target market, which we knew, but it\u2019s been confirmed,\u201d Lafferty said.\n\nIn its first year, Inner Guidance Services provided the equivalent of $33,000 in free services to individuals who could not afford to pay, Lafferty said. Since opening, she expanded the center\u2019s offerings to include microdosing counseling and introductory low doses for people who are new to psilocybin or hesitant to commit to a large dose. People can also register for group sessions, which are cheaper because the cost is split among several participants.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to not close, so we are trying a little bit of everything,\u201d Lafferty said.\n\nJenna Kluwe, co-owner of the now-shuttered The Journey Service Center in Portland, said the public needs more education so they can see the value of their investment not just for the trip, but also the sessions before and after. Those sessions, called preparation and integration, are integral to long-lasting change, she said. Kluwe\u2019s clients have described a guided psilocybin trip as several years of talk therapy \u2014 and therapy on its own isn\u2019t always cheap.\n\n\u201cThe value of this needs to be emphasized more and more for folks. Not just the sticker shock, but the value,\u201d said Kluwe.\n\nThe Journey Service Center closed in March after its investor halted funding, she said. Kluwe now works at another center called Fractal Soul running its equity program.\n\nLowering barriers to entry\n\nOne difference between the programs in Colorado and Oregon is that the laws here allow healthcare providers to integrate psilocybin therapy into their existing practices. (In Oregon, the businesses, facilities and staff must be separate duplicating costs for current healthcare professionals like Lafferty, a social worker with a private practice.)\n\nRegulators created a micro-healing center license for those places that intend to host just a couple of psilocybin sessions per month versus specializing in that type of treatment. Advocates are adamant the micro-healing center license will lower the barriers to entry in Colorado and streamline access for individuals who already have a therapist or psychiatrist. During a rulemaking hearing on Sept. 16, however, they shared concerns that the currently proposed fees are too high.\n\nIn its draft rules, the Department of Revenue proposed micro-healing centers pay $3,000 for application and compliance fees in 2025, before ramping up to a cumulative $5,000 in 2026 and $12,000 by 2027. The phased increase in fees is intended to both incentivize early participation and eventually fund the agency\u2019s administrative work overseeing the industry, regulators said.\n\nShannon Hughes is a social worker who currently offers ketamine-assisted therapy at her practice, An Enduring Love, in Fort Collins. She sees psilocybin as another tool in the behavioral health toolkit and hopes to integrate it once it\u2019s legal. An Enduring Love gets calls weekly from people interested in trying it.\n\nThe most logical way to offer that option would be to obtain a micro-healing center license, Hughes said. But if she had to pay $12,000 per year to do so, \u201cit would not fiscally make sense for our small practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know anybody in the mental health community who that would be viable for,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo I was disappointed and discouraged because you have to be a large operation to afford $12,000-plus in fees.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that all license types, including those for cultivation and manufacturing, will be subject to increased fees by 2027. For example, the latest draft rules dictate a standard healing center \u2013 meaning one that intends to specialize in psychedelic-assisted therapy \u2013 would be required to pay $6,000 in application and compliance fees in 2025, $8,000 in 2026, and $16,000 by 2027.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a concern that this current structure and approach will be an inoperable program,\u201d Tasia Poinsatte, director of the Healing Advocacy Fund, said during the recent rulemaking hearing, citing challenges in Oregon. \u201cIf we set fees that high and discourage participation today, it\u2019s going to make it that much harder to get this off the ground in the first place.\u201d\n\nRegulators plan to discuss licensing fees again at a meeting on Oct. 21.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get health news sent straight to your inbox."

        "article_content": "Explore the top project management trends for small businesses. Learn how AI, resource management, and cybersecurity can improve project outcomes. Maskot/Getty Images\n\nWhether it's a new dance on TikTok or a technological breakthrough, trends are a core part of daily life, and the project management landscape is no different. Understanding current trends in project management can influence goals and inspire action \u2014 which could lead to bigger and better outcomes for your business.\n\nKnowing the latest project management trends can help you plan better, stay ahead of the competition, overcome common project management challenges, and develop your team efficiently. To that end, we've gathered eight project management trends for 2024 specifically tailored for small businesses.\n\n1. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nArtificial intelligence is the single most significant current trend in project management.\n\n\u201cAI can suggest how to break down tasks into more manageable chunks, and those results can be discussed with the project team,\u201d says Craig Guarraci, founder of Tech PM Career Path, LLC, a career coaching company. He adds that \u201cAI can be used to take meeting notes, determine action items, and to send the notes to attendees, thus freeing up the project manager's time.\u201d\n\nFrom using generative AI to speed up project planning to leveraging AI's automation capabilities to handle repetitive or menial tasks, businesses are relying more and more on the power of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning to improve project outcomes and reach broader business goals.\n\nThrough AI, businesses can also determine what projects they should undertake and learn what other organizations are doing to stay ahead.\n\n\u201cAI could be used by a project manager to brainstorm nearly anything about the project and learn about similar projects,\u201d says Guarraci\n\n2. Putting outcomes over inputs\n\nEspecially with growth projects, project managers and businesses are placing a stronger emphasis on the tangible outcomes of projects than the amount of work that goes in. By focusing on outcomes, projects align more with business goals, and project managers can more easily define success.\n\nA key way to focus on project outcomes is through change management \u2014 both handling changes throughout a project carefully and efficiently and being mindful of organizational changes a project can cause.\n\n\u201cIt's great to complete a project on time, on budget, and within scope, but it's even greater to address change throughout the project lifecycle to ensure [the] realization of benefits,\u201d says Nicole Pietrangelo, project management consultant. \u201cAfter all, that's the real reason why we're doing projects.\u201d\n\nProject managers and business owners can also pivot toward putting outcomes over inputs by:\n\nShifting success metrics to highlight deliverables instead of the time spent on a task or the number of tasks completed\n\nUsing agile methodologies to keep projects transparent and focused on goals\n\nWorking backward from desired long-term goals when planning projects rather than starting from short-term needs or capabilities\n\n3. Hybrid and remote workspaces\n\nRemote and hybrid work arrangements are a major trend in project management and employment, partially due to changes made during the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMany employees and employers have found ways to make remote or hybrid work a cost-saving benefit that also improves some workers' work-life balance and overall happiness. Additionally, Upwork's Future of Remote Work study found that one-third of hiring managers say productivity has increased with remote working.\n\nHowever, hybrid and remote workspaces create a specific challenge for project management: it\u2019s difficult to communicate and collaborate with your team when they\u2019re spread across the globe.\n\n\u201cSomething to be aware of, especially in remote work, is the importance and impact of emotional intelligence and understanding that different people communicate differently,\u201d says Bill Morris IV, Director of Project Management at Morris, a custom thermal solutions company. \u201cAs an example, this may mean picking up the phone and calling someone instead of sending a quick email, even if the latter may seem quicker and easier.\u201d\n\nProject management programs and software have responded to this challenge by making communication and collaboration within the program more efficient. Other tools and cloud-based project management software, such as Microsoft Teams, Google Drive, Dropbox, Asana, Monday, and Slack, make asynchronous work more attainable and seamless.\n\n4. Bigger reliance on data\n\nBusinesses are turning towards data to drive decision-making at all levels to achieve bigger goals. By using data, outcomes can be better predicted, anomalies can be defined, and failures can be used as tools to achieve greater success in the future.\n\nA key trend in project management is making data-driven decisions from the beginning stages of project planning.\n\n\u201cData-driven decision-making is very important,\u201d says Joe Bowab, CEO and founder of Lobster Anywhere. \u201cIt can help improve efficiency and can help make vital decisions regarding the progress of the project.\u201d\n\nSome of the ways project managers can utilize data more effectively in their projects include:\n\nBasing project success on data-driven metrics\n\nMonitoring data points throughout a project to ensure things are on track\n\nUsing historical data to inform decisions\n\n5. Increased focus on cybersecurity\n\nIncreasing cybersecurity measures may seem like just an IT project management trend, but cybersecurity attacks can affect every area of a business. Striking a balance between safety and efficiency is a challenging line to toe, but it\u2019s vital for companies to keep their employees and data safe from cyberattacks.\n\nSome ways businesses are improving their cybersecurity in project management include:\n\nEstablishing role-based permissions to data and programs\n\nHolding periodic cybersecurity training sessions\n\nHaving dedicated cybersecurity experts on staff to review projects and ensure there aren\u2019t any holes\n\n6. Prioritizing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices\n\nBusinesses are becoming ever more mindful of ways to minimize their impact on the environment and local communities. As businesses shift toward more sustainable practices, project managers must prioritize ESG practices throughout the project life cycle.\n\nAdditionally, business leaders may be relying on project managers to see through environmentally conscious initiatives, especially in areas like infrastructure and energy.\n\nSome ways to keep ESG at the heart of project management are:\n\nAnalyzing the environmental impact of project practices and sourcing greener options when possible\n\nFinding ways to make projects benefit local communities and society as a whole in addition to meeting strategic business goals\n\nCrafting ethical standards for projects and meeting local, state, and federal regulatory requirements\n\n7. Being mindful of resource scarcity\n\nWith the ever-changing and uncertain economic environment, it\u2019s imperative for companies of all sizes, especially small businesses, to look for ways to stay competitive while staying mindful of their resources. Project managers have to find ways to do more with less, which requires getting creative with project planning and resourcing.\n\nSome ways for businesses to hop on the trend of being mindful of resources include:\n\nAdopting agile methodologies to keep projects efficient\n\nLeveraging technology, like software and AI, to streamline tasks and automate some project aspects\n\nUtilize free project management software and freelance work to minimize project expenses (Try Monday, HubSpot, or ClickUp for free.)\n\nGet stakeholders involved to capitalize on their knowledge and outside perspective\n\n8. Increasing communication and transparency\n\nProject managers have always walked a tight line between transparency and security. On the one hand, keeping a project under tight wraps can prevent information leaks, and having strict silos may allow employees to focus better on their tasks.\n\nHowever, building a more transparent project environment where communication is encouraged can help introduce new ideas, build a stronger sense of connection to work for team members, and mitigate confusion, especially in large-scale projects. As many teams shift toward agile methodologies, communication is key.\n\nBeyond the rapid technological advancements in project management, managers also must \u201cbecome expert problem-solvers, critical thinkers, communicators, and leaders,\u201d says Pietrangelo. \u201cWhile technological advancements lead to new processes and ways of working, project managers need to understand how to guide their teams through change and establish trust during uncertain times.\u201d\n\nSome ways to consider improving your project team\u2019s communication and transparency include:\n\nUtilizing asynchronous communication methods, like Slack or Microsoft Teams\n\nGiving frequent updates on project progress\n\nPromoting cross-team collaboration on projects\n\nBottom line: Understanding trends in project management\n\nIn 2024, staying ahead of the curve means embracing project management trends like leveraging AI, making data-driven decisions, and prioritizing ESG practices. Ensuring your business is flexible and adaptable to the ebbs and flows of the project management landscape is crucial for ensuring your projects meet business goals and deliver meaningful results.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat are the latest trends in project management?\n\nSome of the latest trends in project management include integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into project processes and relying on data to drive decisions. Other trends, like doing more with fewer resources and staying mindful of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices, are crucial for many project management teams.\n\nWhat are the future trends in project management?\n\nFuture trends in project management will rely heavily on technological advances. As AI becomes more broadly integrated, new ways to leverage it for project management are inevitable. Additionally, the environmental impact of projects will continue to be a priority for many businesses, and brainstorming project ideas that can improve how businesses impact and interact with the environment will only become more necessary as climate change evolves.\n\nWhat are some types of project management?"
