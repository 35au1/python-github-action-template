Now, it sounds like the next Galaxy AI addition will be derived from iPhones.\n\nLeaker chunvn8888 asserts on X that Samsung is offering a notification summary feature in a recent version of the One UI 7 beta (ending in \u201cXJW\u201d). This feature is apparently called AI notification and only supports the Korean language for now. We\u2019re guessing it\u2019ll support English and a few other languages when the stable version of One UI 7 is released.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, that\u2019s because iPhones support this functionality as part of the Apple Intelligence suite of AI features. Apple summarizes your notifications if you\u2019ve got two more notifications from the same source, and it works with almost any app. We called it the best part of Apple Intelligence, although there\u2019s still some room for improvement. So we hope Samsung\u2019s take on the feature works in a similar way while offering a little more polish.\n\nThe leaker also said this AI notification feature won\u2019t land on mid-range Galaxy phones, but we hope it will be available on plenty of older flagship Samsung phones.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the only major One UI 7 feature. The new Samsung software is expected to offer a split notification/quick settings menu, new icons, an overhauled camera app UI, and a Dynamic Island clone.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

Download Insider's app here.\n\nAll about AI, all the time\n\nGetty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BI\n\nThe trillion-dollar giants of Big Tech reported earnings this week, beating estimates and committing billions to AI. The big winners: Those able to signal a strong return on that investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlphabet\n\nGoogle's cloud business benefited from AI adoption, posting a 35% year-over-year increase in revenues, while CEO Sundar Pichai said more than a quarter of the company's new code is now created by AI. The core advertising business held strong despite growing competition from the likes of OpenAI, Reddit, and more.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe retail and cloud giant smashed expectations, sending the stock soaring on Friday. It also benefited from AI adoption, as cloud unit AWS posted a 19% increase in revenues. A strong performance in retail, where execs said shoppers were buying cheaper items at higher volumes, and a sharp focus on cost control had investors cheering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple\n\nApple beat revenue and profit estimates overall, but a year-over-year decline in revenue in China left investors underwhelmed. All eyes are now on demand for the iPhone 16 and whether new Apple Intelligence features help juice sales.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta beat estimates, though user growth came in below expectations. Mark Zuckerberg promised to keep spending on AI and flexed Meta's huge cluster of Nvidia H100 chips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft also beat estimates, but concerns around capacity constraints in AI and the return on its investments in the space led the tech giant's stock lower across the week.\n\nInside \"Project Rodeo\"\n\nGetty Images; iStock; Natalie Ammari/BI\n\nIn preparation for its future of autonomous vehicles, Tesla has been leaning on a specialized group of test drivers, part of what's known internally as \"Project Rodeo.\"\n\nBI spoke with nine test drivers, who described sometimes perilous scenarios and near-crashes while testing unreleased software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's what they said.\n\nRethinking corporate careerism\n\nJames Yates for BI\n\nScaling the corporate ladder was once a cornerstone of the American dream. Now, 42% of Americans say they don't even want a promotion, according to a survey by global HR consultancy Randstad.\n\nThat's higher than the countries known for being more chill about work, like Italy, Spain, and New Zealand. The anti-advancement shift has left bosses scratching their heads. If promotions won't motivate workers, what will?\n\nPacking up the corporate ladder.\n\nThe disappearing tech freebies\n\nMint Images - David Arky/Getty, masterzphotois/Getty, Tyler Le/BI\n\nAfter years of upping the ante with everything from exercise classes to laundry services, tech companies are clamping down on freebies. It's part of a wider push to cut costs across the industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lavish perks culture, once aimed at subsidizing nearly everything, led to entitlement and rule-bending among some employees. In a new era of efficiency and layoffs, tech workers need to get used to a new, non-extravagant normal.\n\nUse it, don't abuse it.\n\nA Pacific-theater practice round\n\nBI\n\nAs tension builds in the Indo-Pacific region, the United States Army is training warfighters for combat if a conflict with China breaks out.\n\nBI's Graham Flanagan spent two weeks in Hawaii to document the Army's sprawling, $16 million war-games exercise across the island chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch the documentary here.\n\nThis week's quote:\n\n\"We were appalled to hear the non-data-driven explanation you gave for Amazon imposing a 5-day in-office mandate.\"\n\n\u2014 Amazon employees in a signed letter to AWS CEO Matt Garman, protesting his return-to-office comments.\n\nMore of this week's top reads:"

        "article_content": "Sleep paralysis and the illusion of ghostly encounters\n\n\n\nCarbon Monoxide: The silent phantom behind ghostly visions\n\n\n\nBrain anomalies: Exploring neurological causes of paranormal sensations\n\n\n\nEmotional grief and ghostly experiences: The power of memories\n\n\n\nAlso Read |\n\nGhostly encounters and paranormal experiences have fascinated and terrified people for centuries, often being attributed to supernatural forces . However, as The Daily Guardian reports, scientific research increasingly challenges these mystical explanations, revealing how our mind, body, and environment can create ghostly sensations.Conditions such as sleep paralysis, carbon monoxide exposure, neurological abnormalities, and emotional states like grief can all lead to experiences that mimic ghostly sightings. Researchers have even found that stimulating certain brain regions can cause illusions of ghostly presences. While these findings shed light on why people may perceive apparitions, they also remind us of the limits of our understanding, leaving some mystery intact.Let\u2019s explore these surprising causes behind paranormal experiences and how science and the mind intersect to create eerie perceptions.One possible explanation for ghost sightings is sleep paralysis, as noted by The Daily Guardian. The NHS describes this condition as a temporary inability to move or speak while transitioning between sleep and wakefulness. Sleep paralysis occurs during REM sleep\u2014a phase when the brain is most active\u2014and can lead to vivid, intense dreams.People experiencing sleep paralysis often report sensations of chest pressure or terrifying visions of shadowy figures, a phenomenon historically associated with supernatural folklore and known as \u201cold hag syndrome.\u201dAnother surprising source of ghostly visions could be carbon monoxide. This colourless, odourless gas, often produced by malfunctioning appliances, can cause confusion and vivid hallucinations. Historical reports dating as far back as the 1920s have linked carbon monoxide exposure to ghostly experiences, as victims described seeing or hearing things that were not there.Recent research shows that brain abnormalities can also trigger paranormal-like sensations. A 2017 case study involving a 26-year-old epilepsy patient found that stimulating the fusiform face area (FFA)\u2014the part of the brain responsible for facial recognition\u2014caused unsettling hallucinations in which familiar faces transformed into distorted, cartoon-like figures.Similarly, a 22-year-old epilepsy patient reported sensing a \u201cpresence\u201d behind her when specific brain areas were activated. Neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease can also lead to ghostly visions, making these experiences more common than one might assume.Ghostly experiences can also stem from profound emotional responses, especially during intense grief. Studies show that people often \u201csee\u201d or \u201chear\u201d deceased loved ones. Psychologists attribute this to \u201cschemas\u201d\u2014mental patterns formed through familiar routines and strong emotional bonds. After a loved one\u2019s passing, these schemas can be so powerful that the sense of their presence lingers as a vivid, almost tangible memory.So, the next time you catch sight of a shadow or hear a familiar voice, consider that it may be your brain, a gas leak, or the mysteries of sleep at work. While science has provided explanations for many ghostly encounters, there remains a space for the unknown, leaving us to wonder about what lies beyond the reach of our understanding."

        "article_content": "Orange County\u2019s fastest growing public companies are a diverse mix of real estate, biotech, software and hospitality industries. The 25 fastest-growing public companies headquartered in Orange County based on revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 generated $33.6 billion in revenue combined for 2023 \u2013 that\u2019s an increase of 27% from the $26.5 billion reported for 2022.\n\nFive Point Leads\n\nThe fastest growing public company headquartered in Orange County is Five Point Holdings LLC, an owner and developer of residential mixed-use developments in Orange County, Los Angeles County and San Francisco. The Irvine-based company reported revenue of $212 million in 2023, up by 396% from 2022. Revenues were primarily generated from land sales at its Valencia site, where it closed the sale of land entitled for an aggregate of 729 homesites on approximately 72 acres for $162.4 million. In total, Five Point communities are designed to include approximately 40,000 residential homes and approximately 23 million square feet of commercial space.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to closely monitor the market and interest rates; however, we believe that the ongoing housing supply shortage will help sustain strong demand for our land,\u201d said Dan Hedigan, Five Point chief executive, in a statement.\n\nNext-Level Automotive\n\nElectric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive Inc. was the second-fastest-growing company with $4.43 billion in revenue last year, up 167% from the prior year. The Irvine-based automaker produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122, which more than doubled the totals from 2022. However, growth for 2024 was tempered due to higher interest rates and the company projects to match vehicle production from 2023.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Rivian unveiled the newest version of its inventory. The midsize platform underpins R2, R3 and R3X vehicles. Pricing for R2 is expected to start around $45,000, and R3 will be priced below R2 with deliveries expected in 2026.\n\n\u201cOur design and engineering teams are extremely focused on driving innovation into not only the product features but also our approach to manufacturing to achieve dramatically lower costs,\u201d said Rivian founder and chief executive RJ Scaringe, in a statement.\n\nBiotech Growth\n\nBiotech, pharmaceutical and medical device companies account for six of the top 10 fastest-growing public companies headquartered in Orange County. RxSight Inc., an ophthalmic medical device company based in Aliso Viejo, had its initial public offering in 2021 and recently raised an additional $115 million through a secondary public offering that closed in May. The company is dedicated to providing customized vision to patients following cataract surgery.\n\nAxonics Inc., a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of differentiated devices to treat urinary and bowel dysfunction, announced plans to be acquired by Boston Scientific Corp. in January for $3.7 billion. This deal had not yet closed as of print time, because the Federal Trade Commission has asked for additional information during the acquisition review process.\n\n"

        "article_content": "PostgreSQL database platform company Timescale has expanded its PostgreSQL AI toolset with the launch of pgai Vectorizer.\n\nThis is an open source (cloud hosted) software offering that promises to enable developers to build advanced AI applications without the need for external tools or specialised expertise.\n\nAs a popular database, PostgreSQL is used by 49% of developers worldwide according to StackOverflow.\n\nTimescale says it is dedicated to bringing cutting-edge technology to the PostgreSQL community, without needing specialized tooling or knowledge. The company did this by extending PostgreSQL for real-time analytics. Now Timescale brings AI to PostgreSQL with the pgai suite and the launch of pgai Vectorizer.\n\nManaging multiple tools Developers are under growing pressure to deliver AI systems such as search engines, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and AI agents. However, this often involves managing complex workflows across multiple tools: embedding creation, data processing and real-time synchronisation. New specialised tools emerge daily, adding infrastructure overhead and demanding new expertise, but few have the operational maturity or flexibility required for production. Pgai Vectorizer integrates the entire embedding process into PostgreSQL, allowing developers to create, store and manage vector embeddings alongside relational data without external tools or added infrastructure. Together with the full pgai suite, it integrates the entire AI workflow into PostgreSQL, simplifying complex workflows into a single system. This enables developers to build state-of-the-art AI applications with fewer resources using familiar SQL commands. \u201c[I feel that] pgai Vectorizer is a game-changer. It promises to streamline our entire AI workflow, from embedding creation to real-time synchronization, allowing us to deliver AI applications faster and more efficiently,\u201d said Web Begole, CTO at MarketReader.\u201cBy integrating everything directly into PostgreSQL, pgai Vectorizer removes the need for external tools and expertise, making it easier for our team to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure.\u201d Thousands of developers are already using the pgai suite of AI tools, and with pgai Vectorizer, they now have even greater power to streamline workflows and accelerate AI development."
