Looks like there\u2019s lots of reflection on the side of the vehicle. Not sure if that\u2019s from traffics or what.\"\n\nWhile another thought: \"It was just something tied to the door tied tight to hold it open. If you watch the door starts to close right before it happened.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThen a third argued: \"Not... really. Just actually look at the reflection and you see it actually goes on a lot longer than the 'object'.\n\n\"What likely happened here is the guy got knocked out by something from inside, or got electrocuted and jumped back.\n\n\"And at the exact same time some bug lit up in front of the camera.\"\n\nThe clip has divided the viewers (Reddit/u/kamm03)\n\nAdvert\n\nSomeone else also questioned: \"Idk.. the fact that the dog goes immediately towards where the object came from kinda freaks me out. Right after that, the dog does move to the body on the ground but its attention is immediately taken to that area. I wonder if the dog's sniffer picked something up.\"\n\n\"The eagle eyes that spotted the object circling around the cement mixer help confirmed depth and motion,\" a fifth added. \"This is a bug that is flying to the left, then towards the camera then up and over the top right edge of the camera nearly directly at it. Velocity and size of the object increase relatively proportionally to each other.\"\n\nWhatever your opinion, we can surely all agree how weird it is?"

While it\u2019s certainly not the first time someone reported seeing strange flying objects in the sky over San Antonio, it\u2019s an unusually clear video of what folks believe to be a UFO.\n\nA TikTok user shared a video of a mysterious rotating object hovering in the sky off North Alamo Street in Downtown San Antonio. While it appeared metallic or white in the video, the TikTok poster, Justin Delgado, says it nearly blended in with the darkest part of the sky.\n\nWhen the video was shared on Reddit, several commenters noted they\u2019ve been seeing mysterious objects in the sky more frequently as of late. Some said reports or quickly cropping up in New Mexico, Arizona and across the globe while other say they\u2019ve seen suspicious activity in Texas.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cI seen it all the way from Lacoste,\u201d Reddit user Historical_Wish_7627 commented. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing lots of weird stuff in the sky lately.\u201d\n\nAnother Reddit poster who lives in a rural area outside San Antonio reported seeing what looked like a satellite moving across the sky one night that faded into the night sky. The same poster says they saw a pair of mysterious lights, which they say wasn\u2019t a helicopter or airplane, hovering over the Alamo City.\n\nOthers were quick to quips on the speculation of aliens visiting San Antonio. In reference to a recent video of a mattress flying down a highway in the city, having dislodged off the back of a fast-moving pickup truck, Reddit users joked the mattress had made it into airspace.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe highway mattress has breached containment,\u201d Reddit user audientix posted, with many responding with their own jokes about the mattress being the sources of the conspiracy. There were plenty of other jokes to be made on the thread without reference to a mattress, though.\n\n\u201cThat was abuela\u2019s chancla after whooping you so hard it was sent into orbit,\u201d Reddit user Chiken_97 wrote."

            "article_content": "An AI-powered 'Death Clock' can 'predict' when you die. (Representational)\n\nA new Artificial Intelligence-powered app is making waves\u2014by predicting the day you will die. Dubbed the Death Clock, the app uses AI to forecast an individual\u2019s lifespan down to the second, leaving users equal parts intrigued and unsettled. But is it a revolutionary health tool or a morbid curiosity?\n\nHow It Works: Science or Speculation?\n\n\n\nAvailable on both Google Play and the Apple Store, the Death Clock app uses data from 1,200 international life expectancy studies covering 53 million participants. It incorporates health markers such as cholesterol levels, blood sugar, workout routines, water intake, and even the quality of personal relationships to make its predictions. Developers claim the app\u2019s insights are backed by research from authoritative sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nBrent Franson, the app's developer, argues that it goes beyond morbid fascination. \"Death Clock is not just to scare you. We give you an evaluation of your health,\" Franson said in an interview with DailyMail. He explained that the app combines traditional longevity data with advanced AI algorithms, drawing from studies by health and life insurance companies. \u201cWe added an AI layer on top of the best-in-class methodologies,\u201d Franson said.\n\nUsers are encouraged to answer questions honestly to get accurate results. Queries range from health-focused\u2014like daily sugar intake and cardio frequency\u2014to personal, such as the age of one\u2019s grandparents and the state of mental health. The results? A digital grim reaper delivering your death sentence, complete with causes like cancer or cardiovascular disease and a countdown clock ticking away.\n\nWhile some users see the app as a wake-up call to improve their lifestyles, others are less enthused. One X user sarcastically remarked, \"Just what I needed\u2014an app to tell me that my late-night taco runs are slowly killing me!\" Another joked, \"Forget motivation talks, I\u2019ve got the AI Death Clock counting down my calories and life.\"\n\nAlongside death predictions, it provides personalised recommendations to extend life. For instance, one user reported that incorporating weightlifting and increasing cardio could add three years to their lifespan. The app highlights the role of muscle health and metabolic stability, with Franson advising users to make the most of its free trial. \u201cThere\u2019s probably not a more important date in your life than the day that you\u2019re going to die,\u201d he quipped.\n\nWhat Sets It Apart?\n\nThe Death Clock claims to outperform standard life tables, which actuaries and demographers commonly use. Life tables predict population-level life expectancy but lack the individual-specific nuance the Death Clock offers. By incorporating stress management, nutrition, and mental health into its algorithm, the app aims to show that death dates aren\u2019t set in stone.\n\nFor those willing to pay, the app offers detailed longevity plans via monthly ($15) or annual ($60) subscriptions. The free three-day trial allows users to explore basic predictions and advice."

It\u2019s not a horror game, so to speak, but \u2013 drenched in atmosphere and oozing creative creatures \u2013 it\u2019s a haunting and engrossing location to search and slice your way through.\n\nIt\u2019s also impossible to ignore Enigma of Fear\u2019s beautiful art design, seamlessly blending pixel art sprites with old-school-style 3D environments. These visuals go a long way in making the Perimeter and the mystery at its heart that much more engrossing.\n\nEnigma of Fear is currently available at a 10% discount, costing just $22.49 / \u00a318.89 on Steam until Thursday, December 5.

The three co-direct and are featured in this 55-minute show, with visuals by Xuan, the film by Four/Ten Media and music by Finkelmeier. Their work has amassed 15 nominations and awards, including from the Wisconsin Film Festival.\n\nLaurenz\u2019 great-great uncle and accomplished writer Lafcadio Hearn is the muse behind \u201cDESCENDED.\u201d A 19th century journalist, wayward traveler, teacher and meta-folk-ghost-story writer, Hearn followed his heart into the unknown.\n\nHearn\u2019s metaphysical literature explores paranormal and dissonant cognitive states, and Laurenz found peace through his story as she navigated the uncertainties of a career in the arts.\n\n\u201cI found a lot of hope and inspiration in how one can build a beautiful life that wanders,\u201d Laurenz said. \u201cIt gave me so much comfort just to know that I come from somebody like that.\u201d\n\nIn their post-performance Q&A, the artists shared how liberating they feel letting go of the sheet music and focusing on gestures and the narrative arc. Rather than sticking to a rigid plan, they bring about authentic evocations, connecting to their storytelling on a deeply emotional level."

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Mac security provider Moonlock, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u2019\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The fate of Google\u2019s Pixel Tablet seems uncertain at this point, with multiple leaks suggesting that a successor was put on ice. It seems, however, that a Pixel Tablet 2 moved into advanced stages of development with some neat upgrades before it was unceremoniously axed.\n\nThe folks over at Android Authority, citing internal documents, report that the second-generation Pixel Tablet would\u2019ve arrived armed with the Tensor G4 silicon, which also powers the Google Pixel 9 series smartphones. Google was also reportedly eyeing a cellular version with a Samsung Exynos 5G modem for the slate.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe biggest upgrade, however, would have been the display. The Pixel Tablet was apparently lined up for a 120Hz refresh rate screen, alongside a slight bump in the peak brightness figures.\n\nThe current-gen Pixel Tablet offers a 60Hz LCD screen, which is arguably subpar for the asking price of $499 at the very minimum. \u201cScrolling through menus, apps, etc., looks slow and choppy on the Pixel Tablet \u2014 as do any system animations,\u201d said the Digital Trends review of the slate.\n\nIt certainly didn\u2019t help that the software was brimming with bugs, the battery life was underwhelming, and the overall design was far less functionally thoughtful than what one expects from the Pixel team.\n\nGoogle is also said to have earmarked imaging upgrades for the Pixel Tablet 2. The front camera was reportedly upgraded to a 10-megapixel sensor (up from 8-megapixel on the first-gen Pixel Tablet), while the rear camera switched from an 8-megapixel unit to an 11-megapixel snapper.\n\n\u201cThe last upgrade Google was going to bring to the tablet was support for DisplayPort output up to 4K,\u201d adds the report. The company was reportedly planning an updated lineup of accessories for the tablet, including a keyboard case, as well.\n\nThe other noteworthy improvement was a bump in the battery size, going from 6,900mAh to 7,200mAh capacity. That\u2019s not exactly substantial, but for a tablet plagued by battery efficiency woes, any progress would have been welcome.\n\nNotably, the company hasn\u2019t entirely abandoned its tablet ambitions yet. In fact, work on a supposed Pixel Tablet 3 is reportedly underway, and a souped-up version targeting a 2026 launch is also said to be in the pipeline.\n\nWhat\u2019s worrisome is Google\u2019s historically lackadaisical approach to committing to a form factor and making iterative upgrades to it in the long run. The Pixel Tablet falls into one such category, even though Google has moved firmly into an adjacent one with its recent focus on folding phones \u2014 most recently, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\n\nAndroid, despite making significant progress with foldable-first software optimizations, still isn\u2019t quite ready for tablet computing. However, it seems the company\u2019s solution to that laggardness would be rather shocking.\n\nAs per Android Authority, Google is planning to unify Chrome OS into Android in hopes of competing with Apple\u2019s iPad and the iPad platform. Will that be enough to save the Pixel Tablet hopes? Only time will tell.\n\nIn hindsight, Google could snag two trophies in a single attempt by concentrating the efforts on maintaining two ailing platforms and injecting more energy into a unified Android-based architecture for large-screen devices."
