        "article_content": "In the final moments of \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs,\u2018 the line between reality and fiction blurs as Jos\u00e9 de Zer loses himself in his search for the UFO. After a series of inexplicable events showcase themselves, the fakery being utilized by the protagonist to sell the vision to the watching public takes on a whole new dimension as certain elements prove themselves to be far more mysterious than established in the beginning. As Jos\u00e9 overcomes his feelings of imposter syndrome, a different kind of belief instills within him as he tries to find salvation in the message he has been spreading among his followers. However, it causes the movie to end in a very confusing way, which flips the script on the whole narrative! SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nThe Man Who Loved UFOs Plot Synopsis\n\nJos\u00e9 de Zer, an entertainment journalist for a TV news channel, suffers a seizure while interviewing a high-profile celebrity, Monica. The attack is triggered after Jos\u00e9 sees a blinding white light hovering above the sky and a strange high-pitched sound in his head. Subsequently, he wakes up in the hospital while his cameraman, Chango, watches him. One day, two residents from the nearby village of La Candelaria visit him at the hospital and propose for him to cover the story about a burnt pasture in their area. They suggest that the protagonist avail himself of a different angle, namely aliens, as they want tourism to spread in their small community, which has been lacking in advancement over the years.\n\nSubsequently, Jos\u00e9 embarks on a trip to La Candelaria with Chango and finds the burnt pasture in one of the surrounding hills. He conducts several interviews with the locals, who mostly speak about a UFO conspiracy being hidden by the government and higher authorities. With the recorded footage, the reporter heads back to his TV channel headquarters and presents it to his bosses, who disapprove of the idea immediately. Their reservations are mostly levied at Jos\u00e9\u2019s embellishment of the report to make it more exaggerated than usual. However, after various persuasive talks, the protagonist convinces them to air the video during the TV news show \u2018Notidiario.\u2019 When it is presented to the public, more doctored evidence is shown, such as burnt insects lying on the charred pasture.\n\nAs soon as the footage is released, the audience\u2019s interest in UFO sightings swells as Jos\u00e9 slowly becomes a household name. Despite being relegated to more obscure entertainment news over the years, his newfound fame drives more attention to his paranormal claims. More support is pumped into his venture as the journalist starts building a crew around himself who help him fabricate the alien story at a higher production level, which includes a mysterious engineer and self-proclaimed alien enthusiast named Sixto Schiaffino. However, amidst the fakery employed by the protagonist, things start heating up as sightings of real inexplicable saucers start appearing in real life. While he continues to believe in their reality, his daughter Martina is not entirely convinced of her dad\u2019s theories.\n\nThe Man Who Loves UFOs Ending: Are the Aliens Actually Real?\n\nOne of the most confusing and yet pivotal aspects of \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs\u2019 revolves around the existence of the aliens. Although Jos\u00e9 seems to have faith in their existence, for much of the narrative, he employs dodgy schemes to construct a fake reality to make others believe like him. It suggests that the aliens are simply a construct that the protagonist is using to garner more attention to his work, as he has somehow managed to enrapture them with his style of narration. However, the tricky part of the story is how it plays with the idea of belief and how it can determine what people see as real or not. In fact, during a conversation with his daughter, Jos\u00e9 mentions the same thing to her, telling her that if she believed the aliens did not exist, then they also did not exist in reality.\n\nIt adds a layer of complexity to the narration, especially in the later parts as the mysterious events start ramping up. Initially, the so-called alien visits are only relegated to a flashback in Jos\u00e9\u2019s past, specifically when he got lost in the Sinai desert during the Israel war. Whether it is real or not is left up to the audience at that point, with a majority of people likely to side with the latter. However, doubts start creeping in when the reporter becomes acquainted with Sixto Schiaffino, a man he calls Mr. Engineer. From the get-go, the movie presents him with a mysterious aura, albeit seeming ordinary on the surface. The more Jos\u00e9 dives into his supposed delusions, the more Mr. Engineer offers him spiritual advice and encourages him to keep spreading the words of the aliens.\n\nIn many ways, the movie revolves around the power of belief, and initially, Jos\u00e9 is far from a believer. He even expresses to Chango how skeptical he is of a higher power like God, considering the cruelties in the world. Meanwhile, his cameraman assures him that he himself is a believer. As the narrative progresses, the protagonist undergoes a radical shift in his belief system, going from someone who barely relates to any notion of divine authority to someone who clings to the grace and divinity of the aliens. To that end, the reality of the aliens within the story becomes a rather complicated discussion as it is mostly filtered through the eyes of Jos\u00e9. So, the answer might come down to a case of looking at the problem by subscribing to the protagonist\u2019s worldview from beginning to end.\n\nDoes Jose Survive the Cave Collapse?\n\nIn the final part, an excited Jos\u00e9 leads an expedition into a mining cave in the hills of La Candelaria, expecting to find answers to his burning questions about the aliens. After having spent months in the village concocting various reports, the journalist is given one last opportunity to craft a big story before he must leave the place. Consequently, his final adventure also turns out to be one of the most life-changing events. It begins with a helicopter ride through the area around the burnt pasture, during which Jos\u00e9 witnesses a real UFO zipping through the sky. While following it through the air, he and Chango end up at the mining cave. They venture into it despite protestations on the part of his cameraman. Unfortunately, Jos\u00e9 ends up getting trapped in the cave after he moves in too deep, separating him from Chango.\n\nWhile being stuck under a pile of rubble, the protagonist uses his lighter to read the nearby cave walls, which are decorated with all manner of hieroglyphs, most of them eerily recounting his own story thus far. Another strange occurrence takes place as Mr. Engineer materializes out of nowhere and speaks with Jos\u00e9. This adds even more talking points to the reality of the aliens, as Sixto could not have entered the cave after it collapsed. Mr. Engineer picks up one of the cave hieroglyphics and hands it over to the protagonist before disappearing. A few moments later, he is rescued by the local firefighters, who drag him out of the cave on a stretcher.\n\nWhy Does the UFO Take Jos\u00e9?\n\nThe most concrete evidence of the aliens presents itself in the ending moments of the movie. After being carried out by the firefighters, Jos\u00e9 flags down his daughter Martina and tells her in a state of adrenaline that the aliens want to take him with them. He hands her the cave hieroglyphic before he is wheeled into the ambulance and driven away. While Martina studies the hieroglyphic, a monumental revelation takes place as a gigantic UFO appears out of the clouds and uses its traction beam to lift the ambulance. The crowd gathered around the cave watches in stunned silence as the protagonist is taken into the UFO just like he envisioned previously after hearing Mr. Engineer. It is a game-changing final twist that leaves the ending with a sense of ambiguity and wonder.\n\nThere are several ways to interpret the UFO\u2019s appearance at the end and its reasons for taking Jos\u00e9 with it. The straightforward reading suggests that the aliens always existed, and everyone was blind to them except the protagonist, who saw them first in the Sinai desert during the war. Additionally, Mr. Engineer is one of those aliens who is hiding among humanity and providing support to the reporter as he is the staunchest follower and believer in the existence of extraterrestrials. Therefore, when the UFO appears and takes Jos\u00e9 away, it is a reward for his devotion to their ideals and holding on to his convictions despite the world ridiculing him. While it explains most of the ending, there may be an additional aspect to it.\n\nYears ago, when Jos\u00e9 got lost in the Sinai desert while fighting in the Israeli war, he came close to death several times and did not see any way out. In his derelict state, the vision of the UFO appearing out of nowhere must have felt like a sign of divinity or that his prayers had been answered, even if he was not religious. This highlights the crux of the movie, which uses UFOs as a substitute for religious faith. For most of the narrative, Jos\u00e9 has been striving to achieve that feeling of connection he felt when the UFO first appeared to him. Thus, his attempts at fabricating a lie to make people believe is irrelevant to his intentions of surrendering to his belief entirely. Because he achieves full spirituality in the end, the UFO appears to take him away and reveal its existence to the public, who doubts Jos\u00e9 all along.\n\nRead More: Jos\u00e9 De Zer: What Happened to Him?

The changes happening locally and globally in computing have created an incredible, once-in-a-generation opportunity that DPI is well-situated to harness for our state.\"\n\nDPI South will be a \"quantum-focused facility\" established in partnership with globally recognized companies, officials said.\n\nThe plan also includes maintaining downtown headquarters as \"DPI North.\" The institute will continue to operate from 200 S. Wacker Drive while also looking at options for locating the new DPI North.\n\nKilleen said the institute is committed to maintaining its headquarters in downtown Chicago.\n\n\"As a public university system, we must ensure that we maximize the benefits of DPI's headquarters for us, the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois as this vital work continues,\" Killeen said.\n\nIn discussing these plans, UI officials said that the changes would allow the institute to \"optimize\" the impact of state funding and capitalize on opportunities presented by \"major shifts in technology\" as well as the federal CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nOver the seven years since DPI was announced, the potential of quantum computing to help solve challenges in a variety of areas \u2014 health care, food production, manufacturing and climate science, to name a few \u2014 has only become more evident, officials said.\n\nKilleen said the UI System has shared its new vision for DPI with Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who appreciated the magnitude of the opportunity and supports the expansion of its focus.\n\nThe state has provided $500 million for the institute and the Illinois Innovation Network, a network of research and innovation hubs throughout Illinois, under Pritzker's administration.\n\nThe state has also invested $500 million in developing the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park. Pritzker announced in July that the campus would be located at USX on the South Side of Chicago. It will be managed by a UI-led organization on behalf of the state and Pritzker."

        "article_content": "Dwarf planet Ceres (Credit: NASA/JPL-CalTech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA)\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \u2014 A dwarf planet hiding right in the middle of our solar system could be a surprising source of frozen water, astronomers reveal. A new study finds that Ceres, which sits in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, has a crust that\u2019s 90% ice. The discovery of this dirty ice crust has led scientists to believe this giant asteroid used to be a muddy water world. Astronomers have studied Ceres since it was first discovered in 1801. It is both a dwarf planet and the largest asteroid in our solar system. The protoplanet is spherical, with a diameter of approximately 590 miles, and is riddled with craters, volcanoes, and landslides. In 2007, NASA sent the Dawn spacecraft to study Ceres. It reached the dwarf planet in 2015 and orbited it until 2018. While examining the rough surface, astronomers ruled out any signs of water existing on the asteroid because of the visible craters all over the surface. The common belief was that Ceres is relatively dry, with less than 30% ice.\n\nHowever, the new study, published in the journal Nature Astronomy, argues that scientists might have judged this crater-rich planetoid too soon. The way the craters formed and the planet\u2019s mass suggest an ice-rich environment. Using spectrographic data from the Dawn mission and computer simulations, the researchers noticed that there may be ice in Ceres\u2019s subsurface. Gravity data also showed a density value close to that of impure ice. \u201cWe think that there\u2019s lots of water-ice near Ceres surface, and that it gets gradually less icy as you go deeper and deeper,\u201d says Mike Sori, an assistant professor in Purdue University\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, in a media release. \u201cPeople used to think that if Ceres was very icy, the craters would deform quickly over time, like glaciers flowing on Earth, or like gooey flowing honey. However, we\u2019ve shown through our simulations that ice can be much stronger in conditions on Ceres than previously predicted if you mix in just a little bit of solid rock.\u201d The researchers mapped out a geographical profile of an actual crater from Ceres and used the information to create computer simulations. The computer simulations modeled how the dwarf planet\u2019s craters relax and deform over billions of years. (Credit: Purdue University)\n\nAccording to the authors, the findings suggest Ceres was once a frozen ocean world similar to one of Jupiter\u2019s moons, Europa. The muddy ocean froze over time, creating an icy crust with some trapped rock. The ice-rich crust had found some way to resist crater relaxation. \u201cTo me the exciting part of all this, if we\u2019re right, is that we have a frozen ocean world pretty close to Earth,\u201d adds Sori. \u201cCeres may be a valuable point of comparison for the ocean-hosting icy moons of the outer solar system, like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus.\u201d The new findings could also warrant a manned space mission to the crater-rich dwarf planet as it may be one of the best chances astronauts have to visit an icy world. \u201cSome of the bright features we see at Ceres\u2019 surface are the remnants of Ceres\u2019 muddy ocean, now mostly or entirely frozen, erupted onto the surface. So we have a place to collect samples from the ocean of an ancient ocean world that is not too difficult to send a spacecraft to,\u201d Sori concludes."

Rather than being a single entity, Gliese 229B is now recognized as a duo of brown dwarfs, designated Gliese 229Ba and Gliese 229Bb.\n\nLocated just 19 light-years away in the constellation Lepus, these two dwarfs are locked in a rare binary configuration, orbiting each other every 12 days at an exceptionally close distance. Both brown dwarfs have masses well over that of Jupiter, marking a significant discovery in the study of these enigmatic celestial objects.\n\nThis discovery challenges prevailing theories, particularly given their smaller diameter compared to Jupiter despite having a higher mass. Researchers continue to explore how brown dwarfs form and the complexities involved in distinguishing them from planets or stars.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

Next Article Next Article\n\nStaurikosaurus fossil offered clues to dinosaur origins\n\nGoogle Doodle honors Staurikosaurus, an early dinosaur discovery\n\nBy Akash Pandey 01:24 pm Oct 19, 202401:24 pm\n\nWhat's the story Today's Google Doodle pays tribute to the revolutionary discovery of Staurikosaurus, an early theropod dinosaur that has played a key role in helping us understand the origins and evolution of these creatures. The animated doodle shows a Staurikosaurus swiftly traversing an ancient landscape, highlighting its speed and agility. It also shows the dinosaur's distinctive long tail and bipedal stance, along with serrated teeth hinting at its predatory nature.\n\nDiscovery details\n\nStaurikosaurus: A significant find in dinosaur evolution\n\nPaleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Prince first discovered the Staurikosaurus in 1936, at the Santa Maria Formation in southern Brazil. Radiocarbon dating techniques have established that this ancient predator lived during the late Triassic period, some 225 million years ago. The dinosaur was relatively large for its time, measuring about two meters long and weighing around 30kg. Its bipedal stance and long tail indicate a fast-moving predator who was well-equipped to catch and hold prey.\n\nEvolutionary significance\n\nCrucial piece in the dinosaur evolution puzzle\n\nThe discovery of Staurikosaurus has been instrumental in furthering our understanding of dinosaur evolution. By studying this early theropod, paleontologists have been able to put together the puzzle of how these creatures first appeared on Earth and embarked on their remarkable journey. The Staurikosaurus continues to inspire awe and wonder, reminding us of the diversity and complexity of life that has existed on our planet."
