The one exception is his new version of Too Hot To Handle, originally from the band\u2019s 1977 album Lights Out, which he played on but didn\u2019t have a hand in writing.\n\nIn an interview in the brand new issue of Classic Rock magazine, Schenker reveals that he record the song as a tribute to bassist Way and guitarist/keyboard player Raymond, who died in 2019 and 2020 respectively.\n\n\u201cThese are my songs, with the exception of Too Hot To Handle, which is in memory of Paul Raymond and Pete Way,\u201d the German-born guitarist explains, adding: \u201cI still play UFO songs live, I dedicate them to both of them. I have a picture collage here [in his home] with all the guys I have lost over the years. Paul and Pete are part of it. I see them every day.\u201d\n\nMy Years With UFO coincides with the 50th anniversary of Phenomenon, the first album the then-17-year-old Schenker recorded with UFO after joining them from the Scorpions. In the Classic Rock interview, the guitarist recalls how Way took him under his wing.\n\n\u201cPete was a great guy,\u201d says the guitarist. \u201cI never saw him angry. But he was also very shy \u2013 he covered it up with all sorts of stuff. He was an open, innocent person. When it came to his girlfriends, he was very much an underdog. I heard stories about him not even having the guts to tell his wife he was going on tour, cos she would have locked him up. I think he suffered a lot in his life, but everybody loved him.\u201d\n\nSchenker had a thornier relationship with UFO singer Phil Mogg. The guitarist insists that he quit the band after Mogg punched him in the stomach (something Mogg has always denied). In the interview, Schenker reveals that he doesn\u2019t know if his old bandmate is even aware of his new album. Even though both men live in the British seaside town of Brighton these days, their paths rarely cross.\n\n\u201cI see him once in a while at the zebra crossing,\u201d says Schenker of the singer. \u201cWhen Paul Raymond died, I saw Phil in a parking lot. I cornered him so he couldn\u2019t escape: \u2018Hey Phil, come over here!\u2019 I gave him a big hug.\u201d\n\nMy Years With UFO, which sees Schenker recruiting a host of guest vocalist, also features a high-profile appearance from Guns N\u2019 Roses singer Axl Rose on a new version of UFO\u2019s Love To Love. The collaboration came about after Schenker enlisted Axl\u2019s GN\u2019R bandmate Slash to appear on a different song, Mother Mary. Axl actually song three different UFO tracks \u2013 including Too Hot To Handle and Only You Can Rock Me \u2013 before greenlighting Love To Love.\n\n\u201cAxl is a perfectionist,\u201d says Schenker. \u201cHe puts everything under the microscope. He was not happy with his performance on Too Hot To Handle and Only You Can Rock Me, but he did such a great version of Love To Love.\n\n\u201cHe would go back into the studio and do something else: \u2018It\u2019s not right yet, it\u2019s not right yet!\u2019 We waited and waited, and eventually he got it. It\u2019s a really good song for Axl to sing.\u201d\n\nRead the full interview with Michael Schenker in the brand new issue of Classic Rock, featuring Thin Lizzy on the cover and on sale now.

        "source": "The Mirror",
        "article_content": "This September played host to several quirky and charming indie games that may have slipped under your radar. Here's the best of the best of what we played.\n\nIf you thought that this year was already jam-packed for huge AAA releases, the month of September just rolled in to prove that the same is very much true for indie gems. This isn\u2019t even taking into account the UFO 50-shaped elephant in the room, which justifiably impressed as a generous collection of retro style games. Disclaimer: I haven't had around to checking out UFO 50 myself yet, hence why it won\u2019t be appearing on this list. However, if you\u2019re looking for an eclectic selection of smaller-scale titles to enjoy between the heavy-hitters, I\u2019ve got you covered with the cream of the indie game crop (at least from what I played).\n\nSeptember 2024 really did have something for everyone, whether you\u2019re into 16-bit beat-em-up tributes or throwback survival horror. Interestingly there were less blockbuster sequels compared to the best indie games of August roundup, meaning that there was a lot of truly new indie game experiences to check out. Let\u2019s get into it\u2026\n\nThe Plucky Squire\n\nKicking us off is the undeniably charming and whimsical The Plucky Squire, which was a day one release on PS Plus in the Extra and Premium September lineup. A seemingly ordinary top-down action-adventure in the style of classic The Legend of Zelda entries, expectations are suddenly flipped (literally) as soon as hero Jot is given the power to jump off the page of his storybook home. What follows is a creative take on the format that sees you switching words to change the world around you, frequently hop from a 2D to 3D plane, and indulge in various kinds of gameplay styles, all in the effort of taking down the evil wizard behind it all. The Plucky Squire\u2019s reality-switching premise might lack a little lustre in the later hours, but it still serves as a near-perfect papercraft journey full of colour and heart.\n\nGrapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines\n\nThe first Grapple Dog swiftly became one of my favourite indie pixelated platformers ever when it released back in 2022. That\u2019s why I was pleased to see this sequel do brilliant justice to that already swing-tastic original, featuring even more levels and puzzles to navigate through, more beautiful GBA pixel art to bask in, and an all-new Grapple Dog buddy in Luna to play as. Luna\u2019s ability to shoot from afar makes for a noticeably distinct adventure compared to Pablo\u2019s initial solo outing, and Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines electing to split its levels between these two playstyles ensures that exploring the cosmos is never boring. The core grapple-swing mechanic fortunately also returns in full force in what is easily a follow-up that proves two dogs can be better than one.\n\nGI Joe: Wrath of Cobra\n\nImage: indie.io) indie.io)\n\nSomehow we\u2019ve ended up in a golden age for pixelated beat-em-up translations of kids shows from the 80s and 90s. The trend properly kicked off when TMNT: Shredder\u2019s Revenge arrived on the scene, which will soon be followed later this year with the equally-as-hyped Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita\u2019s Rewind. If you can\u2019t wait until then, though, GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra launched this month to fill this nostalgia-shaped hole, letting you play as the likes of Duke, Roadblock, and yes, Snake Eyes as part of a classic beat-em-up adventure. The pixel art is surprisingly gorgeous, and the super moves for all four characters each have a distinct flavour to make every playthrough feel slightly unique. This being a GI Joe game you better believe there\u2019s guns to pick up and use too, all of which come in handy in this surprisingly excellent 16-bit translation of the gung-ho toy brand.\n\nYars Rising\n\nYou needn\u2019t look far these days to find a half-decent Metroidvania on the indie games market. Developer WayForward has spent decades perfecting the art of making them, however, hence why its reinvention of the Atari\u2019s classic Yars series probably looks and plays as well as it does. Set in a noticeably cyberpunk future, you play as the titular hacker aiming to take down a corporate entity from within. There\u2019s the usual suite of powers to hunt down and acquire, of course, but setting Yars Rising apart is the way it reimagines the classic sprite-shooting gameplay of Yars' Revenge as hacking mini-games. Is Yars Rising as faithful a Metroidvania as they come? Yes, but it gained extra points as soon as I fought a boss called Missile Commander. Need I say more?\n\nChains of Fury Vol. 1\n\nHeavily inspired by the art of Hellboy\u2019s Mike Mignola and fast-paced firing of 90s boomer shooters, Chains of Fury Vol. 1 shoves both these aspects into a blender to result in one of the most distinct-looking indie FPS titles of the year. Such eye-grabbing graphics are backed up by fun and ferocious gameplay, where you\u2019re encouraged to blast through each destructible cell-shaded level by maintaining the highest kill combo. Using the environment ups the chances of improving your killing flow, as does engaging what\u2019s called Rage Mode to keep the momentum going. Though controller support on PC would be nice, and melee combat is rough around the edges, Chains of Fury\u2019s comic book aesthetic makes it worth a look for those who aren\u2019t yet sick of ripping and tearing in the style of classic Doom.\n\nBeyond Galaxyland\n\nImage: United Label) United Label)\n\nStar Wars meets The Last Starfighter (and a whole host of other coming-of-age 80s movies) in Beyond Galaxyland, an unabashed throwback to classic turn-based RPGs that comes touting a pretty unique art style. It\u2019s pixel-based, of course, but your perspective of this sci-fi meets fantasy world being projected at a slant gives each varied location you visit an otherworldly, almost diorama-like feel. You play as Doug, a human pulled into absurdity who must partner up with his pet guinea pig and blast across the stars in the hopes of saving his family back home on Earth. Mix in a pokemon-like creature-collecting mechanic, multiple planets to explore, and an eclectic selection of quirky side characters to fall in love with, and Beyond Galaxyland truly is the real deal for any player seeking a sci-fi RPG with heart.\n\nDeathsprint 66\n\nDeathsprint 66 is one of those fast-paced games that will truly only make sense once you feel it in your hands. As odd as it might seem, the best way to describe it is probably \u2018Tron meets Mario Kart\u2019, where the neon-drenched visuals are matched by brilliant sprint-boosting gameplay that feels just as addicting as when you achieve the perfect drift in the Nintendo Wii\u2019s version of Rainbow Road. For this reason, death initially comes easy in Deathsprint 66. Go figure! However, when you do fall into that flow state of endlessly surging, drifting, wall running, leaning, and grinding on top of maintaining a solid momentum, it makes breezing past the finish line worth it. There are a series of challenge modes that can be played single-player, but Deathsprint 66\u2019s brand of on-foot racing chaos is best enjoyed online with others.\n\nHollowbody\n\nIf you can\u2019t wait for Bloober Team\u2019s Silent Hill 2 remake to launch on PC and PS5 next month, then you\u2019ll be sure to scratch that PS2-style survival horror itch in Hollowbody. Besides, it\u2019s made even scarier by the fact that it takes place entirely within a wet and dreary interpretation of the UK (imagine that) albeit one set in the far future where the country has been ravaged by a virus. Unfortunately for Mica, it\u2019s her mission to venture inside the exclusion zone to try and track down a friend, solving puzzles, managing regularly depleted resources, and surviving all kinds of nightmares in order to get the job done. Hollowbody does an excellent job establishing the vibe of early 2000s horror games, setting in an oppressive mood that never once failed to keep me gripped and on edge.\n\nThe Holy Gosh Darn\n\nImage: Yogscast Games) Yogscast Games)\n\nI didn\u2019t know I needed such an irreverent and funny interpretation of the afterlife until I sat down to play The Holy Gosh Darn towards the end of the month. Playing as an angel Cassiel, you must try to prevent the invasion of an army of hellish phantoms, with your time-travelling mission to save heaven playing out much like your typical interactive adventure game; only it\u2019s packed with songs, quirky characters, and countless ways to influence events using your trusty time-rewinding device. The voice work is stellar, script on point, and I genuinely haven\u2019t laughed at a satirical game this much since, well, Thank Goodness You\u2019re Here last month. Honestly, interactive adventure games are rarely as witty or as slick as the Holy Gosh Darn, so genre fans should absolutely pay it some attention.\n\nSelfloss\n\nPonderous puzzle games with a not-so-subtle narrative metaphor underlining it all can be a dime a dozen these days. However, every so often one comes along with a unique setting and premise that I simply can\u2019t avoid. Selfloss was definitely an example of an indie game doing this to me this month, not least due to its distinctly Slavic-inspired stylings and visuals that help set it apart. You play as an elderly healer who endeavours to rid the world of an ailment by undertaking an epic journey by boat. One that sees him save the spirit of various dying creatures around him, such as giant turtles, whales, and the like. Puzzle-solving using his staff\u2019s beam of light is made excellent use of in each chapter, especially when you\u2019re required to temporarily separate the two. What it all amounts to is kept purposely obscure, but Selfloss kept me enraptured for the short time it lasted.\n\nSpecial mention: TMNT: Shredder\u2019s Revenge \u2013 Radical Reptiles DLC\n\nFirst added to PS Plus Extra and Premium lineup back in June 2023, TMNT: Shredder\u2019s Revenge is the gift that keeps on giving. Not only was the original 2022 game already a perfect encapsulation of the 80s TV show and the various arcade beat-em-ups of that era, but it continues to be supported via post-launch updates excellently. First came the Dimension Shock DLC that introduced Karai and Usagi, and now this month we received Radical Reptiles. Though not quite as feature-packed as the one that came before, playing as classic characters Mondo Gecko and Mona Lisa gives players yet another excuse to jump into this beautiful looking and playing beat-em-up with all-new animations and character art. Complete with a remixed soundtrack from the likes of Anamanaguchi and Button Masher, I\u2019ll never deny of having more ways to prevent Shredder from getting his revenge."

The capital base in India is very strong today\u2026 if few trillion dollars of value is created [globally] because of AI, given the talent base India has, it is possible to create 10% value from India,\u201d said Mukul Arora, Co-Managing Partner at early stage venture capital firm \ufeffElevation Capital\ufeff.\n\nSpeaking at TechSparks 2024, Arora, however, cautioned that India will have to work hard to secure its share of the market.\n\nAshutosh Sharma, head of investments for India and Southeast Asia at Prosus Ventures, noted that AI can help create customised solutions for India\u2019s population.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of AI in India is we have a problem of access to quality education, health, skilling, etc. We have tried hard to figure out ways to customise the access to quality education etc through internet 1.0 and 2.0 [but the impact] is very limited without AI,\u201d said Sharma.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem and we have technology and we need someone in the middle to build [solutions],\u201d he added.\n\nThe investors also warned against jumping into a sector just because it\u2019s currently \u2018hot\u2019 or \u2018in demand.\u2019\n\n\"Because of something that has happened over the last two years in the space, I will not back off. A founder\u2019s job is to prove the unproven. Education and access to quality education is a big problem to be solved,\" said Sharma. \"The onus is on us to figure out what product fits the market; unfortunately for us, there is very little to show for it.\" Prosus is also an investor in edtech companies BYJU\u2019S and Eruditus in India.\n\nArora echoed this sentiment, emphasising that the true measure of any idea\u2019s success is achieving Product-Market Fit (PMF) and customer validation.\n\n\u201cAlways listen to your customers. If you are getting validation there, then the next question is how to scale it. Don\u2019t worry about what the VCs are thinking, if they think a sector is hot, it is already too late,\u201d cautioned Arora.\n\nWhile starting up in India has never been easier\u2014with access to capital, technological advancements, and entrepreneurs who have set a global benchmark\u2014the investors emphasised the need to focus on solving unique problems for Indian consumers with high-quality solutions."

        "article_content": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nMost parents don\u2019t get very far into their new job before they encounter a situation that has them flummoxed. It could be infant sleep issues, toddler tantrums or screen time negotiations, but, inevitably, every parent will have the thought, \u201cWhere do I go from here?\u201d\n\nSome situations demand immediate action. You pick the shrieking toddler up in the middle of the parking lot for his own safety. Other times, you have a few minutes to mull over your response, perhaps consulting with a co-parent. What, for example, are the appropriate consequences for a child refusing to do her chores? Then there are the big decisions, like when to get your child a cell phone, that you may spend months or years worrying over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet there\u2019s a widespread cultural belief that good parenting (and good mothering, in particular) is mostly a matter of instinct, that if we could just tune in to our internal wisdom, all our doubts would resolve themselves.\n\nThis makes it difficult for parents to admit when they are uncertain or may have made a mistake. It can also prevent parents from reaching out for help if they feel shame about needing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, the proliferation of parenting \u201cexperts\u201d with varying types of credentials offering books, courses and podcasts is proof that many parents are hungry for advice. When we just don\u2019t know how to proceed, we would very much like a calm, measured voice to tell us which way to turn.\n\nBecky Kennedy, aka Dr. Becky, a psychologist who has been called \u201cthe parenting whisperer\u201d for millennials and who currently has almost 3 million followers on Instagram, would likely top many parents\u2019 lists of experts they wish they could have on speed dial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKennedy, who is both warm and unflappable, advocates for what she calls \u201csturdy parenting,\u201d which conjures an image of a parent as ballast for a ship navigating choppy water.\n\nStudy parenting, she said, is \u201cthe ability to effectively embody your authority while staying connected and validating and empathizing with our kids\u2019 feelings.\u201d\n\nA sturdy parent is not an authoritarian parent who puts an end to questioning with a sharp \u201cBecause I said so!\u201d They are also not a permissive parent who empathizes with a child\u2019s feelings and subsequently complies with all of a child\u2019s demands. A study parent manages \u2014 without collapsing or losing their cool \u2014 to both acknowledge (although not necessarily validate) their child\u2019s feelings and hold to the boundary they have set.\n\nHolding boundaries when it comes to kids\u2019 behavior actually helps kids feel safe. They don\u2019t truly want parents to bend to every one of their demands, Kennedy said. \u201cThat feels very dangerous to them, because they essentially feel like they\u2019re on a plane without a pilot,\u201d she added. Kids want to know that a competent leader is in charge and that you will get them safely to where they need to go.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no official training course or credentialing body for parents. Sometimes you manage to land the plane safely through blind guessing. Other times, you crash. Either experience, understandably, sends many frightened parents looking for expert guidance. We want an experienced pilot to show us how this whole thing is done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe chatbot does not suggest that I crouch down next to my child, hanging my head in shame and muttering, 'Oh my God, this is so humiliating,' which might or might not be what an actual human mother would have done in this situation.\u201d\n\nKennedy has been reaching her followers through social media, her website, books and podcast, and she has just launched a new app using AI technology that can give parents answers to their queries in real time.\n\n\u201cI realized with AI, I can now basically show up for parents around the globe in a way that\u2019s going to feel exactly like they\u2019re texting with me or like I\u2019m sitting right next to them,\u201d Kennedy told HuffPost.\n\nKennedy is not the first parenting expert to roll out an AI tool. Economist and author Emily Oster has Dewey, a \u201cpersonal librarian\u201d who will sort through all the content on her website to find the answer to questions such as, \u201cCan I eat sushi while I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d A quick perusal of the app store surfaces other options such as AI Parenting Coach and Granny: AI Parenting Coach, which are free to download but feature in-app purchases.\n\nWhen you sign up for Kennedy\u2019s The Good Inside app, which costs $279 annually or $84 for a three-month membership, you\u2019re first led through a series of questions about what kind of help you\u2019re looking for and what challenges you\u2019re facing. You then enter your children\u2019s names (or pseudonyms) and birthdates, and the app generates a \u201cdeck\u201d that you can spend a few minutes swiping through every day in order to hone your parenting skills, sort of like a language-learning app that promises to teach you through modest amounts of daily practice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou also get access to the chatbot. To test it out, I mined the depths of my imagination for a few completely random sample behaviors from children who exist only in the hypothetical.\n\nMinus the trademark warmth in her voice, the chatbot does indeed sound believably like Dr. Becky. Much as she advises parents to do, the virtual Dr. Becky begins each of her responses by empathizing with my frustration.\n\nWhen I type in, \u201cMy toddler is sitting on the floor of the subway station. She has taken off her socks and shoes and thrown them and is saying, \u2018I not going!\u2019 How do I get her back in her stroller?\u201d the app responds with reassurance: \u201cGosh, that sounds so tough \u2014 and you\u2019re definitely not alone in facing these toddler meltdowns. Toddlers are known for their strong-willed nature, especially during transitions!\u201d\n\nThe chatbot then suggests that I acknowledge my child\u2019s feelings (\u201cI see you\u2019re really upset and don\u2019t want to go\u201d) and then try giving her a controlled choice (\u201cWould you like to put your shoes on yourself, or should I help you?\u201d) or try making a game of it (\u201cLet\u2019s pretend we\u2019re racing to get your shoes on and hop into the stroller like a kangaroo!\u201d) It concludes with a gentle reminder (\u201cRemember, it\u2019s all about staying calm and showing empathy while guiding her back to the task\u201d) and ends with a little confidence-boosting (\u201cYou\u2019re doing an amazing job navigating these tricky moments!\u201d) to hit all the notes of a classic Dr. Becky response.\n\nNotably, the chatbot does not suggest that I crouch down next to my child, hanging my head in shame and muttering, \u201cOh my God, this is so humiliating,\u201d which might or might not be what an actual human mother would have done in this situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI then tried entering the same query into ChatGPT. It delivers a brief nod of sympathy (\u201cGetting your toddler back in the stroller during a meltdown can be tricky\u201d) along with a numbered list of suggestions that aren\u2019t substantially different from the Dr. Becky chatbot: \u201c1. Stay Calm and Use Humor ... 2. Offer a Choice ... 3. Distraction.\u201d Chat GPT also suggests that I may need to use \u201cPositive Reinforcement\u201d with a line such as, \u201cOnce you\u2019re back in the stroller, we can go see/do [something fun],\u201d stopping short of using the words \u201cbribe\u201d or \u201ccookie.\u201d Its final bullet point is: \u201cPhysical Assistance: If all else fails, you may need to calmly and gently place them back in the stroller, while explaining what\u2019s happening.\u201d I am reminded to \u201cstay patient\u201d as I do this, which is not exactly what the woman crouched on the floor of the subway station wants to hear. ChatGPT is apparently unconcerned with the issue of the socks and shoes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to take any AI-generated advice with a grain of salt. The information could be too generic, culturally inappropriate, outdated or even harmful.\u201d - Brooklyn-based psychologist Nanika Coor\n\nI asked Brooklyn-based psychologist Nanika Coor if she had any experience with a client using AI for a parenting issue.\n\nShe recalled how one mother, in a state of desperation as the clock neared midnight, asked ChatGPT how to get her toddler to go to sleep. \u201cI actually thought that chatGPT gave a pretty reasonable response,\u201d Coor said. But she \u201cnoticed that the answer didn\u2019t address the nuances, like the nature of the parent-child dynamic or the parent\u2019s mental and emotional state \u2014 which I knew played a role.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne big advantage of a chatbot app is its 24/7 availability. It\u2019s there with you at any hour, in any location. Coor thinks it\u2019s probably as good as a regular search engine when it comes to run-of-the-mill issues. In Dr. Becky\u2019s app, it\u2019s also easy to find situation-specific scripts, even without using the chatbot feature.\n\nBut if your child has multiple diagnoses or you\u2019re dealing with something complex, an app may be less useful as a resource.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to take any AI-generated advice with a grain of salt. The information could be too generic, culturally inappropriate, outdated or even harmful,\u201d said Coor, adding that it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for a parent to have data privacy concerns when entering personal information into an app.\n\nSupport Free Journalism Consider supporting HuffPost starting at $2 to help us provide free, quality journalism that puts people first.

In these situations, a parent would need individual therapy to learn to recognize their unique triggers and respond in an intentional way rather than a reactive one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a few helpful suggestions and a pep talk, AI may be able to do the trick \u2014 particularly a chatbot specifically geared toward parents, like Dr. Becky\u2019s. For insight into your particular family dynamics, however, you\u2019ll have to look inside yourself."

Danielle, who grew up in the 1920s timber cottage, claims she is experiencing eerie paranormal activity - leaving her kids ''petrified'\n\n\"I want to enjoy living here, but I just feel I can't because of the activity in the house,\" Danielle explains. The property, which has been in her family for over 35 years, holds significant sentimental value for her, and mother Elaine. However, the joy of returning to her roots has been overshadowed by ghostly encounters.\n\nDanielle recalls feeling watched as a child, and her sister once reported seeing a spirit resembling a nurse. She said: \"When I lived here as a child, I did feel like I was always being watched. My sister had seen a spirit in what was her bedroom, she thought that the lady was a nurse. She said she looked at her and then she disappeared. I never actually experienced seeing a ghost until I moved back recently,\u201d\n\nNow, her own children are having frightening experiences. \"I know my son has seen her, as he described her to me. He said he'd seen a lady in the toy room. I said to him, 'is she a happy ghost?' He said 'oh no mummy, she's angry',\" Danielle recounts.\n\nIn a particularly distressing incident, Danielle's four-year-old son ran to her bedroom in hysterics, claiming to have heard a deep gasping voice in his ear. She said: \"He was hysterical and he said to me that there was a voice in his ear that had taken a deep \u2018gasp\u2019. My children are petrified. As a mother, I just want to protect my children,\".\n\nDespite her attempts to rationalize these occurrences, Danielle is finding it difficult to ignore the paranormal activity. \"I try to brush it off and say to him 'it's your imagination', 'it's a dream', but I know that that's not the truth,\" she admits.\n\nThe situation has become so concerning that Danielle is contemplating moving house. \"This house is my absolute life, but if it did get even worse or carry on, then we would have to consider moving,\" she said.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to resolve the haunting and keep her family in their beloved home, Danielle has turned to a team of paranormal investigators for help.\n\nIn the eighth episode of the new sixth series of Help! My House is Haunted, airiedon Really on Friday 27 th September at 10pm (also available to stream on discovery+), in a desperate effort to protect her family and remain living in the house she loves, Danielle turns to the show\u2019s team of paranormal investigators Barri, Ian and Jayne for help.\n\nLocal historian Penny Griffith Morgan tells Jayne that during the Second World War, a bomb took out a local hospital in Chaldon, where a young nurse called Pauline died, trapped in the rubble. She claims this could be the nurse that Danielle has seen as a spirit.\n\nWatch Episode 8 of the new sixth series of Help!

        "article_content": "A British woman has revealed she underwent an exorcism, claiming she did it to rid her home of evil spirits which were biting her and grabbing her wrists while she was in bed.\n\nMarried couple Emma and Ross could never have predicted the spiritual suffering their dream new-build home would have in store for them four years after moving into their four-bedroom house in the small Worcestershire village of Kempsey.\n\nBut their dream has turned into a nightmare, as the couple claim their home has become inhabited by prowling evil spirits who haunt and torment Emma on a daily basis.\n\nIn an episode of Help! My House is Haunted on discovery+, a distressed and worried Emma reached her wit's end, and turned to the team of Barri, Ian and Jayne in an attempt to overcome her experiences with the evil spirits that are ruining her life.\n\nIn harrowing footage the team are forced to perform an exorcism on Emma, which Barri declared was 'the most intense evening we've ever experienced'.\n\nEmma, from Worcestershire, who claimed evil spirits are biting her and grabbing her wrists when she tries to sleep got an exorcism to detach the entity\n\nEmma explained: 'I feel like I have no spiritual boundary, these things are just latching onto me. I was woken up and there were people walking through my wall. I don't sleep. Every time I try to go to sleep, they grab me around the wrist and I can feel their fingers.\n\n'I can feel them touching me. I can smell them. I've had some horrible things said to me. I've had someone biting me, that's really horrible. I could feel the lips, I could feel its tongue and the wetness of its mouth. And I can't do a thing, I'm stuck.'\n\nAs the team of paranormal investigators arrived at the property, psychic medium Ian immediately detected a dark aura present on the land.\n\nIan said: 'Guys, do you know whether anything horrifying happened on the land where we're going to? Because I've got a feeling it's got a dark history.\n\n'Without saying too much, this area has seen more than its fair share of bloodshed and death,' paranormal researcher Jayne replied.\n\nAs Barri and Jayne headed off to investigate the case, Ian went into the property to conduct a solo exploration.\n\n'Wow, this place has got some really weird energy going on, my head's booming. This is really weird.\n\n'It's a new house, but it's almost as if the land is tainted with blood or something like that. Now, I don't know whether that's having an impact on this house or it's charging it.'\n\nIn harrowing footage the team are forced to perform an exorcism on Emma, which Barri declared was 'the most intense evening we've ever experienced'\n\nShe became more distressed and shouted to the spirit, 'You have no power over me, this is my f****** house. Get out!'\n\nA distressed and worried Emma reached her wit's end, and turned to the team of Barri, Ian and Jayne in an attempt to overcome her experiences with the evil spirits that are ruining her life\n\nHeading out to the garden, Ian conducted a form of psychometry, feeling the ground for vibrations which allow him to read the footprint of what spirits have left behind.\n\nHe said: 'I can hear this really heavy metallic clashing and banging and screaming and shouting. It's almost as if a battle or something like that went on within this area, which will feed anything negative because that is dark.'\n\nAfter sensing the most spiritual activity in Emma's bedroom, Ian invited Emma to join him for a visualisation experiment.\n\n'Ian's going to lower Emma's consciousness to find out more about these entities that keep harassing her,' Barri explained.\n\nIn this state, Emma immediately saw the spirit figure she had initially warned the team about, who she calls 'shadow man'.\n\nEmma described to the team: 'He's laughing at me, he's laughing, saying ''you won't get rid of me''. He's showing me his teeth.'\n\nShe became more distressed and shouted to the spirit, 'You have no power over me, this is my f****** house. Get out!'\n\nAs he observed the stress that 'shadow man' is causing, Ian held up a crucifix above a blindfolded Emma to test whether 'this dark entity is repelled by religion.'\n\nDespite being blindfolded, Emma immediately put her arm in front of her. 'Emma can't see yet, she's got her hand up rejecting the crucifix.\n\nMarried couple Emma and Ross could never have predicted the spiritual suffering their dream new-build would have in store for them four years after moving into their four-bed home in the small Worcestershire village of Kempsey\n\nAfter sensing the most spiritual activity in Emma's bedroom, Ian invited Emma to join him for a visualisation experiment\n\nIn what Barri described as 'the most intense evening we've ever experienced', the team met with Emma and Ross the following morning to review their evidence and listen back to the correspondence they had had with the spirits\n\nThat means this entity is trying to resist me,' Ian explained before concluding, 'it's clear Emma is gifted, but she's also vulnerable. I need to keep this malevolent entity away with prayer.'\n\nAs Emma became more visibly distressed, Ian snapped her out of the sub-conscious state, with her husband Ross immediately on hand to comfort her.\n\nAfter seeing the pain and trouble that the visualisation experiment caused Emma, the team decide the best plan of action is to carry out their investigations overnight on their own.\n\nThey choose to deepen their understanding by directly communicating with the spirits, to work out who they are and what has attracted them specifically to Emma.\n\nDespite their tireless efforts throughout the night however, the team concluded that the evil spirit's attachment to Emma is so great that they won't be able to banish the entity without Emma being present and that Ian will need to perform an exorcism.\n\n'Exorcism is always a last resort, but in this case, it's the only way to detach the spirit and move it on,' Ian reluctantly explained.\n\nJayne agreed: 'This dark entity has clearly formed an attachment to Emma, and it sounds like it won't give her up easily, adding that 'the problem is, of course, now that there are two things that will feed that attachment, Emma's fear and Ross's anger. If it's been with her for a couple of years, it's getting stronger.'\n\nIn what is a chilling and terrifying watch, throughout the exorcism Emma is battling with the entity, screaming 'LEAVE ME ALONE! THIS IS MY BODY!'\n\nAs Ian attempted to drive the entity out, he recited passages from the bible and doused Emma in holy water to cleanse her.\n\nIn what was clearly a traumatising but necessary experience, an increasingly petrified Emma continually called out, 'someone's screaming in my head Ian', 'my body's shaking', 'help me please! I didn't ask for this!'\n\nThe exorcism process reached the stage where Ian explained that Emma will need the supportive strength of a loved one in the spirit world, so she called upon her grandad to help her fight the evil that lives within her.\n\nWith the help of her grandad, and after reciting The Lord's Prayer, Ian was finally able to repel the evil entity and complete the exorcism.\n\n'It was a really dark entity, it was actually a lot deeper than I thought,' Ian concluded as he gives Emma a St. Benedict's medal, which he said 'will protect her from this evil entity coming back.'\n\nIn what Barri described as 'the most intense evening we've ever experienced', the team met with Emma and Ross the following morning to review their evidence and listen back to the correspondence they had had with the spirits.\n\nEpisode 2 of the brand-new sixth series of Help!

        "article_content": "No matter whether it is the online variety, or those that take place on the phone, call centres can be infuriating. You might spend hours waiting in a queue to get through to an advisor, only for someone to hang up accidentally, or to be put on hold for more hours, rarely with the problem being solved. And that\u2019s without mentioning the hold music that is played.\n\nBut sometimes, as I am on hold, I think about the poor people who have to do this job. What must it be like with the abuse or hatred aimed at them? Surely it would be worse if your mortal soul was on the line? Welcome to the Home Safety Hotline.\n\nHome Safety Hotline \u2013 bonkers!\n\nHome Safety Hotline\u2019s story is one of the most bonkers I\u2019ve ever played, but it is most definitely one of the more positive elements of the game.\n\nYou play an unnamed worker who you never see or hear from. You start the game on a PC home screen, with some emails and thumbnails, including a welcome video from Home Safety Hotline where you are going to be working. Here you log in, clocking in to begin work. There\u2019s a first phone call from your supervisor with words of encouragement and corporate speech and then you begin your shift.\n\nWhat happens next focuses on those people who ring up, describing any problems found in their house. Some of these will come with descriptions like \u201cI can hear strange noises coming from the walls\u201d, and so you are left to try and work out what the problem is from a list of issues. Could it be mice? Or is it black mold? Or bats? You send the client the information about the possible pest or issue, and then wait for the next call.\n\nDare you answer the call?\n\nIt\u2019s when you start to get strange calls from distorted people that Home Safety Hotline starts taking a turn down a weird avenue. It\u2019s about then that the descriptions of problems become stranger, as the list of options you can choose from includes things like \u201cStair Slug\u201d, \u201cTroll\u201d or \u201cWine Sprite\u201d. At the end of the shift, you get an accuracy grade on how well you have dealt with the customer\u2019s descriptions, and the advice given. Get a low percentage and you are soon fired and there isn\u2019t a good ending for you. Do well and your supervisor will reward you, and everything will be revealed\u2026\n\nThe story is great, strange and hard to grasp, but it is something that will stay with you. The writing from the characters (customers) is good and the descriptions of all the entities the developers have created are fantastic. There are also strange videos you can watch in between shifts, like one about hiking that takes the darkest of turns, as well as a funny one about mice.\n\nIt plays easily too. The gameplay is very simple, very much a case of pressing A to answer the phone, putting them on hold, and selecting an option to match the customer\u2019s descriptions. It\u2019s a hard game though, and you have to really sit and listen, reading the description to get it right. However, going down the list of entities can be a long process, so much so that by day 5 of working there, I wished it could have been sped up a bit.\n\nGetting weird!\n\nVisually, Home Safety Hotline has a 90\u2019s PC design to it, one that is effective and works well. Little thumbnail pictures of the people who ring up appear and when some of these pictures are distorted and weirded-up, the design works brilliantly. There is some video work as well that I loved, complete with some B-movie feels to it; very much a perfect choice.\n\nSound wise, Home Safety Hotline comes with great voice work with all the customers fully voiced; again, slowly getting more bizarre and scary.\n\nStrange, unusual and a lot of fun, Home Safety Hotline is like David Lynch meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The actual gameplay loop is highly original and it\u2019s enjoyable to try and work out the right choices from the descriptions given. It\u2019s not going to be for everyone, but those who love their games on the weird side will want to start a shift with Home Safety Hotline immediately.\n\nBuy Home Safety Hotline on Xbox \u2013 https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/home-safety-hotline/9p9nx35p7vnx\n\nFrom Pests to the Paranormal: Home Safety Hotline Now Available on Consoles \u2013 https://www.thexboxhub.com/from-pests-to-the-paranormal-home-safety-hotline-now-available-on-consoles/"

        "article_content": "Although penicillin was discovered on September 28, 1928 by Andrew Fleming, a British physician and professor of bacteriology at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in London, it took fourteen years for the first civilian patient to receive treatment. Such a long delay to deliver what Popular Science called one of 1943\u2019s top ten \u201ctriumphs in medicine\u201d of all time seems unconscionable. In the decades since, it has been estimated that penicillin has saved more than 500 million lives. But word of Fleming\u2019s discovery was slow to spread, the therapeutic implications weren\u2019t entirely clear, and penicillin turned out to be quite difficult to manufacture.\n\nFleming, who admittedly discovered penicillin by chance, is reported to have said, \u201cWhen I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn\u2019t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world\u2019s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I guess that was exactly what I did.\u201d\n\nHe had been conducting experiments with common staphylococcal bacteria, or staph, but left an uncovered petri dish by an open window during a vacation in Scotland. When he returned, the dish looked different. It had the usual clusters of bacterial colonies, except for one spot covered in mold. \u201cIn the broth,\u201d Fleming later wrote, \u201cthe mould grows on the surface as a white fluffy growth changing in a few days to a dark green felted mass.\u201d Around the \u201cfelted mass\u201d the broth was clear\u2014nearby bacterial colonies seemed to have been killed by mold secretions.\n\nFleming continued to experiment with what he called \u201cmold juice,\u201d eventually isolating the Penicillium fungus as the bacteria slayer. He published his findings in 1929 in the British Journal of Pathology with only passing reference to the ramifications penicillin might have to treat patients suffering from serious infections such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, gonorrhea, or meningitis. Fleming seemed more focused on its implications for helping scientists who study bacteria. \u201cIn addition to its possible use in the treatment of bacterial infections,\u201d he wrote, \u201cpenicillin is certainly useful to the bacteriologist for its power of inhibiting unwanted microbes in bacterial cultures so that penicillin insensitive bacteria can be readily isolated.\u201d\n\nA decade after Fleming published his work, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and others at Oxford University sought ways to manufacture penicillin at scale, which meant cultivating massive quantities of Penicillium. But they struggled to grow enough mold. Their production was so scant, in fact, that they ran out of penicillin while treating their first patient, Albert Alexander, in 1941. Without the medication, Alexander, who had been improving, ultimately died. It wasn\u2019t until Florey recruited help from the US Department of Agriculture and US-based pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Lilly, and Merck that mass production began in earnest.\n\nWhen, in 1943, Popular Science named penicillin as one of the top ten medicines in history, the contributing writer and physician, Iago Galdston, cited its superior infection-fighting performance when compared with the leading antibacterial treatment, sulfa drugs: \u201cPenicillin operates, as the sulfonamides do not, in the presence of pus and tissue fluids.\u201d Until then, no drugs existed that could fight \u201clong-established infections,\u201d which, as Galdston wrote, made penicillin particularly valuable. But even in 1943, penicillin was hard to come by. Galdston lamented, \u201cUnfortunately we cannot as yet produce penicillin in large quantities, and what is being produced has been preempted by the Government for military use.\u201d At the time, a single dose of penicillin cost $20 ($364 in 2024). By the time World War II ended in 1945, a dose of penicillin cost $.55 ($10 today) and was readily available in the US.\n\nLooking back, Popular Science\u2019s 1943 Top Ten List seems particularly prescient. In addition to penicillin, the new and emerging treatments that Galdston cited included vitamins and the importance of nutrition, hormone therapy to treat cancer and other disorders, and psychosomatic treatment, or the growing awareness that psychiatric disorders could manifest in physical symptoms and vice versa. Despite such medical blockbusters, it may be Galdston\u2019s final item that has had the most profound effect on medicine: \u201cBiological Thinking.\u201d Galdston defined biological thinking as an acknowledgment that \u201cthe basis of well-being lies in achieving the best possible adjustment between the individual and his physical and emotional environment.\u201d Today, we take for granted that excess stress from factors such as jobs, relationships, and finances, can make us sick, but in 1943 the idea was novel.\n\nPenicillin remains one of the most widely prescribed antibiotics. And producing penicillin still requires growing mold, but pharmaceutical companies have perfected the manufacturing process, growing Penicillium in deep fermentation tanks not unlike those used in breweries. But these tanks produce something even more valuable than beer\u2014Fleming\u2019s \u201cmold juice.\u201d\n\nPopular Science, December 1943:\n\nTen New Triumphs in Medicine\n\nMAGIC DRUGS, INGENIOUS INSTRUMENTS, WIDER KNOWLEDGE MARK THE RAPID ADVANCEMENT OF THE LAST THREE DECADES\n\nBy IAGO GALDSTON, M. D. Author of \u201cProgress in Medicine\u201d and \u201cBehind the Sulfa Drugs\u201d\n\nWithin the short span of the past 30 discoveries have developed in the field of medicine than in any comparable period during the entire history of the science. In times past, important discoveries often were followed by long periods of little or no progressive medical thinking. Today, discoveries of the utmost importance are following quickly on each other\u2019s heels.\n\nAmong these inventions and discoveries is an instrument with a moving pen, which can \u201ctake dictation\u201d from a patient\u2019s brain. The record of electrical brain waves that this amazing secretary takes down is read by the surgeon for indications of brain disorders. Another is a drug so powerful that one part in 25 million parts of water will stop the growth of bacteria. Still another has revolutionized the science of diagnosis, and has completely recast the modern physician\u2019s approach to the problem of healing.\n\nIn this writer\u2019s judgment, 10 of the greatest medical discoveries and inventions of recent years are: The sulfonamides; penicillin; the vitamins; the sex hormones; the relation of the sex hormones to cancer; the electro-encephalograph; the electron microscope; psychosomatic medicine; brief therapy; and biological thinking.\n\nThe Sulfonamides\n\nThe sulfonamides are without doubt the best known of the recent medical discoveries. And justly so, for no single group of com- pounds has proved as effective as this one in preventing and treating such a large number of diseases. Pneumonia, gonorrhea, erysipelas, childbed fever, many forms of bloodstream infection, trachoma, septic sore throat, urinary infections, meningococcus meningitis, chancroid, gas gangrene, actinomycosis, anthrax, scarlet fever, impetigo -these are but some of the conditions effectively treated with one or another of the sulfonamide compounds.\n\nEqually remarkable and numerous are the applications of the sulfonamides in the prevention of infection. Since their first use in this respect, the lives of countless men wounded in battle have been saved. The sulfonamides have also extended the scope of surgery, heretofore limited by the threat of infection supervening upon operations in contaminated regions. They are reducing the incidence of serious complications which in times past frequently followed on simple infections. There is, however, one particular aspect of the discovery of the sulfonamides which overshadows even its great practical results. The sulfonamides have given new life to the science of chemotherapy-the treatment of internal disease with chemicals. Chemotherapy got off to a great start when Paul Ehrlich discovered Salvarsan in 910 although for the next 25 years little new appeared on the chemotherapeutic scene. Then in 1935 came Prontosil, and later the sulfonamides, and the whole picture changed. But what changed most was the concept of chemotherapy itself. Paul Ehrlich and practically all of his followers thought of chemotherapy in terms of \u201cmagic bullets,\u201d that is, in terms of protoplasmic poisons which would kill germs, but not the human body. Unfortunately few such selective poisons were found. Most of the protoplasmic poisons proved as likely to injure the victim as the at- tacking germs. Then when Prontosil and the sulfonamides were found to be so amazingly effective against bacteria, the old theories of chemotherapy had to be recast, for the sulfonamides do not belong to the class of protoplasmic poisons. In fact, the sulfonamides are not even bactericidal, that is, they do not directly kill germs. They are, however, bacteriostatic: they arrest the development of germs by interfering with their metabolism. By thus weakening the germs, they make it possible for them to be overcome by the body\u2019s own defenses.\n\nToday, research follows the path of germ metabolism, and seeks to discover how that metabolism may be adversely affected by means of chemical agents. It is this new rational basis for chemotherapy that warrants our hope of finding chemicals with which to cure tuberculosis, leprosy, malaria, and other germ and virus diseases not affected by the sulfonamides.\n\nPenicillin\n\nHot on the heels of the sulfonamides came the discovery of penicillin, a chemotherapeutic agent in many respects superior to the sul- fonamides. This powerful new drug is derived from a fungus called Penicillium notatum. In 1929, this fungus, or mold, was an unwelcome in- truder into some staphylococcus cultures with which the English bacteriologist Prof. A. Fleming had been experimenting for quite some time. Fleming acutely observed then that wherever the fungus grew, the germs did not, and he reasoned that the fungus and the germs did not get along well together. He studied the matter further and found his reasoning correct.\n\nHowever, since the fungus was not antagonistic to all germs, but only to certain ones, he employed it to eliminate from groups of mixed germs those to which penicillin was antagonistic. But that was as far as the matter went at the time.\n\nWith the discovery of the sulfonamides it was natural for the scientists to turn their attention once again to the penicillium mold. Another English scientist, Prof. H. W. Florey, in 1940 extracted from the penicillium mold a brown powder-like substance. He found it to be an extraordinarily powerful drug, effective against a larger variety of infections than are the sulfonamides.\n\nThough but recently discovered, penicillin has already been subjected to numerous trials. Unlike the sulfonamides, which operate by diminishing the growth of bacteria, it has been found to kill bacteria or stop their growth entirely. But it will work in many cases where the sulfa drugs have proved useless or only partially effective. Penicillin operates, as the sulfonamides do not, in the presence of pus and tissue fluids. This renders it particularly valuable in the treatment of such conditions as osteomyelitis, empyema, infected compound fractures, and wounds and burns with long-established infections. Penicillin is superior in undermining the yellow pus-producing bacteria, the staphylococcus aureus, and many infections caused by cocci. And the user of penicillin suffers no toxic effects such as are sometimes experienced when sulfa drugs have been employed.\n\nUnfortunately we cannot as yet produce penicillin in large quantities, and what is being produced has been preempted by the Government for military use. There is, however, no reason to doubt that the chemists will before long succeed in crystallizing it and reproducing it artificially.\n\nThe Vitamins\n\nThe vitamins represent a major medical discovery of an order different from any of those thus far described. Biology and medicine have been radically affected by their discovery. Until vitamins were discovered, the conviction prevailed among medical men that there wasn\u2019t much one could do about health except to prevent disease. Doctors preached personal hygiene in terms of rest, cleanliness, exercise, fresh air, and good food. But they did so in the belief that they could only preserve health, which for any given individual was more or less fixed. For the rest, attention was focused on \u201cfighting infection\u201d by such means as vaccines, serums, antiseptics, and so forth.\n\nWith the development of the modern science of nutrition, of which the vitamins are an important segment, we learned that one could be not sick, but at the same time not healthy, as in the case of \u201csubclinical conditions,\u201d in which the patient is not manifestly ill, but also is far from well. We also discovered that susceptibility to many types of disease, including infections, was due to malnutrition, and that growth, de- velopment, and aging were profoundly influenced by the quantity and quality of the foods eaten.\n\nAs our knowledge of nutrition increases, and as that knowledge is applied to the everyday diet of people, we are bound to see a reduction in the incidence of disease, and an improvement in physical growth and wellbeing.\n\nThe Sex Hormones\n\nThe discovery of the sex hormones is one of the achievements of modern medicine on which the public is comparatively unin- formed. Yet it is truly a tremendous accomplishment.\n\nIt was a bright hunch that led to the discovery of the female sex hormone. When an ovum (egg) ripens in the ovary, it is surrounded by a minute quantity of a yellowish fluid, known as the liquor folliculi. No one thought to investigate the function of that fluid until 1922, when Edgar Allen, Ph.D., of St. Louis, and his wife obtained buckets of ovaries from a meat-packing plant and, working on their kitchen table, carefully drew off the fluid from the follicles. Soon they had enough of it to enable their coworker, Dr. E. A. Doisy, to purify it and determine its chemical constitution. This made possible the crystallization of the female hormone in 1929. In 1936 it was reproduced artificially. The discovery of the male hormone, which is credited to L. C. McGee, of Chicago, took place in 1927.\n\nThe sex hormones have proved enormously useful in the treatment of a variety of disturbances, including those of the sexual and reproductive functions. From this discovery was derived the original Aschheim-Zondek test for pregnancy.\n\nThe most important result of the discovery of sex hormones, however, is the light it has thrown upon the complicated structures and operations of the glands of internal secretion. These glands affect growth, development, metabolism, sexual function, reproduction; in fact, all phases of the \u201cinner activities\u201d of the human body.\n\nThe Relation of the Sex Hormones to Cancer\n\nCancer of the prostate is one of the most common types of malignancy affecting men. This type of cancer is difficult to discover in its early stages, and tends to spread so work of uniformly close tolerances is performed rapidly that, in actual experience, less than five percent of such cases can be successfully treated surgically.\n\nIn 1941, Dr. C. Huggins, of the University of Chicago, advanced the idea that the prostate cancer cells require the male hormone for their continued existence, even as the normal prostate cells do. He and his associates reasoned from this that castration or else the \u201cneutralization\u201d of the male hormone by means of the female hormone should adversely affect the prostate cancer growths. He, and others after him, tried the latter treatment. The results were astonishing. Although the cancer is not cured, most of the patients benefit enormously. Pain disappears, nutrition improves, appetite returns, and strength is regained. The original cancer growth in the prostate, and those that have spread to other parts of the body, regress so that many sufferers are enabled to carry on their normal activities in comfort. This treatment of prostatic cancer is vastly superior to any previously available. But the greatest value of the discovery is that it has stimulated many scientists to study the relation of the sex hormones to cancer in general.\n\nThe Electro-Encephalograph\n\nThis recent invention is a sleuthing machine for tracking down the mysterious ways of the brain. Working by means of vacuum tubes similar to those used in a radio, it picks up \u201cbrain waves\u201d-electrical impulses generated in the head by brain function. These currents, which have distinguishing characteristics, are visibly recorded by a moving pen. Since a brain suffering from some organic ailment sends out waves differing from those generated by a normal one, the record set down by the electro-encephalograph can be read by the brain surgeon for indications of such dis- orders as brain tumors and epilepsy. This useful diagnostic instrument promises to be of great value in the study of the physiology of the nervous system, and of the dynamics of drugs employed for their effects on the nervous system.\n\nThe Electron Microscope\n\nThe electron microscope likewise promises to prove a great research instrument. The ordinary microscope cannot magnify an object beyond approximately 2,000 diameters, this limitation being imposed by the wavelength of light. The electron microscope, however, can magnify objects from 50,000 to a 100,000 diameters. It can, therefore, be readily seen how this extremely powerful instrument has opened up new and vast fields of research in bacteriology and biochemistry. We are now able to obtain a really intimate insight into the structure of both living and nonliving matter, and, most interestingly, of that \u201cin-between\u201d matter known as the viruses, which are responsible for such destructive diseases as smallpox, influenza, and infantile paralysis.\n\nPsychosomatic Medicine\n\nOne of the more interesting developments of psychiatry goes by the name of psychosomatic medicine. It represents the fusion of orthodox clinical medicine with the best in psychiatric knowledge. It teaches the important lesson, in an irrefutable way, that there is no disorder of the soma (the body) without some involvement of the psyche (the mind and the emotions), and conversely, that psychiatric disorders have their somatic (physical) components. In some instances, indeed, physical symptoms are the only tangible manifestations of what is primarily a psychiatric condition. This insight into the interplay of psyche and soma has made possible a much more effective treatment of many conditions which in times past could be treated only superficially. It also enables the physician to anticipate, and by appropriate action to prevent, the development of a variety of physical and emotional strains and disorders.\n\nBrief Therapy\n\nRelated to psychiatry is the new experimental development of brief therapy. The objective of these experiments is, simply, brevity of treatment. Most of the techniques of psychiatric therapy as practiced today are lengthy and therefore costly. Far too many persons who require treatment cannot afford it. And there are not enough trained psychiatrists available to meet the needs. To correct these deficiencies, studies, conferences, and experiments are being conducted to develop techniques of psychotherapy that will be effective but less time-consuming.\n\nBiological Thinking\n\nFinally we come to that development in present-day medicine which blankets all others: the ability to think biologically. Today the physician thinks of his patient in terms of his many environmental relationships\u2013his job, his marriage, his friends, his education, his degree of success, and so forth. A short while ago, however, the physician thought of his patient only in terms of his complaints, of the symptoms or disorders he discovered and of the specific remedies he could use in the treatment of \u201cthe case.\u201d In fact, the physician was more concerned with the \u201ccase\u201d-with the disease afflicting the patient-than with the patient himself.\n\nToday, we know that to effect a permanent cure, the contributory as well as the primary factors must be considered and dealt with; that, in substance, the basis of well-being lies in achieving the best possible adjustment between the individual and his physical and emotional environment."

        "article_content": "This story was updated to add a photo.\n\nORLANDO, Fla. \u2013 Travis Hunter wore custom-made football cleats in Saturday night\u2019s game against Central Florida \u2013 a pair of gold-colored shoes with a graphic on them depicting the mountains and trees of Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThey had quite a night. First he scored a 23-yard touchdown in them in the first quarter. Then he made an interception and flashed the Heisman Trophy pose in them in the third quarter. After his Colorado team won the game, 48-21, Colorado\u2019s two-way superstar even took those cleats off his feet and gave them to somebody in the stands here at FBC Mortgage Stadium.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who he is, man,\u201d Colorado football coach Deion Sanders said of Hunter\u2019s big night.\n\nBy the time it was over, Hunter had caught nine passes for 89 yards and a touchdown, snagged one interception, broke up one other opposing pass attempt and recorded two tackles before walking back to the locker room in his socks.\n\nMr. Everywhere had done it again.\n\nBut this time was different.\n\nWhy was this win different for Travis Hunter and Deion Sanders?\n\nHunter\u2019s team also rose to the occasion around him to play what might be its best all-around game in Sanders\u2019 two seasons as head coach.\n\nIt also came on a homecoming of sorts for both Sanders and Hunter, both Florida natives coming home to lead the Buffaloes (4-1) to their third straight win.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how emotional I am about these young men and seeing what they could do when they put it all together and seeing what we\u2019re capable of when we put it all together,\u201d Sanders said afterward.\n\nThe win effectively puts the Big 12 Conference on notice. The Buffs are hot, on the move and might even come close to cracking the national Top 25. The Buffs led 27-14 at halftime and held the nation\u2019s No. 1 rushing offense to 177 rushing yards, nearly 200 under UCF\u2019s season average before Saturday.\n\nHere\u2019s how they did it Saturday and what it means:\n\nWhat did Deion Sanders say about win?\n\nHe was in a playful mood after a warm, humid game that started about 50 minutes late because of lightning in the area. He poked fun of Hunter, who is known to wear onesie pajamas and doesn\u2019t always like talking to the news media after games.\n\n\u201cKnowing Travis, he ain\u2019t coming,\u201d Sanders said at the postgame news conference. \u201cHe\u2019s probably on the bus with a onesie on.\u201d\n\nSanders also poked fun of his quarterback son Shedeur, who threw an interception on the game\u2019s opening drive before leading the Buffs on scoring drives in six of their next seven possessions in front of an announced sellout crowd of 45,702 at FBC Mortgage Stadium. Shedeur Sanders completed 28 of 35 passes for 290 yards and three touchdowns. He added three carries for 28 yards and was only sacked twice despite the loss of a starting guard to injury this week.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon Grown, they want to ask you about the interception,\u201d Deion Sanders said to his son as the quarterback entered the post-game news conference.\n\nThat\u2019s what Sanders calls Shedeur: \u201cGrown\u201d \u2013 as in mature beyond his years.\n\nShedeur Sanders showed it by settling down after the initial turnover and letting his running game take some pressure off of him for a change. The Buffs compiled 128 rushing yards on 29 carries, led by 39 from running back Isaiah Augustave, a native of Naples, Florida.\n\n\u201cWe got outcoached,\u201d UCF head coach Gus Malzahn said. \u201cWe got outplayed.\u201d\n\nUCF gave up two interceptions and two fumbles to Colorado, including one that was returned 95 yards by safety Cam\u2019Ron Silmon-Craig for the final touchdown of the game in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhat did Shedeur Sanders say afterward?\n\nHe was asked how he stays focused amid the hype and all the football legends that come to see him and his father at games. On Saturday, Cam Newton, the 2010 Heisman Trophy winner, greeted him before the game. Hall of Fame receivers Michael Irvin and Terrell Owens watched him from the Colorado sideline, too.\n\nSo how does he do it? Shedeur Sanders answered by saying he collects personal slights, either real or imagined. He said he remembers being described as \u201cjust an HBCU kid who couldn\u2019t do it at the Power 5 level,\u201d referring to Jackson State, a historically Black college where he played in 2022 before transferring to Colorado last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t forget anything,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t forget what anybody ever said, and personally I\u2019m not one to make friends or feel like just because success is going on, now I\u2019m going to forgive everybody. Nah, whatever you said at any point in time, I\u2019m not really a forgiving type.\u201d\n\nThat kind of mindset drove him to dominate a team Saturday that was favored by two touchdowns. He spread the ball around to eight different receivers and knocked the Knights (3-1) out of their comfort zone by forcing them to pass the ball more to keep up.\n\n\u201cTo keep up with our type of scoring, that gets them out of their comfort zone and provokes them to throw the ball a little more than they\u2019d like to,\u201d Deion Sanders said.\n\nHis team now gets some rest heading into a bye weekend in Boulder. The Buffs resume play at home on Oct. 12 against Kansas State.\n\nDeion Sanders talks about his record\n\nSanders pulled a trick on the news media afterward to make a point. With four wins, his team now has matched its win total from last year, when the Buffs finished 4-8 in his first season in Boulder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so darn proud of where we are,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe could be in a whole different place right now, but look it\u2026 We\u2019re going into the break. What\u2019s the record?\u201d\n\n\u201cFour-and-one,\u201d the news media responded.\n\n\u201cSay it again,\u201d Sanders said, acting like he couldn\u2019t hear.\n\n\u201cFour-and-one,\u201d the room said again.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to hear y\u2019all say it collectively, and y\u2019all fell for it,\u201d Sanders said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 4-1 going into the break, and I\u2019m so excited, you have no idea,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a really good plane ride tonight.\u201d\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.
