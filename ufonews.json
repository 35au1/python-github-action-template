        "article_content": "When you think of a game development team releasing a collection of 50 games, most people tend to think they are mini-games or micro-games. That means short and simple games that wouldn\u2019t take long to create the collection. However, that is not the case with UFO 50. This anthology of pure nostalgia in metafiction and retro-gaming released this September was created by Derek Yu, An American Indie game developer known for his popular title Spelunky.\n\nDerek Yu came up with the idea of creating a collection of 1980s-style arcade games to be packaged in a single release and enlisted the help of several Indie developers to bring it to life. Yu also created the story of a fictional gaming studio known as UFO Soft, whose development history is chronicled in his collection. Every game in the collection is unique, but the ongoing company narrative is conveyed through recurring themes, characters, and several sequels.\n\nWhen you open UFO 50, you are presented with a straightforward interface that you would expect from a casino operator like Betway, with 50 icons leading to different titles. The developers span every genre you can imagine existing in arcades in the 1980s, ranging from shooter to fighter, strategy, and stealth. However, these are not mini-games as every title has a uniquely crafted storyline and progression that\u2019s beautifully packaged with a catchy soundtrack and visuals.\n\nRetro game enthusiasts who enjoy the thrill of online casinos will see familiar mechanics in titles like Gradius, Bubble Bobble, and Streets of Rage. Much like the unpredictable outcomes in games on Betway Zambia, these classic games incorporate unexpected twists to enhance the player\u2019s experience. For example, in Caramel Caramel, players merge traditional spaceship shooting with elements of strategy, reminiscent of placing tactical bets. Similarly, the innovative gameplay of Mortal, where players use their character\u2019s demise strategically to progress, mirrors the risk and reward dynamics found in online casino games, offering a blend of nostalgia and modern gaming challenges.\n\nWith challenging levels and little assistance, every game throws you into the thick of things and lets you work out a solution. That acts as a reminder that in the early days when there were no YouTube guides or tutorials, games were full of mysterious things.\n\nWhile most of these games have NES-era aesthetics, most are in dialogue with the trends and tropes of classic gaming like the Metroidvania progression system in the title Porgy. There are also several interesting curveballs like the Night Manor, which is a genuinely scary point-and-click horror game. If you still don\u2019t know which titles to play, it will only take a few seconds to jump from one game to the other.\n\nAs a package, UFO 50 shows how rapidly technology has advanced since the 1980s, starting with the frustratingly clunky game of Barbuta to the sophisticated last game Cyber Owls which combines four different genres. All these games feel generally simple by the current industry standards and there\u2019s excitement in the sense of focus that technical limitations create along with the willingness to experiment. The result is a riotous anthology of pure nostalgia that reminds players of what they might have forgotten in the wake of gaming tech innovations.\n\nSee also: The evolution of gaming chairs: from basic to high-tech"

        "article_content": "Taylor Community Library will host a talk by renowned UFO researcher and author Raymond Szymanski on Oct. 16. As an acclaimed expert in UFO investigations, Szymanski will share experiences with his deep dives into extraterrestrial phenomena, bolstered by his 40-year career at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB).\n\nHis talk, \u201cNot \u2018Swamp Gas\u2019: The True Story of the 1966 Michigan UFOs,\u201d will offer Szymanski\u2019s perspective on one of the most significant UFO waves in American history\u2014the 1966 Dexter-Hillsdale sightings.\n\nSzymanski\u2019s journey into UFO research began at WPAFB, a base infamous for its alleged connection to extraterrestrial activity, including the 1947 Roswell incident.\n\n\u201cIn my first week there in 1973, as a co-op student, my mentor asked me, \u2018Have you heard about our aliens?\u2019 That\u2019s when I thought, \u2018Whoa, what kind of special place did I land in?\u2019\u201d Szymanski said. His initial exposure to rumors of alien connections at WPAFB sparked a lifelong passion for uncovering the truth.\n\nOver his four decades at WPAFB, Szymanski honed his investigative skills and built a network of colleagues that granted him rare access to information related to UFO activity.\n\n\u201cYou gain a lot of confidence over years of working, and the network gives you an instant pass,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all the information I had gleaned while working there, I started doing some serious field research. I didn\u2019t care if I found evidence for or against it\u2014I just wanted to find the truth.\u201d\n\nThis meticulous, logical approach laid the foundation for his books, including \u201cFifty Shades of Greys,\u201d \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret Truth,\u201d and \u201cSwamp Gas My Ass.\u201d\n\nThe Dexter UFO Incident of 1966\n\nSzymanski\u2019s upcoming talk at Taylor Community Library will focus on the Dexter UFO sightings of March 20, 1966, an event that left an indelible mark on southeastern Michigan. UFO sightings surged across the region during this period, and the Dexter-Hillsdale incidents were among the most widely reported. Police officers, residents, and even military personnel filed official reports describing flying saucers with capabilities far beyond earthly technology.\n\nSzymanski will explore these events in detail, offering new insights based on his research for his book Swamp Gas My Ass. One of the critical elements of this investigation involves first-hand accounts from witnesses like Connie Bell, who encountered a UFO near Peach Mountain. Szymanski recorded her testimony, where she described seeing a craft with flashing red and white lights\u2014an encounter that has only been shared once publicly. Szymanski will share the audio testimony during his library talk.\n\nHe said the Dexter case was particularly significant because of the credibility of the witnesses.\n\n\u201cBefore the night was over, 12 police officers were running through the property, chasing these lights,\u201d Szymanski said, adding that in a different sighting that night, a patrolman observed an object hovering over his car for 10 to 15 minutes, joined by three other objects before they all disappeared together. The consistency of these accounts adds weight to the mystery, and Szymanski aims to shed light on how authorities systematically minimized such reports at the time.\n\nWright-Patterson\u2019s alien lore\n\nWright-Patterson Air Force Base has long been rumored to be a focal point for alien research, particularly in connection with the 1947 Roswell crash.\n\n\u201cAliens who supposedly crashed near Roswell, along with their ship, have been said to be stored in a Wright-Patt hangar,\u201d Szymanski said. \u201cOver the years, stories about secret projects like Project Blue Book, a government investigation into UFO sightings, have fueled speculation that WPAFB harbors the remains of extraterrestrial craft and even bodies.\u201d\n\nSzymanski\u2019s experience at WPAFB allowed him to conduct direct field research to investigate the truth behind these rumors.\n\nHe said the recent shift in governmental attitudes toward UFOs, marked by the June 2021 release of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s UAP report, has further validated his decades of research. Szymanski views this document as one of the most important developments in UFO history.\n\n\u201cIt confirmed three key things: these are real physical objects, they present a flight hazard, and they are potentially a national security issue,\u201d he said.\n\nA future of ongoing exploration\n\nAs UFO sightings continue to rise globally and the possibility of extraterrestrial life becomes more accepted, Szymanski remains at the forefront of UFO research. The UFO phenomenon, once relegated to the fringes of science, is now gaining mainstream recognition, with individuals from all walks of life eager to share their experiences.\n\n\u201cPeople want to tell their stories,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the stigma of reporting sightings lessens, non-stop, people are coming forward more and more, saying, \u2018I know I\u2019m not crazy.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn addition to his UFO investigations, Szymanski is also working on other projects, including a book on metal detecting and possibly publishing hundreds of stories shared by everyday citizens about their UFO encounters. His presentation at Taylor Public Library offers a rare opportunity to hear directly from one of the most knowledgeable experts on UFO activity in the United States.\n\nEvent details\n\nRaymond Szymanski\u2019s presentation, titled Not Swamp Gas: The True Story of the 1966 Michigan UFOs, will take place on Oct.16 at 6 p.m. at the Taylor Community Library, located at 12303 Pardee Rd, Taylor. The event is free, but registration is required. Szymanski will also hold a book signing after the talk, offering autographed copies of his Alien Shades of Greys trilogy.

        "article_content": "Scouted selects products independently. If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission.\n\nMy Foreo lore runs deep. Aside from a version of the now defunct (yet iconic) Clarisonic, the OG Foreo Luna Play was my bathtub bestie in the mid-2010s. Everyone wanted either the regular size or the miniature Luna Go. This and the aforementioned Clarisonic were my first forays into exfoliation tools. What did we really know about skincare at the time? All I knew was that I had a $100+ product gliding across my skin, and I felt elite.\n\nFast forward to 2024\u2014while Clarisonic didn\u2019t stand the test of time (#RIP), Foreo has gone on to do great things. The brand is still thriving at Sephora and Nordstrom, and as a leader in beauty tech, it continues living up to its innovative origins.\n\nI\u2019d been out of my Foreo game for a minute, but when I learned the Swedish brand launched a portable, deep facial hydration tool that labeled itself as \u201can iron for your wrinkles,\u201d I knew I had to get my hands on it. I\u2019ve tried (and loved) the Dr. Dennis Gross DRx SpectraLite FaceWare Pro, but hydration, specifically, is something I\u2019m always chasing. Naturally, Foreo\u2019s UFO 3 Deep Facial LED Hydration Treatment spoke to me.\n\nForeo UFO 3 Deep Facial Hydration Anti-Aging Device\n\nI\u2019ll admit, I get a bit freaked out by techy things. Anything that calls for an app download has me running for the hills. But I was intrigued by the compact size of this product, and was really taken by its promises. It claims to increase skin moisture by 126 percent in just two minutes, with greater efficacy than a sheet mask. It also says it\u2019s clinically proven to reduce the look of wrinkles in just one week. With that, I snagged myself the smart tool stat.\n\nBuy Foreo UFO 3 Deep Facial Hydration Anti-Aging Device at Foreo, $359\n\nBuy Foreo UFO 3 Deep Facial Hydration Anti-Aging Device at Revolve, $359\n\nAt $359, this bad boy comes with four unique mask types (H2Overdose Mask, Youth Junkie Mask, Manuka Honey Mask and Acai Berry Mask), and six masks per selection. Don\u2019t be fooled by the high-tech design. It\u2019s so easy to use. I downloaded the app, selected my user-friendly settings, and then began using the H2Overdose mask. I attached it to the device (as seen HERE in this video), and voila. It cuts down the time you\u2019d wear a traditional sheet mask by at least 15 minutes, and it doesn\u2019t require you to leave something balancing on your face. All I did was glide the tool along my face for a couple of minutes\u2014and with no pain or discomfort, my skin felt instantly moisturized.\n\nIt also features heating and massage options, along with LED light therapy. The biggest draws for me, in addition to spotting immediate results, are the travel-size convenience and user-friendly instruction. Consider the multifaceted tool easy enough for a beginner to enjoy, but advanced enough for an experienced skin tool user to embrace. If you think this is wild, the brand also just launched a 2-in-1 LED Scalp Massager. Does this mean I have to toss my beloved Vegamour GRO Revitalizing Scalp Massager?\n\nWith all this innovation, my 2013 self will just hope and wait for Clarisonic to make a comeback!\n\nMORE FROM SCOUTED:\n\nErase Eye Bags Instantly With This Lymphatic Drainage-Boosting Massager\n\nHere\u2019s How I Got My Sculpted Jawline Back Without Surgery\n\nThe LUNA 3 Facial Cleaning Brush Can Now Help Fight The Signs of Aging \u2014 And It\u2019s on Amazon Right Now\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

        "date": "1h",
        "source": "VentureBeat",
        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nHugging Face has released an innovative new Python package that allows developers to create AI-powered web apps with just a few lines of code.\n\nThe tool, called \u201cOpenAI-Gradio,\u201d simplifies the process of integrating OpenAI\u2019s large language models (LLMs) into web applications, making AI more accessible to developers of all skill levels.\n\nThe release signals a major shift in how companies can leverage AI, reducing development time while maintaining powerful, scalable applications.\n\nHow developers can create web apps in minutes with OpenAI-Gradio\n\nThe OpenAI-Gradio package integrates OpenAI\u2019s API with Gradio, a popular interface tool for machine learning (ML) applications.\n\nIn just a few steps, developers can install the package, set their OpenAI API key, and launch a fully functional web app.\n\nThe simplicity of this setup allows even smaller teams with limited resources to deploy advanced AI models quickly.\n\nFor instance, after installing the package with:\n\npip install openai-gradio\n\nA developer can write:\n\nimport gradio as gr import openai_gradio gr.load( name='gpt-4-turbo', src=openai_gradio.registry, ).launch()\n\nThis small amount of code spins up a Gradio interface connected to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4-turbo model, allowing users to interact with state-of-the-art AI directly from a web app.\n\nDevelopers can also customize the interface further, adding specific input and output configurations or even embedding the app into larger projects.\n\nSimplifying AI development for businesses of all sizes\n\nHugging Face\u2019s openai-gradio package removes traditional barriers to AI development, such as managing complex backend infrastructure or dealing with model hosting.\n\nBy abstracting these challenges, the package enables businesses of all sizes to build and deploy AI-powered applications without needing large engineering teams or significant cloud infrastructure.\n\nThis shift makes AI development more accessible to a much wider range of businesses. Small and mid-sized companies, startups, and online retailers can now quickly experiment with AI-powered tools, like automated customer service systems or personalized product recommendations, without the need for complex infrastructure.\n\nWith these new tools, companies can create and launch AI projects in days instead of months.\n\nWith Hugging Face\u2019s new openai-gradio tool, developers can quickly create interactive web apps, like this one powered by the GPT-4-turbo model, allowing users to ask questions and receive AI-generated responses in real-time. (Credit: Hugging Face / Gradio)\n\nCustomizing AI interfaces with just a few lines of code\n\nOne of the standout features of openai-gradio is how easily developers can customize the interface for specific applications.\n\nBy adding a few more lines of code, they can adjust everything from the input fields to the output format, tailoring the app for tasks such as answering customer queries or generating reports.\n\nFor example, developers can modify the interface to include specific prompts and responses, adjusting everything from the input method to the format of the output.\n\nThis could involve creating a chatbot that handles customer service questions or a data analysis tool that generates insights based on user inputs.\n\nHere\u2019s an example provided by Gradio:\n\ngr.load( name='gpt-4-turbo', src=openai_gradio.registry, title='OpenAI-Gradio Integration', description=\"Chat with GPT-4-turbo model.\", examples=[\"Explain quantum gravity to a 5-year-old.\", \"How many R's are in the word Strawberry?\"] ).launch()\n\nThe flexibility of the tool allows for seamless integration into broader web-based projects or standalone applications.\n\nThe package also integrates seamlessly into larger Gradio Web UIs, enabling the use of multiple models in a single application.\n\nWhy this matters: Hugging Face\u2019s growing influence in AI development\n\nHugging Face\u2019s latest release positions the company as a key player in the AI infrastructure space. By making it easier to integrate OpenAI\u2019s models into real-world applications, Hugging Face is pushing the boundaries of what developers can achieve with minimal resources.\n\nThis move also signals a broader trend toward AI-first development, where companies can iterate more quickly and deploy cutting-edge technology into production faster than ever before.\n\nThe openai-gradio package is part of Hugging Face\u2019s broader strategy to empower developers and disrupt the traditional AI model development cycle.\n\nAs Kevin Weil, OpenAI\u2019s Chief Product Officer, mentioned during the company\u2019s recent DevDay, lowering the barriers to AI adoption is critical to accelerating its use across industries.\n\nHugging Face\u2019s package directly addresses this need by simplifying the development process while maintaining the power of OpenAI\u2019s LLMs.\n\nHugging Face\u2019s openai-gradio package makes AI development as easy as writing a few lines of code. It opens the door for businesses to quickly build and deploy AI-powered web apps, leveling the playing field for startups and enterprises alike.\n\nThe tool strips away much of the complexity that has traditionally slowed down AI adoption, offering a faster, more approachable way to harness the power of OpenAI\u2019s language models.\n\nAs more industries dive into AI, the need for scalable, cost-effective tools has never been greater. Hugging Face\u2019s solution meets this need head-on, making it possible for developers to go from prototype to production in a fraction of the time.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a small team testing the waters or a larger company scaling up, openai-gradio offers a practical, no-nonsense approach to getting AI into the hands of users. In a landscape where speed and agility are everything, if you\u2019re not building with AI now, you\u2019re already playing catch-up."

The tool, which lets you search you Google Photos library with natural language questions like \"where did we camp last time we went to Yosemite?\", is now appearing for many in the Google Photos app.\n\nThe rollout confirms that 'Ask Photos' will effectively replace the current 'Search' tab in the app's bottom bar. Once you've agreed to Google's data requests (more on that later), it'll work across Google Photos on all platforms tied to your account. You can apparently still use the old search, but only if you asked the question in Ask Photos first.\n\nThe feature is mainly focused on answering questions about the people in your life, but Google says it'll also be a helpful vacation assistant. One of its example questions during the launch back at Google IO 2024 was \"what did we eat at the hotel in Stanley?\" and it'll presumably also be able to recall hotel names, license plates and more \u2013 in short, anything that you've photographed and backed up.\n\nUnfortunately, 'Ask Photos' is currently a US-only feature, but we've asked Google for an update on a potential global rollout and we'll update this story if we hear back.\n\nA frighteningly knowledgeable sidekick\n\nGoogle Photos has morphed from being a fairly basic photo organizer to an AI-powered memory bank \u2013 and the new 'Ask Photos' feature is its biggest search upgrade for some time.

        "article_content": "San Diego is believed to be packed with paranormal prowlers all year round, from a ghostly ship crew whose love for their ship persists through death to a grizzly old beast that lurks in the woods.\n\nGrab a flashlight and creep into the spooky spirit by exploring the following reportedly haunted locations.\n\nBerkeley Steam Ferry Boat\n\nThe Berkeley Steam Ferry Boat first operated in the late 1800s on the San Francisco Bay, and played a large role in rescuing citizens in a 7.9 magnitude earthquake in 1906. Today it serves as a hub for the Maritime Museum of San Diego, housing offices, a research library and more. Multiple former passengers are believed to haunt the boat today, one of whom is miner John Norbom, who died in an onboard explosion in 1911. There have been reports of the bathroom stalls, where the explosion took place, locking themselves, and some visitors claim to have seen a ghostly figure dressed in a fedora and coat looming around the ship. Earthquake victims and others who were injured in the explosion are believed to roam the boat, evidenced by reports of mysterious slamming doors and disappearing objects. 1492 N. Harbor Drive, San Diego\n\nCosmopolitan Hotel and restaurant\n\nOriginally designed as a home for cattle rancher Don Juan Bandini, the Cosmopolitan Hotel is said to have seen a few friendly apparitions. When Bandini\u2019s youngest daughter, Ysidora, leaned too far over the home\u2019s second-floor balcony railing and fell, it\u2019s believed that she was saved by Colonel Cave Johnson Couts, who caught her below. The two supposedly married soon after, but Ysidora\u2019s ghost is said to linger in room 11 of the hotel, where she once lived. There have also been sightings of an apparition of a cat roaming the hallways. Both are reported to be playful and friendly. 2660 Calhoun St., San Diego\n\nDavis-Horton House\n\nFormerly known as the William Heath Davis house, the Davis-Horton house was built in 1850, making it the oldest surviving structure in San Diego. It was once used as a makeshift hospital and much of its paranormal presence has been attributed to the fact that many died in the building. Among the numerous ghosts that have been spotted at the residence are a mysterious Victorian woman and a man wearing a World War II uniform. The home is on the National Registry of Historic Places and currently serves as the office for the Gaslamp Quarter Historical Foundation as well as the Gaslamp Museum. Tours are offered weekly. 410 Island Ave., San Diego\n\nDel Mar Fairgrounds\n\nRumors of paranormal activity at the fairgrounds have been circulating among employees for years. From magically moving furniture to strange sounds at night, many employees have reported supernatural experiences with the spirits of the fairgrounds. Former fairgrounds spokeswoman Linda Zweig decided to call on South Coast Paranormal to investigate in early 2011. The team uncovered what they believed to be \u201cvoices from the disembodied\u201d and spent five nights awake on the supposedly haunted fifth floor of the grandstand to investigate. 2260 Jimmy Durante Blvd., Del Mar\n\nEl Campo Santo Cemetery\n\nA few blocks from the Whaley House in Old Town San Diego, the El Campo Santo Cemetery has been continuously studied by paranormal experts due to the volume of supernatural reports from the area. When the city was becoming overcrowded in the 19th century, graves were relocated and many were paved over to make way for a road, disrespecting the spirits at rest below. Most paranormal reports from the cemetery include ghosts roaming the grounds, many dressed in period appropriate clothing, as well as car alarms going off and vehicles not starting when parked in front of the graveyard. 2410 San Diego Ave., San Diego\n\nElfin Forest\n\nThe Elfin Forest is home to a number of ghost stories, from the vengeful white witch who is believed to be searching for the murderer of her son and husband, to the 10-foot owl that hovers around the area. Nicole Strickland from the San Diego Paranormal Research Society said that many have reported feeling a sense of doom when passing through the area in the dark. 8833 Harmony Grove Road, Escondido\n\nHorton Grand Hotel\n\nRoom 309 of the Horton Grand Hotel has a haunting history. The room was once occupied by notorious gambler Roger Whitaker, known in the mid-1800s for his drinking and cheating habits. One night, his debts caught up with him when he was shot dead by creditors while hiding in the room\u2019s armoire. Today, the room has been reported as a site for paranormal activity, which many believe is caused by Whitaker\u2019s ghost. A female spirit belonging to Ida Bailey is also said to be present at the hotel. Bailey was the owner of a brothel that once operated right where the hotel was built, and has been reported to haunt the spot in the form of white mist or a cold chill. 311 Island Ave., San Diego\n\nHotel del Coronado\n\nThe ghost of 24-year-old \u201cbeautiful stranger\u201d Kate Morgan is believed to haunt this lavish hotel. Morgan checked into the hotel on Thanksgiving Day in 1892. Five days later, she was reported to have been found dead, dressed in black with a lace shawl over her head and a gunshot wound in her right temple. Police found no sure way to identify her immediately, so Morgan was referred to as \u201cbeautiful stranger\u201d by many news outlets. Today, she is said to be the hotel\u2019s resident ghost, playful but harmless. Guests and staff have reported flickering lights, electricity issues and various other oddities in the room that Morgan stayed in, and paranormal experts have been able to document this activity using infrared cameras, radiation sensors and sound detectors. 1500 Orange Ave., Coronado\n\nHunter Steakhouse\n\nPerched on a hill above the Buena Vista Lagoon, Hunter Steakhouse was built atop the old Buena Vista cemetery which is believed to have held around 50 bodies. In 1970, some of those bodies were moved to a different cemetery to allow for commercial developments, and it is said that the developer covered up bodily remains to speed up construction. Customers of the steakhouse have reported experiencing power surges, cold spots and a ghostly figure lingering near the stairs of the bar. 1221 Vista Way, Oceanside\n\nJulian Pioneer Cemetery\n\nMany Gold Rush-era ore miners were put to rest in the Julian Pioneer Cemetery in the 1870s. The cemetery was declared a California historical landmark in 1948, and has drawn paranormal experts for decades due to reports of ghostly men in 19th-century mining clothes as well as an eerie woman in a nightgown. 2811 Washington St., Julian\n\nLake Morena\n\nNamed one of \u201cthe most haunted campgrounds in the U.S.\u201d by Outside Magazine, Lake Morena is said to have supernatural energy. A San Diego Union article from 1983 titled \u201cMore than Fish Haunt Morena\u201d recounts the horrifying stories of those who had experienced strange happenings at the park, from the sound of thundering footsteps to haunting men appearing to walk on air. Today the spooky encounters have continued, with campers hearing screaming and feeling an omnipotent presence. 2550 Lake Morena Drive, Campo\n\nMt. Woodson Castle\n\nThis 27-room, 12,000-square-foot castle is believed by some to be occupied by the ghost of former owner and designer of the home Amy Strong. The castle was completed in 1921 and was listed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1978. Supposedly, the sound of Strong sewing on her machine fills the night, despite the fact that she died in 1950. Some say that a worker who lost his finger while working on the home can also be heard scratching the rocks outside trying to recover the finger. While the chief financial officer of Personal Touch Dining, which now manages the castle, claims she has never seen a ghost on-site, others aren\u2019t so convinced. Speculation surrounds the Zodiac room that Strong built in the home and her increasing interest in the spiritual realm in her older days. 16302 N. Woodson Drive, Ramona\n\nOld Point Loma lighthouse\n\nOver 150 years old, the Old Point Loma Lighthouse is a beacon for ghostly encounters. Visitors have reported hearing heavy footsteps, moaning and labored breathing while exploring the space in addition to sporadic cold spots. Some believe that the spirit of former Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who landed at San Diego Bay in 1542, occupies the space. Others believe that it is the spirit of Captain Robert Decatur Israel, the lighthouse\u2019s final lightkeeper, who remains to protect his precious lighthouse. The lighthouse was shut down in 1891 and now remains part of the Cabrillo National Monument. 1800 Cabrillo Memorial Drive\n\nProctor Valley\n\nStories of the gigantic hairy beast from the Proctor Valley area date back to more than a century ago, with stories of disembodied limbs frightening some and enticing others to go out monster hunting. The monster has become a sort of legend for the community, with a local playwright penning a musical comedy show titled \u201cThe Return of the Proctor Valley Monster\u201d which has been performed locally many times. The Bonita Museum keeps a footprint on display that is believed to belong to the Proctor Valley monster. Some blame the Proctor Valley\u2019s missing cattle on the monster, while others simply chuckle at the mention of it. Proctor Valley Rd., Chula Vista\n\nRancho Buena Vista Abobe\n\nThe Rancho Buena Vista Adobe was built in 1846 and is filled with historical artifacts and architecture. Over the years it has changed ownership several times. The city of Vista purchased the property in 1989 and now operates it as a historical museum. Experts believe the Adobe to serve as a portal to connect the living and spirit worlds, thankfully one that is believed to only accept peaceful ghosts. 640 Alta Vista Drive, Vista\n\nSan Diego Bay\n\nThere have been reports of San Diego\u2019s very own sea monster lurking in the bay since 1873. The initial sighting was reported by Captain George Charlesworth, who reported a 30-foot \u201cserpent-fish\u201d that he claims drew itself out of the water and onto the sand. Charlesworth\u2019s sighting led to an Academy of Sciences meeting and several expeditions in an attempt to sight the monster, but to no avail. All that was left were markings in the mud where the creature was believed to have slithered away.\n\nStar of India\n\nThe Star of India tall ship is the world\u2019s oldest active sailing ship, having been on the sea since 1863 and making a total of 21 voyages around the world before its retirement. The ship is believed to be haunted by the spirits of those who died aboard, including young stowaway John Campbell, who died falling 100 feet from the rigging, and Army Capt. McBarnet who slit his own throat and ultimately bled to death. All sorts of paranormal activity have been reported since. The ship is part of the Maritime Museum of San Diego and is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. 1492 N Harbor Drive, San Diego\n\nUSS Midway Museum\n\nThis decommissioned Navy aircraft carrier-turned-museum is said to be home to a number of ghosts. Back when the ship was still in service, many crew members believed there to be a crew of ghosts living among them, and to this day, visitors and staff have reported ghostly sightings all around the ship. The museum\u2019s curator and leader of San Diego\u2019s largest paranormal group, David Hanson, has deemed the ship as \u201cparanormally active\u201d rather than \u201chaunted\u201d due to the negative connotation that the latter holds. He believes that the crew members that linger on Midway have returned out of love for the ship and are not to be feared. 910 N Harbor Drive, San Diego midway.org\n\nVilla Montezuma Museum\n\nThis Sherman Heights mansion was named a historical site by the city of San Diego in 1970 due to its Victorian style architecture. Built in 1887, the mansion is believed to be haunted by former resident Jesse Shepard. Shepard was a writer, musician and spiritualist who only resided in Villa Montezuma for a few years, despite having the mansion specially built to include music rooms and hidden doorways. The story goes that Shepard used to host seances in the home, claiming to have communicated with the spirits of Mozart and Beethoven. He is believed to have died on a piano bench, eerily right as he finished playing a song. Witnesses say a bright and enchanting energy has been left in his wake. Today, tours of the mansion museum are available Fridays through Sundays. Chair of the friends of the Villa Montezuma Louis Torio describes the mansion as \u201cmagical\u201d and radiating a \u201cpositive energy.\u201d 1925 K St., San Diego\n\nWhaley House\n\nBuilt atop San Diego\u2019s old execution grounds, the Whaley House in Old Town was once home to an unlucky family of five. Despite being aware of the land\u2019s dark history, entrepreneur Thomas Whaley decided to proceed with the construction of his family\u2019s home in 1857, and even placed a large arch in the parlor room of the home to mark the exact spot where former Yankee thief Jim Robinson experienced a drawn out and grueling execution. The Whaley family experienced a total of five deaths during their time living in the home, including several children and Thomas\u2019 wife, Anna. The home has been said to be haunted by their spirits ever since. The home was deemed \u201cthe most haunted house in America\u201d by Life magazine. Today, the home is open to the public for self-guided daytime tours or haunted night tours. A tour guide at the home reported that a doll in the nursery room of the home is known to shift positions at night when the museum closes for the day. 2476 San Diego Ave., San Diego."

        "article_content": "WATERLOO \u2014 Old houses like the Rensselaer Russell House and Snowden House have long memories. There is an energy that recalls past lives lived inside their walls, permeating every creaking floorboard.\n\nAuthor and paranormal investigator Katie Hopkins will share her experiences and explorations into realms beyond the ordinary \u2013 including haunting occurrences at the Russell House, in special fundraising events Oct. 19.\n\n\u201cParanormal 101 Presentation and Book Signing\u201d is at 5 p.m. at the historic Snowden House, 306 Washington St., hosted by Friends of the Grout\u2019s Historic Houses. Hopkins will discuss history of the paranormal, why research is important to paranormal investigators and various types of investigation methods.\n\nHopkins, of Cedar Rapids, will also sign copies of her books, \u201cSeeing Spirits: Opening the Empathic Door\u201d and \u201cIowa Haunted Corridor.\u201d Copies will be available to purchase for $15.\n\nFollowing the presentation, guests will venture into shadowy corridors and spaces where spirits may linger in grand 1861 Rensselaer Russell House Museum, 520 W. Third St., and the historic Victorian-era Snowden House. Both homes are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hopkins and her husband Josh and Lollman Paranormal will lead the paranormal investigation at both houses using the latest paranormal investigation equipment.\n\nBoth events are fundraisers for the Friends of the Grout Historic Houses, benefiting the Russell House Museum and Snowden House. Pre-registration is required for both events. The presentation and book signing are $15 for members; $20 for non-members. The investigation is $50 for members; $55 for non-members. To register visit www.gmdistrict.org/calendar.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for different ways to raise money to support preservation of our two houses. We thought something like this might attract a different and perhaps a younger audience,\u201d said Hawkeye Community College instructor Marcea Seible. She also serves on the Friends board.\n\n\u201cWe would love to sell out. We\u2019re hopeful that it will be a popular event, and we can do something similar in the coming years,\u201d Seible explained.\n\nHopkins was 10 when she saw her first spirit in the basement of a friend\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cThat was the focus of my first book. I \u2018ve always been interested in the paranormal and supernatural. My first interest was in history \u2013 that\u2019s what drew me into the paranormal, too, exploring really cool historical places where ghost hunters get to go into,\u201d she said.\n\nShe earned a history degree at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls and a master\u2019s degree in higher education from Kaplan University. She worked as an intern at the Grout in 2008 and returned in 2012 as a museum assistant, which included managing the Rensselaer Russell House Museum.\n\nWhether or not the Rensselaer Russell House is haunted, it has had its share of tragedy and loss. In 1862, 5-year-old Genevieve Russell fell into a well on a neighboring property and drowned. Her funeral wake took place in the Russell home. Once, while in the master bedroom looking at a photograph of Genevieve, Hopkins felt a small hand grab her leg. She\u2019s convinced she was touched by the child\u2019s spirit.\n\n\u201cI was in the Russell House alone eight hours a day. I\u2019d see things move and hear things \u2013 footsteps on the stairs or glassware sitting on the dining table rattle, or find the photo of Genevieve moved, when I was the only one there,\u201d Hopkins recalled.\n\nOn one occasion, she closed the museum, and the next morning found every drawer and cabinet door open, although the house was still locked up tight. Hopkins once heard the doorbell signal someone entering and searched the house to find no one else there. Other people recount seeing a girl in an upper window of the house, and a light at night when the museum is closed.\n\nIn 2012, with Hopkins\u2019 encouragement, the Grout board allowed the Calhoun County Paranormal Investigators to set up video and recording equipment and electromagnetic field detectors and stayed overnight in the house.\n\n\u201cI really made a connection with that house and the spirits in it. I\u2019m so excited to be back to do these fundraisers,\u201d said Hopkins. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many historical houses and buildings fall into disrepair. People lived in these houses and experienced love, loss and tragedy. These are so much more than just old buildings.\u201d\n\nThe need for funds is serious and ongoing, said Seible.\n\n\u201cAll money goes directly to upkeep and maintenance at the houses. Both houses need work, the Russell house, in particular. It really needs foundation work \u2013 limestone is crumbling in some places, so that\u2019s the most pressing issue.\u201d\n\nClose Nicholas Erickson, artifacts registrar at Grout Museum District, looks over the telegram sent to Henry Grout informing him his brother, Warren, had been shot and killed in Tombstone, Ariz., in 1883.

        "article_content": "1. \u201cHalloween\u201d (1978, and subsequent series)\n\nThis one is a little obvious, but it\u2019s an obvious choice for a reason. \u201cHalloween\u201d is a quintessential slasher movie with several sequels and remakes that are all almost equally as good as the first. Mike Myers is the muse of many of your favorite slashers, and Jamie Lee Curtis is everything you should be looking for in a protagonist. Once you get further into the series, you\u2019ll start to feel a lot better about your sibling drama. Make sure to watch the Rob Zombie remakes, too.\n\n2. \u201cScream\u201d (1996, and subsequent series)\n\nAnother pretty self-explanatory choice, \u201cScream\u201d takes place during Halloween, so what could be more fitting (other than the aforementioned film)? If you\u2019re looking for a new series for your Halloween movie nights, you\u2019ve found the one. A classic slasher series with gore, plot twists and an incredible final girl; what more could you want?\n\n3. \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d (1991)\n\nNow we\u2019re getting a little weird. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a classic and a great film, but if the idea of cannibalism freaks you out, this flick isn\u2019t for you. To those of you who can stomach some people-eating, \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d is a good psychological thriller and horror movie in general, with a great cast and an incredible plot. Hannibal Lecter is a remarkably likable (loosely used) serial killer, even if he\u2019d picture you as an appetizer.\n\n4. \u201cThe Shining\u201d (1980)\n\nAll work and no play makes Ava a very dull writer, so it\u2019s good that this one is entertaining. Stephen King, the king of horror (pun absolutely intended) has inspired many good films, but this one tops the list. Many shows and movies make references to this iconic film, and they never get old. Looking for a slow-burn, paranormal and psychological thriller? King has your back with this one.\n\n5. \u201cNightmare on Elm Street\u201d (1984)\n\nA movie about a murderer that can get you in your dreams? Sign me up! To verge on more of the paranormal, what is more eerie than a killer that can only harm you in your dreams? With knives for fingers and a face like Deadpool, Freddy Krueger is a slasher that you won\u2019t easily forget. You also won\u2019t regret seeing Johnny Depp in a crop top, back in his prime and before he became such an\u2026 interesting guy.\n\n6. \u201cIt\u201d (1986)\n\nClowns aren\u2019t for everybody. If you can move past that, then you will love \u201cIt.\u201d Another one of Stephen King\u2019s brainchilds, \u201cIt\u201d combines the paranormal with sci-fi, and a coming-of-age storyline. While the original is deemed to be a classic, the remakes from 2017 and 2019 are arguably just as good. Pennywise the clown gets a bit more attractive, too, if you\u2019re into that kind of thing.\n\n7. \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d (1973)\n\nI know I keep saying classic, and it\u2019s super repetitive at this point, but this one is the classic of all classics. You know it is when the Scary Movie franchise makes a parody of it. \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d is a cult classic occult film. It is one of the most popular horror movies of all time, and for good reason. No matter how much time goes on, the demonic possession of Regan MacNeil never gets any less gross. If you have emetophobia, please steer clear.\n\n8. \u201cCarrie\u201d (1976)\n\nIf you hated prom, this one is perfect for you. \u201cCarrie,\u201d another film inspired by a Stephen King novel, is a perfect combination of teenage angst and the paranormal. You\u2019ll end up hating most of the characters, so if you\u2019re already in a bad mood, maybe save this one for later. If you need any ideas for revenge, though, full speed ahead.\n\n9. \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d (2013, and subsequent series)\n\nMany would consider this paranormal flick to be a modern classic. With many spin-offs and sequels, \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d will always have another road for you to turn down. When you\u2019re looking for a demonic/ghost film, this should be in your top considerations. Don\u2019t let the \u201cbased on a true story\u201d warning deter you, though. The best horror movies come from real life.\n\n10. \u201cGet Out\u201d (2017)\n\nThis modern masterpiece, courtesy of Jordan Peele, will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The psychological thriller has a perfect amount of gore and unlikeable characters to make this a perfect film for a Halloween movie night with your roommates. Daniel Kaluuya is an incredible actor, so even if you\u2019re not into horror, watch it for him.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid! Watching these films will teach you how to avoid any creeper, ghost, slasher or cult that comes your way. Don\u2019t let your guard down, though. Danger lurks around every corner, and sometimes, even in our dreams. So, goodnight, sleep tight and don\u2019t let Freddy Krueger bite. Stay safe this Halloween season, and study up class. Your test is on October 31st.\n\nAva Hebenstreit can be reached at [email protected]."

        "article_content": "STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 Two scientists won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine on Monday for their discovery of microRNA, tiny bits of genetic material that serve as on and off switches inside cells that help control what the cells do and when they do it.\n\nIf scientists can better understand how they work and how to manipulate them, it could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer.\n\nThe work by Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun is \u201cproving to be fundamentally important for how organisms develop and function,\u201d according to a panel that awarded the prize in Stockholm.\n\nAmbros and Ruvkun were initially interested in genes that control the timing of different genetic developments, ensuring that cell types develop at the right time.\n\nTheir discovery ultimately \u201crevealed a new dimension to gene regulation, essential for all complex life forms,\u201d the panel said.\n\nWhat is the Nobel Prize for?\n\nRNA is best known for carrying instructions for how to make proteins from DNA in the nucleus of the cell to tiny cellular factories that actually build the proteins. MicroRNA does not make proteins, but helps to control what cells are doing, including switching on and off critical genes that make proteins.\n\nLast year\u2019s Nobel for medicine went to scientists who discovered how to manipulate one of those types of RNA, known as messenger RNA or mRNA, now used to make vaccines for COVID-19.\n\nAmbros\u2019 and Ruvkun\u2019s revolutionary discovery was initially made in worms; they set out to identify why some kinds of cells didn\u2019t develop in two mutant strains of worms commonly used as a research model in science.\n\n\u201cTheir groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans,\u201d according to the citation explaining the importance of their work.\n\nThat mechanism has been at work for hundreds of millions of years and has enabled evolution of complex organisms, it said.\n\nAmbros, currently a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, performed the research at Harvard University. Ruvkun\u2019s research was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, where he\u2019s a professor of genetics.\n\nWhy does microRNA matter?\n\nThe study of microRNA has opened up approaches to treating diseases like cancer because it helps regulate how genes work in our cells, said Dr. Claire Fletcher, a lecturer in molecular oncology at Imperial College London.\n\nFletcher said there were two main areas where microRNA could be helpful: in developing drugs to treat diseases and in serving as possible indicators of diseases, by tracking microRNA levels in the body.\n\n\u201cIf we take the example of cancer, we\u2019ll have a particular gene working overtime, it might be mutated and working in overdrive,\u201d said Fletcher. She said scientists might one day be able to use microRNA to stop such effects.\n\nEric Miska, a geneticist at Cambridge University, said the discovery by Ambros and Ruvkun came as a complete surprise, overturning what scientists had long understood about how cells work.\n\nTheir discovery of microRNA shocked many scientists, Miska said, explaining that such small bits of genetic material had never been seen before. The tiny fragments of RNA \u2014 the human genome has at least 800 \u2014 were later found to play critical roles in how our bodies develop.\n\nMiska said there is ongoing work on the role of microRNA in infectious diseases like hepatitis and that it might also be helpful in treating neurological diseases.\n\nFletcher said the most advanced studies to date are reviewing how microRNA approaches might help treat skin cancer, but no drugs have yet been approved. She predicted that might happen in the coming years, adding that most treatments at the moment target cell proteins.\n\n\u201cIf we can intervene at the microRNA level, it opens up a whole new way of us developing medicines,\u201d she said.\n\nHow did Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros react?\n\nThe phone call from the Nobel panel is often a surprise, but there are certain signs that recipients and their families pick up on.\n\n\u201cWell, when a phone rings at 4:30 in the morning. \u2026 It never happens here,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\n\u201cNatasha actually answered it,\u201d Ruvkun added, referring to his wife. \u201cAnd she goes: \u2018He has a Swedish accent.'\u201d\n\nIt took a little longer to rouse Ambros.\n\n\u201cSomebody called my son, who called my wife as my phone was downstairs,\u201d he said.\n\nRuvkun knew immediately the impact the award would have on his life.\n\n\u201cWell, I just kept repeating in my mind, this changes everything because you know, the Nobel is just mythic in how it transforms the life of people who are selected,\u201d Ruvkun said. \u201cThe Nobel Prize is a recognition that\u2019s sort of 100 times as much press and celebration as any other award. So, it\u2019s not part of a continuum. It\u2019s a quantum leap.\u201d\n\nGoing to pick up his award in December will be the third time he has been to a Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm after attending to watch his mentor Robert Horvitz receive the 2002 award and then his buddy Jack Szostak, who won in 2009.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a trip coming up. It will be the third, possibly the best,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\nAmbros said he didn\u2019t expect the award as he felt that the Nobel committee has already singled out RNA in the 2006 prize that went to his friends Andrew Fire and Craig Mello.\n\n\u201cIt represents the recognition of how wonderful and unexpected discoveries come from a curiosity in basic science financed by taxpayer money. It\u2019s a vitally important, probably the most important message, that this investment really pays off,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine went to Hungarian-American Katalin Karik\u00f3 and American Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 that were critical in slowing the pandemic.\n\nThe prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the prize\u2019s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.\n\nNobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on Oct. 14."

It praised the \u201cgroundbreaking discovery,\u201d which the committee said \u201crevealed an entirely new dimension to gene regulation.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of gene regulation by microRNA \u2013 a family of molecules that helps cells control the sort of proteins they make that has been at work for hundreds of millions of years \u2013 was the result of decades of work by Ambros, a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and Ruvkun, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\u201cTheir discovery\u2026 is of fundamental importance to understand how cells work, and thus how organisms develop,\u201d said Love Dal\u00e9n, a professor of evolutionary genomics at Stockholm University. \u201cThis finding was groundbreaking, and has affected more or less all fields of biology and medicine,\u201d he told CNN via email.\n\nNobel Committee Secretary General Thomas Perlmann speaks to the media in front of a picture of this year's laureates Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun during the announcement of the Nobel Prize in medicine winners on Monday. Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHow cells do different things\n\n\u201cThe information stored within our chromosomes can be likened to an instruction manual for all cells in our body. Every cell contains the same chromosomes, so every cell contains exactly the same set of genes and exactly the same set of instructions,\u201d the committee said in a statement, detailing the duo\u2019s work.\n\nAnd yet, different cell types \u2013 such as muscle and nerve cells \u2013 have different characteristics. The two biologists have spent their careers investigating how these differences arise.\n\n\u201cThe answer lies in gene regulation, which allows each cell to select only the relevant instructions. This ensures that only the correct set of genes is active in each cell type,\u201d the committee said.\n\nGene regulation by microRNA has aided the evolution of increasingly complex organisms. If gene regulation goes awry, it can lead to cancer and other conditions found in humans and other animals, like hearing loss and skeletal disorders.\n\n\u201cMicroRNAs are very much implicated in cancer. There is ongoing research to make treatments or utilize micro RNAs \u2013 mimic microRNA or block microRNA \u2013 to treat cancer. There\u2019s some technical hurdles in that so there\u2019s not been any drugs yet,\u201d said Thomas Perlmann, secretary-general of the Nobel Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re awarding this because of its fundamental importance for the basic understanding of physiology. We know historically that these big discoveries, they translate into clinical improvements but it takes time,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nFrom \u2018oddity\u2019 to fundamental discovery\n\nIn their early work, the pair studied the genetic make-up of a tiny 1 millimeter-long roundworm, C. elegans. Despite its small size, this worm possesses many specialized cell types, such as nerve and muscle cells, that are also found in larger, more complex animals, making it a useful model for investigating how tissues develop and mature in multicellular organisms.\n\n\u201cThe first micro RNA was discovered by Victor Ambros in 1993 but it was thought to be an oddity, peculiar to a small worm, C. elegans, for more than seven years,\u201d said Olle K\u00e4mpe, a professor in endocrinology at the Karolinksa Institutet and vice chair of the Nobel medicine committee.\n\nThat 1993 discovery was met by \u201cdeafening silence\u201d and initially thought irrelevant to humans, the committee said, until Ruvkun published his discovery of another microRNA, which is now known to be present throughout the animal kingdom.\n\n\u201cThen the field exploded,\u201d said K\u00e4mpe. \u201cNow, more than tens of thousands of microRNAs have been identified in different organisms.\u201d\n\nNobel recognition for Ambros and Ruvkun has been anticipated by many for years, said David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate\u2019s Institute for Scientific Information.\n\n\u201cThey (microRNAs) offer potential diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities in treating cancer and other diseases. Clinical trials are underway to utilize microRNA profiling for patient prognosis and clinical response,\u201d Pendlebury told CNN.\n\nJanosch Heller, an assistant professor in biomedical sciences at Dublin City University, said that the work \u201copened our eyes to the wonderful machinery that is tightly controlling what is happening in our cells.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of microRNA also helps explain why many organisms have a similar number of genes despite displaying varying levels of complexity, said Joshua Rosenthal, a senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory, part of the University of Chicago.\n\n\u201cOver the past two decades we\u2019ve sequenced the entire genomes of an incredibly wide variety of organisms. One surprising result is that the number of genes required to encode a tiny nematode worm, a fish and a human being is about the same. If that\u2019s the case, then how is complexity generated?\u201d he told CNN.\n\n\u201cThe answer appears to be in the sophisticated ways that the information within these genes, like a light, can be turned on, off and dimmed. We now know that microRNAs, once discarded by scientists as a contaminant getting in the way of studying \u2018more important\u2019 RNAs, are key components for regulating genes in virtually every cell in every tissue in every plant and animal,\u201d Rosenthal added.\n\nLast year, the prize was awarded to Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman for their work on MRNA vaccines, a crucial tool in curtailing the spread of Covid-19.\n\nThe prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million).\n\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

        "article_content": "Listen to this story\n\nWith tools like Cursor, Claude, and ChatGPT canvas are on the boom, allowing users to build software using natural language, it feels highly reminiscent of the times when LC/NC platforms also lowered the barrier to entry for app development and made it easier for companies to teach their developers the existing solutions within the companies.\n\nThe community is now questioning the relevance of low-code/no-code (LC/NC) platforms in the AI era. How do these platforms continue to stay relevant in a landscape dominated by artificial intelligence?\n\nWhile these tools were a great choice for prototyping an idea or starting a project, LC/NC platforms are a nightmare when considering scaling a project, which seems to be the same for modern AI coding tools. Not much has changed.\n\nAmidst the challenges and shift towards AI coding tools, is there still a role for low-code, no-code platforms, like Bubble and Webflow, in today\u2019s landscape, and are they able to coexist with emerging AI solutions?\n\nAccording to a Reddit user, even when he got help from AI to write a custom function for the no-code platform, it failed terribly. Two days later, he started writing the code himself and it worked out pretty well.\n\n\u201cWhen building an app you want to own with popular low-code/no-code platforms, even if they mention that you legally own an IP to your app, what meaning does it hold if you cannot run it on-premise?\u201d Andreas M\u00f8ller, the co-founder of toddle, told AIM. This seems to be a common reason why the adoption of low-code no-code platforms took some time.\n\nWe witness the same with AI tools, given the hallucinations and other privacy issues. But in certain cases, they are able to do the job a lot quicker than any no-code platforms that ever existed.\n\nFor example, Meghana Jagadeesh, the founder & CEO of GoCodeo, mentioned at Cypher 2024 that LC/NC tools will still be relevant and will grow in the future, but with an AI twist in them.\n\n\u201cWhen AI capabilities are added to LC/NC platforms, it gets easier for non-tech guys to build specific functions. These tools are a great choice to get started before scaling it for a large user base,\u201d she said, suggesting that we should not confuse LC/NC tools with traditional development as they cater to different user needs.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have Git, a version-controlling system, I\u2019m obviously not going to build a big project on your platform. That is a deal breaker for every developer,\u201d said M\u00f8ller while explaining why it is necessary for every developer to have a version-control system to build a SaaS application.\n\nDue to these issues, we saw companies like Klarna drop solutions built on top of LC/NC platforms and create in-house solutions using AI for better scalability and profit.\n\nThis is the reason we are seeing tools like toddle and Apptile, which are a little different from the traditional LC/NC platforms. Samyam Annappa, founder and CTO at Apptile, told AIM that coding typically makes up less than 25% of the total project cost. Most of the time goes into setting up the infrastructure\u2014analytics pipelines, payment gateways, notifications, device testing, and managing both iOS and Android versions.\n\n\u201cThat is where tools like Apptile simplify this by taking care of the heavy lifting behind the scenes. Additionally, our architecture supports real-time content updates, unlike tools like Cursor, which necessitate code changes, App Store reviews, and App Store rejection handling for content updates,\u201d he added, further suggesting that to stay relevant in the AI era, LC/NC platforms must overcome traditional issues and offer streamlined solutions.\n\nSimilarly to Apptile, tools like toddle, which is not entirely an LC/NC platform but something in between LC/NC and traditional platforms, allows users to build specific functions and host your infrastructure, and has plans to go open source by the end of 2025, so you can actually own your software.\n\nWill LLMs replace LC/NC Platforms?\n\nLC/NC platforms have to adapt to the changes all developers are going through \u2013 the AI change. Jinen Dedhia, the founder of DronaHQ mentioned on HackerNews that he also believes that LLMs can remove the need for LC/NC platforms and the only way to stay relevant is to tightly integrate AI capabilities to LC/NC platforms.\n\n\u201cBut I do see the merit in this thinking that LLMs can eat LCNC platforms for breakfast. However, I am excited to see how with time near perfect applications can be churned out with about 80-90% work done and engineers can figure the last few miles and reach the finish line but 50x faster,\u201d he added further.\n\nIn fact, the LC/NC platforms produce very well-structured code behind the scenes and they can train LLMs to build apps following their well defined structure, which means their apps can still take advantage of the LLMs but will have less bugs than just letting the LLMs produce a stand-alone app.\n\nWhile LC/NC platforms may provide a simplified interface for creating applications, they do not eliminate the need for a foundational understanding of programming concepts, same as the AI tools like Cursor, ChatGPT, or GitHub Copilot.\n\nOf course, the LLMs can produce more versatile apps than LC/NC platforms but considering LLMs as a competitor to LC/NC platforms might not be a correct idea."

From an early age, the trio worked well together \u2014 and now, in their mid-20s, they are in business together.\n\n\"Sasha was basically our mom's third son,\" Daniel Andrews told Business Insider. \"Growing up, we all worked in my mom's preschool \u2014 and the three of us realized we could help our family run the place better with technological improvements.\"\n\nThe Andrews had a strong technical background, with degrees in computer science and engineering, while Reiss had expertise in design.\n\nTogether, they founded and launched Playground, a preschool software management startup that handles everything from registration and payroll to attendance. The startup has raised $3.4 million since its launch in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trio are part of a growing 'friendpreneur' trend that's particularly popular among Gen Zs.\n\nResearch published in July and commissioned by AI photo app Photoroom \u2014 which surveyed 6,000 respondents across the US, UK, Mexico, Brazil, Korea, and Japan \u2014 found that more Gen Zs are launching startups with their friends. Around 60% of Gen Z founders who were surveyed had involved their friends in the business, compared to 42% of millennials and 21% of Gen X and boomers.\n\nReiss and the Andrews brothers said that working together as friends has elevated their relationship and provided advantages for their business.\n\nRelated stories\n\nWorking as friends has streamlined communication\n\nThe trio said they find it easier to discuss business decisions honestly because they are used to organically communicating with one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're each other's biggest fans, but we're also each other's biggest critics,\" Daniel Andrews said. \"So we could take really intense feedback incredibly well, and we're able to turn things that might come off as a little bit rude into something more constructive because we can read between the lines, having just been knowing each other so long.\"\n\n\"We've been able to operate significantly faster and be honest with each other because we have that initial layer and unconditional love for each other,\" Reiss added.\n\nSpending so much time together has also proven to be a business boon.\n\n\"I've been living with Sasha for four years, and it's pretty much a 24-hour cycle of hanging out minus sleep,\" Josh Andrews said. \"But it's created a really good feedback loop where we take work home, but we also know how to have that separation when we leave the office.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReiss said that having an aligned schedule has also helped the three get \"ideas flowing naturally\" outside an office setting.\n\n\"I think a lot of our best ideas were made maybe at a bar getting a drink, or at a restaurant just getting dinner, and you're not even thinking about work \u2014 and I think that's a big reason why we come up with a lot of novel ideas for our visits,\" Daniel Andrews said.\n\nHe added that their \"shared life experience\" has made them more empathetic and understanding of each other.\n\n\"We have had a lot of family health issues over the last couple of years as we've been on this journey,\" he told BI. \"Being a first-time founder, it is incredibly beneficial to work with friends and family who can step up and take on that work. The lowest points definitely feel a lot less low when you have these kinds of people around you.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPick friends wisely\n\nWorking with friends also poses its own challenges.\n\n\"We have similar backgrounds in similar skill sets, and so intentionally seeking out hires that bring a diverse background that's very different than ours has been much more important for us,\" Daniel Andrews said.\n\nBeing a part of the same friend group can also pose logistical roadblocks. The trio often get invites to the same holidays or events \u2014 sometimes resulting in an \"out of office\" from all three.\n\n\"We've definitely navigated that by having people stay behind; we'd be like, okay we can't all leave right now,\" Josh Andrews said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the trio is enthusiastic about the concept of launching a company as friends, they agree it's only worthwhile if they bring out the best in each other.\n\n\"If you have friends that you find that are like slowing you down, or like trying to distract you, or other things, those might not be the best friends to launch a startup with,\" Daniel Andrews said.\n\n\"But there are those friends who are always pushing me to run harder, do that extra like hike, run that mile faster.\n\n\"Those are the people that you really want to engage and work on something with. And I think selectively picking up friends who are available and those who are trying to push you to be better is the correct path forward,\" he added."

        "article_content": "Amazon is offering just about the cheapest way to get a recent Apple Watch on your wrist during its Prime Big Deals Days 2024 promotion, with a model you may have forgotten existed. You can buy a second-generation Apple Watch SE in various colors and with a choice of bands for $170 if you version or $200 if you . If you\u2019ve wondered what life with an Apple Watch is like, now is the time to find out.\n\nIt\u2019s not the latest Apple Watch Series 10 model, but it\u2019s about half its price, and although it doesn\u2019t have the same specifications, when that kind of saving is involved, there are some acceptable sacrifices. The second-generation Apple Watch SE was released in 2022, and with several more expensive models launched since then and no replacement from Apple, it has stopped being part of the conversation. However, that\u2019s unfair as the SE 2 has an aluminum case, Ion-X protective glass, a nylon composite case back, a heart rate sensor, an OLED screen, and a battery that should last at least a day with normal use.\n\nIt looks the same as the first Apple Watch SE and many other Apple Watch models, but is smaller and thicker than the current Series 10 model. It doesn\u2019t have an always-on screen, so it won\u2019t show the time until you raise your wrist to see the screen. The good news is this feature works so well that you won\u2019t ever be left staring at a blank screen. Don\u2019t expect recent features like the Double Tap gesture or some of the advanced health features like an electrocardiogram, blood oxygen monitoring, or a body temperature sensor, though.\n\nWhere the Apple Watch SE 2 wins is with the software. It runs Apple\u2019s watchOS 11, just like the most recent models, so it won\u2019t feel any different operationally. It has the same control system, basically the same workout tracking with GPS, and it\u2019ll show you all your health data and notifications, too. Apple\u2019s all-day battery life claim is on the conservative side, and if you don\u2019t track workouts, it\u2019s possible for the battery to last deep into a second day before it needs recharging.\n\nWhen I wore the Apple Watch SE 2 ahead of my review when it was released, the lack of an always-on screen bothered me, but mostly because I was coming from an Apple Watch that had the feature. Newcomers probably won\u2019t care, especially when the price is so competitive, and I did wonder at the time if we should be recommending it as the core Apple Watch to buy, as it did almost everything the more expensive model did. Two years on, and it lags further behind in headline features a design, but it\u2019s still a current model, meaning it\u2019ll be supported with new software for several years to come and remains a fantastic option for anyone wanting to try the best smartwatch you can buy without paying $350 or more.\n\nWhich color case you choose will be down to you, but I\u2019d recommend getting one of the models with a Sport Loop band if possible. It\u2019s more comfortable for all-day and night wear than the Sport Band, and its quick and easy adjustment makes it great for exercise. It may also be worth looking at the GPS and Cellular models, which are and , as they allow you to leave your phone at home and still stay connected, provided you add it to your regular phone plan. It\u2019s usually around $10 per month to do this.\n\nFew talk about the Apple Watch SE 2 these days, an oversight that probably needs correcting, but Amazon\u2019s low price makes this a brilliant smartwatch for anyone with an iPhone who wants to try life with an Apple Watch."
