        "article_content": "It's never aliens.\n\nAt least, it hasn't been yet. The United States Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities heard testimony on Tuesday (Nov. 19) from Jon T. Kosloski, director of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). The U.S. Department of Defense created the office in July 2022 in order to have a single place for military and government personnel to report UFO sightings, or UAP, as they're now known. The new term, short for unidentified anomalous phenomena, encompasses not only unidentified objects or events in the sky, but also those in water, in space or those that appear to travel between these domains.\n\nDuring today's hearing, Kosloski came in strong, stating that \"it is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has not discovered any verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology.\" Still, despite having resolved hundreds of cases with prosaic explanations, Kosloski noted that his office does not believe that every UAP is a bird, balloon or drone. \"We do have some very anomalous objects,\" he said.\n\nA still from a video captured by a U.S.-operated drone in 2018 while flying above Mt. Etna appears to show an anomalous object, but the Pentagon's UFO chief says his office was able to solve the case. (Image credit: AARO/DOD)\n\nKosloski also reported on the office's latest analysis of UFO/UAP cases, stressing that his office will \"continue to follow the science and data wherever they lead\" and keep both Congress and the public as informed as possible \u2014 at the unclassified level, he clarified.\n\nThat stands in stark contrast to testimony presented to a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee last week, in which a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former U.S. counterintelligence officer told lawmakers that the American government is part of a decades-long coverup to conceal the fact that \"we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nDuring his testimony, Kosloski gave an overview of his office's activities since it issued a report to Congress and testified in a similar setting last year. \"Many reports resolve to commonplace objects like birds, balloons and unmanned systems, while others lack sufficient data for comprehensive analysis,\" Kosloski said, adding that \"only a small percentage of reports received by AARO are potentially anomalous.\"\n\nKosloski referred to a UAP incident that occurred in 2013 near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. The infrared video, shot in 2013 by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol helicopter, appears to show an object flying just above the ocean before disappearing into it, or perhaps splitting in two.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

When the object appears to disappear in the infrared video that accompanies the case, it is actually the camera sensing that the object is the same temperature as the water behind it. Instead of splitting in two, it was simply two objects \u2014 balloons or sky lanterns \u2014 in close proximity that came in and out of view.\n\nKosloski also offered how his office was able to close the case on the infamous GOFAST video, shot by a U.S. Navy fighter jet in 2016 off the coast of Florida. In that case, the object's apparent speed in the video was actually due to the parallax effect, or the camera's perspective, Kosloski explained.\n\nFurthermore, the AARO director showed a 2018 video captured by a drone flying over Mt. Etna that he stated is not widely known among the public. \"This was a rather difficult case to solve,\" Kosloski said. \"The object was actually 170 meters away from the plume \u2014 not flying through it.\"\n\nDuring questioning, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) asked Kosloski about whether or not some individuals who have encountered UAP might be reluctant to engage with his office, referring to accusations some UAP disclosure advocates frequently level against AARO. These critics attest that the office is part of an alleged decades-long U.S. government-led campaign of \"excessive secrecy\" that aims to keep the public in the dark about UFOs.\n\nIn response to Gillibrand's questioning, Kosloski defended his office. \"Congress has gone out of its way to create the organization AARO specifically to conduct these sorts of investigations, and has uniquely empowered them to have access to all UAP related information, whether that's historic or current, and we take that responsibility and those authorities very seriously,\" he said.\n\nGillibrand also asked about a report released by AARO in March 2024, noting that she has been told \"it doesn't show any any evidence of secret programs that have aliens.\"\n\nBut Gillibrand pushed back on that assertion. \"That's not how I read the report,\" the senator said. \"What I read in the report is the US government took sightings extremely seriously over the last 75 years, and put some of the greatest minds together to analyze these cases, because they assessed them as some deeply unknown phenomena that may or may not cause threats \u2014 that may or may not be related to adversaries.\"\n\nA still from a video reportedly showing a \"transmedium\" UAP that appears to travel between air and water and split in half. During testimony on Nov. 19, the head of the Pentagon's UFO office says it actually shows an infrared camera's inability to tell two objects' temperature apart from the ocean behind them. (Image credit: AARO/DOD)\n\nAARO released a report to accompany today's hearing earlier this week. The report, titled, \"All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office\u2019s Annual Report on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena,\" examines UAP cases dated between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024 as well as historical incidents that were not included in previous reports.\n\nBut, like in its other reports, AARO found no smoking gun for alien visitation this year. \"AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,\" the report notes. Out of the 485 cases that are well within the report's timeframe, 118 were solved and another 174 were slated to be closed, pending a final review.\n\nStill, AARO's 2024 report says that many cases remain unsolved, and that the office continues to study them. However, AARO\u2019s ability to resolve cases \"remains constrained by a lack of timely and actionable sensor data,\" according to the report, meaning there just isn't enough data to conclusively solve cases that lack detailed or multi-sensor observations. In some cases, all there might be to analyze is a single photograph, a few seconds of grainy video or an aviator's written report. Many UAP sightings happen in the blink of an eye as an unknown object zooms past a moving aircraft, for example, so there often isn't enough time to gather photographic or video evidence.\n\nIn other cases, the capabilities of the sensors or platforms involved in the UAP sightings are themselves classified (sometimes, even their existence isn't publicly known), so AARO is unable to discuss them in unclassified reports.\n\nThough overall, according to the 2024 report, there is enough data for AARO to state that it has has \"no indication or confirmation that these activities are attributable to foreign adversaries.\"\n\nToday's hearing echoed a previous hearing held last year on April 19, 2023. During that hearing, AARO's previous director Sean Kirkpatrick told the Senate Armed Services Committee that his office has seen \"no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity, off-world technology or objects that defy the known laws of physics.\"\n\nSimilarly, the report released by AARO in March 2024 that examined historical UFO cases found \"no evidence that any USG [U.S. government] investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.\"\n\nAARO's previous report, released in 2022, examined 510 contemporary UAP reports gathered from government agencies and branches of the United States military. The report found that, while most cases were able to be resolved, 171 remained a mystery.\n\n\"Some of these uncharacterized UAP appear to have demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities, and require further analysis,\" AARO's 2022 report states.\n\nToday's hearing concluded with a discussion of recent incidents in which unidentified drones, or uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), were seen over U.S. military bases and other sensitive installations. Those incidents, Kosloski notes, underscore the need for the United States to have \"more persistent monitoring and understand that, whether it is a UAP or a counter-UAS issue, that we need to have that complete domain awareness around our national security facilities.\""

Why isn't UFO hearing tearing up Google trends? | Opinion\n\nYou would think if anything could break through the noise of our news cycle, UFOs could.\n\nThis needs to be a bigger deal folks because the American people, nay people of the world, need this right now.\n\nLast week, for the second time in two years, there was a Congressional subcommittee hearing on UFOs, or as they have been foolishly rebranded \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d shortened to UAPs.\n\nOne of the visionaries helping uncover the truth is none other than Wisconsin Congressman Glenn Grothman, R-Fond du Lac, who chairs the House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs.\n\nEditorial: Hovde's election claims are false. He's blaming Milwaukee \u2013 without evidence.\n\nLast week\u2019s hearing, \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\" including a new slate of witnesses who provided testimony about UFO sightings and what the government may or may not know about them. One witness, Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence officer, went so far to say, \"Excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public, all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nAlien spacecraft and dead extraterrestrials now in Congressional Record\n\nLast year\u2019s testimony included former Pentagon official David Grusch telling a Congressional committee that he\u2019d learned of a decades-long Pentagon program focused on \u201ccrash retrieval and reverse engineering\u201d of UFOs from other planets. Grusch also said that remains found at the spacecraft crash sites were \u201cnon-human biologics.\u201d\n\nYes, crashed alien spacecraft and dead extraterrestrials made it to the Congressional Record.\n\nHowever, neither in the aftermath of last year's and last week's hearing did the terms \"UFO\" \"Alien\" \"UAP\" or even \"government coverup\" break the 25 most searched terms in Google Trends.\n\nWhat were people searching for last week? Would it surprise you if I said: \"mike tyson jake paul fight.\"\n\nTo be fair, neither of these hearings has provided real evidence to prove UFOs or UAPs are extraterrestrial in nature. But the collection of testimony indicates that UAPs are very real in the sense there are a number of as-yet-unexplained phenomena.\n\nAnd yet, apparently, most of us do not care enough to let that information even make a blip on our news cycle.\n\nAll the more reason that right now is the right time for these tight-lipped folks in defense and intelligence departments, whose jobs could very well be on the chopping block anyways in Trump's administration, to just let it rip.\n\nDeclassify everything. Tell us the truth is out there. Then send Biden and Trump out to do a tag team Bill Pullman-Independence Day-esque speech, where they encourage us to not be consumed by our petty differences and instead be united in our common interests. Give us a new enemy!\n\nOr at the very least, declassify everything just to remind humans of our standing in the universe. I don't know who said it first but right now feels like a good time for everyone to remember that we\u2019re, \"just ghosts driving meat coated skeletons made from stardust riding a rock floating through space.\"\n\nKristin Brey is the \"My Take\" columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: House committee answers questions we've long had about ET | Opinion"

Kosloski, the newly-appointed director of AARO, will testify Tuesday before a Senate subcommittee.\n\nAARO released its latest report analyzing more than 700 recent UFO cases last week.\n\nLess than a week ago, whistleblowers in Congress rekindled the notion that high levels of government are concealing evidence of nonhuman intelligent beings and the mystifying vehicles they pilot.\n\nNow, the leader of the Pentagon's office to investigate UFOs is set to provide congressional testimony of his own.\n\nThat agency, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO,) came under heavy fire last Wednesday when a quartet of witnesses appeared before a House committee for its latest foray into the topic of UFOs.\n\nMany sightings AARO has historically investigated are reported by military fighter pilots, some of whom have captured footage on jets' cockpit gun cameras of unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP. The acronym has come to be the government's preferred term for what is still largely known among the public as UFOs, both because it's less stigmatized and because it includes objects seen in not just the air, but the water.\n\nBut despite the Pentagon's recent shows of transparency, some of those who spoke out last week lambasted the military and intelligence agencies for what they see as unnecessary \u2013 and even dangerous \u2013 secrecy shrouding what is known about UAP. The hearing was rife with both criticisms of AARO's March UFO report, as well as accusations that the agency engages in disinformation campaigns to discredit sightings and those in the military who report them.\n\nOn the heels of that hearing, Jon T. Kosloski, the newly-appointed director of AARO, will testify Tuesday before a Senate subcommittee.\n\nHere's what to know about the hearing, and how to watch it.\n\nUFO hearing:Here are the biggest revelations Congress heard\n\nWhen is the Senate UFO hearing? How to watch\n\nKosloski will appear at 4:30 p.m. EST Tuesday to testify before a subcommittee of the Armed Services committee.\n\nInformation on the nature of the hearing is vague, indicating only that Senate subcommittee members will \"receive testimony on the activities of\" AARO.\n\nVideo of the hearing will be available on the committee's website.\n\nHouse heard from UFO whistleblowers last week\n\nNews of the upcoming Senate hearing comes amid the latest round of testimony last week in the halls of Congress about unexplained objects violating U.S. airspace and shadowy programs to recover and study downed craft.\n\nFormer military members and others have for years described witnessing or recording baffling objects in both the skies and waters maneuvering in ways they believed to be beyond known human technology.\n\nLast Wednesday, journalist Michael Shellenberger testified that sources had informed him that intelligence communities are in possession of numerous high-resolution photos and videos of the craft unlike any of the grainy imagery that has so far been declassified.\n\nOne witness, Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence official, described a decades-long international arms race to obtain and reverse-engineer the strange vehicles so governments can bolster their own technology. In corroborating much of the testimony Pentagon intelligence official David Grusch offered in July 2023, Elizondo also accused the Department of Defense of hiding its UFO programs from Congress while misappropriating funds to operate them.\n\nElizondo lambasted the intelligence community for its decades of \"excessive secrecy\" around UAP reports \u2013 \"all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe we as Americans can handle the truth and I also believe the world deserves the truth,\" he said.\n\nLegislators have spent the past year pushing for new laws that would boost UAP transparency, with one seeking to create a civilian reporting mechanism, and one directing the executive branch to declassify certain records. But elected officials and UAP transparency advocates say it hasn't been enough.\n\nWhat is AARO? Pentagon reports have found no evidence of aliens\n\nAs Elizondo made clear last week, laws regarding classified information constrained him and Grusch from publicly presenting hard evidence to support claims of a crash retrieval program, which the Pentagon has repeatedly denied exists.\n\nFor its part, the Pentagon has overseen AARO since its creation in 2022 and created a website in 2023 for the public to access declassified UFO information.\n\nAARO has also released a series of reports with findings on various UFO sightings, all of which end with the same conclusion: That no evidence has been found to suggest that unexplained sightings are extraterrestrial in nature.\n\nAstrophysicists, as well, have long cautioned that the absence of obvious natural explanations for UFOs doesn't make otherworldly ones likely.\n\nIn its most recent report released Thursday, a day after the congressional UFO hearing, AARO studied 757 reports of UAP between May 1, 2023 to June 1, 2024.\n\n\"There are definitely anomalies,\" Kosloski admitted at a briefing last week, adding, \"we have not been able to draw the link to extraterrestrial.\"\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo, USA TODAY\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

        "article_content": "Alan Wake 2 was the game that fully connected the entire Remedy universe, but it all started with Control. Set in The Oldest House, home of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), Jesse Faden became the new director as she used her transforming gun and powers to defeat the Hiss. A DLC chapter connected her with Alan Wake, and now another piece of DLC for Alan Wake 2 has shifted the focus back on the FBC. Control 2 is the next chapter of this dark and paranormal story unlike anything else on our list of upcoming video games. It will still be a while before we return to the world of altered items of objects of power, so thankfully we have games like Civilization VII and Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows to hold us over, but there\u2019s nothing that can scratch that specific itch Control did. This is our declassified document on everything we know about Control 2.\n\nIf you\u2019re still on the lookout for the best upcoming PS5 games, we\u2019ve got you covered there too.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nRelease speculation\n\nThere\u2019s no word on when Control 2 will launch as of now. The game was first officially announced at the end of 2022 when it was first entering production, but in October of 2023 revealed that the game was still only in its \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d stage. Based on that, we might not see Control 2 until 2026 or later.\n\nPlatforms\n\nRemedy games since Quantum Break have never been platform-exclusive and we don\u2019t anticipate that changing for Control 2. You should expect to see it on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC at least, but possibly Switch 2 as well.\n\nTrailers\n\nNo footage for Control 2 has been shared yet, but it sounds like Remedy may be ready to show us the game soon based on how much it is talking about it. Who we play as, where, and what we\u2019ll be doing is all up in the air.\n\nGameplay\n\nNews from our Capital Markets day: \ud83d\udd26 Alan Wake 2 has sold over 1.8M units\n\n\ud83d\udd3b Control Ultimate Edition will release on Mac February 12th, 2025\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Control 2 will be an action RPG\n\n\ud83c\udf81 Control will receive a free update in early 2025, unlocking some previously released content \ud83d\udd0e\u2026 pic.twitter.com/AX1jqpNTkt \u2014 Remedy Entertainment (@remedygames) November 19, 2024\n\nThe only concrete detail we know about Control 2\u2018s gameplay is that it will be an action RPG. This was revealed by Remedy Entertainment itself, which lines up with how the first game played. It will also have a budget of approximately $52.9 million. This is low for most modern games, but quite a bit more than the first game\u2019s $30 million budget.\n\nControl 2 will almost certainly still be a third-person shooter with various weapon modes, psychic powers, and skill trees. How Remedy expands on those elements or what it decides to add is yet to be seen.\n\nPreorder\n\nThere will be no preorder details until Control 2 has a solid release date. As soon as they are available, we will update this article."

        "article_content": "Donald Trump has chosen TV host Dr Oz to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nCelebrity heart surgeon Dr Mehmet Oz rose to prominence working on Oprah Winfrey's leading daytime television show before getting his own long-running series.\n\nBut how has he gone from TV personality to Donald Trump's choice for overseeing a massive government agency?\n\nThe 64-year-old, who started out as Professor of Surgery at Columbia University, became a household name during 13 seasons of The Dr Oz Show, which ran from 2009 to 2022.\n\nImage: Dr Oz during a TV appearance in 2012. Pic: AP\n\nHe was popular, though his promotion of alternative medicine, faith healing and various paranormal beliefs earned him criticism from a number of medical publications and physicians.\n\nThe critics accused him of blurring the lines between medical advice and advertising, failing to make clear to his audience just how closely he worked with the companies he pitched.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 11:20 Who will be in Trump's White House?\n\nDespite the controversy, Dr Oz's show was a hit and his net worth sat between $100m (\u00a379m) and $315m (\u00a3249m) in 2022, according to a federal financial disclosure he filed that year.\n\nBeyond being an Emmy-winning TV show host, he is also an author of New York Times bestsellers, radio talk show host, founder of a national nonprofit to educate teens about healthy habits, and self-styled ambassador for wellness.\n\nHe was also a regular Fox News commentator, and a champion of unproven treatments for COVID including hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug whose use against the disease was also backed by Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage: Dr Oz holding his Emmy for outstanding talk show host in 2016. Pic: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP\n\nHe became a fierce critic of Joe Biden's government during the COVID pandemic, challenging its policies on social media.\n\nMoving into politics\n\nDr Oz played a lesser part in the first Trump administration from 2016, when he was appointed to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition.\n\nBut it was in 2022, after his show concluded, when Dr Oz really transitioned into politics by running for US Senate as a Republican in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe campaign leaned heavily into his celebrity status, with his campaign logo almost identical to his TV show logo.\n\nImage: Mehmet Oz campaigning for Senate in 2022. Pic: AP\n\nDuring his campaign rallies, he would talk up his \"number one health show in the world,\" give the odd piece of medical advice to supporters and spend a lengthy amount of time signing autographs and posing for photos.\n\nFollowing a court battle that went all the way to the US Supreme Court, Dr Oz narrowly won the primary over Dave McCormick by 951 votes, becoming the Republican candidate, but lost to Democrat John Fetterman in the general election.\n\nHis relationship with Trump\n\nImage: Donald Trump stands behind Dr Oz during rally in 2022. Pic: Reuters\n\nThe surgeon has had a long, personal relationship with the president-elect spanning back to the early 2000s.\n\nHe said in an interview during his Senate campaign that the pair first met in 2004 or 2005, when Dr Oz asked Mr Trump to use his golf course for an event for his children's charity.\n\nMr Trump agreed and, after that, they saw each other intermittently at social events before Dr Oz interviewed him about his health during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMr Trump appeared on his show, where he also said his wife Melania was \"a big fan\" of the doctor.\n\nThe pair then worked together when Mr Trump won the election and put Dr Oz on the President's Council.\n\nThen in 2022, Mr Trump was integral to Dr Oz's push for Senate, giving him his eagerly sought-after endorsement.\n\nRead more:\n\nWho does Trump want in his top team?\n\nTrump and Musk watch shaky rocket launch\n\n\"Women, in particular, are drawn to Dr Oz for his advice and counsel. I have seen this many times over the years. They know him, believe in him, and trust him,\" Mr Trump said when he first backed him.\n\n\"You know when you're in television for 18 years, that's like a poll,\" added the billionaire, who himself starred on 14 seasons of The Apprentice US.\n\n\"That means people like you.\"\n\nWhat will his role be?\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate to take the role, Dr Oz would oversee Medicare, Medicaid, children's health insurance and the Affordable Care Act, better known as \"Obamacare\".\n\nThe programmes cover more than 160 million people, from new-borns to nursing home residents.\n\nCMS also plays a central role in the nation's $4.5trn health care economy, setting payment rates for hospitals, doctors, labs and other service providers.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\n\"Dr Oz will be a leader in incentivising disease prevention, so we get the best results in the world for every dollar we spend on healthcare in our great country,\" the president-elect said in a statement.\n\n\"He will also cut waste and fraud within our country's most expensive government agency, which is a third of our nation's healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire national budget.\"\n\nDr Oz said he was \"honoured\" to be nominated for the role and looked forward to \"serving my country to Make America Healthy Again\".\n\nHe, like all of Mr Trump's picks, must be questioned by members of the Senate before it votes on his appointment. Even with the Republicans in control, some of the picks could be blocked."

Museum of the Bible\n\nIt had reportedly adorned a private chapel in 230 AD that was reportedly the \u201cearliest known house of prayer,\u201d according to Gil Lin, the head of the Megiddo Regional Council.\n\nInscribed on the mosaic are Greek words, \u201cThe god-loving Akeptous has offered the table to God Jesus Christ as a memorial. Lin described this as the \u201cfirst physical proclamation of Jesus Christ as God,\u201d the Daily Mail reported.\n\n\u201cThe mosaic presents groundbreaking physical evidence of the practices and beliefs of early Christians, including the first archaeological instance of the phrase, \u2018God Jesus Christ,\u2019 seconded the exhibition\u2019s curator Alegre Savariego.\n\nThis was significant as the artifact declared JC as God before Christianity became part of the Roman empire, JNS reported.\n\n3 The mosaic included an image of a fish, one of the signature symbols of Jesus Christ. Museum of the Bible\n\nMegiddo, which was designed by a craftsman named Brutus, also features some of the earliest depictions of fish, one of the trademark symbols of the messiah in Christian theology.\n\n3 Dr. Adolfo Roitman presents a part of the Isaiah Scroll, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, inside the vault of the Shrine of the Book building at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem on Monday, Sept. 26, 2011. AP\n\nIn the gospel of Luke 9:16 in the Bible, Jesus notably multiplied two fish and several loaves of bread to feed 5,000 people.\n\nAlso included was a reference to Gaianus, the Roman officer who commissioned the tile during the Roman occupation of Judea.\n\nThis, along with the mosaic\u2019s proximity to a Roman camp, suggested that Romans coexisted with Christians to some degree despite the notorious tales of bloodshed and violence involving the two factions.\n\n\u201cThis is arguably one of the most important archaeological discoveries for understanding the early Christian church,\u201d said Bobby Duke, director of the Scholars Initiative at the Museum of the Bible. \u201cTruly, the mosaic presents a wealth of new data for church historians.\u201d\n\nTo wit, the piece includes the names of five women: Primilla, Cyriaca, Dorothea, Chreste, and Akeptous, the latter of whom was shouted out for donating a table to the prayer hall.\n\n\u201cThe mosaic underscores the crucial role of women in the early church,\u201d deduced Duke.\n\nAfter the Museum Of The Bible\u2019s exhibition concludes in July 2025, the hallowed floor decor will return to Israel, where it will be showcased at the exact site where it was exhumed."

        "article_content": "Starting a business is exciting, but let\u2019s be honest\u2014it\u2019s also expensive. From hiring developers to setting up systems, costs can quickly add up, leaving little room for experimentation. But here\u2019s the good news: no-code tools are rewriting the rules of entrepreneurship. They allow you to build apps, automate processes, and test ideas without breaking the bank.\n\nYou no longer need to rely on expensive developers or wait months to bring your vision to life. No-code strategies empower you to create and grow your business while keeping costs low. In this article, I\u2019ll share how you can leverage no-code tools to cut startup costs, streamline operations, and make every dollar count.\n\nWhy Cutting Costs Matters for Startups\n\nEvery startup faces the challenge of doing more with less. When you\u2019re just starting out, funds are often limited, and you need to allocate them wisely. Cutting costs isn\u2019t just about saving money\u2014it\u2019s about giving your business room to grow without unnecessary financial stress.\n\nWith no-code tools, you can avoid hiring full development teams, reduce software expenses, and speed up your go-to-market strategy. Imagine being able to build a functioning product or automate a workflow in days rather than months, all at a fraction of the cost.\n\n1. Use No-Code Tools to Build Your MVP\n\nYour Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the first version of your product, designed to test your idea with real users. Traditionally, building an MVP required a team of developers and thousands of dollars. No-code tools have changed the game.\n\nPlatforms like Bubble, Webflow, and Glide let you build fully functional apps and websites without any coding knowledge. You can design, test, and launch your product in weeks instead of months, saving significant development costs.\n\nExample:\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to launch an ecommerce store. Using Webflow, you can create a visually stunning and functional website without hiring a web developer. Need a mobile app for your store? Tools like Glide or Adalo make it possible.\n\nCheck out this no code tools directory to explore platforms that fit your needs.\n\n2. Automate Repetitive Tasks to Save Time and Money\n\nRepetitive tasks like sending follow-up emails, updating spreadsheets, or managing customer support can eat up your time. Hiring people to handle these tasks can also strain your budget. No-code automation tools like Zapier and Make (formerly Integromat) help you streamline these processes.\n\nFor instance, you can automate:\n\nSending a welcome email to new subscribers.\n\nAdding leads from forms to your CRM.\n\nUpdating inventory levels across platforms.\n\nAutomation not only saves money but also frees up your time to focus on scaling your business. You don\u2019t have to manage everything manually when these tools work in the background.\n\n3. Create Marketing Assets Without Hiring Designers\n\nProfessional design services can be expensive, especially for startups on a budget. No-code tools like Canva and Visme let you create stunning graphics, social media posts, and presentations without needing a designer. These platforms offer templates and drag-and-drop interfaces that make designing simple.\n\nExample:\n\nIf you\u2019re promoting your business on Instagram, Canva allows you to create eye-catching posts and stories that stand out. With no additional cost, you can maintain a professional online presence and attract more customers.\n\nFor entrepreneurs exploring best side business ideas for entrepreneurs, using design tools like Canva can also help build your brand with minimal investment.\n\n4. Streamline Customer Management with No-Code CRM Tools\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) is crucial for any business, but traditional CRM software can be expensive. No-code CRMs like Airtable and Notion allow you to manage your customer data, track interactions, and even automate follow-ups\u2014all on a budget.\n\nHow to Use No-Code CRMs:\n\nTrack sales leads and conversations in Airtable.\n\nUse Notion to create a centralized hub for client details and project updates.\n\nAutomate lead assignment and notifications with Zapier integrations.\n\nThese tools give you the functionality of big-name CRMs without the hefty price tag.\n\n5. Test and Scale Business Ideas Without High Costs\n\nOne of the biggest challenges entrepreneurs face is testing business ideas quickly without wasting money. With no-code tools, you can experiment with different ideas and pivot when needed, all without draining your budget.\n\nFor example:\n\nBuild a prototype of your app using Bubble.\n\nSet up a landing page to validate your idea with Webflow.\n\nUse Glide to create a mobile app for testing a new service.\n\nNo-code tools give you the flexibility to adapt your business strategy based on feedback. This agility can save you from costly mistakes and help you focus on what works.\n\n6. Reduce Software Expenses with Free and Low-Cost No-Code Tools\n\nInstead of investing in multiple expensive tools, you can use no-code platforms that offer free or low-cost plans. Many tools provide all the functionality you need at an affordable price, especially when you\u2019re just starting out.\n\nTool Purpose Starting Price Bubble App development $25/month Zapier Workflow automation Free (limited) Canva Graphic design Free (with pro options) Airtable CRM and databases Free\n\nBy choosing the right tools, you can reduce overhead while maintaining the quality and efficiency of your operations.\n\n7. Work with No-Code Agencies for Complex Projects\n\nWhile no-code tools empower you to build on your own, there are times when you might need expert guidance, especially for more complex projects. A Zeroqode is top No code Agency that can help you bring your ideas to life faster and more efficiently than traditional development teams.\n\nFor instance, if you want to create a custom app with advanced functionality, a no-code agency can save you time and money by delivering a professional solution tailored to your needs.\n\n8.
