        "article_content": "An office in the Pentagon investigated UFOs\u2014and the paranormal\u2014over a decade ago, segueing into a long saga leading to Congressional hearings and breathless news stories today. But the real story looks more like former defense officials pushing their personal mythology, rather than any cover-up of aliens\n\nAfter a long hiatus of systematic U.S. government\u2013affiliated investigations into UFOs, a Pentagon office quietly resumed such efforts in 2008. Called the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (AAWSAP), it was funded to the tune of $22 million in total. The life\u2014and cancellation four years later\u2014of this Defense Intelligence Agency program has featured in congressional hearings, UFO \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claims and renewed public uproar about aliens. But the real story is more sordid than sensational.\n\nIn 2022 the U.S. Department of Defense established the brand-new and separate All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to investigate military reports of UFOs, now called unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP. Currently AARO offers a unique chance for the government to get this UFO thing right once and for all\u2014but not in quite the way that more hard-line alien believers might wish.\n\nThe new office has its hands full. Last year congressional hearings heard claims of alien technology recoveries and a supposed decades-long cover-up of ET\u2019s presence on Earth. Such assertions fill the new book Imminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt for UFOs, by former military counterintelligence officer Luis Elizondo, attracting renewed notice among podcasters and serious news outlets alike.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nInvestigating these unverifiable fables about aliens should be scrapped as a fool\u2019s errand for AARO, which earlier this year released a historical review demolishing this long-running conspiracy theory. The office\u2019s real value, from a technical standpoint, lies in resolving UFO sighting reports with the very latest technology and tools, supplementing time-honored fact-checking and investigation, and showing how UFOs can be tracked and resolved in real time using high-tech sensors, rather than relying on the suboptimal witness testimonials that fill bookshelves and cable-news specials.\n\nGovernment-themed conspiracy theories have been part of the UFO milieu for decades, but recent testimonies by \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d to congressional committees have given these accounts a hitherto unparalleled air of authenticity. Far from being a scientific sea change, however, as longtime scholars of UFO claims we regard them as having elements closer to religion, with the same core group of advocates\u2014including some former AAWSAP insiders\u2014pushing the \u201cnonhuman intelligence\u201d narrative of hidden aliens or interdimensional beings.\n\nAAWSAP was officially meant to research future aerospace threats but was a de facto UFO/paranormal investigation effort, a fact affirmed in the AARO historical report. Controversy has surrounded the office since the publication of a credulous 2017 New York Times article identified it by the moniker \u201cAdvanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program\u201d (AATIP). The acronym soup confusion regarding the name has been exacerbated by Elizondo, who co-opted the AATIP label for his own, informal follow-on effort at the Pentagon after AAWSAP\u2019s termination in 2012.\n\nAAWSAP\u2019s output included 38 \u201cDefense Intelligence Reference Documents\u201d produced by scientists contracted by mogul and UFO enthusiast Robert Bigelow, along with other reports described in two books. The latter reports reference as-yet unreleased databases of international UFO cases, investigations and findings from the \u201cspooky\u201d Skinwalker Ranch in Utah once owned by Bigelow, and monthly reports supposedly delivered to the DIA, along with a 494-page \u201c10 Month Report\u201d replete with charts, graphs and findings. There are good reasons to harbor doubts about these reports\u2019 quality and objectivity.\n\nElizondo\u2019s effort, despite his countless mass media and podcast appearances, has yielded no publicly accessed findings or deliverables proving any claims about a UFO cover-up. These may come to light, but \u201cAARO assesses that the inaccurate claim that the USG [U.S. government] is reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology and is hiding it from Congress is, in large part, the result of circular reporting from a group of individuals who believe this to be the case, despite a lack of evidence,\u201d that office concluded in its recent report.\n\nThis entire saga shows how pseudoscientific thinking can metastasize in a positive feedback loop, ensnaring not only scientists with paranormal inclinations but also government officials. This was bemoaned by the former head of AARO, Sean Kirkpatrick, who remarked that these officials are tasked with matters of national urgency\u2014a responsibility necessitating a mindset committed to objective investigation and analysis. Some of these officials are on the record casting AARO as part of the \u201ccover-up.\u201d Indeed, the UFO belief system has long ago morphed into a type of faith requiring no evidence.\n\nThe fact that officials harboring evidence-deficient beliefs regarding extraterrestrials and \u201chigh strangeness\u201d (a term first popularized in the early 1970s by ufologists to describe certain bizarre and seemingly absurd elements of some UFO and \u201calien\u201d encounters) are entrusted with national security matters should give one pause. America\u2019s adversaries, to the extent that they are paying attention to the UFO mess, might well regard it as yet another avenue to undermine American institutions\u2014somewhat reflecting a CIA panel\u2019s 1953 warning about potential Soviet exploitation of the genre.\n\nOn a more positive note, ufology is now in vogue among historians keen to understand the mythical nature of the problem and how it relates to historical waves of aerial phenomena reports. Because of how modern media, and especially now digital media, magnify the voices of breathless advocates, sundry frauds and scientists with a penchant for the paranormal, the UFO phenomenon from 1947 onward has acquired much greater gravitas than prior scares and waves, some of which predate it by centuries.\n\nMany serious people dismiss UFOs as a fringe interest or a pop culture distraction. Yes, they are. Yet we maintain, along with an increasing number of scholars, that there is much to be learned from studying UFO sightings, flaps and waves. While our own view is that UFOs, or UAP, emphatically do not represent any truly anomalous physical phenomena such as an extraterrestrial presence, this nevertheless does not consign ufology to insignificance. We should explore its meaning rather than ceding it to sensationalistic advocates employing shoddy methodologies and pushing quasi-religious, otherworldly stories. AARO and academia are thus tasked with an important responsibility that could yield original and fascinating developments into how and why people interpret and react to things they see in the sky.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

Earlier this month, it was reported that the Senate Armed Services Committee is looking to hold a UFO hearing after the elections in November.\n\nThe doc, narrated by Peter Coyote, will include extensive interviews with insiders, experts and politicians. Christopher Mellon, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, and Stanford University\u2019s Dr. Gary Nolan, will be among those who appear in the doc. Also set are Jason Sands, a master sergeant in the United States Air Force; Craig Lindsay, formerly of Scotland\u2019s Royal Air Force Office; and Nick Pope, formerly of the U.K.\u2019s Ministry of Defense. Among others, Andre Carson, Sen. Harry Reid and Rep. Tim Burchett are interviewed, along with Kirk McConnell, who previously held a position in Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nFox and Lance Mungia produced the doc, with Jim Martin and Henry Marx of Lab 9 Films executive producing. Verve Ventures is handling sales, with the doc set to screen for buyers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been making films on the topic of UFOs (now referred to as UAP) since the early 1990s. I never thought I\u2019d live to see the day when high level military officials would testify under oath to a bipartisan group of lawmakers that the United States government has been hiding definitive proof that we are not alone. The program lays out a very compelling case that disclosure is upon us,\u201d said Fox, who was behind previous docs The Phenomenon and Moment of Contact.\n\nAdded Martin and Marx: \u201cWe are thrilled to bring James Fox\u2019s most powerful work, The Program, to the widest possible audience. This film is banging on the door of UFO disclosure, demanding the attention and conversation it deserves.\u201d\n\nThe conversation about UFOs/UAPs is heating up as top officials continue to share their stories. Recently, Jay Stratton, the former director of the U.S. government\u2019s secretive Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, struck a memoir deal with HarperCollins. Last month, Luis Elizondo \u2014 the former head of the Pentagon\u2019s program investigating UFOs/ UAPs \u2014 released the book Imminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt for UFOs, which became a New York Times best-seller."

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nWith more enterprises looking to build more AI applications or even AI agents, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that organizations should use different language models and databases to get the best results.\n\nHowever, switching an application from Llama 3 to Mistral in a flash may take a bit of technology infrastructure finesse. This is where the context and orchestration layer comes in; the so-called middle layer that connects foundation models to applications will ideally control the traffic of API calls to models to execute tasks.\n\nThe middle layer mainly consists of software like LangChain or LlamaIndex that help bridge databases, but the question is, will the middle layer solely consist of software, or is there a role hardware can still play here beyond powering much of the models that power AI applications in the first place.\n\nThe answer is that hardware\u2019s role is to support frameworks like LangChain and the databases that bring applications to life. Enterprises need to have hardware stacks that can handle massive data flows and even look at devices that can do a lot of data center work on device.\n\n>>Don\u2019t miss our special issue: Fit for Purpose: Tailoring AI Infrastructure.<<\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s true that the AI middle layer is primarily a software concern, hardware providers can significantly impact its performance and efficiency,\u201d said Scott Gnau, head of data platforms at data management company InterSystems.\n\nMany AI infrastructure experts told VentureBeat that while software underpins AI orchestration, none would work if the servers and GPUs could not handle massive data movement.\n\nIn other words, for the software AI orchestration layer to work, the hardware layer needs to be smart and efficient, focusing on high-bandwidth, low-latency connections to data and models to handle heavy workloads.\n\n\u201cThis model orchestration layer needs to be backed with fast chips,\u201d said Matt Candy, managing partner of generative AI at IBM Consulting, in an interview. \u201cI could see a world where the silicon/chips/servers are able to optimize based on the type and size of the model being used for different tasks as the orchestration layer is switching between them.\u201d\n\nCurrent GPUs, if you have access, will already work\n\nJohn Roese, global CTO and chief AI officer at Dell, told VentureBeat that hardware like the ones Dell makes still has a role in this middle layer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s both a hardware and software issue because the thing people forget about AI is that it appears as software,\u201d Roese said. \u201cSoftware always runs on hardware, and AI software is the most demanding we\u2019ve ever built, so you have to understand the performance layer of where are the MIPs, where is the compute to make these things work properly.\u201d\n\nThis AI middle layer may need fast, powerful hardware, but there is no need for new specialized hardware beyond the GPUs and other chips currently available.\n\n\u201cCertainly, hardware is a key enabler, but I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s specialized hardware that would really move it forward, other than the GPUs that make the models run faster, Gnau said. \u201cI think software and architecture are where you can optimize in a kind fabric-y way the ability to minimize data movement.\u201d\n\nAI agents make AI orchestration even more important\n\nThe rise of AI agents has made strengthening the middle layer even more critical. When AI agents start talking to other agents and doing multiple API calls, the orchestration layer directs that traffic and fast servers are crucial.\n\n\u201cThis layer also provides seamless API access to all of the different types of AI models and technology and a seamless user experience layer that wraps around them all,\u201d said IBM\u2019s Candy. \u201cI call it an AI controller in this middleware stack.\u201d\n\nAI agents are the current hot topic for the industry, and they will likely influence how enterprises build a lot of their AI infrastructure going forward.\n\nRoese added another thing enterprises need to consider: on-device AI, another hot topic in the space. He said companies will want to imagine when their AI agents will need to run locally because the old internet may go down.\n\n\u201cThe second thing to consider is where do you run?\u201d Roese said. \u201cThat\u2019s where things like the AI PC comes into play because the minute I have a collection of agents working on my behalf and they can talk to each other, do they all have to be in the same place.\u201d\n\nHe added Dell explored the possibility of adding \u201cconcierge\u201d agents on device \u201cso if you\u2019re ever disconnected from the internet, you can continue doing your job.\u201d\n\nExplosion of the tech stack now, but not always\n\nGenerative AI has allowed the expansion of the tech stack, as more tasks became more abstracted, bringing new service providers offering GPU space, new databases or AIOps services. This won\u2019t be the case forever, said Uniphore CEO Umesh Sachdev, and enterprises must remember that.\n\n\u201cThe tech stack has exploded, but I do think we\u2019re going to see it normalize,\u201d said Sachdev. \u201cEventually, people will bring things in-house and the capacity demand in GPUs will ease out. The layer and vendor explosion always happens with new technologies and we\u2019re going to see the same with AI.\u201d\n\nFor enterprises, it\u2019s clear that thinking about the entire AI ecosystem, from software to hardware, is the best practice for AI workflows that make sense."

        "article_content": "Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and C3.ai (NYSE: AI) represent two very different ways to invest in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market. Oracle is one of the world's largest database software providers, so it hosts a lot of the data that needs to be crunched by AI applications. Its cloud infrastructure platform also provides the computing power and storage to run many of those AI applications and other cloud-based applications. C3.ai is a smaller developer of AI algorithms which can be plugged into an organization's existing software to accelerate, automate, and optimize certain tasks.\n\nC3.ai's founder and CEO Tom Siebel previously founded Siebel Systems, a sales automation software provider that Oracle acquired for $5.85 billion in 2006. Siebel founded C3.ai in 2009, and that new AI company went public in Dec. 2020.\n\nAn android works on a laptop computer.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nC3.ai is growing a lot faster than Oracle. But over the past three years, C3's stock declined about 50% and trades at a 45% discount to its IPO price. Oracle's stock rallied nearly 90% during the same period. Let's see why the blue-chip tech giant outperformed the high-growth newcomer -- and if it will remain the more attractive investment for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe differences between Oracle and C3.ai\n\nOver the past decade, Oracle transformed a lot of its on-site database appliances and software into cloud-based services. It also expanded that cloud-based ecosystem with more enterprise resource planning (ERP) and cloud infrastructure services.\n\nA lot of that growth was driven by dozens of acquisitions -- including the data broker Datalogix, the ERP leader NetSuite, the cloud-based constructing management company Aconex, and the healthcare IT giant Cerner. That expansion transformed Oracle into a more diversified cloud software company and reduced its dependence on its slower-growth on-premise services.\n\nC3.ai has a much narrower focus. Over the years, the company was previously known as C3 Energy and C3 IoT (Internet of Things) before it shrewdly rebranded itself as C3.ai. But each interation of that company still peddled the same machine learning and AI algorithms, which can either be plugged into an organization's software or accessed as stand-alone modules.\n\nC3.ai primarily serves large customers across the energy, industrial, financial, and government sectors. However, it generates more than 30% of its revenue from a joint venture with the energy giant Baker Hughes (NASDAQ: BKR). That crucial deal, which will expire by the end of fiscal 2025 (April 2025), hasn't been renewed yet.\n\nOracle is firmly profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but its non-GAAP earnings generally paint a clearer picture of its growth without the near-term noise from its acquisitions, investments, and stock-based compensation. C3.ai is still deeply unprofitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP measures.\n\nWhich company is growing faster?\n\nFrom fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this May), Oracle's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% as its GAAP EPS increased at a CAGR of 5%.\n\nMost of that growth was driven by the cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platforms which accounted for 42% of its top line in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. It expects its growth in IaaS revenue, which already surged 50% in fiscal 2024, to accelerate again in fiscal 2025 as the AI market expands. It also repurchased about 6% of its shares over the past four years.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Oracle's revenue and GAAP EPS to grow at a CAGR of 12% and 21%, respectively. Its stock isn't exactly a bargain at 31 times next year's GAAP earnings, but it looks a bit more reasonably valued at 26 times its forward non-GAAP earnings. It also pays a forward dividend yield of nearly 1%.\n\nC3 is growing a lot faster. From fiscal 2020 to 2024, its revenue grew at a CAGR of 19%. Analysts expect its revenue to climb at a CAGR of 20% from fiscal 2024 to 2027.\n\nThat top-line growth seems stable, but C3 expects to stay unprofitable for at least the next few years as it ramps up its spending on new generative AI tools. That means it won't prioritize buybacks or pay dividends anytime soon. It's also too heavily dependent on Baker Hughes, and it's been gradually cannibalizing its higher-value subscriptions with its lower usage-based fees to gain new customers. Its stock also doesn't look like a screaming bargain at six times next year's sales.\n\nThe obvious winner: Oracle\n\nOracle isn't a high-growth tech stock, but its broad diversification, stable profits, and reasonable valuation make it a much healthier investment than C3.\n\nC3 isn't doomed yet, but it needs to renew its partnership with Baker Hughes, resolve those customer concentration issues, and meaningfully narrow its losses before it impresses the bulls again. C3 might have the catchier ticker symbol, but Oracle is definitely a more balanced play on the growing AI market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "article_content": "15 years ago, this movie took the world by surprise \u2026 and scared everyone who saw it\n\nFifteen years ago, on September 25, 2009, Paranormal Activity was released in theaters and scared the pants out of audiences everywhere. Even before the movie\u2019s premiere, it had already become legendary. Instead of debuting via a massive theatrical release rollout, the micro-budgeted movie was screened in college towns across the country to drum up word of mouth.\n\nIt worked. Thanks to the (somewhat still new) popularity of Facebook and the prominence of texting on phones, Paranormal Activity didn\u2019t need a marketing campaign. Frightened audiences told everyone they knew about the scary movie they just watched. Soon, the internet was ablaze with word of this new movie that didn\u2019t have stars anyone had heard of before.\n\nThe birth of a new horror franchise\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nFilmed in the found-footage style, the movie centers around a young couple, Micah and Katie, who are determined to capture the paranormal activity happening in their house. But it\u2019s not just a ghost that\u2019s haunting them, it\u2019s a demon. Even worse, the more attention they give to it, the stronger and more active it becomes.\n\nParamount realized Paranormal Activity was destined to become a hit and picked it up for wide distribution. When the movie finally premiered in theaters across the country, audiences were terrified. When speaking to Empire, Jordan Peele recounted his experience seeing the movie in theaters. \u201cWhen the s*** hit the fan, Katie is dragged out of the room screaming. The audience absolutely lost it,\u201d the horror icon said.\n\nSince then, Paranormal Activity has received six sequels and has become one of the most prominent examples of found-footage movies ever. It\u2019s also just as scary as it was in 2009, and aside from the dated use of the camcorder, it still looks and feels terrifying.\n\nParanormal Activity was genuinely scary to a desensitized audience\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nPeele isn\u2019t the only one who was horrified by Paranormal Activity. In 2009 Roger Ebert even gave the movie 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying, \u201cIt illustrates one of my favorite points, that silence and waiting can be more entertaining than frantic fast-cutting and berserk f/x.\u201d\n\nThe movie was so scary that its trailers even used audience footage from its screenings to show how horrified moviegoers were. By the end of its box office run, Paranormal Activity had raked in over $193 million.\n\nSimilarly to The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity gets a lot of its horror from what audiences don\u2019t see. Strange sounds and small movements captured by the camera seem trivial, but when the movie\u2019s pacing is flawless, each small instance can feel monumental and the anticipation that builds between them is undeniable.\n\nAs the movie continues, the stakes get higher and the hauntings more intense. But the film never uses special effects or has some haggard-looking ghost running around. Even its \u201cbig moments\u201d are subtle compared to other horror movies. For example, at one point Micah scatters baby powder around the floor to see if something really is walking through their house at night. When he turns the lights on, the prints left behind look like some kind of lizard or bird.\n\nEven as someone who doesn\u2019t believe in the paranormal, this movie still gets to me. It utilizes our natural fears, like being in a big, empty, dark house at night \u2014 and then hearing a strange sound in the hallway.\n\nBut the movie definitely requires some patience. If you like being scared by CGI-generated monsters and loud musical cues, then this probably isn\u2019t the movie for you. But if you turn off all the lights in a quiet room late at night and watch Paranormal Activity, you will discover just how horrifying it is.\n\nParanormal Activity ushered in the paranormal horror era\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nThe success of Paranormal Activity was so massive it created a sea change in the horror genre. When the film premiered initially in 2007 and then had its full release in 2009, horror was in its full-blown \u201ctorture porn\u201d phase, where filmmakers were doing everything they could to have the goriest and grossest torture movie possible. The Saw franchise, Hostel, and The Hills Have Eyes reboots were proving to be box office hits, and The Human Centipede had just made its debut at FrightFest.\n\nBut after Paranormal Activity outgrossed all those movies (Saw II for example was the highest-grossing Saw film, making just under $148 million, which was $40 million less than Paranormal Activity), Hollywood realized a new horror trend may have just emerged. The torture porn trend ended almost immediately after Paranormal Activity, and by the following year, the paranormal era was hitting high gear and gore was gone.\n\nAfter Paranormal Activity, more paranormal horror films followed, including numerous Paranormal Activity sequels, as well as Insidious and The Conjuring, both of which would spawn their own massive franchises. There was also a wave of other low-budget found-footage paranormal movies that, while never making a huge splash, became notable hits within the horror community, like Hell House LLC, Grave Encounters, and The Taking of Deborah Logan.\n\nNow could be the perfect time for a new Paranormal Activity\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nParanormal Activity was made and released during a period of massive change. Social media had just become a widely used tool by society, and smartphones had just started rolling out to the general public.\n\nNew technology that wasn\u2019t around at the time of its release could be used to make a really fun modern Paranormal Activity sequel or reboot. Between Nest cams, doorbell cameras, smartphones, drones, and even dashcams, there are so many new tools that could be used to reinvent the found-footage genre and add new touches.\n\nThe streaming era could also be helpful, since studios don\u2019t need to invest as much money into theatrical releases and instead can release low-budget movies on their streaming platforms for much less investment. With how cheap the Paranormal Activity movies are to make, they could be perfect for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Shudder, or even Tubi.\n\nAnother reason why now could be the perfect time for a new Paranormal Activity movie is that belief in the paranormal has actually risen in recent years. There\u2019s a lot of really touchy topics that have probably caused this \u2014 largely America\u2019s regression into fanaticism and conspiratorial thinking \u2014 but modern studies have shown some shocking results. In 2021, it was reported that 57% of Americans believe in ghosts, and in 2023 another study revealed that over half of Americans think they\u2019ve actually been visited by a ghost.\n\nThese findings might make some of us question our fellow Americans and their belief systems, but for Hollywood and anyone wanting to make a paranormal movie to scare the crap out of people\u2026now seems to be the perfect time.\n\nYou can watch Paranormal Activity on Max."

        "article_content": "Church attendance has sharply declined, and the number of people who express interest in religion is decreasing. Vermont, New Hampshire, Washington, Oregon, and Maine reported the lowest percentage of adults who say they attend church or religious services. The biggest drop in attendance in the past 20 years has been amongst U.S. Catholics.\n\nAt the same time, belief in the paranormal is becoming more common. Seventy-five percent of us believe in the paranormal and about 20 percent of Americans claim that they have actually seen a ghost. Research suggests that both belief in the paranormal and religiosity are characterized by similar brain states that also underlie anxiety, proneness to suggestion and fantasy, and limited critical thinking.\n\nWhy are atheism and belief in the paranormal becoming increasingly popular? Is the human brain evolving away from one form of fantasy beliefs while embracing another? Possibly, but it is impossible to ignore the fact that religious beliefs and acceptance of the paranormal have been a durable feature of the world\u2019s cultures for many millennia. Anthropologists estimate that at least 18,000 different gods, goddesses, and various animals or objects have been worshiped by humans since our species first appeared. Evolution has clearly selected for a brain that has the ability to accept a logically absurd world of supernatural causes and beings.\n\nRecent studies have investigated which resting state brain circuits and which frequency states are utilized by skeptical nonbelievers as compared to believers. Previous studies have demonstrated that a resting state analysis is objective, stable, and capable of revealing individual differences in how the brain functions. Essentially, the analysis provides a kind of \"neural fingerprint\" of which brain regions are involved in the processing of emotions, memories, and thoughts. The believers studied were Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, or other.\n\nNot believing in a god is due to the activation of distinct higher-order brain networks.\n\nThe results demonstrated that religious believers are more likely to use more intuitive and heuristic reasoning and that religious nonbelievers are more likely to use more deliberative and analytic reasoning. For example, nonbelievers are more likely to process sensory information, such as something they see, in a more deliberative manner that involves higher cortical areas, called top-down processing, involved in reasoning. In contrast, religious believers are more likely to interpret visual information in a more emotional or intuitive manner, called bottom-up processing, that involves more ancient brain systems. Religious believers share this bottom-up processing bias with people who believe in the supernatural or paranormal activity, such as telekinesis or clairvoyance. Recent evidence suggests that religious fundamentalists have a network of brain regions located in the right hemisphere that may be damaged by injury or simply inherited.\n\nParanormal believers' thinking is frequently biased by intuitive beliefs. An analysis of brain states showed that paranormal belief is related to the reduced power of the alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands, all indicative of a reduced level of inhibitory control and critical analysis of incoming sensory information. (To learn more about alpha and beta waves, go here.)\n\nThe increase in the number of religious nonbelievers and paranormal believers may be in response to shifts in our culture as well as more accurate scientific explanations for natural phenomena that once depended on the intervention of mythical beings. The shift may indicate that our brain requires some form of fantasy belief and that gods are simply being replaced by ghosts."

        "article_content": "For uncovering how a cell population helps ensure food, liquid and acid reflux are kept out of our airway \u2013 and instead sent to our GI tract \u2013 Laura Seeholzer is the winner of the 2024 Eppendorf & Science Prize for Neurobiology. Her findings, detailed in April in Science, have motivated her to study what\u2019s happening with these cells in diseases where this critical protective reflex is compromised.\n\n\u201cThese findings are crucial for understanding potentially life-saving reflexes that are activated in the airway, in response to noxious stimuli,\u201d said Peter Stern, Senior Editor at Science, who oversaw the prize.\n\nFor most every breath we take and most every morsel or sip we consume, the lungs are protected. Air enters the lungs, but food, liquid and stomach acid are sent to the GI tract.\n\nIn a flash, however, this process can go wrong \u2013 a foreign agent can get into our airway. This can cause discomfort, at minimum. And at worst it can lead to airway blockage, acid-induced lung damage, or aspiration pneumonia \u2013 outcomes that occur frequently in people with neurological or esophageal disorders and which are a leading cause of aspiration pneumonia and mortality in older people.\n\nScientists already know that sensory systems in the upper airway, namely the larynx and trachea, rapidly detect the things that we need to exclude from our lungs. Innervated with sensory nerve fibers, the larynx and trachea respond to foreign agents \u2013 and clear them.\n\nBut scientists don\u2019t know if the nerve fibers in the larynx and trachea act alone.\n\nSeeholzer\u2019s work uncovered another entity \u2013 neuroendocrine cells \u2013 that operate in the larynx and trachea, to play a protective role. In her prize essay, \u201c(Don\u2019t) take my breath away,\u201d Seeholzer \u2013 a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California San Francisco \u2013 writes, \u201cyou should thank your neuroendocrine cells the next time you clear water or acid reflux out of your airway.\u201d\n\nNeuroendocrine (NE) cells are a rare group of epithelial cells throughout the larynx and trachea. They have been understood for their important role in repairing the airway epithelium after injury.\n\nThey had not been thought to be involved in airway protection.\n\nHowever, because these cells are near sensory nerve fibers, Seeholzer and her colleagues speculated that they could be specialized sensory cells that play a role in protecting our lungs.\n\nSeeholzer said she wasn\u2019t even sure there were NE cells in the trachea and larynx when she started her work. \u201cI started from the ground up, learning how these cells operate. I then used that to generate a hypothesis about their importance in the airway.\u201d\n\nHer efforts involved work in cells and in mice \u2013 and methods including calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and optogenetics.\n\nThe road wasn\u2019t always easy.\n\n\u201cI had been studying NE cells for a year or two to figure out what they detect, which could inform what they do,\u201d said Seeholzer. \u201cI performed a sequencing experiment to see what the cells expressed. When I looked at the data, not many receptors were expressed that supported my hypothesis that these were sensory cells that could detect stimuli that could get into the airway. The sequencing led to all dead ends.\u201d\n\nSeeholzer did not give up, however. She spoke with David Julius, her mentor, and professor and chair of physiology at UCSF. She explained her sequencing work was not revealing what NE cells detected. \u201cHe encouraged me to step back and think about what they could be detecting, and to use that to nominate substances the NE cells could be frequently exposed to.\u201d\n\nThat led to an \u201cah-hah!\u201d moment she describes in her essay, where she changed how she set up her experiments. As a result, she discovered that water and strong acid solutions (like stomach acid) very consistently activated the NE cells.\n\nShe then sought to understand what the water and acid did to the cells. Using optogenetic techniques, she could specifically activate NE cells in mice. \u201cWhen I did that, the mice started swallowing very quickly.\u201d Seeholzer attached a device to the mice to study related changes in breathing. \u201cI very consistently saw that activating NE cells led to swallows and to cough-like reflexes.\u201d That supported her hypothesis that NE cells were detecting water and acid to elicit protective responses in the airway, to keep foreign substances out.\n\nShe says NE cells add another layer \u2013 on top of sensory neurons researchers have previously studied \u2013 giving full protection in the airway. This was further evidenced by experiments in mice in which the NE cells were knocked out; this led to the airway not being fully protected against foreign threats.\n\nNow having done work in mice, Seeholzer wants to understand how these cells operate in healthy and diseased humans. Her findings suggest these cells are not functioning properly in people with dysphagia, which is the inability to swallow well \u2013 a major cause of mortality. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in looking at patients who aspirate frequently to see if there\u2019s something going on with cells there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m interested in looking at what happens with these cells in people who smoke, where dysphagia is also more prevalent.\u201d\n\nThere are also implications for people with refractory chronic cough, where the NE cells may be hyperactivated.\n\n\u201cEppendorf and the journal Science have been awarding this prestigious prize since 2002,\u201d said Axel Jahns, Vice President of Corporate Citizenship & Governmental Affairs at Eppendorf SE. \u201cSince its initiation, the prize has acknowledged over 70 winners and finalists, who have gone on to become leading scientists in their field. Congratulations to Dr. Seeholzer on her amazing achievement in winning this year.\u201d\n\nSeeholzer expressed how her supportive lab environment made it possible to achieve the findings she did, even after significant obstacles. \u201cThe lab I\u2019m in really made all the work fun and enjoyable,\u201d she said.\n\nFinalists\n\nRosemary J. Cater is a finalist for the prize, for her essay, \u201cFood for thought.\u201d Cater received her undergraduate degree and PhD from The University of Sydney. After completing her postdoctoral fellowship at Columbia University, she started her laboratory at the University of Queensland\u2019s Institute for Molecular Bioscience in 2024. Her research uses an integrated structural biology approach to understand how nutrients obtained through the diet are transported across the blood-brain barrier.\n\nClaudia Kathe is also a finalist for the prize, for her essay, \u201cRewiring movements.\u201d Kathe received an undergraduate degree and PhD from King\u2019s College London. After completing her postdoctoral fellowship at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), she started her laboratory in the Department of Fundamental Neuroscience at the University of Lausanne in 2024. Her research investigates the reorganization of neuronal networks in the spinal cord in neurological disorders and its impact on sensorimotor function."

Learn More\n\nJust as enterprises continue to adopt large language model-powered text-to-SQL as a way to \u2018talk\u2019 to their data assets, a new shift in the ecosystem has started emerging: AI agents. Today, New York-based Redbird announced a new chat platform that uses \u201cspecialist agents\u201d to help enterprises handle most analytics value chain tasks, from data collection and engineering to data science and producing actual insights (reporting).\n\nThis means an enterprise user can give a natural language prompt to get insights from data in almost real-time and execute analytical efforts that pave the way for those insights. According to Erin Tavgac, the co-founder and CEO of the company, this represents more than 90% of an enterprise\u2019s business intelligence efforts.\n\n\u201cFor the past several decades the promise of truly self-serve analytics has fallen short for organizations, with the reality instead being complex data pipelines, dashboards, and shadow analytics that require technical skills. We have invested significant R&D into fusing the power of LLMs with Redbird\u2019s robust end-to-end analytical toolkit in the form of AI agents that enable users to finally achieve self-serve, conversational BI that runs on their organization\u2019s data,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nMoving into the age of AI agents\n\nWhile the age of AI agents is new, Redbird itself has been a long-standing player in the analytics domain. The company started in 2018 as Cube Analytics and provided enterprises with a no-code, drag-and-drop toolkit that enabled their users to create workflows aimed at automating and unifying all analytical tasks leading to dashboarding and insights. Earlier this year, the company expanded this work with the launch of a conversational interface, allowing users to ask business questions in natural language and receive insights and reporting outputs in real-time.\n\nNow, as the next step, Redbird has added an ecosystem of specialized agents that operate on top of this end-to-end toolkit to orchestrate as well as execute multi-step analytical tasks to answer business-related questions.\n\nAs Tavgac explained, admins setting up the chat platform have to choose a base LLM (like GPT, Llama etc) and load up their organization\u2019s proprietary data ontologies, business logic and reporting blueprints (like business definitions, PowerPoint report templates, etc.) to customize it with relevant business context. Once the data is inputted, the AI agents using the LLM begin to use all the context and generate metadata from the information to do their work \u2014 in response to user questions.\n\n\u201cUser prompts are sent to Redbird routing agents, which identify the best specialist agents to execute the tasks for that prompt (like PowerPoint Reporting agent, Data Engineering agent, etc.) and figure out how to orchestrate the execution order of those agents. Each specialist agent then manages its own part of the overall task by identifying relevant datasets/ontologies and executing the needed task using the Redbird toolkit, which includes applications and functions to handle the mechanical steps of the pipeline,\u201d Tavgac noted.\n\nDetailing the tasks, he noted Redbird agents can pull unstructured or structured data from over 100 data sources, including Snowflake, Databricks and Hubspot. It can run advanced processing on top of the collected data by performing data wrangling, AI-driven tagging and data science modeling. It can also generate robust reporting outputs (like presentations, Excel reports and email/Slack updates) while taking necessary actions based on those reports (like executing an ad buy/modifying a campaign).\n\n\u201cOnce the task is executed, the chat platform responds to the user with not just a text answer but also any deliverables needed, like a PowerPoint report the agents built or the data that they collected from a SaaS system,\u201d he said.\n\nRedbird Platform Screenshot \u2013 AI Chat (Marketing Analytics)\n\nNo-code workflow orchestration remains available\n\nAs enterprises double down on their data efforts, going beyond text-to-SQL \u2014 adopted by Dremio, Snowflake and many others \u2013 and streamlining the analytics pipeline end-to-end with AI agents could be a great way to save time and resources.\n\nHowever, as many may still have concerns over the reliability of AI agents, Redbird is not doing away with its original drag-and-drop interface for automating business intelligence workflows. Instead, the company has made no-code the secondary option for users. The agents will orchestrate the tasks while also creating a no-code version of the workflow, allowing users to audit and inspect everything in detail if required.\n\n\u201cSo far, existing AI solutions have primarily tackled the automation of a very small fraction of BI and analytics efforts (SQL querying). While Redbird values and solves for that use case (text-to-SQL), it is also applying the power of its AI agents to automate the other more difficult and more sizable parts of enterprise BI workflows\u2026 Our approach to solving this challenge has enabled us to onboard eight of the Fortune 50 brands and over 30 mid-to-large-sized enterprise customers in the last few months,\u201d Tavgac added. This includes brands like Mondelez International, USA Today, Bobcat Company and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nCurrently, he said the company is offering its technology on a SaaS model with usage-based licensing fees and generating seven-figure revenue. However, he did not share the exact specifics.\n\nAs the next step, Redbird will continue its AI agent-driven work and take its new Chat platform to more enterprises. It also plans to add more advanced agents in the analytics value chain to enable even deeper AI-powered business intelligence coverage for non-technical users.\n\n\u201cWe also aim to expand beyond our primary focus on analytics / BI use cases and into a deeper \u2018Large Action Model\u2019 approach that leverages AI agents that can take more nuanced action based on the analytical results (i.e. purchase supplies, send invoices)."

        "article_content": "Komodo Health continues to invest in generative AI capabilities, seeing the potential to use AI-powered conversational language to make it easier for health research teams to parse through troves of data.\n\nThe health data company rolled out a new AI analytics assistant, MapAI, as part of its overarching platform MapLab.\n\nMapAI and another new tool, MapExplorer, enable healthcare professionals to explore any therapeutic area simply by asking questions in plain language, according to Laurent Bride, Komodo Health's chief technology officer.\n\nMapAI uses natural-language-processing-based generative AI to initiate an analysis of Komodo\u2019s Healthcare Map, made up of de-identified data on more than 330 million patient interactions within the healthcare system. The no-code ChatGPT-like tool enables health research teams, even individuals with no coding experience, to rapidly evaluate drug trends, track how diseases spread and evaluate how patients are being treated, according to the company.\n\nThe offering supports faster decision-making by enabling users at any skill level or experience with healthcare data to use conversational language to get clear answers to complex analytic questions in minutes versus hours or days, Komodo Health executives said.\n\nRelated Komodo Health locks in new specialty data partners to drive health economics and outcomes research\n\nKomodos\u2019s MapAI application allows users to ask healthcare-related questions using conversational language\u2014reducing the need to pull in data experts for early-stage analyses. Research teams can ask questions like, \"What is the patient breakdown of GLP-1 prescriptions by payer?\" or \"How many patients with a history of dementia were diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2023?\u201d\n\n\"For AI to truly deliver value in healthcare, a robust data foundation is essential\u2014and that\u2019s where Komodo\u2019s MapAI, our latest GenAI solution, powered by our Healthcare map shines,\" Bride said. \"Over the past decade, we've built a range of tools designed to meet users wherever they are, providing the right experiences\u2014whether they need no-code, low-code or high-code solutions. This approach has enabled a suite of analytics that empowers life sciences, payers, providers and developers to generate and scale critical insights efficiently.\"\n\nKomodo Health customers often express frustration over the time spent preparing data for analysis, Bride noted.\n\n\"They crave streamlined tools that not only simplify processes but also eliminate the need for multiple-point solutions. With these new capabilities, we\u2019re paving the way for healthcare companies to collaborate more effectively, navigate market complexities, mitigate risks, and make data-driven decisions that drive both immediate and long-term success. And this is just the beginning of the innovations we\u2019ll be rolling out this year,\" he said.\n\nInsights gleaned from MapAI can be easily transferred into MapView, Komodo\u2019s no-code application on the MapLab platform, featuring pre-built analytic modules for market and disease landscaping, patient and healthcare provider segmentation and brand performance monitoring.\n\nA 2024 survey from Frost & Sullivan found that healthcare companies spend an average of seven months gathering data into a usable state.\n\nNew generative-AI-powered tools propose to be accelerants for decision-making within healthcare and life sciences organizations. They give anyone within an enterprise\u2014regardless of their experience working with healthcare data\u2014the ability to produce the type of net-new insights needed for critical business decisions, Komodo Health executives said.\n\nMapAI significantly cuts down time to insights and allows users to more quickly test and iterate hypotheses before initiating deeper, costly analyses.\n\n\n\nIt marks the newest addition to the MapLab platform and is launching alongside another new, AI-enabled tool called MapExplorer. That solution is designed for companies that are new to the Healthcare Map but want to access its capabilities, equipping teams with point-and-click functionality and conversational AI features, according to the company.\n\nKomodo Health also recently announced it was integrating Cornerstone AI's software into components of its MapEnhance offering. MapEnhance, first unveiled in 2023, features a library of specialty data sets from Komodo and its partners.\n\nThe move to integrate with Cornerstone AI follows a successful pilot program in which Cornerstone's proprietary algorithms strengthened the fidelity of Komodo's Lab Results, a product available within MapEnhance, the companies said.\n\nKomodo claims its suite of products, including MapLab, is currently being used by over 200 life sciences and healthcare organizations, including Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novo Nordisk, MoonLake Immunotherapeutics, Regeneron and Takeda Pharmaceuticals.\n\nLaunched in 2014 by co-founders Web Sun and Arif Nathoo, M.D., the company has raised $514 million to date, including a $220 million series E round in 2021 and a structured equity infusion of $200 million in November 2022."

        "article_content": "Progress Software (PRGS) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Progress Software basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Progress Software imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Progress Software\n\nThis business software maker is expected to earn $4.78 per share for the fiscal year ending November 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 9.9%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Progress Software. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.7%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Progress Software to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
