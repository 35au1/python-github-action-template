            "article_content": "Chasen Cos., a Baltimore development firm that gained steam during the pandemic housing boom, faces new legal trouble after a bank alleged it defaulted on a nearly $14 million loan.\n\nCourt records filed this month show that a company subsidiary, which owns one property on the 500 block of South Broadway and two others behind it on the 500 block of South Regester Street, failed to make payments on a $13.7 million loan from PeoplesBank, a Pennsylvania-based lender that has since merged with Orrstown Bank.\n\nIt\u2019s the third time since September that Chasen Cos. has faced a foreclosure filing over its Baltimore properties, and at least a dozen contractors and vendors also have alleged nonpayment in lawsuits.\n\nRepresentatives for Chasen Cos. did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nTrustees for the bank wrote in legal filings that in addition to stopping payments last year, Chasen Cos. also violated the agreement by halting work on the project. The trustees also referenced the company\u2019s challenges elsewhere, citing \u201cmaterial adverse changes in their financial conditions\u201d as evidenced by the Maryland-based Sandy Spring Bank obtaining judgments against the company.\n\nOrrstown Bank gave Chasen Cos. and its founders, Brandon Chasen and Paul Davis, a deadline of Dec. 13 to begin satisfying their obligations, according to court documents. But Chasen Cos. offered no such relief, the bank trustees allege. To date, the real estate firm owes more than $4.6 million on the loan and is accruing as much as $1,317 a day in interest, the documents say.\n\nThe company owns as many as 2,000 housing units across its portfolio in Baltimore, Virginia and Florida and agreed to strict loan terms that allow the bank to automatically enter judgment in the event of a default. That\u2019s what also led to judgments on the One Calvert Plaza skyscraper in Downtown Baltimore and 1400 Aliceanna St., and banks have moved to foreclose on the buildings.\n\nChasen Cos. said it would build luxury apartments on the empty lots now facing foreclosure. (Julie Bykowicz)\n\nChasen Cos., which has offices in Fells Point and was as recently as a year ago poised to become a dominant landlord in that neighborhood, has stopped working on many of its projects.\n\nThe Baltimore Business Journal reported in late 2022 that Chasen Cos. planned to flip the vacant lots on South Broadway and South Regester into a mixed-use retail and luxury housing building called The Brooks. Online property records show the company purchased the lots for about $1.75 million and advertised them as a five-story, ground-up project that would feature 49 luxury apartments.\n\nThe Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nToday, the empty lots near the Broadway Market are cordoned off by metal fences. Inside, piles of bricks, rubble and concrete chunks are all that are visible.\n\nBaltimore Banner reporter Greg Morton contributed to this story."

It\u2019s a story about the stock market, whether there\u2019s an AI bubble, and how important Nvidia has become to so many people\u2019s financial future. It\u2019s also a story about China, export controls, and American AI dominance. And then, somewhere in there, there\u2019s a story about technology: about how a startup managed to build cheaper, more efficient AI models with few of the capital and technological advantages its competitors have.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, we talk about all these angles and a few more, because DeepSeek is the story of the moment on so many levels. Nilay and David discuss whether companies like OpenAI and Anthropic should be nervous, why reasoning models are such a big deal, and whether all this extra training and advancement actually adds up to much of anything at all. (Nilay has a long comparison to Bluetooth, in case that helps you guess where we land.)\n\nAfter that, we go through our email inbox (vergecast@theverge.com) and the Vergecast Hotline (866-VERGE11), and talk about some of your responses to last week\u2019s question about how people use AI. Thank you so much to everyone who wrote in and called! There are so many interesting, complex, thoroughly human ways we\u2019re all interacting with ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and the rest (but frankly, mostly ChatGPT), and we learned a lot from your examples.

            "article_content": "\u2018Presence\u2019 Review \u2013 Paranormal Purgatory\n\nA still from Presence by Steven Soderbergh, an official selection of the Premieres Program at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. Courtesy of Sundance Institute.\n\nWritten by David Koepp (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, The Mummy 2017) and directed by Steven Soderbergh (Logan Lucky, Side Effects), Presence has an intriguing concept that doesn\u2019t completely work in its execution. Shot in three weeks almost entirely in one location with a $2 million budget, Presence is a creative powerhouse that lacks a lasting impression.\n\nAll of Presence is from the perspective of an entity in a suburban house. The supernatural thriller seemingly has no close-ups while the cinematography is different in a way that seems like it was shot with a slight fish-eye lens. A family, The Paynes \u2013 Rebekah (Lucy Liu), Chris (Chris Sullivan), Chloe (Callina Liang), and Tyler (Eddy Maday), moves into the empty house revealed at the beginning of the film.\n\n(L to R) Chloe (Callina Liang), Chris (Chris Sullivan), Tyler (Eddy Maday), Rebekah (Lucy Liu), and Cece (Julia Fox) in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nThe SNAFU\u2019d relationship between The Paynes is palpable as soon as they\u2019re introduced. Rebekah is committing financial fraud and her husband Chris is contemplating separation or divorce. Rebekah also prioritizes her older son Tyler and his athleticism in swimming over her younger daughter Chloe, who barely ranks acknowledgement. Meanwhile, Chris is concerned for Chloe since her best friend abruptly died and she still hasn\u2019t gotten over it.\n\nThe idea of a horror or supernatural film from the perspective of the ghost or entity is insanely cool, but the issue here is that this presence isn\u2019t given much to do besides witness people have sex and argue.\n\nCallina Liang as Chloe in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nThere are expected supernatural elements here like doors mysteriously opening or closing on their own, a stack of books floating in the air one by one and being stacked neatly on a nearby desk, and shelves and posters being ripped off the wall.\n\nBefore The Paynes arrive, the first scene of the film is supposed to be this entity wandering around an empty house. It\u2019s fascinating at first but becomes dizzying and nauseating, which may represent the claustrophobic aspect of being trapped somewhere with no escape but still not entirely fun to watch.\n\nPresence features the first truly nasty on-screen character of the year in Ryan (West Mulholland). Ryan is a popular classmate of Tyler and a drug dealer. He gets romantically involved with Chloe and tries to appear nonchalant and supportive.\n\nCracks bubble up to the surface early on as he loses his temper often and his rambling typically sounds like a villain attempting to explain their evil plan in detail to a subdued victim.\n\nThe film\u2019s editing is bizarre since most sequences either feel like one-take or suddenly shift to black before the next scene. Presence is presented like a bunch of scenes randomly stitched together that just happen to make a semi-coherent story.\n\n(L to R) Chris (Chris Sullivan) and Rebekah (Lucy Liu) in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nThe acting in Presence is fine, but two of the four Payne family members are complete jerks while the other two are pushovers. This dynamic makes it difficult to get invested in any of their character developments.\n\nThe existence of the entity in the film is deeply connected to grief and trauma, which allows people who have almost died or experienced something truly traumatic to see or feel someone who has died.\n\nCallina Liang as Chloe in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nA medium is brought into The Payne\u2019s home after everyone but Chris stops making fun of Chloe\u2019s encounters with the entity. The medium does little for the film apart from solidifying that Chloe isn\u2019t making it up and drawing attention to an item in their living room that will be a part of the last scene in the film.\n\nThere is a unique concept in Presence that hasn\u2019t entirely been explored in the genre, especially when combined with captivatingly different cinematography and a talented cast. But there aren\u2019t enough actual horror elements in Presence to be scary, and the family drama is mostly uninteresting apart from this entity being a part of their lives.\n\nLucy Liu as Rebekah in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nPresence is a close-but-no-cigar thriller with unusual camera tricks and everyone staring off slightly to the left or right to drive its sense of mystery.\n\nPresence (2025), Neon 2 OVERALL SCORE PROS Refreshing concept\n\nDecent acting CONS The tedius nature of drama over horror\n\nCinematography becomes tiresome"

I just think the world is more interesting with magic and love is its own special kind of magic.\"\n\nAn author of 15 books with such titles as \"A Shadow Among the Stars\" and \"Soul Sacrifice,\" Davis will release her newest tale Tuesday via 5 Prince Publishing and Books LLC: \"Demons and Tea Leaves.\"\n\n\"I came up with the idea of a woman accidentally summoning a demon. From there I expanded the idea,\" Davis explained. \"What would the circumstances be that she'd accidentally perform a spell, and what then would the demon do?\"\n\nThis particular story is for readers of sweet romances and fans of the paranormal, Davis said.\n\n\"If you enjoy the movie 'Practical Magic' and the show 'Charmed,' I think you'll enjoy 'Demons and Tea Leaves,'\" she said.\n\nAn educator for 10 years, Davis is a longtime North Idahoan. She grew up in Bonners Ferry, where she graduated from high school, then went to North Idaho College for an associate degree and attended the University of Idaho, where she earned a master's degree in elementary education.\n\n\"I love so many things about living here, aside from the cold dark winters,\" she said.\n\nDavis has been writing since she was a teenager. The first story she published was started when she was 18. She said she always knew she wanted to write.\n\n\"I was a voracious reader growing up and felt like I could do just as good as many of the books I enjoyed, so I gave it a shot,\" she said. \"I published quite a few eBooks in my 20s then took a break from writing for a bit as I had my two boys and came back to it in 2020.\"\n\nShe said her favorite thing about writing is exploring a story that comes into her head as a tiny idea and expanding that idea into a full story for others to enjoy.\n\n\"Any time someone reads one of my books, I hope that it gives them a momentary escape from reality and a trip through a fantastically entertaining story,\" Davis said.\n\nDavis will be signing books at It's a Love Story bookstore, 8927 N. Hess St. Suite A, Hayden, at 4:30 p.m. Feb. 21. Her works can be found locally at the Well-Read Moose, It's a Love Story, Kindred Bookstore and the Coeur d'Alene Public Library, as well as on amazon.com.\n\nInfo: authorcourtneydavis.com"

            "article_content": "Scientists recently reported an unexpected deep-sea development in the Pacific: certain metallic rocks seem to be making oxygen in the dark, without light or sunshine, at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThis idea runs counter to the usual belief that oxygen only forms in sunlight through photosynthesis.\n\nAlthough these findings have stirred debate, the central claim is that potato-sized nodules found thousands of feet below the surface appear to split seawater molecules and release oxygen.\n\nOxygen and photosynthesis \u2013 the basics\n\nSince the late 1700s, we\u2019ve been taught that light creates oxygen through photosynthesis, a crucial natural process that keeps life on Earth thriving.\n\nPlants, algae, and some bacteria soak up sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, nature uses light as fuel to produce the oxygen we breathe and keep everything on Earth alive.\n\nPhotosynthesis not only gives energy to these organisms but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, maintaining the perfect balance of gases that most life forms need.\n\nUntil the discovery of dark oxygen, it has been commonly accepted knowledge that without light, photosynthesis would grind to a halt, and our planet wouldn\u2019t have the oxygen-rich air we rely on every day.\n\nDeep-sea rocks making oxygen\n\nExploration in a region called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone \u2013 where deep-sea mining companies are eyeing metals resources like cobalt and nickel \u2013 uncovered ferromanganese nodules resting on the ocean floor.\n\nFerromanganese nodules are like little treasure rocks that settle on the ocean floor, packed with metals such as manganese and iron.\n\nThese nodules form slowly over millions of years as minerals from seawater build up in layers around a tiny core, like a shark tooth or a piece of shell.\n\nThink of them as underwater onions, with each layer adding more minerals and creating these cool, rounded shapes.\n\nResearchers suggested that the nodules may produce electric charges that spark electrolysis, generating oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nHow do the rocks produce oxygen?\n\nEarly studies raised plenty of questions about the process and the potential effect on seafloor life.\n\nLeading the push for more answers is Andrew Sweetman, a professor at the Scottish Association for Marine Science.\n\nHe is running a three-year project to investigate how these nodules might form oxygen in the absence of light. One of his goals is to see if this phenomenon appears in other parts of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.\n\n\u201cOur discovery of dark oxygen was a paradigm shift in our understanding of the deep sea and potentially life on Earth, but it threw up more questions than answers,\u201d said Sweetman.\n\nHe and his team will also look into whether microbial reactions help release hydrogen, an energy source for certain deep-sea microbes.\n\nFreshwater mysteries\n\nDark oxygen has popped up in other surprising, light-deprived places.\n\nEmil Ruff detected oxygen in freshwater samples beneath Alberta, Canada. It appeared in groundwater that had been isolated for tens of thousands of years, yet still contained enough oxygen to support life.\n\n\u201cAfter 40,000 years or 30,000 years (separated from surface processes), there\u2019s no reason really to think that there should be any oxygen left,\u201d remarked Ruff.\n\nHe found that special bacteria could produce oxygen on their own by breaking down certain dissolved compounds.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ruff found that the quantity of oxygen produced was enough to sustain other oxygen-dependent microbial life in the groundwater.\n\nChallenging dark oxygen\n\nNot all scientists are in agreement about this dark oxygen discovery. Some deep-sea mining interests challenged Sweetman\u2019s work, saying they have found no such electrical oddities in the nodules.\n\nThe Metals Co. submitted a rebuttal of the scientific research paper to Nature Geoscience, which awaits peer review.\n\nMeanwhile, independent observers note the need for more experiments. A research oceanographer at the US Geological Survey\u2019s Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California, said the USGS has not observed any electrical phenomena in ferromanganese nodules examined so far.\n\nShe was not involved in either Sweetman\u2019s or Ruff\u2019s research.\n\nNASA hopes these findings might hint at life in places beyond Earth. Dark ocean worlds like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus are prime targets for research.\n\nSweetman shared that the space agency wants to test whether high pressures found on those icy moons can trigger oxygen generation in deep-sea rocks without direct sunlight. If the same basic chemistry works there, it could point to possible microbial life in alien seas.\n\nDark oxygen and deep-sea mining\n\nThe Clarion-Clipperton Zone sits far offshore, and mining there is governed by the International Seabed Authority. Critics argue that removing nodules in huge volumes could destroy habitats.\n\nOrganizations like Fauna & Flora warn of irreparable harm, saying it may disturb carbon storage in the ocean. Sweetman believes it is risky to harvest seabed minerals until scientists know a lot more about these systems.\n\nHe acknowledges the controversy and plans to address critics in peer-reviewed forums. For now, the hunt for hard data continues, fueled by the hope of expanding our understanding of life \u2013 both here and possibly on other worlds.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Geoscience.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "With the new year underway, it\u2019s time to celebrate a remarkable 2024 full of citizen science with the Unistellar Network! Thousands of professional and amateur astronomers came together once again to observe, document, and contribute valuable data to the scientific community. From catching supernovae in the act to tracking exoplanet transits and unraveling asteroid mysteries, our network has been busier than ever. In fact, Unistellar observers broke a record this past year by making over 10,000 citizen science observations in 2024 alone. Let\u2019s take a journey through more of the year\u2019s highlights!\n\nComets: A Year of Bright Surprises and Fading Legends\n\n2024 was a spectacular year for comet observations, with 1,563 observations made by 246 observers around the world. Unistellar members continued to track the decline of Comet 103P/Hartley 2, documented multiple outbursts of 12P/Pons-Brooks, and, most excitingly, observed C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS)\u2014the brightest comet of the decade!\n\nComet 12P/Pons-Brooks during outburst, when it looked akin to the Millennium Falcon! Image by Aad Verveen.\n\nComet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) imaged by Unistellar Citizen Astronomer Karen Fischer.\n\nCosmic Cataclysms: An Explosive Universe\n\nOur network played a pivotal role in capturing some of the most energetic events in the cosmos. Two hundred Citizen Astronomers recorded 5,656 observations across 90 different targets, including 47 supernova candidates, 24 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and 11 variable stars. This data amounted to a staggering 1.3 million images of transient events taken in 2024.\n\nThe Unistellar Network light curve of T CrB since July 2023.\n\nExoplanets: Unlocking the Secrets of Distant Worlds\n\nExoplanet hunters in the Unistellar Network had a busy year, observing over 130 unique exoplanets. With 133 telescopes over 6 continents, the network captured exoplanets transiting in front of their stars and even contributed to confirming two new exoplanets\u2014TIC 393818343 b and TIC 24129530 b! All of the participating Citizen Astronomers are listed as co-authors on these scientific papers, cementing their contributions to science.\n\nAsteroid Occultations: Timing the Shadows of Space Rocks\n\nIn 2024, Unistellar members recorded 408 occultation events, with 54 confirmed positive detections (meaning the asteroid\u2019s shadow was successfully captured). Some of the year\u2019s highlights include the longest recorded occultation event in Unistellar history when the asteroid 120 Lachesis blocked a star\u2019s light for nearly 38 seconds!\n\nThe occultation of a distant star by asteroid 120 Lachesis, captured by Steven Adkinson.\n\nPlanetary Defense & Satellite Tracking: Keeping an Eye on the Sky\n\nWhile planetary defense observations help track the orbits of near-Earth asteroids, man-made satellites are important to track as well. The Defense & Satellite division kept a close watch on these objects near or in Earth\u2019s orbit, making 1,263 planetary defense observations and 797 satellite observations.\n\nShape models of the asteroid 198 Ampella from different angles. Unistellar citizen science data contributed to determining the final shape.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for 2025?\n\nWith another year of discoveries behind us, the Unistellar Network is gearing up for an even more exciting 2025. What new exoplanets will we help confirm? Will another bright comet steal the show? How many more asteroid shadows will we capture? One thing\u2019s for sure\u2014our citizen astronomers will be there, eyes (and telescopes) turned skyward, ready to unlock the next cosmic mystery.\n\nHere\u2019s to another incredible year of scientific collaboration, curiosity, and exploration. See you in 2025!"

            "article_content": "As AI abounds and consolidation comes calling, the marcomms agency landscape is poised for a significant shakeup in 2025.\n\nBut where some see challenge, others seize opportunity. And so, to coincide with our Predictions event on thedrum.com, throughout this week our journalists have been making some predictions of their own by spotlighting the agencies they believe will dominate the headlines this year.\n\nThey have done so armed with some important information, as all the agencies featured across this series have earned The Drum Recommends status on the strength of their recent performance and quality of work.\n\nAMV BBDO, Hearts & Science and Code and Theory were among those recognized in part one. It was the turn of FCB, Mower and Whalar in part two. Then Area 23, David Madrid, Zulu Alpha Kilo enjoyed their moment in part three. And, in part four, Ogilvy UK, Monks and DDB Colombia all featured. Today, we have more heavy hitters to recognize from across the globe.\n\nSo scroll on to hear from our latest Agencies to Watch honorees about how they\u2019re preparing themselves for the major trends upon us in 2025.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nThe Accenture Song-owned ad agency featured prominently at The Drum Awards for Advertising, winning Golds in the Finance, Sports and Sound Design categories, while its S\u00e3o Paulo office partnered with Dove to celebrate 20 years of its \u2018Campaign for Real Beauty.\u2019\n\nWhat key trends do you foresee defining the industry in 2025?\n\nMark Green, global chief executive officer: Fighting evil in the algorithm. As content becomes increasingly polarized, brands will have to fight the urge to settle in the middle and play it safe. Growth for brands will be in unifying, not dividing.\n\nThe creative differentiator. Creativity will increasingly be the differentiation in business as new ideas are copied and replicated as quickly as DeepSeek, for example. Therefore, the power of brand becomes more crucial.\n\nHigher-order creativity. While robots and AI will transform jobs, industries and indeed advertising, human empathy and higher-order creativity will be the saviors. They were, are and will be the answer to growth.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nGreen: A truly global Droga5 \u2013 fueled by borderless creativity and a renewed creative ambition \u2013 will be an even more powerful weapon as we continue pushing our creative boundaries further and beyond advertising. We firmly believe our best work is ahead of us. We have an exciting group of leaders that have the ambition to take creativity much further than advertising and we have a unique relationship with Accenture that brings the best of creativity, technology and consulting together. We have also learned a lot from successes and failures in equal measure and will now put this to work in the best way possible. New offices, new leaders and exciting new work will be the result.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nGreen: Dove\u2019s \u2018The Code\u2019: To celebrate 20 years of its pioneering \u2018Campaign for Real Beauty,\u2019 Dove partnered with Droga5 S\u00e3o Paulo to reinforce its commitment to real beauty. Vowing never to use AI to create or distort women\u2019s images, \u2018The Code\u2019 demonstrated how adding the phrase \u2018According to Dove Real Beauty campaign\u2019 to AI-generated prompts resulted in dramatically more diverse, inclusive, and authentic images. This sets a new standard for brands navigating evolving technology.\n\nSolament\u2019s \u2018The Down-Less Down Jacket\u2019: In Japan, Droga5 Tokyo applied a new technology and called it Solament, a unique material that absorbs near-infrared sunlight to generate heat and protect people from the cold. We then created the brand and developed a prototype for a transparent puffer jacket. This is a product and innovation going beyond advertising.\n\nSydney Opera House\u2019s \u2018Play It Safe\u2019: Celebrating 50 years, Droga5 Australia created a musical tribute to one of the world\u2019s most celebrated cultural landmarks, the Sydney Opera House. The musical created in collaboration with Tim Minchin reminded us of the power of creativity and its endless possibilities when you don\u2019t \u2018Play It Safe.\u2019 This is the power of entertainment for brands.\n\nBosch\u2019s \u2018#LikeABosch\u2019: Last summer, Bosch named Droga5 its US Agency of Record, tasked with ambitiously expanding Bosch\u2019s presence in the US market. Those ambitious plans with Droga5 include leading the German engineering and tech company to make its Super Bowl debut with an extension of Bosch\u2019s 2024 #LikeABosch platform.\n\nNRMA\u2019s \u2018A Help Company\u2019: Celebrating 100 years NRMA wanted to transform from an insurance company that helps people to a help company that does insurance. We created a new brand platform to deliver this message while also taking creativity further across digital channels, product design and service delivery. This is more than a marketing transformation but rather a wholesale customer transformation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe media agency had another award-laden year, the best yet in its 34-year history, picking up gongs at shows including The Drum Awards for Media and The Drum Awards for Marketing, including Gold in the Travel and Tourism category for its \u2018If You\u2019re Into It\u2019 campaign for The V&A.\n\nWhat key trends do you foresee defining the industry in 2025?\n\nPaul Knight, incoming CEO, PHD UK: In a market that is experiencing media fragmentation, asset fragmentation and capability fragmentation, marketers need 2025 to be the year where consumer experiences are better connected.\n\nThe agencies that will thrive in 2025 will be the ones that can best connect their talent, technology, and data to accelerate and elevate new solutions for clients and deliver better brand experiences for consumers.\n\nKey to this will be agencies\u2019 abilities to harness AI to improve efficiency in areas such as data distillation, audience pattern recognition and lateral thinking. We will also start to see the emergence of agentic AI, which acts autonomously on a user\u2019s behalf, completing complex tasks without prompting.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one thing that will continue to define the industry but isn\u2019t a new trend. When we get to the end of 2025, we will yet again be celebrating ingenious, creative thinking that creates real competitive advantage for clients. And long may that continue.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nSarah Nugent, managing director, PHD London: Following a year where we successfully retained \u00a3250m+ in incumbent pitches and added almost \u00a3150m of net new wins to our client list, we\u2019ve entered 2025 with significant business momentum and with Knighty\u2019s imminent arrival as CEO in February we are full of energy to bring PHD\u2019s new \u2018Intelligence. Connected\u2019 positioning to life in the work we do.\n\nWe exist to help clients Outthink, Outpace and Outgrow the competition so we will be continuing to prioritize the power of thinking to develop and grow new products and services that are designed to offer clients new solutions to new challenges, building on our recent successes in areas such as data consultancy and gaming.\n\nWe\u2019re already underway with this, having already launched a new UK cultural insight platform called Culture Currents, which unveiled new research into the importance of brands embracing optimism in a challenging macro-economic and political climate. There will be much more of that to come this year and as an agency, we\u2019re also massively optimistic about what 2025 will bring.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nEuan Hudghton, chief brand and experience officer, PHD UK: 2024 was a standout year for work at PHD UK, becoming the most awarded year in the agency\u2019s 34-year history, including winning five Grand Prix awards.\n\nAs importantly, our winning campaigns also reflected the breadth of work a modern media agency now needs to deliver for its clients. Work that was effective, creative, and inclusive.\n\nPHD clients won six IPA Effectiveness awards, including the Grand Prix for McCain.\n\nOur \u2018Streams of (un)consciousness\u2019 campaign for the British Heart Foundation flatlined the Twitch streams of 14 prominent gaming influencers to promote CPR training, directly leading to a life being saved.\n\nAward-winning campaigns for Andrex ranged from driving sales in new retail media spaces to partnering with ITV to redesign the Big Brother diary room chair made from toilet rolls.\n\nWe were also delighted to do our bit to make media more inclusive, brokering audio description and British Sign Language partnerships with ITV and Channel 4 for Guinness and Virgin Atlantic.\n\nAnd there\u2019ll be more of that kind of work to come in 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNils Leonard\u2019s hot shop continued to impress in 2024, its British Airways \u2018Windows\u2019 work picking up gongs at Cannes Lions and The Drum Awards for Advertising.\n\nUncommon\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nAI won\u2019t define 2025 \u2013 our reaction to it will. As AI mass-produces mediocrity, rare ideas, taste and beauty become more valuable. The industry\u2019s fear is misplaced; automation pushes creativity further.\n\nPolarization will shift from risk to strategy. Brands must take bold stands, leaving some behind while fostering loyal communities. Forget playing it safe \u2013 conviction and agitation will drive sharper, more meaningful work.\n\n2025 will be a landmark year for design. No longer just a backdrop, design itself will spark conversations, provoke reactions and shape brand narratives. Smart brands will harness its power for fame, engagement and cultural relevance.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWe\u2019re taking our design practice to the next level with more projects \u2013 off the back of the biggest rebrand in entertainment history for EA Sports FC and our disruptive graphic design system for Vimeo. As well as exploring new avenues including retail design \u2013 as we\u2019re set to redesign The Ordinary\u2019s store experience globally.\n\nArchitecture continues to be another area of growth in our founding partnership with Thomas Heatherwick\u2019s \u2018Humanise\u2019 movement. Last year, we launched UnLandmarks, a campaign using AI to reimagine iconic British buildings through the lens of monotonous architectural trends. The project is set to expand to the US in 2025.\n\nUnrest is an accelerator developing impact-led consumer brands. Based in our London studio since its inception, we can\u2019t wait to continue to cultivate this year\u2019s cohort as the program\u2019s continued brand partner.\n\nThis year also sees the launch of our third film feature, The Thing with Feathers, which premiered at Sundance 2025 with rave reviews, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and directed by Dylan Southern.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe redefined Christmas with JD Sports\u2019 #1 YouTube ad; launched Monzo\u2019s first brand campaign and ATMmm stunt, making it Marketing Society\u2019s Brand of the Year; crafted British Airways\u2019 Cannes-winning \u2018Windows\u2019 and viral safety video; made reference point B2B work with Hiscox helping the insurer reach record profits; designed the first-ever brand identity with resolution at its core for Vimeo; challenged beauty industry standards with provocative outdoor for The Ordinary speaking to the brand\u2019s philosophy of science over celebrity and celebrated Erling Haaland\u2019s quirks, challenging the serious nature of sports marketing with Beats \u2013 all combining creativity and effectiveness to pick up four Effies and continue to build brands the world wished existed.\n\nAn award-winning 2024 for the global media agency saw it pick up 10 trophies at The Drum Awards for Media, including the Chair\u2019s Award for its work with Transport for London.\n\nWavemaker\n\nWhat key trends do you foresee defining the industry in 2025?\n\nHow long is a piece of string? In such a fast-paced, constantly changing industry like ours, there\u2019s always something influencing or impacting it in any given year.\n\nRather than trends, I like to focus on what\u2019s keeping our clients awake at night or the things they are trying to navigate to deliver sustainable business growth \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s going to define the industry and what we need to do to adapt. I believe this year, there\u2019ll be three things frequenting our agenda.\n\nThe first is HFSS \u2013 in October this year we\u2019ll see the HFSS advertising legislation come into place. This isn\u2019t just going to impact HFSS brands; it\u2019s going to impact everyone \u2013 we\u2019ll see increased competition for premium inventory and in turn, an impact cost that\u2019s going to take some careful navigation to minimize the impact on ROI. The second is the \u2018messy middle\u2019; it\u2019s a topic that\u2019s never really gone away and one that clients and agencies have been navigating together, but I believe this year we\u2019ll see a renewed focus on working hard to maximize the power of the messy middle. And last but certainly not least is the intelligent use of AI (yes, it\u2019s being mentioned again!) in transforming creativity and problem-solving. It\u2019s definitely transforming how we operate as an agency, freeing up more space to focus on the client challenges that really need that human brain power.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting time to be part of WPP and GroupM. With lots of new leadership in place and a whole new way of operating, our platform advances, product innovation and collaborative spirit are serving us well, making us all stronger. The power of the group and the broader network is really enabling all of us at Wavemaker to live and breathe positive provocation, so I think you\u2019ll see a renewed energy from us this year in really provoking the industry and demonstrating what sets us apart as an agency. It\u2019s that positively provocative spirit that really gives us the focus on creating unrivaled work; I\u2019m confident that you\u2019re going to be seeing it in spades from Wavemaker UK in 2025.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nOh, blimey, this is a bit like having to pick a favorite child! I\u2019m incredibly proud of all our client work in 2024 - we really did see a step change in the volume of unrivaled work we were creating, powered by some great agency-wide initiatives that galvanized everyone behind the work. Some of the standout campaigns include \u2018Bonjour, Hello, Ciao, Ola, Konichiwa!\u2019 for TfL, where we combined real-time train and flight data into a globally recognized DOOH campaign for the Elizabeth Line; our groundbreaking activation for Paramount that transformed Piccadilly Lights into an ancient stone mosaic for Gladiator II; and our UnXpected FM campaign for the UK Government which tackled road safety in an authentic and impactful way.\n\nI\u2019m also really proud of our partnership with Morrisons, which shines a light on what makes Morrisons unique, as well as our work in the data space with Merlin and William Hill that leveraged our proprietary technology \u2018Geograph\u2019 to deliver business impact for both businesses.\n\nIt\u2019s always great to look back, but I\u2019m super excited for what\u2019s in store for 2025 when it comes to the work\u2026 watch this space!\n\nThe B2B specialist won in the Media and Technology-Led Innovation categories at The Drum Awards for B2B 2024, with its work for Juniper Networks and Ecologi.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nCreativity as a strategic brand/business asset: Creativity in B2B has made giant strides in recent years. The momentum for higher-order creativity \u2013 creativity that serves as a strategic asset to move a business forward into the future \u2013 is now unstoppable.\n\nThe essential role of buying groups. Every B2B purchase of consequence involves a buying group. Functional \u201cpoint\u201d buyers. Anonymous buyers, Hidden buyers. Building brand availability and preference at \u2018day one\u2019 of the purchase process is the only way to create and cultivate demand. The understanding that buying groups are not monoliths \u2013 with advocates, antagonists and neutrals all present within the same buying group \u2013 will influence brand strategy and activation going forward.\n\nThe 95/5 rule will become more nuanced. Within the 95% of buyers who are not in-market at any given time, there is a cohort of 25%-30% that is edging closer to market. B2B marketers will develop specific strategies to engage these \u2018in-betweens\u2019 and follow them as they progress into and through the funnel.\n\nBDX as B2B\u2019s default go-to-market model: Truly unified brand-to-demand marketing will become the rule rather than the exception. Brands will gain maturity by applying the Brand-to-Demand Experience (BDX) model. From organizational structures to omnichannel creative platforms to orchestration platforms, BDX will move to underpin effective B2B marketing.\n\nThe re-definition of the role of brand in B2B. In-market, out-of-market and in between. Top, middle and bottom of funnel. Brand\u2019s multiplier effect on performance marketing. The magnitude and expansiveness of brand\u2019s role in driving demand and growth is becoming a mainstream B2B belief. Brand investment will grow in turn because it must.\n\nAI will move from hype to focused, strategic reality. While experimentation will continue for years, as will the AI arms race, marketers and agencies will focus on a core set of use cases that go beyond tactical enhancements to play a strategic role in all areas of value delivery.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWith new global CEO Kate MacNevin now at the helm, Stein IAS is continuing its growth journey and increasing its growth trajectory. Stein\u2019s positioning \u2013 Building the World\u2019s Most Demanded B2B Brands \u2013 connects the agency to the most consequential brands globally. Our Brand-to-Demand Experience (BDX) framework released at Cannes addresses the most critical challenge faced by B2B marketers \u2013 building brand strength in order drive demand strength and sustainable growth. As we scale BDX, we anticipate senior hires across the agency, particularly in creative, strategy and business leadership.\n\nIn 2025 and beyond, Stein IAS will continue to lead the industry BDX agenda by: launching the first B2B brand-to-demand maturity study, including industry perspectives on media allocation; partnering with LinkedIn, IAA, ANA and the ANA Lions CMO Growth Council to develop a Future of B2B Buying model; partnering with Brand Finance on the 2025 Most Valuable B2B Brands Index, focusing on the imperative for B2B enterprises to invest in brand to accelerate growth and build enterprise value; partnering strategically with ecosystem leaders, including LinkedIn and 6sense, to unify brand and demand and up-level effectiveness and efficiency for the world\u2019s B2B brands; and launching v2 of our proprietary Origin data platform that leverages AI and direct feeds from LinkedIn\u2019s APIs to develop more relevant and actionable personas, audiences, messaging and content, richer segmentation, and more effective media planning and activation.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nThe Mack Trucks \u2018By America\u2019s Side\u2019 campaign reconnected the soul of the iconic Mack Trucks brand with truck/fleet owners and operators. While the audience\u2019s affinity with Mack is considerable going back many years, it had lessened over time and needed to be strengthened anew in a highly competitive market. To accomplish this, we brought Mack back \u2013 the famous bulldog mascot that adorns the hood of every Mack truck \u2013 and made him the centerpiece of the campaign focused on Mack\u2019s role in helping to build America for 125 years.\n\nWe worked with Juniper Networks to progress its brand-to-demand marketing, driving performance and efficiency. \u2018The Now Way To Network\u2019 campaign positioned Juniper\u2019s first-mover, AI-native enterprise networking solutions, driving brand salience and connecting top-of-funnel to pipeline through highly orchestrated customer journeys across lines of business. Along the way, Juniper and Stein won an ANA B2 Awards Gold for Multi-Year Impact and our first-ever ARF David Ogilvy Award.\n\nIn introducing the new Elimini carbon removals brand (launched by global biomass leader Drax), Stein IAS and MSQ partner agencies The Gate and MMT needed to build category awareness, brand awareness and brand credibility, all while driving immediate demand. Our \u2018Removing Carbon for Good\u2019 brand-to-demand campaign added urgency and immediacy to the carbon removal conversation, establishing Elimini as a market leader and initiating a pipeline of enterprise customers ready to act."

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nWeb Client Runtime Security (WCRS) refers to the security or behavior of the code executed in users' internet browsers during their web interactions.\n\nThe first part of this series discussed why WCRS as a security discipline warrants specific attention in addition to traditional web application security solutions. The second article covered the limitations of traditional security solutions in addressing WCRS risk and proposed implementation options in terms of newer security mechanisms or solutions. This third and final article includes seven suggested steps or activities that organizations may find useful in operationalizing their WCRS programs or capabilities. These steps should provide a potential roadmap for organizations to obtain meaningful outcomes from WCRS solution implementation efforts.\n\nStep 1: Discovery\n\nThe first step in implementing WCRS solutions is to conduct a thorough discovery phase including all web applications and their associated third-party scripts. This involves creating an inventory of web assets and mapping out all dependencies, including those introduced by third-party services. By understanding the full scope of the application environment, organizations can identify key web applications that need to be protected and prioritize security efforts accordingly. The discovery phase is critical as it sets the foundation for subsequent steps and ensures that no critical assets are overlooked and left unprotected. The main objective of this step is to identify all web applications and monitoring requirements.\n\nThis effort could leverage configuration management databases (CMDB) as a starting point. However, it may be the case that some CMDB systems may not always yield accurate and up-to-date information. Implementation teams may therefore need to perform domain name system (DNS) and IP-based discovery against internet and intranet networks as such actions can uncover additional undocumented applications that may require protection.\n\nBy understanding the full scope of the application environment, organizations can identify key web applications that need to be protected and prioritize security efforts accordingly.\n\nStep 2: Prioritization of Web Applications\n\nWhen the discovery phase is complete, organizations should prioritize web applications for WCRS monitoring based on their risk profile. Factors such as the sensitivity of data handled, the volume of user traffic, and the criticality of the application to business operations should be considered. High-risk applications should receive immediate attention, while lower-risk applications can be addressed in a phased manner. This prioritization ensures that resources are allocated effectively, initially focusing on the most critical areas to maximize security impact.\n\nStep 3: Justification and Minimization of Third-Party Scripts\n\nOrganizations should assess the necessity of each third-party script and remove or replace those that are non-essential or pose significant risk. In other words, organizations should prioritize minimizing their attack surface, as reducing the attack surface is a key aspect of WCRS. This involves evaluating the functionality provided by third-party scripts against their security implications and seeking alternative solutions where possible. By minimizing the use of third-party scripts, organizations can reduce the likelihood of vulnerabilities being introduced and improve overall security.\n\nStep 4: Policy Development\n\nOrganizations should establish policies designed to block unwanted scripts and behaviors by implementing automated technical controls, such as WCRS vendor solution policies, content security policies,1 sub-resource integrity checks,2 and other security measures. Vendor solutions that enable behavior-based policies should be leveraged to reduce high-risk behaviors, such as keystroke logging and limiting access to sensitive data fields to a specific group of trusted scripts. These policies should be designed to balance security with operational needs, ensuring that legitimate business activities are not disrupted. Regular reviews and updates to these policies are necessary to adapt to evolving threats and changes in the web application environment.\n\nStep 5: Alerts and Response to Changes\n\nTimely detection and response to security incidents are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture. Organizations should implement mechanisms for real-time alerting and monitoring of changes to client-side scripts and behaviors. This involves adapting security policies to reduce false positives and ensuring that the volume of alerts received by security operations staff is commensurate with the size of their team. Clear response protocols and escalation paths should also be established, enabling security teams to quickly address incidents and mitigate potential risk. Last, it is important to ensure continuous monitoring and adaptation of these processes in order to maintain an effective security response over time.\n\nStep 6: Third-Party Risk Management\n\nManaging risk associated with third-party scripts requires close collaboration with vendors and adherence to regulatory guidelines. Organizations with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance obligations should follow the latest PCI requirements3 and guidance on engaging third parties for script integrity checking and ensure that vendors are aware of their impact on security. On 1 August 2019, the PCI Security Standards Council issued a bulletin4 addressing the threat of online skimming to payment security. This bulletin underscores the critical need for third parties to understand their role in securing payment pages, a message that remains highly relevant for organizations today. Additionally, organizations should refer to guidance from the US Office for Civil Rights (OCR) regarding the protection of protected health information (PHI).5 By maintaining robust third-party risk management practices, organizations can ensure that their security measures extend beyond their infrastructure.\n\nStep 7: Governance and Accountability\n\nEstablishing a governance framework and regular reporting mechanisms is essential for maintaining oversight and accountability for WCRS efforts. This involves defining roles and responsibilities, setting security objectives, and tracking progress against these goals. Regular reporting to stakeholders provides visibility into the effectiveness of security measures and highlights areas for improvement. Continuous improvement processes should be implemented to allow security practices to evolve in response to emerging threats and changes in the regulatory landscape. By maintaining strong governance and reporting structures, organizations can ensure that WCRS remains a priority and is effectively managed over time.\n\nOrganizations should consider implementing governance dashboards, such as the one shown in figure 1. These dashboards may include click-through functionality, allowing stakeholders such as line of business (LOB) and technology (LOT) owners and information security, compliance, and internal audit teams to readily review the underlying information or data for their respective needs.\n\nFigure 1\u2014Example WCRS Dashboard\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWCRS is crucial for any website utilizing third-party code. Given the increasing complexity and functionality of modern websites, it is nearly impossible for commercial sites to avoid the use of third-party code during client interactions. As a result, ensuring robust WCRS measures is essential for maintaining website security.\n\nThe authors hope that the solutions covered in the second article of this series, along with the operationalization strategies outlined in this final installment, offer readers comprehensive guidance regarding the next steps for implementation within their respective organizations.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Mozilla Foundation, \u201cContent Security Policy (CSP),\u201d 10 January 2017\n\n2 Mozilla Foundation, \u201cSubresource Integrity,\u201d 21 September 2015\n\n3 PCI Security Standards Council, PCI DSS: v4.0.1\n\n4 PCI Security Standards Council, \u201cThe Threat of Online Skimming to Payment Security,\u201d 1 August 2019\n\n5 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cUse of Online Tracking Technologies by HIPAA Covered Entities and Business Associates,\u201d USA, 1 December 2022\n\nSergei Vasilevsky, CISSP\n\nIs the founder and president of ILIAM Consulting.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nLike most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface \u2014 even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.\n\nThe mantle, a zone between our planet\u2019s thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended. But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.\n\nAmong the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous \u201csupercontinents\u201d buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates. One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean. Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet\u2019s mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn\u2019t as well-stirred by Earth\u2019s internal churning as once believed. And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature.\n\n\u201cThese findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,\u201d said Claire Richardson, a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.\n\n\u201cResolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,\u201d Richardson told CNN in an email. \u201cOpen questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what\u2019s really going on down there.\u201d\n\nClues revealed by waves\n\nResearchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet. When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth\u2019s deep interior.\n\nOver the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary. Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall. However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza, lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\n\n\u201cTheir origin and whether they are long-lived structures \u2014 it\u2019s widely debated,\u201d Talavera-Soza said.\n\nEarth maps in the top row show the positions of two buried supercontinents \u2014 also called large low shear velocity provinces or LLSVPs \u2014 and how they affect speed and attenuation, or damping, of seismic waves. The bottom row shows the same LLSVPs in a cross-section view of Earth. Utrecht University\n\nEarlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents. This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.\n\nVelocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said. But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions. Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were \u201ckind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss, a professor of structure and composition of Earth\u2019s deep interior at Utrecht University.\n\n\u201cThere was no information about that,\u201d Deuss said. \u201cWe only knew that seismic waves slowed down.\u201d\n\nIn the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones\u2019 composition and activity. They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.\n\nIn music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said. Examining the attenuation of the waves \u2014 along with changes in wave speed \u2014 could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs\u2019 makeup. The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.\n\nWave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics. Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave\u2019s energy.\n\nOlder than \u2018slab graveyards\u2019\n\nThe researchers' findings could transform the understanding of plate tectonics. Here, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake leaves devastation in the Noto region of Japan's Ishikawa prefecture in January 2024. Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOther studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle. Around them were \u201cslab graveyards\u201d of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said. They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.\n\nHowever, the new model showed that while seismic waves\u2019 velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn\u2019t lose much energy. By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.\n\nResearchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures. Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time. Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study. Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.\n\n\u201cOur study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. \u201cThis implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.\u201d\n\nThis discovery follows another recent revelation about even more \u201csunken worlds\u201d that contradict the notion of a blended mantle. Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth\u2019s subduction zones \u2014 regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other. But earlier this year, another team of scientists identified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents\u2019 interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.\n\n\u201cApparently, such zones in the Earth\u2019s mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,\u201d said Thomas Schouten, lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in a statement.\n\nThe model in the new study \u2014 the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle \u2014 will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth\u2019s surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.\n\n\u201cIt maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth\u2019s interior,\u201d she said.\n\nThe findings could transform researchers\u2019 understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth\u2019s core, Deuss said. Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.\n\n\u201cThese LLSVPs have been there for a long time \u2014 if they\u2019ve been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years. They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located. We can\u2019t prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,\u201d Deuss said.\n\n\u201cFrom this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.\u201d\n\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine."

            "article_content": "OVER the last four centuries, the physical sciences have undergone a metamorphosis marked by breath-taking discoveries and the evolution of sophisticated the\u00ad\u00ad\u00adories about the nature of reality. From Isaac Newton\u2019s ground-breaking work on matter and motion, to Albert Einstein\u2019s revolutionary ideas about energy and space-time, and finally to David Bohm\u2019s hypothesis linking quantum mechanics to consciousness, each era has expanded humanity\u2019s understanding of the universe. This transition paves the way for better understanding of the interface between science and spirituality.\n\nThe groundwork for classical mechanics was laid by Sir Isaac Newton. His matter hy\u00ad\u00adpothesis postulated that the universe was composed of indivisible discrete particles called atoms, governed by invariable laws of motion and gravity. Newton\u2019s landmark work, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathe\u00admatica, integrated the motion and gravitation laws into a collected framework. He provided a predictable and perceptible understanding of natural phenomena.\n\nFor example, his equations explained how stellar bodies move in elliptical orbits. Newton\u2019s reductionist ideas formulated matter as dormant and passive, subject only to external forces. While Newton\u2019s ideology successfully elaborated macroscopic phenomena, questions about the nature of light, electromagnetic waves, and the behaviour of matter at exceedingly small scales remained unanswered.\n\nAdvances in applied physics and the discovery of phenomena such as radioactivity exposed substantial gaps in Newtonian mechanics by the early 20th century. These challenges were consummated in the innovative work of Albert Einstein, who radically reshaped humanity\u2019s understanding of energy, matter, and space-time. Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity introduced the famous equation, e=mc2. This equation smashed the Newtonian assumption of matter as inert and invariable, showing that matter is a concentrated form of energy instead. His general theory of relativity further revisited gravity as the curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy.\n\nThe boundaries between physics, spirituality, and metaphysics are fluid.\n\nEinstein\u2019s ideas replaced the deterministic framework of Newton with a relativistic model, where time and space were no longer considered absolute but rather relative to the observer. This drastic change laid the groundwork for innovations such as GPS technology and nuclear energy.\n\nDavid Bohm introduced a radical outlook that sought to desegregate the perplexing aspects of quantum mechanics with broader inquiries about reality and consciousness in the mid-20th century. Influenced by Eastern philosophy and quantum physics, Bohm hypothesised that the universe is interconnected, operating as a holistic system at all levels. His implicate order theory suggested that the visible, tactile universe (the explicate order) emanates from an elementary, enwrapped reality (the implicate order). This idea addressed the ability of particles to exhibit wave-particle duality and distant interactions, where particles influence each other expeditiously across gigantic distances.\n\nBohm\u2019s work outstretched beyond physics into the domain of consciousness, which is synonymous with awareness of God. Bohm\u2019s implicate order theory explains the mind-matter connection, suggesting that consciousness plays a role in orchestrating reality thus influencing interdisciplinary research in the realms of neurosciences, philosophy, and spirituality. Bohm\u2019s approach signifies an important shift from reductionism to a more inclusive understanding of the universe and humanity. The science that was repulsive to an idea of religious belief thus began to embrace religious ideas culminating with the discovery of the Higgs boson or \u2018God particle\u2019, completing the stan\u00ad\u00ad-dard model of particle physics. This evolution is illustrated in the Quran as: Allah \u201cbuilt the universe with great might, and We are certainly expanding it\u201d (51:47).\n\nThe progress of physical science reflects humanity\u2019s ongoing desire to understand the true nature of reality. After these step-wise calculations, we are now beginning to realise that the boundaries between physics, philosophy, spirituality, and metaphysics are fluid and not as rigid as once thought. Each archetype has not only transfigured our understanding of the physical universe but also reshaped our scientific, philosophical, and sociocultural viewpoints.\n\nThe likes of Newton, Einstein and Bohm remind us that the pursuit of knowledge is an unending journey, challenging us to expand our horizons. As we advance from the early 17th-century concept of the nonexistence of God in science towards more recent awareness of consciousness, these ideas continue to evolve into new lines of inquiry thus paving the way to connect science with the ultimate Creator of the universe.\n\nThe writer is an assistant professor at West Virginia University School of Medicine.\n\nX: @mohsinfareed\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 31st, 2025"

The Wawel Dragon\u2013or Smok Wawelski\u2013in Krakow, Poland will have to hold its fiery breath so that authorities can see why it has been guzzling too much fuel lately.\n\nKrzysztof Wojdowski, spokesman for Krakow\u2019s road infrastructure office, told the Associated Press that officials will inspect the gas lines and pipes that feed the19-feet metal dragon to look for ways to reduce energy bills. The sculpture is expected to begin to breathe fire again by March, pending the investigation.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

The beast lived in a den under Wawel Hill and terrorized the residents of King Krak\u2019s city\u2013current day Krakow. Some tales say that the beast fed on cattle, while others say it only ate young virgins. No knight was able to vanquish the beast with force, but then a young shoemaker named Skuba outsmarted the dragon. Skuba took a ram\u2019s hide and loaded it with sulfur and pitch. He placed the ram hide in front of the dragon\u2019s den as bait. The dragon ate the hide and immediately felt a shooting pain and burning in the throat. In order to quench this burning thirst, the dragon drank from the nearby Vistula River. Depending on who is telling the story, the dragon either drank so much water that it burst from fullness or the gasses produced by a mix of water and sulfur caused the dragon to explode. Either way, the beast was vanquished and the townfold\u2013and very brave shoemaker\u2013rejoiced.\n\n[ Related: Could dragons be real? Not in the way we think. ]\n\nThe fire-breathing sculpture now stands at the foot of Wawel, near the dragon\u2019s former den. Visitors can now explore into this dark cave that leads down from Wawel Hill to the banks of the Vistula River.\n\nTo see another sculpture with a fire element, you can visit Herning, Denmark\u2019s Elia. The spherical metal dome sculpture created by Ingvar Cronhammar will occasionally spout fire from a center column."

            "source": "USA Today",
            "article_content": "LIV Golf was in a position of power one year ago as it prepared for another season.\n\nFresh off the signing of the PGA Tour's Jon Rahm and fellow European star Tyrrell Hatton, the league backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund had the tour scrambling once again wondering when the poaching would stop.\n\nNow, as LIV prepares for its fourth season, perhaps it's symbolic that its first tournament, which starts Thursday, will be under the lights at night in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nBecause while the league made changes off the course, replacing Greg Norman with a new CEO and signing a television deal with Fox Sports that may or may not add significant money to the more than $900 billion in the PIF's war chest, the exodus of PGA Tour stars has gone dark.\n\nOther than insignificant changes at the bottom of its 54-man full-time roster, LIV Golf starts 2025 with no additions. This for the league that has struggled for viewership and credibility.\n\nThus, the move at the top with longtime sports executive Scott O'Neil replacing Norman, the Palm Beach Gardens resident who launched the rival league to the PGA Tour in 2022. Now, Norman is stepping aside as LIV continues its attempt to become more relevant in the golf ecosystem.\n\nGreg Norman lured Phil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka\n\nNorman helped launch LIV by luring big names such as Phil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau, Jupiter's Brooks Koepka, Jupiter's Dustin Johnson, Cameron Smith and Rahm, who could not refuse the PIF offering more than $100 million.\n\nAnd even if the actual golf has not moved the needle, LIV certain got the attention of the PGA Tour, which responded by increasing prize money and points available to its players through signature events and the Player Impact Program.\n\nThe 2025 season, though, is the beginning of a new era for LIV that will be defined by O'Neil.\n\n\"I think having an outsider \u2026 could be a very good thing when it comes to him sitting down at the table with the other governing bodies,\" Rahm said. \"I think an outside perspective, and maybe a less threatening image, might help that, as well.\"\n\nLIV was gaining momentum through the second half of 2023 after PIF leader Yasir Al-Rumayyan and PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan made the stunning announcement of a framework agreement to combine commercial businesses and rights into a new for-profit company, and dropping all lawsuits.\n\nThen came the Rahm signing six months later, giving LIV more juice as the initial Dec. 31, 2023, deadline to close a deal passed without an agreement.\n\nNow, as we reach 20 months without a deal, reports still persist that an agreement is coming. But many remain skeptical, even with O'Neil aboard.\n\nRory McIlroy, LIV's biggest antagonist among tour players, softened his criticism after the original agreement and at times has expressed optimism about the two sides uniting. But McIlroy recently expressed his disappointment with reports that fellow Northern Irelander, 22-year-old Tom McKibbin, would be joining LIV. McKibbin was raised at the same golf club as McIlroy and was being called \"the next Rory McIlroy.\"\n\nMcIlroy, who lives in Jupiter, told McKibbin, \"if I were in your shoes, I would make a different choice than the one you're thinking of making.\"\n\nMcKibbin made it official Wednesday, joining Rahm's LIV team.\n\nEugenio Chacarra: LIV only about money\n\nThe biggest issue when it comes to LIV's reputation is its inability to secure Official World Golf Ranking points, which hinders its players' ability to qualify for major championships.\n\nLIV's 54-hole, no-cut format does not meet the OWGR's criteria to quality for world ranking points.\n\nEugenio Chacarra, who won his fifth LIV start after leaving Oklahoma State in 2022, now is leaving LIV. The 24-year-old Spaniard had one top-10 finish in 2023 and 2024 and earned more than $12.6 million in three years, not including a contract reported to be around $16 million.\n\nBut he's disappointed by the broken promises and he realized money isn't everything, especially when your career is taking a hit.\n\n\"I see what it\u2019s like to win on the PGA Tour and how your life changes. How you get major access and ranking points,\" Chacarra told \"Flushing It\" golf podcast. \"On LIV, nothing changes, there is only money. It doesn\u2019t matter if you finish 30th or first. Only money. I\u2019m not a guy who wants more money. What will change my life is ... qualifying for the majors, qualifying for the Masters, the Ryder Cup.\n\n\u201cWhen I joined LIV, they promised OWGR and majors. But it didn\u2019t happen. I trusted them. But OWGR and majors still hasn\u2019t happened.\"\n\nLIV is making a lot of guys very rich, including young unproven golfers, those way past their prime and especially those who are in the sweet spot of their careers like DeChambeau, Rahm, Koepka, Hatton, Smith, North Palm Beach's Joaquin Niemann and others.\n\nBut that's come with a cost to their reputations and legacies.\n\nMcIlroy: TGL doing better job than LIV with team golf\n\nTGL, the indoor golf league created by McIlroy and Tiger Woods, has gotten off to a successful start inside its Palm Beach Gardens-based arena. Although the tech-infused league is unique and cannot be compared to anything played in fresh air and on thick, green grass, it does share the same team concept as LIV Golf.\n\nAnd McIlroy believes TGL is beating LIV at its own game.\n\n\"I think that's what TGL has done maybe a little bit better to connect with certain fan bases than, say, LIV, for example,\" McIlroy said about TGL's team concept.\n\nTGL launched with everything LIV had hoped for when it comes to the business model:\n\nBillionaires investing $50 million or more for one of six franchises with expansion expected in Year 2. LIV originally was throwing around $100 million tags to own one of its franchises and to date has not announced one sale. Instead, team captains have an ownership stake and run each franchise.\n\nA legitimate major television agreement in Year 1 like TGL has with ESPN.\n\nA deep pool of world-class golfers that includes seven of the top 10 in the current world rankings and half of the top 30.\n\nA list of popular brands as sponsors and licensing partners.\n\nMore:Why Rory McIlroy believes TGL is beating LIV Golf at its own game\n\nLIV got none of that, although it took the necessary step of moving on from the CW network and signing a multiyear rights agreement with Fox Sports starting this season.\n\n\u201cLIV Golf is getting bigger and bolder, and this relationship signals the next phase of growth as our league joins the company of the nation\u2019s premier sports leagues and conferences,\" O'Neil said in a statement when the deal with Fox was announced.\n\nO'Neil's statement that \"LIV Golf is drawing a younger, more active and tech-savvy fan base,\" is where TGL is thriving one month into its existence.\n\nTGL, playing its matches on Monday and Tuesday nights, is averaging 874,000 viewers through its first four weeks. LIV Golf's 2024 individual championship, held Sept. 13-15 in Dallas and won by Rahm, drew 89,000 viewers on Sunday when it was up against the NFL, and 134,000 on Saturday when it was opposite college football.\n\nLIV season starts Feb. 6 in Saudi Arabia under the lights\n\nLooking to get a boost from its first Fox telecast, LIV's opening week at Riyadh Golf Club will be at night. The shotgun start is at 10:15 a.m. EST, 6:15 p.m. in Riyadh.\n\nThe 2025 season opens with four international events \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore \u2013 before its first U.S. tournament at Trump National Doral April 4-6, the week before the Masters.\n\nThis is the fourth straight year LIV will hold an event at Donald Trump's course just outside Miami, the first while he is the sitting president.\n\nThe season includes eight international and six domestic events concluding with the Aug. 22-24 team championship in Plymouth, Michigan.\n\n\"To be able to watch LIV Golf on a channel that for the better part should be pretty much (on) every TV in the country, it's very good,\" Rahm said. \"Looking forward to hopefully improving (ratings) some years. A lot of improvement this year.\"\n\nTom D'Angelo is a senior sports columnist and reporter for The Palm Beach Post.

            "article_content": "Scientists have used artificial intelligence (AI) to design never-before-seen nanomaterials with the strength of carbon steel and the lightness of styrofoam.\n\nThe new nanomaterials, made using machine learning and a 3D printer, more than doubled the strength of existing designs. The scientists behind the new study said they could be used in stronger, lighter and more fuel-efficient components for airplanes and cars. They published their findings Jan. 23 in the journal Advanced Materials .\n\n\"We hope that these new material designs will eventually lead to ultra-light weight components in aerospace applications, such as planes, helicopters and spacecraft that can reduce fuel demands during flight while maintaining safety and performance,\" co-author Tobin Filleter , a professor of engineering at the University of Toronto, said in a statement . \"This can ultimately help reduce the high carbon footprint of flying.\"\n\nIn many materials, strength and toughness can often be at odds. Take a ceramic dinner plate, for example: while plates are usually strong and can carry heavy loads, their strength comes at the cost of toughness \u2014 it doesn\u2019t take much energy to make them shatter.\n\nRelated: Scientists discover revolutionary method that makes fuel from water and sunlight \u2014 but it's not finished yet\n\nThe same problem applies to nano-architectured materials, whose construction from multitudes of tiny, repeating building blocks 1/100th the thickness of a human hair makes them strong and stiff for their weight, but can also cause stress concentrations that lead to sudden breakages. So far, this tendency to shatter has limited the materials' applications.\n\n\"As I thought about this challenge, I realized that it is a perfect problem for machine learning to tackle,\" first-author Peter Serles , an engineering researcher at Caltech, said in the statement.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nTo search for better ways to design nanomaterials, the researchers simulated possible geometries for their design before passing them through a machine learning algorithm. By learning from the designs they had generated, the algorithm was able to predict the best shapes that would evenly distribute applied stresses while also carrying a heavy load.\n\nWith these shapes in hand, the researchers used a 3D printer to create their new nanolattices, finding that they could withstand a stress of 2.03 megapascals for every cubic meter per kilogram \u2014 a strength five times higher than titanium.\n\n\"This is the first time machine learning has been applied to optimize nano-architected materials, and we were shocked by the improvements,\" Serles said. \"It didn\u2019t just replicate successful geometries from the training data; it learned from what changes to the shapes worked and what didn\u2019t, enabling it to predict entirely new lattice geometries.\"\n\nThe researchers said their next steps will center on scaling up the materials until they can be used to make bigger components, while also searching for even better designs using their process. The primary aim is to design much lighter and stronger components for vehicles in the future.\n\n\"For example, if you were to replace components made of titanium on a plane with this material, you would be looking at fuel savings of 80 litres per year for every kilogram of material you replace,\" Serles said."

            "article_content": "In a nutshell: It's a long-running joke that Edge's only function is to download other browsers. But according to Microsoft boss Satya Nadella, Edge has surpassed 30% market share in the US on Windows and has taken share for the last 15 consecutive quarters. However, independent analysis puts a question mark over this statement.\n\nNadella made the revelation during Microsoft's Q2 2025 earnings call (via Seeking Alpha). He added that the Copilot consumer app is seeing increased engagement and retention with its improved speed, unique personality, and first-of-its-kind features, apparently.\n\nThe CEO went on to promote Edge and Bing as being attractive propositions for businesses. \"The investments we have made in improving our ad rates are paying off and advertisers increasingly see our network as an essential platform to optimize [return on investment],\" he added.\n\nNadella said Search and News advertising revenue had increased 21% and 20%, respectively, driven by usage from a third-party partnership. He added that growth continues to be driven by \"healthy volume growth\" in both Edge and Bing.\n\nIt's unclear where Nadella is getting his statistics for Edge usage. According to Statcounter, Edge had a 14.5% share of the desktop browser market in the US in January. That's more than the 10.9% it held in April 2021, but its share has fluctuated a lot since then \u2013 it peaked with a 16.7% share in January 2024. The likelyhood is that Microsoft is using a different metric that inflates Edge's market share \u2013 it's only counting PCs running Windows, for a start.\n\nEdge was first released alongside Windows 10 on July 29, 2015. The browser only managed to gain a tiny portion of market share during its first three years as users were less than enthralled by the offering, especially with market-leader Chrome dominating this space.\n\nEdge's fortunes improved in 2020 after Microsoft fully transitioned the browser from the original EdgeHTML engine to the Chromium open-source project, increasing security and performance while also adding support for Chrome extensions, improving web compatibility, and receiving more frequent updates.\n\nMicrosoft has never been averse to playing dirty when it comes to pushing people from Chrome onto Edge. It was reported last week that Bing search results in Edge were obscuring download links for Chrome.\n\nIn 2021, Microsoft told people that Chrome was \"so 2008\" and Edge was better. It also pushed out full-size Edge ads that appeared on the Chrome website, and Edge was accused of stealing data from Chrome without users' consent in January."

            "article_content": "In this Pharmaceutical Executive video interview, Dr. Shakthi Kumar, Chief Strategy and Business Officer, EDETEK, Inc. further explores the company's launch of R&D Cloud, emphasizing the platform's open API access, extensive library of pre-built connectors for various data sources, and real-time data and workflow capabilities.\n\nHe highlights key differentiators including the breadth and depth of integrated capabilities (covering the entire clinical trial lifecycle), robust workflow and event management, multi-SSO integration, and a state-of-the-art cloud architecture.\n\nFuture development plans include incorporating AI, expanding connectors, and specializing in additional therapeutic areas. Ultimately, the R&D Cloud aims to provide cost reduction, improved business outcomes (faster trials, real-time insights), and enhanced data quality and compliance for clients.\n\nA transcription of the conversation is available below.\n\nThe press release emphasizes the R&D Cloud's flexibility and ability to be customized. Can you elaborate on how clients can tailor their R&D Cloud environment to their specific needs and the level of control they have over the selection and integration of third-party software?\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving pharmaceutical landscape, the shift from one size fits all products and restrictive platforms to more collaborative ecosystems is truly transmitted, and many of our clients also emphasize the need for best-in-class collaboration and synergistic integration of different capabilities. At EDETEK, we've recognized this through our R&D Cloud, and it's built on two of our flagship platforms. It's eClinical for clinical trial design, execution and management and CONFORM\u2122, which is our clinical data management, aggregation, standardization and regulatory submission.\n\nClients have full flexibility in terms of selecting the capabilities they desire with either of our two platforms or with third-party software and edit tag provides the data integration and the plumbing, if you may, across the entire ecosystem, and that combined with our multi SSO integration and events driven system orchestration truly provides a very seamless collaboration and workflow, both data and human, across both internal external stakeholders, which we believe is the flexibility that the industry desires right now, and we're very excited about it.\n\nHow does the R&D Cloud address potential integration challenges and ensure seamless data flow and interoperability between different software components, both within the EDETEK ecosystem and with third-party solutions?\n\nOur R&D Cloud ecosystem is actually designed on four principles, and this is all keeping in mind the seamless data flow, the interoperability and the seamless orchestration that's desired. The first one is we make it easy for life sciences companies to integrate with various clinical sources. So how do we do this? We do this by providing an extensive library of ready to use connectors. In fact, we have over 80 different data sources that our entire R&D Cloud ecosystem right now is prebuilt, and this includes major EDC systems, central labs, imaging, PV, safety systems and various other clinical sources. All of this is facilitated through our data integration gateway, right so this makes integration much easier. It's prebuilt, and it's also very extensible.\n\nThe second one is the data and the human workflow. All of this is in real time. One is the challenges of getting data, but then the question becomes, what do you do with the data? So that has to do with collaboration and workflow, and we provide that in near real time. Our event and Collaboration Hub facilitates that particular functionality.\n\nThe third one is we provide public open API access. This is for integration and extension of our capabilities. Because, you know, when life sciences companies want to build their R&D environments, they want to build they want to tailor it, but they can also expand it, you know, working with other different partners, right? And so, the public open API access is a very important component.\n\nThe fourth one is extremely important. We call it any data, any source, any format. Our R&D Cloud provides a semantic level standardization of data, and the clients get the flexibility to customize that data models. They customize their structures with zero programming. It's all driven by metadata. And we believe that these design principles, along with a whole bunch of others, actually provides that flexibility for seamless data integration, for seamless, you know, workflow orchestration and truly building an ecosystem for our clients.\n\nWhat are the key differentiators of the EDETEK R&D Cloud compared to existing cloud-based clinical trial solutions offered by other companies in the market?\n\nWe have many key differentiators, but I'll highlight a few. The first is the breadth and depth of our capabilities I talked earlier about our two flagship platforms. Our R&D Cloud comes prebuilt with the entire suite of products for clinic, clinical trial design, execution and management, so systems like CTMS, ETMF, electronic patient reported outcomes, randomization and trial supply management, eConsent and so on. Our R&D Cloud comes prebuilt with these capabilities for clinical trial design and execution.\n\nOnce you collect the data, you also need the clinical data management and analytics capabilities that's still delivered through conform. We provide pretty much near time data collection, comprehensive data cleansing, standardization, automated, regulatory, data set generation and sophisticated visualization. And these are kind of like provides the execution part of it, and then what you really do with the data, right and the third level, which we're really excited about is because, you know, it's not just the technology our clients are looking for. They're also looking for domain specialization.\n\nWe have launched therapeutic area accelerators. For instance, a couple of months ago, we released ONCO+, which is a clinical trial accelerator just for oncology trials. And so, if you really look at it, it's not only the breadth, but also the depth and the specialization. So that's the first differentiator of the platform.\n\nThe second one, which we truly believe provides a very robust set of workflow and collaboration, is that the R&D Cloud. When you actually start building the ecosystems, you have different systems. You have different integration requirements. You have both workflow management and so on. We have an extensive set of capabilities for managing the event and the workflow within the R&D so what happens when a patient is enrolled in a particular site, you know, does it need to trigger off other events in the ecosystem, or when you collect the data, what kind of events does the R&D Cloud need to drive? And so, the event and collaboration workflow is a true differentiator and how it is actually built, because it can not only orchestrate events within our own product suite, but it can also do so for other third-party ones, right? The multi SSO integration extremely important security. Most major pharmaceutical companies, the clinical trials are running globally, and so you need to have the ability to provide that multi SSO integration across different regions, different types of user classes and groups and so on. So that actually comes, you know, pretty prebuilt within the R&D Cloud. So that is the second differentiator.\n\nThe third one is the R&D cloud is built on a state-of-the-art cloud architecture, and so there is no tying down the client to a specific environment. It's all there in cloud. I provide scalability, it provides security, reliability, speed of innovation and as well as compliance. So that's we believe makes it easier to incrementally layer our R&D Cloud into existing operating environments. And the fourth one is we provide a very intuitive, interactive visual platform. And the rule that we use is, you know, a user should be able to perform a particular function within two clicks within the entire system. We have taken care through human interface engineering that you know it is easy to use across both you know, specialized users as well as people that you know are using it for review and so on and so forth. So, we do believe that all these differentiators, along with some of the other ones will truly differentiate R&D Cloud today."

            "article_content": "A peculiar satellite image of Antarctica has sparked fresh debate over the existence of extraterrestrial life.\n\nA Google Earth user recently shared a discovery on Reddit, pointing to what appears to be a face-like figure embedded in the snow.\n\nThe image, located in a remote southeastern part of the continent, shows what some believe to be an alien-like grimace, complete with a partially closed eye, a nose, and a mouth.\n\nFound at 72\u00b000'36.0\"S 168\u00b034'40.0\"E, the mysterious formation has drawn mixed reactions. While some social media users likened it to Megatron from Transformers, skeptics quickly dismissed the sighting as an example of pareidolia-a psychological phenomenon where people perceive faces in random patterns, such as clouds, mountains, or rock formations.\n\nWhat does the science say?\n\nPareidolia is a well-documented cognitive response that causes the human brain to recognize familiar shapes, particularly faces, in ambiguous images.\n\nAccording to NASA, this is a form of apophenia, where individuals detect patterns in unrelated or random data. The Antarctic sighting, like many similar claims before it, is likely a case of the brain filling in the blanks rather than actual evidence of extraterrestrial activity.\n\nInterestingly, this isn't the first time the same satellite image has drawn attention. In 2019, conspiracy theorists claimed the formation was proof of a hidden civilization beneath Antarctica's icy surface. Though no scientific evidence supports these theories, the idea of a secret world under the frozen continent continues to fuel speculation.\n\nThe Antarctic \"alien face\" joins a long list of so-called extraterrestrial discoveries made by amateur sleuths. In 2019, conspiracy theorists claimed to have spotted alien skulls, faces, and primitive carvings in NASA's Mars photos, but scientists quickly dismissed these as natural rock formations.\n\nA particularly strange claim emerged in 2016 when some alien hunters believed they had discovered a \"facehugger crab\" on Mars. The sighting, based on an image taken by the Mars Curiosity Rover, showed a rock formation resembling a cave entrance. The resemblance to the terrifying creatures from Alien sparked wild theories among conspiracy groups.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding these supposed discoveries, no concrete scientific evidence has ever confirmed extraterrestrial life on Earth or Mars. The latest Antarctic sighting is almost certainly another case of pareidolia-an illusion rather than proof of alien activity."

            "article_content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nLike most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface \u2014 even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.\n\nThe mantle, a zone between our planet\u2019s thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended. But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.\n\nAmong the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous \u201csupercontinents\u201d buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates. One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean. Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet\u2019s mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn\u2019t as well-stirred by Earth\u2019s internal churning as once believed. And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature.\n\n\u201cThese findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,\u201d said Claire Richardson, a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.\n\n\u201cResolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,\u201d Richardson told CNN in an email. \u201cOpen questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what\u2019s really going on down there.\u201d\n\nClues revealed by waves\n\nResearchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet. When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth\u2019s deep interior.\n\nOver the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary. Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall. However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza, lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\n\n\u201cTheir origin and whether they are long-lived structures \u2014 it\u2019s widely debated,\u201d Talavera-Soza said.\n\nEarth maps in the top row show the positions of two buried supercontinents \u2014 also called large low shear velocity provinces or LLSVPs \u2014 and how they affect speed and attenuation, or damping, of seismic waves. The bottom row shows the same LLSVPs in a cross-section view of Earth. Utrecht University\n\nEarlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents. This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.\n\nVelocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said. But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions. Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were \u201ckind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss, a professor of structure and composition of Earth\u2019s deep interior at Utrecht University.\n\n\u201cThere was no information about that,\u201d Deuss said. \u201cWe only knew that seismic waves slowed down.\u201d\n\nIn the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones\u2019 composition and activity. They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.\n\nIn music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said. Examining the attenuation of the waves \u2014 along with changes in wave speed \u2014 could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs\u2019 makeup. The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.\n\nWave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics. Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave\u2019s energy.\n\nOlder than \u2018slab graveyards\u2019\n\nThe researchers' findings could transform the understanding of plate tectonics. Here, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake leaves devastation in the Noto region of Japan's Ishikawa prefecture in January 2024. Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOther studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle. Around them were \u201cslab graveyards\u201d of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said. They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.\n\nHowever, the new model showed that while seismic waves\u2019 velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn\u2019t lose much energy. By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.\n\nResearchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures. Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time. Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study. Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.\n\n\u201cOur study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. \u201cThis implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.\u201d\n\nThis discovery follows another recent revelation about even more \u201csunken worlds\u201d that contradict the notion of a blended mantle. Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth\u2019s subduction zones \u2014 regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other. But earlier this year, another team of scientists identified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents\u2019 interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.\n\n\u201cApparently, such zones in the Earth\u2019s mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,\u201d said Thomas Schouten, lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in a statement.\n\nThe model in the new study \u2014 the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle \u2014 will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth\u2019s surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.\n\n\u201cIt maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth\u2019s interior,\u201d she said.\n\nThe findings could transform researchers\u2019 understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth\u2019s core, Deuss said. Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.\n\n\u201cThese LLSVPs have been there for a long time \u2014 if they\u2019ve been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years. They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located. We can\u2019t prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,\u201d Deuss said.\n\n\u201cFrom this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.\u201d\n\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine."

To this end, the university has had a 20-kilometre-long fiber optic test track laid between specially equipped laboratories on the South and North Campus.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson, it has a diameter of 125 micrometers, i.e. just over 0.01 centimeters. The light-conducting core is only around 9 micrometers thick. By comparison, a human hair is around 60 micrometers thick, according to the data.\n\nAccording to the KIT, so-called quantum keys, which are crucial for tap-proof communication, can be transmitted via the test track. And this, in turn, is of central importance for a networked society.\n\nThreat from quantum computers underestimated\n\n\u201cQuantum communication is a key technology for future security in data transmission,\u201d says the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. \u201cIt can protect against attacks using both modern computers and powerful quantum computers.\u201d\n\nThe background to this is that quantum computers work very differently to traditional computers \u2013 namely with so-called qubits. Like a bit in a classical computer, a qubit can be in the state 1 or 0 \u2013 but also simultaneously in the state 1 and 0 or in a theoretically infinite number of states in between.\n\nQuantum computers are therefore good at solving problems that are extremely difficult for classical computers. For example, they can better simulate complex chemical systems or calculate optimal routes more quickly.\n\nAgain, this makes it relatively easy to break previous encryptions that are based on mathematical assumptions. According to the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), the threat to information security posed by quantum computers is widely underestimated.\n\nResearch for the future quantum internet\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) emphasized the importance of such technologies in the autumn in Ehningen near Stuttgart at the opening of the first quantum computing center of the US technology group IBM in Europe. In such areas, he said, we should not be dependent on other countries.\n\nOver time, KIT would like to expand the new test track into a quantum network. With this help, scientists will be able to research elements of the future quantum internet.\n\nThe project is a central infrastructure of the \u201cChem4Quant\u201d Cluster of Excellence initiative. Researchers from KIT and the universities of Ulm and Stuttgart want to develop novel qubit materials and initial components for the quantum internet. \u201cWith chemically precisely definable quantum architectures, atomically precise material structures and their quantum properties can be specifically planned,\u201d they say. For example, qubits could be positioned in electrical components with a precision below the nanometer range.\n\nImportant breakthroughs achieved\n\nThe system is also important for research into so-called quantum repeaters. These are intended to enable the secure transmission of information over long distances \u2013 similar to WLAN repeaters.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Education and Research is funding a project launched at the beginning of January with a total of 20 million euros over three years. According to Saarland University, 42 research institutions and companies are working together to develop the basic building blocks of a quantum network structure based on quantum repeaters.\n\nAccording to the BSI, the main challenge with quantum computers is their susceptibility to errors: \u201cQuantum systems are very sensitive to interference and therefore require complex error correction, which is known as quantum error correction.\u201d Recently, there have been a wealth of developments in this area that could make a cryptanalytically relevant quantum computer possible in just under ten years.\n\ndpa"
