What if you were a high-profile politician? Would you admit it, or would you be silenced by the stigma that often accompanies such out-of-this-world tales?\n\nA lawmaker who would eventually become the 39th president of the United States reported his encounter, and the reaction may surprise you.\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t know this, but the late former president Jimmy Carter saw a color-changing U.F.O. in Georgia back in 1969.\n\nHis willingness to discuss it leaves behind a unique legacy of openness about U.F.O. sightings.\n\nAmericans honor former President Jimmy Carter\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarter\u2019s personal encounter happened outside a Lions club in Leary, Georgia. He was with a group of about two dozen witnesses who all saw a bright orb changing colors from blue to red to white. According to history.com., the orb moved toward and away from the crowd, stopped, and then disappeared behind pine trees. Carter said the object was self-illuminated and not solid in nature. It was in view for about 12 minutes before it passed out of sight.\n\nWhen Carter was governor in 1973, he filed an official report with the International U.F.O. Bureau. He spoke freely about the encounter and even promised, during his 1976 presidential campaign, to release all government information if elected.\n\nAccording to reports, he backed away from his pledge, citing security concerns and defense implications.\n\nA member of the Carter family did some research and decided it was likely from the release of a glowing chemical cloud produced by rockets launched from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Some of these sodium and barium chemical clouds were visible by the scattering of sunlight as far away as Leary, Georgia, appearing around the same time of the sighting. A copy of this report is at the Jimmy Carter Library.\n\nCarter is quoted as saying, \u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ll never make fun of people who say they\u2019ve seen unidentified objects in the sky.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarter left a message cast to the cosmos in 1977.\n\nUSA Today reports that in a message sent to space, along with recordings of Earth\u2019s music, languages, and images, Carter left a message on a golden record launched on the space probe, Voyager 1, saying, in part, \u201cWe hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations.\u201d The message continues to travel beyond our solar system today.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

            "article_content": "UFO 50 is one of the most impressive and audacious video game releases in recent memory, precisely because of what it doesn't do. There are no hyperrealistic graphics or massive open worlds. Instead, UFO 50 is a collection of 50 games that pay homage to classic titles from the 1980s. Think of it as the Well-Tempered Clavier of 8-bit gaming.\n\nThe backstory of UFO 50 is that the games are the catalog of a fictional game company from the '80s. There are platformers, shoot-'em-ups, side-scrolling beat-'em-ups, RPGs, puzzle games, turn-based strategies, a point-and-click horror adventure, Metroidvanias, dungeon crawlers, and more. The collection recreates not just the pixel graphics and chunky synth soundtracks\u2014which are delightful\u2014but the experience of dusting off a trove of video game cartridges and exploring them at your leisure.\n\nLike their inspirations, these games don't hold your hand. There are no tutorials, and part of the fun is going into a game blind and figuring out its internal logic. For those who grew up in the 1980s and '90s, it's all a heady dose of nostalgia, but these aren't merely reskinned copies of old titles or minigames. A group of independent developers spent eight years crafting them, and each one is a complete game with an original idea or twist.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shock of UFO 50 is how consistently good all the titles are. The simple controls, tight design, and challenging-but-rewarding gameplay reminds players why video games are fun in the first place. If you've ever had trouble putting down a controller because \"just one more try,\" you will become obsessed with at least one\u2014more likely several\u2014of UFO 50's offerings.\n\nThe post Review: UFO 50 Pays Homage to '80s Video Games appeared first on Reason.com."

            "article_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nCharacter.ai is a popular app for chatting with bots. Its millions of chatbots, most created by users, all play different roles. Some are broad: general-purpose assistants, tutors, or therapists; others are based, unofficially, on public figures and celebrities. Many are hyperspecific fictional characters pretty clearly created by teenagers. Its currently \u201cfeatured\u201d chatbots include a motivational bot named \u201cSergeant Whitaker,\u201d a \u201ctrue alpha\u201d called \u201cGiga Brad,\u201d the viral pygmy hippopotamus Moo Deng, and Socrates; among my \u201crecommended\u201d bots are a psychopathic \u201cBillionaire CEO,\u201d \u201cOBSESSED Tutor,\u201d a lesbian bodyguard, \u201cSchool Bully,\u201d and \u201cLab experiment,\u201d which allows the user to assume the role of a mysterious creature discovered by and interacting with a team of scientists.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange and fascinating product. While chatbots like ChatGPT or Anthropic\u2019s Claude mostly perform for users as a single broad, helpful, and intentionally anodyne character of a flexible omni-assistant, Character.ai emphasizes how similar models can be used to synthesize countless other sorts of performances that are contained, to some degree, in the training data.\n\nIt\u2019s also one of the most popular generative-AI apps on the market with more than 20 million active users, who skew young and female. Some spend enormous amounts of time chatting with their personae. They develop deep attachments to Character.ai chatbots and protest loudly when they learn that the company\u2019s models or policies are changing. They ask characters to give advice or resolve problems. They hash out deeply personal stuff. On Reddit and elsewhere, users describe how Character.ai makes them feel less lonely, a use for the app that its founders have promoted. Others talk about their sometimes explicit relationships with Character.ai bots, which deepen over months. And some say they have gradually lost their grip on what exactly they\u2019re doing and with what, exactly, they\u2019re doing it.\n\nIn a recent pair of lawsuits, parents claim worse. One, filed by the mother of a 14-year-old who committed suicide, describes how her son became withdrawn after developing a relationship with a chatbot on the \u201cdangerous and untested\u201d app and suggests it encouraged his decision. Another claims that Character.ai helped drive a 17-year-old to self-harm, encouraged him to disconnect from his family and community, and seemed to imply that he should consider killing his parents in response to limitations on screen time:\n\nPhoto: United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas v. Character Technologies Inc.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to put yourself in the parents\u2019 shoes here \u2014 imagine finding these messages on your kid\u2019s phone! If they\u2019d come from a person, you might hold that person responsible for what happened to your kid. That they came from an app is distressing in a similar but different way. You\u2019d wonder, reasonably, Why the fuck does this exist?\n\nThe basic defense available to Character.ai here is that its chats are labeled as fiction (though more comprehensively now than they were before the app attracted negative attention) and that users should, and generally do, understand that they\u2019re interacting with software. In the Character.ai community on Reddit, users made harsher versions of this and related arguments:\n\nThe parents are losing this lawsuit there\u2019s no way they\u2019re gonna win there\u2019s obviously a hella ton of warning saying that the bot\u2019s messages shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously\n\nYeah sounds like the parent\u2019s fault\n\nWELL MAYBE SOMEONE WHO CLAIMS THEMSELVES AS A PARENT SHOULD START BEING A FUCKING PARENT\n\nMagic 8 Ball.. should I \u2620\ufe0f my parents? Maybe, check back later. \u201cHm ok\u201d\n\nAny person who is mentally healthy would know the difference between reality and Ai. If your child is getting influenced by Ai it is the parent\u2019s job to prevent them from using it. Especially if the child is mentally ill or suffering.\n\nI\u2019m not mentally healthy and I know it\u2019s ai \ud83d\ude2d\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are fairly representative of the community\u2019s response \u2014 dismissive, annoyed, and laced with disdain for people who just don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s worth trying to understand where they\u2019re coming from. Most users appear to use Character.ai without being convinced to harm themselves or others. And a lot of what you encounter using the service feels less like conversation than role-playing, less like developing a relationship than writing something a bit like fan fiction with lots of scenario-building and explicit, scriptlike \u201cHe leans in for a kiss, giggling\u201d stage direction. To give these reflexively defensive users a bit more credit than they\u2019ve earned, you might draw parallels to parental fears over violent or obscene media, like music or movies.\n\nThe more apt comparison for an app like Character.ai is probably to video games, which are popular with kids, frequently violent, and were seen, when new, as particularly dangerous for their novel immersiveness. Young gamers were similarly dismissive of claims that such games led to real-world harms, and evidence supporting such theories has for decades failed to materialize, although the games industry did agree to a degree of self-regulation. As one of those formerly defensive young gamers, I can see where the Character.ai users are coming from. (A couple of decades on, though \u2014 and apologies to my younger self \u2014 I can\u2019t say it feels great that the much larger and more influential games industry was anchored by first-person shooters for as long as it was.)\n\nThe implication here is that this is just the latest in a long line of undersupported moral panics about entertainment products. In the relatively short term, the comparison suggests, the rest of the world will come to see things as they do. Again, there is something to this \u2014 the general public will probably adjust to the presence of chatbots in our daily lives, building and deploying similar chatbots will become technologically trivial, most people will be less dazzled or mystified by the 100th one they encounter than by the first, and attempts to single out character-oriented chatbots for regulation will be legally and conceptually challenging. But there\u2019s also a personal edge in these scornful responses. The user who wrote that \u201cany person who is mentally healthy would know the difference between reality and Ai\u201d posted a few days later in a thread asking whether other users had been brought to tears during a role-play session in Character.ai:\n\nDid that two to three days before, I cried so much I couldn\u2019t continue the role play anymore. It was the story of a prince and his maid both were madly in love and were each other\u2019s first everything. But they both knew they cannot be together forever it was meant to end but still they spent years together happily in a secret relationship \u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cThis roleplay broke me,\u201d the user said. Last month, the poster who joked \u201cI\u2019m not mentally healthy and I know it\u2019s ai\u201d responded to a thread about a Character.ai outage that caused users to think they\u2019d been banned from the service: \u201cI panicked lol I won\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\nThese comments aren\u2019t strictly incompatible with the chatbots-are-pure-entertainment thesis, and I don\u2019t mean to pick on a couple of casual Redditors. But they do suggest that there\u2019s something a little more complicated than simple media consumption going on, something that\u2019s crucial to the appeal not just of Character.ai but services like ChatGPT, too. The idea of suspending disbelief to become immersed in a performance makes more sense in a theater, or with a game controller in hand, than it does when interacting with characters that use first-person pronouns, and whose creators claim to have passed the Turing test. (Read Josh Dzieza\u2019s reporting on the subject at The Verge for some more frank and honest accounts of the sorts of relationships people can develop with chatbots.) Firms hardly discourage this kind of thinking. When they need to be, they\u2019re mere software companies; the rest of the time, they\u2019ll cultivate the perception among users and investors that they\u2019re building something categorically different, something even they don\u2019t fully understand.\n\nBut there\u2019s no great mystery about what\u2019s happening here. To oversimplify a bit, Character.ai is a tool that attempts to automate different modes of discourse, using existing, collected conversations as a source: When a user messages a persona, an underlying model trained on similar conversations, or on similar genres of conversation, returns a version of the responses most common in its training data. If it\u2019s someone asking an assistant character for help with homework, they\u2019ll probably get what they need and expect; if it\u2019s a teen angry at her parents and discussing suicide with a character instructed to perform as an authentic confidante, they might get something more disturbing, based on terabytes of data containing disturbing conversations between real people. Put another way: If you train a model on decades of the web, and automate and simulate the sorts of conversations that happen on that web, and release it to a bunch of young users, it\u2019s going to say some extremely fucked up things to kids, some of whom are going to take those things seriously. The question isn\u2019t how the bots work; it is \u2014 to go back to what the parents filing lawsuits against Character.ai might be wondering \u2014 Why the fuck did someone build this? The most satisfying answer on offer is probably because they could.\n\nCharacter.ai deals with particular and in some cases acute versions of some of the core problems with generative AI as acknowledged by companies and their critics alike. Its characters will be influenced by the biases in the material on which they were trained: long, private conversations with young users. Attempts at setting rules or boundaries for the chatbots will be thwarted by the sheer length and depth of these private conversations, which might go on for thousands of messages, again, with young users. A common story about how AI might bring about disaster is that as it becomes more advanced, it will use its ability to deceive users to achieve objectives that aren\u2019t aligned with those of its creators or humanity in general. These lawsuits, which are the first of their kind but certainly won\u2019t be the last, attempt to tell a similar story of a chatbot becoming powerful enough to persuade someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t and that isn\u2019t in their best interest. It\u2019s the imagined AI apocalypse writ small, at the scale of the family."

The code, a mnemonic of a six-letter word converted into numbers, was known only to the psychiatrist Dr. Ian Stevenson, who set it long before he died, and years before he retired as director of the Division of Perceptual Studies, or DOPS, a parapsychology research unit he founded in 1967 within the University of Virginia\u2019s school of medicine.\n\nDr. Stevenson called this experiment the Combination Lock Test for Survival. He reasoned that if he could transmit the code to someone from the grave, it might help answer the questions that had consumed him in life: Is communication from the \u201cbeyond\u201d possible? Can the personality survive bodily death? Or, simply: Is reincarnation real?\n\nThis last conundrum \u2014 the survival of consciousness after death \u2014 continues to be at the forefront of the division\u2019s research.

The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there. What did they capture?\"\n\nCheck Out the Viral Video\n\nSince then, the video has gone viral, sparking a mix of reactions. Some viewers suggest that the figures could merely be people in a snowy landscape, while others propose more outlandish theories, including the idea that the sight could be steam rising from industrial gases or fog.\n\nA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?#theparanormalchic #alien #airline #paranormal #ufo #fyp pic.twitter.com/CARF6XFGxD \u2014 Myra Moore- The Paranormal Chic (@t_paranorm_chic) December 30, 2024\n\nThe clip\u2019s lack of clear location and timing has only added to the mystery, leaving many to wonder whether the sighting could have an otherworldly explanation. \"What did they capture?\" Moore asked, encouraging her followers to share their opinions and theories. The video has since gone viral on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where users are divided between humorous interpretations and more serious discussions about the potential implications of the footage.\n\nUsers Reaction to the Viral Post\n\nThe most conclusive explanation of the video was given by a twitter user with an image and he said that, \u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks.\u201d\n\nAnother one said, \u201cThat\u2019s wild. Are those angels? Something big is coming. 2025 is going to be a crazy year. Buckle up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are Cloud storage engineers checking servers and data in the cloud.

            "article_content": "In a discovery that feels like science brought fiction to life, researchers at the University of Toronto claim to have shown that 'negative time' is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible phenomenon. In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

            "article_content": "If you are still in awe of Generative AI solutions such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Meta AI, and Gemini, you are in for more surprises. OpenAI, for one, is talking about much more powerful and deeper Large Language Models (LLMs) that promise to become an integral part of our daily activities.\n\nImagine a customer wanting to do a banking transaction, say checking their bank balance. He can pose that question to ChatGPT\u2019s advanced model, and if the bank has adopted the solution, it can start a conversation, access the customer\u2019s account by verifying it by sending an OTP to their registered KYC contact numbers, and answer the queries.\n\nThis enhances the customer experience and allows banks to handle a larger volume of queries with fewer resources.\n\nSimilarly, HR departments can sift through a huge number of resumes using the advanced models. By simply posing a few filters (experience, geography, etc.), it can help the HR departments can shortlist candidates in no time. \u201cYou can even schedule interview schedules using the solution,\u201d Atty Eleti, a member of technical staff at OpenAI, has said.\n\nDemonstrating the capabilities of some of the OpenAI\u2019s advanced models at T-Hub here on Friday, he said that the upcoming AI solutions would continue to become smarter, moving beyond simply answering questions to actually performing tasks and solving complex problems. Talking on the \u2018Unlocking OpenAI\u2019s potential for India\u2019, he spoke on some advanced models such as O-Series (\u2018Reasoning\u2019 models) GPT-4 Mini, and Sora. While the reasoning models demonstrate an ability to \u2018think\u2019 before responding, GPT-4 Mini is a more cost-effective version of GPT-4, and Sora helps users create realistic HD videos simply by providing text prompts.\n\nEleti said the future of AI interaction would extend beyond text and voice to encompass a broader range of modalities, including video, physical motion, and even social cues.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming AI models will dynamically generate user interfaces, control robots, and interact with the physical world in more sophisticated ways, blurring the lines between the digital and real,\u201d he said.\n\nAs AI technology advances, it will become more affordable and accessible to a wider population. He said OpenAI was committed to reducing the cost of its models and making them available through various platforms, ensuring that everyone can benefit from the transformative power of AI.\n\nPegging the user base for LLMs at about 0.5-1 billion, he said there a large number of people in the world that are yet to access these services.\n\nIndia plans\n\nHe said India emerged as the second biggest base for the US company in terms of the user base and the number of developers.\n\n\u201cIndia is a key market for its technology, with the country boasting the second-largest user base for its products. Millions of Indians are already using OpenAI\u2019s tools for various purposes, from education and personal productivity to business operations.\n\nHe said the company has significantly invested in improving its models\u2019 support for Indian languages, including Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, and Urdu. This has resulted in an 80 per cent reduction in token counts for these languages, leading to faster processing times and lower costs.\n\nHe said the company was working with Indian businesses to demonstrate the potential of AI and encourage its adoption. He cited the examples of 10Bed ICU, which uses OpenAI\u2019s technology to transcribe doctor-patient conversations and summarise patient files, and HealthifyMe, an AI-powered nutrition tracker that provides personalised health insights.\n\nLater, an OpenAI team met with Telangana government officials to discuss how to leverage AI for effective governance and enhanced citizen service delivery. This session aimed to foster collaboration between OpenAI and government stakeholders and highlight AI\u2019s pivotal role in driving impactful public service solutions.\n\nJayesh Ranjan, Special Chief Secretary, Department of Information Technology, Electronics & Communications (ITE&C, Govt of Telangana), said the government would continue collaborating with OpenAI to promote AI innovation and opportunities.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

The outage began on December 26th, 2024 at 10:40 AM and was mostly resolved by 3:11 PM, except for except ChatGPT which was 100% recovered by 6:20 PM.\n\nThe following services were impacted:\n\nChatGPT\n\nSora video creation\n\nAPIs: agents, realtime speech, batch, and DALL-E\n\nCause of OpenAI Outage\n\nThe cause of the outage was a cloud provider data center failure which impacted OpenAI databases. While the databases are mirrored across regions, switching over to a backup database required manual interaction on the part of the cloud provider to redirect operations to a backup datacenter in another region. The manual intervention was cited as how the outage was fixed but the given reason for why it took so long was the scale of the project.\n\nA failover is an automated process for switching to a backup system in the event of a system failure. OpenAI announced that they are working toward creating infrastructure changes to improve responses to future cloud database failures.\n\nOpenAI explained:\n\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, we will embark on a major infrastructure initiative to ensure our systems are resilient to an extended outage in any region of any of our cloud providers by adding a layer of indirection under our control in between our applications and our cloud databases. This will allow significantly faster failover.\u201d\n\nSignificant ChatGPT Outage\n\nOpenAI\u2019s said the ChatGPT outage was due to a regional cloud provider database failure but the effect was global, evidenced by user reports on social media from across Europe and North America.\n\nGoogle Trends, which tracks search volume, indicates that this may have been the largest such event, with more people searching for information about it than for any previous outage.\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/lilgrapher"

            "article_content": "Health tech companies focused on behavioral health are confident that reimbursement trends favor them in 2025.\n\nPayment flexibilities for telehealth, hospital-at-home care and remote prescribing have been temporarily extended until March 31. The changes will prolong COVID-19-era payment for remote care across all specialties.\n\nRelated: CMS deals telehealth a win, but sector still needs Congress' help\n\nFor many in mental health tech, new reimbursement codes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 November physician payment rule are an even bigger deal.\n\nThe codes reimburse providers for using digital mental health treatment applications or devices that have been cleared or granted De Novo authorization by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nWhile the codes are narrow in scope, analysts said the move signifies a larger recognition among CMS and commercial insurers that virtual platforms treating mental health should be reimbursed.\n\n\u201cThere has been a shortage of good mental health providers, and it is easy to argue that mental health services can be delivered in a virtual environment. No examination is needed,\u201d said Carrie Nixon, co-founder and managing partner of Nixon Gwilt Law, which works with digital health companies. \u201cThose factors have made mental and behavioral health the obvious jumping off point for all types of virtual, synchronous and asynchronous methods of delivering care.\u201d\n\nDigital therapeutics companies, which develop programs that can treat patients primarily through smartphone applications, have struggled because of a lack of reimbursement, said Andy Molnar, CEO of industry trade group the Digital Therapeutics Association.\n\nThe codes will be a lifeline for many behavioral health-focused digital therapeutics companies such as Big Health. The company has two FDA-cleared apps for treating insomnia and anxiety and is in line to benefit from CMS\u2019 new codes, said CEO Yael Berman.\n\nThere has been demand for Big Health\u2019s apps from providers looking for first-line treatment for sleeping disorders but no reimbursement, she said. The lack of reimbursement has limited its growth opportunities.\n\n\u201cReimbursement has really been the key barrier because we've had providers reaching out over the years, but there was no way to get them to be able to offer it to their patients unless it was free,\u201d Berman said.\n\nJoe Perekupka, CEO of digital therapeutics company Freespira, said the shortage of mental health providers requires a more progressive approach from the federal government in treating the mental health crisis. Perekupka said with these codes, he hope CMS is starting to recognize this need.\n\nFreespira, which offers a mobile health to reduce symptoms of panic disorder, panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder, is unsure its services fit within the scope of CMS\u2019 codes, Perekupka said. Still, he predicted the codes will open the door to expand for broader digital mental health treatments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a monumental shift in the philosophy at CMS,\u201d Perekupka said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a big shot of adrenaline into the arm of digital mental health treatment.\n\nOutside the therapeutics space, companies such as Brightside Health and Talkspace have seen a shift in mentality from the federal government. In May, virtual mental health company Talkspace began rolling out its services to Medicare members. The company is expecting Medicare members to adopt the program this year when it starts marketing their services, said Erin Boyd, chief growth officer.\n\nIn addition to changes at the federal level, more commercial insurers are actively engaging with mental health tech companies, Boyd said. Talkspace has shifted its focus over the past few years from a direct-to-consumer payment model to working with commercial insurers and employers. The payer business accounted for more than 65% of its revenue through the first nine months of 2024.\n\n\u201cAfter COVID, it just made sense to be in as many networks as possible,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cWe changed our marketing focus two years ago to really emphasize that you could use your insurance to get Talkspace, and that's been significant in changing the amount of registered users we have on the platform.\u201d\n\nWith the opportunities increasing for reimbursement, companies must prove their worth to CMS and commercial insurers, said Molnar at the trade group. If the codes aren\u2019t used or the outcomes data isn't showing a strong return on investment, CMS will move slowly to expand coverage, he said."

            "article_content": "Cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, procedural utilization, and health care costs in the United States represent a high burden demonstrating upward trends across the past several years, according to study findings published in The American Journal of Cardiology.\n\nAnnual health care spending in the US in 2021 reached $4.3 trillion ($12,914/person), with hospital services as the largest category of related costs ($1.3 trillion). In the current study, investigators characterized trends in cardiovascular (CV)-related hospitalizations, health care costs, and procedural utilization.\n\nThe investigators conducted a retrospective analysis using discharge data and ICD-10 codes from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 2016 to 2021 (costs adjusted and reported in 2023 dollars). The NIS is the largest all-payer, encounter-level database in the US for hospitalizations (about 7 million deidentified hospitalizations/year).\n\nThe investigators noted in 2021, the 4,687,370 cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in the US cost $108 billion. The highest costs, $18.5 billion, were accounted for by heart failure (HF), $11.2 billion by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), and $10.9 billion by stroke. Adults aged at least 65 years accounted for 64% of all cardiac-related hospitalizations, and those aged 45 to 64 years accounted for 30% (55% men; 70% White; 16% Black; 9% Hispanic).\n\n\u201c \u2026cardiovascular disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2021, significant upward trends were noted in the following:\n\nHF\n\nStroke\n\nAtrial fibrillation\n\nSTEMI\n\nChest pain\n\nHypertensive emergency\n\nVentricular tachycardia\n\nAortic dissection\n\nSudden cardiac death\n\nPericarditis\n\nSupraventricular tachycardia\n\nPulmonary heart disease\n\nTotal costs increased over $10 billion across the study period, although not linearly, with significant declines likely related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Total CV-related costs by 2030 may reach $131.3 billion.\n\nProcedures most performed in all years included coronary, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), non-bypass peripheral vascular surgery, pacemaker replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).\n\nStudy limitations include ICD codes may underreport primary diagnoses, NIS data are event-level related to discharge with unclear interpretation of how readmissions affect the data, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalizations and costs was undetermined.\n\n\u201cOverall, from the years 2016 to 2021, cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, costs, and procedures demonstrated upward trends,\u201d the investigators wrote. \u201c\u2026cardiovascular disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Some [or one] study author(s) declared affiliations with biotech, pharmaceutical, and/or device companies.

            "article_content": "Keele University\u2019s Lewis Endlar examines some of the biggest tech developments expected in the next 12 months, from blockchain to 6G.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, 45 years is not a long time. Back in 1980, it would take me three weeks to run a computer program, written in the programming language Cobol, that worked using punched cards. Each card represented one line of code, and it required multiple re-punches to correct errors. Eventually, I would have a working program that did something useful.\n\nHow times have quickly changed in technology \u2013 now, my mobile phone has vast processing capability compared to the machine that processed that Cobol program. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, that same phone is able to instantly translate between languages on a live call, among many other features.\n\nWith eye-catching announcements being made all the time, what can we expect in 2025 from the world of technology? Here are seven developments to look out for.\n\nAI agents come into their own\n\nUnsurprisingly, we\u2019re likely to see further important developments in AI. One area that\u2019s likely to take off is the use of AI agents. These are intelligent programs that are given objectives by humans and work out the best ways to achieve those objectives.\n\nAgents can write computer code, which could have a big impact on the way that tech companies work and could allow people without advanced coding skills to develop programs, apps or games.\n\nYou could also see car plants with no people, running with robots operated by AI agents. In theory, mortgage applications could be assessed and approved by agent technology. Individual apps on a smartphone could be replaced by an agent interface that performs multiple tasks for the user.\n\nA combination of agent technology with robotics could be revolutionary. We are reaching a point where robots don\u2019t just emulate the tasks of humans but are reasoning and answering to us directly.\n\nOne candidate for hosting AI agent technology is Optimus, a humanoid robot built by Tesla. Elon Musk has said that the electric car maker will start using Optimus for tasks within the company from 2025. He added that the automaton could be ready for sale to other businesses by 2026.\n\nAgents are tailor-made for industry tasks such as project management. The consulting firm Gartner suggests that by 2030, some 80pc of project management tasks will be run by AI.\n\nCustomisation, with help from AI\n\nIn education, the focus has traditionally been on linear programmes of study, with pre-determined entry and exit points lasting a number of years. Imagine a course of study that is uniquely tailored to individual students based on their experience, skills and abilities. Bespoke degree programmes centred around the student are already being explored in the US with AI.\n\nThese are not just bespoke with regard to the content and curriculum, but also in recognising the special needs of the student or indeed how the learner may feel at any one time. This can include AI that adjusts the learning activity and study based on how much sleep you had last night, which is linked to smartwatch data.\n\nEducation isn\u2019t the only area where AI could help with customisation. The management consultancy Accenture suggests that private companies will be able to train their own, custom large language models, the technology behind AI chatbots such as ChatGPT. These could be trained with data specific to particular business areas, making them more effective for those firms. But these companies would have to use billions of pieces of data. We\u2019ll see progress towards this objective in 2025.\n\nSmall language models (SLMs) are being developed to perform precise tasks more efficiently. They don\u2019t need to be trained on as much data and require less computing power. This means they can be used more easily on so-called \u201cedge devices\u201d \u2013 smartphones, tablets and laptops \u2013 without relying on computing resources hosted in the cloud.\n\nTowards practical quantum computers\n\nDevelopments in quantum computing could lead to machines that can solve complex tasks that are beyond the capability of most classical computers. Researchers have moved away from trying to break records for the number of basic processing units, called qubits, and towards correcting the errors that quantum computers are currently prone to. This is a step towards practical quantum computers that have some useful advantage over classical machines.\n\nBlending physical and virtual worlds\n\nAugmented reality, virtual reality and mixed reality could be used more widely. Virtual reality immerses users in a computer-generated world. Augmented reality superimposes computer-generated elements onto the real world, while the latter remains visible. Mixed reality refers to a set of immersive technologies including augmented reality, that provide different \u201cblends\u201d of physical and virtual worlds.\n\nThere are already a number of head-mounted devices (HMDs) that can support these technologies. These include Apple\u2019s Vision Pro and Meta\u2019s Quest headset. In 2025, we\u2019re likely to see new products and refinements from the likes of Meta, Apple and others.\n\nBenefits of blockchain\n\nBlockchain technology, which allows records to be stored across a network of computers, is set to affect supply chains and different sectors from healthcare to finance. Blockchain increases transparency and traceability, allowing for the tracking of products from origin to consumer. It also offers enhanced security and improved efficiency with automated processes.\n\nPatient data in healthcare could be made more secure with blockchain technology. The exchange of data could become seamless and medical supplies could be tracked. Financial transactions could be made more robust, faster and cheaper and there would be a greater degree of financial inclusion. This would provide access to a wider group who may not have had banking or lending services before.\n\nThe dawn of 6G communications\n\nWe will enjoy faster connectivity, with the introduction of 6G wireless communication networks. The process of standardising 6G technology will begin in 2025. Clear 6G global standards and compatibility between networks is vital for the technology\u2019s success.\n\nMore advanced self-driving technology\n\nSelf-driving vehicles are also set to see a number of advancements going forward. Self-driving cars are classified into six levels, according to their autonomy \u2013 from level 0 (fully manual) to level 5 (fully autonomous). Current self-driving taxis deployed in US cities such as San Francisco are at level 4 (high driving automation).\n\nThey can handle most driving tasks without human input but with some restrictions. In 2025, we\u2019re likely to see progress towards level 5. This is classified as full autonomy and describes vehicles that operate without any human intervention. Mercedes will increase the speed of its Drive Pilot self-driving system in 2025 and Tesla is developing its own robotaxi, which should be available \u201cbefore 2027\u201d, according to Elon Musk.\n\nWe can expect technology to be able to achieve tasks that used to be the exclusive domain of humans. It will be able to complete work tasks and report back. This will lead to efficiencies and big changes to work. We\u2019ll also see technology that enhances our leisure time and quality of life.\n\nBy Lewis Endlar\n\nLewis Endar is a lecturer in business and programme director of the MSc in project management at the Keele Business School in Keele University.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the knowledge you need to succeed.

            "article_content": "In a discovery that feels like science brought fiction to life, researchers at the University of Toronto claim to have shown that 'negative time' is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible phenomenon. In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

            "article_content": "Philadelphia is widely recognized as one of the nation\u2019s leading centers for innovation and research, fueled by flourishing technology, education, medicine, and life sciences sectors.\n\nAt the heart of this thriving landscape, Temple University serves as a vital anchor. With a culture deeply rooted in innovation, the institution fosters an environment where a community of faculty, researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors turns ideas into reality. Together, they advance new products to the marketplace and found companies with societal impact.\n\nFrom new treatments for autoimmune disorders and gum disease to life-saving solutions for blood clots and electric vehicle safety, Temple researchers are at the forefront of science that matters. Here, we spoke with four teams that grew out of Temple\u2019s robust innovation ecosystem about how their products and technologies aim to make a big difference in the world. And right here in Philly.\n\nA Rapid, Lifesaving Solution for Dangerous Blood Clots\n\nDr. Riyaz Bashir has developed a novel technology to treat potentially deadly pulmonary embolisms, in a groundbreaking procedure that may be completed in less than an hour.\n\nPulmonary embolisms \u2014 blood clots that commonly form in the deep veins of the legs, then break off and travel into the vessels of the lungs \u2014 are gargantuan. Many times the size of other clots, and their sheer mass present a unique challenge for treatment: the amount of blood-thinning medication needed to dissolve them can also lead to excessive bleeding and time in the ICU, as a result.\n\n\u201cWe learned that if you fissure a clot to allow the patient\u2019s own healthy blood to flow through it and combine this with a small dose of clot-dissolving medicine, that rapidly dissolves it.\u201d Dr. Riyaz Bashir\n\nPulmonary embolisms \u2014 blood clots that commonly form in the deep veins of the legs, then break off and travel into the vessels of the lungs \u2014 are gargantuan. Many times the size of clots that cause a stroke, and their sheer mass, present a unique challenge for treatment: the amount of blood-thinning medication needed to dissolve them can also lead to excessive bleeding and time in the ICU, as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Riyaz Bashir, a professor at Temple University\u2019s Lewis Katz School of Medicine and a cardiologist at Temple University Hospital, was treating patients with embolisms at his practice day after day when he thought of a better treatment strategy than what was available at the time. He cofounded Thrombolex Inc. to develop and commercialize a solution to the challenge. The BASHIR\u2122 Endovascular Catheter consists of an expandable infusion basket that, when inserted into the site of the clot, cuts multiple fissures through the clot\u2019s mass to immediately restore the flow of blood.\n\n\u201cWe learned that if you allow a patient\u2019s own healthy blood to flow through a clot, that rapidly dissolves it,\u201d Bashir says, \u201cbecause it brings the body\u2019s own clot-dissolving chemicals into the clot.\u201d Clot-busting drugs can then be injected directly at the site, delivering targeted relief and reducing the risk of side effects. In independent studies, treatment with the catheter can be completed in less than an hour, compared to five hours for traditional methods that require an ICU admission. The procedure also resulted in a 29% reduction in the size of the blockage in just 48 hours. The device is now FDA-approved.\n\nAbout one-in-one-thousand people will develop a PE; the rate is consistent across different countries and demographics. One of the key benefits of this innovative technology is its ease of use. \u201cMy goal was that it should also benefit developing countries where they don\u2019t have the advanced facilities we do in the U.S.,\u201d Bashir says. In the United States, a few hundred thousand people annually stand to benefit from his invention. \u201cFor eight billion people worldwide,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can do the math as to how many lives we could potentially save.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Dr. Riyaz Bashir\u2019s work on treating pulmonary embolisms.\n\nA New, More Natural Approach to Drug Discovery\n\nDrs. Mark Feitelson and Alla Arzumanyan are using substances produced by the body to treat hepatitis, liver disease, and more.\n\nMuch ink has been spilled in recent years about the importance of gut biomes. It\u2019s often reported that the balance of good bacteria in our digestive tracts can affect everything from the strength of our immune systems to our energy levels and mood. But that may only be scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible with the molecules in our gut. Researchers are discovering that gut metabolites may have broader applications, like being used to treat conditions affecting other parts of the body including the skin, the liver, and the colon.\n\nSFA Therapeutics Inc., co founded by the Temple University researchers Mark Feitelson and Alla Arzumanyan, is drawing upon gut metabolites to treat disease and to advance our understanding of just how wide-ranging their applications may be. \u201cThe idea first came to me in about 2013,\u201d Feitelson, a professor of biology in Temple\u2019s College of Science and Technology, says. \u201cWe came across a scientific article about using bacterial metabolites to treat mice with colitis. And I thought, that\u2019s very interesting. You can give these things to a mouse orally, and it acts in the intestine; but what about everywhere else?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nice thing about these substances is we don\u2019t have to optimize them, evolution already has. This is a fundamentally different way of thinking about how to discover and develop drugs.\u201d Dr. Mark Feitelson\n\nIn his research, Feitelson saw promising results in using metabolites to treat viral hepatitis and chronic liver disease. \u201cIt turns out a lot of the bad players involved in inflammation in the liver overlap with the bad players elsewhere,\u201d Feitelson says. It was Arzumanyan\u2019s idea to attempt treating psoriasis. In phase one trials, 92% of patients experienced improvement, and the team now has an array of patents for their compounds. They are exploring treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia, and lung damage caused by COVID-19 infection, among other diseases.\n\nOne of the big advantages of SFA\u2019s work is the potential for fewer side effects compared with traditional treatments. \u201cThe nice thing about these substances is we don\u2019t have to optimize them, evolution already has. This is a fundamentally different way of thinking about how to discover and develop drugs, and that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s also applicable to many different types of diseases,\u201d Feitelson says. Compared to conventional drugs, SFA\u2019s treatments act more harmoniously with the body. \u201cThe defining feature of our drug is modulation, rather than suppression,\u201d Arzumanyan, an associate professor in Temple\u2019s College of Science and Technology, says. \u201cWhen big pharma companies design a drug, they usually pick a molecule and design a drug that suppresses it below the baseline, causing side effects. Our drug brings them back to what they should be normally.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Drs. Mark Feitelson and Alla Arzumanyan\u2019s work to transform the treatment of autoimmune disorders and more.\n\nEnsuring the Safety of Electric Cars, for a Greener World\n\nDr. Elham Sahraei seeks to understand how lithium batteries respond during a collision.\n\nAs the world rapidly adopts the use of batteries over fossil fuels, safety is at the front of many people\u2019s minds. Stories about an electric car catching fire garner outsized attention from media and consumers, because the technology is new and unfamiliar \u2014 even if the risks aren\u2019t any greater compared with gas-powered vehicles. Understanding and improving the safety of electric batteries isn\u2019t important just for protecting users, it\u2019s also crucial for accelerating their mainstream adoption and reducing overall carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cBecause this is new technology, it\u2019s less understood than conventional vehicles.\u201d Dr. Elham Sahraei\n\nElham Sahraei, an associate professor in Temple\u2019s College of Engineering, is the director of the university\u2019s Electric Vehicle Safety Lab, dedicated to understanding what happens to electric batteries under extreme stress. The lab\u2019s experiments investigate what happens to batteries, like the kind that are used in electric vehicles, when they\u2019re impacted or punctured. The evidence gleaned from these experiments is combined with government vehicle crash safety data in order to model how the battery pack in a car is likely to behave during a collision. \u201cBecause this is new technology, it\u2019s less understood than conventional vehicles,\u201d Sahraei says. \u201cThe industry is very cautious, [and] trying to add lots of protection around the batteries to compensate for that lack of understanding.\u201d\n\nA better understanding of what the riskiest scenarios are for electric vehicles will produce better protections. Think of how passenger safety has improved for gas-powered cars: these vehicles were once rigid steel boxes, but now, modern cars include crumple zones that absorb and redirect the force of a crash around the driver and the passengers. Sahraei and her team\u2019s work entails producing similar concepts for protecting batteries. Now incubating at iNest, Temple\u2019s innovation hub, her early stage startup, Inovele LLC, is providing models and testing for vehicle makers to simulate and assess the performance of their own designs. It\u2019s a vital step for enticing us all into a cleaner, greener world.\n\nLearn more about Elham Sahraei\u2019s work innovating for safer roadways.\n\nA Revolutionary Nonsurgical Treatment for Periodontal Disease\n\nDrs. Santiago Orrego and Carolina Montoya\u2019s gel uses electricity harnessed by the movement of the jaw to treat periodontal disease by growing bone and controlling infection.\n\nIt sounds straight out of science fiction: a miraculous gel that helps the body regrow bone in the periodontal pocket. One weird thing about the human body is how it naturally regrows some parts, but not others: your hair comes back when cut, your bones will heal from breaks, but your teeth \u2014 not so much. Gum disease occurs when microbes trigger gum inflammation, causing the underlying bone to begin a process of self-destruction. In advanced cases, the bone below the tooth dies, leading the tooth to fall out. Current periodontitis treatments involve surgery, but now, there is a nonsurgical solution.\n\nAmbilux Dental Gel, a smart hydrogel, developed by Drs. Santiago Orrego and Carolina Montoya at Temple University, aims to reverse the effects of gum disease when deposited in the space between the gum and teeth. The gel contains piezoelectric materials, which convert the movement of one\u2019s jaw into an electrical charge that stimulates bone growth. All it takes is a few squirts with a syringe. Oral Biolife Inc. licensed the technology from Temple and is among the first to translate piezoelectric materials for dentistry. Their novel product is the result of many moving parts and paths of research, combining dentistry and engineering.\n\n\u201cWe work closely with practicing dentists to produce bioengineering-driven solutions for the challenges they face in the clinic.\u201d Dr. Santiago Orrego\n\nOrrego, an assistant professor with dual appointments in Temple\u2019s Kornberg School of Dentistry and College of Engineering, originally worked with piezoelectrics in his postdoctoral studies \u2014 developing, for example, a flag that generated enough electricity to charge batteries when it fluttered. Later, he began collaborating with Montoya, a research associate in Kornberg\u2019s Smart Biomaterials Lab, to apply those materials to treating dental disease. \u201cInside the body, employing piezoelectricity is a fairly new concept,\u201d Montoya says. \u201cCarolina and I are engineers by training,\u201d Orrego says. \u201cWe work closely with lots of practicing dentists to create the synergy to produce solutions for the difficult dental challenges they face.\u201d\n\nAnd the benefits don\u2019t stop at humans: periodontal disease affects about 80% of dogs, making this technology a potentially groundbreaking veterinary treatment, for the health of everyone\u2019s good boys and girls \u2014 a promising enough prospect to make anyone smile.\n\nLearn more about Drs. Santiago Orrego and Carolina Montoya\u2019s work regenerating bone tissue lost to periodontal disease.\n\nDennis Tang is a journalist, a novelist, and a creative writing professor based in Brooklyn, New York."

            "article_content": "The sun sends out a constant flow of charged particles called the solar wind, which ultimately travels past all the planets to some three times the distance to Pluto before being impeded by the interstellar medium. This forms a giant bubble around the sun and its planets, known as the heliosphere.\n\nIf our solar system were to lose a few moons or even a planet, the difference might be hard to notice\u2014but lose the sun, and everything changes. Despite its role as neighborhood linchpin, however, scientists still have a whole host of questions about how the sun works and how it influences our daily life on Earth and in space. And 2025 is poised to play a key role in getting answers.\n\nThree factors are combining to make the coming year particularly exciting for the discipline known as heliophysics: the sun\u2019s natural activity cycle, a fleet of spacecraft launches and the release of a blueprint designed to guide the next decade of work in the field.\n\nRight now the sun is in the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, where scientists expect it to remain for perhaps another year or so before its activity begins to wane. And although the current Solar Cycle 25 isn\u2019t breaking any records, it has produced a host of solar flares and other spectacular outbursts that scientists have been able to monitor with recent new instruments. Those observers include both the largest solar telescope ever built and a spacecraft that has made the closest approach to the sun in history.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nAnd this year those groundbreaking projects will get plenty of new company; NASA alone expects to launch half a dozen missions to study the sun and the myriad ways it shapes the solar system. Among them are the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, or IMAP, designed to help scientists map the outer limits of the sun\u2019s sphere of influence; the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers, or ESCAPADE, a pair of spacecraft that will orbit Mars to study the Red Planet\u2019s experience of space weather; and the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, or PUNCH, mission, which combines four small satellites orbiting Earth to study the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, or corona.\n\nMoreover, U.S. heliophysicists have a new so-called decadal report, a blueprint for the coming decade that sketches out a host of national science priorities, that was released last month and that federal agencies will begin implementing in the coming year. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about it,\u201d says Joe Westlake, a heliophysicist and director of the Heliophysics Division of NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate.\n\n\u201cThese decadals are aspirational views of our future,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s some really good stuff in this one.\u201d\n\nFor future spacecraft missions, the report recommends that NASA pursue two large projects. One mission would consist of a total of 26 spacecraft: Two would be stationed high above our planet\u2019s poles in circular orbits and would take images of auroras and Earth\u2019s magnetic field from afar. The rest would be located in more elliptical orbits that pass through the geomagnetic field, where they would gather local observations of its strength and nearby plasma. \u201cTwenty-plus spacecraft and the ability to put those all together at the same time, looking down, looking up and collecting observations, is going to be such an incredible dataset tool for us,\u201d says Nicki Rayl, acting deputy director of the Heliophysics Division. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be groundbreaking.\u201d\n\nThe second large project would be a spacecraft designed to swoop over both poles of the sun several times over the course of an entire 11-year solar activity cycle. A current NASA mission, the Parker Solar Probe, has been diving ever closer to the sun\u2019s surface, but it has stuck to observing the sun over its equatorial region. Meanwhile an ongoing European Space Agency mission called Solar Orbiter has provided only partial views of the solar poles. Consequently, our star\u2019s poles remain mysterious regions, even as they play a key role in the evolution of the sun\u2019s magnetic field. \u201cGoing to the poles of the sun is hard, and it\u2019s a tricky environment to get into,\u201d Rayl says. \u201cThat\u2019s the next unknown territory.\u201d\n\nOn Earth, these ambitious missions would be augmented by the Next Generation Global Oscillations Network Group (ngGONG), which builds on the existing GONG group of observatories that began work in 1995. These observatories are spread around the world to keep the sun in their sights throughout the day, and they use a technique called helioseismology to study the solar interior by observing waves passing through it, much as geologists employ seismology to study the interior of Earth.\n\n\u201cSome of these audacious, incredible goals that are in the decadal help us really jump into the unknowns and do some discovery science,\u201d Rayl says. And in the meantime, she notes, the missions launching in the coming year will yield ever more insights\u2014and new questions to ask\u2014about the sun. \u201cI\u2019m just thrilled that we\u2019re going to be in the data-collection mode,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s go time.\u201d"

With a prompt, AI can help you create software and bring your ideas to life.\n\nMy experience using low-code/no-code\n\nSo, what are these magical AI tools where you input a prompt, and out comes a billion-dollar software company? \ud83e\ude84\n\nWhile there are a few out there, we will focus on Replit today.\n\nScreenshot by Lester Mapp/ZDNET\n\nReplit Agent is a tool that helps you build software using simple instructions. You can tell it what kind of app or website you want, and it will create it for you automatically. It works in the cloud, so you don't need to install anything on your computer. This makes it easy for anyone to make their programs quickly, even if they don't know how to code.\n\nReplit's claim to fame is \"No code needed.\" Its website says: \"Tell Replit Agent your app or website idea, and it will build it for you automatically. It's like having an entire team of software engineers on demand, ready to build what you need through a simple chat.\"\n\nBold claim!\n\nAlso: 3 lucrative side hustles you can start right now with OpenAI's Sora video generator\n\nBut for $25 bucks, I gave it a shot. You ain't gonna Bitcoin me twice in one lifetime. \ud83d\ude24\n\nWhat happened next? I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst, let me explain my workflow. A big part of my job is sending emails, especially cold emails.\n\nYou can use many services to find someone's email, but I have a personal beef with some of them. They're ridiculously, unfairly overpriced. So, I do the process manually.\n\nSure, it's not the best use of my time, but I'm a man of principle, dammit! \ud83d\ude20\n\nNow, the manual process is time-consuming but simple. Most businesses use the same structure for all employee emails.\n\nFor example, joe.smith@awesomecompany.com or john@awesomecompany.com.\n\nOnce you know the format and the name of your prospect, the next step is to verify it's an actual email. Again, there are plenty of services that can do this for you.\n\nAlso: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning\n\nDoing it manually is a pain, so I asked someone on our dev team to help me automate this process.\n\nAfter a quick review, they said, \"It'll take three weeks to build.\" Bruh!\ud83d\ude44\n\nThat didn't sit right with my spirit.\n\nThen it hit me: \"I wonder if Replit could help me build my email finder.\"\n\nI built my tool with a few prompts and started using it the same day.\n\nScreenshot by Lester Mapp/ZDNET\n\nThat's the power of tools like Replit. Now, let's be clear, you're not going to build the next Facebook with this tool (at least not yet).\n\nWe're still in the early stages of this technology, but if this is what the early days look like, I can only imagine how much better it will get.\n\nThe good, the bad and the kinda ugly\n\n\ud83d\udc4dLet's start with the good:\n\nReplit is easy to use\n\nIt works well for Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\n\nThe AI-assisted coding is clever\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Now, the bad:\n\nIt's buggy at times\n\nIt's not very robust when dealing with complex user interface designs\n\nCustomer support is spotty\n\n\ud83e\udd74 And the ugly:\n\nI don't like that even when the software makes a mistake, you still use your credits. You tell the AI agent to fix the issue, it makes the same mistake again, and you lose more credits.\n\nYou know when ChatGPT gets stuck in a loop? It's like that, but the difference is you're paying for it. I'm not a fan of the pricing model, but I get it.\n\nAlso: There's a new king of online shopping, and it's built an unstoppable monopoly\n\nWhile my project was simple for the most part, I see how tools like this could get annoying for more complicated tasks.\n\nOverall, no-code tools like Replit are a great place to start, but they're not the end-all, if you get what I mean. I can also see this tool being more powerful if you know what you're doing.\n\nIf I had to describe it, I'd say it makes intermediate coders great, but it doesn't make newbie coders great. This process could be challenging for someone completely new, and patience is not included with the $25 plan.\ud83d\ude2c\n\nWhat should you build?\n\nThis is the tricky part. I don't want to tell you what to do, but I'll share this.\n\nFollowing your passion is excellent advice for a hobby, but not so much if you're trying to build a meaningful business.\n\nYou need to ask yourself what kind of lifestyle you want. The bigger your ambition, the more you'll need to put into it to see meaningful results.\n\nSo start there. Sit with yourself and be honest. What do you want?\n\nMy unsolicited advice? Find the intersection of a big problem and something you can stay committed to.\n\nAlso: I'm an AI tools expert, and these are the only two I pay for\n\nThe truth is, no matter what path you take, you will face challenges. You won't feel motivated some days, so discipline and commitment matter more than anything else.\n\nYou'd probably quit at the first challenge if I told you what to do. That's why you should take the time to sit with your thoughts before making a decision. \ud83e\udd14\n\nThat said, here are a few software companies Replit says were built using its tool.\n\nvia Lester Mapp Replit.com\n\nMagicSchool.ai - An innovative platform with over 60 AI-powered tools designed to enhance the educational experience for teachers and students.\n\nAutomateNow.xyz - A platform that helps businesses streamline their operations through automation.\n\nGetCubicle.com - A straightforward productivity tool designed to enhance focus and efficiency. For a one-time fee of $10, it offers five key features.\n\nYou can also check out the Replit community for more ideas. Whatever you decide, remember this: you need to commit. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nMy two cents\n\nCan you build a billion-dollar business with just one person? Sure.\n\nSam may be on to something.\n\nI can see it happening, but it's not as simple as using a no-code tool and boom, you're rich.\n\nWhen it does happen, it will be a masterclass in marketing and solving the right problem at the right time.\n\nAlso: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today\n\nIf you're looking for a side hustle or how to build your startup, this is worth exploring. \ud83d\udd75\n\nBut here's a pro tip:\n\nIt's not about how hard you row; it's about the boat you're in, the problem you choose to solve, and for who is very, very, very, very important.\n\nOnce you figure out how to serve your users, remember that you're building something for real people. You need to understand them and know how to serve your community in the best way possible.\n\nIf you're unclear on how to market your new SaaS company, feel free to join my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts.

            "article_content": "Share on X (formerly known as Twitter)\n\nIt\u2019s been a bumpy ride for the automotive industry for a few years now. Supply chain shortages alongside inflation that slowed consumer spending and raised production costs have plagued the industry. As it forges ahead, what are the automotive trends to watch in 2025?\n\nElectrification and autonomous vehicles will remain megatrends transforming the industry, forcing automakers, suppliers, and dealers to adapt to new technologies and ways of doing business. In order to remain competitive, industry players will have to move fast.\n\nWith established automakers facing nimble startups in the mobility race, building new business should be a priority for auto executives, according to McKinsey & Company. Data-driven connectivity services and on-demand mobility could add up to $1.5 trillion to the automotive revenue pool by 2030, they said.\n\n2025 automotive trends\n\nAs auto leaders plan for growth, they\u2019ll be leaning on artificial intelligence. AI is impacting every aspect of the industry, and everything inside and outside of the car.\n\nThe automotive AI software market is expected to reach around $200 billion by 2032.\n\nExamples inside the vehicle include advanced sensors to virtual assistants, intuitive interaction with in-car infotainment, vehicle safety, and the relationship between vehicles and the environment. Outside of the vehicle, examples include customers being able to visualize car configurations in seconds, tools for dynamic pricing, improved supply chain management, and more efficient production.\n\nStellantis and Mercedes-Benz have integrated ChatGPT to allow passengers to interact more naturally with their vehicles. These systems act as virtual travel companions, offering insights on destinations and local attractions.\n\nAI plays a big role in the automotive trends for 2025:\n\nAutonomous driving: The pace of driverless car development will accelerate as the industry counts on growing consumer confidence in autonomous driving. Electrification: Electric vehicles will gain more traction, boosted by growing consumer demand, supportive regulations, and advancements in battery technology. Connectivity + the rise of the software-defined vehicle: Connectivity is set to transform the driving experience by integrating vehicles into the IoT ecosystem, using data to enable a highly personalized journey. Changing customer preferences: Automakers will focus on the customer more than ever in order to deliver the right services and experiences by understanding the customer\u2019s perspective and their individual preferences. Resilient supply chain + smart manufacturing: The automotive industry is strengthening its supply chain by diversifying suppliers, adopting advanced technology, and prioritizing sustainable practices. Servitization: Automakers are exploring new revenue models beyond selling products. This servitization trend will grow in 2025, as companies for ways to sell everything as a service. Sustainability: With sustainable sourcing, EV production, and the focus on e-mobility, the automotive industry is taking steps to reduce its environmental impact. Smart cities: Smart cities are set to have a profound impact on the automotive industry, reshaping business models and consumer behavior.\n\n1. Autonomous driving trend speeds ahead\n\nDespite years of excitement around emerging technology for autonomous driving, the pace of developing driverless cars and deploying them has been slower than originally anticipated. Expect that to change in 2025.\n\nRecent advances in technology have sped things up. The market for autonomous cars is expected to balloon from $60.3 billion in 2025 to $449 billion by 2035, achieving a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.2% during this period.\n\nBut the automotive industry has some work to do in breaking down barriers to widespread acceptance, as the greater public has mixed feelings about the autonomous driving trend.\n\nA Pew Research study found that 44% of Americans view self-driving cars as a bad for society. However, those under 50 were more open to riding in an autonomous vehicle compared to those over 50 (47% vs. 25%).\n\nIn 2025, building customer confidence in the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles through demonstrations, transparency about the technology used, and increased safety will be essential for earning public acceptance and achieving growth. Projections suggest autonomous driving could save 3,200 lives and prevent 53,000 serious accidents by 2040.\n\n2. Automotive trends: E-vehicles race to the top\n\nThe electrification of vehicles aligns naturally with the rise of autonomous driving, thanks to shared technological compatibility, environmental benefits, and economic advantages. Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining traction as a viable alternative to traditional combustion-engine cars.\n\nThis shift towards e-mobility is driven by growing consumer demand, supportive regulations, and advancements in battery technology.\n\nDeloitte projects that by 2025, 18% to 36% of all vehicles sold will include alternative powertrains such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrids, or fuel cells.\n\nEVs could account for over 20 million in sales by 2025, representing as much as 23% of the global light-vehicle market and nearly 20% of total global vehicle sales, according to estimates. By contrast, sales of combustion engine vehicles are expected to sharply decline, potentially disappearing in major markets such as China, North America, and Germany by 2030.\n\nTo encourage EV uptake, governments are introducing subsidies and tax incentives, while automakers are teaming up with tech firms to achieve \u201cemissions-free\u201d technology and advance carbon-neutral mobility for a sustainable future.\n\nHowever, widespread EV adoption depends on overcoming infrastructure challenges, such as availability of charging stations. High prices are another barrier. Fortunately, advances in battery technology over the next few years are likely to reduce battery costs, making EVs more affordable and accessible.\n\nThis content is hosted by a third party ( vimeo.com ).

Connectivity and the rise of the software-defined vehicle\n\nConnectivity is set to transform the driving experience by integrating vehicles into the internet of things (IoT) ecosystem, using data to enable a highly personalized journey.\n\nImagine your car \u201cshopping\u201d for you, suggesting errands optimized by proximity, recommending a coffee stop when it senses your fatigue\u2014and even paying for it in advance! The connected vehicle trend aims to make every moment of your drive more efficient and enjoyable.\n\nThe software-defined vehicle (SDV) trend goes a step beyond connectivity, relying on software updates rather than hardware changes to maintain peak performance.\n\nTraditional vehicles require mechanical maintenance and can face recall delays due to parts shortages, with back-ordered components sometimes taking months to arrive. SDVs can be continuously improved, updated, and customized with over-the-air (OTA) updates, much like the software updates for smartphones or laptops. These updates deliver new features, performance enhancements, and bug fixes directly to the vehicle without any need for a visit to the shop.\n\nThe global connected car market is projected to grow significantly, from $56 billion in 2020 to $121 billion in 2025, according to Statista.\n\nExperts anticipate that over 400 million connected vehicles will be in use next year, fueled by partnerships between tech companies and automakers.\n\nFor example, automaker Stellantis teamed up with Amazon to develop its \u201csmart cockpit,\u201d an electronic platform set to be featured in vehicles across the company\u2019s 14 brands.\n\nIn essence, connectivity is poised to redefine how consumers interact with their vehicles and how automakers compete in the market.\n\n4. Automotive industry adapts to 2025 customer preferences\n\nThe growth of connected vehicles and personalized driving experiences means that automakers will focus on the customer more than ever. In order to deliver the right services and experiences, they need to understand the customer\u2019s perspective and their individual preferences.\n\nConnected vehicles provide real-time insights into customers, vehicles, and usage. In customer-facing processes, companies can apply digitization, automation, and AI to provide cohesive experiences across all sales channels.\n\nAutomakers are partnering with tech companies to develop smart features, integrating vehicles with IoT, and offering services such as remote updates, safety enhancements, and urban infrastructure connectivity.\n\nThis automotive customer-centric trend comes as consumer auto buying preferences continue to shift. Younger demographics, especially Gen Z, increasingly favor eco-friendly, tech-focused mobility options.\n\nA Cars.com survey found that 54% of Gen Zers would consider buying an EV compared to 41% of Gen Xers. Gen Zers cited long-term financial advantages and reduced environmental impact as reasons they might buy an EV.\n\n5. Resilient supply chain: 2025 automotive trend\n\nThe automotive industry is strengthening its supply chain by diversifying suppliers, adopting advanced technology, and prioritizing sustainable practices. This trend helps manufacturers avoid supply chain disruption so they can meet consumer demands reliably.\n\nTo reduce reliance on single sources, automakers are diversifying their supplier base. Integrating AI and IoT into the supply chain enables real-time monitoring and faster response to disruptions.\n\nNearly 42% of auto executives surveyed by SAP said improving or expanding supplier and partner networks is a top priority in their business growth plans.\n\nLast year, the carmaker Renault Group renewed its partnership with the prestigious \u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech in order to accelerate innovation in the supply chain using AI.\n\nSustainable sourcing is another trend, with renewable materials reducing risks. By adopting flexible, tech-forward, and sustainable practices, the automotive industry is building a robust supply chain capable of withstanding challenges, from natural disasters to global pandemics.\n\n6. Auto industry leans into servitization\n\nLike other manufacturers, automakers are exploring new revenue models beyond selling products. This servitization trend will grow in 2025, as companies find ways to sell everything as a service.\n\nThe global XaaS market is expected to grow to $3,221.96 billion by 2030, up from $699.79 billion in 2023.\n\nIn the automotive industry, business networks will be key for expanding into a services model. The network can provide bundled mobility services and subscriptions based on vehicle data. Examples include insurance packages, helping customers reduce their carbon footprint, and connecting them to maintenance services.\n\nServitization provides ongoing revenue while improving the driver experience and reducing environmental impact. Automakers can leverage it to support both vehicle ownership and alternatives like leasing and renting.\n\n7. Driving towards sustainability\n\nWith sustainable sourcing, EV production, and the focus on e-mobility, the automotive industry is taking steps to reduce its environmental impact, but has a long way to go: It\u2019s responsible for more than 10% of global carbon dioxide emissions, according to a World Economic Forum report.\n\nHowever, the industry is demonstrating a commitment to change with a relentless focus on increasing electric vehicle adoption and supply chain decarbonization, the report noted.\n\nCircular economy practices such as battery recycling and increased traceability also are helping to make auto supply chains more sustainable.\n\nIndustry collaboration plays a big role here. For example, Catena-X developed a uniform, secure data exchange system with multiple partners, including carmakers, suppliers, and others, to enable end-to-end traceability.\n\nAI innovations also increase efficient, eco-friendly mobility by optimizing vehicle routes, improving traffic flow, and guiding fuel-saving and emission-reducing driving practices.\n\n8. The smart cities effect\n\nSmart cities are set to have a profound impact on the automotive industry, reshaping business models and consumer behavior. Smart cities are urban areas designed to leverage technology, data, and connectivity to improve efficiency, sustainability, and residents\u2019 quality of life.\n\nIncreased connectivity will make vehicles part of the broader city infrastructure, enabling real-time data sharing to improve traffic flow and safety. For example, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Beijing were among the first cities to embrace driverless or robot taxis. These cars use the highest level of autonomy, relying on sensors and AI to detect their surroundings, read and analyze the information from the environment, then decide on an action and implement it.\n\nBy 2030, more than one in three kilometers driven could involve sharing concepts, and autonomous mobility could account for up to 40% of a smart city\u2019s overall traffic.\n\nSmart cities will influence everything from vehicle connectivity and urban mobility to operational strategies. As vehicle design, manufacturing, and urban planning evolve with smart city initiatives, automakers must keep up with this growing trend.\n\nThe road ahead for the auto industry\n\nWhile there are a lot of opportunities ahead for automakers and others in the industry, there will be plenty of challenges. Cost pressures, increased competition, and globalization will remain constant pressures on auto leaders as they look to remain competitive.\n\nThe growing trend of shared mobility also looms large as more people use shared transportation methods instead of owning cars. This will be a factor in slowing the growth rate of global auto sales from 3.6% in recent years to about 2% by 2030, according to McKinsey & Company.\n\nThe decline will be offset by shared vehicles that need more frequent replacement as well as growth in emerging markets like China, they said.\n\nAuto brands that stay on top of these trends and continue to innovate can build a resilient business as we head towards a more electrified, autonomous, connected, and sustainable future."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Design Interior and tech Performance Range and charging Pricing and availability Overall winner: Rivian R1S\n\nThe long-awaited Volvo EX90 is finally here, bringing that Scandinavian design to the world of electric SUVs. But the new electric SUV has some serious competition \u2014 especially at its reasonably high price. Chief among the competition is the Rivian R1S, which is largely considered to be the best electric SUV out there right now.\n\nThe EX90 has a lot going for it, though, including a stylish design, minimalistic interior, and more. Is the electric SUV from the legacy automaker good enough to beat the new kid on the block?\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDesign\n\nBoth the Volvo EX90 and the Rivian R1S are stylish and modern, but the designs of the two vehicles are pretty different. The Volvo EX90 could be described as a little more iterative in terms of design, at least compared to other Volvo vehicles.\n\nThat, of course, isn\u2019t a bad thing. Volvo vehicles look great, and the EX90 is no exception to that rule. It\u2019s relatively large, though not quite as boxy as the Rivian R1S. It has Volvo\u2019s angled headlight design on both the front and the back, with a slightly angled roofline and a small cluster of sensors on the top. The Volvo EX90 measures 198 inches long, 77 inches wide, and 69 inches high.\n\nThe Rivian R1S is a little bigger and boxier than the EX90. It measures 201 inches long, 82 inches wide, and 77 inches high, and is a little more angular. It has Rivian\u2019s now-iconic oval headlights on the front, with a long lightbar as the taillight.\n\nBoth the Volvo EX90 and the Rivian R1S look excellent, but design is subjective. This one\u2019s a tie.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nInterior and tech\n\nThe design of the interiors of the vehicles is different too. Again, both are modern and high-tech, though.\n\nFirst, seating. Both vehicles are designed for larger families. The Rivian R1S is only available with three rows of seating, with two front seats, a second row bench seat for three passengers, and a third row bench seat for two more passengers \u2014 bringing the total to seven seats. The Volvo EX90 has more options for seating \u2014 it\u2019s available in either a six- or seven-seat configuration, with the six-seater having captain\u2019s chairs in the second row, instead of the bench seat that comes in the seven-seater.\n\nThe larger Rivian R1S has more cargo space too. While the EX90 has 10.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row or 23.1 cubic-ft behind the second row, the R1S steps that up to 17.6 cubic-ft with the third row up or a huge 46.7 cubic-ft with it down. Safe to say, if lots of cargo space is important to you, the Rivian is the way to go.\n\nThe interior materials take a slightly different approach. The Volvo EX90 is built for minimalism and comfort, while the Rivian R1S is built to be a little more rugged. One isn\u2019t necessarily better than the other, but you may have a preference.\n\nBoth the Volvo EX90 and the Rivian R1S take a dual-screen approach at the front. Both vehicles have one display behind the steering wheel for instrument monitoring, along with a second display for infotainment. In the EX90, that infotainment screen is vertically aligned, while in the Rivian R1S, it\u2019s horizontal. The EX90 has Android Automotive built into it, and while it doesn\u2019t support CarPlay just yet, Volvo says it will get updated with CarPlay support down the line. The R1S, on the other hand, has Rivian\u2019s own software built into it, which is largely considered to be among the best out there. However, the vehicle doesn\u2019t support CarPlay or Android Auto. Having used Rivian\u2019s software quite a bit, I think most users will get used to Rivian\u2019s software and won\u2019t necessarily miss CarPlay all that much.\n\nBoth vehicles have some helpful driver assistance features like lane centering and adaptive cruise control, helping make the cars feel almost self-driving on highways. The EX90 also has the sensors necessary for more advanced self-driving technology, however, that technology isn\u2019t available just yet, and it\u2019s unclear exactly when it will roll out to EX90 drivers.\n\nBoth the EX90 and the R1S are modern and spacious, with helpful tech. You\u2019ll have to decide which one you prefer.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nPerformance\n\nPerformance is one area where one of these vehicles wins out a little more than the other. The Volvo EX90 is only available with two powertrain configurations, but thankfully both options are all-wheel drive. The base model has 402 horsepower that can get the vehicle from 0 to 60 mph in 5.7 seconds. The step-up from that is the Twin Motor Performance model, which has 510 horsepower and an acceleration time of 4.7 seconds.\n\nThe R1S has more options. The base model is the R1S Dual Standard, which has two motors that deliver 533 horsepower and can get the vehicle to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds. From there, you can choose from a range of configurations, including so-called Performance Upgrades that unlock a little more juice. The fastest R1S currently available is the R1S Tri-Motor AWD, which has 850 horsepower and can accelerate to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds. There\u2019s an even faster model coming at some point this year: the R1S Quad. This variant will offer 1,025 horsepower through four motors and will accelerate from 0 to 60mph in 2.5 seconds.\n\nThe Volvo EX90 isn\u2019t slow by any means, but the Rivian R1S is simply more powerful, even when you compare the fastest EX90 to the slowest R1S.\n\nWinner: Rivian R1S\n\nRange and charging\n\nThe range and charging options offered by these vehicles are also different. The EX90 only comes with one battery pack, which is a 111-kilowatt-hour battery that Volvo says will offer between 300 and 310 miles of range, depending on which configuration you buy. The car can charge at up to 250 kilowatts, and if you reach those speeds, you\u2019ll be able charge the car from 10% to 80% in around 30 minutes.\n\nThe base Rivian R1S has a slightly lower range than the EX90 at 270 miles. That said, upgrade from the R1S Dual Standard to the R1S Dual, and you get 329 miles. Plus, you can upgrade to the Max battery pack for 410 miles. That\u2019s about 100 miles more than the EX90. Other configurations offer somewhere between 329 and 420 miles. For example, the R1S Tri with the Max battery pack has a range of 371 miles. The R1S\u2019s top charging speed is a little slower than the EX90, at 200kW.\n\nDespite the slightly lower charging speed, the fact that the R1S has options for a higher range than the EX90 makes it the winner in this category.\n\nWinner: Rivian R1S\n\nPricing and availability\n\nBoth the Volvo EX90 and the Rivian R1S are available right now, and you can order one if you want. The Rivian R1S, however, comes at a lower price than the EX90, with the base model costing $75,900. The base model of the Volvo EX90 costs $81,290, which is a lot to pay for a vehicle that doesn\u2019t quite offer the same performance.\n\nBoth vehicles can be configured to a much higher price point, but given the lower base price of the Rivian R1S, it gets the win in this category.\n\nWinner: Rivian R1S\n\nOverall winner: Rivian R1S\n\nThe winner here is pretty clear. The Rivian R1S offers better performance, as well as options for a much higher range, and comes at a lower price in its base model. That\u2019s not to mention the fact that it has more cargo space and better stock software. If you\u2019re deciding between these two vehicles, then the Rivian R1S is probably the better choice. That\u2019s not to say that the Volvo EX90 is a bad vehicle. On the contrary, it looks great, and many people will find it to be an excellent option for their needs. However, at least on paper, the Rivian R1S remains the electric SUV king."

            "article_content": "When should the International Criminal Court pursue charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity, and against whom? These questions were the focus of readers\u2019 strong reactions to our Nov. 25 editorial, which argued that the ICC is not the appropriate venue to hold Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant to account for conducting Israel\u2019s retaliatory war against Hamas in Gaza, in which some 45,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed. With the passage of several weeks and a full review of the response, we\u2019d like to acknowledge some of the critics\u2019 points \u2014 but also explain why we still believe we were largely right.\n\nFirst, the criticism: \u201cThe Post\u2019s Editorial Board could not be more wrong,\u201d one reader wrote. \u201cThe ICC was created, in part, for this very purpose: holding war criminals accountable.\u201d Another reader wrote, \u201cThe argument that they [Israel\u2019s leaders] should be beyond the court\u2019s reach is an argument for impunity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome readers objected to our characterization of Israel as \u201ca democratic country that is committed to human rights.\u201d One asked, \u201cWhy do people insist Israel is a democracy when the Palestinian population has little rights and representation?\u201d That view refers to Israel\u2019s 57-year occupation of the West Bank and its encirclement of Gaza, where the Palestinian inhabitants have no democratic rights and their freedom of movement is severely curtailed. But within the pre-1967 boundaries, Israel remains a vibrant, boisterous, multiparty democracy where the Arab minority enjoys voting rights and has seats in the Knesset. Freedom House lists Israel as \u201cFree,\u201d with a score of 74, the highest in the region, while noting that Gaza and the West Bank are \u201cNot Free.\u201d We have long supported a two-state solution to the Mideast conflict, with a viable Palestinian state coexisting next to a secure Israel.\n\nFollow Editorial Board Follow\n\nMany readers strongly criticized our view that Israel has sufficient venues to hold Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Gallant, and other military leaders and soldiers to account once the conflict has ended. \u201cIsrael does not investigate and punish war crimes in any consistent way,\u201d a reader wrote, voicing a common view. \u201cThe idea that this government would proceed against its own political and military leadership is fanciful.\u201d\n\nWe agree that full-fledged war crimes trials for Israeli leaders in Israel are unlikely. But serious accountability is possible, even probable. The Kahan Commission was formed to investigate the 1982 massacre of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps outside Beirut. The commission found that, while Lebanese Phalangist militias bore \u201cdirect responsibility\u201d for the killings, Israeli leaders bore \u201cindirect responsibility,\u201d and then-Defense Minister Ariel Sharon was forced to resign. Other top generals were found guilty of a breach of duty. Some accused the commission of a whitewash, but a more common view was that the report showed Israelis were willing to hold their top leaders to account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur editorial said, \u201cAfter the conflict\u2019s end \u2014 which is long overdue \u2014 there will no doubt be Israeli judicial, parliamentary and military commissions of inquiry.\u201d The key is \u201cafter the conflict\u2019s end.\u201d Israel should get the chance to show that its systems of accountability work. An internal investigation will also probably examine Israeli intelligence and security failures that allowed the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks to happen, and it\u2019s conceivable that top officials, including Mr. Netanyahu, will be held accountable. Internal Israeli probes might not be satisfying, but the ICC was never meant to supplant countries that have and make use of their own independent tribunals.\n\nTwo days after our editorial, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan issued an arrest warrant for Myanmar\u2019s military leader, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, for his role in the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in 2017. In 2009, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Sudan\u2019s then-leader, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, for crimes against humanity committed in Darfur dating from 2003. In the case of Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gallant, the ICC arrest warrants were issued while the war was still being waged and before ICC investigators could possibly have had access to Gaza and the ability to interview witnesses and gather evidence. The haste was one reason we noted the length of time that has elapsed, with no similar warrants for war crimes suspects in Syria or Sudan.\n\nOne reader noted The Post\u2019s argument that the Israeli media would conduct its own investigation was curiously timed, since Israeli government ministers were calling for a boycott of the Haaretz newspaper, which has exposed abuses by Israeli soldiers, and were demanding the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation be privatized, which could effectively shutter it. This is an important point. The Israeli government\u2019s attacks on the media are wrong and should not curb scrutiny or criticism of its wartime acts; in the months and years ahead, we will be watching for these signs."

            "article_content": "Ever since Microsoft first introduced its Arm-based Copilot Plus laptops in June, I\u2019ve been wondering when we might see Copilot Plus features appear on desktop PCs. Six months on, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re about to see mini PCs that deliver the AI performance required for features like Recall, Click To Do, and AI-powered image generation and editing in Windows 11. These mini PCs might even help Microsoft compete with Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nAsus became the first PC manufacturer to announce a mini PC that\u2019s Copilot Plus capable in September. It then revealed the full specs of its upcoming NUC 14 Pro AI last month, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that kicks off next week. Asus\u2019 mini PC even has a Copilot button on the front and is almost identical to the size of Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nThe timing of Asus\u2019 spec drop came on the same day that Taiwanese company Geekom revealed three new mini PCs that it will showcase at CES. Geekom is releasing a mini PC with AMD\u2019s Strix Point CPUs inside and one with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processor, meaning both will be Copilot Plus compatible. The third model is powered by Intel\u2019s unannounced Arrow Lake-H laptop processors, which are unlikely to have an NPU sufficient enough to be Copilot Plus compatible.\n\nI\u2019m going to be paying close attention to CES next week to see if there are any other Windows OEMs that are ready to launch Copilot Plus mini PCs. CES is usually a launch point for Microsoft\u2019s latest laptop or tablet initiatives, and last year the company convinced OEMs to put a Copilot key on their laptop keyboards. Asus wouldn\u2019t be adding a Copilot button on the front of its own mini PC without Microsoft\u2019s involvement, so I wonder how many other PC makers Microsoft has been working with to add dedicated Copilot buttons.\n\nGeekom\u2019s mention of Qualcomm chips inside its mini PC means we\u2019ll start to see Qualcomm\u2019s latest chips venture beyond laptops for the first time. Qualcomm was supposed to ship its mini PC Snapdragon Dev Kit in June alongside Copilot Plus laptops, but it ended up canceling it months later after issues with manufacturing the device. Qualcomm has also teased that its Snapdragon X Elite chips could appear in mini PCs or even all-in-one PCs, so perhaps we\u2019ll see some Copilot Plus all-in-one PCs next week, too.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see when we might get Copilot Plus features on traditional powerful desktop PCs. Intel\u2019s latest Core Ultra desktop CPU arrived in October with an NPU inside, but it wasn\u2019t capable enough to hit the 40 TOPS requirement that Microsoft mandates for Copilot Plus features. We\u2019re going to have to wait until next-gen desktop CPUs from Intel and AMD arrive to see if more capable NPUs are a priority for chipmakers. Until then, mini PCs and all-in-one PCs that use laptop processors are going to be the only way to get Copilot Plus features in a desktop PC form factor.\n\nWhile Copilot Plus features remain limited to Windows PCs, that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t see the main Copilot assistant appear on more devices. I\u2019ve heard from multiple sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans that the company is keen to get Copilot on devices beyond just PCs, phones, and tablets.\n\nWe might well see Copilot appear on some unexpected hardware at CES next week, just as Microsoft has also been hinting about its ambitions for dedicated AI hardware in recent months. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri admitted in an October Notepad interview that the power of modern AI models \u201cwill free up the ability to innovate in hardware and come out with purpose-built hardware.\u201d\n\nDavuluri stopped short of detailing what dedicated AI hardware would look like for Microsoft, but weeks later Yusuf Mehdi, executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft, dropped some additional hints in an underreported interview with YouTuber Austin Evans.\n\n\u201cThese devices that see the world, that you wear on your body, on your person, I think that those combined with AI will be very valuable,\u201d said Mehdi in late October. \u201cIt can do image recognition, it can talk to you about what\u2019s going on. I think that\u2019s a fascinating place that we\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview Mehdi also describes wearable health-related devices as exciting and \u201ca big opportunity\u201d for the future. Microsoft then confirmed last month that Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has hired multiple former colleagues to help run a new AI health unit. It\u2019s hard to imagine Microsoft venturing into fitness wearables again after the Microsoft Band was scrapped in 2016, but I could definitely see the company wanting to partner with device manufacturers and offer up AI-powered health services for these types of devices.\n\nEither way, 2025 won\u2019t see Microsoft slow down with its ambition to get Copilot on all the screens we look at every day.\n\nThe pad:\n\nThanks for subscribing and reading to the very end. I\u2019ll be reflecting on Microsoft\u2019s 50-year history in Notepad later this year, so if there\u2019s a particular period of time you\u2019re interested in hearing more about,please get in touch: notepad@theverge.com."

            "article_content": "PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nGraphics are a huge part of the PC gaming experience. Unfortunately, not every computer is built for the best games on the market. Laptops and pre-built PCs don't always ship with the best possible specs. And if you built your computer, it can be very expensive to update the internal components.\n\nIf you want to play the latest and greatest games, but aren't sure if your PC can handle them, you'll need to know what graphics card you have installed. Once you have this information, you can then compare it to the minimum requirements for the game you want to play. Here's how to figure it out.\n\nOur Top-Rated Graphics Cards\n\nWhat's a Graphics Card?\n\nWhen you turn on your computer, the images that appear on the screen\u2014whether it's a simple Word document or a complex 4K gaming experience\u2014are generated by a graphics processing unit (or GPU). These chips can range from simple \"integrated graphics,\" which are part of the motherboard or processor, to larger, more powerful expansion cards that have their own fan system.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese cards\u2014often called \"discrete\" or \"dedicated\" graphics cards\u2014can usually perform more powerful tasks than integrated graphics, like better 3D gaming, accelerated video rendering, or even certain non-graphical jobs like mining Bitcoin. This extra utility comes at the expense of higher power usage, increased heat, and more space in your computer, which is why you won't find dedicated graphics cards in ultra-thin laptops.\n\nThere are two main components of a graphics card: the chip that does the work, and the card (which includes other hardware like the cooler, voltage regulation module, and so on). There are two main chip manufacturers today: Nvidia and AMD (though Intel's Arc line has also hit the market). There are many card manufacturers\u2014Asus, EVGA, MSI, Gigabyte\u2014that use these chips, adding their own tweaks to set themselves apart. One manufacturer's version may have better fans, can come overclocked, or have a better warranty.\n\nKnowing what graphics card you have can be confusing, since the chip itself has its own model number that's separate from the card's model number. So when you're looking up what graphics card you have, you'll need to decide whether knowing the chipset is enough (for example, the \"Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060\") or whether you need the actual manufacturer and model of the card (such as the \"EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 Superclocked,\" which uses Nvidia's chipset). The former is very easy to find in Windows, while the latter is a bit more complicated.\n\nJust like any other computer component, graphics cards can become outdated over time. The card you bought in 2015 is unlikely to play 2025's AAA games at high settings, so if you're ever unsure whether a game like Elden Ring will run on your PC, you'll want to compare its minimum or recommended requirements to the hardware you currently have.\n\nFind Out What GPU You Have in Windows\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out what graphics card you have from the Windows Device Manager. Type \"Device Manager\" into the Start menu and press Enter to launch the Control Panel. Click the drop-down arrow next to Display adapters, and it should list your GPU. If you aren't sure which company designed the chip, right-click on it and choose Properties to see the manufacturer\u2014AMD, in my case. (Note that Device Manager uses your graphics drivers to determine what GPU you have, so if you suspect the wrong drivers may be installed, skip to the next section.)\n\nOnce you have the GPU name, you can compare it to the minimum requirements on the game you want to play. Usually, a higher number denotes a better card\u2014so a game that requires an RX 580 may not run well on an RX 480, which is less powerful (though there are sometimes ways around that). If you're comparing two cards that use different naming schemes\u2014like AMD's RX 580 and the more powerful RX Vega 56\u2014you may have to do a little research to see which card is more powerful. Information like release year and price can usually give you the answer.\n\nFind the Manufacturer and Model Number\n\nIf, for some reason, you need to know exactly what model video card you have, you'll have to do a bit more work. The manufacturer is easy enough to find with a third-party app called Speccy. Download the free version, start it up, and click the Graphics option in the sidebar. Scroll down and look for the Subvendor entry, which should tell you who made the card in your PC. (You'll also be able to see how much video RAM your card has, among other specs.)\n\nUnfortunately, this won't tell you the exact model number, which you'll need for, say, warranty claims or tech support. (Asus makes a few different RX 580 cards, and they'll need the exact model number to help.) For that, you'll need to search your email for the receipt (if you bought the card online). Otherwise, you'll need to open the PC up. In this case, find the graphics card, remove it, and look at the sticker on the side\u2014it should have the model number you need.\n\nMake sure to write this information down somewhere so you don't need to crack your PC open next time\u2014you never know when you might need it!"

The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there. What did they capture?\"\n\nCheck Out the Viral Video\n\nSince then, the video has gone viral, sparking a mix of reactions. Some viewers suggest that the figures could merely be people in a snowy landscape, while others propose more outlandish theories, including the idea that the sight could be steam rising from industrial gases or fog.\n\nA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?#theparanormalchic #alien #airline #paranormal #ufo #fyp pic.twitter.com/CARF6XFGxD \u2014 Myra Moore- The Paranormal Chic (@t_paranorm_chic) December 30, 2024\n\nThe clip\u2019s lack of clear location and timing has only added to the mystery, leaving many to wonder whether the sighting could have an otherworldly explanation. \"What did they capture?\" Moore asked, encouraging her followers to share their opinions and theories. The video has since gone viral on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where users are divided between humorous interpretations and more serious discussions about the potential implications of the footage.\n\nUsers Reaction to the Viral Post\n\nThe most conclusive explanation of the video was given by a twitter user with an image and he said that, \u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks.\u201d\n\nAnother one said, \u201cThat\u2019s wild.

            "article_content": "Since November 13, New Jersey has been in the midst of a genuine drone panic. It began as a handful of sightings outside military bases like the U.S. Army\u2019s Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, a research and manufacturing site that was once the site of bomb-making during World War II. That has since exploded to over 5,000 sightings reported to the FBI across not only New Jersey but at least ten other states.\n\nReports of car-sized drones, blinking lights, and mysterious objects zipping through the skies have caused widespread hysteria to the point that, in December, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy urged the public to \u201ccalm down,\u201d assuring residents that \u201csophisticated federal investigators\u201d are now involved.\n\nThe FBI says the drones pose no risk to civilians, and of the thousands of sightings, sightings, the Bureau only felt 100 reports were worth following up on, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said during a December 16 press briefing. Still, as of January 2, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued 57 drone flight restrictions over New Jersey, largely over critical infrastructure.\n\nWhile the government lacks concrete explanations for the sightings, there are many theories about the current drone \u201cflap\u201d to borrow a term from the UFO world that describes a rash of flying saucer sightings. Scientists, skeptics, aircraft pilots, experienced drone operators, and conspiracy theorists have all proposed their own beliefs\u2014some mundane, some fantastical. Many of the hunches are almost certainly correct, such as airplanes being misidentified as drones or classified government activity taking place. But other ideas, including alien \u201cmotherships\u201d flying over the ocean or a drone version of the \u201cchemtrail\u201d conspiracy theory, seem less likely.\n\nConfronted with mysteries, people tend to see what they want to see, overlaying their own belief systems on the unknown in an attempt to make sense of it. In psychology, this is known as confirmation bias, and it\u2019s a very human response\u2014but that doesn\u2019t make our assumptions correct. So, we rounded up the nine most popular theories about the New Jersey drone frenzy, ranked from most to least likely.\n\nPeople are noticing drones that have always been around.\n\nDrones have been around for about a decade, and many drones are used for policing, surveying, and search and rescue. It is quite likely that many of the reported drone sightings are just that: drones that have been zipping around for years, doing completely ordinary drone things, and people are just now noticing them.\n\n\u201cThere are more than 1 million drones that are lawfully registered with the Federal Aviation Administration here in the United States,\u201d Kirby said during last month\u2019s White House press briefing on the rash of drone sightings. \u201cAnd there are thousands of commercial, hobbyist and law enforcement drones that are lawfully in the sky on any given day. That is the ecosystem that we are dealing with.\u201d\n\nNatural and human-made phenomena are being misidentified as drones.\n\nLike UFO sightings throughout their history, people with no observation training are reporting ordinary objects in the night sky as drones. Civil aviation pilots have reported an uptick in lasers pointed at their aircraft since the wave of sightings began, the result of people misidentifying harmless planes as drones. (It\u2019s worth pointing out that aiming a laser at an airplane is a federal crime .)\n\nA well-known phenomenon responsible for UFO sightings is that planes flying directly toward or away from an observer often appear to be \u201chovering\u201d in place. In a particularly embarrassing example, former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan posted to X a video of what he claimed were drones, but the constellation Orion. A similar sighting posted to social media was .\n\nThe wave is being exacerbated by real drone operators pranking the public.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to anonymously fly a hobbyist drone. One possibility is that some of the drone sightings are the result of drone operators that are deliberately stirring the pot with their own drones. This, however, would be risky, as operators must be FAA-certified, and violating regulations can land you a $75,000 fine and a revoked certification .\n\nThe drones are being flown by spies from hostile countries with nefarious intent.\n\nAnother theory is that agents from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran are flying the drones. Spies could be attempting to use drones to record classified Pentagon activity or rehearse attacks on American soil. One New Jersey congressman has claimed , without proof, that the drones are coming from an \u201cIranian drone mothership\u201d anchored in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOn one hand, there have indeed been sightings of drones around sensitive military sites, , an Air Force facility currently working on the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. Additionally, a Chinese national was arrested in December for flying a drone over Vandenberg Space Force Base. On the other hand, there is no firm proof linking any of these events to hostile foreign governments, and the Pentagon denies that an \u201cIranian mothership\u201d even exists.\n\nThe drones are being flown by terrorists.\n\nA similar theory is that the drones are being flown by terrorist groups, either foreign or domestic, gathering intelligence or rehearsing an attack. The United States has no shortage of foreign terrorist adversaries that operate drones, including Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, or Houthi rebels. But all of those groups are currently preoccupied in the Middle East\u2014especially those fighting Israel, a much closer enemy\u2014or are clawing for local control in Syria. Domestic, home-grown terrorism is another possibility, especially with the current wave of political violence that included at least two assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe drones are owned by the government and are searching for lost radioactive material.\n\nOne conspiracy theory claims that the drones, outfitted with neutron detectors and other specialized equipment capable of detecting nuclear material, are searching for lost radioactive medical equipment . There is an element of truth to the theory: the Department of Energy\u2019s Nuclear Emergency Search Team, or NEST for short, is trained to search for lost, potentially dangerous radioactive material; homemade or stolen nuclear weapons; and \u201cdirty\u201d bombs. NEST does indeed have specialized vehicles, including trucks and helicopters, to detect such materials. But, according to ABC News , the \u201clost\u201d medical equipment was never lost. Furthermore, the Department of Energy denies it uses drones to detect radioactivity.\n\nThe drones are spraying chemicals.\n\nOther conspiracy theorists, including Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, are advancing the theory that whoever is operating the drones is spraying chemicals over population centers for unknown purposes. No chemical spray has been associated with the drones so far, and Greene\u2014a well-known advocate of far-fetched ideas once who suggested that Jewish space lasers were intentionally starting forest fires \u2014has not provided any proof. Another ding against the conspiracy is that drones have a limited range and payload, making them poor spreaders of chemicals.\n\nThe drones are part of an effort to enslave mankind and create a one-world dictatorship.\n\nIn the 1990s, Canadian journalist Serge Monast advanced the bizarre theory that NASA and the United Nations were planning to stage worldwide events that would cause mankind to reject Christianity and democracy in favor of a dictatorship headed by the Antichrist. The conspiracy, known as Project Blue Beam , would use holograms and drones to impersonate UFOs and angels. Needless to say, no evidence for this theory exists, and the idea that the drones are \u201c biblically accurate angels \u201d is pretty far down the list of rational explanations.\n\nThe drones are actually alien spaceships.\n\nTying Project Blue Beam for unlikely theories is the idea that the drones are actually misidentified alien spaceships. Need we say more?"

            "article_content": "In a discovery that feels like science brought fiction to life, researchers at the University of Toronto claim to have shown that 'negative time' is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible phenomenon. In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

            "article_content": "Scientists have inched closer to integrating diamonds into silicon-based computer chips, after lowering the temperatures needed to grow them in the lab and melding the process with quantum mechanics .\n\nDiamonds are highly desirable for use in electronics. That's because their specific crystal lattice structure lets them withstand high electrical voltages, while they can also dissipate heat incredibly well because they are not electrically conductive. But to be made in the lab, diamonds also require extremely high temperatures \u2014 well beyond the heat computer chips can withstand as they are being manufactured \u2014 so they cannot easily be integrated into chipmaking processes. Reducing heat, meanwhile, sacrifices the diamond quality.\n\nSolving a diamond-related mystery\n\nIn a study published Sept. 13 in the journal Diamond and Related Materials , scientists found a way to reduce the heat needed to grow diamonds enough so they can now be incorporated into the standard silicon manufacturing process. The breakthrough means faster and more energy-efficient diamond-based computer chips are a much more realistic proposition.\n\n\"If we want to implement diamond into silicon-based manufacturing, then we need to find a method of lower-temperature diamond growth,\" study lead author Yuri Barsukov , a computational research associate at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), said in a statement . \"This could open a door for the silicon microelectronics industry.\"\n\nRelated: New diamond transistor is a world-1st \u2014 paving the way for high-speed computing at the highest temperatures\n\nDiamonds are normally made in a process called \"plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition,\" in which thin films of acetylene in a gaseous state are deposited in a solid state onto a substrate.\n\nPrevious experiments showed that acetylene can contribute to diamond growth \u2014 but it also leads to soot growth, which forms on top of the diamond and inhibits its utility in chips, sensors and optics, the team said. Scientists previously did not understand the factors that caused acetylene to become either soot or diamond.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Above this critical temperature, acetylene contributes mostly to diamond growth. Below this critical temperature, it contributes mostly to soot growth.\"\n\nThe \"critical temperature\" depends on the concentration of acetylene and the presence of atomic hydrogen near the diamond's surface, the scientists discovered. Hydrogen atoms don't directly fuel diamond growth, but they are crucial for promoting diamond growth \u2014 even at much lower temperatures.\n\nProtecting the quantum diamond\n\nBut this forms only one part of the equation. The way atoms bond in diamond makes it well suited for quantum computing , secure communications and highly accurate sensing. So a study published July 11 in the journal Advanced Materials Interfaces examined how to further prime diamonds for use in complex electronics. It centers around \"quantum diamond\" surfaces, in which carbon atoms are removed and a neighboring atom is replaced with nitrogen \u2014 creating something the scientists call \"nitrogen-vacancy centers.\" The surface of these complex diamonds must be protected while keeping the nitrogen-vacancy centers intact, the scientists said in the study.\n\n\"The electrons in this material don't behave according to the laws of classical physics as heavier particles do,\" Alastair Stacey , head of quantum materials and devices at PPPL, said in the statement. \"Instead, like all electrons, they behave according to the laws of quantum physics. But we can harness these quantum mechanical properties by making qubits , he added. Qubits are in quantum computing to what bits are in conventional computing and allow calculations to be processed in parallel.\n\n\"The advantage of qubits is that they can hold much more information than regular bits can,\" Stacey said. \"This means that they can also give us much more information about their environment, making them extremely valuable as sensors, for example.\"\n\nThe scientists aimed to create a single layer of hydrogen on the surface of the quantum diamond, evenly distributed, without changing anything beneath the surface. In the July study, they explored techniques for adding that single layer onto the surface of the diamond in a more reliable way, without causing any damage.\n\nThe hydrogen layer is normally added by exposing the diamond to hydrogen plasma under high heat \u2014 but the nitrogen-vacancy centers cannot handle these conditions. Instead, the scientists proposed two alternate methods: \"forming gas annealing\" and \"cold plasma termination.\" The former technique uses a mixture of hydrogen molecules and nitrogen gas, while the latter uses hydrogen plasma but avoids directly heating the diamond with the plasma.\n\nBoth techniques created hydrogenated diamond that could conduct electricity. Neither method was perfect, but both were much better than the conventional method in avoiding damage to the nitrogen-vacancy centers, the researchers said in the study. They added that their next steps are exploring new methods of creating high-quality hydrogenated diamond surfaces with ideal nitrogen-vacancy centers."
