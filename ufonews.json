Here are the best UFO documentaries and docuseries to stream now.\n\nFrom Linda Napolitano's story of being taken by three non-human figures in Netflix's The Manhattan Alien Abduction to students' chilling tale of being warned by aliens to take better care of the planet in Apple TV+'s Ariel Phenomenon, these 11 documentaries provide some answers and even more questions.\n\nWhile investigations into alien encounters, alleged government secrets and UFO sightings have yet to prove anything definitive, these unexplained mysteries do make for thought-provoking entertainment.\n\nWhether or not humans are alone in the universe is a controversial question \u2014 and one that many filmmakers have attempted to answer.\n\n01 of 11 The Manhattan Alien Abduction The Manhattan Alien Abduction on Netflix.

The site became forever associated with aliens after an interview in 1989.\n\nFormer government physicist, Robert Lazar, told a Las Vegas news station that the site housed and studied alien spacecraft. He has said it was his job to to recreate the technology for military use, according to National Geographic.\n\nOther top cities for UFO sightings include Portland, Oregon, in fourth place with 279 reports, and Tuscon, Arizona, ranked fifth with 244 .\n\nRoswell was dubbed the 'UFO capital of the world' following an alleged spaceship crash in 1947 known as the 'Roswell Incident'.

Robert Hastings spoke to News Nation, explaining how UFOs have been visiting Earth\u2019s nuclear missile bases.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\n\u201cI can tell you that all the major nuclear missile bases, from the ones operational in the 60s and the 70s, and the ones that are currently operational, have been visited repeatedly year after year according to the sources that I have interviewed,\u201d he says in the viral clip. \u201cA public, grass roots effort must be made in the interim to understand \u2013 as best as possible, using the data gathered thus far \u2013 the nature and intentions of those who pilot the UFOs. Or perhaps they have a use for our planet, let\u2019s say for scientific purposes, and know that global nuclear warfare will disrupt their data-gathering and/or experiments.\u201d\n\nHastings is a longtime member of the UFO community, stemming from his experience as a teenager working at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls, Montana. He was a janitor in the air traffic control tower and in March 1967, he and the FAA and USAF controllers witnessed radar tracking a handful of UFOs near nuclear missile silos.\n\nAfter his education, Hastings started a stretch being a speaker at hundreds of colleges and universities in the U.S. about UFOs and the alleged coverup by the U.S. government. He has interviewed countless people about the topic over the years and penned the book, UFOs & Nukes: Extraordinary Encounters at Nuclear Weapons Sites.\n\nAs the Daily Star adds, the viral clip on the heels of former Army Director Colonel Karl E. Nell with the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Task Force claiming he has proof of \u201cnon-human intelligence\u201d contacting life here on Earth and how they have affected humanity.\n\n\u201cNon-human intelligence exists, non-human intelligence has been interacting with humans on this planet and this interaction is ongoing and is not new \u2013 there is zero doubt. There is zero doubt this is absolutely true \u2013 I know this personally,\u201d he said during a New Paradigm Institute conference recently. He didn\u2019t shared this personal info, though, which keeps the debate alive. Maybe one day we\u2019ll get a nugget of truth about what is actually going on, or at least a lie that is easier to swallow."

Any license that could aid Huawei's AI efforts would likely be denied.\n\nTSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo after its chip matched the one found on the Huawei AI processor, sources told Reuters last month.\n\nReuters could not determine how the chip ended up on Huawei's Ascend 910B, released in 2022, viewed as the most advanced AI chip available from a Chinese company.\n\nThe latest clampdown hits many more companies and will allow the US to assess whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor.\n\nAs a result of the letter, TSMC notified affected clients that it was suspending shipments of chips starting Monday, the person said.\n\nThe Commerce Department declined comment."

Microsoft is planning to go the Apple route with its branding efforts for \u201cWindows Intelligence\u201d, also known as AI in Windows 11. We first picked up the news when references to \u201cWindows Intelligence\u201d were spotted in a Group Policy, and now Microsoft is building a dedicated Settings page for \u201cWI\u201d.\n\nLike every other tech giant, Microsoft wants us to use AI in Windows 11 in one way or another. In fact, most of the promised AI features aren\u2019t even here, including the controversial Windows Recall and the interesting \u201cClick to Do\u201d. They\u2019re all coming and more features are planned, but how is Microsoft planning to market the big update?\n\nWindows Intelligence. This is the answer. According to references in Windows 11, Windows Intelligence could be the new umbrella term for all the AI features. Ahead of the announcement, Microsoft is also preparing a dedicated Settings page for Windows Intelligence AI features.\n\nAs noticed by Albacore on X, new placeholders for the upcoming privacy page confirm that \u201cWindows Intelligence\u201d is a thing. It would be the new name for \u201cGenerative AI\u201d settings Microsoft has been testing.\n\nWindows Latest was able to turn on the hidden \u201cGenerative AI\u201d page in the Settings. While it shows up as \u201cGenerative AI\u201d in our screenshot, it\u2019s getting rebranded to \u201cWindows Intelligence\u201d. That would be the name when the feature goes live in Windows 11.\n\nAs shown in the screenshot, the first toggle controls \u201cWindows Intelligence access.\u201d It lets users decide if apps on their device can access generative AI features\u201d. The second setting, \u201cLet apps use generative AI,\u201d is for managing permissions, allowing you to control which specific apps can utilize AI capabilities.\n\nThe \u201cRecent activity\u201d section shows a history of AI requests within the last 7 days, providing transparency into which apps have accessed AI features. This could allow you to review past actions, such as when an app tried to access NPU or apps that might have access to AI-related features.\n\nIt\u2019s supposed to give more transparency over how AI is being used on Windows 11. We think it looks like the existing recent activity log for apps that might have accessed the mic and camera in Windows 11.\n\nLast but not least, Microsoft will also let you turn on or off Windows Intelligence system-wide or user-wide (if you\u2019ve multiple accounts).\n\nIn addition, Microsoft previously explored a dedicated page in Settings for managing \u201cAI Components\u201c, including managing updates for \u201cAI Components\u201d on Windows Update. This is according to references to \u201cAI component updates\u201d in musupdatehandlers2.dll.mui.\n\nWhen is it coming to Windows 11? A release date is uncertain, but Microsoft could still announce \u201cWindows Intelligence\u201d or tease it in some way by the end of the year, or we might learn more about it in early 2025."

        "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) agents can be a more effective tool compared to large language models (LLMs) or GenAI applications, opening up new possibilities to drive enterprise productivity and program delivery through business process automation, British professional services firm Deloitte said in a study.\n\nWith the aid of an AI agent, cases that were previously deemed too complex for GenAI can now be enabled at scale in a secure and effective manner, the study said.\n\nBy definition, the AI agent is an autonomous intelligent system that uses AI techniques to interact with its environment, collect data, and perform tasks without human intervention.\n\nExplaining the difference between Gen AI and AI agents, the study adds that typical LLM-powered chatbots usually have limited ability to understand multistep prompts.\n\n\"They (LLM or Gen AI) conform to the \"input-output\" paradigm of traditional applications and can get confused when presented with a request that must be deconstructed into multiple smaller tasks. They also struggle to reason over sequences, such as compositional tasks that require consideration of temporal and textual contexts. These limitations are even more pronounced when using small language models (SLMs), which, because they are trained on smaller volumes of data, typically sacrifice depth of knowledge and/or quality of outputs in favour of improved computational cost and speed,\" it said.\n\nThe study says that GenAI use cases have mostly been limited to standalone applications such as generating personalised ads based on a customer's search history and reviewing contracts, among others.\n\nOn the other hand, AI agents excel in addressing the limitations while also leveraging the capabilities of domain- and task-specific digital tools to complete more complicated tasks effectively. \"AI agents equipped with long-term memory can remember customer and constituent interactions--including emails, chat sessions and phone calls--across digital channels, continuously learning and adjusting personalised recommendations. This contrasts with typical LLMs and SLMs, which are often limited to session-specific information,\" the study adds.\n\nThe study further adds that while individual AI agents can offer valuable enhancements, businesses also need multiagent AI systems, given the limitations of single AI agents. However, the study notes that AI agents also introduce new risks that necessitate robust security and governance structures.\n\n\"A significant risk is potential bias in AI. algorithms and training data, which can lead to inequitable decisions. Additionally, AI agents can be vulnerable to data breaches and cyberattacks, compromising sensitive information and data integrity,\" it adds.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

        "article_content": "Charles Fort pioneered the paranormal and invented alien abductions The Book Of The Damned author was no crank or fraud, but someone who questioned everything.\n\nWe explore some of Wikipedia\u2019s oddities in our 6,922,857-part monthly series, Wiki Wormhole.\n\nThis month\u2019s entry: Charles Fort\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: From Mulder and Scully to Mabel and Dipper, inquisitive minds have long sought to peer beyond the veil of mystery and find the world\u2019s hidden truths. The early 20th century\u2019s foremost believer that the truth was out there was Charles Fort, a writer who wrote about what Wikipedia calls \u201cscientific anomalies,\u201d starting with his first book in 1919, the scientifically titled The Book Of The Damned. 1970s occult magazine The Fortean Times cemented Fort as the first name in strange phenomena.\n\nBiggest controversy: It\u2019s hard to tell how earnest Fort actually was. He once said \u201cI believe nothing of my own that I have ever written,\u201d and UFO writer Jerome Clark called him \u201cessentially a satirist.\u201d At the same time, his curiosity was genuine, and some of his writing had real merit. While he was interested in poltergeists, teleportation (he\u2019s believed to have coined the term), and may have been the first person ever to write about alien abduction, Fort was also fascinated by legitimate scientific phenomena that science had no explanation for\u2014ball lightning, phantom cats (big cats found well outside their natural geographic range), and unexplained disappearances.\n\nThe simplest explanation seems to be not that Fort was a crank or a fraud, but that he questioned everything unexplained, real or not.\n\nStrangest fact: Fort\u2019s friends started a Fortean society and had to trick him into joining. A group of writers including Ben Hecht, Theodore Dreiser, Alexander Woollcott, and Fort\u2019s editor Tiffany Thayer, organized a Fortean Society in 1931, full of writers who admired his ideas. But Fort himself was \u201clured to its inaugural meeting by false telegrams.\u201d Fort objected to the group, surmising that it would quickly fill up with true believers in the occult, and not questioners and skeptics as he was. He refused the presidency of his own fan club, and Dreiser had to step in in his place.\n\nThe Society petered out when Thayer died in 1959, but much of their materials passed to the International Fortean Organization (INFO), which started in the early \u201960s and still exists. The Fortean Times magazine began publishing monthly in 1973, and is still in circulation in the U.K.\n\nThing we were happiest to learn: While Fort is hardly a household name, he casts a long shadow. Sci-fi writers, including Philip K. Dick, Robert Heinlein, and Robert Anton Wilson, have all noted him as an influence. Alfred Bester\u2019s novel The Stars My Destination names the first teleporter after Ford. And Stephen King mentions Fort in several books (the parents of the child at the center of Firestarter are advised to read Fort instead of Dr. Spock). Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s 1999 film Magnolia is full of unexplained events drawn from Fort, (among other things, Fort was fascinated by animals falling from the sky without explanation), and a scene set in a library has one of Fort\u2019s books on display.\n\nThing we were unhappiest to learn: It was likely trauma that pushed Fort into Forteana. His father, a Dutch-born grocer, was authoritarian and abusive, so young Charles escaped as best he could, into books and nature. While he wasn\u2019t a good student, he was a voracious reader, and collected shells, minerals, and birds, with an eye towards being a naturalist. He escaped in a larger sense as soon as he turned 18, traveling around the western U.S., the U.K., and southern Africa, where he fell ill. (He was nursed back to health by a childhood friend, Anna Filing, who he soon married). But then another cruel fate befell Fort\u2014he became a freelance writer. He likely would have struggled on working odd jobs and publishing the odd piece in newspapers and magazines, except a wealthy uncle left him an inheritance large enough to let him quit his job and focus on writing about the truly odd.\n\nBest link to elsewhere on Wikipedia: One of the oldest strange phenomena Fort wrote about was spontaneous human combustion. Scientific debate still rages on whether the phenomena is real, but no one can deny that in rare instances, human remains have been found destroyed by an explosion with no apparent cause. Reports go back as far as 1731, when Italian Countess Cornelia Zangari Bandi was found dead one morning\u2014rather, her lower legs, three fingers, and part of her skull were found amidst a heap of ash in her bedroom. The case was famous enough that Dickens mentions the Countess in Bleak House, and the \u201cpossibility of what is called spontaneous combustion.\u201d\n\nScience\u2019s best guess at an explanation is that these incidents are not spontaneous, but caused by an external source like a cigarette, which ignites alcohol on the victim\u2019s clothes, and their body fat adds fuel to the fire. (Heavy drinking and low mobility that would prevent an escape do seem to be common factors in many spontaneous combustion cases).\n\nFurther down the Wormhole: Usually we take a few twists and turns to get to our next topic, but it\u2019s hard to resist going straight for List of Reportedly Haunted Locations. (Oddly enough, one of the Haunted Locations is named Charles Fort, but it\u2019s a fort in Ireland built for English King Charles II during Britain\u2019s long occupation of Ireland.) We\u2019ll find out whether we are or ain\u2019t \u2018fraid of no ghost next month."

It can be frightening for some and enticing for others.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about \u201cstigmatized properties,\u201d which the National Association of Realtors describes as being \u201cpsychologically impacted by events such as murder, suicide, alleged hauntings or [a] notorious previous owner.\u201d It might also include homes known for criminal activity. A natural death can sometimes create a stigma as well.\n\nDon't miss\n\nAccredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger \u2014 and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger.

Here's how\n\nIf there are whispers between neighbors of a home for sale that\u2019s host to the paranormal, or even if the owner died recently, it can place sellers in the tricky situation of whether or not they\u2019re required to disclose such details to prospective buyers. That\u2019s not always the case \u2014 we\u2019ll explain below \u2014 but word of mouth might be enough to affect sales prospects.\n\nHere\u2019s how to handle a stigmatized property sale if you land in a similar situation.\n\nWhat sellers need to know\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine how a haunting can be confirmed, but according to an analysis by Zillow, four U.S. states have real estate disclosure laws that mention paranormal activity.\n\nNew York courts can rescind a home sale if the owner previously established a reputation that the house was haunted and then sold it to an unwitting buyer. Similarly, in New Jersey, a seller must disclose \u201ca property purportedly being haunted\u201d if asked by the buyer. Massachusetts and Minnesota, on the other hand, simply mention paranormal or supernatural activity as a \u201cpsychologically affected\u201d attribute that doesn\u2019t require disclosure.\n\nThe disturbing news of a death in a home can give some potential buyers the jitters, and eight states have laws that compel sellers to disclose a death on the property, per the analysis.\n\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\n\nCalifornian sellers must disclose a death on the property, natural or otherwise, within three years, per the analysis. In Alaska, a murder or suicide within one year must be disclosed. In South Dakota, a seller must disclose if a homicide or suicide occurred on the property. In New Hampshire, a homicide or suicide on the property must be disclosed if asked. Georgia and New Jersey sellers must disclose any deaths if asked.\n\nStory Continues"

        "article_content": "For a very long time, we have been under the impression that memory and learning are solely the brain\u2019s forte. Central to this belief is the fact that our brains, particularly our brain cells, store memories.\n\nHowever, an innovative team of researchers begs to differ, suggesting that cells in other parts of the body partake in this memory function too.\n\nThe ability of non-brain cells to learn and form memories is a riveting discovery.\n\nThis thought-provoking study provides us with a new understanding of memory\u2019s mechanisms and paves the way for potential advancements in learning and memory-related afflictions treatment.\n\nUnderstanding memory \u2014 the basics\n\nMemory is like your brain\u2019s personal filing system. When you experience something new \u2014 like meeting a friend or learning a fact \u2014 your brain encodes that information by turning it into patterns of neural activity.\n\nThese patterns get stored in different parts of your brain, depending on what type of information it is. For example, visual memories might be stored in areas responsible for processing images, while facts and numbers find their way into regions that handle language and logic.\n\nRetrieving memories happens when your brain needs to access those stored patterns. It\u2019s similar to searching for a file on your computer.\n\nIf you want to remember your friend\u2019s birthday, your brain activates the relevant neural pathways to bring that information back into your conscious mind.\n\nSometimes, this process is seamless, but other times memories can be a bit fuzzy or mixed up, especially if they\u2019re not accessed frequently. That\u2019s why you might struggle to recall something you haven\u2019t thought about in a while.\n\nYour memory isn\u2019t perfect, and it can change over time. Each time you recall a memory, your brain might update it with new information or emotions, which can make the memory stronger or slightly different from the original event. Factors like sleep, stress, and even nutrition can influence how well your memory works.\n\nMemory formation and cells\n\n\u201cLearning and memory are generally associated with brains and brain cells alone, but our study shows that other cells in the body can learn and form memories, too,\u201d explains New York University\u2019s Nikolay V. Kukushkin , the lead author of the study.\n\nThe goal of the research was straightforward \u2014 to investigate if non-brain cells contribute to memory. To do this, the scientists deployed the time-honored neurological property, known as the massed-space effect.\n\nThis principle asserts that our retention capacity is better when information is studied in spaced intervals rather than crammed into a single, intensive session.\n\nDoes this strike a chord? We have all experienced the futility of last-minute cramming before tests.\n\nMemory test in non-brain cells\n\nIn this study, the scientists simulated the process of spaced learning by examining two types of non-brain human cells \u2014 one from nerve tissue and one from kidney tissue \u2014 in a laboratory setting.\n\nThese cells were exposed to varying patterns of chemical signals, akin to the exposure of brain cells to neurotransmitter patterns when we learn new information.\n\nThe intriguing part? These non-brain cells also switched on a \u201cmemory gene\u201d \u2013 the same gene that brain cells activate when they detect information patterns and reorganize their connections to form memories.\n\nSo, how exactly did the scientists gauge the memory and learning process?\n\nThey ingeniously engineered the non-brain cells to generate a glowing protein, which indicated whether the memory gene was active or dormant.\n\nMemory cells, learning, and pulses\n\nThe results of this innovative research were nothing short of astounding.\n\nIt turned out that these cells were able to discern when the chemical pulses (simulating bursts of neurotransmitters in the brain) were repeated rather than simply prolonged \u2014 much like neurons in our own brains when we opt for break-filled studying instead of continuous cramming.\n\nWhen the pulses were delivered at intervals, they activated the \u201cmemory gene\u201d more intensely and for a longer duration than when the same treatment was administered all at once \u2013 a perfect demonstration of the massed-space effect.\n\n\u201cThis reflects the massed-space effect in action,\u201d says Kukushkin, a clinical associate professor of life science at NYU Liberal Studies and a research fellow at NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science.\n\n\u201cIt shows that the ability to learn from spaced repetition isn\u2019t unique to brain cells, but, in fact, might be a fundamental property of all cells.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding how memory works\n\nNot only does this research on non-brain cells introduce fresh perspectives to study memory, but it also holds promise for potential health-related benefits.\n\n\u201cThis discovery opens new doors for understanding how memory works and could lead to better ways to enhance learning and treat memory problems,\u201d notes Kukushkin.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, it suggests that in the future, we will need to treat our body more like the brain \u2014 for example, consider what our pancreas remembers about the pattern of our past meals to maintain healthy levels of blood glucose or consider what a cancer cell remembers about the pattern of chemotherapy.\u201d\n\nImplications of this research\n\nAs we explore this fascinating new research on non-brain cells, the pressing question remains \u2013 how will this impact our understanding of memory formation?\n\nWhat implications does this discovery hold for the future of learning and memory-related treatments? Only time will tell.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nThe research team also included Thomas Carew, a professor in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science; Tasnim Tabassum, an NYU researcher; and Robert Carney, an NYU undergraduate researcher. The study was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (R01-MH120300-01A1).\n\nThe study is published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

        "article_content": "Key takeaways BNB Chain\u2019s NFT trading volume surged 283% in Q3, driven by whales .\n\n. Average daily buyers of NFTs dropped over 50% during this period.\n\nDespite fewer buyers, total NFT sales rose by 47%, according to Messari .\n\n. BNB Chain\u2019s overall trading volume still lags behind Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nBNB Chain Sees NFT Comeback in Q3\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the BNB Chain made a big comeback in the third quarter of 2024. According to a report by Messari, NFT trading volume on the blockchain surged 283% compared to the previous quarter.\n\nThe rise in trading volume came despite a significant drop in average daily buyers, highlighting the influence of whales. The average daily trading volume jumped to $600,400 during Q3.\n\nThis growth was mainly fueled by large investors, commonly known as whales, while smaller buyers left the market.\n\nThe average number of buyers fell over 50%, dropping to just 2,300 daily, according to Messari\u2019s research. However, despite the decline in buyers, the total number of daily sales still increased by 47%, reaching 8,900 transactions per day.\n\nWhale Activity Dominates NFT Trading\n\nOne key factor behind this NFT market revival on BNB Chain was whale participation. Large investors with significant capital began increasing their trades, which helped boost the overall trading volume.\n\nAs Messari pointed out, whales were the main drivers of this growth, even though smaller users exited the market.\n\n\u201cWhales dominated NFT activity in Q3,\u201d the report noted, emphasizing how much influence these large investors had on the chain\u2019s overall performance.\n\nWhile BNB Chain saw strong growth in its NFT market, its total trading volume still lagged behind other major blockchains. Ethereum, for example, recorded $120.7 million in trading volume over the past 30 days, while Bitcoin logged $74.6 million during the same period, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nThis data suggests that while the BNB Chain performed significantly well, it still trails the larger NFT ecosystems like Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nBNB Chain\u2019s Mixed Performance in Q3\n\nDespite the boost in NFT trading, BNB Chain saw mixed results across other key metrics in the third quarter. The blockchain\u2019s revenue dropped 27.9%, mainly due to a decline in gas fees from decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions.\n\nThis fall in revenue came as daily active addresses also decreased by 19%, settling at 900,000. Average daily transactions also fell by 8.1%, further contributing to the decline in revenue.\n\nHowever, there were some positive developments for BNB Chain in Q3. The total value locked (TVL) on the chain increased slightly by 2.2%, reaching $4.8 billion.\n\nThis increase was largely driven by Venus Finance, an algorithmic money market protocol, which saw a 13% rise in its TVL, bringing its total to $1.79 billion.\n\nAnother positive note for BNB Chain was its deflationary token model. During Q3, more BNB tokens were burned than minted, resulting in a 4.5% deflation rate.\n\nThis deflation contributed to a 2.5% price increase for the BNB token during a period when the broader market experienced a slight decline, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nBNB Chain\u2019s Future Outlook\n\nWhile BNB Chain\u2019s performance in Q3 was mixed, it remains a major player in the blockchain space. It boasts the fourth-largest TVL among layer-1 blockchains, trailing only Ethereum, Solana, and Tron, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nIn addition to its growing NFT market, BNB Chain has continued to innovate. The blockchain recently launched a new real-world asset tokenization service. This service allows individuals and businesses to tokenize real-world assets in minutes using a no-code solution.\n\nAccording to Binance, this new feature significantly reduces the cost and time required to tokenize assets, potentially lowering barriers to broader participation.\n\nAdd Techreport to Your Google News Feed Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips.

        "article_content": "Widely-liked open source group OpenUK this week detailed more of its State of Open: The UK In 2024 analysis.\n\nAs the non-profit organisation representing the UK\u2019s open technology sector, OpenUK says that it has looked at the factors in any given industry market that shape the success of open source. It has also concentrated on analysing what enables community development around open source public sector releases and the role of procurement in successful development work.\n\nThe report covers the UK\u2019s current position in the global open source marketplace \u2013 after many years leading the European contribution to open source software in general, that position is now under threat.\n\nWhy so?\n\nBecause governments in France and Germany have expanded their investment and support for open source software development and contributions in recent times.\n\n\u201cThe UK has contributed a huge amount to the technologies and infrastructure that underpin today\u2019s economy. But markets do not stand still \u2013 other countries in Europe have increased their level of investment and incentives, putting the UK\u2019s leadership position in jeopardy in future,\u201d explained Amanda Brock, CEO at OpenUK.\n\nBrock says that in this year\u2019s report, the organisations details the considerations to be dealt with for the new UK government to support open source more effectively generating better returns on investment from any new projects, whether those are public sector organisations using open source or releasing new software as open source for others to use and importantly ensuring its adoption and maintenance.\n\nThis, she says, is particularly vital for public sector AI developments that aim to deliver on digital public good goals.\u201d\n\nGovernance & regulatory understanding Dr. Jennifer Barth, research director at OpenUK and founder of Symmetry thinks that as open source software reshapes industries, it also presents challenges that require careful governance and regulatory understanding. \u201cUnlike proprietary software, open source software operates through open licensing, decentralised contribution and community-driven management, which can create complexity in legal and operational standards,\u201d said Barth. \u201cSuccessful open source software adoption is contingent on comprehending the interplay of governance, technology, and community. For legislators and market participants alike, a nuanced understanding of open source software is essential, as this ecosystem relies on transparency, the protection of intellectual property, and an ethos of equitable use.\u201d"
