Spanish Files offers a unique look into this fascinating chapter of Spanish history.\n\nFor more local news and events in the Almeria province click here."

        "article_content": "It started with a melting glacier that set off a huge landslide, which triggered a 650-foot high mega-tsunami in Greenland last September. Then came something inexplicable: a mysterious vibration that shook the planet for nine days.\n\nOver the past year, dozens of scientists across the world have been trying to figure out what this signal was.\n\nNow they have an answer, according to a new study in the journal Science, and it provides yet another warning that the Arctic is entering \u201cuncharted waters\u201d as humans push global temperatures ever upwards.\n\nSome seismologists thought their instruments were broken when they started picking up vibrations through the ground back in September, said Stephen Hicks, a study co-author and a seismologist at University College London.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the rich orchestra of high pitches and rumbles you might expect with an earthquake, but more of a monotonous hum, he told CNN. Earthquake signals tend to last for minutes; this one lasted for nine days.\n\nHe was baffled, it was \u201ccompletely unprecedented,\u201d he said.\n\nSeismologists traced the signal to eastern Greenland, but couldn\u2019t pin down a specific location. So they contacted colleagues in Denmark, who had received reports of a landslide-triggered tsunami in a remote part of the region called Dickson Fjord.\n\nThe result was a nearly year-long collaboration between 68 scientists across 15 countries, who combed through seismic, satellite and on-the-ground data, as well as simulations of tsunami waves to solve the puzzle.\n\nWhat happened is called a \u201ccascading hazard,\u201d Svennevig said, and it all started with human-caused climate change.\n\nFor years, the glacier at the base of a huge mountain towering nearly 4,000 feet above Dickson Fjord had been melting, as many glaciers are in the rapidly warming Arctic.\n\nAs the glacier thinned, the mountain became increasingly unstable before it eventually collapsed on September 16 last year, sending enough rock and debris tumbling into the water to fill 10,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.\n\nThe subsequent mega-tsunami \u2014 one of the highest in recent history \u2014 set off a wave which became trapped in the bendy, narrow fjord for more than a week, sloshing back and forth every 90 seconds.\n\nThe phenomenon, called a \u201cseiche,\u201d refers to the rhythmic movement of a wave in an enclosed space, similar to water splashing backwards and forwards in a bathtub or cup. One of the scientists even tried (and failed) to recreate the impact in their own bathtub.\n\nWhile seiches are well-known, scientists previously had no idea they could last so long.\n\n\u201cHad I suggested a year ago that a seiche could persist for nine days, people would shake their heads and say that\u2019s impossible,\u201d said Svennevig, who likened the discovery to suddenly finding a new color in a rainbow.\n\nIt was this seiche that created the seismic energy in the Earth\u2019s crust, the scientists found.\n\nIt is maybe the first time scientists have directly observed the impact of climate change \u201con the ground beneath our feet,\u201d said Hicks. And no place was immune; the signal traveled from Greenland to Antarctica in about an hour, he added.\n\nThe mountain in Dickson Fjord, eastern Greenland, in August 12, 2023 before the landslide. (S\u00f8ren Rysgaard via CNN Newsource)\n\nThe mountain after the landslide, on September 19, 2023. (Danish Army via CNN Newsource)\n\nNo one was injured in the tsunami, although it washed away centuries-old cultural heritage sites and damaged an empty military base. But this stretch of water is on a commonly used cruise ship route. If one had been there at the time, \u201cthe consequences would have been devastating,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote.\n\nEastern Greenland had never experienced a landslide and tsunami like this before, Svennevig said. It shows new areas of the Arctic are \u201ccoming online\u201d for these kinds of climate events, he added.\n\nAs the Arctic continues to warm \u2014 over the past few decades, the region has warmed four times faster than the rest of the world \u2014 landslide-triggered mega-tsunamis may become more common and with deadly consequences.\n\nIn June 2017, a tsunami in northwest Greenland killed four people and washed away houses. The threat goes beyond Greenland, Svennevig said; similar-shaped fjords exist in other regions, including Alaska, parts of Canada and Norway.\n\nWhat happened in Greenland last September \u201conce again demonstrates the ongoing destabilization of large mountain slopes in the Arctic due to amplified climate warming,\u201d said Paula Snook, a landslide geologist at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences who was not involved in the study.\n\nRecent rock avalanches in the Arctic as well as in Alpine regions, are \u201can alarming signal,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWe are thawing ground which has been in a cold, frozen state for many thousands of years.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot of research to be done on rock avalanches, which are also affected by natural processes, cautioned Lena Rubensdotter, a researcher at the Geological Survey of Norway, who was also not involved in the study.\n\nHowever, she added, it\u2019s \u201clogical to assume that we will see more frequent rock collapses in permafrost slopes as the climate warms in Arctic regions.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of natural phenomena behaving in seemingly unnatural ways highlights how this part of the world is changing in unexpected ways, Svennevig said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign that climate change is pushing these systems into uncharted waters.\u201d"

        "image_url": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=OVFT.ZwJMMrXo6cwVEoerudy0bS&pid=News&w=234&h=132&c=14&rs=2&qlt=30",

        "date": "5h",
        "source": "The Motley Fool",
        "article_content": "Nvidia's share price has typically declined during the year following a stock split.\n\nFor many investors, Nvidia (NVDA -0.03%) has emerged as the quintessential artificial intelligence (AI) stock. That's because the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center tasks, such as training machine learning models and running AI applications.\n\nNvidia shares have surged 780% since the generative AI application ChatGPT went viral in late 2022. That event triggered a tidal wave of AI infrastructure spending that is still building momentum, and Nvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries. In turn, the stock has become a staple of the AI trade.\n\nNvidia reset its soaring share price in June by conducting a 10-for-1 stock split. Shares have since tumbled about 2%, but history says Nvidia stock may have further to fall.\n\nStock-split stocks like Nvidia typically outperform the S&P 500\n\nGenerally speaking, companies conduct forward stock splits after substantial share price appreciation, which itself is suggestive of compelling growth prospects and a competitive edge. Companies that possess those qualities tend to produce above-average returns for shareholders.\n\nIndeed, Bank of America reviewed data back to 1980 and found a correlation. Companies that split their stock returned an average of 25.4% during the 12 months after announcing the split. By comparison, the S&P 500 returned an average of 11.9% during the same period.\n\nHere's what that could mean: Nvidia announced its latest stock split after the market closed on May 22, 2024. The stock traded at a split-adjusted $95 per share. History says its share price will increase 25.4% to $119 by May 2025. But the stock already trades at $119 per share, leaving zero implied upside (or downside) over the next eight months.\n\nNvidia has performed poorly following past stock splits\n\nWe can also make predictions about Nvidia's future performance by reviewing company-specific data. For instance, the chipmaker completed five stock splits prior to the most recent one. The chart below shows how the stock performed during the 12 months and 24 months following those five splits.\n\nStock Split Date 12-Month Return 24-Month Return June 2000 28% (52%) September 2001 (72%) (49%) April 2006 1% (6%) September 2007 (70%) (53%) July 2021 (4%) 145% Average (23%) (3%)\n\nAs shown above, Nvidia has usually performed poorly following stock splits. Its share price has declined by an average of 23% during the first 12 months and was still down by 3% on average after 24 months.\n\nHere's what that could mean: Nvidia completed its 10-for-1 split after the market closed on June 7. The stock traded at a split-adjusted $121 per share. History says its share price will drop 23% to $93 by June 2025. The stock currently trades at $119 per share, so the implied downside is 22% over the next nine months.\n\nHaving said that, past performance is never a guarantee of future results. Moreover, most of the stock splits listed in the chart took place within 12 months of a recession, so Nvidia had little chance of posting positive returns. Going forward, whether Nvidia is a good investment depends on its financial performance and what investors are willing to pay to own shares of the company.\n\nNvidia is the market leader in artificial intelligence chips\n\nNvidia dominates the market for data center GPUs, chips used to speed up workloads like AI applications. The company accounted for 98% of data center GPU shipments in 2023, essentially unchanged from the prior year, and those GPUs account for more than 80% of AI chips.\n\nThere are two reasons for that dominance. First, Nvidia designs the most powerful GPUs money can buy, and rapid product development keeps its GPUs on the cutting edge in terms of performance. Second, Nvidia complements its chips with a robust ecosystem of software libraries and developer tools called CUDA. The CUDA platform streamlines the building of GPU-accelerated applications.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, graphics processor sales are projected to grow at 27% annually through 2030, driven by the proliferation of machine learning and AI. Nvidia's sales should increase at a similar pace, plus or minus a few percentage points. However, earnings may grow a bit faster due to share repurchases and potential margin expansion driven by pricing power.\n\nWall Street forecasts adjusted earnings will increase at 35% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). That consensus makes the current valuation of 54 times earnings look tolerable. Investors should consider buying a small position in Nvidia stock today, provided they are comfortable with volatility and willing to hold their shares for at least three to five years."

This Witchy Needs is owned by Jade Hawkins, 35, who\u2019s moved her business from Longton Market to The Longton Exchange and says there is much more custom there.\n\nThis Witchy Needs also offers reiki and holistic therapies, which are said to engage mindfulness practices, and consider a person's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being with the aim of understanding themselves better. The Sneyd Green mum decided to move her business as she needed more space to carry out her services, as well as requiring space to stock items for the shop.\n\nSome of the items on sale include mugs, incense, crystals, clothing, and other \u201cwitchy and paranormal\u201d related goods. Jade is also well known throughout the Six Towns for the ghost hunts she hosts, which she has done for more than 30 years.\n\nJade said: \u201cI started off in Longton Market at the end of May but I needed more space. I needed to expand because we have so many ranges of items and services on offer, and this was the last lease available in The Longton Exchange. It\u2019s a lot better here and it\u2019s busier than the market. I'd say footfall in the area is probably about 80 percent more than in the market.\n\n\u201cI did ghost hunts anyway in and around Stoke, and I have done for 30 odd years in total, so I decided to open a shop so people can come and talk to me when they want to. We offer tarot readings, reiki, and lots of holistic therapies. People can come in and enquire, and they can pre-book set days or they can do walk-ins if they\u2019re available. We usually get walk-ins and we\u2019ve been busy.\u201d\n\nTalking about her life prior to opening This Witchy Needs, Jade said: \u201cI did work full time as a care supervisor, but I decided to go self employed. It\u2019s the best thing I ever did because it\u2019s more flexible, and being open six days a week is much better than only opening for three days a week when I was in the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always got incense burning and meditation music playing in the shop. It\u2019s a safe space for people to come in and have a coffee and a chat. We\u2019re always bringing in different things when we place our orders.\n\n\"If there\u2019s anything specific people want and we don\u2019t stock it in store then we can order it online and get it from them. We welcome everyone and we want people to pop in and ask us any questions they have about anything spiritual or paranormal.\u201d\n\nThis Witchy Needs is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 9am until 5pm, on Wednesdays from 10am until 5pm, and on Saturdays from 9.30am until 5.30pm. People can find out more by visiting This Witchy Needs on Facebook and TikTok, and a website is currently being built which will be found at thiswitchyneeds.com."

Similar wasp species are known to target flies during their younger, more vulnerable larva and pupa life stages.\n\nThe study, led by Logan Moore during his doctoral studies at Mississippi State University, was published in the journal Nature on September 11. The team of scientists discovered the wasp species by chance while they were collecting fruit flies in their backyards.\n\nIn an interview with Live Science, Moore explained that female S. perlmani use their needle-like ovipositor organ \u2014 the stinger in stinging wasps \u2014 to stab and deposit an egg within a fruit fly's abdomen. The egg then hatches into a tiny wasp larva, which grows inside the fly for about 18 days before leaving its host for dead.\n\n\"It will effectively emerge out of the side of the fly, and just to add an additional layer of horror, the fly will normally remain alive for several hours after that,\" Morre said, explaining the chilling process."

        "article_content": "Did you ever dream you had X-ray vision when you were a kid? While that might sound like something from comic books, new research published in Science this week could bring us one step closer to making it a reality.\n\nScientists have found a way to see inside the bodies of living animals without surgery by using a surprising tool: a food dye that is common in America. This breakthrough discovery revealed that the dye, known as tartrazine, can make skin, muscles, and connective tissues temporarily see-through!\n\nTartrazine is a yellow food dye commonly found in products like Doritos and other snacks in the U.S. The dye doesn\u2019t just colour food; it has an unexpected ability to change how light moves through tissues. Normally, light entering biological tissue scatters because of the different structures inside the body, like fatty membranes and cell nuclei. These structures have a different refractive index from the air around them, which is why light doesn\u2019t travel smoothly through our skin and other tissues.\n\nThis scattering effect is what keeps us from seeing through our skin - or anyone else's. However, in this study, tartrazine was found to reduce the amount of light scattering inside tissue, allowing light to penetrate more deeply. The result? Scientists could see through the skin of living animals.\n\nIn a fascinating experiment using mice, researchers applied tartrazine to the animals' skin. When rubbed onto the belly, the dye allowed scientists to clearly see the liver, intestines, and bladder beneath the skin. When applied to the scalp, they could even observe blood vessels in the brain!\n\nEven more amazing, the skin returned to its normal colour after the dye was washed off, meaning the effect wasn\u2019t permanent.\n\nTo understand how this works, think about what happens when you place a pencil in a glass of water. The pencil appears bent or distorted because light behaves differently when it passes through water compared to air. This is due to something called the refractive index, which measures how much light bends when it passes through different materials. The same principle applies when light passes through biological tissues like skin.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, biological tissues scatter light, making it impossible to see through them. The dye used in this study helps certain wavelengths of light pass through tissues more easily, reducing that scattering effect.\n\nWhile this discovery is ground-breaking, it\u2019s not perfect. The effect is limited by how deeply the dye can penetrate into tissues. For now, the transparency only works on surface-level tissues. However, the scientists are already developing techniques like micro-needling and injections to allow the dye to reach deeper layers of skin and tissue.\n\nAlthough this study was conducted on mice, the potential applications for humans are enormous. Imagine doctors being able to visualize organs, blood vessels, and deep tissues without invasive surgery. This technology could revolutionise fields like diagnostics, allowing for real-time monitoring of the body\u2019s internal structures with minimal risk to the patient.\n\nThe future possibilities are exciting. With further research, this dye technique could become a powerful tool for non-invasive medical imaging, bringing us closer to a world where X-ray vision isn\u2019t just a superpower - it\u2019s science.\n\nLISTEN ABOVE"

Users can manage and control their finances, make payments & transfers if they need be and access traditional banking services on their cellphones via these applications.\n\nLately we\u2019re seeing all our favorite payment apps such as Venmo, PayPal and Cash App explode in popularity. Similarly, traditional banks have also gone mobile with apps like Chase Mobile or Bank of America Mobile Banking.\n\nDigital Wallets\n\nDigital wallets are one more sort of fintech that has in a lot of ways changed the economic landscape. They are secure wallets that store payment details and allow you to pay for stuff without cash or using your pocket card with a simple tap.\n\nOther than the fact they work, Apple Pay and Google Wallet are pretty pedestrian \u2013 just another digital wallet to use side-by-side with traditional payment methods.\n\n1) AI and ML\n\nIn financial app development, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are acting as a spine. Initiatives are using these technologies to improve everything from customer service in financial services and insurtech, through to risk management.\n\nCustomer-Centric Engagement. Financial institutions can now capitalize on AI and ML to provide customers with bespoke experiences, by utilizing an abundance of data reservoirs that the solution solutions analyze, in order to understand individual liking or dislike patterns. This customization makes for happier and returning customers.\n\nArtificial Intelligence-Powered Chatbots for Instant Customer Support and Product Recommendations Credit unions, along with traditional banks and fintech companies deploy chatbots powered by AI to provide instant customer support and query responses; leverage data analytics capabilities using the user\u2019s financial history or behavioral analysis laying down personalized product recommendations.\n\nFraud Detection and Risk Management. Vendors are employing AI and ML for better fraud prevention and risk management as well. Real-time transaction pattern analysis- These technologies monitor transactions as they occur and detect any anomalies indicative of fraudulent activities.\n\nBy using machine learning algorithms, credit card companies better recognize unusual purchasing behavior and high probability fraud which could help to prevent unwanted transactions protecting the general public.\n\n2) Blockchain and Cryptocurrency\n\nIn financial software development, both blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have paved the way for new trends. This will bring novel options in transaction execution, value storage and financial operation security/ transparency.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) is a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges or banks. DeFi platforms allow for users to lend, borrow, trade and invest in a decentralized fashion.\n\nAs a result, platforms like Uniswap, Compound and Aave have gained popularity allowing users to perform financial activities without need for traditional middlemen. Using smart contracts for securing and executing transactions across various platforms.\n\nCryptocurrencies and Digital Assets\n\nCryptocurrencies and digital assets are going more mainstream every year as they get increasingly adopted by financial institutions (now including PayPal), consumers, and even institutional investors. More recently, fintech development concentrates on building products with cryptocurrency support and secure storage to help things like crypto transactions.\n\nThere are many excellent places where you can buy and sell bitcoin, but Coinbase or Binance offer a fast way to get started compared to other options. Families of traditional financial institutions are also checking out the water in a splash, matured enough over blockchain technology space to innovate their workflow and onboard new products.\n\n3) Cloud computing\n\nCloud computing and API integration are the key trends driving modern software for financial services. They help financial institutions to streamline their operations, as well as secure and provide services with the latest technologies.\n\nFinancial companies can greatly benefit from cloud computing, since with the help of easily deployable and scalable hybrid, public or private cloud applications their business will be more competitive. Cloud-based solutions also mean easy to update and maintain, so that financial software solutions always remain secure and current.\n\nOne trend that we are witnessing is banks & financial institutions moving their core banking systems to the cloud and accessing services such as AWS, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure for bolstering IT infrastructure of these enterprises.\n\n4) API Integration\n\nAn API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of accessible requests that all software systems can use to communicate and work together. Among other use cases in financial services, APIs facilitate the integration of different applications and enable access to external third-party solutions or features.\n\nThe API for open banking allows third party developers to create applications and services around the financial institution. This enables innovation and greater consumer choice, leading to more competition in financial products.\n\nConclusion\n\nFinancial software development landscape emerging rapidly, the financial development environment is being elastically conformed over several innovations in fintech, advancements of AI and ML technology blocks like blockchain tech notably also driving adoption side-by-side with cloud technologies empowering these API-first approaches. Technologies needed to realize these trends are changing the dynamics of financial services making room for new businesses and experiences. After all, financial institutions that side with these trends will be able to compete effectively and keep pace with evolving consumer expectations in the new digital era. With the industry continuously changing, businesses that stay agile with these trends will perform better on this fast-paced financial landscape."

        "article_content": "Last week, I was in Berlin with the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold at the very start of my review period, and I wanted to write something about the camera ahead of it. I decided to do so by indulging in a photographic hobby of mine.\n\nWhen I travel, I like to take photos of cars, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was going to be my companion. It had better be up to the task, as other phones were waiting in the wings if it let me down.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nCar-spotting in Berlin\n\nDespite the Pixel 9 Pro Fold having Pro in its name, it does not have the same camera as the Pixel 9 Pro or even the Pixel 9. It has a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5MP wide-angle camera, and a 10.8MP telephoto camera for a 5x optical zoom. It\u2019s essentially the same as the Google Pixel Fold\u2019s camera setup, and on a technical level, it\u2019s not as impressive as the far less expensive (but much less foldy) Pixel 9 Pro or even the Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nBut would it do what I wanted while in Berlin? I was in the city for the IFA 2024 technology trade show, and I stayed in close proximity to Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (or Ku\u2019damm for short), which is central, elegant, and packed with lovely places for coffee and food. It\u2019s also full of expensive designer stores, luxury watch brand boutiques, and all the cars accompanying those who shop there. Over the many years I\u2019ve stayed in this area, I\u2019ve always enjoyed some casual car-spotting, often to the chagrin of my colleagues.\n\nI\u2019m a car geek, so when I\u2019m in new places, I find it really enjoyable to spot cars I don\u2019t usually see at home. What makes Kurf\u00fcrstendamm enjoyable for me is the variety of cars you see cruising and parked up, ranging from supercars to modern classics in fantastic condition.\n\nA good car-spotting camera needs to take colorful, high-contrast, dynamic photos in all lighting conditions to highlight the metal. It really needs a telephoto camera, so you don\u2019t have to get right up close to the vehicle when taking a photo, keeping things more incognito. It also needs a robust editing suite and a big screen to make adjustments. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold should be a great choice, so how did it do?\n\nUsing the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera\n\nOver the few days I was in Berlin, I took around 50 photos of different cars with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold \u2014 and I loved the results, regardless of whether I used the main, wide, 5x telephoto camera, or even the 2x non-optical zoom. I was consistently impressed with the speed of the camera, too, and although I didn\u2019t take many photos of cars on the move (more on that in a moment), I never missed a shot due to the camera or app being too slow.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I take photos of cars on the move? I had intended to try out Google\u2019s Action Pan mode, which adds a cool motion blur effect to moving objects, as I\u2019d enjoyed it on the Pixel 9 and Pixel 8. However, oddly, Action Pan is missing from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera app. Action Pan\u2019s sister mode, Long Exposure, is present though. There\u2019s no obvious technical reason why it\u2019s not included, and in this case, it was rather frustrating. Perhaps it\u2019ll turn up in a future software update.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 4 Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster. 5x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes Maybach S680. 5x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-AMG GT. Main camera Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz AMG G63. Wide-angle Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nWhat about the cars? It\u2019ll come as no surprise that two leading car brands dominate the Ku\u2019damm landscape: Mercedes Benz and Porsche. Porsches of all types are so prevalent that I stopped taking photos of 911s, as I\u2019d have spent most of my time capturing them if I hadn\u2019t done so.\n\nI didn\u2019t do the same with Mercedes as, despite seeing so many, the models were often highly unusual spots for me, as Ku\u2019dammers seem to love their high-performance Mercs. That said, on one day, the first five cars I considered photographing were all AMG GT models of various types, giving you an idea of how prevalent this particular car was in the area.\n\nThe cars and photos\n\nI didn\u2019t want to fixate on just supercars either, and I wanted to illustrate the variety of cars I saw, which I think speaks to the interesting car culture that I assume exists in Berlin and its surroundings. The convertible Mustang was a surprise, and although I didn\u2019t get photos as most were on the move when I saw them, the amount of Aston Martin and Jaguars, both new and old, illustrated that it wasn\u2019t solely about German cars either. Ferrari was notable in its absence, and the few I did see were easily outnumbered by Lamborghini and Bentley models. It was fantastic to see all these cars out and in use, particularly during the week.\n\nThe beautiful weather during my stay no doubt helped people bring out cars that may have otherwise been safely garaged, and it also helped out with my photos, as did the urban backdrop. I tried to incorporate Ku\u2019damm and its side streets into the photos, but there were times when a bit too much of it got in the way, and this is where the Pixel 9 Pro Fold became the ultimate companion for my car-spotting adventures on the move. For a start, opening the phone to view and then edit images on the large screen is amazing, and it simply can\u2019t be matched on a non-folding phone. Only editing on a laptop or tablet can compare, and I can carry neither in my pocket.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 6 1967 Ford Mustang Convertible.

Main camera Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz S Class. 2x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nOn the open screen I was able to make full use of Google Photos\u2019 Magic Editor mode, and wow, did it do some impressive things. My favorite is the wide-angle photo of the Mustang, which was interrupted by a street sign and some of the rental scooters that litter Berlin\u2019s streets when I took it.\n\nAmazingly, after a few careful swipes, Magic Editor took them all away without a trace. If I didn\u2019t point it out and show you the before image, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever realize. It also turned a photo I\u2019d have probably discarded into one I really like. I did the same with the background in the photo of the beautiful R129 SL, then removed the parked cars on either side of the white S Class, and was astonished by the clean, seamless result.\n\nNot a car-spotter?\n\nThis isn\u2019t our review of the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold or its camera, so all the photos you see here have been edited on the device using the tools found in Google Photos. Magic Editor has become incredibly adept at removing small distractions and re-creating backgrounds perfectly, and cleaning up the photos took just a few moments.\n\nBut I only wanted to edit the photos because they looked excellent to begin with, meaning I could tweak them to my taste rather than use the tools to try to reach an acceptable baseline. I\u2019ve managed to create a collection of photos I am really happy with that captures Berlin\u2019s obvious love of very powerful cars.\n\nWhen I came up with the idea of using car-spotting as the basis for my story on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold while in Berlin, it was with some trepidation. I take these photos for myself and fun, so I didn\u2019t want that to change. If the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was a pain or didn\u2019t take the pictures I wanted, it would become an effort and effectively become work, with all the fun of car photography removed.\n\nThis didn\u2019t happen because the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a joy to hold and use. It\u2019s not annoyingly heavy, the software has been faultless, and I never wanted to reach for the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max I also had with me to take a photo. I enjoyed my occasional hobby of photographing cool cars I spot just as much, if not more than usual, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold as my camera and Magic Editor at the ready.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never taken a photo of a car and are wondering if all this is relevant to you, all the same principles and performance of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera and Google Photos apply to whatever you\u2019re photographing. I love the open screen when I want to see my photos after taking them, and the telephoto camera allows me to shoot my chosen subject in more visually exciting ways from a distance. The editing toolkit helped me easily create photos I wish had been possible in real life.\n\nRegardless of what you want to take photos of, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a great companion. My first few days with the phone and its camera have left me smitten, and it\u2019s looking like the start of a very positive review."
