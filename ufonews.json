            "article_content": "Dallas County, April 1897\n\n\n\nNewspapers of the day reported the sightings straight-faced, although one can read more than a little tongue-in-cheek writing into some of the dispatches from community correspondents.\n\n\n\nDescriptions of the airships varied somewhat, but there was a general consensus that they had cigar-shaped bodies or cabins 50 to 60 feet long with propellers at each end, large bat-like wings, and huge floodlights fore and aft. Most witnesses saw neither pilot nor crew, but in some cases, not only did observers see people manning the ships, but talked to them. The Dallas Morning News' correspondent at Waxahachie reported a long conversation between Judge Love of the community and an airship crew, which claimed to be from the North Pole.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Field, 1952\n\n\n\nThere was considerable air traffic in the vicinity (normal Love Field activity) and there was enough light that aircraft were identifiable as the general type when viewed in the southwest, the sun to the rear. I first noticed an orange colored light which appeared to be nothing more than the exhaust or running light of an aircraft. Then, I noticed the light gave off an exhaust trail similar to that of an afterburner. I watched the light in its descending path for about four seconds when it seemed to fire a number of \"rockets\" and vanished.\n\n\n\nUniversity Park, 1961\n\n\n\nAt exactly 4:07 AM CST early Thursday morning, March 9th, I was out in my back yard doing a bit of amateur satelloon watching [a balloon satellite] ....hoping to see the polka-dot 12 footer, and I SAW A BIG, extremely fast, unidentified object streaking from about ENE to SW across the sky. It moved so fast was hard to focus on it, but I DO remember quite a bit of the impression it left on me. This object, seemingly, moved so darn fast that I would never have given it much later thought, except that the 7:00 AM news that morning carried big story that the Russians had orbited a dog, etc. in a 5-ton rocket.\n\nDenton, 2007\n\n\n\nI think I saw a UFO. I am not really sure. I feel like I am kind of crazy for thinking this. I was driving on 35W in Denton, TX around 10:15 a.m. 11/21/07 this morning and when I came over a hill I saw three white things in the sky. It was like 1 mile in front of me, slightly to the right. I wasn't sure if it was the balls that are on powerline to warn airplanes and then I thought it was a reflection the stadium. the balls were white with some silver tint. They were almost a perfect circle, but a little oblong.\n\n\n\nThey were perfectly aligned in a row a little to the left of me looking straight ahead. I was thinking I should take a picture because I thought oh it might be a UFO. I was trying to figure out what it was and the one on the right disapeared and one second later the middle one dissapeared and a little less then one second later the left one dissapeared. It didn't fade out or dart away. It just dissapeared in a split second.\n\n\n\nI am super freaked out right now and I don't know if It was something from Carswell air base or Lockead Martin, but I have NEVER seen anything like this before. It was soooo clear too. Not fuzy at all! PLease let me know if anyone else has seen this one in Denton! I have been very skeptical of UFO sightings, but I am so freaked out and paranoid now!\n\n\n\nIrving, 2021\n\n\n\nThe shiny spinning disc was seen hovering over a golf course before it appeared to have landed on the ground in Irving on April 25.\n\n\n\nFootage was recorded by a man who was visiting the area with his friends. They then saw the strange object reflecting the sunlight from a distance.\n\n\n\nA man was heard saying in the background: \u2018You see that? That\u2019s not a weather balloon, dude, it\u2019s flat.\n\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s moving really weird, it\u2019s like spinning and it\u2019s got another disc inside of it that\u2019s spinning.\u2019\n\n\n\nHe described the object as a \u2018large metallic ring that floated around a separate metallic sphere within the ring, like a flying armillary sphere.\u2019\n\nPilots flying near Dallas Fort Worth International Airport recently reported some suspicious lights floating around that air traffic controllers couldn't spot with their technology. It provoked quite the conversation.Seems UFO sightings is a topic that may never go out of style, especially in North Texas. In fact, a recent study names Texas as one of the top hotspots for UFO sightings in the U.S. Some of the more talked-about UFO sightings in the nation\u2019s history have occurred in other parts of Texas like Levelland, Lubbock and Dayton, for example.It got us to thinking about North Texas\u2019 history with UFO sightings. In case you aren\u2019t aware, it\u2019s neithera rare nor recent phenomenon. This is by no means a comprehensive compendium of North Texas UFO sightings, but here are some of the accounts that stuck out the most to us.UFO sightings in North Texas were all the rage back when ol\u2019 Charles Culberson served as the state\u2019s 21st governor, just 30-plus years removed from the Civil War. According to the Texas Almanac , \u201cbetween April 13 and 17, 1897, there were 38 reported sightings of \u2018airships\u2019 in 23 counties in Texas, including in Denton and Dallas Counties.\"In 2015, the published an article looking at the Dallas UFO sightings mentioned in Project Blue Book, a federal program that subjected reports of UFO sightings to certain scientific analysis. This sighting noted in Project Blue Book caught our eye.Another local example logged in Project Blue Book was intriguing to us. One man who reported a UFO sighting was indeed looking to the sky for something unique, but not for what he says he found.Did you know there\u2019s a National UFO Reporting Center? The center has a website where folks can log their sightings. This account from Denton, reprinted as it appeared, caught our attention, as we could relate to feeling more than a little perplexed at what we think we may have just seen.Look, not all UFO sightings are created equal. Not all accounts are going to get the public all riled up. But here\u2019s one from Irving from only three years ago , and it includes the term \u201c armillary sphere ,\u201d for which we give props. It's a wonderfully on-point description of what we think an alien spacecraft may look like. Plus, there\u2019s a video of it, posted to a website called Newsflare."

Slay the Princess \u2013 The Pristine Cut\n\n5 Slay the Princess blends romance with horror Credit: Black Tabby Games\n\nSlay the Princess was first released last year, but The Pristine Cut adds more routes, expanded dialogue, and extra endings.\n\nEvery decision reflects back at you in this romantic horror game where you try to slay and save each other over and over.\n\nWith more choices than any other game I\u2019ve played, it raises the bar for the genre.\n\nIf you want to know more about the game, check out our Slay the Princess review.\n\n4. UFO 50\n\n5 UFO 50 has so many games you have to love at least one of them Credit: Mossmouth\n\nUFO 50 is a collection of more than 50 retro-inspired games that span the gamut of genres.\n\nIt has everything from puzzle games to deck builders, RPGs, 2D platformers, and metroidvanias.\n\nThere\u2019s also an overarching meta-narrative that connects all of the games together, and secrets within each game to discover.\n\nIt was even nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards if you need more proof.\n\n3. Tactical Breach Wizards\n\n5 Tactical Breach Wizards blends strategy and puzzle solving Credit: Suspicious Developments\n\nIf you like XCOM but wish it had more puzzle-solving, then Tactical Breach Wizards is for you.\n\nIt has the squad-based tactics gameplay of XCOM but changes it so you are solving puzzles in the heat of the moment and on the fly.\n\nEach teammate's abilities are unique and yet they can synergise in some way with every other character in the game.\n\nIt\u2019s all topped off by hilarious writing, to make a funny and satisfying experience.\n\n2. Balatro\n\n5 Balatro mixes Poker hands with a high score multiplyer deck building Credit: Apple / Balatro\n\nIt\u2019s rare that an indie game gets nominated for Game of the Year, let alone one developed by just one person.\n\nBalatro is a Poker-inspired deck builder, where you use different Jokers to multiply the score of each hand you play.\n\nWith various difficulties, decks, Jokers, and other cards to collect, you\u2019ll keep picking Balatro up for just one more run.\n\nIf you want to read more about it, check out our Balatro review.\n\n1. Indika\n\n5 Indika is the most unique game we played this year Credit: Odd Meter\n\nThere are very few games that ask you to play as a Russian nun during the 19th century, in fact, Indika is the only one we\u2019ve played.\n\nIt makes for a beautifully surreal story of self-discovery and genre-blending where third-person action gives way to pixel-art 2D platforming.\n\nIndika has a unique perspective in direction, cinematography, and storytelling, making it nothing else we\u2019ve played quite like it.\n\nIt was everything unique and special about Indika that has left it as our favourite indie game of 2024."

            "article_content": "One of the most significant emerging trends of 2024 has been the interplay between artificial intelligence (AI) and the crypto ecosystem. Historically this has primarily been on the infrastructure side, affecting various layers of the stack such as decentralized compute, storage and model training and inference. However, the last few months the crypto x AI crossover has taken stage front and center as agents have surfaced and are multiplying by the thousands. While the AI agent narrative has taken up a lot of mindshare of late, we've barely scratched the surface of what we're going to see in 2025.\n\nWhat are AI agents?\n\nAI agents are autonomous programs designed to perform specific tasks. This could be as simple as sharing memes on X, all the way to complex on-chain transactions optimizing trade execution or yield farming strategies. Unlike standard bots, AI agents can learn best practices over time and make undefined decisions to meet predefined goals. Think of them as highly skilled, evolving crypto participants capable of navigating the digital economy autonomously.\n\nThe value of AI agents lies not just in their utility but in their potential to scale human capabilities. Agents are no longer just tools \u2014 they are emerging as participants in the on-chain economy, driving innovation across finance, gaming and decentralized social platforms. With protocols such as Virtuals and open-source frameworks like ELIZA, it\u2019s becoming increasingly simple for developers to build, deploy and iterate AI agents that serve an increasingly diverse set of use cases.\n\nEmerging applications of AI agents\n\nThis year offered glimpses of the potential applications for AI agents. From the bizarre rise of the Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) memecoin to the rapid growth of agent-led experiments, AI agents are beginning to reshape how we interact with technology, culture and finance. Terminal of Truths (ToT) , an AI agent trained on a satirical internet religion, received a grant from prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreesen and amassed over 200,000 followers becoming crypto\u2019s first AI KOL (key opinion leader) and millionaire as it drove $GOAT to a market cap of more than $1 billion.\n\nWhile ToT might feel like an anomaly, it serves as a proof of concept for how AI agents can drive community-building, capture attention and fuel the next generation of on-chain activity. Since then over 11,000 agents have launched on the leading platform Virtuals, which may seem like a lot yet pales in comparison to pump.fun which is averaging 4x that every single day. While most of the agents launched are simple bots that simply propagate memes, we\u2019re also seeing agents such as aixbt, which provides sophisticated investment research, and zerebro, which creates unique digital art. These applications may appear niche, but they offer a glimpse into the growing design space for AI agent innovation.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Earlier this month, researchers announced they found the smallest asteroids ever detected within the main belt, which is a field between Mars and Jupiter where millions of asteroids orbit. With this discovery, scientists say they can now identify and track asteroids that are likely to approach Earth more accurately and efficiently.\n\nEvery few years, an asteroid roughly the size of a bus \u2014 or a Boston Duck Tour boat \u2014 can strike Earth and send shockwaves through entire regions, researchers say. Now, a key advancement in planetary defense has been made by astronomers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other researchers, authorities said.\n\nOn the morning of June 30, 1908, an asteroid plunged into Earth\u2019s atmosphere and exploded over Siberia, Russia, creating a blast zone nearly three times the size of Chicago. In 2013, an asteroid unleashed a loud sonic boom and shockwave over Chelyabinsk, Russia that injured hundreds and damaged thousands of buildings.\n\n\u201cWe now have a way of spotting these small asteroids when they are much farther away, so we can do more precise orbital tracking, which is key for planetary defense,\u201d Artem Burdanov, the study\u2019s lead-author and research scientist at MIT, said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearchers have now located more than 100 new \u201cdecameter\u201d asteroids, asteroids tens of meters in size, in the main asteroid belt, according to a paper published in Nature. These \u201cdecameter\u201d asteroids are more likely to escape the main asteroid belt and plunge into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nRichard Binzel, research co-author and MIT professor of planetary science, said astronomers usually alert the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge of any detected objects approaching Earth.\n\n\u201cOnce those observations are at [the center], everyone can see those observations... and try to identify if the object will collide with Earth and where it will happen,\u201d Binzel said in an interview last week.\n\nA comparison of how many asteroids can now be detected with the team\u2019s detection method. Ella Maru/Julien de Wit\n\nUntil now, the smallest asteroids astronomers have been able to detect are around one kilometer, which is 1000 meters, researchers said. With this breakthrough, astronomers can now spot asteroids as small as 10 meters.\n\n\u201cThis is a totally new, unexplored space we are entering, thanks to modern technologies,\u201d Burdanov said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study\u2019s lead astronomers used data from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and \u201crecycled\u201d an image processing technique originally used to search for exoplanets to search for asteroids, researchers said.\n\n\u201cJWST has been observing the sky with extreme precision to do exoplanetary science, which is what we usually do, but it just so happens that we can use its unparalleled data to find the smallest asteroid in the main belt ever,\u201d Julien de Wit, research co-author and MIT professor of planetary science, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nDe Wit referenced the asteroid that exploded over Chelyabinsk in 2013, stating that it had only been spotted a mere 12 hours before it collided with Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This is the asteroid that prompted NASA to form a Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) in 2016.\n\nNow, with the researchers\u2019 discoveries, astronomers can detect decameter asteroids much further in advance.\n\n\u201cWith new technology, we can find populations of asteroids that were inaccessible previously,\u201d De Wit said. \u201c...Now we have the capability to be able to study this object further out, predict the orbit with much better accuracy, and decide what to do for potential or possible future impactors.\u201d\n\nSabrina Lam can be reached at sabrina.lam@globe.com."

That\u2019s thanks to specific cancer markers\u2014cells that often appear when invasive cancer cells are present in the body. But a new study could throw all that out.\n\nAneuploid cells are a common clue doctors look for when checking for invasive breast cancer. These cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes, and many believe that imbalance is what helps the cancer spread and evade the body\u2019s immune system.\n\nHowever, a new study from researchers at the University of Texas and the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas has found that these cancer markers might also be present even when cancer isn\u2019t.\n\nImage source: utah51 / Adobe\n\nThe researchers published their findings in the journal Nature, writing that they had discovered aneuploid cells in the breast tissue samples of 49 healthy women. This discovery is concerning for a number of reasons\u2014the most important is that it changes what we thought we understood about this invasive cancer.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nIf these cells are not actually cancer markers, and they appear in healthy tissue, too, then doctors will need to find another way to spot breast cancer during the early stages. Overall, this discovery has some huge implications for the field of breast cancer, as well as for multiple other cancer types.\n\nThe researchers were quick to note that these findings don\u2019t mean that everyone is walking around with precancers. However, they do warn that we need to set up larger studies to help us understand the implications of developing cancer so that we can better determine when and how cancer gets started in different individuals.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that this particular approach could reveal these cancer markers in other parts of the body, too. All of this could, hopefully, lead to more insight into creating new cancer treatment options."

            "article_content": "ABI Research's 5th annual Trend Report identifies the key Digital Payment Technologies trend that will come to fruition \u2014and the 1 that won't\u2014in 2025\n\nNEW YORK, Dec. 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- As 2025 kicks off, predictions abound on the technology innovations expected in the year ahead. In its new whitepaper, 101 Technology Trends That Will\u2014and Won't\u2014Shape 2025, analysts from global technology intelligence firm ABI Research. ABI Research analysts identify 54 trends that will shape the technology market and 47 others that, although attracting vast amounts of speculation and commentary, are less likely to move the needle over the next twelve months. In the Digital Payment Technologies space, 2025 will see increased QR code payment acceptance but little growth for payment card IC ASPs.\n\n2024 Logo\n\n\"2024 has been marked by challenges, from global conflicts and inflationary pressures to political uncertainty. These factors have strained enterprise and consumer spending, leading to market inertia, short-term technology investments, sidelined capital, and the exposure of vulnerable suppliers,\" says Stuart Carlaw, Chief Research Officer at ABI Research. \"From a technology perspective, many industries and end markets are in that awkward stage of technology adoption where they are formulating implementation strategies, assessing solutions and partners, and trying to see if they have the resources needed to roll out solutions at scale. This is a particularly sensitive time, which tends to suggest 2025 will have tech implementers and end users on the brink of a period of a massive technology shift as they work through these issues.\"\n\nWhat Will Happen in 2025:\n\nQR code payment acceptance will continue to increase with use cases expanding\n\nAlthough QR code payment acceptance is prevalent in countries such as China and growing in emerging digital payment markets, including in India, use cases and potential growth areas are not limited to these countries. Significant and continued investments by vendors, including PayPal, Stripe, and SumUp, are setting the foundation for increased adoption in other mature and established economies with use cases expanding. Although QR codes are already being used by many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and pop-up retail businesses, 2025 will mark the year when the technology begins to shift from one niche to partial mainstream.\n\nWhat Won't Happen in 2025:\n\nPayment card IC ASPs will not return to pre-COVID-19 levels\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, chipset pricing has been on a continual rise, driven by increased pricing in myriad manufacturing areas, including energy, raw material, transit pricing, and inflation, driving up wages. The chip shortage further compounded this, and according to ABI Research, the Average Selling Price (ASP) for a payment card Integrated Circuit (IC) increased by approximately +30% between 2020 and 2023. However, despite pricing pressures returning, the cost of payment ICs is some years away from matching pre-COVID-19 levels. Although 2025 will mark another year of pricing deprecation, it will not be until around 2028 when pricing is expected to drop to levels similar to those achieved in 2019 steadily.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Nestle Vietnam has set its sights to capitalise on rising demand for convenient beverage options in the country to drive the growth of its Nescafe a ready-to-serve liquid concentrate.\n\nAccording to the firm, Nescafe stepped up its format and product innovation to keep up with the latest trends and consumer demands.\n\n\u201cVietnam, in particular, is a country with a very rich coffee culture, and there have also been some novel popular trends emerging over the past few years,\u201d Nestle Vietnam Business Executive Officer Mostafa Youssef told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\n\u201cCold coffee tends to be more popular here, and interestingly there has also been a movement towards liquid coffees \u2013 which is why we have recently launched a new innovation in the form of a coffee concentrate in a stick.\n\n\u201cThe convenience factor is strong with these as all consumers need to do is open up the coffee stick, pour over ice \u2013 and that\u2019s all done, they can enjoy a very quick cup of coffee with no need to source hot water to dissolve powder or dilute the coffee unless they want to.\u201d\n\nFoodNavigator-Asia has asked experts in India to weigh in with recommendations for India\u2019s spice sector bounce back from two high profile contamination scandals this year.\n\nCarcinogenic ethylene oxide is a pesticide that was found in spice powders from major Indian brands Everest and MDH, putting the country\u2019s spice industry under intense scrutiny.\n\nThis has led to bans in Hong Kong and the Maldives, product recalls in Singapore, and stricter checks on India\u2019s spices in Australia and the US.\n\nDespite the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) emphasising its stringent regulations, overseas bans and domestic concerns raised questions about the effectiveness of these measures.\n\nFollowing the Hong Kong ban on 5 April, FSSAI issued a statement on 8 April that raised the maximum residue limits (MRL) of pesticides by 10 times from 0.01mg/kg to 0.1mg/kg.\n\nAlthough FSSAI clarified that these only applies to pesticides not registered with the Indian authorities, and that the international Codex standards were adhered to, it sparked criticism and confusion.\n\n\u201cIt does seem counterintuitive for the FSSAI to increase the MRL for pesticides not registered with authorities, especially considering the potential health implications,\u201d Equinox Labs CEO Ashwin Bhadri said.\n\n\u201cThe implications of such a decision could be significant, as it may lead to increased pesticide residues in food products, potentially impacting consumer health in the long term.\n\n\u201cIt may also raise doubts about the effectiveness of regulatory measures in ensuring food safety and quality.\u201d\n\nThe Indonesian government has revised food packaging regulations in response to consumer and academic concerns over the presence of dangerous chemicals entering the food supply chain.\n\nAs of 2023, Indonesia had no specific regulations in place regarding certain harmful chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), more commonly known as the \u2018Forever Chemicals\u2019 due to their slow degradation rate.\n\nA great deal of scientific evidence already linked PFAS exposure to an array of health issues from cancer, cardiovascular disease, infertility, elevated blood pressure and more.\n\n\u201cIndonesia currently has no regulations on PFAS in food packaging [but] the troubling findings from our study indicate that we need stronger regulations to protect our children and families from exposures to toxic PFAS chemicals especially in daily products,\u201d Nexus3 Senior Advisor Yuyun Ismawati said whilst announcing the study findings.\n\n\u201cPFAS can also be released when people wear clothing, during washing, and when used synthetic textile wastes are disposed \u2013 [this] can contaminate waterways, leading to PFAS exposures from contaminated drinking water or food.\u201d\n\nFoodNavigator-Asia took a closer look at five of the top trends affecting the Asia Pacific food and beverage industry in 2024.\n\nThese included the \u2018premium affordability\u2019 trend surfaced by many food firms, as well as the evolution of plant-based protein to moving away from mimicry in innovation.\n\nOther significant trends included the rise of ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages driven by convenience and relatability, the continuous rise of low-to-no alcohol, and major factors behind the growth of the snacking industry.\n\nThe European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) has faced major pushback from ministers and trade organisations within Europe, as well as alongside continued pressure from palm oil producer nations in Asia this year.\n\nOn March 28 2024, an industry-wide cross-commodity letter was addressed to EC President of the Council for Environment and Minister for the Climate, the Environment, Sustainable Development and the Green Deal of Belgium Zakia Khattabi, calling for \u2018urgent clarifications and workable solutions\u2019 on EUDR implementation.\n\nThis was signed by a coalition of more than 20 European industry organisations spanning many areas of trade, including representatives on food trade in cereals, oils, rice, livestock, meat and more \u2013 all highlighting concerns over the supposed enforcement in December 2024.\n\n\u201cConsidering the significant adjustments that are needed from suppliers, operators and traders, we would like to express serious concerns regarding the pace of preparation of EUDR-related legislative acts, the mandatory systems and the guidance and clarifications required for implementation,\u201d the coalition said in the letter, which FoodNavigator-Asia has viewed.\n\n\u201cOperators and traders are working hard to prepare their supply chains and adapt their systems and due diligence processes for compliance with the EUDR [and] try to develop workable solutions compatible with the EUDR provisions.\n\n\u201cHowever, these efforts are impeded by large gaps in information, lack of appropriate technical solutions and by misconceptions as to the functioning of our complex chains.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean government has planned to mandate label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, replacing this with a digital QR code system over the next two years.\n\nSouth Korea committed to a range of sustainability goals, including the slashing of plastic waste production by 50% and the doubling of recycling rates in the country from 34% to 70%, both by 2030.\n\nThis year\u2019s developments saw the ministry calling for public comment on an initiative to mandate the use of label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, to be implemented after a two-year transition period.\n\n\u201cIn order to reduce the amount of label waste in the country from drinking water bottles and improve the efficiency of recycling systems locally, we will introduce a new label-free QR code system for all such bottles,\u201d MoE said via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cFrom January 1 2026, all individual types of drinking water bottles such as mineral waters that are manufactured in Korea will be subject to this change.\n\n\u201cAs the label-free QR code display method is mandated for target audiences, we aim to start with a smooth trial operation and early conversion [in order to] reflect any industry difficulties regarding displaying any necessary sales information via the QR code, as well as to determine the scope for product promotion and advertising.\u201d\n\nGlobal food corporation Cargill has leveraged its cocoa-sourcing networks in Asia and other business units to support customers in overcoming the cocoa supply shortage, and ensure consumers continue to have access to chocolate products.\n\nAccording to the International Cocoa Organization, global cocoa supply is projected to decline by nearly 11% to 4.449m tonnes in the 2023-2024 season, compared with 2022-23.\n\nThis is primarily caused by \u201ccatastrophic harvests\u201d in Ghana and Ivory Coast, which are responsible for over 60% of the world\u2019s cocoa supply.\n\nIn the face of this crisis, Cargill has drawn on its extensive cocoa sourcing networks and innovation expertise to help customers address current challenges, and ensure consumers still get to enjoy chocolate products.\n\n\u201cCocoa supply is indeed a pressing issue for the industry. Cargill is a bean-to-bar solutions provider, which means that we have the capabilities to innovate along every step of the value chain, from sourcing of raw materials to product customisation and solutions provision. For example, we are able to provide Asian-sourced cocoa products as we source globally.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are actively reaching out to our customers to see if they need support in managing this situation, such as sourcing, alternative recipes and product trials. We are able to tailor-make cocoa powder for a certain flavour and colour, and combine different ingredients to create new solutions or replacements,\u201d Xiaoling Liu, Indulgence Leader, Food Solutions Asia Pacific at Cargill, told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nThe EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) has faced pressure from within its own Parliament to postpone implementation as an \u2018urgent\u2019 matter this year, with concerns over key trade commodities such as palm oil and cocoa.\n\nThe EUDR received much criticism particularly from palm oil industry experts and countries producing key commodities likely to be affected such as palm oil, cocoa and coffee, and came under fire from within the EU parliament as well.\n\nThis dissent was led by European Peoples\u2019 Party (EPP) environmental spokesperson Peter Liese, who pushed for an \u2018urgent\u2019 postponement and \u2018far less bureaucratic\u2019 implementation of the EUDR.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the EUDR is correct, but its implementation is far too bureaucratic [and] the European Commission absolutely must postpone the entry into force of the deforestation regulation, then use the transitional period to reduce bureaucracy in the text,\u201d he said via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cWe must do something about deforestation worldwide and take our responsibility seriously, [however] the regulation has been turned into a bureaucratic monster - Many small farmers around the world and even small forest owners in the European Union cannot work with the text.\n\n\u201cThe preparatory work that the Commission should have carried out has not been done [and many] countries are complaining massively about the legislation, including countries that are pursuing the same goal as we are, namely to stop deforestation.\n\nAs of time of writing, the EUDR implementation has been postponed to the end of 2025.\n\nResearchers in India have highlighted that the misuse of antibiotics in food animal production in Asia could pose a serious danger to public health in the region.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a significant global threat, causing substantial economic losses and an estimated annual loss of 700,000 lives.\n\nResearchers at the Veterinary and Animal Sciences University in Punjab noted the alarming rise of antibiotic resistance and its potential transmission to humans through the food chain.\n\nThey also shed light on the pervasive use of critically important antibiotics in food animal production across Asia as well as how limited surveillance and regulatory controls had amplified concerns over antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe study encompassed 11 WHO member countries \u2014 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste.\n\nResults from the review of 108 selected publications revealed a staggering 1,126 scientific publications on antibiotic use in food animals, wherein the study identified a concerning trend of antibiotic misuse in livestock, poultry and aquaculture.\n\nChina\u2019s removal of tariffs on all dairy products from New Zealand has been posited to spell huge potential for brands with a strong focus on quality and sustainability.\n\nChina and New Zealand signed a free trade agreement (FTA) in 2008, but with regard to dairy it took 16 years to finally see all tariffs removed.\n\nAccording to New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade data, New Zealand was the first developed country in the world to enter into an FTA with China.\n\nVarious New Zealand dairy products have seen export tariff decreases over the years, but although many of these hit zero in 2019, duties were still in place for liquid milk, butter and cheese until 2021; and for milk powder until Dec 31 2023.\n\nAs of Jan 1 this year, all tariffs were officially declared to have been removed by the Chinese Embassy in New Zealand via a formal statement, which was warmly welcomed by New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay.\n\n\u201cAll safeguard duties on milk powder [entering China] have been removed as of January 1 2024, which marks the final liberalisation of dairy access under the [China-New Zealand] FTA,\u201d McClay announced via a separate statement."

Some of the yuppies' favorite words are mesquite. Disc as in floppy or digital or K as in floors, not margarine, sports medicine, and of course user friendly. Now *** sure way to spot *** yuppie is by the cars they drive and the food they eat. Let's just call it yuppy chow. It includes anything on *** menu you can't pronounce or anything raw like broccoli or or raw fish. You see, the yuppie theory is to eat the food raw and then immediately jump in the jacuzzi. That way it cooks inside your body. What about you? Are you one? Well, here's *** test to see. Question number one. Have you ever ordered tofu substitute instead of ice cream, even though you knew deep down the tofu had just as many calories? Question 2. Have you ever bought *** product solely because it had *** brand name you couldn't pronounce? Question number 3. Have you ever gone out of your way to find Linguini or vermicelli, even though you knew it was the same thing as spaghetti? And question number 4, have you ever spent hours agonizing over why Jane Fonda married Tom Hayden, even though Woody Allen is still available? Well, if you answered yes to any of these, you're *** hopelessly addicted yuppie, which, by the way, is *** thing of the past for two reasons. The first is purely economic. Consider this While only 4% of all baby boomers make over $45,000 *** year, The demand for luxury goods and services is at an all-time high. So too is consumer debt, up 18% in the last year alone. When the ad said by, the yuppies said yup, and now they're out of cash. The second reason is the fact that the yuppie is *** trend, *** trend that has gone the way of all trends. As *** trend moves across the country and it finds its way into the local high schools, for instance. The trendsetter is off somewhere else. So what trend is around the corner? What I detect is *** much more conservative kind of trend running through this country. It's *** trend that says home values are more important, religious values are more important. The profit line is not as important as it used to be. There is *** trend in the country right now. Maybe away from some of the pain connected with buying and buying and buying and maybe the low level of pleasure that comes out of that. No matter what the current trend is, one day the pendulum will swing toward consumerism again, and when the baby boomers are called senior citizens, the chances are when the TV says bye, they'll say it right now.

Even if we try to avoid them, these new slang terms are spreading and being used all around us.Related video above: RETRO SLANG: Do you know what a yuppie is?While it used to be that language mostly evolved through watching TV programs, listening to the radio and slowly adopting terms through conversation, now language is evolving through the reception of viral, one-minute videos. And as more and more people spend time on TikTok, Facebook and Instagram, more and more videos are gaining levels of popularity that used to be rare to achieve. Through this increased interaction with others, language is changing faster than many can track.The impact of social media on languageSocial media has transformed much of how we communicate in 2024. According to Statista, 5.22 billion people (63.8% of the world\u2019s population) use social media. That\u2019s up from 4.7 billion in 2020 and a far cry from the 2.79 billion in 2014, according to statistics gathered by Our World in Data.While social media used to be a niche method of communication, it is now a fully integrated function in everyday life \u2014 and its effect on how we interact with each other is vast.\u201cUnlike traditional media, where language change often trickled down from elite cultural centers, social media allows users from diverse backgrounds to participate in and influence linguistic trends,\u201d Tony Dembe wrote in \u201cThe Impact of Social Media on Language Evolution.\u201dThese diverse backgrounds can be based on age, location, hobbies or which social media platform one regularly uses. For instance, the term \u201cskibidi\u201d was popularized in large part by younger consumers who watched the immensely popular YouTube series \u201cSkibidi Toilet.\u201d\u201cRizz,\u201d on the other hand, gained traction through its use by viewers of the Twitch streamer Kai Cenat, who Dictionary.com credits with inventing the term.The trending word \u201cdemure\u201d is attributed to Jools Lebron, who redefined the term in a series of viral TikTok videos this year.While social media is a common thread in the rise of popularity for these terms, the specific platforms they originated from vary. But with the increased use of social media, these consumer subdivisions can easily overlap through just the click of a button, providing a quick and effective way for slang to spread and influence the general population.New language adopted in 2024While some may have been able to avoid adopting the new terms popping up around the country, their usage is becoming more normalized as the world attempts to keep up with how fast these words are being rolled out.The redefined \u201cdemure\u201d hit new heights of fame after being popularized by Lebron this summer, becoming Dictionary.com\u2019s 2024 Word of the Year with only a few months to achieve the title. \u201cDemure\u201d saw a \u201c1200% increase in usage in digital web media alone\u201d after Lebron redefined the term from its original meaning \u2014 reserved or modest \u2014 to refined and sophisticated. While oftentimes these new words and phrases can remain niche or specific to certain communities, \u201cdemure\u201d was able to quickly break out and enter the general English lexicon.The term has been used by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez and Penn Badgley. It was also employed by the White House in a post on X regarding the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s efforts to cancel many people\u2019s student debt. Its popularity even sent Lebron to the big screen, opening the door for the TikTok star to make an appearance on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d The term\u2019s expansive reach has certainly made its new definition widely known, if not cemented in history.Similarly, the term \u201cunalive\u201d has grown out of its original corner of the internet. The term is a common example of \u201calgospeak,\u201d which refers to words and phrases used to avoid the censorship levied on some social media platforms. \u201cUnalive\u201d became code for \u201cdead\u201d and was often used in discussions of homicides, mental health and suicide.While the word could have stayed platform-specific, depending on which moderation systems flagged the more standard terms referring to death, \u201cunalive\u201d quickly became used in general conversations. Even more surprising, the term created controversy when \u201cunalive\u201d was reportedly used on a placard describing Kurt Cobain\u2019s death at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle. The placard read, \u201cKurt Cobain un-alived himself at 27,\u201d a phrasing that many found disrespectful of the former lead singer of Nirvana. While the museum seemingly revised the placard to use the phrase \u201cdied by suicide\u201d instead of the slang term, according to a report by CNN, the initial use of the term in such a formal setting may suggest that social media-based slang is in the process of being less stigmatized as it\u2019s adopted by the general population. However, there is clearly still a long road ahead before it is officially welcomed into the English language.The social media generationsFor insight into how language is changing and how it may evolve in the future, look no further than Generation Alpha.While Generation Z grew up alongside the evolution of the internet, smartphones and the beginning of social media, Gen Alpha is growing up with more advanced social media systems already integrated into regular life.\u201cI think that their generation right now is social media natives,\u201d Payton Miller, a member of Gen Z and an eighth-grade English teacher, said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m noticing a difference between the 12th graders that I had, who would use words that I recognized from social media and especially TikTok, but it seemed to not come as naturally to them. But these kids are 13. \u2026 They consistently use social media as, like, a way to communicate and have for a really long time.\u201dBecause of their exposure to social media, you may have heard many members of Gen Alpha use terms that used to be alien to most English speakers, such as \u201cskibidi,\u201d \u201cglizzy\u201d and \u201csigma.\u201dWhile some of these new terms seem to have no meaning, such as \u201cskibidi\u201d and \u201csigma,\u201d which appear to have shed their original definitions, others are simply replacements for words or concepts that are already known.\u201cEvery 15 seconds, something that already exists has a new name,\u201d Miller explained. \u201cEvery day, there are new things happening, and because kids are sponges, they can change with it.\u201dWith social media\u2019s tendency to promote quick, short-form content, videos using new slang terms are being consumed at higher rates, causing their audiences to learn new words faster than with traditional media like TV and theater.And this audience is, in large part, composed of Gen Alpha. According to the Pew Research Center, across the platforms of YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook, \u201cone-third of teens use at least one of these sites almost constantly.\u201d\u201cNow, more than before, there is, like, such a quick evolution of language, and it happens almost instantaneously,\u201d Miller added. \u201cAnd language has always been, like, a living, breathing thing, but it happens so fast now.\u201dWith this common consumption of social media, a sense of community appears to have grown out of the shared understanding of these new terms \u2014 and with it, a clear distinction between those in the know and those who are not.\u201cThey all seem to, like, have it instantly. If one kid is saying something, they all know what that person means, even if I\u2019ve never heard it in my life,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey can say stuff that to me, as, like, a Gen Z person, is completely, like, incomprehensible. But they know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201dThis is similar to when Gen Z and Millennials used terms and phrases like \u201cOK, boomer\u201d to draw a line between them and the baby boomer generation. Language can be a unifying tool as much as it can provide a sense of independence from those who can\u2019t understand it. In this context, not much has changed.But the quantity of new words entering circulation and the speed with which they spread can be confounding, and, unsurprisingly, the slang is being met with resistance. Social media\u2019s influence on language is often attributed to the newly popularized term \u201cbrain rot,\u201d Oxford\u2019s 2024 Word of the Year, which commonly refers to the negative impacts of overconsuming online content. Through this lens, many believe language is deteriorating, being too easily influenced by unintelligent sources.It\u2019s hard to determine how language will continue to evolve from here as social media continues to grow and technology advances, but for now, it seems keeping up with its changes is difficult to manage without a constant online presence or a personal Gen Alpha tutor.The constant we can rely on, however, is that language will always be subject to the creativity of those who use it, even if it can be difficult to keep up with.If you want to do more research, here are some new, redefined or resurfacing words and phrases that you can look further into:BrainrotBrat Fanum taxFeltGlazingGlizzy GyattI'm going to crash outMewingMoggingOhioRizzStood on businessYapping"

            "article_content": "Earlier this month, researchers announced they found the smallest asteroids ever detected within the main belt, which is a field between Mars and Jupiter where millions of asteroids orbit. With this discovery, scientists say they can now identify and track asteroids that are likely to approach Earth more accurately and efficiently.\n\nEvery few years, an asteroid roughly the size of a bus \u2014 or a Boston Duck Tour boat \u2014 can strike Earth and send shockwaves through entire regions, researchers say. Now, a key advancement in planetary defense has been made by astronomers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other researchers, authorities said.\n\nOn the morning of June 30, 1908, an asteroid plunged into Earth\u2019s atmosphere and exploded over Siberia, Russia, creating a blast zone nearly three times the size of Chicago. In 2013, an asteroid unleashed a loud sonic boom and shockwave over Chelyabinsk, Russia that injured hundreds and damaged thousands of buildings.\n\n\u201cWe now have a way of spotting these small asteroids when they are much farther away, so we can do more precise orbital tracking, which is key for planetary defense,\u201d Artem Burdanov, the study\u2019s lead-author and research scientist at MIT, said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearchers have now located more than 100 new \u201cdecameter\u201d asteroids, asteroids tens of meters in size, in the main asteroid belt, according to a paper published in Nature. These \u201cdecameter\u201d asteroids are more likely to escape the main asteroid belt and plunge into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nRichard Binzel, research co-author and MIT professor of planetary science, said astronomers usually alert the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge of any detected objects approaching Earth.\n\n\u201cOnce those observations are at [the center], everyone can see those observations... and try to identify if the object will collide with Earth and where it will happen,\u201d Binzel said in an interview last week.\n\nA comparison of how many asteroids can now be detected with the team\u2019s detection method. Ella Maru/Julien de Wit\n\nUntil now, the smallest asteroids astronomers have been able to detect are around one kilometer, which is 1000 meters, researchers said. With this breakthrough, astronomers can now spot asteroids as small as 10 meters.\n\n\u201cThis is a totally new, unexplored space we are entering, thanks to modern technologies,\u201d Burdanov said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study\u2019s lead astronomers used data from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and \u201crecycled\u201d an image processing technique originally used to search for exoplanets to search for asteroids, researchers said.\n\n\u201cJWST has been observing the sky with extreme precision to do exoplanetary science, which is what we usually do, but it just so happens that we can use its unparalleled data to find the smallest asteroid in the main belt ever,\u201d Julien de Wit, research co-author and MIT professor of planetary science, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nDe Wit referenced the asteroid that exploded over Chelyabinsk in 2013, stating that it had only been spotted a mere 12 hours before it collided with Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This is the asteroid that prompted NASA to form a Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) in 2016.\n\nNow, with the researchers\u2019 discoveries, astronomers can detect decameter asteroids much further in advance.\n\n\u201cWith new technology, we can find populations of asteroids that were inaccessible previously,\u201d De Wit said. \u201c...Now we have the capability to be able to study this object further out, predict the orbit with much better accuracy, and decide what to do for potential or possible future impactors.\u201d\n\nSabrina Lam can be reached at sabrina.lam@globe.com."

Thanks to Oslo, Norway-based startup Sensorita, a new bin monitoring system can help optimize construction waste management, reports Environment+Energy Leader.\n\nUsing smart sensors and digital twin technology, Sensorita is helping companies streamline their processes, cut costs, and save time while collecting waste.\n\nUntil now, collecting construction waste has been a manual, time-consuming process. E+E Leader reports that many waste management companies are not efficient because they lack access to critical real-time data, such as the location and fill levels of their bins.\n\nDo you think America could ever go zero-waste?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nThat's where Sensorita comes in. With the help of radar sensors and machine learning, the startup created digital twins of waste bins. This means companies can access real-time data on their bin locations and fill levels, optimizing collection schedules and eliminating unnecessary trips.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"By equipping construction waste bins with these sensors, the company offers real-time monitoring capabilities, enabling waste management firms to plan pickups based on actual data instead of rough estimates,\" wrote Kaleigh Harrison of E+E Leader.\n\nThe construction industry has a massive environmental footprint, surpassing the amount of municipal solid waste generate. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, construction and demolition accounted for 600 million tons of debris in the U.S. in 2018 alone.\n\nWithout real-time data, waste management companies make extra trips, wasting time and energy resources. With Sensorita, however, companies can implement more efficient waste management strategies while reducing their environmental footprints.\n\nSensorita has established a solid initial foundation in Norway. The company plans to expand its services outside Norway and to other regions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's also working on new capabilities for its sensor technology, specifically developing a sensor that detects the type of material in each waste bin. This would streamline sorting and pickup processes even more.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "With the global population aging, and rising concerns about mental health, loneliness, and social isolation, understanding and enhancing later-life satisfaction has become increasingly crucial for both individual and global health and productivity. The World Health Organization1 reports that by 2030, one out of six people will be 60 years or older, comprising 1.4 billion people, with those over 80 approaching half a billion.\n\nGiven the vast scope of this issue, it's surprising that we have a limited understanding of what preserves and enhances generativity in our later years, as research to date is still early-on. Along similar lines, increased generativity would be expected to enhance well-being, and protect against many of the negative outcomes currently associated with aging. With the global population getting older and the average human lifespan increasing, it is imperative to work out how to extend healthspan and productivity, meaning, purpose and community.\n\nDeveloping Machine Learning Approaches to Understand Complex Problems\n\nA recent study by Mohsen Joshanloo, Ph.D., published in the Journals of Gerontology (2024), took a novel approach using machine learning to extract key variables from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) dataset. This study included a wide range of psychological and demographic variables and measured generativity using the Loyola Generativity Scale. Participants ranged from 39 to 93 years old, with an average age of 63.64. Using maching learning allows us to make sense out of complicated data sets where standard statistical approaches may falter.\n\nFrom a broad perspective, a few key concepts help us understand aging across the lifespan. These include Erik Erikson\u2019s developmental model, especially Middle and Older Adulthood (below, with some flexibilty on the age spans given how long we're living nowadays); the balance of stability and plasticity (contributing to consistency and change); and the two major forms of well-being\u2014eudaimonic (meaning) and hedonic (pleasure), which need to be in harmony. Personality traits, measured by the Big Five (Five Factor Model, or FFM), play a role in this process, with some contributing to stability or plasticity. For example, openness to experience is linked with plasticity, while neuroticism, because of an anxious reluctance to take risks, is often associated with stability.\n\nSource: Robert.G Sacco, CC BY-SA 4.0 / Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe study used a \"Random Forest Analysis\" machine learning technique. This method builds multiple decision trees to sift through large datasets, identifying non-linear relationships and dynamic interactions. The model was trained on a subset of data and then tested against the rest to minimize prediction error and enhance accuracy. It analyzed 34 variables for 2,830 participants, after removing those with missing data and reducing the original 70 variables to a set of non-redundant measures.\n\nThe final model predicted 40% of the variance in generativity, revealing five key factors as the strongest predictors, ranked by significance:\n\nSocial Potency: Assertiveness, persuasion, and leadership orientation are crucial. Generativity is inherently social, requiring not just drive but also the interpersonal skills to lead and influence others. Openness: Mental flexibility and the ability to entertain new ideas and experiences are the second strongest predictors. This is consistent with the personality trait openness to experience, which has also been linked to giftedness2. Social Integration: This factor emphasizes the importance of social function in generativity. Beyond leadership, the ability to be part of a group, experience belonging, and find one\u2019s place in the social order is also critical. Social integration protects against loneliness, and the ill effects on health. Personal Growth: The drive for continuous development, particularly in later life, is another important contributor to generativity. As people age and face existential challenges, this drive to grow becomes even more significant. Achievement Orientation: The drive and passion to pursue goals is a key factor in generativity. A strong desire to get things done is inherently generative, though without the other factors, it may lack deeper meaning.\n\nAdditional important factors include a sense of purpose in life and self-acceptance, which highlight the importance of living a meaningful life (eudaimonia) and having a coherent life narrative. Generativity is influenced by how we view ourselves against the backdrop of our life story. Spiritual experiences also emerged as a relevant factor, pointing to the role of transcending quotidian concerns to see ourselves within a broader context.\n\nFactors that were not significant in this model included demographic and health factors such as gender, health status, and socioeconomic variables. While these factors have been important predictors of well-being and life satisfaction in other studies, the machine learning analysis suggests they may not be the most crucial drivers of generativity, though they likely influence the key factors mentioned above. They may be necessary but not sufficient for generativity, perhaps accomplishments from earlier stages of life and provision of basic needs, providing stability and an all-important springboard for generativity into later life.\n\nBecause the dataset is cross-sectional, the results are correlational rather than causal. Future research using machine learning approaches such as Random Forest Analysis, and others, could look at longitudinal data sets to determine causality and further explore additional variables that may influence generativity. Hybrid intelligence, synergizing human and artificial minds to go beyond the capacity of either alone, holds promise for addressing knotty problems.\n\nLiving Large\n\nWhile the jury is still out, this study identifies important factors which, beyond their statistical significance, make a certain intuitive sense when contemplating how to flourish and increase generativity as we grow older. Rather than fading away, focusing on social factors including both leadership and belonging emerges as important. Cultivating mental flexibility and openness to experience are core. Stability is important, but in excess may lead to stagnation, and failure to take necessary risks.\n\nPlasticity factors dovetail with personal growth orientation, flowing together into Erikson's last two developmental tasks: Middle Adulthood Generativity vs. Stagnation, and Late Adulthood Integrity vs. Despair. It's important to maintain ambition as part of the story, but not to an extreme, understand who we are and where we fit into a broader sense of purpose and meaning, and at the same time enjoy ourselves along the way."

Meanwhile, Zelensky put the figure much higher, at over 3,000.\n\nThe Ukrainian president has warned that more North Korean troops will likely join the invading Russian forces, criticising world leaders for doing \u201calmost nothing\u201d to curb collaboration between the two nations.\n\nSouth Korean military sources have corroborated his claim, saying there is evidence that North Korea is preparing to send more resources to Russia.\n\n\u201cFighting for money\u201d: What did Zelensky say about Slovakia PM Robert Fico?\n\n09:15 , Albert Toth\n\nUkraine\u2019s president Zelensky has expressed his dismay at the meeting between Slovakian PM Robert Fico and Putin over gas exports.\n\nTaking to Twitter / X, he wrote: \u201cThere have been many questions from journalists today about Fico\u2019s trip to Moscow. In fact, after our conversation in Brussels in the presence of all European leaders, nothing surprises anymore.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting for our lives, Fico is fighting for money, and it\u2019s unlikely that money is for Slovakia. Shadow agreements with Putin are either a trade of state interests or working for personal gain.\n\n\u201cWe offered him solutions regarding potential compensation for Slovaks \u2013 the Slovaks specifically \u2013 for losses from Russian transit, as well as alternatives for transit \u2013 any other gas, not Russian, at the request of the European Commission. We were ready to do this. Fico did not want compensation for the Slovaks. And he does not want to cooperate with the European Commission. For some reason, he finds Moscow more profitable.\n\n\u201cEveryone in Europe understands why.

Mr Fico had accused Mr Zelensky of opposing any gas transit through Ukraine to Slovakia, which is dependent on gas supplies piped in via its neighbour.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly said it will not extend an existing transit deal for gas flows from Russia to Europe, which expires on 1 January. Payments for the gas have helped Russia to wage its almost three-year war in Ukraine, Kyiv says.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader said Mr Fico had been offered possible compensation for Slovakia for losses resulting from the expiry, as well as transit alternatives for non-Russian gas.\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Slovak prime minister Robert Fico during a meeting in Moscow (Reuters)\n\n\u201cFico did not want compensation for the Slovaks,\u201d Mr Zelensky said in his evening address.\n\nSlovakia, which has a long-term contract with Russia\u2019s Gazprom, has said buying in gas from elsewhere would cost it $229m more in transit expenses.\n\nMr Zelensky gave no further details on the compensation offer but earlier on Monday said that Mr Fico was interested only in Russian gas and that \u00a3398m per year was at stake.\n\nMr Fico said last week that Mr Zelensky had offered \u20ac500m (\u00a3414m), which he said had been tied to Nato membership and was from Russian assets that the Slovak leader said Ukraine did not possess.\n\n\u201cPresident (Zelensky) came back to the subject of gas and asked me if I would then vote for Nato membership if he gave me 500m euros of Russian assets, and of course, I said \u2018never\u2019,\u201d said Mr Fico, who has opposed Ukraine\u2019s bid for a place in the transatlantic security alliance.\n\nWho was Igor Kirillov, Russian general killed by bomb in Moscow?\n\n03:01 , Tom Watling\n\nWho was Igor Kirillov, senior Russian general killed by bombing in Moscow?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to feel festive, say Ukrainians marking third Christmas in UK\n\n02:57 , Namita Singh\n\nUkrainians in the UK, marking their third Christmas away from home and another milestone since Russia\u2019s invasion, have said it can be \u201cdifficult to be in a festive mood\u201d.\n\nMaria Romanenko, 32, left the Kyiv region for Manchester shortly after the Russian invasion began on 24 February 2022, alongside her Mancunian partner Jez.\n\nThe couple made a perilous journey to the Polish border, where they had to wait four days for confirmation that Maria would be allowed to enter the UK with Jez.

It added that Kim would have been \u201cfully aware that the individuals were civilians and not participating in the armed conflict\u201d.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an emailed comment to Reuters that \u201cthe Russian military only strikes military infrastructure\u201d in Ukraine.\n\nRussian delegation arrives in Iran for meeting with president\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 10:05 , Tom Watling\n\nA Russian delegation arrived in Tehran for a visit that includes a meeting with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Russian state news agency TASS reported on Monday, as the two countries prepare to sign a comprehensive cooperation agreement.\n\nIran and Russia have been working on setting a date to complete an agreement, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday, adding that the deal is set to be signed during a bilateral visit in January.\n\nRussia has cultivated closer ties with Iran and other countries hostile towards the United States, such as North Korea, since the start of the Ukraine war.\n\nThe country\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in October that Moscow and Tehran intended to sign a deal which would include closer defence cooperation.\n\nSouth Korea detects signs of North Korea preparing more troops, drones for Russia\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 09:33 , Tom Watling\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s military said on Monday that it has detected signs of North Korea preparing to send more troops and weapons, including suicide drones, to Russia to support its war against Ukraine.\n\nNorth Korea has already provided 240mm multiple rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled howitzers, and was seen preparing to produce more suicide drones to be shipped to Russia after leader Kim Jong Un guided a test last month, according to Seoul\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).\n\n\u201cSuicide drones are one of the tasks that Kim Jong Un has focused on,\u201d a JCS official said, adding that the North had expressed its intention to give them to Russia.\n\nSuch drones have been widely used in the Ukraine war, and Kim ordered a mass production of the aerial weapons and an update of military theory and education, citing intensifying global competition, state media reported.\n\nSeoul, Washington and Kyiv have said there are around 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia. The JCS said at least 1,100 of them had been killed or wounded, in line with last week\u2019s briefing by South Korea\u2019s spy agency which reported some 100 deaths with another 1,000 wounded in the Kursk region.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center left, meets soldiers during a visit to a western operational training base in North Korea (AP)\n\nPope Francis calls for a ceasefire on all fronts in his prayer ahead of Christmas\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 09:07 , Tom Watling\n\nPope Francis calls for a ceasefire on all fronts in his prayer ahead of Christmas\n\nPutin \u2018wants to meet Trump as soon as possible\u2019\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 08:04 , Namita Singh\n\nUS president-elect Donald Trump said Russian president Vladimir Putin has expressed his interest in a meeting him to discuss the Ukraine war.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin said that he wants to meet with me as soon as possible,\u201d Mr Trump said during his remarks at Turning Point\u2019s America Fest convention yesterday. \u201cSo we have to wait for this, but we have to end that war. That war is horrible, horrible,\u201d he was quoted as saying by CNBC.\n\nUS president-elect Donald Trump speaks during Turning Point\u2019s annual AmericaFest 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona, on 22 December 2024 (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe number of soldiers being killed...\u201d Mr Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a flat plane, and the bullets are going and there\u2019s powerful bullets, powerful guns, and the only thing that\u2019s going to stop them is a human body.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Mr Trump has claimed he could end the Ukraine war \u201cin 24 hours\u201d if he gets elected.\n\nUkraine says it shot down 47 Russia launched drones\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 07:32 , Namita Singh\n\nUkraine\u2019s air force said it had shot down 47 out of 72 Russia-launched drones across the country.\n\nIn a statement on Telegram this morning, it said that an additional 25 drones had not reached targets and were \u201clocationally lost\u201d.\n\nGazprom to send 42.1 mcm of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Monday\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 07:30 , Namita Singh\n\nRussia\u2019s Gazprom said that it would send 42.1 million cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine this morning, a volume in line with recent days.\n\nNato chief Rutte says Zelensky\u2019s criticism of Germany\u2019s Scholz is unfair\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 07:18 , Namita Singh\n\nNato secretary general Mark Rutte said he considered the sometimes harsh criticism of German chancellor Olaf Scholz by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to be unjustified, news wire DPA reported.\n\nAlthough Germany has been a vital ally of Ukraine, its hesitation in providing long-range Taurus cruise missiles has been a source of frustration in Kyiv, which is battling a foe armed with a powerful array of long-range weaponry.\n\n\u201cI have often told Zelenskiy that he should stop criticising Olaf Scholz, because I think it is unfair,\u201d DPA quoted Mr Rutte on Monday as saying in an interview.\n\nNato secretary general Mark Rutte visits Novo Selo military base in Bulgaria (EPA)\n\nMr Rutte also said that he, unlike Mr Scholz, would supply Ukraine with Taurus cruise missiles and would not set limits on their use.\n\n\u201cIn general, we know that such capabilities are very important for Ukraine,\u201dMr Rutte said, adding that it was not up to him to decide what allies should deliver.\n\nAfter a November telephone call by Mr Scholz with Russia\u2019s leader Vladimir Putin in November, Mr Zelensky said it had opened a Pandora\u2019s box that undermined efforts to isolate the Russian leader and end the war in Ukraine with a \u201cfair peace\u201d.\n\nUkraine launch cross-border attack on fuel and energy facilities\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 07:00 , Holly Evans\n\nUkrainian drones struck a major Russian fuel depot for the second time in just over a week on Sunday, according to a senior Russian regional official, as part of a \u201cmassive\u201d cross-border attack on fuel and energy facilities that Kyiv says supply Moscow\u2019s military.\n\nThe strikes came days after Russia launched sweeping attacks on Ukraine\u2019s already battered energy grid, threatening to plunge thousands of homes into darkness as winter tightens its grip over the region, and as Russia\u2019s all-out invasion of its neighbor nears the three-year mark.\n\nA fire broke out at the Stalnoy Kon oil terminal in Russia\u2019s southern Oryol region, local Gov.

Mr Jenkins\u2019s hands were bound by tape as he answered questions about his identity in English and broken Russian. In the footage circulating online, the man, dressed in military fatigue, could be seen being struck on his head with a cane, as he said: \u201cI\u2019m Australian\u2026Oscar Jenkins. 32 years old \u2026 I study biology.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is concerning news, and we\u2019re working through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to provide support, including, for this gentleman, trying to ascertain the details and the facts which are there,\u201d Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese told reporters on Monday morning.\n\nThe acting foreign affair minister Mark Dreyfus, meanwhile urged Russia to treat Mr Jenkins as per international laws.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Russian government to fully adhere to its obligations under international humanitarian law, including with respect to prisoners of war.

However, Mr Korsunsky\u2019s successor in Japan has not yet been announced. He is expected to stay in the country till February, he told NHK.\n\nMr Korsunsky, named as ambassador to Japan in 2020, has been actively campaigning across the Asian nation, seeking support for his country and had in past expressed gratitude for the monetary donations delivered to the Ukrainian embassy in Ukraine.\n\nNorth Korea aiding Russia where it needs it most, says Canadian general\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 05:30 , Namita Singh\n\nThrough the supply of troops and weapons, North Korea is aiding Moscow in the areas it needs the most support, said a Canadian general.\n\n\u201cNorth Koreans are not only replacing some Russian personnel but they are also making up for the lack of munitions and other assets that Russia either can\u2019t produce on its own or can\u2019t replace as fast as needed to sustain a war of attrition like this one,\u201d Major General Greg Smith, director-general of international security policy with Canada\u2019s Department of National Defence told The Japan Times.\n\n\u201cThis means that North Koreans are physically fighting and dying for Russia, which is a very troubling development that highlights the growing internationalization of the conflict,\u201d Mr Smith told the outlet.\n\nThe remarks come as Washington and Kyiv recently claimed that North Korean soldiers took heavy casualties while fighting Ukrainian forces in the Russian border region.\n\nThe Ukrainian military intelligence agency said at least 30 North Korean troops were killed or wounded, while a US official suggested the figure for North Korean casualties was in the \u201cseveral hundreds\u201d.\n\nUkraine says Russian general deliberately targeted Reuters staff in August missile strike\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 05:15 , Namita Singh\n\nUkraine\u2019s security service has named a Russian general it suspects of ordering a missile strike on a hotel in eastern Ukraine in August and said he acted \u201cwith the motive of deliberately killing employees of\u201d Reuters.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said in a statement on Friday that Colonel General Alexei Kim, a deputy chief of Russia\u2019s General Staff, approved the strike that killed Reuters safety adviser Ryan Evans and wounded two of the agency\u2019s journalists on 24 August.\n\nIn a statement posted on Telegram messenger the SBU said it was notifying Mr Kim in absentia that he was an official suspect in its investigation into the strike on the Sapphire Hotel in Kramatorsk, a step in Ukrainian criminal proceedings that can later lead to charges.\n\nPeople wearing military clothes walk past a destroyed building of a local university, amid Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine, in the town of Pokrovsk, near a front line in Donetsk region, Ukraine 19 December 2024 (Reuters)\n\nIn a separate, 15-page notice of suspicion, in which the SBU set out findings from its investigation, the agency said that the decision to fire the missile was made \u201cwith the motive of deliberately killing employees of the international news agency Reuters who were engaged in journalistic activities in Ukraine\u201d.\n\nThe document, which was published on the website of the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office on Friday, said that Mr Kim had received intelligence that Reuters staff were staying in Kramatorsk.

The village of Sontsivka, north of Kurakhove, was also captured.\n\nThe ministry on Saturday announced the capture of another village near Kurakhove, Kostiantynopolske.\n\nThe Ukraine military\u2019s general staff made no mention of those villages falling into Russian hands, but said Sontsivka was in a sector subject to 26 Russian attacks in the past 24 hours. The general staff also reported heavy fighting near Pokrovsk, with 34 Russian attempts to pierce defences.\n\nThe popular Ukrainian military blog DeepState said Sontsivka was under Russian control.\n\nRussian reports have described intensified pressure on Kurakhove.\n\nWho are the other European leaders who met Putin?\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 04:36 , Namita Singh\n\nVisits and phone calls from European leaders to Vladimir Putin have been rare since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine, although Hungary\u2019s prime minister Viktor Orban visited Russia in July, and Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer met with the Russian leader just weeks into the full-scale war.\n\nBoth trips drew condemnation from Kyiv and European leaders.\n\nMr Orban, widely seen as having the warmest relations with Mr Putin among EU leaders, has routinely blocked, delayed or watered down EU efforts to assist Kyiv and impose sanctions on Moscow for its actions in Ukraine.\n\nHe has long argued for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine but without outlining what that might mean for the country\u2019s territorial integrity or future security.\n\nVladimir Putin shakes hands with Slovakia\u2019s prime minister Robert Fico prior to their talks in Moscow on 22 December 2024 (AFP via Getty Images)\n\nRussian pressident Vladimir Putin meets Slovak prime minister Robert Fico in Moscow (EPA)\n\nMr Fico\u2019s views on Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine differ sharply from most other European leaders. The Slovakian PM returned to power last year after his leftist party Smer won parliamentary elections on a pro-Russia and anti-American platform. Since then, he has ended his country\u2019s military aid for Ukraine, lashed out at EU sanctions on Russia, and vowed to block Ukraine from joining Nato.\n\nMr Fico has also been a rare senior EU politician to appear on Russian state TV following Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In an interview with the Rossiya-1 channel in October, he contended the West has \u201cprolonged the war\u201d by supporting Ukraine, adding that sanctions against Russia were ineffective. He declared that he was ready to negotiate with Putin.\n\nMr Fico also vowed to attend a military parade in Moscow next May that will mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany\u2019s defeat in World War II. The Kremlin has used the annual \u201cVictory Day\u201d celebrations to tout its battlefield prowess, and Putin hailed Russian troops fighting in Ukraine as \u201cheroes\u201d at this year\u2019s event.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind Fico\u2019s rare visit to Russia\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 04:21 , Namita Singh\n\nRobert Fico\u2019s visit to Moscow was reaction to Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s opposition to gas transit to Slovakia through Ukraine.\n\nSharing details about his visit, Mr Fico said on Facebook that Ukrainian president supported sanctions against Russia\u2019s nuclear program, which was against Slovakia\u2019s interest as it relied on nuclear energy.\n\nMr Fico said Mr Putin confirmed to him that Russia is still ready to deliver gas to the West. He said the two also discussed the military situation in Ukraine, chances for a peaceful solution to the war and the bilateral relations between their two countries which Fico said they will seek to \u201cstandardise.\u201d\n\nVladimir Putin and Robert Fico pose for a photo during their meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow, (AP)\n\nHis trip, however, was condemned by the major Slovak opposition parties.\n\nSlovakia last month signed a short-term pilot contract to buy natural gas from Azerbaijan, as it prepares for a possible halt to Russian supplies through Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this year, it struck a deal to import US liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland.\n\nThe country can also receive gas through Austrian, Hungarian and Czech networks, enabling imports from Germany among other potential suppliers.\n\nUkraine says Russian forces executed five POWs\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 04:00 , Holly Evans\n\nRussian forces executed five Ukrainian prisoners of war, Ukraine\u2019s Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, said on Sunday.\n\nLubinets said on the Telegram messenger app that Russian troops shot the five unarmed soldiers after capturing them. He gave no details, but will report this fact to the UN.\n\n\u201cRussian war criminals who shoot Ukrainian prisoners of war should be brought before an international tribunal and punished with the most severe punishment provided for by law,\u201d Lubinets said.\n\nRussia did not immediately comment on the incident, but has previous denied committing war crimes.\n\nPutin holds talks with Slovakian PM Fico\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 03:02 , Namita Singh\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin yesterday hosted Slovakia\u2019s prime minister, Robert Fico, in a rare visit to the Kremlin by an EU leader since Moscow\u2019s all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nMr Fico arrived in Russia on a \u201cworking visit\u201d and met with Mr Putin one-on-one on yesterday evening, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russia\u2019s RIA news agency.\n\nAccording to Mr Peskov, the talks were expected to focus on \u201cthe international situation\u201d and Russian natural gas deliveries.\n\nRussian natural gas still flows to some European countries, including Slovakia, through Ukraine under a five-year agreement signed before the war that is due to expire at the end of this year.\n\nAt a summit in Brussels on Thursday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky told EU leaders that Kyiv has no intention of renewing the deal, something Mr Fico insisted will harm his country\u2019s interests.\n\nRussian oil refinery engulfed in flames after \u2018Ukrainian drone strike\u2019\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 02:00 , Holly Evans\n\nRussian oil refinery engulfed in flames after \u2018Ukrainian drone strike\u2019"

This week Berlin city government approved cuts of up to \u00a3108 million from its cultural budget for 2025 despite weeks of protest against the proposed measures. The plans have received vocal opposition from artists, museum leaders, and cultural organisations who fear that the sector could be set for venue closures and a hit to the city\u2019s cultural standing. The cuts represent a 12% cut on the previous year and has sparked fears that the city could lose its status as one of Europe\u2019s foremost cultural capitals.\n\nEmma Enderby, the director of the non-profit KW Institute for Contemporary Art, told The Art Newspaper: \u201cCulture and clubs bring people to Berlin. They don\u2019t come here for the food, they come here for the history and the culture.\n\nThe city has for years been considered as one of Europe's foremost cultural capitals\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very short notice, it also seems very short sighted. \u201cIn Berlin, culture costs around 2% of the overall economy, yet they\u2019re cutting us between around 10% and in some cases 50%. Enderby says that her museum is already feeling the impact of the cuts with the museum has decided not to renew staff contracts and to scale back upcoming programs, including public engagement initiatives. Philip Br\u00f6king, co-director of Berlin's Komische Oper opera house is also preparing for a painful 2025. He told Euronews Culture: \u201cIf that budget is cut, we face a double blow: fewer subsidies and less funding to cover extra costs. This makes us very sceptical about the future of our institution.\u201d\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "The more powerful the PC, the more heat it typically generates. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so impressive to see a silent mini gaming PC such as this new Cirrus7 machine, which has absolutely no fans. Cirrus7, a specialist German PC manufacturer, has been shipping the passively cooled Cirrus7 Incus since 2019, but it\u2019s now just announced a refresh to its lineup, with new CPUs from Intel and AMD from which to choose, including the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X.\n\nAs our Geekom AX8 Pro review showed, keeping a high-spec PC cool in such a small space can be tricky, usually relying on high-spinning fans to get the job done. The Cirrus 7 Incus, meanwhile, instead uses a special aluminum case to spread the heat away from the Intel or AMD CPU in use, keeping the PC silent in the process.\n\nThis highly powerful mini PC is available in several different configurations, but the new refresh allows you to choose between 14th-gen Intel Raptor Lake CPUs, such as the Intel Core i9 14900T, or brand-new AMD Ryzen 9000 series CPUs, such as the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X. The build itself uses a custom Mini-STX motherboard, with three different case designs that use metal cooling fins to help remove the heat.\n\nYou can choose your own storage, RAM, and built-in wireless connection options, as well as your preferred operating system. For a gaming build, a good configuration would be to choose an AM5 CPU such as the AMD Ryzen 7 8700G, which uses the same AMD Radeon 780M integrated GPU found in a gaming handheld such as the Asus ROG Ally X, which is capable of handling 1080p gameplay at modest settings.\n\nCombine that with 16GB RAM and a good-sized 1TB M.2 SSD for storage, using the bigger extended cooling case design, and this Cirrus 7 Incus PC will cost nearly $1,100. While that might seem expensive, this mini PC\u2019s whole design is focused on having zero fans, meaning that it\u2019s completely silent, or as close to silent as any electronic device can be.\n\nIf you\u2019re sick of fan noise ruining the immersion during your gameplay sessions, a totally fanless, passively cooled setup such as this Cirrus7 Incus machine would be a good alternative. You can check out this mini PC for yourself by visiting the Cirrus7 website using this link here, where you can test out building your own custom configuration. The German manufacturer does ship internationally, but you\u2019ll need to confirm with the company first about shipping outside of the EU.\n\nThis looks to be a great fanless mini PC, but if you\u2019re looking for more gaming power, check out our best mini gaming PC guide, where we take you through a number of options, some of which even include full-size graphics cards."

The ROG Strix X870-I Gaming Wifi and Ayaneo Flip DS, to name just two, are easy recommendations. But neither could have earned my recommendation come September. That was when I first got my hands on the Havn HS 420.\n\nChoosing the right chassis is a crucial part of PC building. Choose the wrong one and prepare to come away from the experience with bleeding hands and a vow to buy a prebuilt next time. But make the right call, and you'll want to stare at the majesty of your PC for hours.\n\nThe Havn HS 420 is the right call.\n\nHavn is a new name in the space\u2014the HS 420 is the first product released by the brand\u2014but it's born out of Pro Gamers Group, who also own a few of the big european tech retailers and keyboard manufacturer Ducky.\n\nBro, this chassis is fire\u2014is what I imagine someone on TikTok has said about the HS 420 at some point. It's inarguably eye-catching, too. I caught sight of it from across the showfloor at Computex, where it was first unveiled, and immediately bolted over to see it. It was on a gradually rotating plinth, and I took a good few snaps of it and made a note to return for a chat about it before scuttling off to my next appointment.\n\nLet's talk about the chassis itself, then.\n\nThe vented side and top panels are a particular highlight. They look stunning but they serve a purpose\u2014this chassis offers a variety of ways to install fans and/or radiators. That includes down the side of the motherboard tray, above the motherboard, beneath the motherboard, to the other side of the motherboard\u2014all around the motherboard, really.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nThe HS 420 aims to keep airflow moving across your CPU and motherboard and keep hot air erupting from your GPU from sticking around too long. To that end, the VGPU version\u2014which includes a PCIe 5.0 riser and bracket for mounting your graphics card on its side\u2014also includes a glass separator to help ease the airflow within the case. I didn't find it made much of a difference to be honest, but it looks good, and my temps were decent in testing.\n\nI do have a few problems with it that it's only fair to note here. Firstly, it doesn't come with any fans, which on top of the cost of the chassis itself, starting at $199 for the non-VGPU version, means it won't be winning any awards for being affordable. Though I'd argue it's still a great investment if you plan to keep this chassis for any considerable length of time.\n\nIt also weighs 19 kg. With a side panel that wraps around the front and is made entirely of glass, I can see why. But that weight does make it unwieldly. What you don't want to happen is unkowingly pick it up by the dust filter and have said dust filter pull away from the case, sending the chassis into a rapid descent towards the concrete floor. And all happening just moments before you're supposed to shoot it for a feature your popular magazine, which is on deadline. Not that this exact thing ever happened to me, but if it did I would have caught it with the help of our photographer and only slightly injured myself in the process.\n\nImage 1 of 4 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nYou might still be thinking 'a case is a case is a case'. I strongly disagree. The HS 420 might look like an empty vessel that serves no purpose until it's filled with a multitude of other components, but it's the cleanest, most builder-friendly chassis I've used in quite some time. Heck, maybe ever.\n\nThe wide and deep cable management on the rear of the motherboard tray is a good example of its excellence, which makes for easy work of genuinely good-looking cable management without a degree from cable management school (which I don't have). All over the case there are signs of design for convenience\u2014the way the intake and exhaust fan mounts remove, or the dust filters, or the single screw that holds the lower fan mount in place\u2026 each little piece removes some small hassle or inconvenience from the building process.\n\nWhat's most surprising, however, is just how expertly designed this chassis is considering it's the first ever product from Havn. Sure, the people behind it aren't complete newbs [sic], but to nail a design that works for both beginners and experienced builders alike\u2014well, it's just darned impressive.\n\nI came away from building in the Havn HS 420 feeling like I'd nailed it. Realistically, I had only put a few white parts together and called it a PC build. The Havn HS 420 was, and continues to be, the true star of the show.\n\nIf you want to find out who won the PC Gamer Hardware Awards, we'll be publishing the winners on New Year's Day."

the legendary structure is believed to be the saviour and shield of the people in Tampico, Mexico.\n\n8 A mock-up of what the underwater base 'Amupac' could look like Credit: Alamy\n\n8 A sign in Tampico is heavily decorated with aliens to represent the city's belief in extra terrestrial life Credit: playamiramarmx\n\n8 Many shops, bars and restaurants use aliens for decor to attract loyal customers Credit: BBC MUNDO\n\n8 A UFO seen hovering near the secret 'alien base' in Mexico Credit: X/@covertress\n\nAlien believers claim the mythical base - which is said to sometimes spawn UFOs - has led to them avoiding trouble for 57 years.\n\nAccording to locals, there hasn't been a hurricane in the region since 1967 - something they say is due to aliens living in Amupac.\n\nThe wacky legend describes the underwater wonder as an \u201cintraterrestrial\u201d and \u201cmultidimensional\u201d secret zone invisible to the human eye.\n\nSelf-proclaimed alien investigators in Mexico have drawn up a theory saying a group of 10ft, thin and light-skinned aliens have built up the base off Miramar Beach.\n\nThey claim a series of metre-long aluminium, iron and copper alloy bars have been secretly buried in the seafloor when the beings first visited.\n\nJuan Carlos Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez D\u00edaz, president of the Association of Scientific Research on UFOs in Tamaulipas (AICOT), has been leading the legend for decades.\n\nHe claims to have visited the alien base during an astral trip through mediation and believes it has been made in Tampico to protect the locals.\n\nThe idea of the alien base lurking beneath the water first came from local news outlet El Sol de Tampico newspaper in 1967.\n\nThey ran a sensational story headlined \"Platillos Voladores Sobre Tampico\" - translated to English as \"Flying Saucers Over Tampico\".\n\nIt quoted local cops as saying they witnessed \"nine unidentified objects\" in the sky moments before a terrifying hurricane was due to hit.\n\nThe paper added that \"thousands of inhabitants' saw objects in the sky\" as the natural disaster remarkably bypassed the city.\n\nMy grandad was at the Roswell UFO crash & he told us ALIEN bodies were found\n\nPrior to 1967, the region was known as a hotbed of hurricane and tropical storms.\n\nOnly a year earlier Hurricane Inez left 74 people dead as four other major storms ripped through Tampico and nearby Ciudad Madero across three decades between 1933 and 1966.\n\nBut ever since the alien sightings not a single weather phenomenon has attacked the region.\n\nIn 1988, a hurricane due to smash the city - but it suddenly changed direction and hit further up the coast.\n\nAll natural disasters have disappeared from weather radars in the area when passing through the Gulf Coast.\n\nMost recently, devastating Tropical Storm Karl was all but set to strike on the shoreline in 2013 after terrorising the neighbouring towns and villages.\n\nBut at the last moment, radars showed the cyclone taking a sharp turn and completely skipping over the area.\n\nA 71-year-old local called Beatriz Garc\u00eda said that during the build up to the storm, her and most of the neighbours had their feet up despite the constant red weather warnings.\n\nShe told Vice: \u201cI immediately said they [aliens] are going to protect us.\u2019\n\n\"And this is what I believe and trust - that they exist, that there is a base.\"\n\n8 Tampico was left badly damaged by Hurricane Janet in the 1950s but has been spared from several natural disasters ever since Credit: Alamy\n\n8 Self-proclaimed alien investigators say a group of 10ft, thin and light-skinned aliens built up the base off the Miramar Beach in Tampico, Mexico Credit: Getty - Contributor\n\nThe brutal weather found its way back in line with the weather radar and continued ravaging the Gulf Coast of Mexico.\n\nAnd this streak of good fortune has meant the legend of Amupac has quickly grown into a widely accepted belief by locals.\n\nThey claim the extraterrestrial beings have developed a device capable of using magnetic fields to fend off weather phenomenons.\n\nThis layer of protective tech has kept the area protected ever since 1967, they claim.\n\nDr Rosario Romero, a climate scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, has been baffled by the long-lasting streak of good weather in the area.\n\nBut she quickly shot down the idea of aliens manipulating the region.\n\nShe said ever-changing weather was more likely to be a reason for the spate of luck.\n\nI immediately said 'they [aliens] are going to protect us.\u2019 And this is what I believe and trust: that they exist, that there is a base Beatriz Garc\u00eda\n\nPrevailing westerly winds and high pressure subtropical systems are said to drive away hurricanes and push them towards the southern coast of the US.\n\nDr Romero said people have chosen to forget about serious flooding in 2013 in Tampico.\n\nAnd earlier this year, Tropical Storm Alberto also affected Tampico.\n\nIt reached 50mph as it made landfall near the region.\n\nBut it was described as weak and left Tampico virtually unscathed.\n\nDespite experts continuing to discredit any unworldly explanation for steak of good luck, most of the Tampico locals have are convinced of their protectors.\n\nOutsiders who view the idea of alien security as a wacky and far fetched dream are soon left questioning their stance once they step foot in the city.\n\nDozens of restaurants and shops in the region have taken inspiration from Amupac to suit the beliefs of the alien-loving people.\n\nThey sell extraterrestrial-themed stuffed toys and memorabilia from green earrings to eerie, illuminated postcards.\n\nLots of the local brands and eateries have even picked up martians as their chosen mascots to entice in visitors.\n\nThe nearby beach where the alien base is said to be has been dubbed \"Playa Protegida\" - the \"Protected Beach\".\n\nTampico's municipal government has even used the theory to launch an annual event.\n\nThe last Tuesday in October is celebrated as the \"Day of the Martian\" where locals gather at the beach to thank the aliens for their protection.\n\nIf science doesn't give us any explanation, we'll get it by magic. Fantasy is always more attractive than reality Marco Flores\n\nTampico historian Marco Flores thinks many locals are well aware of the legend being improbable - but they want something to believe in.\n\nHe told The Guardian: \"If science doesn't give us any explanation, we'll get it by magic.\n\n\"Fantasy is always more attractive than reality.\"\n\nIt comes as locals in Tapico have also claimed to have spotted saucer-shaped UFOs hovering above the supposed alien base back in 2023.\n\nUnexplainable images shared by a crew member onboard an oil rig near the city show a number of strange objects in the sky.\n\nOne shows a small aircraft with glowing lights at the bottom of it soaring in the sky.\n\nAt least six amber lights can be seen underneath the potential spaceship that is also surrounded by a silver disc.\n\nAnother picture shows three illuminated dots in the air making up a peculiar triangle shape.\n\nBoth crafts are believed to have suddenly appeared before quickly jetting off and never returning.\n\n8 The alien base is said to sit underwater off Miramar Beach Credit: AFP"

            "article_content": "Dallas County, April 1897\n\n\n\nNewspapers of the day reported the sightings straight-faced, although one can read more than a little tongue-in-cheek writing into some of the dispatches from community correspondents.\n\n\n\nDescriptions of the airships varied somewhat, but there was a general consensus that they had cigar-shaped bodies or cabins 50 to 60 feet long with propellers at each end, large bat-like wings, and huge floodlights fore and aft. Most witnesses saw neither pilot nor crew, but in some cases, not only did observers see people manning the ships, but talked to them. The Dallas Morning News' correspondent at Waxahachie reported a long conversation between Judge Love of the community and an airship crew, which claimed to be from the North Pole.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Field, 1952\n\n\n\nThere was considerable air traffic in the vicinity (normal Love Field activity) and there was enough light that aircraft were identifiable as the general type when viewed in the southwest, the sun to the rear. I first noticed an orange colored light which appeared to be nothing more than the exhaust or running light of an aircraft. Then, I noticed the light gave off an exhaust trail similar to that of an afterburner. I watched the light in its descending path for about four seconds when it seemed to fire a number of \"rockets\" and vanished.\n\n\n\nUniversity Park, 1961\n\n\n\nAt exactly 4:07 AM CST early Thursday morning, March 9th, I was out in my back yard doing a bit of amateur satelloon watching [a balloon satellite] ....hoping to see the polka-dot 12 footer, and I SAW A BIG, extremely fast, unidentified object streaking from about ENE to SW across the sky. It moved so fast was hard to focus on it, but I DO remember quite a bit of the impression it left on me. This object, seemingly, moved so darn fast that I would never have given it much later thought, except that the 7:00 AM news that morning carried big story that the Russians had orbited a dog, etc. in a 5-ton rocket.\n\nDenton, 2007\n\n\n\nI think I saw a UFO. I am not really sure. I feel like I am kind of crazy for thinking this. I was driving on 35W in Denton, TX around 10:15 a.m. 11/21/07 this morning and when I came over a hill I saw three white things in the sky. It was like 1 mile in front of me, slightly to the right. I wasn't sure if it was the balls that are on powerline to warn airplanes and then I thought it was a reflection the stadium. the balls were white with some silver tint. They were almost a perfect circle, but a little oblong.\n\n\n\nThey were perfectly aligned in a row a little to the left of me looking straight ahead. I was thinking I should take a picture because I thought oh it might be a UFO. I was trying to figure out what it was and the one on the right disapeared and one second later the middle one dissapeared and a little less then one second later the left one dissapeared. It didn't fade out or dart away. It just dissapeared in a split second.\n\n\n\nI am super freaked out right now and I don't know if It was something from Carswell air base or Lockead Martin, but I have NEVER seen anything like this before. It was soooo clear too. Not fuzy at all! PLease let me know if anyone else has seen this one in Denton! I have been very skeptical of UFO sightings, but I am so freaked out and paranoid now!\n\n\n\nIrving, 2021\n\n\n\nThe shiny spinning disc was seen hovering over a golf course before it appeared to have landed on the ground in Irving on April 25.\n\n\n\nFootage was recorded by a man who was visiting the area with his friends. They then saw the strange object reflecting the sunlight from a distance.\n\n\n\nA man was heard saying in the background: \u2018You see that? That\u2019s not a weather balloon, dude, it\u2019s flat.\n\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s moving really weird, it\u2019s like spinning and it\u2019s got another disc inside of it that\u2019s spinning.\u2019\n\n\n\nHe described the object as a \u2018large metallic ring that floated around a separate metallic sphere within the ring, like a flying armillary sphere.\u2019\n\nPilots flying near Dallas Fort Worth International Airport recently reported some suspicious lights floating around that air traffic controllers couldn't spot with their technology. It provoked quite the conversation.Seems UFO sightings is a topic that may never go out of style, especially in North Texas. In fact, a recent study names Texas as one of the top hotspots for UFO sightings in the U.S. Some of the more talked-about UFO sightings in the nation\u2019s history have occurred in other parts of Texas like Levelland, Lubbock and Dayton, for example.It got us to thinking about North Texas\u2019 history with UFO sightings. In case you aren\u2019t aware, it\u2019s neithera rare nor recent phenomenon. This is by no means a comprehensive compendium of North Texas UFO sightings, but here are some of the accounts that stuck out the most to us.UFO sightings in North Texas were all the rage back when ol\u2019 Charles Culberson served as the state\u2019s 21st governor, just 30-plus years removed from the Civil War. According to the Texas Almanac , \u201cbetween April 13 and 17, 1897, there were 38 reported sightings of \u2018airships\u2019 in 23 counties in Texas, including in Denton and Dallas Counties.\"In 2015, the published an article looking at the Dallas UFO sightings mentioned in Project Blue Book, a federal program that subjected reports of UFO sightings to certain scientific analysis. This sighting noted in Project Blue Book caught our eye.Another local example logged in Project Blue Book was intriguing to us. One man who reported a UFO sighting was indeed looking to the sky for something unique, but not for what he says he found.Did you know there\u2019s a National UFO Reporting Center? The center has a website where folks can log their sightings. This account from Denton, reprinted as it appeared, caught our attention, as we could relate to feeling more than a little perplexed at what we think we may have just seen.Look, not all UFO sightings are created equal. Not all accounts are going to get the public all riled up. But here\u2019s one from Irving from only three years ago , and it includes the term \u201c armillary sphere ,\u201d for which we give props. It's a wonderfully on-point description of what we think an alien spacecraft may look like. Plus, there\u2019s a video of it, posted to a website called Newsflare."

            "article_content": "A viral video of \u201cUFOs\u201d over Maryland is light-years from the truth. It\u2019s an artificial intelligence creation inspired by the mysterious drone sightings.\n\nReports of drones flying over New Jersey and other parts of the eastern U.S. have some wondering if the drones are actually unidentified flying objects (UFOs).\n\nAn Instagram post with more than 200,000 likes claims to show a video of \u201cUFOs over Maryland.\u201d An X post with over 690,000 views that shows the same video says \u201cMore #UFOs spotted in Maryland \u2026 What are these drones doing in US airspace.\u201d\n\nBut some commenters questioned whether the video was real.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nIs the video claiming to show UFOs over Maryland real?\n\nTHE SOURCES\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nNo, the video claiming to show UFOs over Maryland isn\u2019t real. The video was made with artificial intelligence.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nThe video does not show real UFOs or even drones flying over a Maryland neighborhood. It was made using artificial intelligence. The creator of the video said he was inspired to create it by the lack of information provided by the government about drones.\n\nUsing InVid, a video forensics tool, VERIFY analyzed the video and conducted a reverse image search of each frame. The original video featuring the text \u201cNow they are over Maryland!\u201d, was posted to TikTok by Joey Malinski, a digital content creator, on Dec. 13.\n\nMalinski is the director of Maryland-based digital company ATB Productions. He took credit for the viral clip on both his TikTok and YouTube channels and also described how he made the video clip using Sora, an AI creation tool, to design the clip.\n\n\u201cWith my clip, obviously, the government hasn't been telling us about what these drones are. I've been a believer in aliens since I got visited in 2017. To me, I wanted to create something that was inspired by the original fake news. You know, UFO sightings and Bat Boy in the cave. Now we have me on a cell phone, shooting AI video of stuff that's plausible. Because the plausibility is why it's believable,\u201d Malinski says in the video.\n\nTo achieve the \u201cplausibility\u201d effect, he told VERIFY he chose to mimic existing drone videos circulating online, opting for a \u201chandheld, shot-on-a-cellphone\u201d style to make it appear authentic, while simultaneously incorporating elements that made it intentionally fake.\n\n\u201cI included the traditional \u2018circular\u2019 UFO design, flashing lights, and added the X-Files theme music to enhance the darkness and humor of the concept,\u201d Malinski explained.\n\nHe said he thought adding the music would be a giveaway that the video was fake, but the clearest indicator the video was AI-generated is how the lights reflect on the trees, a detail where AI \u201cstill struggles with realism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis video was an example of how surprisingly easy it is to make something look \u2018real,\u2019\u201d Malinski said.\n\nPentagon Press Secretary John Kirby has explained that the drone sightings include a mix of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even misidentified stars. Senior officials from the FBI, Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have stated the drones don\u2019t pose a national security threat, safety risk, or connection to foreign actors."

            "article_content": "Over the last decade or so, quantum computing has become the talk of computer town. Their potential to solve complex problems much faster than classical computers is an intriguing proposition that could benefit, if not transform, several industries.\n\nThe working of a quantum computer is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, an area of physics that deals with the smallest particles in the universe.\n\nPhysicist Richard Feynman proposed the idea of developing a computer to simulate quantum systems in 1982. He discussed the idea of a universal computer that could simulate all physics \u2014 both quantum and classical. Researchers realised classical computers, the computers of today, would struggle with the complexity of quantum systems and thus the idea of a quantum computer was born.\n\nSince then, scientists have made significant progress in quantum computing.\n\nBasics of quantum computing\n\nClassical computers work on the principles of classical physics. Their fundamental computing unit is the bit: each bit represents one piece of information with two possible values, 0 or 1. It is possible to represent all types of information as a combination of 0s and 1s using the binary system.\n\nQuantum computers rely on quantum bits or qubits to perform computations. Unlike classical bits, qubits can exist in the states 0, 1 or in a state that\u2019s partly 0 and partly 1. In this context, state refers to all the possible values the qubit can have.\n\nThe ability of qubits to be in two states is known as superposition. Superposition is one of two fundamental principles that animate quantum computers.\n\nImagine a spinning coin. While the coin is spinning, it can be both heads or tails, and it isn\u2019t until the coin collapses that you can see which it is. A qubit is like a spinning coin that holds both values simultaneously.\n\nWhen a qubit is measured, it collapses to one of the values, 0 or 1. This means while a classical bit holds one unit of information, a qubit can hold two. Because of this quantum computers can perform multiple computations simultaneously, with the measurement revealing one of the possible outcomes of the computations.\n\nThe second fundamental principle upon which quantum computers are based is called entanglement. This phenomenon allows qubits to be intrinsically linked no matter how far apart they physically are. Albert Einstein famously called it \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d.\n\nSo measuring the state of one of the qubits could immediately yield information about the state of the other. Say you have a pair of gloves. Each glove is put in a separate box and sent to different locations, and we don\u2019t know which box has which. But once a box is opened to reveal the left glove, we instantly know the other box has the right glove.\n\nThe instantaneous correlation between qubits allows shared information to be processed simultaneously, speeding up computations that would take far longer with classical computers.\n\nSuperposition and entanglement can\u2019t be described by classical theories of physics. They are exclusive to quantum mechanics \u2014 and central to the potential that quantum computers have to offer.\n\nSignificant milestones\n\nQuantum computers are technologically superior but this doesn\u2019t automatically mean they will be better than classical computers at different tasks.\n\nOver the years, experts have developed and honed specific tasks that prove quantum computers are capable of greater feats, and also show how.\n\nIn 1994, Bell Labs computer scientist Peter Shor created the famous Shor\u2019s algorithm. The algorithm could factorise (or find the factors of) large numbers in moments rather than the millions of years required by classical computers.\n\nThis has major implications for data security. Current methods to secure data involve locking the data and hiding the key to unlock it in the solution of a difficult mathematical problem.\n\nLarge-number factorisation is one such problem and classical computers require enormous amounts of resources to solve it. But using Shor\u2019s algorithm, a quantum computer could quickly solve the problem and open the locks.\n\nThe state of quantum computing came a long way in the next 25 years. In 2019, for example, IBM unveiled the world\u2019s first circuit-based commercial quantum computer Q System One. Circuit-based designs are believed to be the most versatile for general quantum-computing applications.\n\nQ System One uses quantum circuits composed of quantum gates that manipulate qubits, analogous to how classical computers use logic gates.\n\nIn the same year, researchers at Google reported in a paper in Nature that their 53-qubit \u2018Sycamore\u2019 processor had achieved quantum supremacy.\n\nA quantum computer achieves quantum supremacy when it can solve a problem that would take classical computers an unreasonable amount of time. The paper claimed Sycamore completed a task in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer 10,000 years.\n\nEarlier this month, in fact, Google unveiled a quantum chip called Willow, purportedly the world\u2019s first quantum processor in which error-corrected qubits improve as they scale.\n\nQuantum states are easily prone to errors due to interactions with the environment. Quantum computers need error correction to hold information long enough to perform useful calculations with them.\n\nWillow, Google has said, can finish a standard test in five minutes whereas the same calculation would take today\u2019s best supercomputers 10 trillion trillion years.\n\nPresent limitations\n\nThe advancements are flying thick and fast but there are still many significant challenges to overcome before quantum computers can become (relatively) common.\n\nThe chief concern is that building quantum computers remains expensive and complex. Keeping many qubits stable is also difficult because of error rates and decoherence (when a qubit loses superposition because of noise from its surroundings).\n\nThe problems for which we really need quantum computers \u2014 like discovering new drugs or cracking mysteries in astronomy \u2014 also require millions of qubits.\n\nAll said, their potential to be useful is clear. This is why India launched the National Quantum Mission in 2023. The government has set aside \u20b96,000 crore for the mission to be spent over eight years, among other things to develop quantum computers.\n\nTejasri Gururaj is a freelance science writer and journalist with a master\u2019s degree in physics"

Found in the Batagaika crater, the ancient creature offers valuable insights into prehistoric life, while climate change accelerates the permafrost's retreat.\n\nMeanwhile, on a different frontier of technology, South Korean scientists have unveiled an 'Iron Man' inspired exoskeleton robot. This lightweight, wearable device aids paraplegics by locking onto the user's body, helping them navigate stairs and obstacles, marking a leap forward in assistive technology.\n\nIn the realm of space exploration, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) has attracted 30 companies for a pioneering initiative to establish home-grown satellite constellations. This effort aims to bolster India's defense and infrastructure capabilities by reducing dependency on foreign data.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

Gilchrist, Republican of Maryland and chairman of the Subcommittee on Buildings and Grounds, said at a hearing in October 1995. \u201cWhile this building is not large, it represents one of a series of actions undertaken by the legislative branch to reduce its size and scope.\u201d\n\nThree decades later, that building is still controlled by Congress, sitting dark and empty as a monument to how hard it can be to impose significant change on the sprawling federal government. In the hallways of Washington, grand plans like the ones President-elect Donald J. Trump and allies like the billionaire Elon Musk are espousing about abolishing federal agencies and drastically cutting spending have a way of encountering political reality."
