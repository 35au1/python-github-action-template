UK\u2019s most famous UFO sighting could finally be solved 45 years on \u2013 as expert reveals \u2018electromagnetic PLASMA\u2019 theory\n\nTHE UK's most famous UFO sighting could finally be solved 45 years on - as an expert revealed a new \"electromagnetic plasma\" theory.\n\nMystery lights spotted by SAS troopers in December 1980 could have been down to a \"mass psychosis\" caused by \"electromagnetic plasma\" coming from the earth, they revealed.\n\n3 The mystery lights are believed to be down to a 'mass psychosis'. Pictured, a sculpture now at the site Credit: Alamy\n\n3 The Rendlesham Forest UFO incident information board Credit: Alamy\n\n3 The plasma theory was first put forward by Dr Ron Haddow Credit: Alamy\n\nMany high ranking officers from the US Air Force personnel reported seeing a triangular alien craft in Rendlesham Forest, a remote part of Suffolk.\n\nOne even claimed to have got close enough to touch a \"triangular spacecraft\".\n\nBut despite multiple investigations into the sighting no explanation for the glowing scenes was ever found.\n\nPhilip Mantle, an expert in UFO sightings, has revealed he may know what really happened that night.\n\n\"If you look at what those involved said to begin with, the only concrete info was that they saw strange lights in the forest - that's what we start with,\" he told Metro.\n\nThe plasma theory was first put forward by Dr Ron Haddow.\n\nPhillip said: \"He was concerned this plasma emitted a type of electromagnetic energy, which could interfere with aircraft communications of cause cognitive impairment.\"\n\nBritish UFO expert Albert Budden later showed that the Earth produces electromagnetic forces which can emit light - otherwise called the plasma.\n\nPhillip added: \"Some people can be hypersensitive to these lights - in other words allergic - and can have the most bizarre experience you'll think is absolutely real.\n\n\"It could be these soldiers came into contact with it and all hallucinated.\"\n\nHe also discounted old theories, which suggested SAS troops staged the sighting as revenge on US troops, saying \"pranking\" would not have taken place in the heat of the Cold War.\n\nThe theory was upheld by UFO enthusiast Dr David Clarke who said, \"lights and coloured flares were rigged in the woods and black helium balloons were coupled to remote-controlled kites.\"\n\nBut like Phillip, former Ministry of Defence UFO investigator Nick Pope, told the Sun Online he was sceptical of such claims.\n\nNasa discovers mysterious green spots on Mars that could be signs of ancient alien life Despite its nickname of 'the Red Planet', mysterious green dots have been discovered in the sand on Mars. Nasa's Perseverance rover, which has been navigating Mars for nearly four years, stumbled upon the new mystery in a region called \"Serpentine Rapids\". After scraping away the top layer of regolith in a red rock outcrop named \"Wallace Butte\", the rover uncovered a \"striking\" array of colours within the rock, Nasa wrote. Colours of white, black and even green were discovered. \"One of the biggest surprises for the rover team was the presence of the drab-green-colored spots within the abrasion patch, which are composed of dark-toned cores with fuzzy, light green rims,\" Nasa added. The green patches can also be found on Earth's so-called 'red beds' - areas of sediment where water, carrying iron, has filtered through, and eventually hardens into rock.\n\nHe told the Sun Online: \"It's classic friend-of-a-friend stuff: a ufologist claims he was contacted by a former SAS soldier, who claims he was involved in a prank.\n\n\"Frankly, there's no evidence such a prank even occurred, let alone that it played a role in the infamous Rendlesham Forest incident.\n\n\"Having undertaken a cold case review of this incident for the MoD, I can confirm that the events in Rendlesham Forest 40 years ago remain unexplained.\n\nThe US airman Jim Penniston's claim that he touched the aircraft is also dubious, according Philip, who said his account changed over time.\n\nHe said: \"Jim underwent hypnosis a few years back and said the craft was a machine from the futures.\"\n\nHe admitted however that the plasma theory could also be an incorrect assumption as UFO researchers all \"suffer confirmation bias\".\n\nHe added: \"But I'm sure Rendlesham's legend will only continue to grow in the years ahead.\""

            "article_content": "As you scroll through your social media feed or let your favorite music app curate the perfect playlist, it may feel like artificial intelligence is improving your life \u2013 learning your preferences and serving your needs. But lurking behind this convenient facade is a growing concern: algorithmic harms.\n\nThese harms aren\u2019t obvious or immediate. They\u2019re insidious, building over time as AI systems quietly make decisions about your life without you even knowing it. The hidden power of these systems is becoming a significant threat to privacy, equality, autonomy and safety.\n\nAI systems are embedded in nearly every facet of modern life. They suggest what shows and movies you should watch, help employers decide whom they want to hire, and even influence judges to decide who qualifies for a sentence. But what happens when these systems, often seen as neutral, begin making decisions that put certain groups at a disadvantage or, worse, cause real-world harm?\n\nThe often-overlooked consequences of AI applications call for regulatory frameworks that can keep pace with this rapidly evolving technology. I study the intersection of law and technology, and I\u2019ve outlined a legal framework to do just that.\n\nSlow burns\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of algorithmic harms is that their cumulative impact often flies under the radar. These systems typically don\u2019t directly assault your privacy or autonomy in ways you can easily perceive. They gather vast amounts of data about people \u2014 often without their knowledge \u2014 and use this data to shape decisions affecting people\u2019s lives.\n\nSometimes, this results in minor inconveniences, like an advertisement that follows you across websites. But as AI operates without addressing these repetitive harms, they can scale up, leading to significant cumulative damage across diverse groups of people.\n\nConsider the example of social media algorithms. They are ostensibly designed to promote beneficial social interactions. However, behind their seemingly beneficial facade, they silently track users\u2019 clicks and compile profiles of their political beliefs, professional affiliations and personal lives. The data collected is used in systems that make consequential decisions \u2014 whether you are identified as a jaywalking pedestrian, considered for a job or flagged as a risk to commit suicide.\n\nWorse, their addictive design traps teenagers in cycles of overuse, leading to escalating mental health crises, including anxiety, depression and self-harm. By the time you grasp the full scope, it\u2019s too late \u2014 your privacy has been breached, your opportunities shaped by biased algorithms, and the safety of the most vulnerable undermined, all without your knowledge.\n\nThis is what I call \u201cintangible, cumulative harm\u201d: AI systems operate in the background, but their impacts can be devastating and invisible.\n\nWhy regulation lags behind\n\nDespite these mounting dangers, legal frameworks worldwide have struggled to keep up. In the United States, a regulatory approach emphasizing innovation has made it difficult to impose strict standards on how these systems are used across multiple contexts.\n\nCourts and regulatory bodies are accustomed to dealing with concrete harms, like physical injury or economic loss, but algorithmic harms are often more subtle, cumulative and hard to detect. The regulations often fail to address the broader effects that AI systems can have over time.\n\nSocial media algorithms, for example, can gradually erode users\u2019 mental health, but because these harms build slowly, they are difficult to address within the confines of current legal standards.\n\nFour types of algorithmic harm\n\nDrawing on existing AI and data governance scholarship, I have categorized algorithmic harms into four legal areas: privacy, autonomy, equality and safety. Each of these domains is vulnerable to the subtle yet often unchecked power of AI systems.\n\nThe first type of harm is eroding privacy. AI systems collect, process and transfer vast amounts of data, eroding people\u2019s privacy in ways that may not be immediately obvious but have long-term implications. For example, facial recognition systems can track people in public and private spaces, effectively turning mass surveillance into the norm.\n\nThe second type of harm is undermining autonomy. AI systems often subtly undermine your ability to make autonomous decisions by manipulating the information you see. Social media platforms use algorithms to show users content that maximizes a third party\u2019s interests, subtly shaping opinions, decisions and behaviors across millions of users.\n\nThe third type of harm is diminishing equality. AI systems, while designed to be neutral, often inherit the biases present in their data and algorithms. This reinforces societal inequalities over time. In one infamous case, a facial recognition system used by retail stores to detect shoplifters disproportionately misidentified women and people of color.\n\nThe fourth type of harm is impairing safety. AI systems make decisions that affect people\u2019s safety and well-being. When these systems fail, the consequences can be catastrophic. But even when they function as designed, they can still cause harm, such as social media algorithms\u2019 cumulative effects on teenagers\u2019 mental health.\n\nBecause these cumulative harms often arise from AI applications protected by trade secret laws, victims have no way to detect or trace the harm. This creates a gap in accountability. When a biased hiring decision or a wrongful arrest is made due to an algorithm, how does the victim know? Without transparency, it\u2019s nearly impossible to hold companies accountable.\n\nClosing the accountability gap\n\nCategorizing the types of algorithmic harms delineates the legal boundaries of AI regulation and presents possible legal reforms to bridge this accountability gap. Changes I believe would help include mandatory algorithmic impact assessments that require companies to document and address the immediate and cumulative harms of an AI application to privacy, autonomy, equality and safety \u2013 before and after it\u2019s deployed. For instance, firms using facial recognition systems would need to evaluate these systems\u2019 impacts throughout their life cycle.\n\nAnother helpful change would be stronger individual rights around the use of AI systems, allowing people to opt out of harmful practices and making certain AI applications opt in. For example, requiring an opt-in regime for data processing by firms\u2019 use of facial recognition systems and allowing users to opt out at any time.\n\nLastly, I suggest requiring companies to disclose the use of AI technology and its anticipated harms. To illustrate, this may include notifying customers about the use of facial recognition systems and the anticipated harms across the domains outlined in the typology.\n\nAs AI systems become more widely used in critical societal functions \u2013 from health care to education and employment \u2013 the need to regulate harms they can cause becomes more pressing. Without intervention, these invisible harms are likely to continue to accumulate, affecting nearly everyone and disproportionately hitting the most vulnerable.\n\nWith generative AI multiplying and exacerbating AI harms, I believe it\u2019s important for policymakers, courts, technology developers and civil society to recognize the legal harms of AI. This requires not just better laws, but a more thoughtful approach to cutting-edge AI technology \u2013 one that prioritizes civil rights and justice in the face of rapid technological advancement.\n\nThe future of AI holds incredible promise, but without the right legal frameworks, it could also entrench inequality and erode the very civil rights it is, in many cases, designed to enhance.\n\nSylvia Lu, Faculty Fellow and Visiting Assistant Professor of Law, University of Michigan\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

But did you know that a historian says nearly every property is haunted\u2026and no one seems to care?\n\nTim Graham Picture Library/Getty Images\n\nParanormal historian Richard Felix shared rare details about the British royal family in the documentary The King of UFOs, which is now streaming on Apple TV+. The expert claimed that ghost sightings and paranormal activity are normal occurrences within palace walls.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll of their properties have ghosts in them and they know it and have witnessed it,\u201d he said in the doc (according to Tatler).\n\nFelix went on to list several examples of alleged ghost sightings. \u201cThe late queen saw her namesake Queen Elizabeth in the library at Windsor Castle,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe king has seen the same ghost and his grandfather George VI saw Queen Elizabeth eight times in the library before the start of the second World War.\u201d\n\nThe historian continued, \u201cThey live with their ghosts because people do. Most people aren\u2019t afraid of ghosts when they are in their houses, they just accept them.\u201d\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHe said even Prince William knows about the ghost sightings. Last year, Felix sat down for an interview with A Right Royal Podcast and revealed that Prince William was warned about the country home he shares with wife Kate Middleton, Anmer Hall.\n\nFelix said, \u201cBefore the Waleses moved in, they were warned about the ghost and the comment was\u2014I presume it was from Prince William\u2014\u2018No old hall would be complete without a ghost, would it?\u2019\u201d\n\nI have to disagree, Prince William.\n\nWant all the latest celebrity news sent right to your inbox?

I thought it was always a full-sized poster that had been knocked over. That was my theory.\u2019\n\nCo-producer Robert Cort added: \u2018I think someone just left it there.\u2019\n\nAdditionally, Selleck later confirmed in an interview that they filmed Three Men And A Baby on a set, and not in a pre-existing building where anyone lived.\n\nHeath Ledger\u2019s reaction to the hospital explosion in The Dark Knight is real\n\nHeath Ledger\u2019s acting in this scene was even more impressive than you thought (Picture: Warner Bros/Dc Comics/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nHeath Ledger\u2019s performance as the Joker in the 2008 film The Dark Knight is legendary, with many dubbing it the definitive performance of the comic character.\n\nBut an urban legend suggested he broke character during the film\u2019s infamous hospital explosion scene and that his shocked reaction is, in fact, real.\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t true, and was yet another example of incredible acting from the late star.\n\nThe pause between the explosions and the confusion by Joker is what started the rumour, but this was planned by director Christopher Nolan to keep Ledger safe.\n\nHe said in an interview on the film\u2019s home release: \u2018[Special effects supervisor Chris Corbould] was able to come up with a scenario in which Heath could actually be walking out of the building.\n\n\u2018Because what Chris worked out is if we put in a little beat where the first set of explosions stops as if something\u2019s gone wrong, and the Joker just takes a second to look around surprised like the audience is surprised, then the major demolition comes in and he jumps straight into the school bus.\n\n\u2018In that way, he was able to come up with a practical scenario in which we could actually take a principal actor, walk him out of a building that\u2019s about to be destroyed, and literally drop the building to the ground.\u2019\n\nSusan Backlinie broke her ribs while filming Jaws\n\nNo human \u2013 or shark \u2014 was harmed in the making of this scene (Picture: Universal/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nJaws terrified audiences upon its release in 1975, but thankfully one chilling backstage tidbit didn\u2019t actually happen.\n\nOne rumour from the set of Steven Spielberg\u2019s shark horror that has persisted across decades is that Chrissie Watkins actor Susan Backlinie broke her ribs during her attack scene.\n\nHer screams of \u2018it hurts\u2019 were said to be real by some fans, adding even more terror to the sequence that opens the iconic film.\n\nBacklinie has repeatedly refuted the rumour and said she did not get hurt even one bit filming the scene, though she has opened up about the gruelling schedules the cast and crew worked at the time.\n\nOn an appearance of The Morning X with Barnes and Leslie last year, she said: \u2018We would film from anywhere from 6 to 7 in the morning till 9 because of the light. \u2026 I was home and exhausted at the end of the day.\u2019\n\nYou can see a dead munchkin in The Wizard Of Oz\n\nThat isn\u2019t what you think it is in the trees (Picture: Warner Bros)\n\nPlenty of horrifying things did surround the making of The Wizard Of Oz, but the case of the dead munchkin seems to be closed.\n\nLegend has it that in a scene of Judy Garland\u2019s Dorothy, The Scarecrow, and The Tin Man skipping along the yellow brick road, you can see a dead munchkin hanging from a tree after they allegedly took their own life.\n\nBut remastered footage of the scene makes it clear that the hanging body is actually a bird \u2013 one that the film\u2019s crew borrowed from the Los Angeles Zoo to make the forest feel more realistic.\n\nTo kill two birds with one stone (pun not intended), another rumour about the film\u2019s munchkins that has repeatedly been debunked is that they were drunk and debaucherous throughout filming.\n\nMany of the actors came out and said these rumours were untrue and harmful.\n\nThe Alien cast\u2019s reaction to the Chestburster scene is genuine\n\nA lot less mystery surrounded this iconic horror scene (Picture: 20thC.Fox/Everett/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThere is a sliver of truth to this one \u2013 but only a little.\n\nThe 1979 sci-fi horror Alien features plenty of shocking and gory scenes, but arguably none more hair-raising and stomach-turning than the Chestburster scene in which John Hurt\u2019s character Kane has one of the creatures emerge from his torso.\n\nIt was rumoured for a long time that the terrified reactions of Hurt\u2019s castmates were real as director Ridley Scott kept them in the dark about what would happen in the scene \u2013 which is partly true.\n\nThe cast did know how the scene would play out as it was included, in great detail, in their scripts.\n\nHowever, Hurt said in a 2010 talk at the Science and Media Museum that they were not prepared for how gory the scene would be.\n\nPeople who saw the first film of a moving train ran from cinemas screaming\n\nReactions to this film weren\u2019t as wild as you may believe (Picture: Lumiere/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nAuguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re were among the first people to create films, and they made history with their 1895 production L\u2019Arrivee D\u2019Un Train En Gare De La Ciotat.\n\nAs you would expect for the time it was created, it is a simple 50-second film that just shows a train arriving at a platform of people.\n\nIt is a groundbreaking piece in the history of cinema, and it became even more sensational with the story that cinemagoers were so shocked by what they saw on the big screen they ran from theatres screaming believing an actual train was coming toward them.\n\nBut there is no evidence that this ever happened \u2013 which could also make this the first-ever movie myth.\n\nBrandon Lee\u2019s death on the set of The Crow was used in the film\n\nBrandon Lee\u2019s death on the set of The Crow has been subject to wild theories (Picture: Everett/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe tragic on-set death of Brandon Lee in The Crow led many fans to speculate the film is cursed.\n\nLee, who was the son of Bruce Lee, was killed when a prop gun was accidentally loaded with a real bullet, which hit him in the abdomen and caused his death.\n\nRumours soon began after the 1994 film was released that his actual death scene was used in the film in a sequence in which his character Eric Draven is killed by the thugs who attack his girlfriend.\n\nIn actual fact, the shots of Draven\u2019s death were redone and no footage of Lee\u2019s death was used in the film.\n\nA stuntman died filming the chariot race scene in Ben Hur\n\nThis death-defying stunt didn\u2019t lead to anyone\u2019s actual death (Picture: Mgm/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe adrenaline-fuelled chariot race scene in Ben Hur is legendary more than 60 years since the 1959 film was released.\n\nBut it was tinged with sadness due to a rumour that a stuntman died during its creation.\n\nSome versions of the rumour state that the man\u2019s death can even be seen on film, but there are no records of any injuries \u2013 let alone a death \u2013 linked to the scene.\n\nHowever, the 1925 version of the film could be where the rumour stems from, a production in which a lot of stuntmen were injured and many horses involved in the film died.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by

(Photo Credits: X)\n\nResidents of Central Alberta, Canada, were surprised by the beautiful sight of light pillars. This celestial phenomenon took place at night with a temperature dropping to -30 degrees Celsius. This wonder, sometimes attributed to signs of paranormal activity, is a natural phenomenon that is familiar to meteorologists. It is formed by light reflecting under specific atmospheric conditions, which cause ice crystals to form beautiful vertical beams. In Alberta, the light pillars looked especially bright against the backdrop of a dark winter sky, mesmerising onlookers.\n\nSeveral users posted pictures of this natural wonder on social media platforms. They showcased small hexagonal ice plates in the air which reflected light from various light sources such as street lights, city lights etc.\n\nrelated stories\n\nWhat Are Light Pillars?\n\nLight pillars are columns of light that seem to rise vertically up from sources on the ground, up into the sky. In order for light pillars to appear, certain meteorological conditions must be met to the dot. For instance, sub-zero temperatures between -10 and -40. In Alberta\u2019s recent case, the temperature fell to about -30 degrees Celsius, which offered the right conditions. Apart from that, high humidity is a factor that promotes the formation of ice crystals. Light winds or the lack of winds are also considered essential to maintain the ice crystals in the air in the right stance so that the light reflects off them.\n\nThis unusual event was observed by residents of Central Alberta on November 26 and 27. Some people posted pictures and videos of the visuals on social media platforms, especially X.\n\nSharing a stunning picture, an X user wrote: \u201cCrazy!! I saw these 2 days in a row! This is a 5-shot pano taken in Lacombe, Alberta yesterday morning.\"\n\nAnother user said: \u201cLight pillar season has begun in Alberta, Canada.\"\n\nLight pillar season has begun in Alberta, Canada? Light pillars are caused by light reflecting off ice crystals suspended in the air. This phenomenon occurs in cold places where the temperature allows hexagonal ice crystals to form.

I'm looking on my end and it shows $16,' she said in a TikTok video.\n\nThe revelation came when she learned her friend was not a Prime member.\n\n'He gets a discount on the products. I have to pay additional,' she continued.\n\n'I thought my Amazon Prime membership covered the two-day shipping. But it does not. I find that to be fraudulent.'\n\nThe video, which has more than 100,000 comments, was flooded with people saying they have canceled their Prime for that reason.\n\n'I literally have been debating about canceling my Amazon Prime this is the sign I needed,' one user commented.\n\nWhile another claimed to have canceled theirs while watching the video.\n\nAmazon users are canceling their Prime memberships after discovering shopping on the platform is cheaper without the $139 service\n\nAmazon's website states that 'Prime members get free two-day shipping on millions of items, and free one-day shipping on more than 15 million items,' but some consumers have suggested that the shipping costs are baked into item prices.\n\nOne user commented on the video that shopping without Prime is cheaper because 'when you spend over $25, it's free shipping.'\n\nOther Amazon members shared frustrations about their orders not arriving within the promised two-day delivery.\n\n'Once I realized my purchases did not arrive in the time stated I canceled,' another user shared.\n\nIn the comments of LoveTheLawrences_ video, some suggest the pricing issue could be the next class action lawsuit against Amazon.\n\nAmazon was hit with a class action lawsuit this year that accused the e-commerce giant of failing to meet its stated 'guaranteed' delivery for some purchases.\n\nHowever, a Seattle judge dismissed the case in June citing that the customer had not shown how Amazon's delivery practices would violate Washington's consumer protection law.\n\nThe lawsuit said Amazon met a delivery date for a purchase but missed the four-hour window the consumer picked for their package's arrival.\n\n'It is not unfair or deceptive for Amazon to fail to abide by promises it did not make,' Evanson wrote.\n\nAmazon's website states that 'Prime members get free two-day shipping on millions of items, and free one-day shipping on more than 15 million items,' but some consumers have suggested that the shipping costs are baked into item prices\n\nBut Amazon is still facing legal troubles with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which accused the company of deceptively enrolling millions of online shoppers into the e-commerce giant's Prime service without their consent and making it hard for them to leave.\n\nThe FTC accused Amazon last year of using 'manipulative, coercive or deceptive user-interface designs known as 'dark patterns' to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically renewing Prime subscriptions.'\n\nAmazon has denied any wrongdoing in the lawsuit, which also names three of its senior executives as defendants.\n\n'The three individual defendants, whose lives have been upended by the FTC's baseless and unjust allegations, are particularly eager to see those allegations fail, and any delay further prejudices them,' Amazon said in a\n\nAmazon said in a filing last month opposing the FTC's request to push the trial back to July 2025.\n\nThe lawsuit is among several federal and state government actions challenging Amazon's business practices.\n\nThe FTC last year accused Amazon in an antitrust lawsuit of abusing its market power, in part by curbing the ability of its sellers to offer better prices on other platforms."

Black Friday tends to have the best mattress deals of the year, and starting today, you can shop some of our favorite mattresses at steep discounts so you can get better, higher quality sleep.\n\nAs a Good Housekeeping shopping editor, I regularly vet deals on a weekly basis to make sure you're getting the best prices without falling victim to some of the seedy fake deals that often pop up. And to give you the best product recommendations possible (and not just a good deal), I utilized our experts in the Good Housekeeping Institute Textiles Lab for buying advice. The crew continually tests, evaluates and compare mattresses from popular brands like Saatva, Helix and more to determine which really is the best of the best.\n\nSaatva Black Friday Sale\n\n\n\n\n\nClassic\n\nSaatva\n\n$1676.00 at saatva.com\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe deal: For this Black Friday, Good Housekeeping readers can take 20% off any of their Saatva orders (with a minimum $1,000 spend) by shopping through our exclusive link, now through November 30.\n\n\n\nWhy we love it: \u201cIt\u2019s our pick for the best overall mattress for its exceptional support and durability,\" Wu says.

Bear offers a 120-day free trial period and free shipping within the continental U.S., but you'll have to pay $100 to $175 for a setup or removal service.\n\nWhy we love it: Hybrid mattresses are a popular pick, as they bridge the comfort of foam with the support of coils. Wu says if she had to recommend just one hybrid, it would be this one. \"It's done incredibly well in our tests and won over a variety of different users,\" she shares. It's best for side and back sleepers.\n\nOur tests showed: The pressure-relieving zones throughout this top-tested mattress are designed to promote proper spine alignment and provide cushioning for the hips and back to alleviate pain.

There is even a 100-day free trial if you want to return the mattress with no strings attached.\n\n\n\nOur tests showed: Helix's Dusk Luxe mattress is a consistent fan favorite among our testers.

And our Lab pros agree.\"While mattress companies offer discounts and sales throughout the year, a holiday weekend is when you'll see the most consistent and competitive offers across brands,\" explains Textiles, Paper & Apparel Lab Product Analyst Grace Wu. Mattress brands historically choose holiday weekends like Labor Day, Memorial Day, Presidents' Day and Black Friday.\n\nExpert tips for finding Black Friday mattress deals\n\nSometimes, it's worth it to splurge. Remember: Sleep is important. Quality sleep at night can influence the course of your entire day \u2014 physically and mentally. So, it may be worth splurging a bit on a mattress that sounds right for you, but shopping during Black Friday will help bring that price down and keep some cash in your wallet.\n\nDon't just buy something because it's a good deal. \"My advice to shoppers is do some research in general to find a few different options (generally three to five styles) you genuinely like the sound of and check back in for sales,\" said Wu.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

            "article_content": "Trend Micro Premium Security Suite MSRP $149.95 Score Details \u201cTrend Micro antivirus has a great track record of defending against online threats and offers several affordable price tiers.\u201d Pros Near perfect protection for 11 years\n\nQuick and helpful 24/7 support\n\nAffordable multidevice plans\n\nReasonable renewal cost Cons Free app lacks real-time protection\n\nTable of Contents Table of Contents Tiers and pricing Design Features Support Privacy and security Is Trend Micro right for you?\n\nHackers are learning new tricks so Trend Micro recently updated its antivirus packages with new features like AI app safeguards and browser notification scam protection. I tested the latest version to find out how it compares to the best antivirus software on the market.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nI researched Trend Micro\u2019s pricing, noting the features and coverage for each. Next, I reviewed its flagship Premium Security Suite, testing app usability, malware protection ratings, customer service, and more to help you decide whether it\u2019s the best solution for you.\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nTrend Micro has several price tiers, starting at $15 per year for the basic Antivirus+ subscription for one device. That\u2019s even more affordable than the least expensive Avast antivirus plan. It can scan for malware on your computer, block website threats, and alert you to scams.\n\nYou probably own more than one device, so a more expensive plan like the $35 Internet Security plan that covers three devices makes more sense. For $4 more annually, you can install Trend Micro Maximum Security on five computers and mobile devices.\n\nThe top tier is Trend Micro\u2019s Premium Security Suite. For $45 annually, it protects up to 10 devices. You get a VPN, $1 million in identity theft insurance, and 24/7 support.\n\nTrend Micro offers free 30-day trials of all four cybersecurity subscriptions, so you can ensure it suits your needs before committing.\n\nTrend Micro also offers HouseCall, a free virus scanner that checks if your computer is infected and clears active malware. However, it\u2019s not as effective as a full antivirus since it can\u2019t prevent malware until it\u2019s installed, potentially harvesting data and damaging your system.\n\nAVG offers a better free antivirus solution, offering real-time protection as well as malware cleanup for one device\n\nDesign\n\nWindows installation was quick and the app displayed a QR code to direct me to the iOS App Store or Play Store to get the mobile app and prompted me to install a Trend Micro browser extension.\n\nSwitching back to the app, I was greeted with a green checkmark showing I was protected from malware. I used the large green scan button to complete a quick scan to verify my computer wasn\u2019t infected.\n\nTrend Micro\u2019s dashboard is cleaner and friendlier than most antivirus apps. Above the central scan button, four tabs let me see device options like scheduled virus scans and PC health reviews, privacy checking, data protection, and parental controls.\n\nThe help and account menus are easy to access at the top right, and a gear to the right of the scan button lets me dig deeper into settings to fine-tune how the app works.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe most important part of antivirus software is how well it identifies threats and blocks them before personal data is at risk. I was impressed by Trend Micro\u2019s near-perfect track record in ongoing evaluations by independent cybersecurity lab AV-Test.\n\nTrend Micro antivirus earned six out of six in 59 of 69 test periods spanning 11 years. Zero-day attacks accounted for the 10 misses, which isn\u2019t a surprise since those are the hardest to block since there\u2019s no advance warning of the threat.\n\nAV-Test doesn\u2019t judge harshly for vulnerabilities of this type and Trend Micro received 5.5-star ratings on those occasions. Trend Micro\u2019s track record is almost as good as leading antivirus solutions like Norton and Bitdefender.\n\nI spot-checked Trend Micro Premium Security Suite by visiting Wicar.org, a malware test website. With my normal browser security disabled, I ran every test. Trend Micro\u2019s browser extension blocked all 13 malware downloads and browser hacks.\n\nSatisfied I was safe from viruses, I moved on to the other features. Trend Micro Premium Security Suite includes a premium VPN. I tried a server in the U.K. and the BBC\u2019s iPlayer thought I was a local.\n\nWhen antivirus software includes a VPN, it\u2019s rarely fast enough for the best quality streaming, but Trend Micro\u2019s VPN was quite fast, reaching a download speed of 343Mbps overseas. That\u2019s as fast as the best dedicated streaming VPNs.\n\nTrend Micro says its AI app protection feature prevents tampering with AI models. Another new feature identifies and blocks malicious browser notifications.\n\nOverall, Trend Micro Premium Security Suite is a very complete solution for privacy and security concerns, preventing viruses, protecting me from existing malware, and blocking a variety of threats.\n\nSupport\n\nTrend Micro offers phone support for all customers and 24/7 live chat support for Premium subscribers. I tried the chat option, and an AI quickly answered with useful information, demonstrating a good understanding of my question about the built-in VPN and providing a link to a support article for more details.\n\nI asked for a human anyway to check the responsiveness. I filled in my name and email address, then a live agent was immediately available to help.\n\nI asked about the difference between quick and full scans and learned the full scan looks for dormant malware as well as active threats. I was pleased with the prompt and helpful replies from both the chatbot and the live agent.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nTrend Micro is a well-known and trusted name in cybersecurity that\u2019s been protecting consumers from online threats for decades and helping businesses secure LANs before the internet began.\n\nThe terms and conditions indicate the company only uses your data to provide the service you pay for. For example, a Trend Micro privacy notice during installation suggested I shouldn\u2019t use the anti-spam, anti-scam, or password protection features if I wanted to opt out of data collection. These features require access to email contents and login details to provide more thorough protection.\n\nRegarding Trend Micro\u2019s internal security, I found a minor customer data breach in 2019 caused by a rogue employee who sold data from the support database. This affected less than 1% of all Trend Micro customers. Still, any leak of personal data is worth noting.\n\nI haven\u2019t noticed any increase in spam after using Trend Micro Premium Security Suite, and I trust the company to keep my data private.\n\nIs Trend Micro right for you?\n\nTrend Micro offers several tiers of protection, from a well-rated antivirus app for one computer to a full-featured cybersecurity suite that protects all your devices.\n\nFor malware prevention, Trend Micro earned a place among the best antivirus software available. The ease of use, friendly layout, and added features of the Premium Security Suite make it worth the extra investment.\n\nDespite the top protection performance and robust options, it\u2019s one of the least expensive and best values on antivirus software you can find. That said, there are often significant savings available from competitors, so check out the best deals on antivirus software if you\u2019re looking for a bargain."
