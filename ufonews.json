        "article_content": "Netflix\u2019s \u2018Unsolved Mysteries: The Roswell UFO Incident\u2019 sheds light on the controversial Roswell UFO crash incident of 1947. On one hand, the government allegedly covered up the truth by claiming that it was an experimental balloon aircraft that crashed. On the other hand, UFO enthusiasts believed that in addition to the crashing of an actual UFO, bodies of aliens were also recovered. The episode consists of in-depth interviews with some of the experts in the field, including Donald Schmitt, who shared his opinion on the subject.\n\nDonald Schmitt Has Made Significant Contributions to UFO Research\n\nDonald Raymond Schmitt\u2019s journey to success was not short or easy. After graduating from Hartford Union High School, he earned his Bachelor\u2019s degree from Concordia University Wisconsin. He also attended Milwaukee Area Technical College for higher studies. Given his interest in UFOs and related subjects, he organized five archaeological dig projects at the 1947 Rowell crash site, with the first one in 1989. The next two digs came after more than a decade, in 2002, followed by 2006. The previous two digs were conducted in 2013 and 2016. His efforts were so impressive that the central theme of \u2018The Roswell Crash: Startling New Evidence\u2019 was based on the second dig.\n\nIn the 1970s, Donald used to work as a special investigator for the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the art director for the International UFO Reporter and the scientific consultant to the Air Force Project Blue Book. So, when the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies in Chicago was founded, he became the Director of Special Investigations and retired from the post after serving for a decade. Apart from being a member of Holy Hill Basilica Choir, he was also the president of Hartford Community Chorus at some point. Donald was also employed at Bloom and Associates as an art director/consultant and at Stellar Productions. Formerly, he was also the Wisconsin State Director of MUFON.\n\nInterestingly, he also co-produced the 2020 documentary \u2018The Phenomenon,\u2019 which centers on the unidentified aerial phenomenon. Starting in 2019, he is a co-founder of the International Coalition on Extraterrestrial Research (ICER), where he serves as the North American Representative. Furthermore, he is currently the co-founder of the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico. There, he is appointed as a board advisor and a lead investigator.\n\nThe Best-Selling Author\u2019s Debut Book is Now a Golden Globe-Nominated Movie\n\nDonald R. Schmitt has also dabbled in the field of writing and has authored several books. The former special investigator published his debut book, \u2018UFO Crash at Roswell\u2019 in 1991, sharing the title of co-author with Kevin D. Randle. Chronicling the 1947 Roswell UFO incident, the book garnered several eyeballs and ended up getting adapted into a movie for the screen by Arthur L. Kopit and Jeremy Kagan for the latter\u2019s movie, \u2018Roswell.\u2019 Starring Kyle MacLachlan and Martin Sheen in pivotal roles, the 1994 film also earned a nomination for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television at the Golden Globes in 1995. Interestingly, the Golden Globe nod is what Donald considers his most remarkable accomplishment in life.\n\nOver the years, he has made great strides in the world of writing by not only penning his observations in articles but also full-fledged books. Another of his books, \u2018Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the 60-Year Cover-Up,\u2019 which he co-authored with Thomas J. Carey, sat on the throne of the top-selling UFO-themed book across the globe for two years \u2014 2007 and 2008. According to reports, Stellar Productions has optioned the book for the movie, \u2018Majic Men.\u2019 Donald has earned the title of best-selling author not once nor twice but seven times (author/co-author) for many of his titles, such as \u2018The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell,\u2019 \u2018Roswell: The Chronological Pictorial,\u2019 \u2018The Children of Roswell,\u2019 and \u2018Inside the Real Area 51.\u2019 Not just that, Donald has also graced the television screens to share his insight on all things UFO by featuring on \u2018Oprah,\u2019 \u2018CBS 48 Hours,\u2019 \u2018Larry King Live,\u2019 and many more.\n\nDonald Schmitt and His Wife Lead a Private Yet Fulfilling Married Life\n\nThough the professional life of Donald R Schmitt is in the public eye, the personal aspects are something he prefers to keep private. He has been blessed with the companionship of his lovely wife of many years, Marie, and together they have weaved a beautiful life with love, compassion, and understanding. The investigative author has never hesitated to profess his affection and gratitude for his wife for all the support and faith she has shown for and in him since they tied the knot.\n\nIn fact, a testament to that would be the heartwarming shout-out he gave the love of his life in the Acknowledgement section of his 2017 book, titled \u2018Cover-Up at Roswell: Exposing the 70-Year Conspiracy to Suppress the Truth.\u2019 It read: \u201cAnd finally, I will shout it from the highest roof that I am truly blessed with a wife who loves me for being me.\u201d Apart from the fact that his father passed on before his mother, Viola, not much is known about his familial life. As of writing, Donald and his wife seemingly reside in their peaceful ranch in the small community of Hubertus in Washington County, Wisconsin.\n\nRead More: Kevin Randle: Where is the Ufologist Now?"

        "article_content": "At the end of August, I raced the masters gravel national championships; my first ever Nationals in any event, despite having raced bikes for the better part of 20 years since my early teens.\n\nIt was raced partly as part of a race-prep feature we wanted to do here at Cyclingnews, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't super excited at the prospect.\n\nA few months prior, with the race on the horizon, I decided I couldn't line up at such an event with an ill-prepared bike. I spend my working day reading and writing about aero hacks and marginal gains, so to ignore the potential gains on my own setup felt like sacrilege.\n\nAfter all, I firmly believe that tech can improve performance on all terrains. Given riders such as Dan Bigham and Dylan Johnson can push the envelope of equipment optimisation - on what we can only assume is a significantly smaller budget of both time and money than their WorldTour-funded counterparts - it confuses me to see pro teams and pro riders not take advantage of what are seemingly easy wins. It clearly works too, Bigham has since made a career out of it, optimising himself to a World Hour Record title, and enjoying a spell at Ineos Grenadiers before a recent move to Bora Hansgrohe.\n\nOn the road, optimisation primarily surrounds chasing aero savings, but with its slower speeds and rougher terrain, gravel is a little more complex. Aero still makes up most of the overall resistance at race speeds of around 30-35km/h, but rolling resistance makes up a significantly greater portion. Grip, handling and gearing are of greater importance too.\n\nFor my race, I wanted to find a bike that blended aerodynamics, racy geometry, and a decent weight. I wanted wide tyres to improve my rolling resistance and a wide range of gears to tackle the varying gradients of hills.\n\nThroughout the past few months, I've been pulling together a gravel superbike that tackles all of those things well, but in a way that's a little more subtle when compared to the likes of Chase Wark's crazy Lauf Siegla and Dylan Johnson's Felt with shaved tyres - both of which seen in our Unbound 2024 tech gallery.\n\nGet The Leadout Newsletter The latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n(Image credit: Josh Croxton)\n\nThe frame: Ridley ASTR RS\n\nAny superbike build needs a strong starting point, and what better place to start than a brand new, unreleased gravel race bike, ridden to 4th place at Unbound?\n\nAs mentioned, I wanted a lightweight, aero frame with big tyre clearance, and there aren't too many of those around. The 3T Extrema Italia is one of them, with 57mm tyre clearance, but at 10kg for a full build when my colleague Will reviewed it, it wasn't the perfect choice. The Lauf Siegla could have also been an option, with similar clearance but less aero optimisation.\n\nDuring this research phase, out of pure chance, I received an email from Ridley sharing details of its soon-to-be-released bike.\n\nCalled the ASTR RS, it has an aero frame, a frame weight of 890g, and when run 1x it can accept tyres as wide as 52mm. Even better is that it comes with 36cm handlebars in my size. It's a bike that, as concluded in my recent Ridley ASTR RS review, I truly believe is the future of gravel race bikes.\n\nI considered going even narrower with the crazy Lambda bars that Will tested earlier this year, but with the one-piece cockpit of the Ridley being designed around the frame, I felt the aerodynamic benefits of going narrower would be offset somewhat by switching to a separate bar/stem with external cables. Without a wind tunnel to test it empirically, I decided to play it safe (and easy) and use the bars that were already fitted to the bike.\n\nThe new SRAM Red XPLR AXS groupset is 1x13, with a super-durable rear derailleur (Image credit: Josh Croxton)\n\nSRAM Red XPLR AXS groupset and Zipp 303 XPLR wheels\n\nAnother stroke of luck while planning came through the launch of SRAM's new flagship gravel groupset, complete with progressive new Zipp wheels.\n\nThe groupset, Red XPLR AXS, is 1x13, uses the excellent new hoods from the recently launched Red AXS road groupset, and leans on SRAM's mountain bike Transmission for some clever new gravel-specific componentry. Among which, the Full Mount UDH mount for the rear derailleur with provides immediate alignment, the 'Magic Pulley Wheel' which lets them keep spinning if they get blocked with debris, and the fact that the rear mech can be disassembled, with individual parts available to rebuild it in the case of damage.\n\nWith its launch, the decision of which groupset to use became an easy one. I am a big fan of GRX Di2, especially the hood shape and braking power, but I didn't think I'd need the additional range of a 2x chainset and I'd heard good things about this new groupset in Tom's Red XPLR AXS review.\n\nAlongside the groupset, SRAM also launched a crazy-wide set of wheels, the Zipp 303 XPLR SW, which have a 32mm internal width. That's 3mm wider than the next widest I can find (the 3T Discus 45/40) and a full 8mm wider than the DT Swiss GRC 1400 wheels that come standard on the ASTR RS (while weighing nigh-on the same!)\n\nTheir only problem is that tyre choice is currently limited to a handful of approved options including the Goodyear XPLR (designed with the wheel) and some of Schwalbe's range. Regardless of that, I had to give them a go.\n\nGoodyear's XPLR Inter tyres are designed to offer a seamless transition to the sidewall (Image credit: Josh Croxton)\n\nTyre choice\n\nLeading into the race, with tyre choice so limited for the wheels, I had a couple of compatible options at my disposal.\n\nThe first was the Goodyear XPLR Inter, which bears a fairly light-tread, but at 45mm is designed to work aerodynamically with the rim.\n\nThe second was the Schwalbe G One R, a slightly more heavily treaded tyre in comparison. It has received numerous positive reviews from friends and colleagues alike, and one that I've previously gotten on well with too. The only downside was that this was narrower at 40mm. I felt as though I was wasting the massive tyre clearance offered by the ASTR frame, but the wider 45mm option was unavailable at the time.\n\nWith relentless rain hitting Gatehouse of Fleet where the race would be held in the weeks prior, but a fast-drying course with a long road section, I was unsure of the choice, so took both to the Airbnb I'd be staying at for the days leading into the race.\n\n(Image credit: Josh Croxton)\n\nA day before the race, despite the sun shining at my Airbnb in the Lake District, an email came through from the organisers saying that the car park for the race was so flooded that it was unusable, and with that I decided I'd have to use the Schwalbe's heavier tread and accept the narrower width. As it transpired, the 40mm tyres actually measured closer to 45mm on those rims anyway, so I don't feel I lost much, and the sidewall-to-rim transition was clean, as per Zipp's intentions when designing the rim.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that, ahead of a later race, I tried to run Vittoria's Air Liner Gravel Light inside the wheels, but they were so wide that the liner simply sat in the channel and offered very little protection. For this reason, SRAM actively says not to use a liner, which might be a reason to avoid them.\n\nI instead switched to the DT Swiss wheels, complete with Vittoria Air Liner inside a Terreno Dry 2.0-in tyre. Although around 500g heavier in total, this unlocked an ability to roll over pretty much everything in the bike's path.\n\nThe CeramicSpeed UFO Chain isn't the most noticable bit of tech, but it's worth as many as five watts. (Image credit: Josh Croxton)\n\nCeramicSpeed bearings and chain\n\nIt seems a superbike build isn't complete in 2024 without a mention of ceramic bearings, and who better than CeramicSpeed - arguably the market leader in the space - to turn to for some extra free speed via reduced friction?\n\nWith the Ridley ASTR RS using a press-fit bottom bracket, I sourced an equivalent from the Danish brand, alongside a pre-treated raceday chain from its UFO series.\n\nThe UFO chain alone is said to be worth two to five watts, and there's an additional - albeit unquantified - saving from the bottom bracket. While the cost per watt saving isn't the best you can get, this was a no-brainer for me on such an important race.\n\nI did want to add in the brand's Aero OverSized Pulley Wheel too, but with SRAM's new groupset having only just launched, a compatible system is yet to be made available. Maybe that's one for next year's build!\n\n(Image credit: Josh Croxton)\n\nApidura bags\n\nWhile not available in time for nationals, for a later race, I optimised the bike even further using a set of Apidura bags that have been designed specifically for this frame.\n\nThis comprises a frame bag that fills the space behind the head tube and a top tube bag that sits behind the stem. Together, they are said to be worth 2.6 watts at 36km/h (the winning average speed of the men's Unbound 2024). Ridley Classified rider, Piotr Havik, used them for Unbound where he finished 4th, and I'm told he continues to use them - empty in many races - simply for the aero gain. Why wouldn't you?\n\nThe next build?\n\nWith a goal of qualifying for Worlds in 2025, my mind is currently bouncing ideas around for the next build. Should I run 2.2in tyres on discs? Maybe those 22cm Lambda handlebars, or perhaps Speeco's ABB bar? Can I run Classified with a 60T chainring?\n\nWhat would you add? Email me and let's build something crazy."

        "article_content": "AI tools usually require cloud computing access to have enough power to run, but your future AI usage may end up not needing more than is available on your device if Qualcomm has its way. The tech giant has unveiled a new system called the Qualcomm AI Orchestrator aimed at integrating AI tools and experiences and keeping the process on your devices.\n\nQualcomm AI Orchestrator incorporates all of your AI usage, including what you do on your computer, mobile device, and even in your car. The orchestrator takes personal preferences and the surrounding context into account when running to make the best use of what various accessible AI apps and services can provide.\n\nIt's the individual adaptation aspect that stands out as the biggest appeal of the AI Orchestrator. The AI uses information on your device about your contacts, where you travel regularly, what you do in a day, and even your go-to apps to personalize the experience and make a personal knowledge graph. For instance, if you have an app that you rely on to reserve seats at a restaurant, the AI Orchestrator will use that app when recommending places to go and reserve a time if you ask. It's a more proactive approach than the standard query and response system you might be familiar with when doing text or voice searches.\n\nThe whole process is faster and safer because the AI is run on the device. That means you can store personal information without worrying about it being stolen or shared from a cloud server by malicious actors. It also makes the AI faster in its responses to you, even when taking up more power for multimodal interactions with voice and visuals.\n\nOrchestrated Life\n\n\u201cImagine a scenario where you start your day with a bunch of notifications on your phone,\u201d Qualcomm described in a blog post. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time to read them until your lunch break, so instead of reading all the notifications yourself, your generative AI assistant automatically creates a notification summary and can pick out important ones.\u201d\n\nThe Qualcomm AI Orchestrator is essentially the conductor of the \u2018orchestrator\u2019 of AI instruments, not only within a device but across multiple interfaces. So, the AI using your phone to set up your dinner reservation is also linked to your car navigation and your calendar on your home computer so that you can get to the restaurant and have an alert up that you\u2019re not responding to emails at that time.\n\nIn some ways, this sounds a lot like the personal intelligence and contextual relevance Apple Intelligence is set to bring to Siri in the coming months. The difference is that Apple Intelligence is only supporting certain iPhones, Macs, and iPads. Qualcomm AI Orchestrator could end up on all sorts of devices running the latest Qualcomm chips.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

It may end up helping run your smart home devices and even take over the phone calls with customer service agents you don\u2019t want to make. Even if Qualcomm\u2019s dream of redefining the way you interact with AI is unlikely to happen any time soon, the concept of interconnected but on-device AI processing could prove popular enough that others take a cue from Qualcomm in their next line of AI products."

        "article_content": "Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, \u2018CTRL\u2019 revolves around Nella Awasthi, a popular content creator whose social media relationship with her boyfriend, Joe Mascarenhas, comes to an end after she catches him cheating on her. Subsequently, Nella installs an AI app named CTRL that helps her erase Joe from her digital life. However, unbeknownst to her, the app takes rapid control over every aspect of her life, blurring the lines between reality and the virtual world.\n\nThe Netflix thriller presents a cerebral film that latches on to growing concerns within the modernizing digital world. With data, social media, and personal privacy colliding within the screenlife drama\u2019s plot, a grave and chilling account is presented with unflinching authenticity. It asks valid questions about individual awareness, the practices of the dark web, and how invasive technology can be when left unchecked and employed as a commodity. Therefore, the film\u2019s basis seems tied to prescient issues of the contemporary world and the reality faced by everyone with access to the internet. But is that really the case?\n\nCTRL Focuses on the Dark Side of Social Media\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 is a fictional story penned by director Vikramaditya Motwane and co-writers Avinash Sampath and Sumukhi Suresh. The movie explores the pitfalls of social media culture through a gripping thriller storyline, punctuating it with incisive forays into the internet\u2019s toxic elements. While the story begins in a relatively happy place, it takes a slow descent into the issues plaguing ordinary people in relation to their digital interactions. Probing questions about authenticity are posed as the protagonist, Nella, finds herself living a lie in front of the camera but leading a completely different one offscreen. Additionally, the darkest aspects of the narrative come to the fore when an invasive AI begins exploiting the insecurities of human emotions through its own agendas.\n\nThe movie mainly examines the exploitative nature of social media and how memory, human emotion, and feelings can often get tied in a virtual setting, which often has no borders on its privacy. As people yearn for more, Nella finds herself catering to their needs by becoming the face of perfection but lacking the imperfections needed to sell reality. Director Vikramaditya stated that the film revolves around the concept of sharing oneself with the world without understanding the consequences that come from it. He explained, \u201cIt\u2019s all about \u2013 how much sharing is too much sharing and the dopamine hits likes and favourites give you. It\u2019s about how much you end up doing for social media. It\u2019s like a doomsday scenario and it\u2019s not impossible to believe this.\u201d\n\nCTRL is a Topical Thriller About the Commodification of Human Experience\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 derives most of its central tension from the battle between human free will and an authoritarian AI app that wants to dictate everything for its users. There is an Orwellian fantasy lurking in its premise. Parallels can be seen with how rapidly modernizing internet practices attempt to take away control from people\u2019s lives, particularly in the manner in which it preys on insecurities. It serves as the burning question of the film. Even Ananya Pandey, who plays Nella, chimed in on the topical concern by emphasizing how it can be particularly damaging for mostly the younger generation, who find themselves victim to a lot of seedy online elements and the mental challenges they pose at times.\n\nMemory also plays a major role in \u2018CTRL.\u2019 With most people\u2019s lives today stored in digital archives, a person\u2019s memories can be attached to their social media avatar. In the movie, this becomes a central topic and one that was inspired by other films. During the development process, the scriptwriters discussed the enduring legacy of \u2018Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u2019 as a key influence, particularly in the manner in which it explores erasing a loved one from one\u2019s life. The same concept rears its head throughout the Netflix screenlife thriller. The director also revealed that the Spike Jonze-directed science fiction movie, \u2018Her,\u2019 had some influence over the writing. However, he hailed the Michel Gondry directorial as a masterpiece, even if it does not touch upon the topic of AI.\n\nThe Ctrl App is a Fictional AI Service With an Invasive Protocol\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 is built around the futuristic service provided by the titular AI app that Nella installs on her laptop, which eventually takes control over her life. It is a made-up application conceived by the scriptwriters Vikramaditya Motwane, Avinash Sampath, and Sumukhi Suresh. While it is not based on any real-life apps, Vikramaditya stated that it would serve as an interesting reflection of how AI has become a major hot-button issue in today\u2019s society. \u201cGiven the conversations about AI, we realized that there was a lot more that we could say about social media, data and privacy in the guide of a straightforward thriller,\u201d the director said. As such, some vague parallels can be drawn between the CTRL app and chatbot AIs like ChatGPT, especially how it is capable of mimicking natural human dialogue.\n\nHowever, in terms of the app\u2019s personalized aspects, digital assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa have more similarities. The story focuses primarily on the CTRL app\u2019s invasive nature and how it eventually takes over Nella\u2019s life and dictates every aspect, including her schedule and emotional needs. In many ways, it also provides an outlet for people to alleviate their loneliness, which is a prime concern in the case of Nella, who goes through a very public breakup and finds herself ostracized on the internet. It speaks to a greater issue converging on modern society, specifically in the domain of ethics, and whether human insecurities might be harnessed to the advantages of AI services like CTRL. Still, for the time being, it is a fictional service with no ties to reality.\n\nRead More: Best Thriller Movies on Netflix"

        "article_content": "\u00d7\n\nMilford to hold talks, signings in Durango and Farmington\n\nRetired Navajo Ranger Stanley Milford Jr. has seen some things in his life that can\u2019t always be explained.\n\n\u00d7\n\nMilford, who split his time growing up between his mother\u2019s house in Oklahoma and with his father on the Navajo Reservation, said not only was his upbringing between two different geographic areas, the two were culturally different as well: Oklahoma was more \u201cmainstream and Western\u201d while the reservation was steeped in \u201cNative American culture.\u201d\n\nWhen he grew up, he graduated from the United States Indian Police Academy and became a Navajo Ranger, where he and his partner, Jonathan Dover, investigated paranormal cases called in by residents. For those who have been in the area a while, he also cut his teeth in law enforcement by helping during the 1998 Four Corners manhunt for the three men \u2013 Jason McVean, Robert Mason and Alan \u201cMonte\u201d Pilon \u2013 who killed Cortez Police Officer Dale Claxton and took off into the Colorado/Utah desert.\n\nHe\u2019s just released his memoir, \u201cThe Paranormal Ranger,\u201d and will be at Maria\u2019s Bookshop and in Farmington to discuss it. He\u2019s also been featured on shows, including Nexflix\u2019s reboot of \u201cUnsolved Mysteries.\u201d\n\nIf you go WHAT: Author Event and Book-Signing With Stanley Milford Jr. and his new release, \u201cThe Paranormal Ranger.\u201d WHEN: 6-8 p.m. Oct. 10. WHERE: Maria\u2019s Bookshop, 960 Main Ave. MORE INFORMATION: Visit https://tinyurl.com/y67bn8sx.\n\nThe memoir is a mix of Milford\u2019s autobiography interspersed with chapters about the Navajo origin story.\n\nMilford and Dover first got into paranormal investigations when they were called to take over the case of a Navajo grandmother, who lost a sheep.\n\n\u201cShe recounted this story of this Bigfoot stepping over into her sheep corral and taking off with one of her sheep,\u201d he said. \u201cShe called the department, and two Rangers were assigned, and one of the Rangers was a comedian; he\u2019s just constantly joking and laughing and carrying on. It\u2019s just his personality, but I think the grandmother was probably offended by that, and she contacted the chief ranger and probably chewed him out.\u201d\n\nBecause of her call, the chief called a department meeting, and told everyone that no matter how strange a case may seem, it\u2019s real to the person making the call, and every case was to be investigated as such, even if responding officers didn\u2019t believe it. And then, Milford said, the chief looked over at him and Dover and said they were going to oversee these cases and manage them.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s how it happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as us being assigned to it, we weren\u2019t sitting over there raising our hands to be the Navajo \u2018X Files\u2019 or whatever. That wasn\u2019t the case. We were assigned to do it, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nMilford said the idea to include the origin story into his memoir was inspired by a case in 2009 of a haunting he investigated in Window Rock, Arizona.\n\n\u201cIt was an office space, and the director had said \u2018my staff are experiencing all kinds of what they\u2019re describing as paranormal phenomena.\u2019 She approached the chief ranger at the time and asked if he had anybody that could come in and validate any of the stuff that they were claiming,\u201d he said. \u201cI put together a team of four individuals. We went in on two nights, and one of the prominent things about that case was coins would materialize and fall out of nothingness, out of thin air.\u201d\n\nAnd even after all this time, he said the coins appearing followed him: \u201cLast month, I had the most coins that I\u2019ve ever experienced ... this phenomenon still happens to me to this very day. Witnessing that with your own eyes, it really changes your worldview.\n\n\u201cIt made me realize that, like with the Navajo, in their creation story, they talk about this idea of coming through these different worlds into the physical world that we\u2019re in right now. Some of them describe either four worlds or five worlds, depending on the version of it. It got me thinking that, like with these coins, these coins are manifesting in our physical world from somewhere else. It got me to thinking about string theory and the idea of other planes of existence or dimensions.\u201d\n\nMilford said he starting thinking even further about different paranormal phenomenon that people refer to, \u201clike Bigfoot and UFOs and extraterrestrials, even the witchcraft, even the skinwalkers and things like that. I think they use the these other dimensions coming and going into our physical world from these other dimensions. That\u2019s how we experience it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn and I lived in the woods at times, being Navajo Rangers right in the heavily forested high mountain areas, and we did not find the evidence that supports these things live out there,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou can find all of that with bears, mountain lions, cougars, coyotes and everything that lives out there. You can see where it beds down. You can see where it goes out and hunts and drinks. You can find all of that evidence of that ... but the thing with the Bigfoot, you don\u2019t see all of that evidence, although twice I\u2019ve witnessed this thing that people refer to as Bigfoot. And so I know that these things do happen, and they do exist. So it could interdimensional.\u201d\n\nAnd while he\u2019s had his share of people who don\u2019t believe in what he\u2019s seen and believes, Milford said the key is to be open-minded.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always going to have people that are going to take the opposite 180 view from what you\u2019re talking about, and I understand that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the message that John and I are conveying out there is much more important than listening to those people that are going to put it down. And John and I are open minded; we were very open minded. I remember one time we presented in Dulce, New Mexico, at one other UFO thing. There was an elderly Native woman that came up to us. She was in her mid 80s, and she came up to us with tears in her eyes and hugged us after we did our presentation. She said, \u2018Thank you for doing what you do.\u2019 She went on to convey a story about when she was a young girl encountering her UFO and her family members are standing around her with their jaws wide open because she never, ever shared that experience with them. I think, out of fear of being ridiculed or shunned, or whatever it might be, she never shared that experience. She thanked us and she said, you\u2019re giving people that have these experiences more or less a forum to be able to come together and share these experiences with like-minded people that are willing to listen.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s really, ultimately what the book is: to let people know that these experiences do happen, and to be respectful of others that do have these experiences, and letting people know these people aren\u2019t crazy, and they\u2019re not alone. And I would dare to say worldwide, if you looked at every family on this planet, if you looked in the history of their family, there\u2019s probably somebody within that family that has had some type of so-called supernatural or paranormal experience, whether it\u2019s seeing UFOs and lights in the sky or hauntings. I think it\u2019s much more common than we could ever imagine.\u201d\n\nkatie@durangoherald.com"

        "article_content": "AI, PoS, And ROI: An alphabet Soup Of 21st Century Drug Development\n\nBy Remco Jan Geukes Foppen, Vincenzo Gioia and Carlos N. Velez\n\nThis article is part one of a two-part series.\n\nPart 1: AI for rapid Drug Discovery\n\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of pharmaceutical development, AI promises to revolutionize the entire drug discovery and development process, impacting target discovery, clinical trial design, site selection, and even post-approval competitive monitoring and analysis. The latest AI models can dramatically accelerate the research pace supporting the pharmaceutical industry. Today, the industry faces increasingly complex challenges, such as chasing \u201cundruggable\u201d targets or developing bispecific antibodies. The industry is also seeking ways to lower the cost of drug discovery and development that, according to recent estimates, can easily exceed $1 billion.\n\nIn addition to increasing drug development speed and reducing costs, the adoption of AI models can potentially increase the probability of a drug completing Phase 2, the second major phase of clinical trials for a new drug, where the drug is tested on a larger group of patients to assess its efficacy and monitor side effects. Successful Phase 2 studies are a critical milestone in drug development. Therefore, anything which can help achieve this milestone could result in lower costs, faster times to approval, and improved likelihood of successful approvals and product launches.\n\nIn the first article of this two-part series, we identify and explain the AI technologies and tools that are transforming the drug discovery and development landscape, specifically focusing on use cases to accelerate drug discovery and clinical development. For the second article in the series, we will answer the following two questions: First, does the higher speed and lower cost with which AI can identify new molecules translate into an increase in the Probability of Success (PoS) in the crucial Phase 2 stage of clinical trials? And second, what is the financial benefit(s) of an AI-driven increase in PoS?\n\nThe AI Toolbox\n\nAI is a group of technologies that can be adopted individually or in combination to perform a specific task. These technologies resemble tools in a toolbox, enabling us to choose and use the right tool(s) at the right moment(s) for the right problem(s).\n\nFig. 1: AI tools representation\n\nAI enables machines to think and solve problems like humans. It encompasses machine learning, where machines learn from examples, and deep learning, which uses multi-layered networks for complex tasks like facial recognition. Generative AI, including large language models (LLMs), represents the latest evolution, allowing machines to create new content and process language in sophisticated ways.\n\nAI technologies, particularly generative AI, enable computers to create new content, such as text and images. As companies digitally transform, they unlock diverse data sources. These technologies power everyday tools from voice assistants to recommendation systems, making computers increasingly helpful. While the expanding AI toolbox offers new opportunities, it also presents challenges like the risk of AI hallucinations.\n\nHow GenAI Accelerates Drug Discovery\n\nGenerative AI, powered by deep learning, analyzes vast and diverse datasets across scientific literature, genomics, and experimental results, uncovering insights that might escape human researchers. It rapidly explores chemical spaces, generating and evaluating millions of potential molecular structures faster than traditional methods. This expands the range of drug candidates and allows AI models to predict molecular interactions with protein targets, identifying promising compounds and potential side effects early in the development process. Multi-objective optimization capabilities enable AI to simultaneously refine multiple desired properties of a drug, such as its efficacy, safety, and bioavailability, a complex and time-consuming task when approached through conventional means. Traditional drug discovery processes can be applied in silico only if LLMs are repurposed to drug discovery needs with domain-specific algorithms like structure prediction, homology, docking, protein design and possibly for in-house requirements to accommodate intellectual property.\n\nCurrently, AI is used most commonly in small molecule drug discovery, drug target discovery, and drug molecule design in oncology and CNS. While some may perceive the integration of AI in drug discovery as conflicting between overhyped and underestimated, many companies of all sizes, from startups to multinational companies are actively utilizing AI as point solutions or as fully AI-embedded end-to-end approaches. Leveraging years of confidential training data to discover and develop new drug candidates, these AI models continue to grow in size and complexity, and require increasingly advanced computational resources, including high-end GPUs that support GenAI, to process proprietary datasets securely. Interestingly, a small minority of companies have no current plans to implement AI/ML.\n\nThe integration of multiple data types, such as text, images, and sound, combined with LLMs enhances the granularity of analysis over single modality. There is a growing trend toward multimodal biomedical AI, and expectations are that efforts will be made for the first multimodal model to receive FDA approval. With these developments one will have to take into account the semantic divergence in the meaning and application of AI in order to achieve a common understanding, and to understand where hallucination risks occur so that the required validation processes for the outcomes are deployed. As regulators emphasize interpretability and explainability, feature importance of machine learning in disease prediction, in drug design and in clinical trial outcomes are becoming increasingly important to identify objective indicators. With new generative and multimodal AI, unanticipated and opportunistic outputs emerge, including the risk of hallucinations. Ultimately, the combination of GenAI and LLMs holds immense potential to revolutionize the drug discovery process, making it more efficient, precise, and innovative.\n\nAI-Focused Biotechs: Increasing Research Speed\n\nCurrently, a dozen AI-discovered drug candidates from various companies have entered in record time into Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, targeting a wide range of medical conditions. The first AI-designed drug to enter clinical trials with drug-like properties was DSP-1181, developed by a joint venture between Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma and Exscientia. The discovery phase for DSP-1181, aimed at treating obsessive-compulsive disorder, took only 12 months.\n\nInsilico Medicine showcased the capability to identify new drug targets and generate candidate molecules in just 18 months, further demonstrating the accelerated potential of AI in drug discovery. During the COVID-19 pandemic, BenevolentAI leveraged its AI platform to identify baricitinib as a potential treatment for the virus in just three days \u2014 an impressive example of rapid drug repurposing. Similarly, Verge Genomics advanced VRG50635, a small molecule inhibitor of PIKfyve for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), from research to clinic in just four years, successfully moving past Phase I trials. Many AI-enabled drug discovery programs now take less than four years to complete, compared to the typical five years or more required for the traditional discovery phase.\n\nIncreasing Speed With AI In Clinical Development\n\nAI is also revolutionizing clinical trials, from automating tasks to improving analytics and predictive modeling. The market for AI in clinical trials is rapidly expanding, with most reports projecting a CAGR of over 25%. However, estimates of current market size vary widely. Market.us reports a $174.1B market for 2023, largely driven by Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technologies, while Precedence Research estimates $1.6B. This discrepancy may partly stem from the increasing use of synthetic data in trials, such as developing synthetic control arms, which addresses patient privacy concerns and fills real-world data gaps.\n\nA recent FDA workshop highlighted AI's potential in trial optimization. Michael Lingzhi Li presented a case study with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, where interpretable AI predicted incidence rates at potential sites for their COVID-19 vaccine trial. This model adapted to changing conditions (such as COVID variants, mobility restrictions, release of vaccines, for example), resulting in 33% faster trials and 25% fewer participants. The interpretability of the model provided convincing arguments for the site selection, which as a consequence resulted in a diverse vaccine trial.\n\nAI tools are also enhancing trial operations, monitoring treatment response, improving patient engagement (reduction of patient drop out), and accelerating recruitment. In regulatory affairs, AI tracks global guidances \u2014 which as a reference are published around the world every 15 minutes \u2014 and predicts queries. These applications compound the speed improvements already seen in AI-assisted drug design.\n\nAI In Drug Discovery And Development: Faster\u2026Cheaper\u2026Better Value?\n\nAl-driven drug discovery is on the rise. Automating data analysis, and predicting outcomes with greater accuracy, result in drug candidates entering clinical trials in record time compared to traditional drug development. Beyond speed, AI promises to reduce costs by minimizing experimental overhead and even improving trial efficiency. This would not only cut financial burdens but also improve the quality of drug candidates balancing drug properties like safety and efficacy, and increasing the chances of approval and success in the market.\n\nIn the second installment of our series, we will examine real cost savings attributed to the use of AI, and whether AI can consistently improve the probability of success and likelihood of approval for new drug candidates.\n\nAbout The Authors:\n\nRemco Jan Geukes Foppen Ph.D., is an AI and life sciences expert.

But if you stuck a powerful enough microphone in the soil, you\u2019d be surprised at how hopping it is, acoustically speaking. That has led some microbiologists to wonder: Are there sounds that actually encourage microorganisms to grow? And could serenading a fungus make it twist and shout?\n\nThe answer, published in a study on Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters, is yes. Playing sound to Trichoderma harzianum, a green microscopic fungus that defends tree roots from pathogens, led to growth rates seven times as fast as those of fungus grown in the sound of silence. If the laboratory findings can be replicated in nature, then sound could be an unexpected new tool for improving the health of forests, encouraging beneficial microbes to take root and thrive.\n\nIn recent years, scientists have put microphones in environments of all kinds, including tropical trees and coral reefs. In the process, they have discovered that an environment\u2019s sound can be linked to its biodiversity \u2014 often, the more complex the soundscape, the more diverse and healthy the inhabitants.\n\nResearch also shows that playing the sounds of intact ecosystems can help damaged ones recover. Off the coast of Adelaide, Australia, for instance, scientists found that the recorded sounds of healthy oyster reefs could lure new oyster larvae to areas destroyed by overfishing."

These changes are not significant, but they are noticeable nonetheless.\n\nThe iPhone 16 features a new, smaller camera design on the back that generally changes its look compared to last year\u2019s models. Unlike previous generations, the camera system is now pill-shaped rather than having a square cutout. It should remind many of the iconic iPhone X. It\u2019s gorgeous. The Apple phone is available in classic white, black, vibrant pink, ultramarine, and teal. The chassis is made of aluminum, while the back is color-infused glass. At just 6 ounces, the iPhone 16 is one of the lightest smartphones to date.\n\nThe Pixel 9 and the rest of the Pixel 9 series feature a more polished design than the previous generation. Some say the phone lineup reminds them of Apple\u2019s in terms of its cleaner look. This is evident in the stylish dual camera system on the back, which has evolved from a visor into a prominent flat-top island mountain. It\u2019s simply gorgeous and something to appreciate. The phone\u2019s satin-finish metal chassis has just the right amount of curvature to seamlessly blend in with the flat Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 rear panel, making it a pleasure to hold. Like the iPhone 16, you can purchase a Pixel 9 in white (Porcelain) or black (Obsidian). It\u2019s also available in beautiful Peony and Wintergreen. Because Google\u2019s phone has a larger display than Apple\u2019s, it weighs an ounce more than its competitor.\n\nThe iPhone 16 features a 6.1-inch OLED display, while the Pixel 9 has a slightly larger 6.3-inch OLED display. Both displays offer excellent resolution, though the iPhone 16 leads slightly in this aspect, with a higher pixels-per-inch count that means it\u2019s a bit sharper and crisper.\n\nIn addition to screen size, the Pixel 9 outperforms the iPhone 16 in terms of its display\u2019s peak brightness and refresh rate. The Pixel 9 boasts an impressive peak brightness of 2,700 nits, surpassing the iPhone 16\u2019s still respectable 2,000 nits.\n\nFurthermore, the Pixel 9\u2019s refresh rate of 120Hz matches that of most high-end smartphones, while the iPhone 16 is limited to 60Hz. That\u2019s similar to previous iPhone models, but it\u2019s holding back the regular iPhone 16 series. As a result, the Pixel 9 delivers smoother screen refreshes, which is particularly noticeable during activities such as gaming.\n\nWinner: Google Pixel 9\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: performance and software\n\nBoth phones feature new chipsets: the iPhone 16 has an A18, while the Google Pixel 9 has a Google Tensor G4.\n\nThe iPhone 16 has significantly improved performance this year, thanks to the chipset and 8GB of RAM. Although Apple claims a 30% faster CPU and 40% faster GPU, you might notice little difference in everyday use since the iPhone 15 was already relatively fast.\n\nHowever, that A18 chip has other benefits that are (or will be) noticeable. Specifically, it enables the updated Photographic Styles on the phone and the upcoming Apple Intelligence package. The former has been around since the iPhone 13. This time around, however, the camera feature has been significantly improved. There are more styles to choose from, and you can now also customize the tone and color of each one using an improved slider control. Apple Intelligence, which the company has not yet released, will bring artificial intelligence to the iPhone for the first time. Once the feature is released, we will better understand how good the A18 chip is \u2014 or perhaps isn\u2019t.\n\nThe iPhone 16 ships with iOS 18, and based on previous iPhone releases, you\u2019ll likely get six to seven software updates.\n\nCircling back to the Pixel 9, previous Tensor G chips had been criticized for performance problems. In particular, some past Pixel users complained about overheating issues and occasional stutters, depending on what was done on the device. We had no issues with the Tensor G4 with 12GB of RAM featured in the Pixel 9. The performance on the Pixel 9 was the smoothest and most enjoyable Pixel experience to date.\n\nThe Pixel 9 comes with Android 14 software. Google promises seven years of software updates, which means you can keep your device for a long time if you choose. The Pixel 9 ships with Google\u2019s built-in AI assistant, Gemini. Better still, Pixel 9 users get a free year of Gemini Advanced, which adds more intelligence. That\u2019s a savings of around $240 for the year.\n\nLeaving aside the issue of AI, which we\u2019ll get to below, both of these phones have high-tier performance and long update promises. As such, this has to be a tie.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: cameras\n\nCameras have always been a significant part of smartphones, and that\u2019s still the case with the iPhone 16 and Pixel 9.\n\nThe iPhone 16 features a 48-megapixel Fusion primary rear camera, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a 12MP selfie camera. The camera setup is quite similar to that of the iPhone 15, although there are a few notable changes.\n\nOne significant change is that the ultrawide camera now offers autofocus, allowing macro photography. Additionally, you can capture Spatial photos that can be viewed on an Apple Vision Pro. The primary camera also now has a new anti-reflective lens coating, and it can capture pictures with zero shutter lag, similar to the iPhone Pro models.\n\nOverall, we\u2019re happy with the iPhone 16\u2019s cameras. The primary camera is excellent, capturing detailed photos with really pleasing colors. It also focuses quickly, handles moving subjects well, and does a great job in lowlight environments. The ultrawide camera makes taking macro photos a treat, and the selfie camera is as reliable as ever on the iPhone.\n\nThe most significant change to the iPhone 16\u2019s growing list of camera tools is the addition of a physical Camera Control button. This button on every iPhone 16 series phone functions like a traditional camera shutter button, but offers more functionality due to its built-in capacitive sensor. The sensor allows you to access six options on a new camera menu: exposure, depth, zoom, cameras, styles, and tone. To navigate these options, you can slide your finger across the Camera Control, lightly press the button to select an option, and then adjust the chosen setting by sliding your finger again.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, but Camera Control seems like a fun new way to interact with your iPhone\u2019s camera. However, it might take you a little bit of time to get used to it.\n\nThe Pixel 9 also features two cameras on the rear: a 50MP primary camera and a 48MP wide-angle camera that enables a macro mode. The 10.5MP selfie camera also has autofocus.\n\nWhen testing the Pixel 9, we took many photos, and we came away impressed. The primary and wide-angle cameras shot sharp, colorful images that were never dull or underwhelming. We also enjoyed using the phone\u2019s Action Pan, which adds motion blur to moving objects, and the new Reimagine feature in Magic Editor, which allows you to change scenes based on your imagination.\n\nCasual photographers will enjoy using the cameras on both of these phones, as they are equipped with hardware and software features that will provide years of enjoyment.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: battery and charging\n\nThe battery life of both these phones is decent, but not exceptional, especially when compared to more expensive phones from the same companies. Despite them both being decent, one is better than the other.\n\nThe iPhone 16 has a 3,561 mAh battery, which should last a day without recharging. On the other hand, the Pixel 9 has a bigger 4,700mAh battery, allowing you to use it for a second day (at least for a while) before recharging.\n\nThe iPhone 16 theoretically supports 45-watt wired charging, but seems to be limited to around 20W most of the time. We tested the iPhone 16 with an Anker 747 and found that it charged from 5% to over 60% in 30 minutes. However, it took over an hour and a half to reach 100%. Charging from a low or dead battery to around 70% is relatively fast, but the final 30% takes a while. If you prefer MagSafe charging, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that the iPhone 16\u2019s charge speeds have increased from 15W to 30W. Apple\u2019s phone supports MagSafe, Qi2, and Qi wireless charging.\n\nThe Pixel 9 maxes out at 27W charging, similar to the iPhone. It could charge a dead battery to 53% in 30 minutes and get an entire charge in 92 minutes. The Google phone supports Qi wireless charging, but not Qi2.\n\nWe\u2019re giving this one to Google\u2019s phone, if only because it has a bigger and longer-lasting battery.\n\nWinner: Google Pixel 9\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: AI\n\nIn just a few weeks, Apple plans to release at least the initial components of Apple Intelligence to the general public. Within six months, every feature should finally be available. Apple Intelligence is designed to provide a secure, helpful, and intuitive AI experience. It will offer personalized writing assistance, new creative tools, improved Siri, and more.\n\nGoogle Gemini, also available for iPhone through the Google App, is designed to help users make everyday tasks easier and offer a more helpful Google Search experience. Like Apple Intelligence, it will help you write better, improve your images, and more.\n\nBecause Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t available, the Pixel 9 wins this category by default.\n\nWinner: Google Pixel 9\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: price and availability\n\nThe iPhone 16 costs $799 for the 128GB model and $899 for the 256GB model. There\u2019s also a 512GB model for $1,099. The Google Pixel 9\u2019s base 128GB model also costs $799. The 256GB version is available for $859 if you need more storage.\n\nThe Pixel scores points because its 256GB model is available for $40 less than the similarly equipped iPhone 16 model. However, it loses that point because only Apple offers a 512GB model.\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: verdict\n\nThis result may change in six months. However, for now, the Pixel 9 bests the iPhone 16 overall. Google\u2019s entry-level phone has much more going for it, from having a larger display and battery to offering an AI product right now when you open the box.\n\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t a bad phone; it\u2019s actually a terrific phone that currently lacks some of Apple\u2019s promised features.\n\nUltimately, an incomplete product cannot outperform a completed one. However, your decision will likely be based more on each phone\u2019s operating system. If you prefer Android, you\u2019ll choose the Pixel 9 and Android 14; if you\u2019re a fan of iOS, then the iPhone 16 with iOS 18 is the one for you."

        "article_content": "Shares of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) gained 27.3% in September, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The business intelligence software company, known for reinvesting its cash reserves in Bitcoin, generally trended upward along with the leading cryptocurrency. It also accelerated in mid-September, when the company said it would borrow another $700 million to refinance old debt and buy even more Bitcoin. And that's not all -- MicroStrategy's stock surged again when the new debt was expanded to $1.01 billion a few days later.\n\nMicroStrategy's continued Bitcoin-buying spree boosted the stock\n\nBitcoin prices rose 10.6% in September, boosted by a strengthening American economy. Crypto investors also expect the digital currency to take off fairly soon as a result of Bitcoin halving its mining rewards in April. Late 2024 or the first half of 2025 would be a reasonable starting point for the fourth halving-based price surge, based on market data from the first three halvings.\n\nWith 252,220 Bitcoins under its belt as of Sept. 19, MicroStrategy's digital currency reserve is worth roughly $15.6 billion today. That's the largest corporate Bitcoin position in the world according to Bitcoin Treasuries. It's no surprise to see this company's stock following the market trends of Bitcoin's price chart.\n\nThe massive Bitcoin position includes 7,420 new coins, bought with the portion of MicroStrategy's fresh debt that wasn't used to pay down an older batch of senior debt notes. Investors loved this upsized refinancing and the addition of more Bitcoin, judging by MicroStrategy's soaring stock. Share prices increased by 18.7% that week.\n\nDoes MicroStrategy's software business even matter anymore?\n\nMicroStrategy's stock was a fairly accurate proxy for Bitcoin investments from 2020 to early 2024. The software company separated from Bitcoin's price trends in February this year, as investors embraced its all-in approach to the Bitcoin opportunity. The price surge in March involved another debt-based Bitcoin purchase, underscoring MicroStrategy's commitment to its Bitcoin strategy.\n\nI mean, it's all about the digital Benjamins these days. The software business is profitable and service subscription sales increased 21% year over year in the second quarter. But Bitcoin is the power that moves the needle for MicroStrategy investors anyhow.\n\nFor example, MicroStrategy introduced a plethora of new features to its ONE software suite on Oct. 1, boosting the package's generative artificial intelligence (AI) powers and data analytics capability. Market makers yawned and dropped MicroStrategy's stock price 5% lower that day.\n\nSo MicroStrategy may be the stock for you if you expect Bitcoin to keep rising and want to invest in that trend via a standard stock. Or maybe you expect the company to finance massive long-term improvements to its software business from its rising Bitcoin reserves. Either way, MicroStrategy has become a pretty direct bet on Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency bears should look elsewhere. September's market action only strengthened that argument again.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MicroStrategy wasn\u2019t one of them.
